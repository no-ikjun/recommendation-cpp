 Both Orkney and Shetland saw a significant influx of Norwegian settlers during the late 8th and early 9th centuries . Vikings made the islands the headquarters of their pirate expeditions carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland . In response , Norwegian king Harald Hårfagre ( " Harald Fair Hair " ) annexed the Northern Isles , comprising Orkney and Shetland , in 875 . ( It is clear that this story , which appears in the Orkneyinga Saga , is based on the later voyages of Magnus Barelegs and some scholars believe it to be apocryphal . ) Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland , and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty . 
 However , Sigurd 's line barely survived him and it was Torf @-@ Einarr , Rognvald 's son by a slave , who founded a dynasty that controlled the islands for centuries after his death . He was succeeded by his son Thorfinn Skull @-@ splitter and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954 . Thorfinn 's death and presumed burial at the broch of Hoxa , on South Ronaldsay , led to a long period of dynastic strife . 
 Initially a pagan culture , detailed information about the return of the Christian religion to the islands of Scotland during the Norse @-@ era is elusive . The Orkneyinga Saga suggests the islands were Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway . The King summoned the jarl Sigurd the Stout and said , " I order you and all your subjects to be baptised . If you refuse , I 'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel . " Unsurprisingly , Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke , receiving their own bishop in the early 11th century . 
 Thorfinn the Mighty was a son of Sigurd and a grandson of King Máel Coluim mac Cináeda ( Malcolm II of Scotland ) . Along with Sigurd 's other sons he ruled Orkney during the first half of the 11th century and extended his authority over a small maritime empire stretching from Dublin to Shetland . Thorfinn died around 1065 and his sons Paul and Erlend succeeded him , fighting at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 . Paul and Erlend quarreled as adults and this dispute carried on to the next generation . The martyrdom of Magnus Erlendsson , who was killed in April 1116 by his cousin Haakon Paulsson , resulted in the building of St. Magnus Cathedral , still today a dominating feature of Kirkwall . 
 Unusually , from c . 1100 onwards the Norse jarls owed allegiance both to Norway for Orkney and to the Scottish crown through their holdings as Earls of Caithness . In 1231 the line of Norse earls , unbroken since Rognvald , ended with Jon Haraldsson 's murder in Thurso . The Earldom of Caithness was granted to Magnus , second son of the Earl of Angus , whom Haakon IV of Norway confirmed as Earl of Orkney in 1236 . In 1290 , the death of the child princess Margaret , Maid of Norway in Orkney , en route to mainland Scotland , created a disputed succession that led to the Wars of Scottish Independence . In 1379 the earldom passed to the Sinclair family , who were also barons of Roslin near Edinburgh . 
 Evidence of the Viking presence is widespread , and includes the settlement at the Brough of Birsay , the vast majority of place names , and the runic inscriptions at Maeshowe .

 In 1468 Orkney was pledged by Christian I , in his capacity as king of Norway , as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret , betrothed to James III of Scotland . As the money was never paid , the connection with the crown of Scotland has become perpetual . 
 The history of Orkney prior to this time is largely the history of the ruling aristocracy . From now on the ordinary people emerge with greater clarity . An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers , fishermen and merchants that called themselves <unk> Orcadie and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords . 
 From at least the 16th century , boats from mainland Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery . There is little evidence of an Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and then later Stromness becoming leading centres of development . White fish never became as dominant as in other Scottish ports . 
 In the 17th century , Orcadians formed the overwhelming majority of employees of the Hudson 's Bay Company in Canada . The harsh climate of Orkney and the Orcadian reputation for sobriety and their boat handling skills made them ideal candidates for the rigours of the Canadian north . During this period , burning kelp briefly became a mainstay of the islands ' economy . For example on Shapinsay over 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 048 t ) of burned seaweed were produced per annum to make soda ash , bringing in £ 20 @,@ 000 to the local economy . The industry collapsed suddenly in 1830 after the removal of tariffs on imported alkali . 
 Agricultural improvements beginning in the 17th century resulted in the enclosure of the commons and ultimately in the Victoria era the emergence of large and well @-@ managed farms using a five @-@ shift rotation system and producing high quality beef cattle . 
 In the 18th century Jacobite Risings Orkney was largely Jacobite in its sympathies . At the end of the 1715 rebellion , a large number of Jacobites who had fled north from mainland Scotland sought refuge on Orkney and were helped on to safety in Sweden . In 1745 , the Jacobite lairds on the islands ensured that Orkney remained pro @-@ Jacobite in outlook , and was a safe place to land supplies from Spain to aid their cause . Orkney was the last place in the British Isles that held out for the Jacobites and was not retaken by the British Government until 24 May 1746 , over a month after the defeat of the main Jacobite army at Culloden .

 Orkney was the site of a Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow , which played a major role in World War I and II . After the Armistice in 1918 , the German High Seas Fleet was transferred in its entirety to Scapa Flow to await a decision on its future . The German sailors opened the sea @-@ cocks and scuttled all the ships . Most ships were salvaged , but the remaining wrecks are now a favoured haunt of recreational divers . One month into World War II , a German U @-@ boat sank the Royal Navy battleship HMS Royal Oak in Scapa Flow . As a result , barriers were built to close most of the access channels ; these had the additional advantage of creating causeways enabling travellers to go from island to island by road instead of being obliged to rely on ferries . The causeways were constructed by Italian prisoners of war , who also constructed the ornate Italian Chapel . 
 During World War II , the politicians of German @-@ occupied Norway asked German authorities to take over Orkney as Norway sought new opportunities for expansion . 
 The navy base became run down after the war , eventually closing in 1957 . The problem of a declining population was significant in the post @-@ war years , though in the last decades of the 20th century there was a recovery and life in Orkney focused on growing prosperity and the emergence of a relatively classless society . Orkney was rated as the best place to live in Scotland in both 2013 and 2014 according to the Halifax Quality of Life survey . 
 = = = Overview of population trends = = = 
 In the modern era , population peaked in the mid 19th century at just over 26 @,@ 000 and declined for a century thereafter to a low of fewer than 17 @,@ 000 in the 1970s . Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands , some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses . Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere . The archipelago 's population grew by 11 % in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census . During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Orkney is separated from the mainland of Scotland by the Pentland Firth , a 10 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) wide seaway between Brough Ness on the island of South Ronaldsay and Duncansby Head in Caithness . Orkney lies between 58 ° 41 ′ and 59 ° 24 ′ North , and 2 ° 22 ′ and 3 ° 26 ′ West , measuring 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) from northeast to southwest and 47 kilometres ( 29 mi ) from east to west , and covers 975 square kilometres ( 376 sq mi ) . 
 The islands are mainly low @-@ lying except for some sharply rising sandstone hills on Hoy , Mainland and Rousay and rugged cliffs on some western coasts . Nearly all of the islands have lochs , but the watercourses are merely streams draining the high land . The coastlines are indented , and the islands themselves are divided from each other by straits generally called " sounds " or " firths " . 
 The tidal currents , or " roosts " as some of them are called locally , off many of the isles are swift , with frequent whirlpools . The islands are notable for the absence of trees , which is partly accounted for by the amount of wind . 
 = = Islands = = 
 = = = The Mainland = = = 
 The Mainland is the largest island of Orkney . Both of Orkney 's burghs , Kirkwall and Stromness , are on this island , which is also the heart of Orkney 's transportation system , with ferry and air connections to the other islands and to the outside world . The island is more densely populated ( 75 % of Orkney 's population ) than the other islands and has much fertile farmland . The Mainland is split into areas called East and West Mainland . These areas are determined by whether they lie East or West of Kirkwall . The bulk of the mainland lies West of Kirkwall , with comparatively little land lying East of Kirkwall . West Mainland parishes are : Stromness , <unk> , Birsay , Harray , Stenness , Orphir , Evie , Rendall and Firth . East Mainland Parishes are : St Ola , Tankerness , St Andrews , Holm and Deerness . 
 The island is mostly low @-@ lying ( especially East Mainland ) but with coastal cliffs to the north and west and two sizeable lochs : the Loch of Harray and the Loch of Stenness . The Mainland contains the remnants of numerous Neolithic , Pictish and Viking constructions . Four of the main Neolithic sites are included in the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site , inscribed in 1999 . 
 The other islands in the group are classified as north or south of the Mainland . Exceptions are the remote islets of Sule Skerry and Sule Stack , which lie 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) west of the archipelago , but form part of Orkney for local government purposes . In island names , the suffix " a " or " ay " represents the Norse ey , meaning " island " . Those described as " <unk> " are very small . 
 = = = The North Isles = = = 
 The northern group of islands is the most extensive and consists of a large number of moderately sized islands , linked to the Mainland by ferries and by air services . Farming , fishing and tourism are the main sources of income for most of the islands . 
 The most northerly is North Ronaldsay , which lies 4 kilometres ( 2 mi ) beyond its nearest neighbour , Sanday . To the west is Westray has a population of 550 . It is connected by ferry and air to Papa Westray , also known as " <unk> " . Eday is at the centre of the North Isles . The centre of the island is moorland and the island 's main industries have been peat extraction and limestone quarrying . 
 Rousay , Egilsay and <unk> lie north of the west Mainland across the Eynhallow Sound . Rousay is well known for its ancient monuments , including the Quoyness chambered cairn and Egilsay has the ruins of the only round @-@ towered church in Orkney . Wyre to the south east contains the site of Cubbie Roo 's castle . Stronsay and Papa Stronsay lie much further to the east across the Stronsay Firth . <unk> is south of Stronsay and has a population of only five . Shapinsay and its Balfour Castle are a short distance north of Kirkwall . 
 Other small uninhabited islands in the North Isles group include : Calf of Eday , <unk> , Eynhallow , Faray , Helliar Holm , Holm of Faray , Holm of <unk> , Holm of Papa , Holm of <unk> , Kili Holm , Linga Holm , Muckle Green Holm , Rusk Holm and Sweyn Holm . 
 = = = The South Isles = = = 
 The southern group of islands surrounds Scapa Flow . Hoy is the second largest of the Orkney Isles and Ward Hill at its northern end is the highest elevation in the archipelago . The Old Man of Hoy is a well @-@ known <unk> . Burray lies to the east of Scapa Flow and is linked by causeway to South Ronaldsay , which hosts the cultural events , the Festival of the Horse and the Boys ' Ploughing Match on the third Saturday in August . It is also the location of the Neolithic Tomb of the Eagles . Graemsay and Flotta are both linked by ferry to the Mainland and Hoy , and the latter is known for its large oil terminal . South Walls has a 19th @-@ century Martello tower and is connected to Hoy by the Ayre . South Ronaldsay , Burray , <unk> Holm , and Lamb Holm are connected by road to the Mainland by the Churchill Barriers . 
 Uninhabited South Islands include : Calf of Flotta , Cava , <unk> , Corn Holm , Fara , <unk> Holm , <unk> , Lamb Holm , <unk> Little , <unk> and Swona . The Pentland Skerries lie further south , closer to the Scottish mainland . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The superficial rock of Orkney is almost entirely Old Red Sandstone , mostly of Middle Devonian age . As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness , this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series , as may be seen on the Mainland , where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and <unk> , and again in the small island of Graemsay ; they are represented by grey gneiss and granite . 
 The Middle Devonian is divided into three main groups . The lower part of the sequence , mostly Eifelian in age , is dominated by lacustrine beds of the lower and upper Stromness Flagstones that were deposited in Lake Orcadie . The later Rousay flagstone formation is found throughout much of the North and South Isles and East Mainland . 
 The Old Man of Hoy is formed from sandstone of the uppermost Eday group that is up to 800 metres ( 870 yd ) thick in places . It lies unconformably upon steeply inclined flagstones , the interpretation of which is a matter of continuing debate . 
 The Devonian and older rocks of Orkney are cut by a series of WSW @-@ ENE to N @-@ S trending faults , many of which were active during deposition of the Devonian sequences . A strong synclinal fold traverses Eday and Shapinsay , the axis trending north @-@ south . 
 Middle Devonian basaltic volcanic rocks are found on western Hoy , on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay . Correlation between the Hoy volcanics and the other two exposures has been proposed , but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain . <unk> dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney . 
 Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands . Boulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Orkney has a cool temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude , due to the influence of the Gulf Stream . The average temperature for the year is 8 ° C ( 46 ° F ) ; for winter 4 ° C ( 39 ° F ) and for summer 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) . 
 The average annual rainfall varies from 850 millimetres ( 33 in ) to 940 millimetres ( 37 in ) . Winds are a key feature of the climate and even in summer there are almost constant breezes . In winter , there are frequent strong winds , with an average of 52 hours of gales being recorded annually . 
 To tourists , one of the fascinations of the islands is their " <unk> " summers . On the longest day , the sun rises at 03 : 00 and sets at 21 : 29 GMT and complete darkness is unknown . This long twilight is known in the Northern Isles as the " simmer dim " . Winter nights are long . On the shortest day the sun rises at 09 : 05 and sets at 15 : 16 . At this time of year the aurora borealis can occasionally be seen on the northern horizon during moderate auroral activity . 
 The averages table below is for largest settlement Kirkwall 's weather station . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Orkney is represented in the House of Commons as part of the Orkney and Shetland constituency , which elects one Member of Parliament ( MP ) , the current incumbent being Alistair Carmichael . This seat has been held by the Liberal Democrats or their predecessors the Liberal Party since 1950 , longer than any other they represent in Great Britain . 
 In the Scottish Parliament the Orkney constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament ( MSP ) by the first past the post system . The current MSP is Liam McArthur of the Liberal Democrats . Before McArthur the MSP was Jim Wallace , who was previously Deputy First Minister . Orkney is within the Highlands and Islands electoral region . 
 Orkney Islands Council consists of 21 members , all of whom are independent , that is they do not stand as representatives of a political party . 
 The Orkney Movement , a political party that supported devolution for Orkney from the rest of Scotland , contested the 1987 general election as the Orkney and Shetland Movement ( a coalition of the Orkney movement and its equivalent for Shetland ) . The Scottish National Party chose not to contest the seat to give the movement a " free run " . Their candidate , John Goodlad , came 4th with 3 @,@ 095 votes , 14 @.@ 5 % of those cast , but the experiment has not been repeated . 
 In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum 67 @.@ 2 % of voters in Orkney voted No to the question " Should Scotland be an independent country ? " This was the highest % No vote in any council area in Scotland . Turnout for the referendum was at 83 @.@ 7 % in Orkney with 10 @,@ 004 votes cast in the area against independence by comparison to 4 @,@ 883 votes for independence . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The soil of Orkney is generally very fertile and most of the land is taken up by farms , agriculture being by far the most important sector of the economy and providing employment for a quarter of the workforce . More than 90 % of agricultural land is used for grazing for sheep and cattle , with cereal production utilising about 4 % ( 4 @,@ 200 hectares ( 10 @,@ 000 acres ) ) and woodland occupying only 134 hectares ( 330 acres ) . 
 Fishing has declined in importance , but still employed 345 individuals in 2001 , about 3 @.@ 5 % of the islands ' economically active population , the modern industry concentrating on herring , white fish , lobsters , crabs and other shellfish , and salmon fish farming . 
 Today , the traditional sectors of the economy export beef , cheese , whisky , beer , fish and other seafood . In recent years there has been growth in other areas including tourism , food and beverage manufacture , jewellery , knitwear , and other crafts production , construction and oil transportation through the Flotta oil terminal . Retailing accounts for 17 @.@ 5 % of total employment , and public services also play a significant role , employing a third of the islands ' workforce . 
 In 2007 , of the 1 @,@ 420 VAT registered enterprises 55 % were in agriculture , forestry and fishing , 12 % in manufacturing and construction , 12 % in wholesale , retail and repairs , and 5 % in hotels and restaurants . A further 5 % were public service related . 55 % of these businesses employ between 5 and 49 people . 
 = = = Power = = = 
 Orkney has significant wind and marine energy resources , and renewable energy has recently come into prominence . Although Orkney is connected to the mainland , it generates over 100 % of its net power from renewables . This comes mainly from wind turbines situated right across Orkney . 
 The European Marine Energy Centre ( EMEC ) is a Scottish Government @-@ backed research facility that has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney Mainland and a tidal power testing station on the island of Eday . At the official opening of the Eday project the site was described as " the first of its kind in the world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose @-@ built performance testing facility . " Funding for the UK 's first wave farm was announced by the Scottish Government in 2007 . It will be the world 's largest , with a capacity of 3 MW generated by four Pelamis machines at a cost of over £ 4 million . During 2007 Scottish and Southern Energy plc in conjunction with the University of Strathclyde began the implementation of a Regional Power Zone in the Orkney archipelago . This scheme ( that may be the first of its kind in the world ) involves " active network management " that will make better use of existing infrastructure and allow a further <unk> of new " non @-@ firm generation " output from renewables onto the network .

 Highland and Islands Airports operates the main airport in Orkney , Kirkwall Airport . Loganair , a franchise of Flybe , provides services to the Scottish mainland ( Aberdeen , Edinburgh , Glasgow and Inverness ) , as well as to Sumburgh Airport in Shetland . 
 Within Orkney , the council operates airfields on most of the larger islands including Stronsay , Eday , North Ronaldsay , Westray , Papa Westray , and Sanday . The shortest scheduled air service in the world , between the islands of Westray and Papa Westray , is scheduled at two minutes duration but can take less than one minute if the wind is in the right direction .

 John o ' Groats to Burwick on South Ronaldsay ( seasonal passenger only service , operated by John o ' Groats Ferries ) 
 Lerwick to Kirkwall ( operated by NorthLink Ferries ) 
 Aberdeen to Kirkwall ( operated by NorthLink Ferries ) 
 Scrabster Harbour , Thurso to Stromness ( operated by NorthLink Ferries ) 
 Inter @-@ island ferry services connect all the inhabited islands to Orkney Mainland , and are operated by Orkney Ferries , a company owned by Orkney Islands Council .

 The islands are the home of several international festivals , including the Orkney International Science Festival in September , a folk festival in May and the St Magnus International Arts Festival in June .

 At the beginning of recorded history , the islands were inhabited by the Picts , whose language was Brythonic . The Ogham script on the Buckquoy spindle @-@ whorl is cited as evidence for the pre @-@ Norse existence of Old Irish in Orkney . 
 After the Norse occupation , the toponymy of Orkney became almost wholly West Norse . The Norse language changed into the local Norn , which lingered until the end of the 18th century , when it finally died out . Norn was replaced by the Orcadian dialect of Insular Scots . This dialect is at a low ebb due to the pervasive influences of television , education , and the large number of incomers . However , attempts are being made by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing @-@ song accent and many dialect words of Norse origin remain in use . The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is <unk> , meaning small , which may be derived from the French petit . 
 Orkney has a rich folklore , and many of the former tales concern trows , an Orcadian form of troll that draws on the islands ' Scandinavian connections . Local customs in the past included marriage ceremonies at the Odin Stone that formed part of the Stones of Stenness . 
 King Lot in certain versions of the Arthurian legend ( e.g. , Malory ) is ruler of Orkney . His sons <unk> , <unk> , Gareth , and <unk> are major characters in the Matter of Britain . 
 The best known literary figures from modern Orkney are the poet Edwin Muir , the poet and novelist George Mackay Brown , and the novelist Eric Linklater . 
 = = Orcadians = = 
 An Orcadian is a native of Orkney , a term that reflects a strongly held identity with a tradition of understatement . Although the annexation of the earldom by Scotland took place over five centuries ago in 1472 , most Orcadians regard themselves as Orcadians first and Scots second . 
 When an Orcadian speaks of " Scotland " , they are talking about the land to the immediate south of the Pentland Firth . When an Orcadian speaks of " the mainland " , they mean Mainland , Orkney . Tartan , clans , bagpipes and the like are traditions of the Scottish Highlands and are not a part of the islands ' indigenous culture . However , at least two tartans with Orkney connections have been registered and a tartan has been designed for Sanday by one of the island 's residents , and there are pipe bands in Orkney . 
 Native Orcadians refer to the non @-@ native residents of the islands as " ferry <unk> " , a term that has been in use for nearly two centuries at least . 
 = = Natural history = = 
 Orkney has an abundance of wildlife , especially of grey and common seals and seabirds such as puffins , kittiwakes , tysties , ravens , and bonxies . Whales , dolphins , and otters are also seen around the coasts . Inland the Orkney vole , a distinct subspecies of the common vole introduced by Neolithic humans , is an endemic . There are five distinct varieties , found on the islands of Sanday , Westray , Rousay , South Ronaldsay , and the Mainland , all the more remarkable as the species is absent on mainland Britain . 
 The coastline is well known for its colourful flowers including sea aster , sea squill , sea thrift , common sea @-@ lavender , bell and common heather . The Scottish primrose is found only on the coasts of Orkney and nearby Caithness and Sutherland . Although stands of trees are generally rare , a small forest named Happy Valley with 700 trees and lush gardens was created from a boggy hillside near Stenness during the second half of the 20th century . 
 The North Ronaldsay sheep is an unusual breed of domesticated animal , subsisting largely on a diet of seaweed , since they are confined to the foreshore for most of the year to conserve the limited grazing inland . The island was also a habitat for the Atlantic walrus until the mid @-@ 16th century . 
 The Orkney char ( Salvelinus <unk> ) used to live in <unk> Water on Hoy . It has been considered locally extinct since 1908 . 
 The introduction of alien stoats just prior to 2015 , a natural predator of the common vole and thus of the Orkney vole , may be harming native bird populations .

 Guilty Gear X ( Japanese : ギルティギア ゼクス , Hepburn : Giruti Gia Zekusu ) , subtitled By Your Side in Japan , is a fighting game developed by Arc System Works and published by Sammy Studios . The second installment of the Guilty Gear series , Guilty Gear X was developed over a period of about two years after the first game 's success . It was released in July 2000 for Japanese arcades , re @-@ released on Dreamcast in December 2000 , and later ported to PlayStation 2 in November 2001 and Game Boy Advance in January 2002 . 
 Guilty Gear X continues its predecessor 's timeline with new characters and gameplay features .

 The fight system has a four @-@ main @-@ attack @-@ button configuration : punch , kick , slash and heavy slash . Players may also launch taunt attacks , with their main objective to reduce the opponent 's health to zero in a predetermined time . To win a fight a player must accumulate two points , with each round won earning a point . Guilty Gear X has features common in fighting games : combos , aerial attacks and counterattacks . A new feature is the Roman Cancel , which allows a player to cancel their move and its aftereffects to make other attacks . 
 The game has a tension gauge , increasing when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is stopped for a long time . When the gauge is half @-@ charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks , which cause more damage than regular moves . A full gauge allows a player to make an Instant Kill , defeating an opponent regardless of health ; if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful , the tension gauge will not charge for the remainder of that round . 
 Guilty Gear X 's Dreamcast version includes four modes of play : Arcade , the game 's primary narrative mode ; Survival , in which the player fights through infinite levels until they are defeated ; Training , which allows a player to practice moves with the help of an in @-@ game move list and Versus , in which a player can fight another player . Guilty Gear X Plus also has art @-@ gallery and story modes ; according to the Sega website , the latter explains " <unk> " which the Dreamcast version does not .

 After the success of the first Guilty Gear released on May 14 , 1998 for PlayStation , Sammy Studios commissioned an arcade sequel in February 1999 . Developed by Team Neo Blood , an Arc System Works production group led by Daisuke Ishiwatari , the sequel was about two years in development . Unveiled at the Amusement Expo in February 2000 , Guilty Gear X was released for Japanese arcades on the Sega NAOMI system in July 2000 . After the game 's release , it was speculated that it would be ported to home consoles . Although the developers initially indicated that Guilty Gear X would debut for the PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) , it was first released for Dreamcast on December 14 , 2000 and re @-@ released as part of a Dreamcast collection on May 23 , 2003 . 
 A PS2 version was announced by Sammy in June 2001 for release that fall , and Guilty Gear X was released in North America on October 2 , 2001 . Since it was released before the Japanese version , the North American edition did not have the additional features of the Japanese counterpart . Sammy released the PS2 version in Japan on November 29 , 2001 and in Europe on March 1 , 2002 . In Japan , it was known as Guilty Gear X Plus ( ギルティギア ゼクス Plus , Giruti Gia Zekusu <unk> ) and was released in two versions : regular and deluxe , with the latter containing Guilty Gear @-@ related special products . On February 13 , 2003 , the game was re @-@ released in Japan as part of PlayStation2 the Best . 
 CyberFront released a PC version for Windows on November 30 , 2001 in Japan .

 In June 2001 , Sammy reported a profit of ¥ 284 million for Guilty Gear X 's Japanese arcade version . Its Dreamcast version was the 128th @-@ bestselling title in Japan in 2000 , with 97 @,@ 934 copies sold from December 14 to December 31 . In 2001 the game sold 33 @,@ 822 more copies , for a total of 131 @,@ 756 . Guilty Gear X Plus sold over 128 @,@ 000 copies in Japan . 
 Critical reception for Guilty Gear X on Dreamcast and PS2 was positive ; they have average scores of 89 @.@ 33 percent and 79 @.@ 70 percent , respectively , on GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PS2 version 79 out of 100 . Anoop Gantayat of IGN called the Dreamcast version " possibly the finest @-@ looking 2D game ever , thanks to the high @-@ res graphics , mega @-@ ultra special effects and smooth animation . " According to T.J. <unk> of AllGame , the PS2 is " notable for smooth , refined graphics , with richly detailed characters and backgrounds uncommon in 2D fighters . " Although Guilty Gear X 's overall graphics were praised , its sometimes @-@ confusing backgrounds were heavily criticized . 
 The Dreamcast version 's control responsiveness was praised by Gantayat . Guilty Gear X 's PS2 version was also generally praised , with Greg Kasavin of GameSpot writing that it " controls smoothly and precisely " . Major Mike of GamePro included the caveat that " some moves are difficult to execute and require patience to master fully . " According to James Fudge for GameSpy , " The gameplay manages to be easy to pick up but isn 't dumbed down enough to annoy expert fight fans . " Guilty Gear X 's limited replay value was heavily criticised ; Jay <unk> of Game Informer said , " Since it 's especially weak in the singles game , consider purchasing Guilty Gear X only if you and a friend want to go at it . " 
 The Game Boy Advance version was less well received , with aggregate scores of 64 @.@ 97 percent and 67 out of 100 from GameRankings and Metacritic respectively . A common criticism was that the game 's artificial intelligence was inefficient in combat , making it too easy . Although Chet of Game Informer said , " The new modes such as Tag Match and 3 @-@ on @-@ 3 add variety , but still cannot compensate for this fundamental problem " , according to Michael Knutson of GameZone its balance " gives the game a better replay value . " 
 GamesRadar criticized Guilty Gear X 's " overblown aesthetics " , giving it the game 's worst score ( three out of ten ) : " While it 's not completely hellish , it definitely deserves purgatory . " According to Star Dingo of GamePro , " Most backgrounds seem like pale , watercolor imitations of the originals ( you can count the colors on two hands ) " . Justin of Game Informer and Kaiser Hwang of IGN criticized the game 's sprites , which they considered small compared with those of Street Fighter . 
 Its characters were praised as " original " by Justin and " cool " by Kasavin . Gantayat wrote , " It 's the characters that stand out the most " , calling them " marvelously designed , " " unmatched in terms of fine details " and " very distinct . " According to Fudge , " There 's a character of choice for just about everyone . " The characters ' balance was praised by Tom Bramwell and Knutson . Guilty Gear X 's audio had a lukewarm response ; according to Chet and Hwang it was " weak " , and Dingo called it " atrocious " . Mike and Kasavin found the fight announcer 's voice " unintelligible " , with Mike also criticizing the game 's " oppressive " music . Knutson praised Guilty Gear X 's sound effects and music , and Kasavin considered its music appropriate for " the game 's fast @-@ paced action , as well as its anime theme . "

 Guilty Gear X 's musical albums were published by First Smile Entertainment . Its arcade music was released on September 20 , 2000 as Guilty Gear X Original Soundtrack ( ギルティギア ゼクス オリジナルサウンドトラック , Giruti Gia Zekusu Orijinaru Saundotorakku ) , composed by Daisuke Ishiwatari and arranged by Kazuhito <unk> and Yasuharu Takanashi . The album received mixed reviews . Don Kotowski of Square Enix Music Online gave it an eight out of ten : " The improved sound quality is a plus , as are the addition of new character themes , but some people may be put off by the fact that some of the new themes aren 't as good as some of the older ones . " Another reviewer , GoldfishX , gave it a five , calling it " possibly the most ear @-@ grating , hideous sound I have ever encountered in game music " but not giving it a worse score because " Ishiwatari deserves a ton of credit for putting together such brilliant compositions on such pathetic @-@ sounding hardware . " 
 A second album , Guilty Gear X Heavy Rock Tracks : The Original Soundtrack of Dreamcast , composed by Ishiwatari and arranged by Koichi Seiyama , was released on January 17 , 2001 . It was well received by critics , with perfect scores from GoldfishX and Z @-@ Freak of Square Enix Music Online . According to <unk> , " Even if you 're skeptical about hard rock , this is something that everyone should experience in their lifetime . It 's rare to have this type of heart @-@ pounding sound without some form of vocals , but it 's even rarer that the compositions reach this overall level of greatness . " Z @-@ Freak wrote , " Unless you totally hate hard rock , you MUST [ sic ] have this CD " and David Smith of IGN said that its music would either be loved or hated . 
 Three albums by the rock band Lapis Lazuli were released on May 6 , 2001 . Known collectively as Rising Force of Gear Image Vocal Tracks , the individual albums were entitled " Rock You ! ! " , " Slash ! ! " , and " Destroy ! ! "

 The second season of Supernatural , an American paranormal drama television series created by Eric Kripke , premiered on September 28 , 2006 , and concluded on May 17 , 2007 , airing 22 episodes . The season focuses on protagonists Sam ( Jared Padalecki ) and Dean Winchester ( Jensen Ackles ) as they track down Azazel , the demon responsible for the deaths of their mother Mary and father John . They attempt to discover the demon 's plan for Sam and other psychic children — young adults who were visited by Azazel as infants and given abilities , and whose mothers often then died in a fire . During their travels , they use their father 's journal to help them carry on the family business — saving people and hunting supernatural creatures . 
 The season aired on Thursdays at 9 : 00 pm ET in the United States , and was the first season to air on The CW television network , a joint venture of The WB and UPN . The previous season was broadcast on The WB . It averaged only about 3 @.@ 14 million American viewers , and was in danger of not being renewed . The cast and crew garnered many award nominations , but the episodes received mixed reviews from critics . While both the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors and the decision to finish the main storyline were praised , the formulaic structure of the episodes was criticized . 
 The season was internationally syndicated , airing in the United Kingdom on ITV , in Canada on Citytv and SPACE , and in Australia on Network Ten . It was released on DVD as a six @-@ disc box set September 11 , 2007 , by Warner Home Video in Region 1 . Although the season was split into two separate releases in Region 2 , the complete set was released October 29 , 2007 , and in Region 4 October 3 , 2007 . The episodes are also available through digital retailers such as Apple 's iTunes Store , Microsoft 's Xbox Live Marketplace , and Amazon.com 's on @-@ demand TV service .

 The writers used the second season to expand upon the concept of hunters , resulting in the introduction of many recurring characters through the hunter @-@ frequented saloon — Harvelle 's Roadhouse . Samantha Ferris portrayed Ellen Harvelle , proprietor of the Roadhouse and an old friend of John Winchester , while Alona Tal played Ellen 's daughter Jo . This pair complemented the father @-@ son relationship of the Winchesters in the first year . Ferris believes she was exactly what the producers were looking for : a " tough , strong , yet a little maternal actor " . Tal 's character , on the other hand , was an intended love interest for Dean , and was eventually phased out because she came off as more of a sister figure . Chad Lindberg portrayed the genius Ash , who uses his vast computer skills to track the paranormal . Because the writers felt the character 's " comical " and " wacky " personality was too unrealistic for the show , he was also removed by the finale . 
 Other characters returned from the first year . Actor Jim Beaver made multiple appearances as hunter Bobby Singer , an old family friend of the Winchesters . Beaver had expected his first @-@ season guest appearance in " Devil 's Trap " to be a " one @-@ shot deal " , and was surprised when he was asked to return . Adrianne Palicki reprised her role as Sam 's deceased girlfriend Jessica in the alternate @-@ reality episode " What Is and What Should Never Be " , as did Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester . Smith also made an appearance in a flashback in the penultimate episode , " All Hell Breaks Loose , Part One " . And though at first reluctant because of his role on Grey 's Anatomy , Jeffrey Dean Morgan returned as John Winchester in the season premiere and finale . However , the character dies in the premiere because the writers worried that having him separated from his sons again — Sam and Dean spend much of the first season tracking him down — would " split the show " by having him away " doing more interesting things than the boys are doing " . As a demon , the villain Azazel periodically switches hosts , and was first fully portrayed by Morgan in the first @-@ season finale . The reins passed to Fredric Lehne for the second @-@ season premiere , and the show 's producers enjoyed his performance so much they brought him back for the two @-@ part finale . 
 Many factors went into the casting decisions of the season 's guest stars . Linda Blair , famous for her role in the horror film The Exorcist , appeared in the episode " The Usual Suspects " . Though a fan of the show , Blair had turned down a guest appearance in the first season because she did not want to return to horror , having spent years getting a " clean slate " . This changed after the television series Extra aired a three @-@ part profile on her acting career and work with animals . It attempted to find a series that would write a role for her as " an actor 's piece " , rather than a cameo . Kripke , a fan of The Exorcist , offered to write an episode specifically for her , and she was " really touched " when he listened to her request to leave out demons in the storyline . During automated dialogue replacement , Jensen Ackles added in a reference to The Exorcist with the statement , " I could really go for some pea soup . " 
 The casting of Battlestar Galactica 's Tricia Helfer in " Roadkill " stemmed from the producers ' preference to hire actors important to Supernatural 's fanbase . This was the first episode to have the Winchesters as supporting characters , and Kripke felt " Tricia had the charisma to perform the leading role " . Kripke enjoyed Emmanuelle Vaugier 's work in television series such as Smallville , and believed she was an " easy choice " for the large role of the soon @-@ to @-@ be werewolf Madison in " Heart " . Director Kim Manners felt Vaugier brought to the character a vulnerability like that of Lon Chaney , Jr. in The Wolf Man , which made viewers sympathetic . Conspiracy @-@ theorist Ronald of " <unk> " was envisioned by writer and consulting producer Ben Edlund as the unsympathetic " semi @-@ drunk Randy Quaid from Independence Day " . However , this changed with Chris Gauthier 's casting , and Edlund felt that Ronald turned out to be a " really cool " character fans would enjoy . The producers considered Summer Glau for the role of the zombie Angela for " Children Shouldn 't Play with Dead Things " , but she could not accept due to scheduling conflicts . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 When production of the second season started , Kripke wanted to avoid the monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week formula used in the first year . The writers attempted this by including more " human themes , " mainly " the things Sam and Dean are truly afraid of : death , grief , betrayal , etc . " This change brought the series ' focus onto situations such as the brothers dealing with their father 's death and giving them the task of hunting down Azazel , the demon who killed him . Morgan feels that the brothers ' " inner turmoil " created by the death of his character made them more three @-@ dimensional . While Dean has trouble dealing with his father 's death , Kripke wishes they had focused more on Sam 's reaction . Instead , the episodes dealt more with Sam 's fear of becoming evil , which Kripke regretted since the writers never depicted the character committing malevolent acts . Another main storyline of the season followed Sam and Dean as they track down the various psychic children — young adults like Sam who were visited by Azazel as infants and given abilities . However , the psychic children storyline made the mythology of the second season " dense " and " confusing " for Kripke . 
 Kripke instead favored the " unique and structurally interesting " self @-@ enclosed episodes , which sometimes arose from the writers ' unused ideas . From the series ' beginning , Kripke desired to feature an evil clown because he felt that " clowns in a context where they 're not supposed to be are friggin ' terrifying " . To fit with the series , the clown became a shapeshifting Rakshasa of Hindu mythology . This decision made the clown " less satisfying " , to Kripke 's chagrin , because it limited the clown @-@ related scenes . Another element of folklore favored by Kripke was the story of Robert Johnson , which he focused on in his first screenplay as a writer . He found the legend similar to Supernatural , noting , " It 's a piece of real life American history and folklore , it 's an American horror story , it takes place on the dusty back roads of rural America , and it 's got great music . " However , the lore takes place in the early 20th century , and prevented the inclusion of Sam and Dean . To circumvent this , writer Sera Gamble suggested Johnson 's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks , with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more deals . Although Gamble envisioned the demon 's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a Rottweiler , Kripke felt it would " look stupid " . The creature was instead made invisible , which Gamble believes gave it a more terrifying presence . 
 Before he entered the television industry , writer and consulting producer Ben Edlund had wanted to pen a metafictional script dealing with television production , but decided against it because he did not have production knowledge . He later returned to it for the episode " Hollywood Babylon " . Edlund decided to have the production staff look like " goofballs " , and made fun of Supernatural 's production staff , the network , and the studio . For example , comments made by Gary Cole 's " studio suit " character were based on notes from the network and studio for Supernatural during both seasons of production . Other metafictional references include a character commenting on the " terrible script " of Boogeyman , a film written by Kripke ; Sam becoming uncomfortable as the studio tour passes the set of Gilmore Girls , a television series in which Padalecki had a recurring role ; and Sam proclaiming Hollywood 's weather to be " positively Canadian " . 
 Other stories were developed from simple concepts . For example , the reformed @-@ vampire episode " Bloodlust " was developed to suggest that all monsters should not be killed indiscriminately . The plot alluded to " racial issues " , but not blatantly ; rather , as Padalecki noted , they explored it in a " fun way " . The episode " The Usual Suspects " emerged from the writers ' desire to keep the audience guessing . Cathryn Humphris pitched a story with a ghost serving as a death omen — warning people of future tragedy , rather than trying to kill them , unlike previous ghosts on the series . However , Humphris had trouble developing the script 's outline . Kripke noted a part of the episode in which brothers are arrested and have to explain to police what had happened ; this scenario ultimately became the framework of the episode , which begins with Sam and Dean being taken into custody . The concept for " Tall Tales " originated as a " he said , he said " episode , in which the brothers would recount conflicting versions of the same storyline . The writers deliberated over the use of five or six monsters in trying to find one appropriate for the episode , but eventually settled on a trickster because it " can do everything [ they ] want it to " . Although the writers typically prefer to put their own spin on folklore , they decided in this case to remain faithful to the archetypal trickster mythos . Because the season alluded to the possibility of Sam becoming bad , the writers wanted to portray how an evil Sam would behave and what Dean 's reaction would be . One of the writers ' first creative ideas of the season was depicted in the teaser of " Born Under a Bad Sign " , in which a blood @-@ covered Sam wakes up not remembering the past week of his life . The plot , which " fell into place " during the writing process , included demonic possession to explain Sam 's actions — an event that resulted in the return of the vengeful Meg Masters demon . 
 After the plotlines were developed , major deviations sometimes occurred in the writing process . Like in the final version of the script , twins with mind @-@ control abilities were the focus of Edlund 's original pitch for the episode " Simon Said " . However , the more powerful twin — kept secluded due to deformities — forced his brother to perceive himself as retarded . At the end of the episode , his brother ate him in retaliation . The story was eventually changed , and instead focused on questions such as " What do you do with power ? " . Kripke felt that this fit greatly with the series ' storyline , because Sam was uncomfortable with his developing abilities ; the writers wanted to explore one of the psychic children who took his ability as a gift . " Folsom Prison Blues " stemmed from Kripke 's desire to feature prison ghosts , and the initial plot had FBI Agent Henriksen finally capturing the brothers and sending them to prison . However , this caused a major complication : the writers would have to devise a way for Sam and Dean to escape in the end . Writer John Shiban suggested that the brothers be arrested on purpose in order to work a job , with the prison 's head guard being revealed as a family friend . 
 The two @-@ part finale " All Hell Breaks Loose " brought many storylines to a close . The psychic children were killed off because the writers felt the characters were not as interesting as demons and monsters . The Roadhouse was destroyed due to Kripke 's disliking of the concept ; he felt it gave a home to the road show . Fearing that he would disappoint fans by creating too much anticipation , Kripke also decided to answer many questions regarding Azazel 's plans in " Part One " . The second part ended the brothers ' quest to kill Azazel , but also opened more storylines for the third season , such as Dean 's demonic pact to resurrect Sam and the question of whether what returned was " one hundred percent pure Sam " . Additionally , the " war of demons against humanity " — hinted at throughout the first two seasons — finally started at the finale 's end . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography took place in Vancouver , British Columbia . The crew used two cameras simultaneously for each scene , which allowed for two different angles to be filmed of the same sequence . The series usually has a dark atmosphere , though production purposefully created a contrasting appearance for certain episodes . " Hollywood Babylon " details the filming of a fake horror movie , and the use of two filming styles helped make a distinction ; scenes of the fake film used more saturated colors , while scenes for the actual episode were " down to reality " . To depict the perfect world of " What Is and What Should Never Be " , the usual shadows and " moody lighting " more made colorful and warm . 
 Problems during production sometimes arose . For his scenes as the yellow @-@ eyed demon Azazel throughout the season , Fredric Lehne wore hard , colored contact lenses that greatly obscured his vision . The production crew placed sandbags on the floor to help him locate his marks . Lindsey McKeon , who portrayed a Reaper briefly possessed by Azazel in " In My Time of Dying " , also experienced the same problem . Her scene — she touches Ackles ' forehead — took nine takes to film because she kept missing . Filming for " What Is and What Should Never Be " was interrupted in order to accommodate the busy Adrianne Palicki . Production shifted to the following episode after five days of filming , and resumed when Palicki became available for the final three days . 
 Because the series uses few standing sets , set designer Jerry Wanek often had to construct entirely new sets for each episode . Outside elements had an influence on some designs , with the bar in the hotel of " Playthings " being an homage to The Shining . A Wisconsin native , Wanek was able to incorporate personal items into the motel set for the Wisconsin @-@ based episode " Nightshifter " ; because polka is part of the state 's culture , he used posters from his father 's old polka band , as well as photos of his nephews and Wisconsin landmarks . Due to " Tall Tales " ' s atmosphere , that episode 's motel was designed to be " over the top " . Wanek noted , " They were in this really odd @-@ looking motel that had crystal chandeliers and carved beds , turquoise stove and refrigerator , and this wonderful period linoleum on the floor . I thought it really matched the tempo and emotion of the show . " At times , however , Wanek was able to reuse old sets . The loft set from " No Exit " was redesigned into an apartment for " Crossroad Blues " , and the bar in " Born Under a Bad Sign " was a refurbished Roadhouse set . 
 Not all scenes could take place in the studio , and some were instead shot on location . The vault scenes in " Nightshifter " were filmed in an actual bank safe , as production would not have been able to construct one on set . Outside shots were filmed in downtown Vancouver , forcing streets to be closed off . The crypt of " Houses of the Holy " was built underneath St. Andrew 's @-@ Wesley United Church , with plastic used to imitate sculpted stone . Riverview Hospital — used as a filming location in previous episodes — was used for the premiere " In My Time of Dying " . It also functioned as a jail in " Folsom Prison Blues " due to , as Wanek describes , " the texture on the walls , the lack of any humanity in the design , and the materials used to build it ... " However , the prison block was built on a sound stage . The final scenes of " Simon Said " were filmed at Cleveland Dam , and " All Hell Breaks Loose , Part One " made use of a pre @-@ existing set built for the Western television series Bordertown . The climax of " Part Two " was originally to take place in an actual cemetery , but numerous issues forced production to film the scene in the studio . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The mostly synthesized orchestral score of the season was composed by Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska . The pair try to base the music on the visuals of each episode , with about a third of each episode 's score being newly written for the supernatural legend . For example , when the werewolf 's point of view is depicted in " Heart " , Gruska tried to make the score predatorial . For " Roadkill " ' s emotional ending , Lennertz used cello and piano to " [ tug ] at the heart strings " and " push the tears " . The music was supposed to " become part of the sinister wallpaper " in " In My Time of Dying " . Thus , in the scene involving John Winchester selling his soul to Azazel , Gruska wrote the music as " dark and dank " , but feels the viewer would only notice the music if it was removed from the scene . 
 Other musical elements were based on aspects of the episode , and often used less conventional instruments . For " Simon Said " — featuring characters with the ability of mind @-@ control — Gruska tried to make the score more " mind @-@ trippy " , opting to mainly use " synthy , spacey electronica pads " to give it a science @-@ fiction sound . Toy @-@ piano sounds were included in " Playthings " by Gruska to make the score more childlike . Because of the Robert Johnson theme of " Crossroad Blues " , Lennertz made sure to be specific to Johnson 's style when writing the music for the opening scene . A blues guitarist was brought in , and played on a " beat @-@ up old acoustic guitar " . However , they added in dissonant notes to foreshadow the " grittiness to come " . Lennertz used organ , drums , bass , and guitar to have a " retro bluesy approach " for " Folsom Prison Blues " , mimicking the style of film composer David Holmes . Likewise , he wanted the episode " Nightshifter " to have a " feature film feel " , with the score ending up similar to The Bourne Identity . With Linda Blair of The Exorcist guest starring in " The Usual Suspects " , Gruska used tubular bells as an homage to the film 's score . 
 In addition to the score , the series makes use of rock songs , with most being selected from Kripke 's private collection . Among the many bands featured in the second season are AC / DC , Lynyrd Skynyrd , and Boston . Rock songs are also usually featured in " The Road So Far " montages at the beginning of select episodes that recap previous events . The premiere used Ted Nugent 's " Stranglehold " , and a " coming soon " sequence midway through the season was set to Nazareth 's " Hair of the Dog " . The finale recapped the entire season to Kansas ' " Carry On Wayward Son " . The second season also began the tradition of naming many episodes after classic rock songs , with Kripke preferring Led Zeppelin songs . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 The series makes use of visual , special , and make @-@ up effects , as well as stuntwork . Beginning with the second season , visual effects became an in @-@ house department . Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden feels this improved the series because a fixed budget allowed them to compensate for other scenes that lacked effects , such as in " Nightshifter " . Wide shots of the bank 's exterior — featuring closed @-@ off streets , police , and SWAT helicopters — were accomplished with visual effects . The series ' catchphrase — " Scary just got sexy " — was added to a billboard in the background . For the episode " Houses of the Holy " , production did not want viewers to be able to determine that the " angel " was in actuality a priest . Thus , the shape engulfed in light was a girl wearing a skintight white leotard . At times , the visual effects used were subtle . Cockroaches were digitally inserted into the sewer scenes of " No Exit " ; director Kim Manners did not ask for it , but thought the addition " made it really creepy " . The episode " Playthings " featured a scene of a man dying after falling down stairs . The department added blood flowing from underneath him , and also made his fingers twitch and his mouth open and close to create a more lifelike appearance . 
 The special effects and makeup departments are also important assets to production . Dean has an out @-@ of @-@ body experience in " In My Time of Dying " , and some scenes feature him looking at his own body in a hospital bed . To forgo the use of visual effects , the special effects department sculpted a full gelatin face from Ackles , and applied it to a body double . To depict a woman burning to death in the episode " Simon Said " , the actress was sealed inside a full body silicone designed to look like her , and was doused with fire accelerant . She was required to breathe through a straw , as well as don underwear soaked in ice @-@ cold fire @-@ retardant gel . Prior to " Heart " , Kripke had not wanted to include werewolves in the series , as he felt that the budget would only allow for " a guy with fur glued to his face " . As he prefers to have monsters be able to walk among humans , production made the transformation subtle — the character 's eyes change , and her canine teeth and fingernails grow . However , writer Sera Gamble believes that they " dropped the ball " in the design , feeling that the creature looked too similar to a vampire .

 Supernatural had low ratings during its second season . Viewers consisted mainly of teenage girls , with the CW trying to attract more males . It ranked No. 216 relative to the position of other prime time network shows . With an average viewership of 3 @.@ 14 million Americans , the show 's future was in doubt at the season 's end . Despite this , the series was renewed for a third season . According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 Supernatural convention , the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series . 
 The second season of the series received mixed reviews from critics . The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100 % approval rating with an average rating of 8 @.@ 2 / 10 based on 5 reviews . Jim Kaz of IGN gave the season a similar score at 8 / 10 . While at first hesitant of the series , believing it to be " another horror / sci @-@ fi / occult hybrid currently igniting ratings " , he found the " eerie and intricate storylines " to overcome the " initial impressions of Clearasil ads and Paris Hilton in House of Wax " . Praising the cliffhangers and the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors , Kaz deemed Supernatural " one @-@ helluva edge @-@ of @-@ your @-@ seat , ball @-@ burner of a series with a forceful script , excellent acting ( said pretty boys included ) and some fine special effects " . Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune thoroughly enjoyed the season , and " really , really liked " the Roadhouse . Not understanding why the Roadhouse was not used more throughout the season , she was " pretty annoyed " when it was destroyed . Ryan also favored the new hunter characters , especially Ash , and was " not thrilled " when Ash was killed . Regarding Sam and Dean , she noted the series ' " ability to hone in on [ sic ] the brotherly conflicts and emotions threaded through a well @-@ plotted monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week story " . While she enjoyed Tricia Helfer 's guest appearance , she did not enjoy the stunt casting of Linda Blair and would have preferred a " more skilled actress " . The season received a grade of a B- from Brian Tallerico of UGO , who found it " frustrating " due to the use of the " same predictable formula " that did not meet the standards of the first season . Other problems he found included " the brothers [ turning ] whiny and mopey and [ taking ] everything too seriously " . However , he believed that the season ended " strong " — he liked how the main storyline was wrapped up , opening new storylines — and noted that there were some " excellent " episodes . Tallerico praised the " tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek Winchester adventure " " The Usual Suspects " , feeling that it had " enough pop culture references to make Tarantino jealous " and the " pitch @-@ perfect mix of tones that make the show so great " . He also found " Nightshifter " to be the " best action hour of Supernatural 's second year " , deeming it " riveting from beginning to end " . Also applauding the season 's cliffhanger was Peter Brown of <unk> , who gave the season a B + . He enjoyed the expansion of the series ' mythology , as well as the new characters introduced .

 = Emotions ( Mariah Carey album ) = 
 Emotions is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey . It was released on September 17 , 1991 by Columbia Records . The album deviated from the formula of Carey 's 1990 self @-@ titled debut album , as she had more creative control over the material she produced and recorded . Additionally , Emotions features influences from a range of genres such as gospel , R & B , soul , pop and 1950s , 1960s and 1970s balladry infusion . On the record , Carey worked with a variety of producers and writers , including Walter Afanasieff , the only hold over from her previous effort . Additionally , Carey wrote and produced the album 's material with Robert Clivillés and David Cole from C + C Music Factory and Carole King , with whom she wrote one song . 
 Upon release , Emotions received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics . The album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 , surprising many critics following the success of Carey 's debut , which spent eleven weeks atop the chart . While selling far less than Mariah Carey , Emotions was eventually certified quadruple @-@ platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , denoting shipments of four million copies throughout the country , with estimated sales standing at 3 @,@ 595 @,@ 000 copies . Emotions achieved moderate success outside the United States , peaking within the top ten in Australia , Canada , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway and the United Kingdom . Its success in Japan was strong , shipping one million copies there . The album has sold 8 million copies worldwide . 
 Three commercial singles were released from the album . The title track , the album 's lead song , became Carey 's fifth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100 , making her the only artist in history to have their first five singles reach the chart 's summit . Additionally , it became Carey 's third chart topper in Canada , and reached the top ten in France , the Netherlands and New Zealand . " Can 't Let Go " was released as the second single from Emotions on October 23 , 1991 . Due to Columbia 's removal of the single from stores in an attempt to boost the album 's sales , " Can 't Let Go " failed to become her sixth chart topper in the US , peaking at number two . European and worldwide success was very limited , reaching the top 20 in only Canada and the UK . Similarly , " Make It Happen " peaked at number five in the US , and achieved relatively weak international charting , prompting Columbia to halt promotion of the album .

 Following the success of Carey 's self @-@ titled debut album , critics wondered whether or not she would tour in order to promote the album in the major worldwide music markets . However , Carey expressed in several interviews that due to the strenuous nature and the sheer difficulty of her songs , she feared a tour with back @-@ to @-@ back shows would not be possible , aside from the long travel times and constant travel . With the extra time , Carey began writing and producing material for Emotions around the same time that her debut 's third single , " Someday " , was released in December 1990 . During this time period in music , it was traditional for an artist to release a studio album every two years in their prime , allowing the singles to fully promote the album through airwaves , as well as television appearances . Additionally , after a tour that would usually follow , as the next album would be released and would gain new fans , they would search the artist 's catalog , and purchase the previous album in hopes of learning of their older work . Sony , however , chose to market Carey in a different fashion , leaning towards the traditional form in the 1960s , where acts would release an LP every year . They felt that Carey 's reputation of being a " studio worm " and a songwriter from a young age would be captivating enough to deliver a new album more often than most . 
 As writing for the album came under way , Carey had a falling out with Ben Margulies , the man whom Carey had written seven of the eleven songs on Carey 's debut with . Together , the duo had written and produced seven songs for Carey 's demo tape which she handed to Tommy Mottola . Their parting of ways was due to a contract Carey had signed prior to her signing with Columbia . Carey had agreed to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs , but half of her earnings as well , something she never thought twice about while writing songs in his father 's basement . However , when the time came to write music for Emotions , Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co @-@ writers on an album . Following the discussion , Margulies filed a lawsuit against Sony , claiming that under contract , he would be entitled to work with Carey , as well as reap extra benefits . After an almost one year lawsuit , the judge settled that Margulies was to earn ten percent of Carey 's direct earnings from her record sales , not including an income from any other ventures . While settled , their relationship remained ruined , damaged by what Carey considered treachery . In an interview with Fred Bronson , Carey said the following regarding the contract : " I signed blindly . Later , I tried to make it right so we could continue ... but he wouldn 't accept it . " After the settlement , Margulies spoke of his feelings on the matter , claiming he would hope to one day write again with Carey , placing most of the blame on the record label and concluding " Hopefully one day , art will prevail over business . " 
 = = Recording = = 
 Mariah Carey had originally been recorded in Margulies ' father 's basement , with old and minimal equipment . After being signed to Columbia , the songs that would be used for the album were re @-@ mastered and re @-@ recorded in professional studios . However , due to Sony 's involvement in the project , they did not allow Carey to produce most of the album , hoping the aid of several famed record producers would be able to ensure Carey 's already deemed " exquisite " songs would become popular . After the album 's success however , Carey was allowed more freedom on Emotions than on her debut . Since she no longer had a working or personal relationship with Margulies , she chose to work with mostly different musicians than those of her previous effort , with the exception of Walter Afanasieff , the only hold over from Mariah Carey . Even though he had only co @-@ written " Love Takes Time " , and had only produced part of the album , Carey felt a strong working chemistry with him , soon developing a unique form of songwriting alongside him . Aside from Afanasieff , Carey worked with Robert Clivillés and David Cole from the dance @-@ music influenced production duo , C + C Music Factory . Working with the duo was originally Mottola 's suggestion , but after meeting the pair , Carey agreed and wrote four songs together with them . 
 Additionally , aside from the three men , Carey worked with Carole King , a female singer @-@ songwriter who had been predominantly popular in the 1970s . However , unlike with C + C Music Factory , King approached Carey , hoping to work with her after hearing her perform live on The Arsenio Hall Show . During a conversation with Carey , King suggested that she cover " ( You Make Me Feel Like ) A Natural Woman " , a song she had written with Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin . After giving it some thought , Carey declined the offer , feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly . Still determined on working with Carey , King flew to New York for one day , to try to create a ballad of some sort . The two ladies sat together by a piano over the course of the day , and by nightfall , had written and arranged a song titled " If It 's Over " . After working with Carey , King said in an interview " I love her voice . She 's very expressive . She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings . " After recording " If It 's Over " , Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff , as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him , or working with C + C Music Factory . When working with Afanasieff , the duo would sit by a piano , and lead each other vocally and musically , until they would reach the right note and arrangement . During an interview in 1992 , Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him , and begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of , while he would follow her with the piano . In doing so , he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa . Carey described their working relationship as " very unique , " and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies . While similar , Carey 's creative process with Cole and Clivillés proved different ; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes , of which she would choose from . Afterwards , they would work on building the already created melody , and have Carey add and build onto it , as well as writing the lyrics and key . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Unlike Carey 's debut album , which featured a more contemporary pop and R & B background , Emotions proved to be far different . It borrowed from several genres ranging from gospel , R & B , soul , pop and 1960s and 1970s influences . The album 's lead single " Emotions " borrowed heavily from 1970s disco , and flaunted Carey 's upper range and extensive use of the whistle register . The song 's lyrics were described as " joyful " by author Chris Nickson , and told of a strong and deep emotion felt by the protagonist when with their lover . One of the album 's more gospel infused songs , " And You Don 't Remember " , featured organ chord changes and held minimal production in order to give the vocals a more " raw and sixties feel . " It and the former song were part of a trio of tracks from the album that were meant to pay homage to Motown ballads , with the inclusion of soft church choir vocals , and sole musical arrangement by Carey . Its lyrics reflected the song 's raw chorus , telling of girl that is promised the world by her boyfriend , and quickly forget about her and moves to the next one . After the heartbreak , the protagonist asks him " Don 't You Remember " all those things he had promised her , and the things they had spoken and dreamed about doing together . " Can 't Let Go " , the album 's second single , is a slow ballad , featuring sad and yearning lyrical content . The song 's introduction featured minor chord changes , and drew influence from fifties balladry . For the duration of the first half of the song , Carey sings in her lower and huskier registers , eventually leading to the belted crescendo and falsetto and whistle finish . Of the ten tracks on the album , Carey felt her most autobiographical lyrics were featured on " Make It Happen " , which told of Carey 's poor and difficult teen life prior to being signed by Columbia . It continues telling of the importance of faith and prayer to God . Nickson described its instrumentation as " restrained " and " very <unk> , " as well as noting its soft gospel infusion . Critically , the most anticipated song on the album was Carey 's collaboration with King . It was influenced by sixties and seventies gospel and other soulful genres . According to Nickson , the song 's instrumentation and basis was crucial to Carey 's performance throughout the song . Additionally , he described its content and instrumentation : 
 As a song full of gospel and soulful influences , it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show what she could do – which in reality was far more than the vocal gymnastics that seemed to comprise her reputation so far . From a deep rumble to a high wail , she covered five octaves wonderfully , as the power of the tune built . The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody , as did the stately horns , which entered towards the end . The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah . 
 The next song on the album 's track list , " You 're So Cold " , was originally intended to be the lead single from Emotions , eventually being switched for the title track . The song 's introduction features a piano and a capella vocal , working into its chorus . Chris Nickson wrote " The song sailed into the chorus , driven by the house @-@ y piano work , the bubbly , snacking rhythm belying the angry lyrics , the upbeat tone of voice . " As Nickson hinted at , its lyrics featured an angry message , calling out an unfaithful lover and asking how he could be " So Cold . " " So Blessed " was a song Carey wrote with Afanasieff , infusing fifties style pop balladry into it . Carey 's voice in the song is very restrained , as she stays within her lower registers throughout the duration of the track . " To Be Around You " was described by Nickson as " far more staccato . " Its production and melody was intended to pay tribute to " Got to Be Real " by Cheryl Lynn , as well as featuring spoken voices towards the end of the song . Nickson described " Till the End of Time " as a " gentle , almost lullaby melody . " It was a love ballad , preparing the listener for the song 's final track , " The Wind " . The latter song featured the album 's strongest jazz influence , and sampled a piano melody from Russell Freeman during the 1950s . After Afanasieff presented Carey with the melody he had discovered , it inspired her to write the melody and lyrics , which told of a friend that perished in a drunk @-@ driving accident . Musically , the album fulfilled its greatest challenge , according to critics . It had helped master Carey 's usage and infusion of several genres which she had not tapped into during the recording of her debut . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Upon its release , Emotions garnered generally mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics , many of whom both praised and criticized the album 's content alongside Carey 's vocal acrobatics . Bill Lamb from About.com gave Emotions three and a half out of five stars , complimenting the album as a whole , claiming it to be " tightened " when in comparison to the original . He described the album 's lead single as " bone chilling , " however criticizing some of the Carey 's high notes as " vocal range overkill . " Allmusic editor , Ashley Battel , gave the album four out of five stars , calling it a " musical journey . " Additionally , Erlewine picked " Emotions " and " Make It Happen " as the album 's standout tracks and wrote " The one emotion that prevails upon completion of the album is definitely a positive one : satisfaction . " Parry Gettelman , editor from the Orlando Sentinel , was critical on Carey 's vocal acrobatics , writing " Carey has become so enamored of the ultra @-@ high @-@ frequency part of her range that I 'm starting to suspect she may be an intergalactic spy trying to re- establish communications with the far @-@ off Planet of Dogs . " Jonathan <unk> from the Sun @-@ Sentinel gave Emotions a mixed review , writing " Oddly , the album gets more original at the end , where not all people will bother getting to . " Further in the review , he outed " The Wind " and " Till the End of Time " as the album 's stand out tracks , but felt most of the album was unoriginal and not an improvement over her debut . 
 Steve Morse from The Boston Globe gave the album a positive review , calling it " a quantum leap in maturity and confidence . " Morse felt Emotions was superior to Carey 's debut , calling its lyrics " remarkable , " its ballads " unspeakably beautiful , " and Carey 's vocal and songwriting ability " unlimited . " Rob Tannenbaum from Rolling Stone was critical on the album , expressing how Carey 's extensive use of her range made it difficult to truly feel and connect to the lyrics within the songs . Tannenbaum concluded his review on Emotions with " Carey has a remarkable vocal gift , but to date , unfortunately , her singing has been far more impressive than expressive . " Arion Berger from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C , calling it " colder and more calculated " than Carey 's debut . Additionally , Berger mirrored similar sentiments written by Tannenbaum , writing " [ Emotions ] is the hybrid progeny of a venerable tradition — the tradition of the R & B diva — and crass commercial <unk> it 's gospel without soul , love songs without passion , pop without buoyancy . " Robert Christgau said nothing on the album , but gave it a " dud " score . Deborah Wilker , editor of the Sun @-@ Sentinel , complimented Carey 's vocal and singing abilities , however criticizing some of the album 's content as a whole . Wilker wrote " With her elite industry connections and top @-@ notch voice , Carey can do better . Sure this set is enjoyable and provides pop fans with a new diva to idolize , but Carey and company <unk> come close to exploiting the full range of her musical potential . " Dennis Hunt from the Los Angeles Times gave the album two out of a possible four stars . After comparing calling Carey 's voice to that of Whitney Houston 's , he called it " spectacular and impressive , " but criticized the album 's songs and production for " playing high on the angst scale . " Editor of the Chicago Tribune , Jan DeKnock , gave the album three stars , indicating a " Good " review . She called some of the album 's ballads " boring , " but described Carey 's voice as " breathtaking . "

 = Black Cat Bar = 
 The Black Cat Bar or Black Cat Café was a bar in San Francisco , California . It originally opened in 1906 and closed in 1921 . The Black Cat re @-@ opened in 1933 and operated for another 30 years . During its second run of operation , it was a hangout for Beats and bohemians but over time began attracting more and more of a gay clientele . 
 Because it catered to gay people , the bar became a flashpoint for the nascent homophile movement . The Black Cat was at the center of a legal fight that was one of the earliest court cases to establish legal protections for gay people in the United States . Despite this victory , continued pressure from law enforcement agencies eventually forced the bar 's closure in 1964 . 
 = = The original Black Cat = = 
 The Black Cat opened in 1906 , shortly after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . In the early years , the bar was located in the basement of the Athens Hotel at 56 Mason Street in San Francisco 's Tenderloin neighborhood . This building still stands today and is now the Bristol Hotel . When entrepreneur Charles Ridley acquired the bar in 1911 , he turned it into a showplace for vaudeville @-@ style acts . Over the next several years , Ridley and the Black Cat came under increased police scrutiny as a possible center of prostitution . In 1921 , the bar lost its dance permit and closed down . 
 = = Beats and bohemians = = 
 With the repeal of Prohibition , the Black Cat re @-@ opened in 1933 at 710 Montgomery Street , again under Ridley 's proprietorship . Sol Stoumen bought the bar in the 1940s . In the early years of Stoumen 's ownership , the Black Cat was a center for the bohemian and Beat crowd . William Saroyan and John Steinbeck were known to frequent the establishment , and part of Jack Kerouac 's seminal Beat novel On the Road is set in the bar . 
 = = Growing gay clientele = = 
 While the Beats continued to congregate at the Black Cat into the 1950s , in the years following World War II , more and more gay people began patronizing it . The varied crowds mixed and gay Beat poet Allen Ginsberg described the Black Cat as " the best gay bar in America . It was totally open , bohemian , San Francisco ... and everybody went there , heterosexual and homosexual .... All the gay screaming queens would come , the heterosexual gray flannel suit types , longshoremen . All the poets went there . " By 1951 , the bar was placed on the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board 's list of establishments which military personnel were forbidden to enter . 
 The bar featured live entertainers , the best known of whom was José Sarria . Sarria , who began as a waiter , wore drag and entertained the crowd by singing parodies of popular torch songs . Eventually he performed three to four shows a night , along with a regular Sunday afternoon show , with Sarria performing full arias . His specialty was a re @-@ working of Bizet 's opera Carmen , set in modern @-@ day San Francisco . Sarria as Carmen would prowl through popular cruising area Union Square . The audience cheered " Carmen " on as she dodged the vice squad and made her escape . 
 Sarria encouraged patrons to be as open and honest as possible , exhorting the clientele , " There 's nothing wrong with being gay – the crime is getting caught , " and " United we stand , divided they catch us one by one . " At closing time , he would lead patrons in singing " God Save Us Nelly Queens " to the tune of " God Save the Queen " . Sometimes he would take the crowd outside to sing the final verse to the men across the street in jail , who had been arrested in raids earlier in the night . Speaking of this ritual in the film Word is Out ( 1977 ) , gay journalist George Mendenhall said : 
 " It sounds silly , but if you lived at that time and had the oppression coming down from the police department and from society , there was nowhere to turn ... and to be able to put your arms around other gay men and to be able to stand up and sing ' God Save Us Nelly Queens ' ... we were really not saying ' God Save Us Nelly Queens . ' We were saying ' We have our rights , too . ' " 
 Sarria became the first openly gay candidate in the United States to run for public office , running in 1961 for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors . Sarria almost won by default . On the last day for candidates to file petitions , city officials realized that there were fewer than five candidates running for the five open seats , which would have assured Sarria a seat . By the end of the day , 34 candidates had filed . Sarria garnered some 6 @,@ 000 votes , shocking political pundits and setting in motion the idea that a gay voting bloc could wield real power in city politics . As Sarria put it , " From that day on , nobody ran for anything in San Francisco without knocking on the door of the gay community . " 
 = = Police harassment = = 
 In 1948 , the San Francisco Police Department and the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission , in response to the Black Cat 's increasing homosexual clientele , began a campaign of harassment against the bar and its patrons . Bar owner Stoumen was charged with such crimes as " keeping a disorderly house " and the State Board of Equalization suspended the bar 's liquor license indefinitely . In response and on principle , Stoumen , who was heterosexual , took the state to court . In 1951 , the California Supreme Court , in Stoumen v. Reilly ( 37 <unk> 713 ) ruled that " [ i ] n order to establish ' good cause ' for suspension of plaintiff 's license , something more must be shown than that many of his patrons were homosexuals and that they used his restaurant and bar as a meeting place . " This was one of the earliest legal affirmations of the rights of gay people in the United States . The court qualified its opinion , however , by stating that ABC might still close gay bars with " proof of the commission of illegal or immoral acts on the premises . " 
 In response to this legal victory and based on the " illegal or immoral acts " language of the opinion , the state passed a constitutional amendment creating the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control ( ABC ) . The California State Assembly in 1955 passed a law authorizing broad powers for the ABC to shut down any " resort [ for ] sexual perverts . " The Black Cat was shut down under this authority , along with a number of other establishments . In a test case involving an Oakland bar , <unk> v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control , the California Supreme Court struck down this new law as unconstitutional . This decision was not a complete victory , as the court noted that had the ABC 's revocation been based on " reports of women dancing with other women and women kissing other women " it might have upheld the law . Homosexuals , therefore , had won the right to assemble but only if they agreed not to touch . 
 Police and city officials responded to the increasing visibility of the Black Cat and other gay bars in the city , and the Black Cat 's success in court , by increasingly cracking down , staging more frequent raids and mass arrests . One favorite tactic was to arrest drag queens , since impersonating a member of the opposite sex was , at the time , a crime . Sarria responded by passing out labels for the drag queens to wear reading " I am a boy " so it could not be claimed they were impersonating women .

 By 1963 , following some 15 years of unrelenting pressure from the police and the ABC , Stoumen decided he was no longer able financially to sustain the fight . The cost of his long legal battle was more than $ 38 @,@ 000 . Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city 's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his legal bills , but none offered any assistance . The ABC lifted the bar 's liquor license in 1963 , the night before its annual Halloween party . After a final defiant Halloween celebration at which only non @-@ alcoholic beverages were served and an attempt to survive on food and soft drink sales , the Black Cat closed down for good in February 1964 . 
 The site is now the location of <unk> , a tapas @-@ style restaurant . On December 15 , 2007 , a plaque commemorating the Black Cat and its place in San Francisco history was placed at the site . 
 = New York State Route 37B = 
 New York State Route 37B ( NY 37B ) is an east – west state highway located in St. Lawrence County , New York , in the United States . It serves as a business route of NY 37 through the village of Massena . While NY 37B enters the village , NY 37 bypasses it to the south . The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 37 in the town of Louisville . Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 37 just east of the village limits in the town of Massena . NY 37B intersects North Main Street , a state @-@ maintained northward extension of NY 420 , in Massena 's central district . 
 The origins of NY 37B date back to the early 20th century when the New York State Legislature created Route 32 , an unsigned legislative route extending from North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Massena . From Waddington to Massena , Route 32 followed River Road and Town Line Road . This portion of the route became part of NY 3 in 1924 . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the Waddington – Massena segment of NY 3 became NY 37B . The route was extended east into Massena in the 1950s after NY 37 was realigned to follow a new bypass around the village . 
 Most of NY 37B west of Massena ran through a low @-@ lying area along the St. Lawrence River . In 1958 , this area was permanently <unk> as part of the St. Lawrence Seaway 's construction . As a result , NY 37B was rerouted to follow a new roadway along the fringe of Lake St. Lawrence to meet NY 37 in Louisville Corner . A connector between NY 37 and NY 37B in Louisville was designated as NY 131 by 1960 . The alignments of NY 37B and NY 131 west of Massena were swapped c . 1962 , placing NY 37B on its modern alignment . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 37B begins at an intersection with its parent route , NY 37 , in the town of Louisville . The route heads to the northeast , paralleling the Grasse River as it passes a small number of homes and businesses located in the otherwise rural town . There are small patches of forested areas along the way to the Massena village line ( and the town 's line of the same name ) , where it intersects with Town Line Road ( County Route 43 ) . Once in Massena , the amount of development along the highway begins to increase . NY 37B , now known as Maple Street , continues northeast through Massena for three blocks before veering eastward upon passing Massena Memorial Hospital . 
 In the center of Massena , NY 37B intersects North Main Street , which connects to NY 420 south of the village . The portion of Main Street between NY 420 and NY 37B is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . Past North Main Street , NY 37B follows Maple Street southeast to Center Street . The route merges with Center Street and becomes a divided highway as it connects to Willow Street by way of an interchange and intersects an eastward extension of Center Street . 
 NY 37B turns south at the interchange , becoming Parker Avenue and crossing over the Grasse River to meet East Orvis Street on the southern riverbank . Here , the route turns east to follow East Orvis Street northeastward through the residential and commercial areas that comprise southeastern Massena . At the Massena village line , East Orvis Street becomes Highland Road , a name NY 37B retains for a short distance eastward to a junction with NY 37 ( St. Regis Boulevard ) . Although Highland Road continues through the intersection , NY 37B ends at the junction . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1908 , the New York State Legislature created Route 32 , an unsigned legislative route extending from North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena . It entered Massena on what is now NY 420 and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village . West of Massena , the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of Waddington , where Route 32 continued west on modern NY 37 to Waddington . When state highways in New York were first posted in 1924 , the portion of Route 32 between Waddington and Massena became part of NY 3 , a highway extending across the width of the state . 
 The segment of NY 3 east of Watertown was rerouted as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to largely follow its modern alignment between Watertown and Plattsburgh . Most of NY 3 's former alignment along the St. Lawrence River from Alexandria Bay to Hogansburg became part of the new NY 37 ; however , from Waddington to Massena , NY 37 used a more inland routing . As a result , the former routing of NY 3 between the two villages became NY 37B instead . In the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1950s , NY 37 was rerouted to follow a new bypass around the southern edge of Massena . Following its completion , NY 37B was extended eastward along NY 37 's former routing on Maple Street , Parker Avenue , and Orvis Street to meet the bypass east of the village . 
 In the 1950s , construction began on the St. Lawrence Seaway , a system of canals and locks that would make the St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping . As part of the seaway 's construction , a low @-@ lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington , New York , and Cornwall , Ontario , would be inundated with water in order to create a navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall . Much of NY 37B was located within the flood @-@ prone region due to its proximity to the river . On July 1 , 1958 , the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a cofferdam upstream , creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY 37B west of Massena . 
 Following the destruction of the majority of NY 37B , the route was realigned west of Massena to follow a new riverside roadway to the hamlet of Louisville Corner , where it came to an end at NY 37 . The remainder of NY 37B along the Massena – Louisville town line road and in Massena was unchanged . By 1960 , a connector between NY 37 in Louisville and NY 37B and Massena utilizing NY 37 's former routing west of the village was designated as NY 131 . The alignments of NY 37B and NY 131 west of the Maple Street / Town Line Road intersection were flipped c . 1962 , placing NY 131 on the riverside and town line roads and NY 37B on NY 37 's former routing into Massena .

 = Carolina wren = 
 The Carolina wren ( Thryothorus ludovicianus ) is a common species of wren that is a resident in the eastern half of the United States of America , the extreme south of Ontario , Canada , and the extreme northeast of Mexico . Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range . Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forests , farm edges and suburban areas . This wren is the state bird of South Carolina . 
 There are seven recognized subspecies across the range of these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance . The birds are generally inconspicuous , avoiding the open for extended periods of time . When out in the open , they investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary . After finding a mate , pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years . Both sexes give out alarm calls , but only males sing to <unk> territory . Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season , but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown @-@ headed cowbirds , among other species . Some populations have been affected by mercury contamination . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Carolina wren was first described under the name of Sylvia <unk> by John Latham in 1790 . Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot considered all wrens under the genus Troglodytes and called the Carolina wren Troglodytes <unk> but placed it subsequently in a separate genus Thryothorus ( initially misspelled <unk> ) that he created in 1816 . Thryothorus is of Greek origin from the combination of <unk> ( rush , reed ) and <unk> ( derivative of verb <unk> to leap up , spring , jump at ) which means ' reed jumper ' ; its specific name ludovicianus is a post @-@ classical Latin term for <unk> ( derivative from Louis XIV ) that means ' of Louisiana ' that identifies the locality of the specimen collected near New Orleans . 
 There are seven recognized subspecies of the Carolina wren : 
 T. l. ludovicianus ( Latham , 1790 ) – Southeast Canada ( Southern Ontario , irregularly in Eastern and Southern Quebec ) and the eastern United States ( Southern Wisconsin and New England southward to Texas and northern Florida ) . 
 T. l. miamensis Florida wren ( Ridgway , 1875 ) – Florida from approximately 30 degrees ( Gainesville ) region southward through the rest of the state . 
 T. l. <unk> ( Stevenson , 1973 ) – Dog Island in Northwestern Florida . 
 T. l. burleighi – Burleigh 's Carolina wren ( Lowery , 1940 ) Offshore islands off of the Mississippi coast : Cat Island , Ship Island ( Mississippi ) , and Horn Island . 
 T. l. <unk> – Lomita wren ( Sennett , 1890 ) southern Texas to the extreme northeast of Mexico ( Tamaulipas ) . 
 T. l. berlandieri – <unk> 's wren ( S. F. Baird , 1858 ) Northeastern Mexico ( eastern Coahuila , Nuevo Leon , and southwestern Tamaulipas ) 
 T. l. tropicalis – Northeastern Mexico ( eastern San Luis Potosi and southern Tamaulipas ) . 
 T. ludovicianus is traditionally placed within its own genus as its only representative of North America , but recent DNA work suggests it is closely allied with the Bewick 's wren . A distinct population in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico , Belize , Nicaragua , and in Guatemala is treated as a separate species , either known as Cabot 's wren or white @-@ browed wren ( Thryothorus <unk> ) . It is considered a subspecies of T. ludovicianus by some authors , however . 
 = = Description = = 
 At 12 @.@ 5 to 14 cm ( 4 @.@ 9 to 5 @.@ 5 in ) long , with a 29 cm ( 11 in ) wingspan and a weight of about 18 to 23 g ( 0 @.@ 63 to 0 @.@ 81 oz ) , the Carolina wren is a fairly large wren ; the second largest in the United States species after the cactus wren . Among standard measurements , the wing chord is 5 @.@ 4 to 6 @.@ 4 cm ( 2 @.@ 1 to 2 @.@ 5 in ) , the tail is 4 @.@ 5 to 5 @.@ 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 2 in ) , the culmen is 1 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 55 to 0 @.@ 71 in ) and the tarsus is 2 to 2 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 to 0 @.@ 91 in ) . Sexual dimorphism is slight with males being larger than their mates . A study indicated that out of 42 mated pairs , all but one of male was larger than the female of the pair . The males were on average 11 percent heavier along with having longer wing chords . 
 There are several differences among the subspecies . For T. l. ludovicianus , the crown is rich brown that appears more chestnut @-@ colored on its rump and uppertail @-@ coverts . Shoulders and greater coverts are a rich brown , with a series of small white dots on the lesser primary coverts . The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs ; the bars on the primaries are on the <unk> only , but darker and more noticeable . The <unk> are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail . The white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below , and extends above and beyond its shoulders . The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish @-@ black . Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest , flank and belly , though the latter two are of a warmer color . The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color . Its iris is reddish @-@ brown , the upper mandible is lemon @-@ colored and paler at the base and lower mandible . The legs are flesh @-@ colored . 
 As for the other subspecies in contrast to T. l. ludovicianus , T. l. berlandieri is of a slightly smaller build , but possesses a larger bill , the upperparts are duller brown with deeper colored underparts , T. l. <unk> is of a duller color ( than either ludovicianus or berlandieri ) with its underparts either pale or almost white , T. l. miamensis contains darker rusty chestnut upperparts and deeper colored below . T. l. burleighi is duller and <unk> with less distinct tail markings , T. l. <unk> has paler underparts and a whiter supercilium , and T. l. tropicalis is darker than all races , and contains heavier bars than T. l. berlandieri . 
 = = = Plumage = = = 
 The juvenile <unk> ludovicianus is similar in appearance , but the plumage is generally paler with a softer texture with buff @-@ tipped wing coverts , a superciliary streak is less white , a fluffy vent and <unk> ( flanks ) without bars . In August and September , the partial plumage molt for the post @-@ juvenile wrens is darker in color and affects the contour plumage , wing coverts , tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe . The post @-@ nuptial molt for adults in the same time period is more pronounced in color than the spring molt , with both sexes similar in appearance . 
 = = = Life span = = = 
 Survival rates differ by region . A male captured in Arkansas lived to be at least 73 months old , and in Alabama , the oldest female and male captured were six and ten years old , respectively . A mark @-@ and @-@ recapture analysis of the wrens analyzing survival probability within the Southeastern United States captured was monitored from 1992 to 2003 . Roughly 90 percent of the banded wrens died within 10 years . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The easiest species to confuse with the Carolina wren is Bewick 's wren , which differs in being smaller but with a longer tail , grayer @-@ brown above and whiter below . The Carolina and white @-@ browed wrens differ from the house wren in being larger , with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe ; their culmen has a notch behind the tip . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 These birds are largely resident , and will only disperse beyond their range after mild winters . Carolina wrens sporadically breed as far north as Maine and Quebec after mild winters . In certain parts of their range , such as most of Iowa , prolonged periods of snow can curtail potential expansion . Permanent breeding locations range from eastern Nebraska , southern Michigan , southeast Ontario and the New England states to Mexican states such as Coahuila , Nuevo León , San Luis Potosí and Tamaulipas and the Gulf Coast of the United States . Local occurrences with infrequent and likely breeding locations include southeast South Dakota , central Kansas , eastern Colorado , western Oklahoma and Texas as far as Maine and New Brunswick . There have been occasional vagrants spotted in Colorado , New Mexico , and Arizona , Wyoming , South Dakota , Manitoba , Nova Scotia , and the Gulf of St. Lawrence . 
 The range of the wrens increased northward and westward in several regions over the past few centuries . In Massachusetts , the wrens had expanded westward and northeastward from its former southeastern location in approximately 35 years , in New York the population increased three @-@ fold in roughly 25 years , while in midwest states such as Ohio and Michigan have seen numbers of the birds increase since the mid @-@ 1800s and early 1900s , respectively . Expansion around Ontario occurred since early reports in 1890 and 1905 . Explanations given include infrequent winter storms in the 20th century , expanded forest habitats , and the wrens taking advantage of urban areas containing feeders , especially in winter . 
 Carolina wrens adapt to various habitats . Natural habitats include various types of woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak @-@ pine woodlands , ash and <unk> , hickory @-@ oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth . The preferred habitats are riparian forests , brushy edges , swamps , overgrown farmlands , and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees , and parks . It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man @-@ made areas . Subspecies burleighi and <unk> inhabit slash pine and palmettos . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Song and calls = = = 
 Carolina wrens sing year round and at any point during the daytime , with the exception of performing during the most harsh weather conditions . The birds are also the only species in the <unk> family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size . Males alone sing , and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average , thirty two . One of these patterns is repeated for several minutes , and although the male 's song can be repeated up to twelve times , the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition . While singing , the tail of the birds is pointed downward . Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle @-@ teakettle @-@ teakettle and cheery @-@ cheery @-@ cheery . Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee @-@ udel , whee @-@ udel , whee @-@ udel , che @-@ <unk> , che @-@ <unk> and túrtee @-@ túrtee @-@ túrtee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart , sweet heart , come to me , come to me , sweet William , and Richelieu , Richelieu . 
 Males are capable of increasing their repertoire through song learning , but due to their sedentary nature and territorial defense habits , the song learning must occur within the first three months of life . Geographic barriers affect song repertoire size from male wrens , as one study indicated that distances separated as close as 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) by water barriers can have the same effect as that of a distance of 145 kilometres ( 90 mi ) in the mainland with no barriers . 
 Female Carolina wrens possess song control regions that would appear to make them capable of singing with repertoires like the male . Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male , it has been suggested that song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance . 
 Different subspecies have variations in songs and calls , such as miamensis having a more rapid song that contains more notes than the races that are further north . 
 Their songs can be confused with the Kentucky warbler . The song patterns are similar , but is of a different quality , as the warbler 's songs is described as richer , with more ringing and a hurried pace . Other bird species that have their songs described as akin to the wrens are the flicker , Baltimore oriole , gray catbird , and more specifically the peto , peto , peto calls of the tufted titmouse , and whistles of the northern cardinal . Occasionally , the wrens mimic other species , and in Pennsylvania it has led for it to be also known as the ' mocking wren ' . 
 = = = Sexual selection = = = 
 A 2006 study suggested that the correlation of tail length and body size in males , wing length in females , and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality , and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals . The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use . Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle . Due to the large size of male wrens and the male 's vigor in defending its territory , intrasexual selection was given as a possible explanation for the sexual dimorphism . 
 = = = Territorial and predator defense = = = 
 Both sexes are involved in defending the territory . One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying the proximity of the threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls . In experiments involving playback , the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and <unk> songs , as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions , and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories , such as songs under foliage . Song degradation can also be used to determine the proximity of potential intruders . If the song of a bird appears to be degraded , the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond ; if the song is not degraded , they respond by attacking . Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies . Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as ' dear @-@ enemies ' by the wrens , and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season . In spring , the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors , though in the fall , no major discrepancy in responses is shown . When protecting their nest , alarm calls are the general response . The wrens judge the size of the potential threat , such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking . <unk> produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens . 
 Both males and females utilize calls in alarm situations , especially in territorial disputes and encounters with predators . Males alone produce the cheer call , which can sound indistinct . In southern regions of their range , the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p <unk> sound . Females are the only ones that can perform the paired dit @-@ dit or chatter sounds . The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators , and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant . The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song , and the song can either follow or overlap her mate 's song . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Carolina wrens spend the majority of their time on or near the ground searching for food , or in tangles of vegetation and vines . They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels , or pick up leaf @-@ litter in order to search for prey . Their diet consists of invertebrates , such as beetles , true bugs , grasshoppers , katydids , spiders , ants , bees , and wasps . Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet . Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets , such as fruit pulp and various seeds . In the northern portion of their range , they frequent bird feeders . 
 = = = Movement = = = 
 Carolina wrens are wary , and are more often heard than seen . When on the ground , they move in jerky hops pillaging through various objects , whether man @-@ made or natural . While moving abruptly , they pause momentarily for chattering or singing . When stationary , they move in twitched motions , jerking their breast around . They also <unk> or sand @-@ bathe . The wrens also displays a skittish behavior when encountered by humans , as they can be seen thrusting off into cover slowly if approaching is detected . However , they occasionally seek out humans that are near , so long as there is no movement from them . Other movements involve being capable of crawling like a creeper and hanging upside @-@ down like a nuthatch . 
 Flights are generally of short duration , rapid , low @-@ leveled , and wavelike . The wings during flight are flapped rapidly , and are frequently used during foraging . They are also capable of flying vertically from the base of a tree to the top in a single wing assisted bound . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Carolina wrens are both genetically and socially monogamous and will usually mate for life . Mate changing is rare , and there has been one possible instance of polygamy . During the winter season , males are more responsible for guarding the territory . Females vary in succeeding to maintain winter territories without a mate . It has been suggested that the possibility of desertion and decline in care @-@ taking from males along with the need for security in resources year @-@ round prevent extra pair copulations from females , as the mortality rate for Carolina wrens peaks during the winter . Along with thermoregulatory benefits , roosting is thought to reinforce pair @-@ bonding and prevent divorce between mates . 
 The nests are arch @-@ shaped structures with a side entrance and built of dried plants or strips of bark , as well as horsehair , string , wool and snake sloughs . Males obtain nesting materials while the females remains at the site to construct the nest . Nests are located in fragmented or complete cavities in trees , or in man @-@ made structures such as bird @-@ boxes , buildings , tin cans , mailboxes or unorthodox places such as pockets of hanging jackets in sheds or in a tractor in everyday use . Nests are from 1 – 3 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 9 @.@ 8 ft ) from the ground and are rarely higher . They occasionally can be built in sloping locations or at ground level . 
 Egg laying dates and clutch size vary by region ; in Texas the time period is from late February to late August , in Iowa it ranges from late April to June . The clutch size is generally 3 to 6 eggs , but can reach as high as seven in Texas . The eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish @-@ brown spots , and are more heavily marked at the broad end . The eggs are incubated by the female for 12 – 16 days . After the young hatch , they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12 – 14 days . As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season . In one study , three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area . 
 Male and females are involved in the process of provisioning at similar rates throughout most nest stages , with the males providing slightly more in the nestling stages . Both sexes increase their provision rates as the nestlings grow in age . 
 = = Predation and threats = = 
 Brood parasitism by brown @-@ headed cowbirds is common , with up to 25 % of Carolina wren nests being affected in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama . Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41 % , and is as low as 8 % and 0 % in July and August , respectively . Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own , and even if host eggs are retained , the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs . As a result , cowbirds may have a significant impact on the reproductive success of wrens . The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates , and some have been raised to independence . This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings . A rare instance of brood @-@ parasitism by a house finch has been recorded . The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations . Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings . Fellow species of wren such as Bewick 's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food , respectively . 
 In Virginia , some Carolina wrens populations show high levels of mercury in their blood and this is acquired from feeding all @-@ year @-@ round on spiders . Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury ( through biomagnification ) than herbivorous invertebrates . As these wrens are year @-@ round residents , they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood . Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content . Exposure , and prolonged periods of cold , ice , and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations , respectively . Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season . 
 Among the top predators of adult Carolina wrens are domestic cats , and snakes such as the <unk> rattlesnake . Raccoons and black rat snakes also feed on wren eggs and nestlings .

 In 1930 , the South Carolina Federated Women 's club adopted the Carolina wren as the unofficial state bird over the eastern mourning dove and pushed for its official state adoption until 1939 , when the South Carolina Legislature named the northern mockingbird as the state bird . In 1948 , the legislature repealed their previous decision , and the wren became the official state bird . 
 In 2000 , the Carolina wren was featured on the back of the South Carolina edition of the 50 State Quarters . 
 = Insect = 
 Insects ( from Latin <unk> , a calque of Greek <unk> [ <unk> ] , " cut into sections " ) are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton , a three @-@ part body ( head , thorax and abdomen ) , three pairs of jointed legs , compound eyes and one pair of antennae . They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet , including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms . The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million , and potentially represent over 90 % of the differing animal life forms on Earth . Insects may be found in nearly all environments , although only a small number of species reside in the oceans , a habitat dominated by another arthropod group , crustaceans . 
 The life cycles of insects vary but most hatch from eggs . Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts . The immature stages can differ from the adults in structure , habit and habitat , and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo 4 @-@ stage metamorphosis ( see <unk> ) . Insects that undergo 3 @-@ stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages . The higher level relationship of the Hexapoda is unclear . Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era , including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm ( 22 – 28 in ) . The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants . 
 Adult insects typically move about by walking , flying or sometimes swimming ( see below , Locomotion ) . As it allows for rapid yet stable movement , many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles . Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight . Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water , with larval adaptations that include gills , and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming . Some species , such as water striders , are capable of walking on the surface of water . Insects are mostly solitary , but some , such as certain bees , ants and termites , are social and live in large , well @-@ organized colonies . Some insects , such as earwigs , show maternal care , guarding their eggs and young . Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways . Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances . Other species communicate with sounds : crickets stridulate , or rub their wings together , to attract a mate and repel other males . Lampyridae in the beetle order Coleoptera communicate with light . 
 Humans regard certain insects as pests , and attempt to control them using insecticides and a host of other techniques . Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap , leaves or fruits . A few parasitic species are pathogenic . Some insects perform complex ecological roles ; blow @-@ flies , for example , help consume carrion but also spread diseases . Insect pollinators are essential to the life @-@ cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms , including humans , are at least partly dependent ; without them , the terrestrial portion of the biosphere ( including humans ) would be devastated . Many other insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit . <unk> and bees have been used extensively by humans for the production of silk and honey , respectively . In some cultures , people eat the larvae or adults of certain insects . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word " insect " comes from the Latin word <unk> , meaning " with a notched or divided body " , or literally " cut into " , from the neuter singular perfect passive participle of <unk> , " to cut into , to cut up " , from in- " into " and <unk> " to cut " ; because insects appear " cut into " three sections . Pliny the Elder introduced the Latin designation as a loan @-@ translation of the Greek word <unk> ( <unk> ) or " insect " ( as in entomology ) , which was Aristotle 's term for this class of life , also in reference to their " notched " bodies . " Insect " first appears documented in English in 1601 in Holland 's translation of Pliny . Translations of Aristotle 's term also form the usual word for " insect " in Welsh ( <unk> , from <unk> " to cut " and mil , " animal " ) , Serbo @-@ Croatian ( <unk> , from <unk> , " to cut " ) , Russian ( <unk> <unk> , from <unk> ' / <unk> ' , " to cut " ) , etc . 
 = = Phylogeny and evolution = = 
 The evolutionary relationship of insects to other animal groups remains unclear . 
 Although traditionally grouped with millipedes and centipedes — possibly on the basis of convergent adaptations to <unk> — evidence has emerged favoring closer evolutionary ties with crustaceans . In the Pancrustacea theory , insects , together with <unk> , Remipedia , and Cephalocarida , make up a natural clade labeled <unk> . 
 A report in November 2014 unambiguously places the insects in one clade , with the crustaceans and myriapods , as the nearest sister clades . This study resolved insect phylogeny of all extant insect orders , and provides " a robust phylogenetic backbone tree and reliable time estimates of insect evolution . " 
 Other terrestrial arthropods , such as centipedes , millipedes , scorpions , and spiders , are sometimes confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar , sharing ( as do all arthropods ) a jointed exoskeleton . However , upon closer examination , their features differ significantly ; most noticeably , they do not have the six @-@ legged characteristic of adult insects . 
 The higher @-@ level phylogeny of the arthropods continues to be a matter of debate and research . In 2008 , researchers at Tufts University uncovered what they believe is the world 's oldest known full @-@ body impression of a primitive flying insect , a 300 million @-@ year @-@ old specimen from the Carboniferous period . The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti , from the 396 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Rhynie chert . It may have superficially resembled a modern @-@ day silverfish insect . This species already possessed <unk> mandibles ( two articulations in the mandible ) , a feature associated with winged insects , suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time . Thus , the first insects probably appeared earlier , in the Silurian period . 
 Four super radiations of insects have occurred : beetles ( evolved about 300 million years ago ) , flies ( evolved about 250 million years ago ) , and moths and wasps ( evolved about 150 million years ago ) . These four groups account for the majority of described species . The flies and moths along with the fleas evolved from the Mecoptera . 
 The origins of insect flight remain obscure , since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers . Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax , for a total of three pairs . As of 2009 , no evidence suggests the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have wings . 
 Late Carboniferous and Early Permian insect orders include both extant groups , their stem groups , and a number of Paleozoic groups , now extinct . During this era , some giant dragonfly @-@ like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70 cm ( 22 to 28 in ) , making them far larger than any living insect . This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today . The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor . Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago . Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian @-@ Triassic extinction event , the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth , around 252 million years ago . 
 The remarkably successful Hymenoptera appeared as long as 146 million years ago in the Cretaceous period , but achieved their wide diversity more recently in the Cenozoic era , which began 66 million years ago . A number of highly successful insect groups evolved in conjunction with flowering plants , a powerful illustration of coevolution . 
 Many modern insect genera developed during the Cenozoic . Insects from this period on are often found preserved in amber , often in perfect condition . The body plan , or morphology , of such specimens is thus easily compared with modern species . The study of fossilized insects is called <unk> . 
 = = = Evolutionary relationships = = = 
 Insects are prey for a variety of organisms , including terrestrial vertebrates . The earliest vertebrates on land existed 400 million years ago and were large amphibious piscivores . Through gradual evolutionary change , <unk> was the next diet type to evolve . 
 Insects were among the earliest terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants . Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects , in turn , evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins . Many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators . Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors . This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics . Over time , this has led to complex groups of coevolved species . Conversely , some interactions between plants and insects , like pollination , are beneficial to both organisms . Coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems . 
 = = = Taxonomy = = = 
 Traditional morphology @-@ based or appearance @-@ based systematics have usually given the Hexapoda the rank of superclass , and identified four groups within it : insects ( <unk> ) , springtails ( Collembola ) , <unk> , and <unk> , the latter three being grouped together as the <unk> on the basis of internalized mouth parts . <unk> relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data . A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic ( where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group ) , with the <unk> classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta . Many of the traditional appearance @-@ based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic , so rather than using ranks like subclass , superorder , and infraorder , it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings ( in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group ) . The following represents the best @-@ supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta . 
 Insects can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses : wingless insects , known as Apterygota , and winged insects , known as Pterygota . The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish ( Thysanura ) . <unk> make up the <unk> based on the shape of their mandibles , while Thysanura and Pterygota are grouped together as <unk> . The Thysanura themselves possibly are not monophyletic , with the family <unk> being a sister group to the <unk> ( Pterygota and the remaining Thysanura ) . 
 <unk> and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called sclerites , and in the Neoptera , muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen . Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis @-@ based ( <unk> and <unk> ) and complete metamorphosis @-@ based groups . It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in <unk> because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa . For example , the <unk> have turned out to be more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota . The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within <unk> has led to the new taxon <unk> . Phasmatodea and <unk> have been suggested to form the <unk> . Mantodea , Blattodea , and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera . 
 The Exopterygota likely are paraphyletic in regard to the Endopterygota . Matters that have incurred controversy include Strepsiptera and Diptera grouped together as <unk> based on a reduction of one of the wing pairs – a position not well @-@ supported in the entomological community . The <unk> are often lumped or split on the whims of the taxonomist . Fleas are now thought to be closely related to <unk> <unk> . Many questions remain in the basal relationships amongst <unk> orders , particularly the Hymenoptera . 
 The study of the classification or taxonomy of any insect is called systematic entomology . If one works with a more specific order or even a family , the term may also be made specific to that order or family , for example systematic <unk> .

 Though the true dimensions of species diversity remain uncertain , estimates range from 2 @.@ 6 – 7 @.@ 8 million species with a mean of 5 @.@ 5 million .

 = = Morphology and physiology = = 
 = = = External = = = 
 Insects have segmented bodies supported by exoskeletons , the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin . The segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units , or tagmata : a head , a thorax and an abdomen . The head supports a pair of sensory antennae , a pair of compound eyes , and , if present , one to three simple eyes ( or ocelli ) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts . The thorax has six segmented legs — one pair each for the prothorax , mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax — and , none , two or four wings . The abdomen consists of eleven segments , though in a few species of insects , these segments may be fused together or reduced in size . The abdomen also contains most of the digestive , respiratory , excretory and reproductive internal structures . Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur , especially wings , legs , antenna and mouthparts . 
 = = = Segmentation = = = 
 The head is enclosed in a hard , heavily sclerotized , unsegmented , exoskeletal head capsule , or <unk> , which contains most of the sensing organs , including the antennae , ocellus or eyes , and the mouthparts . Of all the insect orders , Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects , including the sutures and sclerites . Here , the vertex , or the apex ( dorsal region ) , is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a <unk> and <unk> head . In <unk> insects , the vertex is not found between the compound eyes , but rather , where the ocelli are normally . This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90 ° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body . In some species , this region is modified and assumes a different name . 
 The thorax is a tagma composed of three sections , the prothorax , mesothorax and the metathorax . The anterior segment , closest to the head , is the prothorax , with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum . The middle segment is the mesothorax , with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings . The third and most posterior segment , abutting the abdomen , is the metathorax , which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings . Each segment is <unk> by an <unk> suture . Each segment has four basic regions . The dorsal surface is called the tergum ( or notum ) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga . The two lateral regions are called the pleura ( singular : pleuron ) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum . In turn , the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum , the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum . Continuing with this logic , the <unk> and <unk> , as well as the <unk> and <unk> , are used . 
 The abdomen is the largest tagma of the insect , which typically consists of 11 – 12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax . Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum . <unk> are separated from each other and from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes . Spiracles are located in the pleural area . Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube . Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a <unk> . Ventral sclerites are sometimes called <unk> . During the embryonic stage of many insects and the <unk> stage of primitive insects , 11 abdominal segments are present . In modern insects there is a tendency toward reduction in the number of the abdominal segments , but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis . Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable . If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for <unk> , confusion reigns : adult <unk> have 12 segments , Collembola have 6 . The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments , and a fossil specimen of <unk> has a 10 @-@ segmented abdomen . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 The insect outer skeleton , the cuticle , is made up of two layers : the epicuticle , which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no chitin , and a lower layer called the procuticle . The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers : an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle . The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins , criss @-@ crossing each other in a sandwich pattern , while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened . The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft @-@ bodied insects ( e.g. , caterpillars ) , especially during their larval stages . 
 Insects are the only invertebrates to have developed active flight capability , and this has played an important role in their success . Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse , allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible . Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections ; crustaceans also use the same method , though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs , a system inherited from their pre @-@ arthropod ancestors . Unlike insects , though , most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water . 
 = = = Internal = = = 
 = = = = Nervous system = = = = 
 The nervous system of an insect can be divided into a brain and a ventral nerve cord . The head capsule is made up of six fused segments , each with either a pair of ganglia , or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain . The first three pairs of ganglia are fused into the brain , while the three following pairs are fused into a structure of three pairs of ganglia under the insect 's esophagus , called the subesophageal ganglion . 
 The thoracic segments have one ganglion on each side , which are connected into a pair , one pair per segment . This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments . Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction . Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen , whereas the wasp Vespa <unk> has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen . Some insects , like the house fly Musca domestica , have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion . 
 At least a few insects have <unk> , cells that detect and transmit signals responsible for the sensation of pain . This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to the touch of a heated probe and an unheated one . The larvae reacted to the touch of the heated probe with a stereotypical rolling behavior that was not exhibited when the larvae were touched by the unheated probe . Although <unk> has been demonstrated in insects , there is no consensus that insects feel pain consciously 
 Insects are capable of learning . 
 = = = = Digestive system = = = = 
 An insect uses its digestive system to extract nutrients and other substances from the food it consumes . Most of this food is ingested in the form of macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins , polysaccharides , fats and nucleic acids . These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy , growth , or reproduction . This break @-@ down process is known as digestion . 
 The main structure of an insect 's digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal , which runs lengthwise through the body . The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus . It has three sections , each of which performs a different process of digestion . In addition to the alimentary canal , insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs . These structures usually reside in the thorax , adjacent to the foregut . 
 The salivary glands ( element 30 in numbered diagram ) in an insect 's mouth produce saliva . The salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the <unk> , located behind the hypopharynx . By moving its mouthparts ( element 32 in numbered diagram ) the insect can mix its food with saliva . The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth , where it begins to break down . Some insects , like flies , have extra @-@ oral digestion . Insects using extra @-@ oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down . This strategy allows insects to extract a significant proportion of the available nutrients from the food source . The gut is where almost all of insects ' digestion takes place . It can be divided into the foregut , midgut and hindgut . 
 = = = = = <unk> = = = = = 
 The first section of the alimentary canal is the foregut ( element 27 in numbered diagram ) , or <unk> . The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food . The foregut includes the buccal cavity ( mouth ) , pharynx , esophagus and crop and proventriculus ( any part may be highly modified ) which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut . 
 Digestion starts in buccal cavity ( mouth ) as partially chewed food is broken down by saliva from the salivary glands . As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate @-@ digesting enzymes ( mostly amylases ) , strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity , lubricating the food like the <unk> does , and helping blood feeders , and xylem and phloem feeders . 
 From there , the pharynx passes food to the esophagus , which could be just a simple tube passing it on to the crop and proventriculus , and then onward to the midgut , as in most insects . Alternately , the foregut may expand into a very enlarged crop and proventriculus , or the crop could just be a diverticulum , or fluid @-@ filled structure , as in some Diptera species . 
 = = = = = <unk> = = = = = 
 Once food leaves the crop , it passes to the midgut ( element 13 in numbered diagram ) , also known as the <unk> , where the majority of digestion takes place . Microscopic projections from the midgut wall , called microvilli , increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed ; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut . In some insects , the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary . For example , specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be near the end of the midgut , and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut . 
 = = = = = <unk> = = = = = 
 In the hindgut ( element 16 in numbered diagram ) , or <unk> , undigested food particles are joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets . The rectum absorbs 90 % of the water in these fecal pellets , and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus ( element 17 ) , completing the process of digestion . The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules ( element 20 ) . It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal , at the junction between the midgut and hindgut . The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species , ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others . 
 = = = = Reproductive system = = = = 
 The reproductive system of female insects consist of a pair of ovaries , accessory glands , one or more spermathecae , and ducts connecting these parts . The ovaries are made up of a number of egg tubes , called ovarioles , which vary in size and number by species . The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can be develop being also influenced by <unk> design . Female insects are able make eggs , receive and store sperm , manipulate sperm from different males , and lay eggs . Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance , transport and fertilization , as well as for protection of eggs . They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called <unk> . <unk> are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized . 
 For males , the reproductive system is the testis , suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body . Most male insects have a pair of testes , inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac . The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas <unk> , and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct that leads to the outside . A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle , which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female . The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm . The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and , as a result , has a cuticular lining . The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ , the aedeagus . The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm , except for the germ cells , or spermatogonia , which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis . 
 = = = = Respiratory system = = = = 
 Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs . Instead , the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped , delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea ( element 8 in numbered diagram ) . Since oxygen is delivered directly , the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen , and is therefore greatly reduced . The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries , and instead consists of little more than a single , perforated dorsal tube which pulses <unk> . Toward the thorax , the dorsal tube ( element 14 ) divides into chambers and acts like the insect 's heart . The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph , arthropods ' fluid analog of blood , inside the body cavity . Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles . 
 The respiratory system is an important factor that limits the size of insects . As insects get bigger , this type of oxygen transport gets less efficient and thus the heaviest insect currently weighs less than 100 g . However , with increased atmospheric oxygen levels , as happened in the late Paleozoic , larger insects were possible , such as dragonflies with wingspans of more than two feet . 
 There are many different patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects . Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and <unk> ventilation , to discontinuous gas exchange . During continuous gas exchange , oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle . In discontinuous gas exchange , however , the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest . <unk> ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen . Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration . As larvae , many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water , while others need to rise to the water surface to replenish air supplies which may be held or trapped in special structures . 
 = = = = Circulatory system = = = = 
 The insect circulatory system utilizes hemolymph , a tissue analogous to blood that circulates in the interior of the insect body , while remaining in direct contact with the animal 's tissues . It is composed of plasma in which hemocytes are suspended . In addition to hemocytes , the plasma also contains many chemicals . It is also the major tissue type of the open circulatory system of arthropods , characteristic of spiders , crustaceans and insects . 
 = = Reproduction and development = = 
 The majority of insects hatch from eggs . The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg , enclosed by a shell ( chorion ) that consists of maternal tissue . In contrast to eggs of other arthropods , most insect eggs are drought resistant . This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue , the <unk> and the serosa . This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation . In <unk> however the serosa does not develop , but these flies lay their eggs in damp places , such as rotting matter . Some species of insects , like the cockroach <unk> dubia , as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies , are ovoviviparous . The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female , and then hatch immediately upon being laid . Some other species , such as those in the genus of cockroaches known as <unk> , are viviparous , and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive . Some insects , like parasitic wasps , show <unk> , where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos . Insects may be univoltine , <unk> or <unk> , i.e. they may have one , two or many broods ( generations ) in a year . 
 Other developmental and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy , polymorphism , paedomorphosis or <unk> , sexual dimorphism , parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism . In haplodiploidy , which is a type of sex @-@ determination system , the offspring 's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives . This system is typical in bees and wasps . Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms , as in the oblong winged katydid , which has four different varieties : green , pink and yellow or tan . Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles ; this is called paedomorphosis . In <unk> , an opposite sort of phenomenon , insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults . Many insects display sexual dimorphism , in which males and females have notably different appearances , such as the moth <unk> <unk> as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects . 
 Some insects use parthenogenesis , a process in which the female can reproduce and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male . Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis , called cyclical parthenogenesis , in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction . In summer , aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic ; in the autumn , males may be produced for sexual reproduction . Other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees , wasps and ants , in which they spawn males . However , overall , most individuals are female , which are produced by fertilization . The males are haploid and the females are diploid . More rarely , some insects display hermaphroditism , in which a given individual has both male and female reproductive organs . 
 Insect life @-@ histories show adaptations to withstand cold and dry conditions . Some temperate region insects are capable of activity during winter , while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go into a state of torpor . Still other insects have evolved mechanisms of diapause that allow eggs or pupae to survive these conditions . 
 = = = Metamorphosis = = = 
 Metamorphosis in insects is the biological process of development all insects must undergo . There are two forms of metamorphosis : incomplete metamorphosis and complete metamorphosis . 
 = = = = Incomplete metamorphosis = = = = 
 <unk> insects , those with incomplete metamorphosis , change gradually by undergoing a series of molts . An insect molts when it <unk> its exoskeleton , which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect 's growth . The molting process begins as the insect 's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one . After this new epicuticle is secreted , the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle . When this stage is complete , the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air , which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest . 
 Immature insects that go through incomplete metamorphosis are called nymphs or in the case of dragonflies and damselflies , also naiads . Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence of wings , which are not developed until adulthood . With each molt , nymphs grow larger and become more similar in appearance to adult insects . 
 = = = = Complete metamorphosis = = = = 
 <unk> , or complete metamorphosis , is where the insect changes in four stages , an egg or embryo , a larva , a pupa and the adult or imago . In these species , an egg hatches to produce a larva , which is generally worm @-@ like in form . This worm @-@ like form can be one of several varieties : <unk> ( caterpillar @-@ like ) , <unk> ( grub @-@ like ) , <unk> ( elongated , flattened and active ) , <unk> ( <unk> @-@ like ) or vermiform ( maggot @-@ like ) . The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa , a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon . There are three types of pupae : obtect , exarate or <unk> . <unk> pupae are compact , with the legs and other appendages enclosed . <unk> pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended . <unk> pupae develop inside the larval skin . Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage , and emerge as adults . Butterflies are a well @-@ known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis , although most insects use this life cycle . Some insects have evolved this system to <unk> . 
 Some of the oldest and most successful insect groups , such Endopterygota , use a system of complete metamorphosis . Complete metamorphosis is unique to a group of certain insect orders including Diptera , Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera . This form of development is exclusive and not seen in any other arthropods . 
 = = Senses and communication = = 
 Many insects possess very sensitive and , or specialized organs of perception . Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths , or detect polarized light , while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers . The yellow paper wasp ( Polistes versicolor ) is known for its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony ; it can waggle with a frequency of 10 @.@ 6 ± 2 @.@ 1 Hz ( n = 190 ) . These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions . There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade @-@ off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity , such that most insects with well @-@ developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae , and vice versa . There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound , while the patterns are not universal , insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it . Different insect species can have varying hearing , though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce . Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz . , and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 kHz . Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts , respectively . For instance , some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats , which helps them avoid predation . Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions , and use them to home in on their hosts . 
 Some insects display a rudimentary sense of numbers , such as the solitary wasps that prey upon a single species . The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg with a number of live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched . Some species of wasp always provide five , others twelve , and others as high as twenty @-@ four caterpillars per cell . The number of caterpillars is different among species , but always the same for each sex of larva . The male solitary wasp in the genus Eumenes is smaller than the female , so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars ; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell . 
 = = = Light production and vision = = = 
 A few insects , such as members of the families <unk> and <unk> ( Collembola ) , Mycetophilidae ( Diptera ) and the beetle families Lampyridae , Phengodidae , <unk> and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent . The most familiar group are the fireflies , beetles of the family Lampyridae . Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes . The function varies with some species using them to attract mates , while others use them to lure prey . Cave dwelling larvae of <unk> ( Mycetophilidae , Fungus gnats ) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk . Some fireflies of the genus Photuris mimic the flashing of female Photinus species to attract males of that species , which are then captured and devoured . The colors of emitted light vary from dull blue ( <unk> <unk> , Mycetophilidae ) to the familiar greens and the rare reds ( <unk> <unk> , Phengodidae ) . 
 Most insects , except some species of cave crickets , are able to perceive light and dark . Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements . The eyes may include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes . Many species are able to detect light in the infrared , ultraviolet and the visible light wavelengths . Color vision has been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV @-@ green @-@ blue <unk> existed from at least the Devonian period between 416 and 359 million years ago . 
 = = = Sound production and hearing = = = 
 Insects were the earliest organisms to produce and sense sounds . Insects make sounds mostly by mechanical action of appendages . In grasshoppers and crickets , this is achieved by stridulation . Cicadas make the loudest sounds among the insects by producing and amplifying sounds with special modifications to their body and musculature . The African cicada <unk> brevis has been measured at 106 @.@ 7 decibels at a distance of 50 cm ( 20 in ) . Some insects , such as the Helicoverpa <unk> , hawk moths and <unk> butterflies , can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they sense that they have been detected by bats . Some moths produce ultrasonic clicks that were once thought to have a role in jamming bat echolocation . The ultrasonic clicks were subsequently found to be produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats , just as warning colorations are used against predators that hunt by sight . Some otherwise palatable moths have evolved to mimic these calls . More recently , the claim that some moths can jam bat sonar has been revisited . Ultrasonic recording and high @-@ speed infrared videography of bat @-@ moth interactions suggest the palatable tiger moth really does defend against attacking big brown bats using ultrasonic clicks that jam bat sonar . 
 Very low sounds are also produced in various species of Coleoptera , Hymenoptera , Lepidoptera , Mantodea and Neuroptera . These low sounds are simply the sounds made by the insect 's movement . Through microscopic stridulatory structures located on the insect 's muscles and joints , the normal sounds of the insect moving are amplified and can be used to warn or communicate with other insects . Most sound @-@ making insects also have tympanal organs that can perceive airborne sounds . Some species in Hemiptera , such as the <unk> ( water boatmen ) , are known to communicate via underwater sounds . Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through surfaces . 
 Communication using surface @-@ borne vibrational signals is more widespread among insects because of size constraints in producing air @-@ borne sounds . Insects cannot effectively produce low @-@ frequency sounds , and high @-@ frequency sounds tend to disperse more in a dense environment ( such as foliage ) , so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate @-@ borne vibrations . The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects . 
 Some species use vibrations for communicating within members of the same species , such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug <unk> <unk> . Vibrations can also be used to communicate between entirely different species ; lycaenid ( gossamer @-@ winged butterfly ) caterpillars which are myrmecophilous ( living in a mutualistic association with ants ) communicate with ants in this way . The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression ; the Death 's @-@ head <unk> makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated , which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity . 
 = = = Chemical communication = = = 
 Chemical communications in animals rely on a variety of aspects including taste and smell . <unk> is the physiological response of a sense organ ( i.e. taste or smell ) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell . A <unk> is a message @-@ carrying chemical that is meant to attract , repel , and convey information . Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones . One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation . 
 In addition to the use of sound for communication , a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication . These chemicals , termed semiochemicals , are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract , repel and provide other kinds of information . Pheromones , a type of <unk> , are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex , for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes , for deterring other individuals from approaching , to mark a trail , and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals . <unk> benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver . <unk> benefit their receiver instead of their producer . <unk> benefit the producer and the receiver . While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species , others are used for communication across species . The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects . 
 = = Social behavior = = 
 Social insects , such as termites , ants and many bees and wasps , are the most familiar species of eusocial animal . They live together in large well @-@ organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms . It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates ( and indeed one of the few non @-@ human groups ) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about something in the environment . In this communication system , called dance language , the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun , and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown . Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees , bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors . Bombus terrestris , for example , exhibit a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar , yet rewarding flowers , when they can see a conspecific foraging on the same species . 
 Only insects which live in nests or colonies demonstrate any true capacity for fine @-@ scale spatial orientation or homing . This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together , after a trip of up to several kilometers ' distance . In a phenomenon known as philopatry , insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location up to a year after last viewing the area of interest . A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions ( e.g. , the overwintering areas of the Monarch butterfly ) . 
 = = = Care of young = = = 
 The eusocial insects build nest , guard eggs , and provide food for offspring full @-@ time ( see Eusociality ) . Most insects , however , lead short lives as adults , and rarely interact with one another except to mate or compete for mates . A small number exhibit some form of parental care , where they will at least guard their eggs , and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood , and possibly even feeding them . Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest ( a burrow or an actual construction , either of which may be simple or complex ) , store provisions in it , and lay an egg upon those provisions . The adult does not contact the growing offspring , but it nonetheless does provide food . This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps . 
 = = Locomotion = = 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 Insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight . The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate . Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes , or extensions from the insect 's exoskeleton called the nota , called the paranotal theory . Other theories are based on a pleural origin . These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills , <unk> flaps or as from an appendage of the <unk> . The <unk> theory suggests the insect wings are modified <unk> exites , a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa . In the Carboniferous age , some of the <unk> dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm ( 20 in ) wide wingspan . The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen . The respiratory system of insects constrains their size , however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes . The largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the Atlas moth and the White Witch ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 Insect flight has been a topic of great interest in aerodynamics due partly to the inability of steady @-@ state theories to explain the lift generated by the tiny wings of insects . But insect wings are in motion , with flapping and vibrations , resulting in churning and eddies , and the misconception that physics says " bumblebees can 't fly " persisted throughout most of the twentieth century . 
 Unlike birds , many small insects are swept along by the prevailing winds although many of the larger insects are known to make migrations . Aphids are known to be transported long distances by low @-@ level jet streams . As such , fine line patterns associated with converging winds within weather radar imagery , like the WSR @-@ 88D radar network , often represent large groups of insects . 
 = = = Walking = = = 
 Many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a tripedal gait . The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in cockroaches . The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground . For the first step , the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward , while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position . When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on . The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds . However , this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits . For example , when moving slowly , turning , or avoiding obstacles , four or more feet may be touching the ground . Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs . 
 Cockroaches are among the fastest insect runners and , at full speed , adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size . As cockroaches move very quickly , they need to be video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait . More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks ( Phasmatodea ) . A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water , especially members of the <unk> family , commonly known as water striders . A few species of ocean @-@ skaters in the genus <unk> even live on the surface of open oceans , a habitat that has few insect species . 
 = = = = Use in robotics = = = = 
 Insect walking is of particular interest as an alternative form of locomotion in robots . The study of insects and bipeds has a significant impact on possible robotic methods of transport . This may allow new robots to be designed that can traverse terrain that robots with wheels may be unable to handle . 
 = = = Swimming = = = 
 A large number of insects live either part or the whole of their lives underwater . In many of the more primitive orders of insect , the immature stages are spent in an aquatic environment . Some groups of insects , like certain water beetles , have aquatic adults as well . 
 Many of these species have adaptations to help in under @-@ water locomotion . Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle @-@ like structures . Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion , forcibly expelling water out of their rectal chamber . Some species like the water striders are capable of walking on the surface of water . They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects , but recessed in a special groove further up the leg ; this prevents the claws from piercing the water 's surface film . Other insects such as the Rove beetle <unk> are known to emit <unk> gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion ( also known by the German term <unk> ) . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Insect ecology is the scientific study of how insects , individually or as a community , interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem . Insects play one of the most important roles in their ecosystems , which includes many roles , such as soil turning and aeration , dung burial , pest control , pollination and wildlife nutrition . An example is the beetles , which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms . These insects , and others , are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created . 
 = = = Defense and predation = = = 
 Insects are mostly soft bodied , fragile and almost defenseless compared to other , larger lifeforms . The immature stages are small , move slowly or are immobile , and so all stages are exposed to predation and parasitism . Insects then have a variety of defense strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids . These include camouflage , mimicry , toxicity and active defense . 
 Camouflage is an important defense strategy , which involves the use of coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment . This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families , especially those that feed on wood or vegetation , such as many of the leaf beetles ( family Chrysomelidae ) or weevils . In some of these species , sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects . Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate . Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves , and the bodies of some species ( such as O. <unk> and <unk> <unk> ) are covered in mossy or <unk> outgrowths that supplement their disguise . Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift ( B. <unk> , T. californica ) . In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis , a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze . Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death ( catalepsy ) , where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period . The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators . 
 Another defense that often uses color or shape to deceive potential enemies is mimicry . A number of longhorn beetles ( family <unk> ) bear a striking resemblance to wasps , which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless . Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera . Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species ( the mimic ) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species ( the model ) . Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the <unk> Viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine Monarch . Later research has discovered that the Viceroy is , in fact more toxic than the Monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry . In Müllerian mimicry , inedible species , usually within a taxonomic order , find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects ' inedibility . Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes . 
 Chemical defense is another important defense found amongst species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera , usually being advertised by bright colors , such as the Monarch butterfly . They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues . Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins . Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently , learning not to eat those types of species ; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry . A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future , thus saving many other species as well . Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy , to repel predators . 
 = = = Pollination = = = 
 Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants , thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction . Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation . While other animals are included as pollinators , the majority of pollination is done by insects . Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism . The various flower traits ( and combinations thereof ) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes . These arose through complex plant @-@ animal adaptations . Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations , including ultraviolet , and attractant pheromones . The study of pollination by insects is known as <unk> . 
 = = = Parasitism = = = 
 Many insect are parasites of other insects such as the parasitoid wasps . These insects are known as <unk> parasites . They can be beneficial due to their devastation of pests that can destroy crops and other resources . Many insects have a parasitic relationship with humans such as the mosquito . These insects are known to spread diseases such as malaria and yellow fever and because of such , mosquitoes indirectly cause more deaths of humans than any other animal . 
 = = Relationship to humans = = 
 = = = As pests = = = 
 Many insects are considered pests by humans . Insects commonly regarded as pests include those that are parasitic ( e.g. lice , bed bugs ) , transmit diseases ( mosquitoes , flies ) , damage structures ( termites ) , or destroy agricultural goods ( locusts , weevils ) . Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control , as in research for companies to produce insecticides , but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control , or biocontrol . <unk> uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered a key element of integrated pest management . 
 Despite the large amount of effort focused at controlling insects , human attempts to kill pests with insecticides can backfire . If used carelessly , the poison can kill all kinds of organisms in the area , including insects ' natural predators , such as birds , mice and other insectivores . The effects of DDT 's use exemplifies how some insecticides can threaten wildlife beyond intended populations of pest insects . 
 = = = In beneficial roles = = = 
 Although pest insects attract the most attention , many insects are beneficial to the environment and to humans . Some insects , like wasps , bees , butterflies and ants , pollinate flowering plants . Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects . As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species , they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed . This greatly increases plants ' ability to cross @-@ pollinate , which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness . This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture . As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants . This helps to spread the plants which increases plant diversity . This leads to an overall better environment . A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects , and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field , orchard or greenhouse at bloom time . Another solution , as shown in Delaware , has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. <unk> . Insects also produce useful substances such as honey , wax , lacquer and silk . Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey , although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers . The silkworm has greatly affected human history , as silk @-@ driven trade established relationships between China and the rest of the world . 
 <unk> insects , or insects which feed on other insects , are beneficial to humans because they eat insects that could cause damage to agriculture and human structures . For example , aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers , but ladybugs feed on aphids , and can be used as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations . While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects , insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption . Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates . Without predators to keep them in check , insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions . 
 Insects are also used in medicine , for example fly larvae ( maggots ) were formerly used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene , as they would only consume dead flesh . This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals . Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances . Adult insects , such as crickets and insect larvae of various kinds , are also commonly used as fishing bait . 
 = = = In research = = = 
 Insects play important roles in biological research . For example , because of its small size , short generation time and high fecundity , the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism for studies in the genetics of higher eukaryotes . D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage , interactions between genes , chromosomal genetics , development , behavior and evolution . Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes , understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies can help to understand those processes in other eukaryotes , including humans . The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000 , reflecting the organism 's important role in biological research . It was found that 70 % of the fly genome is similar to the human genome , supporting the evolution theory . 
 = = = As food = = = 
 In some cultures , insects , especially deep @-@ fried cicadas , are considered to be delicacies , whereas in other places they form part of the normal diet . Insects have a high protein content for their mass , and some authors suggest their potential as a major source of protein in human nutrition . In most first @-@ world countries , however , <unk> ( the eating of insects ) , is taboo . Since it is impossible to entirely eliminate pest insects from the human food chain , insects are inadvertently present in many foods , especially grains . Food safety laws in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food , but rather limit their quantity . According to cultural materialist anthropologist Marvin Harris , the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources such as fish or livestock . 
 Due to the abundance of insects and a worldwide concern of food shortages , the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations considers that the world may have to , in the future , regard the prospects of eating insects as a food staple . Insects are noted for their nutrients , having a high content of protein , minerals and fats and are eaten by one @-@ third of the global population . 
 = = = In culture = = = 
 Scarab beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt , Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures . The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality . In Mesopotamian literature , the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to Odonata which signify the impossibility of immortality . Amongst the Aborigines of Australia of the Arrernte language groups , honey ants and <unk> grubs served as personal clan totems . In the case of the ' San ' bush @-@ men of the Kalahari , it is the praying mantis which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen @-@ like patience in waiting .

 SS Samuel Huntington was an American liberty ship during World War II . She was the 248th liberty ship authorized by the United States Maritime Commission and was named in honor of Samuel Huntington , a signer of the American Declaration of Independence . SS Samuel Huntington was launched in 1942 and sailed to ports in the Pacific , South America , Africa , and the United Kingdom . She was one of a select group of liberty ships that were outfitted to carry a limited number of either troops or prisoners of war . As part of a convoy to resupply the Allied troops at Anzio , she sank after a successful German bomb attack in January 1944 .

 Samuel Huntington was laid down on 20 January 1942 by Permanente Metals Corp. on ship way number four at their No. 2 Yard in Richmond , California . She was the 248th liberty ship authorized by the United States Maritime Commission and the 48th ship begun at the ship yard . The Huntington — a type <unk> @-@ S @-@ C1 , or standard , liberty ship — was launched on 26 April , and delivered on 18 May . She was completed in 118 days , spending 96 on the ways and 22 on the water before delivery . She was one of about 220 liberty ships , about one out of every 10 made , that were outfitted to carry a limited number of either troops or prisoners of war . Sources are not clear when the passenger capability was added to Samuel Huntington , but modifications of this sort were made after November 1942 .

 Ten days after her delivery , Samuel Huntington departed San Francisco for Los Angeles . Sailing from that port on 31 May 1942 , she arrived at Suva in the Fiji Islands on 19 June . After the Huntington made her way to Lautoka , she departed there on 6 July for Chile . After arriving at Antofagasta on 29 July , the cargo ship worked her way up and down the South American coast , calling at Iquique on 30 July , Valparaiso on 7 August , and Punta Arenas on 13 August . Sailing from Punta Arenas the next day , she navigated the Straits of Magellan , crossed the South Atlantic , and arrived at Cape Town , South Africa , on 2 September . 
 Sailing from Cape Town on 6 September , Samuel Huntington sailed around the African continent , calling at Durban on 10 September , and arriving at Aden , on the Arabian peninsula , in mid September . Departing there on 24 September , the Huntington sailed up the Red Sea , calling at <unk> on the Eritrean coast on 26 September and Suez on 1 October . Departing Suez on 12 October , she retraced her track around Africa , calling at Port Sudan on 18 October , Durban on 2 November , Cape Town on 7 November . Leaving the same day , she crossed the South Atlantic and headed for Paramaribo , Suriname . 
 Samuel Huntington arrived at Paramaribo on 27 November , and sailed three days later for Trinidad . After arriving at that Caribbean port on 1 December , the Huntington waited for a week before sailing in convoy TAG @-@ 27 to Guantanamo Bay with 12 other ships . After arriving at Guantanamo Bay on 12 December , the convoy , dropping four ships , reformed as convoy <unk> headed for New York City and departed the same day . The Huntington , calling at a U.S. port for the first time in seven months , arrived at New York on 19 December . 
 The Huntington departed New York as a part of Convoy SC @-@ 118 headed for Liverpool via Halifax on 24 January . As the convoy , which consisted of 60 ships and 26 escorts , sailed near Iceland , a wolf pack of Kriegsmarine U @-@ Boats attacked the convoy repeatedly over a four @-@ day period . Some 20 U @-@ boats participated , sinking 12 Allied ships , including Henry R. Mallory , a troop transport that went down with 272 men — more than half of her passengers and crew ; three U @-@ boats were lost . Samuel Huntington departed the convoy and arrived at Clyde on 11 February . 
 After calling at Belfast Lough in early April , Samuel Huntington made her way to Liverpool to join Convoy ON 181 to New York . Departing on 30 April as one of 48 merchant ships in the convoy , the liberty ship made port at New York on 17 May . The convoy reported no submarine activity , and about two @-@ thirds of the convoy were able to take target practice on icebergs during the voyage . 
 Samuel Huntington next departed New York on 13 June for Oran as a part of Convoy UGS @-@ 10 . Joining 74 other merchant ships and their 28 escorts , the Huntington made it safely to Oran on 5 July ; another ship in the convoy was sunk by a U @-@ boat . During her participation in Operation Husky , the Allied invasion of Sicily , the Huntington and fellow liberty ships William W. Gerhard and William Mulholland all suffered casualties from an air attack on 1 August at Palermo . Damage to the ship was apparently minor enough that she was ready to sail nine days later , when she joined Convoy GUS @-@ 12 — which had originated in Alexandria and was destined for Hampton Roads , Virginia — to return to the United States . Samuel Huntington left the convoy as it neared the U.S. east coast , and headed for New York , arriving there on 5 September . 
 After making her way to Hampton Roads , Samuel Huntington departed for Casablanca on 5 October as part of Convoy UGS @-@ 20 , where she arrived on 21 October . Eight days later , she joined Convoy GUS @-@ 19 — a 110 @-@ ship Alexandria – Hampton Roads convoy — and headed for home . She arrived in Baltimore on 16 November . Shifting to Hampton Roads in early December , Samuel Huntington prepared to depart on what would be her last sailing from the United States . 
 The Huntington — in Convoy UGS @-@ 27 , a 115 @-@ ship convoy — sailed from Hampton Roads on 15 December for Oran , arriving there on 3 January 1944 . She departed from Oran on 16 January and arrived at Naples five days later . One week later , Samuel Huntington sailed to Anzio where she anchored one @-@ quarter mile ( 400 m ) off the beach on 29 January with 7 @,@ 181 long tons ( 7 @,@ 296 t ) of cargo , including ammunition , canned gasoline and TNT . 
 = = = Sinking = = = 
 At sunset on 29 January , Luftwaffe bombers planes armed with Henschel Hs 293 anti @-@ shipping guided missiles attacked the ships at anchor off Anzio . British cruiser Spartan was hit amidships and rolled over on her port side and sank with a loss of 65 men . Soon after Spartan was hit , another Hs 293 slammed into Samuel Huntington , penetrating to her boiler room before exploding and killing four men . The force of the explosion blew out two of her cargo hatches , launching a jeep into the stricken ship 's flying bridge in the process . With no power , and , hence , no way of fighting the fire , Samuel Huntington 's master ordered the ship abandoned , and the crew lowered her lifeboats and headed away from the ship . Fifteen minutes after the bomb 's blast , another explosion rocked the ship , throwing a cloud of debris over 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) in the air , and raining shrapnel on ships as far as 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) away . 
 After the second explosion , Samuel Huntington settled to the bottom , but because the bottom had been only 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) below her keel , most of the ship remained above the water . U.S. Navy salvage ship Weight came alongside the Huntington and trained two deck water guns and a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 6 @.@ 4 cm ) water hose to douse the fires . When the task seemed accomplished , Weight pulled away . The fires flared up again four hours later and Weight returned to fight the conflagration again . After tending to other ships damaged during the raid , Weight returned a third time . By the early morning hours on 30 January , any hope of salvaging Samuel Huntington or her cargo ended when the fires reached her load of canned gasoline . The resulting explosion completely destroyed the ship and again rained shrapnel on nearby ships . When the smoke cleared , no trace of the Huntington remained .

In October 2002 , she was hired by the WWF , now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . She spent eight months training in their then @-@ developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) and wrestled house shows and dark matches before being called up to their main roster . After several weeks of vignettes showcasing Matrix @-@ like effects aired on Raw , Kim debuted on June 30 as a fan favorite , with a Matrix @-@ inspired outfit . 
 Her first televised WWE match was a seven @-@ woman battle royal on the June 30 , 2003 episode of Raw with the WWE Women 's Championship , then held by an injured Jazz , on the line . Kim won the match by lastly eliminating Victoria . Kim held the title for four weeks , successfully defending it once against Molly Holly , before losing it to Holly on the July 28 episode of Raw . The following week , Kim turned heel on Trish Stratus , which stemmed from a previous Raw episode where Stratus cost Kim and herself a tag match against Victoria and Holly ; Kim subsequently formed an alliance with Holly to take on Stratus , defeating her and various partners on several occasions , until Stratus was later assisted by Lita . At WWE 's Unforgiven pay @-@ per @-@ view event on September 21 , Stratus and Lita defeated Kim and Holly in a tag team match . The four women continued to feud until November , when Kim was sidelined with a broken right collarbone . 
 Kim returned to Raw in April 2004 and immediately <unk> her alliance with Holly . In May 2004 , Kim submitted then @-@ Women 's Champion Victoria twice , in singles match and a six @-@ woman tag match , earning herself a title shot at Bad Blood .

 = Cuthbert of Canterbury = 
 Cuthbert ( died 26 October 760 ) was a medieval Anglo @-@ Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury in England . Prior to his elevation to Canterbury , he was abbot of a monastic house , and perhaps may have been Bishop of Hereford also , but evidence for his holding Hereford mainly dates from after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 . While Archbishop , he held church councils and built a new church in Canterbury . It was during Cuthbert 's archbishopric that the Diocese of York was raised to an archbishopric . Cuthbert died in 760 and was later regarded as a saint . 
 = = Early life and Hereford = = 
 Of noble birth , Cuthbert is first recorded as the Abbot of Lyminge , from where he was elevated to the See of Hereford in 736 . The identification of the Cuthbert who was Bishop of Hereford with the Cuthbert who became archbishop , however , comes from Florence of Worcester and other post @-@ Conquest sources . The contemporary record in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle says that Cuthbert was consecrated archbishop , where if he had been Bishop of Hereford , he would have been translated . No consecration is needed when a bishop is translated from one see to another . Given the nature of the sources , the identification of the bishop of Hereford with the archbishop of Canterbury , while likely , must not be regarded as proven . 
 If Cuthbert was at Hereford , he served in that capacity for four years before his elevation to the See of Canterbury in 740 . He is credited with the composition of an epitaph for the tomb of his three predecessors at Hereford . The cathedral church of the see may not even have been located at Hereford by Cuthbert 's time . 
 Whoever Cuthbert was prior to his election to Canterbury , he probably owed his selection as archbishop to the influence of Æthelbald , King of Mercia . A number of Mercians were appointed to Canterbury during the 730s and 740s , which suggests that Mercian authority was expanding into Kent . 
 = = Canterbury = = 
 Cuthbert was the recipient of a long letter from Boniface who complained about the lax morals of the clergy in the British Isles , and too much drinking of alcohol by the Anglo @-@ Saxon bishops . Cuthbert also sent letters to Lull who was Archbishop of Mainz and a native of England . During Cuthbert 's time as archbishop he no longer claimed authority over all of Britain , like his predecessor Theodore . Pope Gregory III in 735 had sent a pallium to the bishop of York , raising the see of York to the status of an archbishopric . As a sign of the enhanced status of York , Cuthbert only consecrated bishops south of the Humber and his synods were attended only by bishops from the south of England . 
 Cuthbert presided over the Council of Clovesho in 747 along with Æthelbald of Mercia . This gathering mandated that all clergy should explain the basic tenets of Christianity to the laity , as well as legislating on clerical dress , control of monasteries , and the behavior of the clergy . It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod to proclaim the decisions of the council . Cuthbert sent his deacon <unk> to Pope Gregory III after the council with a report on the council and its resolutions . This action may have been taken in response to Boniface 's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy . The actions of the council were also gathered into a collection at Cuthbert 's command . 
 After the council , Cuthbert continued to correspond with Boniface up until Boniface 's martyrdom in 754 , and then sent condolences to Boniface 's successor . Cuthbert held a second synod in 758 , but nothing is known of any enactments it made . He also built the church of St. John the Baptist in Canterbury , which was destroyed by fire in 1067 . He was buried in his new church . The new church was located on the west side of the cathedral , and was used as a baptistery . The church also became a burial site for many of the archbishops , and later was used for trials by ordeal . There is no explicit contemporary reference that states that these uses were intended by Cuthbert , but the fact that the church was dedicated to St. John the Baptist argues strongly that Cuthbert at least intended the new building as a baptistery . 
 The burial practices of the archbishops did change after Cuthbert , but it is not clear whether this was intended by Cuthbert , as a Post @-@ Conquest Canterbury cartulary has it , or due to other reasons , unconnected with Cuthbert . Although Sonia Hawkes argues that the change in burial customs , which extended over most of Britain , resulted from Cuthbert 's mandating burial in church yards , instead of outside the city limits as had been the custom previously . However , the main evidence for this theory is a 16th @-@ century tradition at Canterbury and the archaeological evidence of a change in burial patterns . Although a change did occur , the archaeological evidence does not give a reason why this change happened , and given the late date of the Canterbury tradition , the theory cannot be considered proven . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Cuthbert died on 26 October 760 , and was later considered a saint with a feast day of 26 October . He was buried in his church of St. John , and was the first Archbishop of Canterbury that was not buried in St Augustine 's Abbey . His letters to the Anglo @-@ Saxon missionaries on the European continent show him to have been highly educated . 
 = Gerðr = 
 In Norse mythology , Gerðr ( Old Norse " fenced @-@ in " ) is a jötunn , goddess , and the wife of the god Freyr . Gerðr is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources ; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson ; and in the poetry of skalds . Gerðr is sometimes modernly anglicized as Gerd or Gerth . 
 In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda , Freyr sees Gerðr from a distance , becomes deeply lovesick at the sight of her shimmering beauty , and has his servant Skírnir go to Jötunheimr ( where Gerðr and her father Gymir reside ) to gain her love . In the Poetic Edda Gerðr initially refuses , yet after a series of threats by Skírnir she finally agrees . In the Prose Edda , no mention of threats are made . In both sources , Gerðr agrees to meet Freyr at a fixed time at the location of Barri and , after Skírnir returns with Gerðr 's response , Freyr laments that the meeting could not occur sooner . In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda , Gerðr is described as the daughter of Gymir and the mountain jötunn Aurboða . 
 In Heimskringla , Gerðr is recorded as the wife of Freyr , euhemerized as having been a beloved king of Sweden . In the same source , the couple are the founders of the <unk> dynasty and produced a son , <unk> , who rose to <unk> after Freyr 's passing and continued their line . Gerðr is commonly theorized to be a goddess associated with the earth . Gerðr inspired works of art and literature .

 Gerðr is attested in two poems in the Poetic Edda , in two books of the Prose Edda , and in two books in Heimskringla .

 In the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál , the god Freyr sat on the high seat <unk> and looked into all worlds . Freyr saw a beautiful girl walking from the hall of her father to a storehouse . Freyr became heartsick for the girl . Freyr has a page named Skírnir . Freyr 's father Njörðr and , in verse , the goddess Skaði tells Skírnir to find out what troubles Freyr . An exchange occurs between Freyr and Skírnir in verse , where Freyr tells Skírnir that he has seen a wondrous girl with shining arms at the home of ( her father ) Gymir , yet that the gods and elves do not wish for the two to be together : 
 Skírnir requests that Freyr give him a horse and Freyr 's sword ; a sword which fights jötnar by itself . Under the cover of darkness , Skírnir rides the horse over nations and dew @-@ covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr , the home of the jötnar , and proceeds to Gymir 's courts . Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden fence that surrounds Gerðr 's hall . Skírnir rides out to a herdsman ( unnamed ) sitting on a mound , greets him , and asks the herdsman how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir 's dogs . An exchange occurs between the herdsman and Skírnir , during which the herdsman tells Skírnir that he will never speak to the girl . 
 Hearing a terrible noise in her dwellings , Gerðr asks where it is coming from , noting that the earth trembles and that all of Gymir 's courts shake . A serving maid ( unnamed ) notes that outside a man has dismounted his horse and has let it graze . Gerðr tells the serving maid to invite the man to come into their hall and to partake of some of their " famous mead , " yet Gerðr expresses fear that the man outside may be her " brother 's slayer " . 
 Gerðr asks the stranger if he is of the elves , Æsir , or the Vanir , and why he comes alone " over the wild fire " to seek their company . Skírnir responds that he is of none of these groups , yet that he has indeed sought her out . Skírnir offers Gerðr 11 golden apples ( or apples of eternal life , in a common emendation ) to gain her favor . Gerðr rejects the apples — no matter who offers them — and adds that neither will she and Freyr be together as long as they live . Skírnir offers Gerðr a ring , here unnamed , that produces eight more gold rings every ninth night and " was burned with Odin 's young son " . Gerðr responds that she is not interested in the ring , for she shares her father 's property , and Gymir has no lack of gold . 
 = = = = Threats = = = = 
 Skírnir turns to threats ; he points out to Gerðr that he holds a sword in his hand and he threatens to cut her head from her neck unless she agrees . Gerðr refuses ; she says that she will not endure the coercion of any man , and says that if Gymir encounters Skírnir then a battle can be expected . Skírnir again reminds Gerðr of his blade and predicts that Gerðr 's jötunn father will meet his doom with it . Skírnir warns Gerðr that he will strike her with his <unk> , a wand , that it will tame her to his desires , and says that she will never again be seen by " the sons of men " . From early morning , Gerðr will sit on an eagle 's mound , looking outward to the world , facing Hel , and that " food shall be more hateful to you than to every man is the shining serpent among men " . 
 Skírnir declares that when Gerðr comes out she will be a spectacle ; <unk> will " glare " at her , " everything " will stare at her , she will become more famous than the watchman of the gods , and that she will " gape through the bars " . Gerðr will experience " madness and howling , tearing affliction and unbearable desire " and that , in grief , tears will flow from her . Skírnir tells Gerðr to sit down , for her fate will be even worse yet . She will be harassed by fiends all her weary days . From the court of jötnar to the halls of the hrimthurs , Gerðr shall everyday crawl without choice , nor hope of choice . Gerðr will weep rather than feel joy , suffering tearfully . She will live the rest of her life in misery with a three @-@ headed thurs or otherwise be without a man altogether . Skírnir commands for Gerðr 's mind to be seized , that she may waste away with pining , and that she be as the thistle at the end of the harvest ; crushed . 
 Skírnir says that he has been to a wood to get a " potent branch " , which he found . He declares that the gods Odin and Thor are angry with Gerðr , and that Freyr will hate her ; she has " brought down the potent wrath of the gods " . Skírnir declares to the <unk> , <unk> , the sons of <unk> , and the " troops of the Æsir " that he has denied both pleasure and benefit from men to Gerðr . Skírnir details that the thurs 's name who will own her below the gates of <unk> is <unk> and that there , at the roots of the world , the finest thing Gerðr will be given to drink is the urine of goats . He carves " thurs " ( the runic character * <unk> ) on Gerðr and three runes ( unnamed ) symbolizing lewdness , frenzy , and unbearable desire , and comments that he can rub them off just as he has carved them — if he wishes . 
 Gerðr responds with a welcome to Skírnir and tells him to take a crystal cup containing ancient mead , noting that she thought she would never love one of the Vanir . Skírnir asks her when she will meet with Freyr . Gerðr says that they shall meet at a tranquil location called Barri , and that after nine nights she will there grant Freyr her love : 
 Skírnir rides home . Standing outside , Freyr immediately greets Skírnir and asks for news . Skírnir tells him that Gerðr says she will meet with him at Barri . Freyr , impatient , comments that one night is long , as is two nights , and questions how he will bear three , noting that frequently a month seemed shorter than half a night before being with Gerðr . 
 A stanza in the poem Lokasenna refers to Gerðr . In the poem , Loki accuses the god Freyr of having purchased Gymir 's daughter ( Gerðr ) with gold and comments that , in the process , Freyr gave away his sword . Referring to Freyr as a " wretch " , Loki then posits how Freyr intends to fight when the Sons of Muspell ride over the wood <unk> ( an event during Ragnarök ) . Freyr 's servant , <unk> , interjects and the poem continues . 
 In the poem Hyndluljóð , Óttar 's ancestry is recounted and information is provided about the gods . One stanza that actually belongs to Völuspá hin skamma relates that Freyr and Gerðr were married , that Gerðr is the daughter of the jötunn Gymir , that Gerðr 's mother is Aurboða , and that they are related to Þjazi ( the nature of the kinship is not specified ) — father of the goddess and jötunn Skaði . 
 = = = Prose Edda = = = 
 In chapter 37 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning , Gerðr is introduced by the enthroned figure of High as the daughter of Gymir and the mountain jötunn Aurboða , and is described as " the most beautiful of all women " . High reports that Freyr went into <unk> and looked over all worlds . When Freyr looked to the north he saw a distant homestead with a large and magnificent building . A woman went to the building , and when she lifted her arms and opened the door to the building " light was shed from her arms over both sky and sea , and all worlds were made bright by her " . In punishment for " his great presumption " in having sat in the holy seat , Freyr went away filled with grief . 
 Freyr arrives home and neither sleeps nor drinks , remaining in silence . No one dares speak to him . The god Njörðr sends Freyr 's servant Skírnir to speak to Freyr . Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman , so beautiful that he was filled with grief and that he would soon die if he could not have her . Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf — whether the woman 's father agrees or not — and he will be rewarded . Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr 's sword , which can fight on its own . Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off . Skírnir asks for the woman 's hand for Freyr and receives her promise . Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called <unk> . Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál , lamenting that he must wait . 
 At the beginning of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál , eight goddesses are listed as attending a feast held by Ægir on the island of <unk> ( modernly Læsø , Denmark ) , including Gerðr . In chapter 19 , different ways of referring to the goddess Frigg are provided . One of these names is " rival of Gerðr " ; however , this is probably a scribal error ( see " Theories " section below ) . In chapter 57 , various goddesses are listed , including Gerðr ( between Snotra and Gefjon ) . 
 = = = Heimskringla = = = 
 In chapter 12 of Ynglinga saga ( as collected in Heimskringla ) , an euhemerized prose account relates that Freyr was a much loved king in what is now Sweden . Freyr 's wife was Gerðr and their son was <unk> . Gerðr 's fate is not provided , but after Freyr 's death their son goes on to become king and their family line , the Ynglings , continues . In a verse stanza found in chapter 16 of <unk> saga <unk> , Gerðr is mentioned in a kenning for " woman " ( " Gerðr @-@ of @-@ gold @-@ rings " ) . 
 = = Archaeological record = = 
 Small pieces of gold foil featuring engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age ( known as gullgubber ) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia , almost 2 @,@ 500 at one location . The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings , only rarely in graves . The figures are sometimes single , occasionally an animal , sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them , facing or embracing one another . The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent . Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance , and that they may have been connected with weddings , as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods , representing the notion of a divine marriage , such as in the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál ; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr .

 = = = " Rival of Frigg " = = = 
 In chapter 19 of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál , Gerðr is listed among " rivals " of the goddess Frigg , a list of sexual partners of Frigg 's husband , Odin . Instead of Gerðr , the jötunn Gríðr , mother of Odin 's son Víðarr according to the Prose Edda , was probably intended . One manuscript has Gríðr corrected to Gerðr . Andy Orchard notes that it may nonetheless be an intentional inclusion in view of " Odin 's notorious appetites " . 
 = = = Earth and fertility = = = 
 Scholar John Lindow comments that Gerðr 's name has been etymologically associated with the earth and enclosures and that the wedding of Gerðr and Freyr is commonly seen as " the divine coupling of sky and earth or at least fertility god and representative of the soil . " Lindow adds that , at the same time , the situation can be read as simply the gods getting what they want from the jötnar . 
 Hilda Ellis Davidson comments that Gerðr 's role in Skírnismál has parallels with the goddess Persephone from Greek mythology , " since it is made clear that if [ Gerðr ] remains below in the dark kingdom of the underworld there will be nothing to hope for but sterility and famine . She does not become the bride of the underworld , however ; her bridal is to be in the upper world when she consents to meet Freyr at Barri . "

 Gerðr has inspired works of art and literature . The Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger wrote a series of poems referencing Gerðr as collected in ( 1819 ) Nordens Guder . <unk> <unk> 's ( 1782 – 1846 ) unfinished epic poem Gerda also references the goddess . K. Ehrenberg depicted the goddess in his illustration ( 1883 ) Freyr und Gerda , Skade und Niurd . 
 = New York State Route 9M = 
 New York State Route 9M ( NY 9M ) was a state highway in Warren County , New York , in the United States . It was a spur route of U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) that largely followed the eastern bank of the Schroon River . The southern terminus of the route was at NY 8 in the town of Horicon near the hamlet of Starbuckville . Its northern terminus was at US 9 in the Chester hamlet of Pottersville . NY 9M was known as East Schroon River Road and Glendale Road and crossed over the southern tip of Schroon Lake . 
 NY 9M was assigned c . 1931 to what had been designated as legislative Route 22 @-@ c from 1913 to 1921 . It lasted for less than a decade as it was removed c . 1939 . Its former routing is now maintained by Warren County as part of three county routes , namely County Route 55 ( CR 55 ) , CR 62 , and County Route 64 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 9M began at an intersection with NY 8 ( now CR 53 ) north of the hamlet of Starbuckville in the town of Horicon . The route followed Valentine Pond Road north for a negligible distance , then progressed westward along the eastern bank of the Schroon River on East Schroon River Road . Across the river , Carl Turner Road , a locally maintained highway , followed a routing parallel to that of NY 9M on the other shore . Both roads gradually curved northward , mirroring a similar turn in the river 's course . Carl Turner Road came to an end here ; however , NY 9M continued on . Near a junction with modern @-@ day Short Street , NY 9M began to deviate from the river . 
 North of Short Street , NY 9M curved back to the northwest , passing Smith Pond and traveling through woodlands as it approached Schroon Lake . It then crossed over the southern tip of the lake and entered the town of Chester on the opposite bank . The route came to an end shortly afterward at a junction with US 9 in the hamlet of Pottersville .

 In 1913 , the New York State Legislature created Route 22 @-@ c , an unsigned legislative route extending 4 @.@ 80 miles ( 7 @.@ 72 km ) from State Highway 1023 ( later NY 8 and now CR 53 ) near Starbuckville to legislative Route 22 ( modern US 9 ) in Pottersville . The Route 22 @-@ c designation was eliminated on March 1 , 1921 , as part of a partial renumbering of New York 's legislative route system . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , hundreds of state @-@ maintained highways that did not have a signed designation were assigned one . The former routing of legislative Route 22 @-@ c was designated as NY 9M by the following year . NY 9M was short @-@ lived , however , as it ceased to exist c . 1939 . Its former routing is now maintained by Warren County as CR 55 from former NY 8 ( CR 53 ) to East Schroon River Road , CR 64 from Valentine Pond Road to East Shore Road , and CR 62 from East Shore Road to US 9 .

 = Japanese ironclad Kongō = 
 Kongō ( 金剛 , Kongō ) was the lead ship of the Kongō @-@ class ironclad corvettes built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the 1870s . The class was built in the United Kingdom because such ships could not yet be constructed in Japan . Completed in 1878 , Kongō briefly served with the Small Standing Fleet before becoming a training ship in 1887 , thereafter making training cruises to the Mediterranean and to countries on the edge of the Pacific Ocean . The ship returned to active duty during the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 where she participated in the Battle of Weihaiwei . Kongō resumed her training duties after the war , though she also played a minor role in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 . The ship was reclassified as a survey ship in 1906 and was sold for scrap in 1910 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 During the brief Japanese occupation of Taiwan in 1874 , tensions heightened between China and Japan , and the possibility of war impressed on the Japanese government the need to reinforce its navy . The following year the government placed an order for the armored frigate Fusō and the Kongō @-@ class corvettes Kongō and Hiei — with British shipyards as no Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size . All three ships were designed by British naval architect Sir Edward Reed , 
 The contract for Kongō was awarded to Earle 's Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in Hull , England on 24 September 1875 for the price of £ 120 @,@ 750 , exclusive of armament . The vessel was named for Mount Kongō . 
 Kongō was 220 feet ( 67 @.@ 1 m ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 41 feet ( 12 @.@ 5 m ) . She had a forward draft of 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) and drew 19 feet ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) aft . The ship displaced 2 @,@ 248 long tons ( 2 @,@ 284 t ) and had a crew of 22 officers and 212 enlisted men . Her hull was of composite construction with an iron framework planked with wood . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Kongō had a single two @-@ cylinder double @-@ expansion horizontal return connecting @-@ rod steam engine , driving a single propeller using steam from six cylindrical boilers . The engine was designed to produce 2 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 900 kW ) to give the Kongō @-@ class ironclads a speed of 13 @.@ 5 knots ( 25 @.@ 0 km / h ; 15 @.@ 5 mph ) . During her sea trials on 7 December 1877 , the ship reached a maximum speed of 13 @.@ 73 knots ( 25 @.@ 43 km / h ; 15 @.@ 80 mph ) from 2 @,@ 450 ihp ( 1 @,@ 830 kW ) , enough to earn the builder a bonus of £ 300 . She carried enough coal to steam 3 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 700 km ; 3 @,@ 600 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ironclad was barque @-@ rigged and had a sail area of 14 @,@ 036 square feet ( 1 @,@ 304 m2 ) . The ship was reboilered at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in 1889 ; the new boilers proved to be less powerful during sea trials , with Kongō reaching a maximum speed of 12 @.@ 46 knots ( 23 @.@ 08 km / h ; 14 @.@ 34 mph ) from 2 @,@ 028 ihp ( 1 @,@ 512 kW ) . Her topmasts were removed in 1895 .
