 Sebille was posthumously presented the Medal of Honor in a ceremony at March Air Force Base in Riverside County , California , on August 24 , 1951 . Air Force Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg presented the medal for him to his widowed wife and their son , who was 19 months old at the time . The ceremony was also attended by his former wingman in Korea , Martin Johnson , who made a speech calling Sebille " a remarkable friend , a fine commander and a very brave man . " 
 Sebille was the first person in the U.S. Air Force to be awarded the Medal of Honor since the branch 's beginning in 1947 , and the 31st MOH recipient of the Korea War . The Four U.S. Air Force members including <unk> who received the medal in that war were pilots who were killed in action . They were the only USAF members to receive the Army version of the medal ( the Air Force version was first awarded during the Vietnam War ) . His Medal of honor citation reads :

 Maj. Sebille , distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty . During an attack on a camouflaged area containing a concentration of enemy troops , artillery , and armored vehicles , Maj. Sebille 's F @-@ 51 aircraft was severely damaged by antiaircraft fire . Although fully cognizant of the short period he could remain airborne , he deliberately ignored the possibility of survival by abandoning the aircraft or by crash landing , and continued his attack against the enemy forces threatening the security of friendly ground troops . In his determination to inflict maximum damage upon the enemy , Maj. Sebille again exposed himself to the intense fire of enemy gun batteries and dived on the target to his death . The superior leadership , daring , and selfless devotion to duty which he displayed in the execution of an extremely dangerous mission were an inspiration to both his subordinates and superiors and reflect the highest credit upon himself , the U.S. Air Force , and the armed forces of the United Nations . 
 = <unk> complex = 
 The exosome complex ( or PM / Scl complex , often just called the exosome ) is a multi @-@ protein intracellular complex capable of degrading various types of RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) molecules . <unk> complexes are found in both eukaryotic cells and archaea , while in bacteria a simpler complex called the degradosome carries out similar functions . 
 The core of the exosome contains a six @-@ membered ring structure to which other proteins are attached . In eukaryotic cells , the exosome complex is present in the cytoplasm , nucleus and especially the nucleolus , although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to substrates specific to these cell compartments . Substrates of the exosome include messenger RNA , ribosomal RNA , and many species of small RNAs . The exosome has an <unk> function , meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end ( the 3 ′ end in this case ) , and in eukaryotes also an <unk> function , meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule . 
 Several proteins in the exosome are the target of autoantibodies in patients with specific autoimmune diseases ( especially the PM / Scl overlap syndrome ) and some <unk> chemotherapies for cancer function by blocking the activity of the exosome . In addition , mutations in exosome component 3 cause <unk> hypoplasia and spinal motor neuron disease . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The exosome was first discovered as an RNase in 1997 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , an often @-@ used model organism . Not long after , in 1999 , it was realized that the exosome was in fact the yeast equivalent of an already described complex in human cells called the PM / Scl complex , which had been identified as an <unk> in patients with certain autoimmune diseases years earlier ( see below ) . Purification of this " PM / Scl complex " allowed the identification of more human exosome proteins and eventually the characterization of all components in the complex . In 2001 , the increasing amount of genome data that had become available allowed the prediction of exosome proteins in archaea , although it would take another 2 years before the first exosome complex from an archaeal organism was purified . 
 = = Structure = = 
 = = = Core proteins = = = 
 The core of the complex has a ring structure consisting of six proteins that all belong to the same class of RNases , the RNase PH @-@ like proteins . In archaea there are two different PH @-@ like proteins ( called Rrp41 and <unk> ) , each present three times in an alternating order . Eukaryotic exosome complexes have six different proteins that form the ring structure . Of these six eukaryotic proteins , three resemble the archaeal Rrp41 protein and the other three proteins are more similar to the archaeal <unk> protein . 
 Located on top of this ring are three proteins that have an S1 RNA binding domain ( RBD ) . Two proteins in addition have a K @-@ homology ( KH ) domain . In eukaryotes , three different " S1 " proteins are bound to the ring , whereas in archaea either one or two different " S1 " proteins can be part of the exosome ( although there are always three S1 subunits attached to the complex ) . 
 This ring structure is very similar to that of the proteins RNase PH and PNPase . In bacteria , the protein RNase PH , which is involved in tRNA processing , forms a hexameric ring consisting of six identical RNase PH proteins . In the case of PNPase , which is a phosphorolytic RNA @-@ degrading protein found in bacteria and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some eukaryotic organisms , two RNase PH domains , and both an S1 and KH RNA binding domain are part of a single protein , which forms a trimeric complex that adopts a structure almost identical to that of the exosome . Because of this high similarity in both protein domains and structure , these complexes are thought to be evolutionarily related and have a common ancestor . In bacteria , a separate RNase PH protein exists that is involved in transfer RNA processing , which has been shown to adopt a similar six @-@ membered ring structure , but in this case consisting of 6 identical protein subunits . The RNase PH @-@ like exosome proteins , PNPase and RNase PH all belong to the RNase PH family of RNases and are phosphorolytic <unk> , meaning that they use inorganic phosphate to remove nucleotides from the 3 ' end of RNA molecules . 
 = = = Associated proteins = = = 
 Besides these nine core exosome proteins , two other proteins often associate with the complex in eukaryotic organisms . One of these is Rrp44 , a hydrolytic RNase , which belongs to the RNase R family of hydrolytic <unk> ( nucleases that use water to cleave the nucleotide bonds ) . In addition to being an <unk> enzyme , Rrp44 also has <unk> activity , which resides in a separate domain of the protein . In yeast , Rrp44 is associated with all exosome complexes and has a crucial role in the activity of the yeast exosome complex . While a human homologue of the protein exists , no evidence was found for a long time that its human homologue was associated with the human exosome complex . In 2010 , however , it was discovered that humans have three Rrp44 homologues and two of these can be associated with the exosome complex . These two proteins most likely degrade different RNA substrates due to their different cellular localization , with one being localized in the cytoplasm ( Dis3L1 ) and the other in the nucleus ( Dis3 ) . 
 The second common associated protein is called Rrp6 ( in yeast ) or PM / Scl @-@ 100 ( in human ) . Like Rrp44 , this protein is a hydrolytic exoribonuclease , but in this case of the RNase D protein family . The protein PM / Scl @-@ 100 is most commonly part of exosome complexes in the nucleus of cells , but can form part of the cytoplasmic exosome complex as well . 
 = = = Regulatory proteins = = = 
 Apart from these two tightly bound protein subunits , many proteins interact with the exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells . These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome complex . In the cytoplasm , the exosome interacts with AU rich element ( ARE ) binding proteins ( e.g. <unk> and TTP ) , which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs . The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins ( e.g. <unk> / <unk> and <unk> / <unk> in humans / yeast ) that are required for processing certain substrates . 
 In addition to single proteins , other protein complexes interact with the exosome . One of those is the cytoplasmic Ski complex , which includes an RNA helicase ( <unk> ) and is involved in mRNA degradation . In the nucleus , the processing of rRNA and snoRNA by the exosome is mediated by the <unk> complex , which contains both RNA helicase ( <unk> ) and polyadenylation ( <unk> ) activity . 
 = = Function = = 
 = = = <unk> function = = = 
 As stated above , the exosome complex contains many proteins with ribonuclease domains . The exact nature of these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost . The exosome is primarily a 3 ' -5 ' exoribonuclease , meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3 ' end . <unk> contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic ( the RNase PH @-@ like proteins ) or , in eukaryotes , hydrolytic ( the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins ) . The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates . The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates . 
 In archaea , the Rrp41 subunit of the complex is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease . Three copies of this protein are present in the ring and are responsible for the activity of the complex . In eukaryotes , none of the RNase PH subunits have retained this catalytic activity , meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein . Despite this loss of catalytic activity , the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans , suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function . In eukaryotes , the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes , which are responsible for the ribonuclease activity of the exosome in such organisms . 
 As stated above , the hydrolytic proteins Rrp6 and Rrp44 are associated with the exosome in yeast and in humans , besides Rrp6 , two different proteins , Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein . Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3 ' -5 ' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well , the existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex . 
 = = = Substrates = = = 
 The exosome is involved in the degradation and processing of a wide variety of RNA species . In the cytoplasm of cells , it is involved in the turn @-@ over of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules . The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors , through interactions with proteins from the nonsense mediated decay or non @-@ stop decay pathways . In alternative fashion , mRNAs are degraded as part of their normal turnover . Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU @-@ rich elements in the 3 ' untranslated region of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex . In the nucleus , the exosome is required for the correct processing of several small nuclear RNA molecules . Finally , the nucleolus is the compartment where the majority of the exosome complexes are found . There it plays a role in the processing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA ( the first identified function of the exosome ) and of several small nucleolar RNAs . 
 Although most cells have other enzymes that can degrade RNA , either from the 3 ' or from the 5 ' end of the RNA , the exosome complex is essential for cell survival . When the expression of exosome proteins is artificially reduced or stopped , for example by RNA interference , growth stops and the cells eventually die . Both the core proteins of the exosome complex , as well as the two main associated proteins , are essential proteins . Bacteria do not have an exosome complex ; however , similar functions are performed by a simpler complex that includes the protein PNPase , called the degradosome . 
 The exosome is a key complex in cellular RNA quality control . Unlike prokaryotes , eukaryotes possess highly active RNA surveillance systems that recognise unprocessed and mis @-@ processed RNA @-@ protein complexes ( such as ribosomes ) prior to their exit from the nucleus . It is presumed that this system prevents aberrant complexes from interfering with important cellular processes such as protein synthesis . 
 In addition to RNA processing , turnover and surveillance activities , the exosome is important for the degradation of so @-@ called cryptic unstable transcripts ( <unk> ) that are produced from thousands of loci within the yeast genome . The importance of these unstable RNAs and their degradation are still unclear , but similar RNA species have also been detected in human cells . 
 = = Disease = = 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The exosome complex is the target of autoantibodies in patients suffering from various autoimmune diseases . These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM / Scl overlap syndrome , an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either <unk> or dermatomyositis . <unk> can be detected in the serum of patients by a variety of assays . In the past , the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts , immunofluorescence on <unk> @-@ 2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts . In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti @-@ exosome positive sera , a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated . Already years before the exosome complex was identified , this pattern was termed the PM / Scl complex . <unk> using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells , which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis . More recently , recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays ( <unk> ) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ( <unk> ) for detecting these antibodies . 
 In these diseases , antibodies are mainly directed against two of the proteins of the complex , called PM / Scl @-@ 100 ( the RNase D like protein ) and PM / Scl @-@ 75 ( one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring ) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30 % of patients with the PM / Scl overlap syndrome . Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies , other exosome subunits and associated proteins ( like <unk> ) can be targeted in these patients . At the current time , the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide , derived from the PM / Scl @-@ 100 protein , as the antigen in an ELISA , instead of complete proteins . By this method , autoantibodies are found in up to 55 % of patients with the PM / Scl overlap syndrome , but they can also be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma , <unk> , or dermatomyositis alone . 
 As the <unk> are found mainly in patients that have characteristics of several different autoimmune diseases , the clinical symptoms of these patients can vary widely . The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical symptoms of the individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud 's phenomenon , arthritis , <unk> and scleroderma . Treatment of these patients is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease , often involving either immunosuppressive or <unk> drugs .

 The exosome has been shown to be inhibited by the <unk> fluorouracil , a drug used in the chemotherapy of cancer . It is one of the most successful drugs for treating solid tumors . In yeast cells treated with fluorouracil , defects were found in the processing of ribosomal RNA identical to those seen when the activity of the exosome was blocked by molecular biological strategies . Lack of correct ribosomal RNA processing is lethal to cells , explaining the <unk> effect of the drug .

 = Mendelevium = 
 Mendelevium is a synthetic element with chemical symbol Md ( formerly Mv ) and atomic number 101 . A metallic radioactive transuranic element in the actinide series , it is the first element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements . It is the antepenultimate actinide and the ninth transuranic element . It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles . A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known , the most stable being 258Md with a half @-@ life of 51 days ; nevertheless , the shorter @-@ lived 256Md ( half @-@ life 1 @.@ 27 hours ) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale . 
 Mendelevium was discovered by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles in 1955 , the same method still used to produce it today . It was named after Dmitri Mendeleev , father of the periodic table of the chemical elements . Using available microgram quantities of the isotope einsteinium @-@ 253 , over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced each hour . The chemistry of mendelevium is typical for the late actinides , with a preponderance of the + 3 oxidation state but also an accessible + 2 oxidation state . Owing to the small amounts of produced mendelevium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half @-@ lives , there are currently no uses for it outside of basic scientific research . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Mendelevium was the ninth transuranic element to be synthesized . It was first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso , Glenn T. Seaborg , Gregory R. Choppin , Bernard G. Harvey , and team leader Stanley G. Thompson in early 1955 at the University of California , Berkeley . The team produced 256Md ( half @-@ life of 87 minutes ) when they bombarded an 253Es target consisting of only a billion ( 109 ) einsteinium atoms with alpha particles ( helium nuclei ) in the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory 's 60 @-@ inch cyclotron , thus increasing the target 's atomic number by two . 256Md thus became the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time . In total , seventeen mendelevium atoms were produced . This discovery was part of a program , begun in 1952 , that irradiated plutonium with neutrons to transmute it into heavier actinides . This method was necessary as the previous method used to synthesize transuranic elements , neutron capture , could not work because of a lack of beta decaying isotopes of fermium that would produce isotopes of the next element , mendelevium , and also due to the very short half @-@ life to spontaneous fission of fermium @-@ 258 that thus constituted a hard limit to the success of the neutron capture process . 
 To predict if the production of mendelevium would be possible , the team made use of a rough calculation . The number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal to the product of the number of atoms of target material , the target 's cross section , the ion beam intensity , and the time of bombardment ; this last factor was related to the half @-@ life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half @-@ life . This gave one atom per experiment . Thus under optimum conditions , the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be expected . This calculation demonstrated that it was feasible to go ahead with the experiment . The target material , einsteinium @-@ 253 , could be produced readily from irradiating plutonium : one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms , and its three @-@ week half @-@ life meant that the element 101 experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target . However , it was necessary to upgrade the cyclotron to obtain the needed intensity of 1014 alpha particles per second ; Seaborg applied for the necessary funds . 
 While Seaborg applied for funding , Harvey worked on the einsteinium target , while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation . Choppin suggested using α @-@ <unk> acid to separate the mendelevium atoms from those of the lighter actinides . The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique , introduced by Albert Ghiorso . In this technique , the einsteinium was placed on the opposite side of the target from the beam , so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold . This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique , developed by Alfred Chetham @-@ Strode . This technique gave a very high yield , which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material . The recoil target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil . It was bombarded by 41 MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6 × 1013 particles per second over an area of 0 @.@ 05 cm2 . The target was cooled by water or liquid helium , and the foil could be replaced . 
 Initial experiments were carried out in September 1954 . No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms ; thus , Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by electron capture to fermium and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for spontaneous fission events . The repetition of the experiment happened in February 1955 . 
 On the day of discovery , 19 February , alpha irradiation of the einsteinium target occurred in three three @-@ hour sessions . The cyclotron was in the University of California campus , while the Radiation Laboratory was on the next hill . To deal with this situation , a complex procedure was used : Ghiorso took the catcher foils ( there were three targets and three foils ) from the cyclotron to Harvey , who would use aqua regia to dissolve it and pass it through an anion @-@ exchange resin column to separate out the transuranium elements from the gold and other products . The resultant drops entered a test tube , which Choppin and Ghiorso took in a car to get to the Radiation Laboratory as soon as possible . There Thompson and Choppin used a cation @-@ exchange resin column and the α @-@ <unk> acid . The solution drops were collected on platinum disks and dried under heat lamps . The three disks were expected to contain respectively the fermium , no new elements , and the mendelevium . Finally , they were placed in their own counters , which were connected to recorders such that spontaneous fission events would be recorded as huge deflections in a graph showing the number and time of the decays . There thus was no direct detection , but by observation of spontaneous fission events arising from its electron @-@ capture daughter 256Fm . The first one was identified with a " hooray " followed by a " double hooray " and a " triple hooray " . The fourth one eventually officially proved the chemical identification of the 101st element , mendelevium . In total , five decays were reported up till 4 a.m. Seaborg was notified and the team left to sleep . Additional analysis and further experimentation showed the produced mendelevium isotope to have mass 256 and to decay by electron capture to fermium @-@ 256 with a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 5 h . 
 We thought it fitting that there be an element named for the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev , who had developed the periodic table . In nearly all our experiments discovering transuranium elements , we 'd depended on his method of predicting chemical properties based on the element 's position in the table . But in the middle of the Cold War , naming an element for a Russian was a somewhat bold gesture that did not sit well with some American critics . 
 Being the first of the second hundred of the chemical elements , it was decided that the element would be named " mendelevium " after the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev , father of the periodic table . Due to the fact that this discovery came during the Cold War , Seaborg had to request permission of the government of the United States to propose that the element be named for a Russian , but it was granted . The name " mendelevium " was accepted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) in 1955 with symbol " Mv " , which was changed to " Md " in the next IUPAC General Assembly ( Paris , 1957 ) .

 In the periodic table , mendelevium is located to the right of the actinide fermium , to the left of the actinide nobelium , and below the lanthanide thulium . Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities , and bulk preparation is currently impossible . Nevertheless , a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties . 
 The lanthanides and actinides , in the metallic state , can exist as either divalent ( such as europium and ytterbium ) or trivalent ( most other lanthanides ) metals . The former have <unk> configurations , whereas the latter have fn + 1s2 configurations . In 1975 , Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted values for the cohesive energies ( enthalpies of crystallization ) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides , both as divalent and trivalent metals . The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the [ Rn ] <unk> configuration over the [ Rn ] <unk> configuration for mendelevium was not enough to compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d , as is true also for the very late actinides : thus einsteinium , fermium , mendelevium , and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals . The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons , which increases with increasing atomic number . <unk> studies with trace quantities of mendelevium by <unk> and <unk> from 1976 to 1982 confirmed this prediction . In 1990 , Haire and Gibson estimated mendelevium metal to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 134 and 142 kJ · mol − 1 . Divalent mendelevium metal should have a metallic radius of around ( 194 ± 10 ) pm . Like the other divalent late actinides ( except the once again trivalent lawrencium ) , metallic mendelevium should assume a face @-@ centered cubic crystal structure . Mendelevium 's melting point has been estimated at 827 ° C , the same value as that predicted for the neighboring element nobelium . Its density is predicted to be around 10 @.@ 3 ± 0 @.@ 7 g · cm − 3 . 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 The chemistry of mendelevium is mostly known only in solution , in which it can take on the + 3 or + 2 oxidation states . The + 1 state has also been reported , but has not yet been confirmed . 
 Before mendelevium 's discovery , Seaborg and Katz predicted that it should be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides . After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955 , these predictions were confirmed , first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation @-@ exchange column of resin , and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that <unk> with trivalent lanthanide salts . <unk> @-@ exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide , fermium . Mendelevium can form coordination complexes with 1 @,@ 2 @-@ <unk> acid ( DCTA ) . 
 In reducing conditions , mendelevium ( III ) can be easily reduced to mendelevium ( II ) , which is stable in aqueous solution . The standard reduction potential of the E ° ( Md3 + → Md2 + ) couple has been variously estimated as − 0 @.@ 10 V or − 0 @.@ 20 V. In comparison , E ° ( Md3 + → <unk> ) should be around − 1 @.@ 74 V , and E ° ( Md2 + → <unk> ) should be around − 2 @.@ 5 V. Mendelevium ( II ) ' s elution behavior has been compared with that of strontium ( II ) and europium ( II ) . 
 In 1973 , mendelevium ( I ) was reported to have been produced by Russian scientists , who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with samarium ( II ) . It was found to be stable in neutral water – ethanol solution and be homologous to caesium ( I ) . However , later experiments found no evidence for mendelevium ( I ) and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced , not like the monovalent alkali metals . Nevertheless , the Russian team conducted further studies on the thermodynamics of <unk> mendelevium with alkali metal chlorides , and concluded that mendelevium ( I ) had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements , thus <unk> with them . The status of the + 1 oxidation state is still tentative . 
 Although E ° ( <unk> + → Md3 + ) was predicted in 1975 to be + 5 @.@ 4 V , suggesting that mendelevium ( III ) could be easily oxidized to mendelevium ( IV ) , 1967 experiments with the strong oxidizing agent sodium <unk> were unable to oxidize mendelevium ( III ) to mendelevium ( IV ) . 
 = = = Atomic = = = 
 A mendelevium atom has 101 electrons , of which at least three ( and perhaps four ) can act as valence electrons . They are expected to be arranged in the configuration [ Rn ] <unk> ( ground state term symbol <unk> / 2 ) , although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006 . In forming compounds , three valence electrons may be lost , leaving behind a [ Rn ] <unk> core : this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their [ Rn ] 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state . The first ionization potential of mendelevium was measured to be at most ( 6 @.@ 58 ± 0 @.@ 07 ) eV in 1974 , based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones ; this value has since not yet been refined further due to mendelevium 's scarcity and high radioactivity . The ionic radius of <unk> Md3 + had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 91 @.@ 2 pm ; 1988 calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and ionic radius produced a value of 89 @.@ 6 pm , as well as an enthalpy of hydration of − ( <unk> ± 12 ) kJ · mol − 1 . Md2 + should have an ionic radius of 115 pm and hydration enthalpy − 1413 kJ · mol − 1 ; Md + should have ionic radius 117 pm . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Sixteen isotopes of mendelevium are known , with mass numbers from 245 to 260 ; all are radioactive . Additionally , five nuclear isomers are known : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Of these , the longest @-@ lived isotope is 258Md with a half @-@ life of 51 @.@ 5 days , and the longest @-@ lived isomer is <unk> with a half @-@ life of 58 @.@ 0 minutes . Nevertheless , the slightly shorter @-@ lived 256Md ( half @-@ life 1 @.@ 27 hours ) is more often used in chemical experimentation because it can be produced in larger quantities from alpha particle irradiation of einsteinium . After 258Md , the next most stable mendelevium isotopes are 260Md with a half @-@ life of 31 @.@ 8 days , <unk> with a half @-@ life of 5 @.@ 52 hours , <unk> with a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 60 hours , and 256Md with a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 27 hours . All of the remaining mendelevium isotopes have half @-@ lives that are less than an hour , and the majority of these have half @-@ lives that are less than 5 minutes . 
 The half @-@ lives of mendelevium isotopes mostly increase smoothly from <unk> onwards , reaching a maximum at 258Md . Experiments and predictions suggest that the half @-@ lives will then decrease , apart from 260Md with a half @-@ life of 31 @.@ 8 days , as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode due to the mutual repulsion of the protons posing a limit to the island of relative stability of long @-@ lived nuclei in the actinide series . 
 Mendelevium @-@ 256 , the chemically most important isotope of mendelevium , decays through electron capture 90 @.@ 7 % of the time and alpha decay 9 @.@ 9 % of the time . It is most easily detected through the spontaneous fission of its electron @-@ capture daughter fermium @-@ 256 , but in the presence of other nuclides that undergo spontaneous fission , alpha decays at the characteristic energies for mendelevium @-@ 256 ( 7 @.@ 205 and 7 @.@ 139 MeV ) can provide more useful identification .

 The lightest mendelevium isotopes ( <unk> to <unk> ) are mostly produced through bombardment of bismuth targets with heavy argon ions , while slightly heavier ones ( <unk> to <unk> ) are produced by bombarding plutonium and americium targets with lighter ions of carbon and nitrogen . The most important and most stable isotopes are in the range from <unk> to 258Md and are produced through bombardment of einsteinium isotopes with alpha particles : einsteinium @-@ 253 , -254 , and <unk> can all be used . <unk> is produced as a daughter of 259No , and 260Md can be produced in a transfer reaction between einsteinium @-@ 254 and oxygen @-@ 18 . Typically , the most commonly used isotope 256Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium @-@ 253 or -254 with alpha particles : einsteinium @-@ 254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half @-@ life and therefore can be used as a target for longer . Using available microgram quantities of einsteinium , <unk> quantities of mendelevium @-@ 256 may be produced . 
 The recoil momentum of the produced mendelevium @-@ 256 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the einsteinium target from which they are produced , bringing them onto a thin foil of metal ( usually beryllium , aluminium , platinum , or gold ) just behind the target in a vacuum . This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation , which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target . The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere ( frequently helium ) , and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along . Using a long capillary tube , and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas , the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined . The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride , then using a cation @-@ exchange resin column with a 10 % ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid , acting as an eluant . However , if the foil is made of gold and thin enough , it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion @-@ exchange chromatography , the eluant being 6 M hydrochloric acid . 
 Mendelevium can finally be separated from the other trivalent actinides using selective elution from a cation @-@ exchange resin column , the eluant being ammonia α @-@ HIB . Using the gas @-@ jet method often renders the first two steps unnecessary . The above procedure is the most commonly used one for the separation of <unk> elements . 
 Another possible way to separate the trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis- ( 2 @-@ ethylhexyl ) phosphoric acid ( abbreviated as HDEHP ) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase . The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation @-@ exchange resin column , so that the heavier actinides elute later . The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column ; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then <unk> very late in the elution sequence , after fermium . 
 Another method to isolate mendelevium exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2 + from those of Es3 + and Fm3 + . The initial steps are the same as above , and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography , but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride . Then , 50 mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the + 2 state in 0 @.@ 1 M hydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury . The solvent extraction then proceeds , and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column , mendelevium ( II ) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid . It is then <unk> to the + 3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2 M hydrochloric acid ( to remove impurities , including chromium ) and finally 6 M hydrochloric acid ( to remove the mendelevium ) . It is also possible to use a column of <unk> and zinc amalgam , using 1 M hydrochloric acid as an eluant , reducing Md ( III ) to Md ( II ) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals . <unk> chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium <unk> : the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile . 
 = National Diet = 
 The National Diet ( <unk> , <unk> ) is Japan 's bicameral legislature . It is composed of a lower house called the House of Representatives , and an upper house , called the House of Councillors . Both houses of the Diet are directly elected under parallel voting systems . In addition to passing laws , the Diet is formally responsible for selecting the Prime Minister . The Diet was first convened as the Imperial Diet in 1889 as a result of adopting the Meiji Constitution . The Diet took its current form in 1947 upon the adoption of the post @-@ war constitution and is considered by the Constitution to be the highest organ of state power . The National Diet Building is located in <unk> , Chiyoda , Tokyo . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The houses of the Diet are both elected under parallel voting systems . This means that the seats to be filled in any given election are divided into two groups , each elected by a different method ; the main difference between the houses is in the sizes of the two groups and how they are elected . Voters are also asked to cast two votes : one for an individual candidate in a constituency , and one for a party list . Any national of Japan at least 20 years of age may vote in these elections , which will be changed to 18 in 2016 . Japan 's parallel voting system is not to be confused with the Additional Member System used in many other nations . 
 House of Representatives : Of 475 members , 295 are elected from single seat constituencies under the Single Member Plurality ( " First @-@ past @-@ the @-@ post " ) system , and 180 are elected from eleven separate electoral blocs under the party list system of proportional representation ( PR ) . 
 House of Councillors : Of 242 members , 146 are elected from 47 prefectural constituencies by means of the Single Non @-@ <unk> Vote . The remaining 96 are elected by open list PR from a single national list . 
 The Constitution of Japan does not specify the number of members of each house of the Diet , the voting system , or the necessary qualifications of those who may vote or be returned in parliamentary elections , thus allowing all of these things to be determined by law . However it does guarantee universal adult suffrage and a secret ballot . It also insists that the electoral law must not discriminate in terms of " race , creed , sex , social status , family origin , education , property or income " . 
 Generally , the election of Diet members is controlled by statutes passed by the Diet . This is a source of contention concerning re @-@ apportionment of prefectures ' seats in response to changes of population distribution . For example , the Liberal Democratic Party had controlled Japan for most of its post @-@ war history , and it gained much of its support from rural areas . During the post @-@ war era , large numbers of people were relocating to the urban centers in the seeking of wealth ; though some re @-@ <unk> have been made to the number of each prefecture 's assigned seats in the Diet , rural areas generally have more representation than do urban areas . The Supreme Court of Japan began exercising judicial review of apportionment laws following the Kurokawa decision of 1976 , invalidating an election in which one district in Hyōgo Prefecture received five times the representation of another district in Osaka Prefecture . The Supreme Court has since indicated that the highest electoral imbalance permissible under Japanese law is 3 : 1 , and that any greater imbalance between any two districts is a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution . In recent elections the malapportionment ratio amounted to 4 @.@ 8 in the House of Councillors ( census 2005 : <unk> / Tottori ; election 2007 : Kanagawa / Tottori ) and 2 @.@ 3 in the House of Representatives ( election 2009 : Chiba 4 / Kōchi 3 ) . 
 Candidates for the lower house must be 25 years old or older and 30 years or older for the upper house . All candidates must be Japanese nationals . Under Article 49 of Japan 's Constitution , Diet members are paid about ¥ 1 @.@ 3 million a month in salary . Each lawmaker is entitled to employ three secretaries with taxpayer funds , free train tickets , and four round @-@ trip airplane tickets a month to enable them to travel back and forth to their home districts . 
 = = Powers = = 
 Article 41 of the Constitution describes the National Diet as " the highest organ of State power " and " the sole law @-@ making organ of the State " . This statement is in forceful contrast to the Meiji Constitution , which described the Emperor as the one who exercised legislative power with the consent of the Diet . The Diet 's responsibilities include not only the making of laws but also the approval of the annual national budget that the government submits and the ratification of treaties . It can also initiate draft constitutional amendments , which , if approved , must be presented to the people in a referendum . The Diet may conduct " investigations in relation to government " ( Article 62 ) . The Prime Minister must be designated by Diet resolution , establishing the principle of legislative supremacy over executive government agencies ( Article 67 ) . The government can also be dissolved by the Diet if it passes a motion of no confidence introduced by fifty members of the House of Representatives . Government officials , including the Prime Minister and Cabinet members , are required to appear before Diet investigative committees and answer inquiries . The Diet also has the power to impeach judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct . 
 In most circumstances , in order to become law a bill must be first passed by both houses of the Diet and then promulgated by the Emperor . This role of the Emperor is similar to the Royal Assent in some other nations ; however , the Emperor cannot refuse to promulgate a law and therefore his legislative role is merely a formality . 
 The House of Representatives is the more powerful chamber of the Diet . While the House of Representatives cannot usually overrule the House of Councillors on a bill , the House of Councillors can only delay the adoption of a budget or a treaty that has been approved by the House of Representatives , and the House of Councillors has almost no power at all to prevent the lower house from selecting any Prime Minister it wishes . Furthermore , once appointed it is the confidence of the House of Representatives alone that the Prime Minister must enjoy in order to continue in office . The House of Representatives can overrule the upper house in the following circumstances : 
 If a bill is adopted by the House of Representatives and then either rejected , amended or not approved within 60 days by the House of Councillors , then the bill will become law if again adopted by the House of Representatives by a majority of at least two @-@ thirds of members present . 
 If both houses cannot agree on a budget or a treaty , even through the appointment of a joint committee of the Diet , or if the House of Councillors fails to take final action on a proposed budget or treaty within 30 days of its approval by the House of Representatives , then the decision of the lower house is deemed to be that of the Diet . 
 If both houses cannot agree on a candidate for Prime Minister , even through a joint committee , or if the House of Councillors fails to designate a candidate within 10 days of House of Representatives ' decision , then the nominee of the lower house is deemed to be that of the Diet . 
 = = Activities = = 
 Under the Constitution , at least one session of the Diet must be convened each year . Technically , only the House of Representatives is dissolved before an election but while the lower house is in dissolution the House of Councillors is usually " closed " . The Emperor both <unk> the Diet and dissolves the House of Representatives but in doing must act on the advice of the Cabinet . In an emergency the Cabinet can convoke the Diet for an extraordinary session , and an extraordinary session may be requested by one @-@ quarter of the members of either house . At the beginning of each parliamentary session the Emperor reads a special speech from his throne in the chamber of the House of Councillors . 
 The presence of one @-@ third of the membership of either house constitutes a quorum and deliberations are in public unless at least two @-@ thirds of those present agree otherwise . Each house elects its own presiding officer who exercises the casting vote in the event of a tie . Members of each house have certain protections against arrest while the Diet is in session and words spoken and votes cast in the Diet enjoy parliamentary privilege . Each house of the Diet determines its own standing orders and has responsibility for disciplining its own members . A member may be expelled , but only by a two @-@ thirds majority vote . Every member of the Cabinet has the right to appear in either house of the Diet for the purpose of speaking on bills , and each house has the right to compel the appearance of Cabinet members . 
 = = History = = 
 Japan 's first modern legislature was the Imperial Diet ( <unk> , Teikoku @-@ <unk> ) established by the Meiji Constitution in force from 1889 to 1947 . The Meiji Constitution was adopted on February 11 , 1889 and the Imperial Diet first met on November 29 , 1890 when the document entered into operation . The Diet consisted of a House of Representatives and a House of Peers ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ in ) . The House of Representatives was directly elected , if on a limited franchise ; universal adult male suffrage was introduced in 1925 . The House of Peers , much like the British House of Lords , consisted of high @-@ ranking nobles . 
 The word diet derives from Latin and was a common name for an assembly in medieval Germany . The Meiji constitution was largely based on the form of constitutional monarchy found in nineteenth century Prussia and the new Diet was modeled partly on the German Reichstag and partly on the British Westminster system . Unlike the post @-@ war constitution , the Meiji constitution granted a real political role to the Emperor , although in practice the Emperor 's powers were largely directed by a group of oligarchs called the genrō or elder statesmen . 
 To become law or bill , a constitutional amendment had to have the assent of both the Diet and the Emperor . This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had a veto over the Diet . The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet , and so , under the Meiji constitution , Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet . The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget . While the Diet could veto the annual budget , if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force . This all changed with the new constitution after World War II . 
 The proportional representation system for the House of Councillors , introduced in 1982 , was the first major electoral reform under the post @-@ war constitution . Instead of choosing national constituency candidates as individuals , as had previously been the case , voters cast ballots for parties . Individual councillors , listed officially by the parties before the election , are selected on the basis of the parties ' proportions of the total national constituency vote . The system was introduced to reduce the excessive money spent by candidates for the national constituencies . Critics charged , however , that this new system benefited the two largest parties , the LDP and the Japan Socialist Party ( now Social Democratic Party ) , which in fact had sponsored the reform . 
 = Chinga ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Chinga " is the tenth episode of the fifth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It was written by noted author Stephen King and series creator Chris Carter , and directed by Kim Manners . The episode aired in the United States on February 8 , 1998 on the Fox network . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Chinga " earned a Nielsen rating of 12 @.@ 8 and was viewed by 21 @.@ 33 million viewers . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Scully takes a vacation to Maine , where she encounters a bizarre case where the victims appear to have inflicted wounds upon themselves — apparently at the behest of a strange young girl . 
 " Chinga " was co @-@ written by noted horror author Stephen King after he requested to pen an episode of The X @-@ Files . Carter rewrote portions of King 's final draft , resulting in a shared writing credit for the entry . During filming , Gillian Anderson performed her lines in a tongue in cheek manner , which resulted in Carter informing her that her lines were not meant to be humorous and that the production staff was having to edit out various shots . The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket , a first for the series , according to art director Greg Loewen . Chinga , the titular evil doll , was created by sewing together various doll parts , including an oversized head and a wig created from multiple <unk> . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the coastal town of Amma Beach , Maine , five @-@ year @-@ old Polly Turner and her antique doll , Chinga , accompany her mother , Melissa , as she goes to a local grocery store . Melissa attracts the attention of the store 's butcher , Dave . Moments later , Melissa sees a ghostly image of Dave with a knife protruding from one eye . Horrified , Melissa tries to leave the store with Polly . However , as they make their way towards the store 's exit , customers begin clawing at their eyes . Meanwhile , Dave , after seeing a monstrous reflection of Chinga , is compelled by an outside force to turn his knife on himself . 
 Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) is coincidentally in the area , taking a vacation in Maine . After stumbling upon the carnage in the grocery store , Scully telephones Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and describes the bizarre situation . Mulder tells Scully that the incident might be the result of witchcraft or sorcery . Scully , however , can find no physical evidence that might support his theory . Assisted by the local police , Scully reviews the store 's surveillance footage and notices Melissa Turner leaving the scene , the only customer unaffected . Jack Bonsaint , the police chief , tells Scully that some townspeople believe Melissa to be a witch . Deputy Buddy Riggs informs Melissa that Bonsaint will be questioning her . Riggs promises to help Melissa , but she warns him to stay away . 
 Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa 's home , but find it unoccupied . Bonsaint tells Scully that Melissa was once married to a local fisherman , but was widowed when he was inexplicably found dead aboard his fishing boat , the hook on his winch driven through his skull . Later , it is revealed that he found Chinga in a lobster trap and gave it to Polly as a present shortly before he died . Bonsaint also explains that there had been an incident between Polly and Jane Froelich , the proprietor of a local daycare center , when Jane slapped Polly over her behavior . Meanwhile , Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop . Melissa describes how she has seen images of violent deaths , such as Dave 's , before they occur . Riggs gives Melissa the key to a remote cabin and suggests that she leave town . When Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries , the worker insists that she needs to pay for them . Just then , the worker is nearly killed when her hair gets caught in the mixer until Riggs saves her . 
 Scully and Bonsaint visit Froelich , who claims Melissa is the descendant of witches and that she is passing her cursed lineage to Polly . Later , while speaking with a park ranger , Melissa sees a bloody image of Froelich and she quickly turns around to head home . Meanwhile , Froelich is confronted by the enlarged Chinga and is forced to slit her own throat with the shard of a phonograph record . At the scene , Scully receives a phone call from Mulder who ( in a twist of character ) believes that there might be a scientific explanation to the people at the grocery store - chorea , otherwise known as " dancing sickness " ; Scully , however , remains doubtful . After Melissa sees a vision of Riggs , the deputy is forced to bludgeon himself to death with his own night stick . Finally , Melissa sees a bloodied reflection of herself in a window , a hammer buried in her skull . She proceeds to burn the house down in an attempt to destroy the doll . Polly arrives in the kitchen with Chinga , who somehow manages to extinguish the lit matches that Melissa strikes . 
 Scully and Bonsaint drive to the Turner home . Scully , peering through the windows , discovers Melissa attempting to set fire to the house , with her , her daughter and Chinga all trapped inside . Bonsaint breaks down the nailed door as Melissa runs to a closet and grabs hold of a hammer which she , against her will , turns upon herself . Thinking quickly , Scully grabs the Chinga doll and throws it inside a microwave oven in the kitchen . As the doll melts , Melissa drops the hammer and regains her senses . In the final scene , a fisherman is seen pulling up a lobster trap , and in it is the burned doll , which comes back to life .

 The episode was co @-@ written by noted horror author Stephen King . King initially approached series co @-@ star David Duchovny and informed him that he loved the show and desired to write an episode . Eventually , he called series creator Chris Carter and expressed his desire to write an episode of Millennium instead . Carter agreed , but once more , King changed his mind and it was decided that he would write an episode of The X @-@ Files . King sent various drafts to Carter from his home in Maine ; the two individuals never actually met one another . King 's original story had some issues that Carter rewrote . Carter explained , " Stephen wasn 't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [ ... ] the Mulder @-@ and @-@ Scully story in his original draft didn 't quite work " . Carter separated Mulder and Scully in the finalized draft and helped to finalize the script , hence their dual writing credit on the episode . Kim Manners , the director for the episode , later said , " I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece , and when it was all said and done , there was very little Stephen King left in it . The nuts and bolts were his , but that was really one of Chris ' scripts . " Unbeknownst to either Carter or King , the word " Chinga " can be considered a vulgar Spanish colloquialism . 
 During filming , Gillian Anderson was unsure how exactly to perform her lines . She noted , " the way the script was originally read to me , initially seemed to me as if Scully kind of stepped up to the plate and played along with the sheriff 's humor " . She reportedly performed her lines in a " tongue in cheek " -esque way before receiving a call from Carter . He informed her that her lines were not meant to be humorous and that the production staff was having to " edit out a lot of stuff " in order to make up for this . Several of the scenes in the episode were shot at the places they stood in for . The gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series ' production headquarters . The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket , Shop Easy in Port Coquitlam , a first for the series , according to art director Greg Loewen . The scenes required the store to be closed before Christmas and be installed with up @-@ right freezers . 
 Chinga , the titular evil doll , was created by sewing together various doll parts . An oversized doll 's head was placed on the finished body and " the world 's largest wig " adorned its head . Props master Ken Hawryliw later reported that the hairpiece was actually the result of several wigs being sewn together . Most of the makeup effects were created by artist Toby Lindala , who " appreciate the chance to create these classics for a Stephen King project " . The " Death Under Glass " scene featuring Dave the Butcher with a knife in his eyes was created in post @-@ production via a computer . Special effects supervisor Laurie <unk> @-@ George tested the scene on her nine- and eleven @-@ year @-@ old sons , explaining that " I gauge a lot of the show by whether my kids can stand them or not . If they can 't , I figure I succeeded [ ... ] ' Chinga ' bothered them a lot .

However , because the title " Chinga " is a Mexican Spanish swear word " equivalent to ' fuck ' and in very common usage " , the episode was retitled " <unk> " when it aired in the UK . 
 " Chinga " received mixed reviews from critics . Anna Redman of HELLO ! Canada was positive toward the episode , and referred to it as " one of the series ' best episodes " . Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave a mixed review , awarded it a C – , and called it an episode that " seems like one of those ideas that sounds really , really great until someone thinks about for more than a minute . " Handlen argued that King was a wrong fit for The X @-@ Files and that the resultant script was King " being asked to marry his voice to Carter 's " . He derided the plot and wrote that it was written " like someone ( Darin Morgan , only not funny at all ) doing a parody for the most familiar King tropes . " Handlen , however , did praise the violence in the episode , noting that he is " a sucker for gore " , but ultimately called the episode " lousy " . John Keegan from Critical Myth heavily criticized the episode 's writing and gave it a 4 out of 10 @.@ he wrote , " Overall , this episode is quite a disappointment , considering that Stephen King would appear to be an obvious match for a series like this . Unfortunately , the final script doesn ’ t seem to be a true horror story or the whimsical character study that it clearly wants to be , and so it fails to satisfy on either account . There are some great character moments , but it ’ s not enough to save the episode . " 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five and called it " clumsy " . The two argued that the premise of " Chinga " would have been better suited to a book or short story , as is King 's forte . However , its translation to television resulted in an episode " so on the nose , it makes you wince . " Despite this , Shearman and Pearson complimented Carter 's rewrites as well as the various jokes thrown throughout the episode . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four . She called the entry " a major disappointment " and wrote that it " isn 't scary in the least " . Vitaris even argued that " it 's unintentionally funny " and that the scenes with Mulder that are supposed to play as humor do not . Vitaris wrote that the episode was like the third season entry " Pusher " , except with less focus ; ultimately , the episode degenerates into " watching people get killed in various gruesome ways while Scully and <unk> finally collect enough information [ … ] in the nick of time . " 
 Erin McCann of The Guardian listed " Chinga " as one of the " 13 best X @-@ Files episodes ever " . 
 Despite the lackluster reception the episode garnered , several critics considered the entry scary . Katie Anderson from Cinefantastique named the scene wherein Dave the Butcher kills himself as the eighth " Scariest Moment " in The X @-@ Files .

 = HMS Mars ( 1896 ) = 
 HMS Mars was a Royal Navy pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Majestic class , the seventh member of a class of nine ships . The ship was laid down in the Laird Brothers shipyard in June 1894 , she was launched in March 1896 , and she was commissioned into the fleet in June 1897 . She was armed with a main battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns and a secondary battery of twelve 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) guns . The ship had a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 Mars served in the Channel Fleet after her commissioning , and in 1902 an accident with her forward main battery killed eleven men and badly damaged the turret . She was present at the Coronation Fleet Review for Edward VII later that year . She was reduced temporarily to the Reserve in March 1906 before returning to service with the Channel Fleet in October . The following March she was reassigned to the Home Fleet . As tensions in Europe rose dramatically in late July 1914 , Mars was mobilized with her sister ships into the 9th Battle Squadron , based as a guard ship in the Humber . In December , she was transferred to the Dover Patrol , though in February 1915 , she was decommissioned in Belfast and disarmed . Mars served as a troop ship during the Dardanelles Campaign before being converted into a depot ship . She remained in service until July 1920 ; the old ship was sold for scrap in May 1921 and broken up in November . 
 = = Design = = 
 Mars was 421 feet ( 128 m ) long overall and had a beam of 75 ft ( 23 m ) and a draft of 27 ft ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She displaced up to 16 @,@ 060 t ( 15 @,@ 810 long tons ; 17 @,@ 700 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines powered by eight coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . By 1907 – 1908 , she was re @-@ boilered with oil @-@ fired models . Her engines provided a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) at 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) . The Majestics were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers , although they suffered from high fuel consumption . She had a crew of 672 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with four BL 12 @-@ inch Mk VIII guns in twin turrets , one forward and one aft . The turrets were placed on pear @-@ shaped barbettes ; six of her sisters had the same arrangement , but her sisters Caesar and Illustrious and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes . Mars also carried twelve QF 6 @-@ inch / 40 guns . They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships . She also carried sixteen QF 12 @-@ pounder guns and twelve QF 2 @-@ pounder guns . She was also equipped with five 18 @-@ inch ( 450 @-@ mm ) torpedo tubes , four of which were submerged in the ship 's hull , with the last in a deck @-@ mounted launcher . Mars and the other ships of her class had 9 inches ( 229 mm ) of Harvey armour , which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour . This allowed Mars and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection . The barbettes for the main battery were protected with 14 in ( 360 mm ) of armour , and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides . The ship 's armoured deck was 2 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 5 in ( 64 to 114 mm ) thick .

 HMS Mars was laid down at the Laird Brothers shipyard in Birkenhead on 2 June 1894 . She was launched on 30 March 1896 . She commissioned on 8 June 1897 for service with the Channel Fleet , where she served in the Portsmouth division . She was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria on 26 June 1897 . Captain Henry John May was appointed in command on 5 January 1899 , and succeeded by Captain Henry Deacon Barry who was appointed in command in September 1900 . She suffered a serious accident in April 1902 when one of her forward 12 @-@ inch ( 305 @-@ mm ) guns was fired before the breech was closed , killing two officers and nine enlisted men , injuring seven , and wrecking the forward main battery turret . She was at the Coronation Fleet Review for King Edward VII on 16 August 1902 . On 16 August 1904 , Mars began a refit at Portsmouth . During her refit , the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet in a reorganization on 1 January 1905 , and she remained in the renamed unit . Her refit was completed in March 1905 . Her Atlantic Fleet service ended on 31 March 1906 , when she commissioned into the Reserve at Portsmouth . 
 Mars recommissioned at Portsmouth for service in the new Channel Fleet on 31 October 1906 . This service ended when she paid off at Portsmouth on 4 March 1907 . Mars recommissioned on 5 March 1907 for service in the Devonport Division of the new Home Fleet which had been organized in January 1907 , and was based at Devonport . During this service , she underwent refits in 1908 – 1909 and 1911 – 1912 . By July 1914 , she was in the 4th Division , Home Fleet . With war appearing to be imminent , the Royal Navy undertook a precautionary mobilization on 27 July 1914 . As part of this , Mars and her sister ships Hannibal , Magnificent , and Victorious formed the 9th Battle Squadron , which was based in the Humber under the Admiral of Patrols . Mars was serving as a guard ship at the Humber when World War I began in August 1914 , and continued in that duty after the 9th Battle Squadron was dissolved on 7 August 1914 . 
 Mars was transferred to the Dover Patrol on 9 December 1914 , and was based at Dover briefly before moving to Portland on 11 December 1914 . She was based at Portland until February 1915 . The Majestic @-@ class ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy . In February 1915 , Mars transferred to Belfast , where she paid off on 15 February 1915 . In March and April 1915 she was disarmed there by Harland and Wolff , retaining only four of her 6 @-@ inch ( 152 @-@ mm ) guns and some lighter guns ; her 12 @-@ inch ( 305 @-@ mm ) guns were taken to arm the new Lord Clive @-@ class monitors Earl of Peterborough and Sir Thomas Picton . After that , she was laid up in Loch Goil in April 1915 . 
 In September 1915 , Mars recommissioned to serve as a troopship in the Dardanelles campaign . Mars and her similarly disarmed sister ships Hannibal and Magnificent , also acting as troopships , arrived at Mudros on 5 October 1915 . At the Dardanelles , Mars took part in the evacuation of Allied troops from Anzac Cove on 8 and 9 December 1915 and from West Beach at Cape Helles on 8 and 9 January 1916 . During the West Beach evacuation , Mars was covered by what had once been her 12 @-@ inch ( 305 @-@ mm ) guns , now mounted on Sir Thomas Picton . Mars returned to Devonport in February 1916 , then paid off at Chatham , where she underwent a refit for conversion to a harbor depot ship . She recommissioned as a harbor depot ship on 1 September 1916 , and served in this capacity at Invergordon until July 1920 . Mars was placed on the sale list at Invergordon on 7 July 1920 . She was sold for scrapping on 9 May 1921 and left Invergordon for scrapping at Briton Ferry in November 1921 .

 " I Love You ( Miss Robot ) " is a song written , performed and produced by the Buggles , a duo of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes , for their 1980 debut studio album The Age of Plastic . It was not released as a single . The song is , according to Downes , about " being on the road and making love to someone you don 't really like " , although music critics consider the song 's subject having to do with a robot . The song was performed live in 2010 , as part of the first performance of all the tracks from The Age of Plastic .

 " I Love You " is the fourth track of The Buggles ' debut studio album The Age of Plastic , although it was not released as a single . Plastic was recorded in 1979 , and was made on a budget of £ 60 @,@ 000 . The backing track of " I Love You " was recorded at Virgin 's Town House in West London , with mixing and recording of vocals held at Sarm East Studios . Gary Langan mixed the song on a Sunday in 1979 , between 11 : 00 pm / 12 : 00 am and 3 : 00 / 4 : 00 am . Langan has said that the song was " one of the best mixes I 've ever done " , and considered the song to be a " <unk> mix " . 
 = = Composition and critical response = = 
 When performing " I Love You " at the Ladbroke Grove 's Supperclub , a live performance known as " The Lost Gig " , Horn said that he conceived the idea of the song after playing Moon River on a bass guitar every Tuesday night . 
 " I Love You " is an electropop new wave song . Downes is also a vocalist on the track , which he sings through a vocoder . He said that " I Love You " was really about " being on the road and making love to someone you don 't really like , while all the time you 're wanting to phone someone who 's a long way off . " 
 Despite this , AllMusic , in their review of The Age of Plastic , considered the song to be about " a metaphorical love affair with a robot " that " explores modern man 's relationship to , and dependence on , technology " , and Craven Lovelace of the Grand Junction Free Press noted the song as an example of the increased popularity of robots as a musical subject in the early 1980s . Theo <unk> wrote in his book , Are We Not New Wave ? : Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s , that the title of The Age of Plastic and the songs " I Love You " and " Astroboy " " picture the arrival of the 1980s as a novelty era of playful futurism " . Chuck Eddy from Spin viewed the song title as a proof The Age of Plastic was " firmly in Kraftwerk 's future @-@ tech tradition " .

 = Tropical Storm Gilda ( 1973 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Gilda in 1973 was the first documented tropical cyclone on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone . It formed on October 16 in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave , and strengthened to reach peak winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) before striking Cuba . It later moved slowly through the Bahamas before weakening to tropical depression status . On October 24 , with the assistance of a cold front off the coast of the eastern United States , Gilda transformed into a subtropical storm , becoming very large and strong . The storm later accelerated northeastward and became extratropical , ultimately dissipating near Greenland . 
 The storm first brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica , causing six deaths and some damage from mudslides . While crossing Cuba and later the Bahamas , the storm caused little impact , limited to some crop damage . As a subtropical storm , Gilda brought gusty winds and high waves to much of the east coast of the United States , causing minor beach erosion and coastal property damage . 
 = = Storm history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on October 3 . It tracked westward , reaching the Caribbean Sea on October 10 . By October 13 , a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama , and over the next few days the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea . An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October 15 , which created a favorable upper @-@ level environment for the system by reducing wind shear . Around the same time , a low @-@ level trough emerged from the Intertropical Convergence Zone , heading north off the coast of Nicaragua . Early on October 16 , the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica . 
 The initial motion of the depression was uncertain , as steering currents could have resulted in a motion either to the west or to the north @-@ northeast . With the possibility of the western track , the storm was remarked as being the first serious hurricane threat for southern Florida since Hurricane Gladys in 1968 . However , after formation the depression moved slowly north @-@ northeastward . The thunderstorm activity gradually became better organized while rainbands increased around the circulation . By 0000 UTC on October 18 , the depression attained tropical storm status about 100 mi ( 160 km ) northwest of the Cayman Islands , after which it was named Gilda by the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) . The storm quickly strengthened as it moved toward southern Cuba , reaching peak winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) about 18 hours after reaching tropical storm status . Shortly thereafter , Gilda made landfall near the border of the present day Cuban provinces of Sancti Spíritus and Ciego de Ávila . 
 Tropical Storm Gilda weakened slightly over Cuba , crossing the island in less than twelve hours before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean early on October 19 . At the time , the anticyclone over Jamaica which previously assisted the cyclone instead remained over the Caribbean , which increased shear over the storm . This caused the convection to gradually separate from the low @-@ level circulation . Early on October 20 , Gilda passed just southeast of Andros Island in the Bahamas , around the same time that the Hurricane Hunters recorded an atmospheric pressure of 994 mbar ; this was the lowest recorded pressure in association with Gilda while it was a tropical cyclone . It gradually weakened due to the wind shear , resulting in the low @-@ level steering currents becoming dominant . After moving through the Exuma island chain , the storm passed near or over Eleuthera , and late on October 21 Gilda became nearly stationary about 60 mi ( 95 km / h ) east of Harbour Island . Late on October 22 , after moving only about 6 mi ( 10 km ) in a 24 ‑ hour period , Gilda weakened to a tropical depression . 
 Now a tropical depression , Gilda remained nearly stationary for another 24 hours before accelerating northeastward , under the influence of an upper @-@ level trough exiting the east coast of the United States . Cold air from the trough interacted with Gilda , providing a baroclinic environment for intensifying , and on October 24 the storm transitioned into a subtropical storm about halfway between Hispaniola and North Carolina . This made Gilda the first tropical storm on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone . Operationally , tropical storm advisories were still issued on Gilda while it was subtropical , due to the need to maintain consistency and the possibility it could again become tropical . The circulation of the storm became very large , at one point stretching from New England to the Bahamas , and eastward beyond Bermuda , or a diameter of more than 1300 mi ( 2100 km ) . On October 25 , Gilda passed about halfway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras , when it reached peak winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . Subsequently it turned northeastward , and on October 27 attained a minimum pressure of 984 mbar , the lowest of its duration while tropical or subtropical . Later that day , Gilda became an extratropical cyclone southeast of the Canadian Maritimes as it moved over colder waters . After passing just southeast of Newfoundland , the storm continued northeastward , becoming nearly stationary off the coast of Greenland before dissipating on October 30 . 
 = = Preparations , impact , and records = = 
 Tropical Storm Gilda first affected Jamaica , bringing heavy rainfall in a three @-@ day period . The highest amount measured in a 24 ‑ hour period within Jamaica was 411 millimetres ( 16 @.@ 2 in ) , which triggered many landslides across eastern sections of the island . The rains produced landslides , particularly in Saint Andrew Parish where six houses were destroyed . Elsewhere on the island , the mudslides caused further property damage and left some roads unpassable . Six people were killed throughout the country . The storm did not have significant impact in Cuba . A station in the mountains of what was then known as Oriente Province recorded winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . The city of Morón , located along the northern coast of Cuba , recorded 6 @.@ 13 inches ( 155 mm ) of rainfall in the 6 hour period prior to the storm passing the area . Damage was minor , limited to some crop damage in the eastern portion of the island , as well as power outages . The threat of the storm forced several thousand people to leave their homes . 
 In the Bahamas , officials closed schools , and many businesses closed early on the day the storm moved through the country . The storm 's stationary motion caused several days of high tides and heavy rains . Tropical storm force wind gusts were reported on Andros Island , and gusts peaked at 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) on Golden Cay . Gilda 's passage left crop damage on several islands , although monetary losses in the country were minor . 
 When Gilda was forecast to move near southeastern Florida , gale warnings were issued from North Key Largo to Fort Lauderdale . Rough seas affected the Florida coastline for about 72 hours , causing moderate coastal property damage and beach erosion . After becoming a large subtropical cyclone , gale warnings were issued at various times from Cape Hatteras , North Carolina to the mouth of the Merrimack River in Massachusetts . High surf and minor beach erosion were reported along the coastline , and gale force winds were observed from North Carolina to New Jersey . Over the western Atlantic Ocean , the storm produced strong winds and rough seas . One ship reported a wave height of 28 ft ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) , though no significant marine losses were reported . Around the time of it becoming extratropical , Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia recorded a wind gust of 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) . 
 Tropical Storm Gilda was notable as being the first observed tropical cyclone to transition into a subtropical cyclone ; several subtropical cyclones have undergone tropical cyclogenesis , but never the opposite . Since Gilda , a few other storms accomplished the feat . In 1980 , a tropical depression dissipated , reformed as a subtropical depression , and later became Hurricane Georges over the open Atlantic Ocean . The next year , Tropical Storm Jose became subtropical near the end of its duration , and in 1984 , Hurricane Klaus became a subtropical storm over the western Atlantic Ocean . In 2001 , Tropical Storm Allison , after causing devastating flooding in Texas , became a subtropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico and moved across much of the southeastern United States . In 2011 , Tropical Storm Lee transitioned into a subtropical storm while approaching Louisiana . 
 = S. O. Davies = 
 Stephen Owen Davies ( birth date uncertain , died 25 February 1972 ) , generally known as S. O. Davies , was a Welsh miner , trade union official and Labour Party politician , who served as the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Merthyr Tydfil from 1934 to 1972 . In 1970 , when well past 80 , he was deselected as parliamentary candidate by his local party association on account of his age . He fought the constituency in the 1970 general election as an Independent and won comfortably , a rare example in British politics of an independent candidate defeating a major party 's organisation . 
 Most official records show Davies 's birth date as November 1886 , but he is widely thought to have been born at least four years earlier . After leaving school aged 12 and working for some years in local pits , Davies studied mining engineering and later took an Arts degree at University College , Cardiff . He returned to the coalfields in 1913 , and established a reputation for militancy . In 1918 he was elected miners ' agent for the Dowlais district of the South Wales Miners ' Federation ( SWMF ) , and in 1924 was appointed SWMF 's chief organiser , legal adviser , and vice @-@ president . After a visit to Moscow in 1922 he became a firm defender of the Soviet Union , a position he maintained for the rest of his life . 
 After his election to parliament in 1934 , Davies was a consistent advocate for the interests of Merthyr Tydfil and the Welsh mining community . Largely indifferent to party discipline and official policy , among wider causes he championed were disarmament and Welsh nationalism , with a persistence that brought him several suspensions from the party and helped to ensure that he was never offered ministerial office . An immensely popular figure locally , he was regularly returned at general elections with large majorities . In 1966 , after an unstable colliery spoil tip collapsed on the village of Aberfan with the loss of 144 lives , Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe . He had not reported his suspicions , for fear that an enquiry would cause the closures of local pits . Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph , Davies died early in 1972 aged at least 85 and possibly 90 or more . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Birth , childhood and early career = = = 
 There is uncertainty about Davies 's date of birth . Most records say November 1886 , though usually with the caveat that he might have been born several years earlier . His birthplace was 39 John Street , <unk> ( then known as Cap Coch ) in the South Wales coalfields , the fourth child of Thomas Davies and his wife Esther . Thomas was a miner and trade union activist , who under the pseudonym Y <unk> ( " the Fox " ) wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper <unk> y <unk> ( " The Worker 's Shield " ) , in which he berated pit management and safety practices . His general militancy led to his blacklisting by pit owners , and after spells of unemployment he eventually found work as an insurance agent . 
 Davies attended the local Cap Coch school , leaving at the age of 12 , as was usual at that time , to begin work in the <unk> coal mine . He remained there until the mine was exhausted in 1905 , when he moved to Mountain Ash to work at Nixon 's Navigation Colliery . His ambition and intelligence were quickly recognised by his superiors , and he was encouraged to study mining engineering , at first locally in Aberdare and , in 1907 , at the Royal College of Science in London . In 1908 , with sponsorship from the Brecon Memorial College , he passed his matriculation and began studying for a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) degree at University College , Cardiff , with a view thereafter to entering the nonconformist ministry . However , Davies 's religious beliefs were influenced by R.J. Campbell , a noted preacher who rejected much traditional Christian teaching and asserted that socialism was the practical expression of Christianity . Davies 's association with such supposed heresies was unacceptable to the Brecon college , which withdrew its financial support . 
 Despite this loss of sponsorship , Davies completed his studies and graduated in 1913 . His plans to enter the ministry were abandoned ; he was an active member of the Independent Labour Party ( ILP ) , and his religious vocation had been replaced by a commitment to working @-@ class politics . In 1913 , while still a student , he stood for election to Cardiff 's Board of Guardians , as the ILP candidate in the Grangetown ward . This first foray into electoral politics ended in a narrow defeat , by 47 votes . 
 = = = <unk> and union official = = = 
 After graduation , Davies returned to work in the mines , initially at Tumble in the Gwendraeth Valley . In December 1913 he unsuccessfully sought election as miners ' sub @-@ agent for the Anthracite Miners ' district of the SWMF . When the First World War began in August 1914 he opposed it as capitalist militarism : " History teaches that war invariably brings in its wake a lower standard of morality , a restriction of the liberty of the masses , and a degradation of their social conditions " . In 1917 Davies founded and was first chairman of the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Trades and Labour Council . He was initially selected as the Labour candidate for the Llanelli constituency in the 1918 general election , but stood down when the SWMF backed his rival , J.H. Williams . 
 In 1918 Davies sought the position of miners ' agent for the Dowlais district of the SWMF . Against strong competition — his main opponent was William Mainwaring , later a long @-@ serving Labour MP for Rhondda East — Davies was victorious by 100 votes . The main role of the agent was to represent miners in disputes with their employers ; typically these would involve issues of pay , redundancy , working hours , and compensation for injuries . Davies 's surviving day books reveal the extent to which he was concerned with cases where the mining companies denied liability for underground injuries . 
 In 1919 Davies married Margaret ( " Madge " ) Eley from Cardiff ; three daughters were subsequently born . The years following the First World War saw economic decline and hardship in the South Wales coalfields , conditions which deepened Davies 's radical instincts , and he began to acquire a reputation for militancy . Contrary to mainstream Labour Party policy , Davies advocated workers ' control rather than the nationalisation of the mining industry . In 1921 he unsuccessfully advocated affiliation of the Miners ' Federation of Great Britain ( MFGB , precursor of the National Union of Mineworkers or NUM ) with the Red International of Labour Unions ( <unk> ) . The following year he was a delegate from the SWMF to the Second World Congress of the <unk> in Moscow , and acquired a warm sympathy towards the Soviet system . He did not , however , join the recently formed Communist Party of Great Britain , and remained within the Labour Party . 
 In 1924 Davies was appointed SWMF 's chief organiser and legal adviser , and was elected its vice @-@ president . He also served as the South Wales representative on the executive committee of the MFGB from 1924 to 1934 . During the May 1926 general strike , the South Wales miners were among the most fervent in support of the action . When the national strike collapsed after nine days , Davies led the continued resistance from the Welsh coalfields through months of lockout , before capitulation on harsh terms in December . Dowlais was the last district to return to work . The period following 1926 was marked by much in @-@ fighting between communist and non @-@ communist factions in the coalfields . Davies and other non @-@ communists found themselves accused of collaboration with " social fascism " ; a leaflet issued by the communist @-@ led National Minority Movement termed him " the sham militant " . Nevertheless , he continued to work for cooperation between all factions on the left . After Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 , Davies argued for unity around the Labour Party , believing that the ILP 's increasingly left @-@ wing stance , and the Communist Party 's commitment to violent revolution , might create the conditions for fascism . In 1931 Davies was elected to Merthyr Tydfil Borough Council .

 When Richard Wallhead , the Labour MP for Merthyr , died on 27 April 1934 , Davies was selected as the party 's candidate for the June by @-@ election , with the support of the MFGB . Wallhead had held the seat since 1922 , with large majorities ; in the 1931 general election he had defeated a single opponent , a candidate from Oswald Mosley 's New Party who had received tacit support from the Conservative Party . Davies faced opposition from the Liberal Party , the Communist Party and the ILP . With no candidate from the ruling National Government in the field , Davies was denied an obvious target for attack ; as the Manchester Guardian stated in its pre @-@ poll analysis , he was put on the defensive : " His is the dispiriting task of trying to lose as few votes as possible " . The paper predicted a close result . 
 Using the slogan " Peace , Prosperity , Security , Freedom " , Davies advocated the extension of public ownership , abolition of the means test , increased unemployment benefit , better education , and international co @-@ operation especially with Russia . He dismissed the ILP as having no function beyond the splitting of the Labour vote . With strong support from the local trade unions and helped by a well @-@ organised campaign , Davies swept to an easy victory on 5 June . His 18 @,@ 645 votes gave him a majority of 8 @,@ 269 over his Liberal opponent , with his ILP and Communist challengers lagging far behind .

 Davies gave his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 21 June 1934 . Breaking with the tradition that such speeches should be non @-@ partisan , he delivered a fierce attack on the government 's policy towards the mining industry . He had come , he said , from a coalfield that " has had very little help from the present government ... we see communities with a great industrial history dissolving and disintegrating " . An uncompromising approach on any questions affecting Merthyr Tydfil , or the mining industry generally , became Davies 's parliamentary hallmark . In December 1934 he rebuked the veteran Conservative MP Nancy Astor when she referred to Merthyr as having " no social consciousness or initiative to do anything " . Davies replied : " I object to irresponsible and brutal charges coming from people whose knowledge is derived from the enjoyment of vast wealth , especially when I am not certain that they have made their contribution towards producing that wealth " . 
 In 1934 , two years after his wife Margaret 's death from cancer , Davies married Sephora Davies , a schoolteacher from <unk> @-@ Cae @-@ <unk> in Carmarthenshire who shared Davies 's political outlook . The couple lived at <unk> Park Terrace in Merthyr Tydfil , and had two sons . In November 1936 , having been returned in the 1935 general election with an increased majority , Davies ridiculed the prime minister , Stanley Baldwin , for his refusal to meet a delegation from the National Unemployed Workers ' Movement 's 1936 Hunger March , which included a large contingent from South Wales : " A bigger man would meet these people who have tramped the roads of this country and would show that he had sympathy with them " . In 1938 , having modified his earlier position , Davies supported a bill introduced by the Labour opposition for the nationalisation of the coal industry . Miners worked , he said , in intolerable conditions to ensure that cheap raw material was available to industry . Reasonable wages and working conditions would never be granted by private coal @-@ owners . The bill was defeated . 
 As Europe moved towards war in the late 1930s , Davies opposed the appeasement policies of the Chamberlain government . He doubted the will of the British ruling classes to wage a determined war against fascism , and called for a workers ' " Popular Front " of resistance to the dictators . After the outbreak of war in September 1939 Davies demanded from the British government " a more specific and detailed statement " of war aims , to allay " suspicions ... as to the real and possibly as yet unstated war aims of this country and of France " . He criticised Labour 's decision in May 1940 to join Churchill 's wartime coalition government , and thereafter opposed many of the coalition 's domestic policies , such as indiscriminate internment of aliens , restrictions on industrial action , and the suppression of the communist newspaper the Daily Worker . The bitterness of Davies 's personal attack on Herbert Morrison , the Home Secretary who had authorised the paper 's closure , shocked even the British Communist Party 's general secretary , Harry Pollitt , who cautioned Davies that " personal abuse has been our stock @-@ in @-@ trade for twenty years and has got us nowhere " . 
 Unlike the British communists , Davies did not change his position when the Soviet Union entered the war in June 1941 . He continued to oppose all co @-@ operation with the Conservatives , believing that only through socialism could a just and lasting peace be achieved . Victory in 1945 , and the subsequent election of a Labour government , did little to affect Davies 's individualism . In the Labour years 1945 – 51 he opposed government policies on conscription , NATO , the development of nuclear weapons , and intervention in the Korean War . According to his biographer Robert Griffiths , it was hatred of capitalist militarism , rather than a wish to support the Soviet Union , that underlay Davies 's stances . His popularity in South Wales was unaffected : he was returned to parliament in each postwar election with large majorities . In 1945 – 46 he served as Merthyr Tydfil 's mayor , remaining on the local council until 1949 . 
 = = = = Labour rebel = = = = 
 In assessing Davies 's political career the historian Alun Morgan notes certain inconsistencies : while calling for unity among leftist factions , Davies frequently rebelled against agreed Labour Party policies . He championed democracy , individual liberty and the rights of small nations , yet gave the Soviet Union his unvarying and uncritical support . However , he was consistent in certain core areas , often in defiance of official Labour policy : unremitting hostility to US foreign policy , opposition to UK defence expenditure , and above all commitment to the needs and interests of his Merthyr constituents . His dedication to his own agenda brought him into frequent conflict with party managers , and led to withdrawals of the party whip throughout the 1950s and 1960s . Stating his position in a 1948 letter to the Labour Party general secretary Morgan Phillips , he wrote : " Our movement embraces millions of men and women , and not merely a few hundred MPs and a few dozen ... members of the National Executive . I am habitually inclined to give our millions my first thoughts and consideration . " Davies 's popularity with the voters of Merthyr Tydfil remained constant ; he secured 75 per cent or more of the vote in each of the general elections of 1955 , 1959 , 1964 and 1966 . 
 In December 1951 Sephora Davies was expelled from the Labour Party because of her close association with a proscribed organisation , the British Soviet Friendship Society . Davies 's deep roots in the Labour movement , and his large base of local support , saved him from a similar fate . In June 1953 he was attacked by Will Lawther , the NUM president , for defying the Labour Party 's position and supporting the Soviet claim that a workers ' rising in East Germany had been orchestrated by " a CIA @-@ sponsored West @-@ German pro @-@ fascist organisation " . Lawther demanded that the local Merthyr Tydfil party <unk> Davies as their parliamentary candidate , but they stood firm . 
 Davies found himself again at odds with his party , over the issue of Welsh self @-@ government . He had championed this cause for many years , to the annoyance of Labour 's Welsh Regional Council . In May 1954 he offered proposals for a Welsh parliament that were rejected by the Regional Council and by the South Wales Area conference of the NUM . Davies persevered , and on 4 March 1955 introduced in the House of Commons a private member 's bill proposing self @-@ government for Wales on the basis of the aborted 1914 act that would have granted home rule to Ireland . Davies claimed to have received thousands of messages of support for his measure , from all parts of Wales , but in the House he could only muster 14 votes in favour . Undeterred , he told MPs : " There is a movement in Wales , an uprising , as it were , that will not only support the bill but will continue to insist upon it until Wales is represented in the United Kingdom as something more than a mere region . " 
 According to Griffiths , when Soviet troops suppressed the Hungarian uprising in October 1956 , Davies was troubled , but refused to join in the general censure lest this give comfort to the enemies of socialism . He was to be equally silent during and after the events of the Prague Spring of 1968 — in sharp contrast to his condemnation of the " criminally dangerous and irresponsible heroics " of the United States during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 . In 1961 , at the request of the Labour Party leadership , Davies was one of 25 Labour MPs and party members investigated by the British security services as a possible Communist Party member . The MI5 report stated that there was evidence to indicate that Davies , " if not of the Party ... is at least very close to it indeed " . 
 = = Aberfan = = 
 Davies 's Merthyr constituency included the mining village of Aberfan , situated a few miles south of Merthyr Tydfil . On the mountainsides above the village , colliery waste had been dumped over the years to form large spoil tips . Shortly after 9 : 00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of these tips collapsed , sending thousands of tons of semi @-@ liquid waste hurtling towards Aberfan . The point of impact was <unk> Junior School , where morning lessons were beginning . The school was half submerged ; inside , 109 children and 5 teachers were killed . A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school , in the streets or adjoining houses . In the immediate aftermath , Davies visited and consoled the bereaved families in Aberfan , and on the Saturday he led a party which included the Duke of Edinburgh on a tour of the disaster site . 
 On 24 October , the National Coal Board chairman Lord <unk> stated that the cause of the landslip was a previously unknown spring , which had been pouring water into the centre of the tip , creating a " water bomb " . Local miners disagreed ; they said that the spring 's existence had been known when tipping began 20 years earlier . A tribunal was set up under Lord Justice Edmund Davies , to investigate the disaster . 
 Giving evidence to the tribunal , S. O. Davies said he had long suspected that the Aberfan tips were unstable , but had kept quiet for fear that if tipping was stopped on the mountainside the Coal Board would close the colliery . Davies added : " But if I had been asked to do so , I would have done it " . His testimony was strongly challenged by the NUM , whose counsel Brian Gibbens QC said that " [ i ] f Mr Davies is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection ... then he bears what must be one of the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster " . However , Gibbens found it incredible that a man in Davies 's unique local position of authority and influence would not have mentioned his fears to any of the formal bodies — borough council , Coal Board , union or local Labour Party : " If anyone could have exercised influence to overcome an obdurate or ignorant monolith like the Coal Board , [ Davies ] was well placed to do so . " Gibbens submitted that Davies 's testimony should be rejected , on the grounds that he " never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words " . The tribunal concurred , accepting that Davies had not fully understood the gravity of his admission , and adding that had they been convinced otherwise , he could not have escaped censure . The tribunal 's findings , published in July 1967 , placed responsibility for the disaster firmly on the National Coal Board , specifically on the absence of any tipping policy .

 In December 1966 Davies introduced a bill to the House of Commons , to provide more generous compensation to miners suffering from dust @-@ related diseases . The bill was accepted by Harold Wilson 's Labour government , and became law in 1967 . This was one of the few instances during this period in which Davies and the Labour government worked together . Following the Coal Board 's refusal to meet the full cost of removing the remaining Aberfan tips , Wilson proposed that part of the required £ 750 @,@ 000 be met by the disaster fund set up to help the people of Aberfan rebuild their community . Davies was outraged ; he told Wilson : " I have never known a prime minister to behave so disgracefully in all my 34 years in the House of Commons " . Subsequently , Davies opposed the 1969 decision of Merthyr Tydfil Council to award Wilson the freedom of the borough , stating that he would boycott the ceremony . 
 While many constituents supported Davies in his frequent attacks on government policies , the local Labour Party became increasingly concerned by his activities . By the late 1960s many of them were from a younger generation , with no experience of the shared hardships of the 1920s and 1930s , and with a less parochial mindset . They were angered by what they perceived as Davies 's disloyalty to the Wilson government , elected in 1964 after thirteen years of opposition , and his penchant for following his own agenda . There was also the question of his age ; in 1970 he was supposedly 83 , but rumours that he was older were widespread . By March 1970 the local party discussed replacing Davies as their candidate at the next general election , citing his age rather than policy disagreements . The National Executive of the party sanctioned this action , and at a special meeting on 10 May , which Davies declined to attend , he was formally deselected . 
 = = = 1970 election = = = 
 Davies reacted to his deselection by announcing that the people of Merthyr , not the local Labour Party , would decide his future . If physically fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist . Friends advised him not to risk humiliation ; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine , and Davies would , they predicted , get no more than 1 @,@ 000 votes . Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election , which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate . They chose Tal Lloyd , an Amalgamated Engineering Union ( <unk> ) official , a long @-@ serving councillor and a former mayor , on the moderate wing of the Labour Party , and a strong supporter of Wilson . 
 With no party organisation and only his own financial resources , Davies 's campaign was initially very low @-@ key . His election literature was a single sheet with the message " You Know Me , I 've Never Let You Down " . As polling day approached , however , it was clear that he was gathering support , particularly among the young — a great irony , Alun Morgan observes , for a man sacked on the grounds of his age . In the final week before polling day on 18 June Davies 's youthful supporters toured the constituency with songs , slogans and cheerleaders in what Griffiths describes as " the most colourful election <unk> seen in Merthyr for 40 years " . The official Labour campaign stalled , as Lloyd became embroiled in a row over his role in the failure of the <unk> to support an unofficial strike at the local Hoover factory . On polling day , amid scenes of jubilation . Davies was returned with a majority of 7 @,@ 467 over Lloyd . Davies responded to his victory by thanking the voters whom , he said , he had never thought for a moment would let him down . Two weeks later Davies and his principal campaign workers were expelled from the Labour Party for opposing its official candidate . The national leadership refused his request for an official enquiry into the actions of the Merthyr party , in the selection process and during the election itself . 
 = = = Final years and death = = = 
 Despite his expulsion , in July 1970 the Labour @-@ controlled Merthyr council offered Davies the freedom of the borough , an honour which he politely declined ; the confidence of the people recently shown him was , he said , enough . He resumed his place in parliament , on the opposition benches as Labour had unexpectedly lost the election to Edward Heath 's Conservatives . Despite some ill @-@ feeling , Davies was not ostracised by his erstwhile colleagues , and was unofficially briefed by the party . He limited his Commons appearances and rarely spoke in debates , generally preferring to serve his constituents from home . On the major national issue of the 1970 – 74 parliament — Heath 's renewed bid for Britain 's membership of the European Economic Community ( EEC ) — Davies voiced uncompromising opposition . In a letter to the South Wales Echo on 9 August 1971 he challenged the government 's claim that " our security has been bound up with our European neighbours for over a thousand years " , pointing out Britain 's <unk> in numerous European wars , " including the Hitler war when British security meant co @-@ operation with Russia " . 
 On 22 February 1972 Davies attended parliament to vote against the government on an EEC @-@ related motion . He returned to Merthyr suffering from a chest infection , took to his bed on 24th , and on 25th was transferred to Merthyr General Hospital where he died later that day . His funeral was held at Soar @-@ <unk> chapel , Merthyr on 29 February , followed by burial at the Maes @-@ Yr @-@ Arian Cemetery at nearby Mountain Ash . Griffiths records : " It was indicative of [ Davies 's ] breadth of vision that the ceremony attracted socialists , communists , Welsh nationalists , republicans , and many of no political creed at all " . In the April by @-@ election to fill the vacancy caused by Davies 's death the Labour candidate , Ted Rowlands , won the seat with a narrow majority over Plaid Cymru . 
 = = Tributes = = 
 According to a BBC correspondent Davies " looked as if he belonged to a different age , in his parliamentary ' uniform ' of Homburg hat , silk scarf , black jacket and pin @-@ striped trousers " . Two close Merthyr friends who had followed him out of the Labour Party described him as " [ a ] tall man who walked tall and never bowed to anyone , but treated everyone alike . " His obituarist in The Times referred to his deceptively mild outward demeanour , " but underneath , fires were forever smouldering " . 
 Many of the tributes paid to Davies after his death acknowledged his commitment to Merthyr and the mining communities of the Welsh valleys , for whom he was an unfailing advocate . The mayor of Merthyr remarked that he was " an individualist who followed the teaching of ' Love thy neighbour as thyself ' . He was highly respected by all , even by those who didn 't agree with him " . His parliamentary colleague and fellow <unk> Jim Griffiths , who had shared with Davies the leadership of the South Wales miners after the 1926 general strike , thought that had Davies cultivated an ability for compromise , he would have achieved ministerial office . But " he always was a lone figure ... and seemed to like being in isolation . " In April 2013 a heritage plaque in Davies 's honour was unveiled at Penydarren Park , Merthyr Tydfil . On 5 August 2015 , as part of the De Montfort Project celebrating the 750th anniversary of Simon de Montfort 's parliament , Davies 's parliamentary work was recognised in special events at Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil . 
 The Revd Islwyn Jones , who conducted Davies 's funeral service , said : " He had a great love for man , he believed with the <unk> that ' The earth is the Lord 's and the fulness thereof ' , and it was these words , sinking deep into his heart , which made him ' take up the cudgels for the common man ' " .

 = Bill Harry = 
 Bill Harry ( born 17 September 1938 ) , is the creator of Mersey Beat ; a newspaper of the early 1960s which focused on the Liverpool music scene . Harry had previously started various magazines and newspapers , such as <unk> and Premier , while at Liverpool 's Junior School of Art . He later attended the Liverpool College of Art , where his fellow students included John Lennon and Stuart Sutcliffe , who both later performed with the Beatles . He published a magazine , Jazz , in 1958 , and worked as an assistant editor on the University of Liverpool 's charity magazine , Pantosphinx . 
 Harry met his wife @-@ to @-@ be , Virginia Sowry , at the Jacaranda club — managed by Allan Williams , the first manager of the Beatles — and she later agreed to help him start a music newspaper . After borrowing £ 50 , Harry released the first issue of Mersey Beat on 6 July 1961 , with the first 5 @,@ 000 copies selling out within a short time . The newspaper was published every two weeks , covering the music scenes in Liverpool , Wirral , Birkenhead , New Brighton , Crosby and Southport , as well as Warrington , Widnes and Runcorn . He edited the paper in a small attic office above a wine merchant 's shop at 81a Renshaw Street , Liverpool . 
 Harry arranged for the future Beatles ' manager , Brian Epstein , to see them perform a lunchtime concert at the Cavern Club on 9 November 1961 . Epstein subsequently asked Harry to create a national music paper , the Music Echo , but after disagreements with Epstein about editorial control , he decided to become a P.R. agent ; working for many solo artistes and groups , including Pink Floyd , Jethro Tull , Procol Harum , David Bowie , Led Zeppelin and the Beach Boys , as well as many others . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Harry was born in Smithdown Road Hospital ( now demolished ) , in Liverpool , Lancashire , on 17 September 1938 . He came from a poor Liverpudlian background and was brought up in a rough neighbourhood near Liverpool 's dockyards . His father ( John <unk> Harry ) , was killed during the war on the SS <unk> British Steam Merchant ship , which was torpedoed in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean by a German U @-@ boat . None of the crew survived , and Harry 's father died on 14 December 1940 , aged 25 . Harry attended the Catholic St. Vincent 's Institute , but had to get used to the priests dispensing corporal punishment on a regular basis . Because of his small stature , Harry was beaten by his classmates , being once kicked in the appendix and " left for dead " . His mother had no option but to transfer him elsewhere . 
 Harry became interested in science fiction and read comics by candlelight ( as the house had no electricity ) , eventually joining the Liverpool Science Fiction Society . At the age of 13 , he produced his own science fiction fanzine , <unk> , using a <unk> machine to print 60 copies . His pen friend at the time was Michael Moorcock ; the writer of science fiction and fantasy novels . After winning a scholarship to the Junior School of Art in Gambier Terrace , Liverpool , Harry started his first school newspaper , Premier . 
 = = = Liverpool College of Art = = = 
 At the age of 16 , Harry obtained a place at Liverpool 's College of Art at 68 Hope Street . After studying typography and page layouts , he borrowed the college 's duplicating machine and published a newspaper called Jazz in 1958 , which reported concerts at the Liverpool Jazz Society club , the Temple Jazz Club and the Cavern Club . He also worked as assistant editor on University of Liverpool 's charity magazine , Pantosphinx , and on a music newsletter for Frank <unk> 's musical instruments store called Frank Comments . The title was suggested by the owner , Frank <unk> , as a play on his own comments , but was abandoned after a few issues . 
 Harry received a National Diploma in design while at the Liverpool Art College and became the first student in the new Graphic Design course , eventually winning a Senior City Art Scholarship . Harry maintained that students at art college should be bohemian in their thoughts and actions and not like the " <unk> and <unk> " , whom Harry disapproved of for wearing duffle coats and turtle neck sweaters . One of the college 's artists and teachers , Arthur Ballard , later stated that Harry and Sutcliffe both overshadowed Lennon at college , explaining that they were both " extremely well educated , and very eager for information " . Harry organised a students ' film society , where he showed <unk> , by Jean Cocteau and Salvador Dalí , and Luis Buñuel 's , L 'Age d 'Or . 
 Meeting Lennon had been a shock for Harry , as Lennon often dressed like a Teddy boy , and was a disruptive influence at the college . Despite his misgivings about Lennon , Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe , who was a small , softly @-@ spoken and shy student , who had painted a portrait of Harry . The three often spent time together at the Ye <unk> pub in Rice Street , or on the top floor of the Jacaranda club ( run by Williams , who later managed the Beatles ) . Harry met his then 16 @-@ year @-@ old future wife @-@ to @-@ be , Virginia Sowry , at the club . Harry , Lennon , Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960 . Having been disappointed with Ellis ' performance , Harry proposed the idea that they should call the assembled quartet of friends the Dissenters , and make Liverpool famous : Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings , Harry 's writing and Lennon 's music . 
 = = = Music and journalism = = = 
 A fellow student , John Ashcroft , introduced Harry to rock ' n ' roll records , and the members of Rory Storm & the Hurricanes and Cass & the <unk> . Harry carried notebooks with him , collecting information about the local groups , once writing to the Daily Mail : " Liverpool is like New Orleans at the turn of the century , but with rock ' n ' roll instead of jazz " . He also wrote to the Liverpool Echo about the emerging Liverpool music scene , but neither paper was interested in stories about music that was popular with teenagers . The classified ads in the Liverpool Echo for local groups were always under the heading of Jazz , but the paper refused to change this policy , despite pleas from the promoters and groups who actually paid for them . Harry planned to produce a jazz newspaper called Storyville / 52nd Street and contacted Sam Leach , the owner of a club called Storyville . Leach promised to fund the newspaper , but failed to turn up for three meetings with Harry , leaving him no other option but to find another investor . Harry thought starting a fortnightly newspaper covering Liverpool 's rock ' n ' roll music scene would be more successful , and would differ from national music newspapers such as the New Musical Express and the Melody Maker , which only wrote articles about current chart hits and artists . 
 = = Mersey Beat = = 
 Photographer Dick Matthews , a friend from the Jacaranda , heard about Harry 's problems with Leach and introduced Harry to a local civil servant , Jim Anderson , who lent Harry £ 50 . This enabled Harry to found Mersey Beat in 1961 . Harry decided to publish the newspaper every two weeks , covering the music scene in Liverpool , Wirral , Birkenhead , New Brighton , Crosby and Southport , as well as Warrington , Widnes and Runcorn . He thought up the name Mersey Beat by thinking about a policeman 's ' beat ' ( the area of duty ) , which had nothing to do with a musical beat . Virginia gave up her accountancy / <unk> operator job at Woolworth 's and worked full @-@ time for £ 2 @.@ 10 / - a week ( also contributing a Mersey Roundabout article ) , while Harry lived on his Senior City Art Scholarship funding . Matthews photographed groups , while Anderson found a small attic office for £ 5 a week above David Land 's wine merchant 's shop at 81a Renshaw Street , Liverpool . Anderson and Matthews helped with the move to the new office , with Anderson providing a desk , chair and an Olivetti typewriter . 
 Harry asked printer James E. James ( who had printed Frank Comments ) , if he could borrow the printing blocks he used for photos , as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time . Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News , Pantosphinx and local cinemas , but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements at the side of the front cover page . After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening , Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night , pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie at four in the morning . Virginia 's parents helped the paper during this time , as they paid for classified ads , and arranged for Harry and his future wife 's first photographs together . 
 = = = The first issue = = = 
 Splitting the price of the newspaper ( three pence ) , with retailers , Harry arranged for three major wholesalers , W.H. Smith , Blackburn 's and Conlan 's , to sell Mersey Beat . Harry personally delivered copies to more than 20 newsagents as well as to local venues and musical instrument and record stores , such as Cramer & Lea , Rushworth & Draper and Cranes . The paper released its first edition on 6 July 1961 , selling out all 5 @,@ 000 copies . The paper 's circulation increased rapidly as Harry started featuring stories about groups in Manchester , Birmingham , Sheffield and Newcastle , with circulation growing to 75 @,@ 000 . As the newspaper 's sales rose , it became known as the " Teenagers Bible " . Local groups were soon being called " beat groups " , and venues started advertising concerts as " Beat Sessions " . With circulation rising , the paper 's offices were moved downstairs to a larger two @-@ roomed office . The Cavern Club 's doorman , Pat ( Paddy ) Delaney , was employed to deliver copies , a secretary , Pat Finn , was hired , as well as Raymond Caine to promote advertising space , 
 Harry later said : " The newspapers , television , theatres and radio were all run by people of a different generation who had no idea of what youngsters wanted . For decades they had manipulated and controlled them . Suddenly , there was an awareness of being young , and young people wanted their own styles and their own music , just at the time they were beginning to earn money , which gave them the spending power . Mersey Beat was their voice , it was a paper for them , crammed with photos and information about their own groups , which is why it also began to appeal to youngsters throughout Britain as its coverage extended to other areas . " Because of the employment situation in Liverpool at the time , The Daily Worker newspaper denounced the enthusiasm of younger people in Liverpool by saying " The Mersey Sound is the sound of 30 @,@ 000 people on the dole . " 
 = = = Liverpool groups = = = 
 Between 1958 and 1964 , the Merseyside area had about 500 different groups , which were constantly forming and breaking up , with an average of about 350 groups playing concerts on a regular basis . In 1961 , Harry and the Cavern Club 's DJ , Bob Wooler , compiled a list of groups that they had personally heard of , which had almost 300 names . In 1962 , Mersey Beat held a poll to find out who was the most popular Merseyside group . When the votes were counted , Rory Storm & the Hurricanes were in first place , but after looking through the postal votes again , Harry noticed that forty votes were all written in green ink , in the same handwriting , and from the same area of Liverpool , so the dubious votes were declared void . This was suspected to have been Storm himself , but Harry had no idea that the Beatles had done exactly the same thing . 
 The results were announced on 4 January 1962 , with the Beatles in first place . The results were printed in issue 13 of Mersey Beat on 4 January 1962 , with the front page announcing , " Beatles Top Poll ! " Such was the popularity of the poll , Rushworth 's music store manager , Bob Hobbs , presented Lennon and George Harrison with new guitars . At the time , many groups in Liverpool complained to Harry that his newspaper should be called Mersey Beatles , as he featured them so often . 
 Harry asked a local singer , Priscilla White , to contribute a fashion column after writing an article called " Swinging Cilla " , in which he wrote , " Cilla Black is a Liverpool girl who is starting out on the road to fame . " Harry 's mistake came about because he could not remember her surname ( which he knew was a colour ) , but White decided to keep it as a stage name . Two years later Harry arranged for her to sing for Epstein at the Blue Angel club , leading to a management contract . 
 In late 1962 , Harry wrote an article called " Take a look up North " , asking for A & R men from London to travel up to Liverpool and see what was really happening with the music scene , but not one record company sent an A & R representative to Liverpool . Journalist Nancy Spain once wrote an article for the News of the World newspaper , stating that " Bill and Virginia Harry were Mr. & Mrs. Mersey Beat " , and when Bob Dylan visited Liverpool to appear at the Odeon , he specifically asked for Harry to act as his guide to the city .

 Harry often heard Lennon , McCartney and Harrison rehearsing or playing in the Art College canteen in the basement , but after Sutcliffe joined the Quarrymen , Harry complained that Sutcliffe should be concentrating on art and not music , as he thought he was a competent , but not brilliant bassist . As Harry and Sutcliffe were members of the Liverpool College of Art 's Student Union committee , they put forward the idea that the college should buy its own P.A. system for college dances , which the Quarrymen often played at , but the equipment would later be appropriated by the group and taken to Hamburg . As late as 7 March 1962 , the Students ' Union sent Pete Mackey to ask Lennon to either return the equipment or pay for it , but Lennon told him it had been sold in Hamburg . Harry asked Lennon to write a short biography of the Beatles for the first issue of Mersey Beat , which Harry titled , " Being a Short Diversion on the Dubious Origins of Beatles , Translated From the [ sic ] John Lennon " : 
 Lennon was very grateful that Harry printed his ' Dubious Origins ' piece without editing it and later gave Harry a large collection of drawings , poems and stories ( approximately 250 ) , telling Harry he was free to publish whatever he liked ( under the pseudonym of " <unk> " , which was appropriated from a Daily Express column , Beachcomber ) . 
 Harry convinced Epstein to sell 12 copies of the first Mersey Beat newspaper at his North End Music Stores ( NEMS ) , which sold out in one day , resulting in Epstein having to order more copies . After ordering and selling 144 copies of the second issue , Epstein invited Harry to his office for a glass of sherry , proposing the idea that he ( Epstein ) , should write a record review column . It was published in the third issue on 3 August 1961 , entitled " Stop the World — And Listen To Everything in It : Brian Epstein of NEMS " . Epstein saw numerous posters around Liverpool advertising concerts by the Beatles as well as in the second issue of Mersey Beat , which had " Beatles sign Recording Contract ! " on the front cover , as the Beatles had recorded the " My Bonnie " single with Tony Sheridan in Germany . Some months after its release , Epstein supposedly ( as stated in his biography ) , asked his assistant Alistair Taylor about the single , because a customer , one Raymond Jones , had asked Epstein for the single on 28 October 1961 , which made Epstein curious about the group . Harry and McCartney repudiated this story , as Harry had been talking to Epstein about the Beatles for a long time ( being the group he promoted the most in Mersey Beat ) , and by McCartney saying , " Brian [ Epstein ] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were , they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat . " 
 The Beatles were due to perform a lunchtime concert at the Cavern Club on 9 November 1961 , not far from Epstein 's NEMS store . Epstein asked Harry to arrange for him and Taylor to watch the Beatles perform without queuing at the door . Harry phoned the owner , Ray McFall , who said he would inform the doorman on the day , Delaney , to let Epstein in . Epstein and Taylor bypassed the line of fans at the door and heard a welcome message announced over the club 's public @-@ address system by Wooler : " We have someone rather famous in the audience today , Mr. Brian Epstein , the owner of NEMS ... " 
 Lennon had once given Harry a collection of photos taken in Hamburg , showing Lennon standing on the Reeperbahn reading a newspaper and wearing nothing but his underpants , performing on stage with a toilet seat around his neck , and one of McCartney sitting on a toilet . After Epstein became the Beatles ' manager , Lennon rushed into Harry 's office and asked for them back , saying , " Brian [ Epstein ] insists I 've got to get them back — the pictures , everything you 've got . I must take it all with me now . " When Epstein finally secured a recording contract with EMI , he sent Harry a telegram from London to the Mersey Beat office to announce the news . 
 = = = The last issues and London = = = 
 On 13 September 1964 , Epstein approached Harry to create a national music paper , so Harry coined the name Music Echo , and gradually merged Mersey Beat into it . Epstein had promised Harry full editorial control , but then hired a female press officer in London to write a fashion column and a D.J. to write a gossip column , without informing Harry of his intentions , leaving Harry with no other option but to resign . The paper subsequently ran into financial problems , and Epstein had to merge it with another paper , becoming the Disc & Music Echo . When Harry and his wife moved to London in 1966 , he was already contributing a column for the magazine Weekend and also for the teen magazines Marilyn and Valentine . He then became the feature writer , news editor and columnist for Record Mirror ( using various pseudonyms such as ' Brenda Tarry ' and ' David <unk> ' ) , and wrote features for Music Now ( under the name of Nick Blaine ) for Record Retailer .

 Harry and his wife moved to London in 1966 and was engaged as a public relations ( P.R. ) for the Kinks and the Hollies . During the next 18 years he was the P.R. to many artists , including Pink Floyd , Jethro Tull , Procol Harum , David Bowie , Led Zeppelin , the Beach Boys , Clouds , Ten Years After , Free , Mott the Hoople , the Pretty Things , Christine Perfect , Supertramp , Hot Chocolate , Suzi Quatro and Kim Wilde . During his time working as a press officer , Harry started a monthly magazine called Tracks , which reported the latest album releases , and another magazine , Idols : 20th Century Legends , which ran for 37 issues , from 1988 to 1991 . Harry also compiled a 34 @-@ track compilation , Mersey Beat , for Parlophone records , which was released on 31 October 1983 . 
 Harry was presented with a gold award for a ' Lifetime Achievement in Music ' by the British Academy of Songwriters , Composers and Authors ( <unk> ) in 1994 , has taken part in over 350 international television / radio shows , and was hired by Rediffusion to be programme assistant for the documentary Beat City . He was a programme assistant for the BBC 's Everyman documentary about Lennon : A Day in the Life , and The Story of Mersey Beat . The British Council asked him to represent them in Hong Kong , promoting the Beatles . Mersey Beat returned to publication in August 2009 with a 24 @-@ page special issue to celebrate the Liverpool International Beatle Week . He was an Associate Producer of the film The City That Rocked the World . Harry and Virginia have a son , Sean Harry , who is an adult movie actor , director , and producer .

 = 1995 Pacific Grand Prix = 
 The 1995 Pacific Grand Prix ( formally the II Pacific Grand Prix ) was a Formula One motor race held on 22 October 1995 at the TI Circuit , Aida , Japan . It was the fifteenth round of the 1995 Formula One season . The 83 @-@ lap race was won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after starting from third position . David Coulthard , who started the Grand Prix from pole position , finished second in a Williams car , with Damon Hill third in the other Williams . Schumacher 's win confirmed him as 1995 Drivers ' Champion , as Hill could not pass Schumacher 's points total with only two races remaining . This was also the last race for Jean @-@ Christophe Boullion . 
 Hill started the race alongside Coulthard on the front row , amidst pressure from the British media for not being " forceful " enough in battles . Schumacher attempted to drive around the outside of Hill at the first corner , but Hill held Schumacher off as Jean Alesi , driving for Ferrari , got past both on the inside line to take second position . As a result , Hill dropped down to third and Schumacher dropped down to fifth behind Gerhard Berger . Schumacher managed to get past Alesi and Hill during the first of three pit stops . This allowed him , on a new set of slick tyres , to close on Coulthard who was on a two @-@ stop strategy . Schumacher opened up a gap of 21 seconds by lapping two seconds faster per lap than Coulthard , so that when his third stop came , he still led the race . 
 = = Report = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The race , originally scheduled to be held as the third round of the season on 16 April 1995 , was moved to October as the local infrastructure and communications were badly damaged from the Great Hanshin earthquake . 
 Heading into the 15th race of the season , Benetton driver Michael Schumacher was leading the Drivers ' Championship with 82 points ; Williams driver Damon Hill was second on 55 points , 27 points behind Schumacher . A maximum of 30 points were available for the remaining three races , which meant that Hill could still win the title . Schumacher only needed a fourth @-@ place finish to become Drivers ' Champion as , even if Hill won , Schumacher would be more than 20 points ahead of Hill with two races remaining . Behind Hill and Schumacher in the Drivers ' Championship , David Coulthard was third on 43 points in a Williams , with Johnny Herbert and Jean Alesi both on 40 points . In the Constructors ' Championship , Benetton were leading on 112 points and Williams were second on 92 points , with a maximum of 48 points available . In the two weeks leading up to the race , there was heavy criticism towards Damon Hill , with pundits feeling that Hill had not been " forceful " enough in his battle at the European Grand Prix against Schumacher . In an interview leading up to the race , part @-@ time Ligier driver Martin Brundle said : 
 Damon has to do two things . First , he has to establish himself as the <unk> at Williams for next year so the team can give him their full support . Second , he has to re @-@ establish himself as a racer . Maybe he needs to lose a front wheel once or twice to re @-@ establish himself . 
 Schumacher , his title @-@ rival , said that Hill made " half @-@ hearted attempts " to overtake , which led to him " getting into trouble " . The comments were prompted after a series of battles between Hill and Schumacher in previous race meetings , most notably at the Belgian Grand Prix , where Hill accused Schumacher of blocking him . At a Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ) World Motor Sport Council meeting on October 19 to discuss driver etiquette , they opted against introducing new rules on the issue . Formula One 's governing body emphasised that the International Sporting Code would be enforced on the basis that drivers are free to drive as they wish " provided they do not deliberately endanger another driver or repeatedly obstruct him on a straight " , following incidents during the year involving Hill and Schumacher . 
 Williams were favourites to win the race due to the nature of the track — their Williams FW17 car was more suited to high @-@ downforce tracks like Aida , and thus had the advantage over Benetton . In an attempt to match the pace of the Williams cars , Benetton introduced a revised rear suspension geometry to the Benetton B195 for the race . 
 There were five driver changes heading into the race . Having been in one of the two Ligier cars since the tenth race of the season at Germany , Martin Brundle was replaced by Aguri Suzuki as part of the two sharing the drive for the season . Jan Magnussen was drafted into the McLaren team to replace Mika Häkkinen because of the Finn 's operation for appendicitis . The third driver change was Ukyo Katayama 's return to Tyrrell after missing the European Grand Prix due to a crash at the Portuguese Grand Prix . Gianni Morbidelli returned to the Footwork team replacing Max Papis , while at Pacific , Bertrand Gachot came back to replace Jean @-@ Denis Délétraz , both men having driven for these teams at the start of the season . Délétraz was replaced as he had not made agreed payment instalments to the Pacific team for the privilege of the drive . Pacific had originally intended to run local driver Katsumi Yamamoto in place of Délétraz , but he was not granted an FIA Super Licence and so Gachot retook the seat . Similarly , the Forti team 's plans to replace Roberto Moreno with Hideki Noda came to nought for the same reason , even though Noda had started three Grands Prix for the Larrousse team the previous year . 
 = = = Practice and qualifying = = = 
 Two practice sessions were held before the race ; the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Saturday morning . Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes with weather conditions dry throughout . Schumacher set the fastest time in the first session , posting a lap of 1 : 16 @.@ 057 , three @-@ tenths of a second quicker than Hill and Coulthard , in second and third places respectively . The Ferrari cars were fourth and fifth fastest ; Gerhard Berger ahead of Jean Alesi , with McLaren driver Mark Blundell rounding out the top six . Coulthard lapped faster than Schumacher in the second practice session with a time of 1 : 15 @.@ 730 . Hill was second in the Williams , three @-@ tenths of a second behind Coulthard . Eddie Irvine in the Jordan car was fourth , seven @-@ tenths behind Coulthard . He was split by the Ferraris who were third and fifth ; Alesi in front of Berger . The Benetton cars were sixth and seventh ; Schumacher in front of Herbert . Heinz @-@ Harald Frentzen and Jean @-@ Christophe Boullion were eighth and tenth in the Saubers , with Rubens Barrichello ninth in the Jordan , two seconds off the pace . 
 The qualifying session was split into two one @-@ hour sessions ; the first was held on Friday afternoon with the second held on Saturday afternoon . The fastest time from either sessions counted towards their final grid position . Coulthard clinched his fourth consecutive pole position , in his Williams , with a time of 1 : 14 @.@ 013 . He was joined on the front row by teammate Hill , who was two @-@ tenths of a second behind . Schumacher was third in the Benetton , edging closer to the Williams drivers throughout both days of qualifying by steadily reducing the downforce on his car . His last run , right at the end of the second session , pressured Coulthard into leaving the pits to cover the German . The pole position man thus used an additional set of slick tyres , meaning that out of the allocation of seven sets of slick tyres as set out by the FIA , he had only two sets of brand @-@ new rubber for the race , whereas Schumacher had the advantage of three sets of new rubber . Hill , concerned about starting from the dirty side of the track ( the side of the track that is opposite to the racing line ) , had only two sets of brand new tyres for the race . 
 Berger took fourth despite going off into the gravel late in the second part of qualifying . Berger 's teammate Alesi was fifth , with Irvine completing the top six for his best qualifying position of the season . Rookie Magnussen qualified 12th , only two places behind teammate Blundell , after not making a mistake in either of the two sessions . Returning drivers Suzuki , Katayama , Morbidelli and Gachot qualified 13th , 17th , 19th and 24th respectively , with the grid covered by 7 @.@ 392 seconds . 
 = = = Race = = = 
 The conditions for the race were dry with the air temperature 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) . The drivers took to the track at 09 : 30 JST ( GMT + 9 ) for a 30 @-@ minute warm @-@ up session . Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying ; Coulthard had the fastest time of 1 : 16 @.@ 831 . Hill was third in the other Williams car ; Boullion split them in the Sauber for second position . Olivier Panis completed the top four in a Ligier car , eight @-@ tenths of a second behind Hill . Hill drove the spare Williams car along the inside of the start – finish straight in an effort to clean up his grid position on the dusty side of the track . Schumacher finished the session in eighth , despite going off the track , damaging his race car in the process . The remote and inaccessible nature of the circuit and the fact that the Japanese Grand Prix took place just one week later resulted in a meagre race @-@ day crowd of only 15 @,@ 000 spectators . 
 The race started at 14 : 00 JST . Coulthard , from pole position on the grid , held onto the lead into the first corner . Hill , who started alongside Coulthard , had a bad start . Schumacher attempted to go around the outside of Hill at the first corner , but Hill held Schumacher off . Both drivers ran off the racing line in the process , allowing Alesi through into second place . At the end of lap one , Coulthard led Alesi by 2 @.@ 8 seconds , with Hill a further three @-@ tenths back . Berger was fourth , with Schumacher demoted to fifth . Bertrand Gachot in the Pacific became the first person to retire from the race with a gearbox problem on lap two . He was followed by Suzuki and Boullion , who both spun off the track and were unable to continue . Boullion blamed his spin on Minardi driver Pedro Lamy , whom he accused of weaving in front of him . Schumacher passed Berger for fourth position on lap five , and immediately began closing on Hill in third , who himself was only a few tenths behind Alesi . Schumacher attempted to pass Hill on lap 11 for third place at the hairpin , but Hill held him off . As Hill and Schumacher were held up by the slower Ferraris , Coulthard pulled away by more than a second a lap in the first eight laps . By lap 18 , Coulthard 's gap to second place was 14 seconds , and it appeared that he would win the race comfortably . 
 Alesi , Hill and Schumacher all pitted for their first of three stops on lap 18 . The Benetton pitcrew made a quick stop for Schumacher , allowing him to get out ahead of Alesi and Hill . Hill lost additional time with a sticking refuelling valve , causing his stop to last almost twice as long as Schumacher 's . Schumacher exited the pit stop in fourth place ( behind Coulthard , and the yet @-@ to @-@ stop Berger and Herbert ) , with Alesi in seventh place ( split from Schumacher by Irvine ) and Hill in tenth place ( separated from Alesi by Frentzen and Blundell ) . With Alesi and Hill held up by the slower runners on two @-@ stop strategies in front , Schumacher pulled away and closed in on Coulthard . Blundell pitted on the next lap , and Hill passed Frentzen on lap 22 . On the following lap , Alesi passed Irvine at the hairpin ; Hill tried to follow Alesi through but his front wing hit the rear of Irvine 's car , causing minor damage . Irvine pitted at the end of lap 25 , allowing Hill to resume his chase of Alesi unimpeded . Like his teammate , Coulthard was scheduled to make three stops , but his pit strategy was changed to make only two by staying out six laps longer than originally scheduled , and then taking onboard more fuel than first planned at his first stop on lap 24 . As a result of a lighter fuel load for Schumacher because of the different strategies , Schumacher began to consistently lap faster than the Scotsman . 
 Schumacher made his second stop on lap 38 , and came out of the pits just in front of third @-@ placed Alesi , but over twenty seconds behind Coulthard . Schumacher immediately began setting fastest laps and began to close in on Coulthard once more . Hill managed to move up to third , in front of Alesi , during their second pit stops on laps 38 and 39 respectively . The Ferrari of Alesi then dropped further back as teammate Berger passed him at the hairpin for fourth position on lap 45 . Coulthard made his second and final stop for new tyres on lap 49 ; exiting 14 seconds behind Schumacher , who continued to extend the margin between the two . Coulthard was unable to capitalise on the performance advantage offered by the new tyres after the stop due to lapped traffic getting in his way . The German made his third and final pit stop on lap 60 with a 21 second advantage , exiting in front of Coulthard to lead the race . Schumacher opened the gap to 15 seconds , and won the race after 83 laps to secure his eighth victory of the season in a time of 1 : 48 : <unk> Schumacher was crowned the 1995 Drivers ' Champion as Hill could not catch his points total with two races remaining . He also became the youngest double Drivers ' Champion in Formula One history . Coulthard finished second in his Williams , 14 seconds behind Schumacher , with teammate Hill third . The Ferraris of Berger and Alesi were fourth and fifth respectively , but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages . Berger suffered from a misfiring engine throughout the race . Herbert took the final point in sixth place for Benetton , ahead of Frentzen , Panis and Blundell . Throughout the race , Barrichello and Magnussen engaged in a battle for tenth and eleventh positions , with Magnussen keeping Barrichello behind until lap 37 when the Brazilian managed to overtake him into the hairpin . Magnussen finished in tenth place , but Barrichello subsequently retired on lap 67 with an engine problem . Magnussen 's first race was described as " highly accomplished " by the year 's Autocourse annual . After his impressive qualifying performance , Irvine was heading for eighth place , but made an unscheduled pit stop on lap 72 and dropped to eleventh . The attrition rate was low , with 17 of the 24 starters finishing the race . 
 = = = Post @-@ race = = = 
 After the race , it was revealed that Schumacher endured a downshift problem after his final stop , and that he was lucky to complete the final lap as warning lights had activated on his steering wheel . Schumacher praised his pitcrew for doing a " perfect " first stop which helped him move in front of Alesi and Hill . He said he " never saw anything like this team and its ability to come up with strategies " and that they never made " one mistake this season " . Off @-@ camera while going through parc fermé , Schumacher and Hill renewed their argument from the Belgian Grand Prix over what degree of blocking was acceptable after their first corner incident . Schumacher told Hill that he was unhappy with Hill 's driving throughout the race , most notably during Schumacher 's overtaking attempts on lap one and lap eleven where Schumacher felt Hill had " brake tested " him . Hill refuted Schumacher 's claims , saying : 
 Michael wasn 't happy with what I did a couple of times in the race and he has told me that he is unhappy with my driving . I find that extraordinary . The situation now is that we are completely free to drive as we like as long as it is not deliberately dangerous , So I drove in that style and he didn 't like it . He should have no complaints ... somehow or other , when we got into the braking area at the end of the back straight I did something wrong . But I can 't see what I did wrong . It seems that there is one rule for him and another for everybody else at times . I just think that either you agree to that , and there should be no complaints , or there are rules and you should stick to them . I think that I am a better , stronger driver this year than I was last year and can build on that for next year . Clearly Michael has an advantage over everyone and if I want to win , then I am going to have to overhaul him . 
 Despite Hill 's comments , he endured continued criticism by the British media after the poor performance ; speculation brewed that Williams were going to replace him with Frentzen for the 1996 season . Despite the rumours , Williams team boss Frank Williams gave Hill " an unequivocal vote of confidence " heading into the next race , the Japanese Grand Prix . Schumacher subsequently changed his opinion of the incident after watching video footage prior to the Japanese race and no longer blamed Hill for it . 
 During an interview Coulthard , who finished second , revealed that it was his decision to change to a two @-@ stop strategy from a three @-@ stop strategy , telling the Williams pitcrew to delay his stop . Afterwards , he said that in hindsight he would have stayed on a three @-@ stop strategy , and wished he could " blame someone else for this decision , but I can 't " . The 1995 race was the last held at the Aida circuit , and the last Formula One race to date held under the Pacific Grand Prix banner , with the manager of the TI Circuit unable to keep the venue financially profitable .

 Laura Lane Welch Bush ( born November 4 , 1946 ) is the wife of the 43rd President of the United States , George W. Bush , and was the First Lady from 2001 to 2009 . 
 Bush graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1968 with a Bachelor 's Degree in Education , and took a job as a second grade teacher . After attaining her Master 's Degree in Library Science at the University of Texas at Austin , she was employed as a librarian . Bush is an avid proponent of the Dewey Decimal System . 
 Bush met her future husband , George W. Bush , in 1977 , and they were married later that year . The couple had twin daughters in 1981 . Bush 's political involvement began during her marriage . She campaigned with her husband during his unsuccessful 1978 run for the United States Congress , and later for his successful Texas gubernatorial campaign . 
 As First Lady of Texas , Bush implemented many initiatives focused on health , education , and literacy . In 1999 , she aided her husband in campaigning for the presidency in a number of ways , most notably delivering a keynote address at the 2000 Republican National Convention , which gained her national attention . She became First Lady after her husband defeated Democrat Al Gore in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election . 
 Polled by The Gallup Organization as one of the most popular First Ladies , Bush was involved in national and global concerns during her tenure . She continued to advance her trademark interests of education and literacy by establishing the semi @-@ annual National Book Festival in 2001 , and encouraged education on a worldwide scale . She also advanced women 's causes through The Heart Truth and Susan G. Komen for the Cure organizations . She represented the United States during her foreign trips , which tended to focus on HIV / AIDS and malaria awareness . 
 Bush 's memoir , Spoken from the Heart , was published in 2010 . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Laura Lane Welch was born on November 4 , 1946 in Midland , Texas , the only child of Harold Welch ( 1912 – 1995 ) and Jenna Louise Hawkins Welch ( born 1919 ) . 
 Bush is of English , French , and Swiss ancestry . Her father was a home builder and later successful real estate developer , while her mother worked as the bookkeeper for her father 's business . Early on , her parents encouraged her to read , leading to what would become her love of reading . She said , " I learned [ how important reading is ] at home from my mother . When I was a little girl , my mother would read stories to me . I have loved books and going to the library ever since . In the summer , I liked to spend afternoons reading in the library . I enjoyed the Little House on the Prairie and Little Women books , and many others ... Reading gives you enjoyment throughout your life . " Bush has also credited her second grade teacher , Charlene <unk> , for inspiring her interest in education . 
 On the night of November 6 , 1963 , Laura Welch ran a stop sign and struck another car , resulting in the death of its driver . The victim was her close friend and classmate Michael Dutton Douglas . By some accounts , Douglas had been Welch 's boyfriend at one time . Welch and her passenger , both 17 , were treated for minor injuries . According to the accident report released by the city of Midland in 2000 , in response to an open @-@ records request , she was not charged in the incident . Bush 's spokesman said , " It was a very tragic accident that deeply affected the families and was very painful for all involved , including the community at large . " In her book Spoken from the Heart , she says that the accident caused her to lose her faith " for many , many years " . 
 She attended James Bowie Elementary School , San Jacinto Junior High School , and Robert E. Lee High School in Midland .

 She met George W. Bush in July 1977 when mutual friends Joe and Jan O 'Neill invited her and Bush to a backyard barbecue at their home . He proposed to her at the end of September and they were married on November 5 of that year at the First United Methodist Church in Midland , the same church in which she had been baptized . Laura bought a tan , two @-@ toned dress off the rack for the wedding . The couple honeymooned in Cozumel , Mexico . George W. Bush detailed his choice to marry Laura as the " best decision of my life . " Laura , an only child , said she gained " brothers and sisters and wonderful in @-@ laws " who all accepted her after she wed George W. Bush . 
 The year after their marriage , the couple began campaigning for George W. Bush 's 1978 Congressional candidacy . According to George Bush , when he asked her to marry him , she had said , " Yes . But only if you promise me that I 'll never have to make a campaign speech . " She soon relented , and gave her first stump speech for him in 1978 on the courthouse steps in Muleshoe , Texas . After narrowly winning the primary , he lost the general election . 
 Bush attended the inauguration of father @-@ in @-@ law George H. W. Bush as Vice President in January 1981 , after he and his running mate Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election . She attributed her father @-@ in @-@ law 's electing to the vice presidency with giving her and her husband national exposure . 
 The Bushes had tried to conceive for three years , but pregnancy did not happen easily . On November 25 , 1981 , Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters , Barbara and Jenna . The twins were born five weeks early by an emergency Caesarean section , as Laura had developed life @-@ threatening pre @-@ eclampsia ( toxemia ) . The twins graduated from high school in 2000 and attended Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin , respectively , in 2004 . To date , Bush is the only First Lady to have given birth to twins . 
 George W. Bush credited his wife with his decision to stop drinking in 1986 . She reflected that she thought her husband " was drinking too much " amid her knowing it was not his desired way of living . Approaching him , she related that her father had been alcoholic and it was not a pattern she wished to repeat in their family . She is also credited with having a stabilizing effect on his private life . According to People magazine reporter Jane Simms Podesta , " She is the steel in his back . She is a civilizing influence on him . I think she built him , in many ways , into the person he is today . " 
 Bush traveled to Kuwait in April 1993 , accompanying her father @-@ in @-@ law and mother @-@ in @-@ law as well as brothers @-@ in @-@ law Jeb and Marvin Bush after former President Bush was invited to return to the Middle East for the first time since his presidency . 
 Several times a year , Bush and her husband travel to their sprawling family estate , the Bush compound , better known as Walker 's Point . Located in Kennebunkport , Maine , the compound is where Bush family gatherings have been held for nearly 100 years . 
 = = First Lady of Texas = = 
 Bush became the First Lady of Texas when her husband was elected as the Governor of Texas and served as first lady of that state from January 17 , 1995 , to December 21 , 2000 . When asked about her interest in politics , she responded , " It doesn 't drive me . " 
 Though during her years in the Governor 's Mansion , she did not hold a single formal event , Laura worked for women 's and children 's causes including health , education , and literacy . She implemented four major initiatives : Take Time For Kids , an awareness campaign to educate parents and caregivers on parenting ; family literacy , through cooperation with the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy , she urged Texas communities to establish family literacy programs ; Reach Out and Read , a pediatric reading program ; and Ready to Read , an early childhood educational program . 
 She raised money for public libraries through her establishment of the Texas Book Festival , and established the First Lady 's Family Literacy Initiative , which encouraged families to read together . Bush further established " Rainbow Rooms " across the state , in an effort to provide emergency services for neglected or abused children . Through this , she promoted the Adopt @-@ a @-@ <unk> Program to provide support for Child Protective Services . She used her position to advocate Alzheimer 's disease and breast cancer awareness as well . 
 Her husband announced his campaign for President of the United States in mid @-@ 1999 , something that she agreed to . She did say , however , that she had never dreamed that he would run for office . The Bush campaign worked to assure voters that as First Lady , she would not seek to emulate then @-@ First Lady Hillary Clinton . When asked who she would be like out of the past First Ladies , she insisted it would be herself . In July , she delivered a keynote address to the delegates at the 2000 Republican National Convention , which put her on the national stage . In December 2000 , her husband resigned as Governor of Texas to prepare for his inauguration as President of the United States in January 2001 .

 As First Lady , Bush was involved in issues of concern to children and women , both nationally and internationally . Her major initiatives included education and women 's health . 
 = = = Education and children = = = 
 Early into the administration , Bush made it known that she would focus much of her attention on education . This included recruiting highly qualified teachers to ensure that young children would be taught well . She also focused on early child development . In 2001 , to promote reading and education , she partnered with the Library of Congress to launch the annual National Book Festival . In January 2002 , Bush testified before the Senate Committee on Education , asking for higher teachers ' salaries and better training for Head Start programs . She is also credited with creating a national initiative called " Ready to Read , Ready to Learn " , which promotes reading at a young age . To promote American patriotic heritage in schools , she helped launch the National Anthem Project . In 2006 , Bush and media executives worked together to provide a $ 500 @,@ 000 grant for school libraries along the Gulf Coast which had been devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita . 
 Immediately following the September 11 , 2001 attacks , Bush spoke regarding America 's children : 
 [ W ] e need to reassure our children that they are safe in their homes and schools . We need to reassure them that many people love them and care for them , and that while there are some bad people in the world , there are many more good people . 
 The following day , she composed open letters to America 's families , focusing on elementary and middle school students , which she distributed through state education officials . She took an interest in mitigating the emotional effects of the attacks on children , particularly the disturbing images repeatedly replayed on television . On the one @-@ year anniversary , she encouraged parents to instead read to their children , and perhaps light a candle in memoriam , saying , " Don 't let your children see the images , especially on September 11 , when you know it 'll probably be on television again and again – the plane hitting the building or the buildings falling . " 
 Later in her tenure , she was honored by the United Nations , as the body named her honorary ambassador for the United Nations ' Decade of Literacy . In this position , she announced that she would host a Conference on Global Literacy . The conference , held in September 2006 , encouraged a constant effort to promote literacy and highlighted many successful literacy programs . She coordinated this as a result of her many trips abroad where she witnessed how literacy benefited children in poorer nations . 
 Bush co @-@ authored a children 's book with her daughter , Jenna , called Read All About It ! . It was published on April 23 , 2008 . 
 On July 28 , 2008 she had visited Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site in Flat Rock , North Carolina where she met with superintendent Connie Backlund and the Friends of Carl Sandburg Home 's President Linda Holt as well as various students from Boys and Girls Club of Henderson County , North Carolina . 
 On October 3 , 2008 she visited Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Home and Museum where she praised her works such as Farmer Boy , These Happy Golden Years and The Little House on the Prairie , the last of which she had felt an association with as a child . During the same Laura Ingalls Wilder 's estate visit , she said that she read her books to her daughters and gave the writer Save America 's Treasures grant . 
 = = = September 11 attacks = = = 
 On September 11 , 2001 , Bush hosted her father and mother @-@ in @-@ law George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush and was intended to give a testimony to Congress on education . Instead , during the September 11 attacks , Bush was taken to inside the White House and placed in an underground bunker , later being met by her husband , who had returned to Washington from Florida . Two weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks , Bush inaugurated a music concert at the Kennedy Center , organized to fundraise for families of the victims . Though she received applause , she returned the compliment to members of the audience and added that although the event was tragic , Americans had deepened their appreciation " of life itself , how fragile it can be , what a gift it is and how much we need each other . " Senator Ted Kennedy , who introduced Bush at the event , praised her and said he knew his deceased sibling , the late President John F. Kennedy , would also be proud of her . Bush believes the September 11 attacks ignited the interest in the way Afghanistan women were treated , who were not allowed to leave their homes and of which composed a high number of widows due to terrorist attacks in Afghanistan prior to the attacks . 
 = = = Women 's health and rights = = = 
 Another of her signature issues were those relating to the health and well being of women . She established the Women 's Health and Wellness Initiative and became involved with two major campaigns . 
 Bush first became involved with The Heart Truth awareness campaign in 2003 . It is an organization established by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute to raise awareness about heart disease in women , and how to prevent the condition . She serves in the honorary position of ambassador for the program leading the federal government 's effort to give women a " wake up call " about the risk of heart disease . She commented on the disease : " Like many women , I assumed heart disease was a man 's disease and cancer was what we would fear the most . Yet heart disease kills more women in our country than all forms of cancer combined . When it comes to heart disease , education , prevention , and even a little red dress can save lives . " She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live , or had lived , with the condition . This outreach was credited with saving the life of one woman who went to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack . 
 With her predecessor , former First Lady Nancy Reagan , Bush dedicated the First Ladies Red Dress Collection at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in May 2005 . It is an exhibit containing red suits worn by former First Ladies Lady Bird Johnson , Betty Ford , Rosalynn Carter , Nancy Reagan , Barbara Bush , Hillary Rodham Clinton , and Laura Bush meant to raise awareness by highlighting America 's first ladies . She has participated in fashion shows displaying red dresses worn on celebrities as well . 
 Bush 's mother , Jenna Welch , was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 78 . She endured surgery and currently has no further signs of cancer . Laura Bush has become a breast cancer activist on her mother 's behalf through her involvement in the Susan G. Komen for the Cure . She applauded the foundation 's efforts in eliminating cancer and said , " A few short years ago , a diagnosis of breast cancer left little hope of recovery . But thanks to the work of the Komen Foundation ... more women and men are beating breast cancer and beating the odds . " She used her position to gain international support for the foundation through the Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research of the Americas , an initiative that unites experts from the United States , Brazil , Costa Rica and Mexico . 
 In November 2001 , she became the first person other than a president to deliver the weekly presidential radio address . She used the opportunity to discuss the plight of women in Afghanistan leading up to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan , saying , " The brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists . " Her husband was originally to give the address but he felt that she should do it ; she later recalled , " At that moment , it was not that I found my voice . Instead , it was as if my voice found me . " Her words summarized one of the goals and moral rationales of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and it became one of the more famous speeches of his administration . In May 2002 , she made a speech to the people of Afghanistan through Radio Liberty . In March 2005 , she made the first of three trips to that country as First Lady . 
 = = = Campaigning = = = 
 Bush campaigned for Republicans around the country in 2002 for that year 's midterm elections , attending and hosting fundraisers as well as giving speeches that were deemed as the Bush administration " working against women 's rights issues and using women to do their dirty work " and partly a test for Bush on how well she could campaign for her husband in the impending two years when he sought re @-@ election . While campaigning for her husband 's re @-@ election in 2004 , she cited the campaign as their last , though this would later be disputed when she campaigned for Republicans across the country in the 2006 midterm elections . She was credited with having raised $ 15 million for his campaign as well as the Republican Party while still succeeding in keeping a separate schedule that allowed for her to tend to the traditional duties she had as First Lady . 
 Bush was a participant in the 2006 midterm elections , beginning her campaigning in April . Though her poll numbers had decreased from an 80 % approval rating , they still superseded that of President Bush , whose approval rating was only praised by a third of Americans . Ed Henry of CNN noted Bush 's popularity , writing , " The first lady is treated like a rock star on the campaign trail -- with local Republicans lining up for photographs and autographs -- as she criss @-@ crosses the country to help candidates . " Bush relied on a strategy of praising the Republican candidate for their achievements and attending events alongside them . In September 2008 , Bush appeared and spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention , where she introduced her husband . 
 = = = Popularity and style = = = 
 Laura Bush 's approval ratings have consistently ranked very high . In January 2006 , a USA Today / CBS / Gallup poll recorded her approval rating at 82 percent and disapproval at 13 percent . That places Bush as one of the most popular first ladies . Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said , " She is more popular , and more welcome , in many parts of the country than the president ... In races where the moderates are in the most trouble , Laura Bush is the one who can do the most good . " 
 Sady Doyle reasoned that Bush was hard to dislike due to her adopting " the least partisan causes " such as literacy and breast cancer , which would attract the support of most Americans and her coming off as a " mild , polite , ordinary woman who might go to church with your mother , or organize suburban potlucks . " Doyle furthered that her statements were never enough to offend others and the harshest criticism that could be bestowed upon her was that she was boring . 
 She disagreed with Fox News ' Chris Wallace in 2006 when Wallace asked why the American people were beginning to lose confidence in President Bush , saying , " Well , I don 't think they are . And I don 't really believe those polls . I travel around the country , I see people , I see their response to my husband , I see their response to me . There are a lot of difficult challenges right now in the United States ... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard . They 're hard decisions to make . And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are . But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States , that he 's doing what he – especially in the war on terror , what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States , and that is to protect them ... When his polls were really high they weren 't on the front page . " 
 During the January 2005 second inauguration ceremonies for her husband , Laura Bush was looked highly upon by People magazine , The Washington Post , and others for her elegance and fashion sense . At the inauguration she wore a winter white cashmere dress and matching coat designed by Oscar de la Renta . Following the inauguration were the inaugural galas , to which Bush wore a pale , aqua lace gown , sprinkled with crystals , with long sleeves in a silver blue mist . The tulle gown was also designed for her by de la Renta . According to The Washington Post , " [ I ] t made her look radiant and glamorous . " 
 = = = Foreign trips = = = 
 During her husband 's second term , Bush was more involved in foreign matters . She traveled to numerous countries as a representative of the United States . 
 As First Lady , she took five goodwill trips to Africa . The purpose of these has mostly been to raise awareness about HIV / AIDS and malaria , but Bush has also stressed the need for education and greater opportunities for women . She has taken many other trips to other countries to promote and gain support for President Bush 's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief ; these countries include Zambia ( 2007 ) , Mozambique ( 2007 ) , Mali ( 2007 ) , Senegal ( 2007 ) , and Haiti ( 2008 ) . 
 In mid @-@ 2007 , she took a trip to Burma where she spoke out in support of the pro @-@ democracy movement , and urged Burmese soldiers and militias to refrain from violence . Later that October , she ventured to the Middle East . Bush said she was in the region in an attempt to improve America 's image by highlighting concern for women 's health , specifically promoting her breast cancer awareness work with the US @-@ Middle East Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research . She defined the trip as successful , saying that stereotypes were broken on both sides . 
 Overall , Bush traveled to 77 countries in the eight years of her husband 's presidency , touring 67 of those during the second term . 
 = = = Views on policy = = = 
 Bush is a Republican and has identified herself with the GOP since her marriage . 
 When asked about abortion in 2000 , Bush said she did not believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned . She did not comment on whether women had the right to an abortion . She did say , however , that the country should do " what we can to limit the number of abortions , to try to reduce the number of abortions in a lot of ways , and that is , by talking about responsibility with girls and boys , by teaching abstinence , having abstinence classes everywhere in schools and in churches and in Sunday school " . 
 Bush responded to a question during a 2006 interview concerning the Federal Marriage Amendment by calling for elected leaders not to politicize same @-@ sex marriage , " I don 't think it should be used as a campaign tool , obviously . It requires a lot of sensitivity to just talk about the issue ... a lot of sensitivity . " 
 On July 12 , 2005 , while in South Africa , Bush suggested her husband replace retiring Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O 'Connor with another woman . On October 2 , during a private dinner at the White House with his wife , President Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O 'Connor . Later that month , after Miers had faced intense criticism , Laura Bush questioned whether the charges were sexist in nature . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 In late October 2008 , days before that year 's Presidential election , Bush hosted a three @-@ hour session with staffers and historians discussing how she would like to be remembered , leading to this meeting being termed the " legacy lunch . " According to historian Myra <unk> , this was the first time in history that a First Lady had ever directly reached out to historians to talk about her accomplishments . Attendants of the meeting said that Bush wanted to change the perception that she was a traditional First Lady in that she always stayed by her husband 's side . Bush 's chief of staff Anita McBride called this characterization of Bush " unfair " and though conceding that she was traditional , McBride noted Bush broke from tradition in addressing issues that were not customary . 
 In April 2009 , three months after the Bushes left office , Martha Gore wrote an op @-@ ed piece titled , " Laura Bush : A First Lady who made America proud , " where she positively assessed Bush 's role as First Lady and expressed Bush 's successes were rooted in the dignity she brought to the office despite her reserved style as well as her making a good role model for young women and representing American womanhood at its finest . Gore concluded , " Now that Ms. Bush has returned to private life , she will continue to be remembered as a First Lady who did America proud . " A 2014 poll which asked who was the most popular First Lady in the past 25 years found Bush ranked in fourth place , behind Hillary Clinton , mother @-@ in @-@ law Barbara and direct successor Michelle Obama .

However , Fox News revealed the trip the following morning . 
 In May 2010 , Bush released her memoir , Spoken from the Heart , in conjunction with a national tour . 
 On May 11 , 2010 , during an interview on Larry King Live , Bush was asked about same @-@ sex marriage . She said she views it as a generational issue and said she believes it will be made legal in the future . Bush offered support for the issue by saying , " ... when couples are committed to each other and love each other ... they ought to have the same sort of rights that everyone has . " Bush referred to her 2000 interview , reaffirming her support for Roe v. Wade , " I think it 's important that [ abortion ] remain legal . Because I think it 's important for people – that for medical reasons and , and other reasons . " On February 22 , 2013 , without her consent , she was included in a pro @-@ gay advertisement from the Respect of Marriage Coalition . A statement from Bush 's spokesperson states that Bush " did not approve of her inclusion in this advertisement nor is she associated with the group that made the ad in any way . When she became aware of the advertisement last night , we requested that the group remove her from it . " 
 On July 25 , 2012 she spoke at the Luisa <unk> 's estate where she praised Edith Wharton 's works , in particular Ethan Frome on her 150th anniversary . She also said that prior to this speech she also visited houses of Mark Twain at his 166th anniversary on November 29 , 2001 and was a guest of the show Mark Twain Tonight . Ten years prior to the Luisa <unk> 's estate visit she also visited Louisa May Alcott 's Orchard House in Concord , Massachusetts at which she met with the National Trust for Historic Preservation 's President and listened to Concord @-@ Carlisle High School 's chorus . 
 Bush continued to remain involved and concerned over the state of women in Afghanistan , speaking out editorials and appearances during 2013 that the women and girls who had been helped could not be abandoned during and after the planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan . 
 In April 2013 , Bush was in attendance at a news conference , where she said the recently built George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum was not a monument for her husband but instead a representation of the White House and the struggles of America during his tenure . She also mentioned not having trouble donating clothes to the library , admitting that she probably would have never worn them again in the first place . That month it was announced that she would serve as a keynote speaker for the 2013 Global Business Travel Association Convention in August .

 Over the course of the Obama presidency , she has developed an alliance with Michelle Obama , her immediate successor as First Lady . Despite their political differences , Michelle Obama has called Laura Bush both her friend and a role model , crediting Bush with setting " a high bar " for her during her tenure as First Lady . Bush defended Obama during her husband 's campaign for president in 2008 , publicly coming to her defense when she received criticism for a remark she made about being proud of her country for the first time in her adulthood during the campaign . Obama sent Bush a note thanking her and after the election met with Bush at the White House in November 2008 , Bush giving Obama a tour of her and her family 's soon @-@ to @-@ be home . 
 In September 2009 , Bush openly praised President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama . She reasoned that President Obama was performing well in the presidency despite having multiple initiatives taking place and complimented the First Lady 's transformation of the White House into " a comfortable home for her family . " The following year , in September 2010 , Bush and Obama commemorated the ninth anniversary of the September 11 attacks by leading a ceremony from a mountaintop to national memorial park . The two both acted as keynote speakers and met with the families of the 40 victims of United Airlines Flight 93 plane crash . In their remarks , the two sang each other praises , Obama thanking Bush for her handling of the aftermath of September 11 attacks while Bush called her a " first lady who serves this country with such grace . " 
 In July 2013 , Bush and Obama appeared together in Africa at the First Ladies Summit . Their husbands were also present , leading White House staffer Ben Rhodes to refer to the joint appearance as proof of the support for Africa in the United States regardless of political party . In their remarks , both Bush and Obama stressed the importance of being role models . Nine months later , on April 18 , 2014 , Bush spoke to The Inquisitr regarding income inequality where she said next regarding Michelle Obama 's income : " I want to make sure that when she 's working she 's getting paid the same as men . I gotta say that First Ladies right now don 't [ get paid ] , even though that 's a tough job ! " In August 2014 , Bush and Obama appeared together at the Kennedy Center .

She also campaigned for vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan , telling a crowd in Detroit that he and Romney had " better answers " on the economy and foreign policy . 
 After the 2012 election , where Romney lost to President Obama , Bush was asked in March 2013 during an interview whether the GOP 's positions on social issues such as same @-@ sex marriage and abortion led to more than half of female voters voting for the President . Bush responded that some of the candidates had " frightened some candidates " , but at the same time expressed her liking of the Republican Party having room for difference of opinion and that within the party , " we have room for all " . 
 Throughout 2015 , Bush was active in the presidential campaign of brother @-@ in @-@ law Jeb Bush , hosting fundraisers and endorsing him .

" It was reported that she would be assisting the campaign 's fundraising in Florida in October , Bloomberg News commenting that Jeb Bush was " calling in help from perhaps the most popular member of his family . " According to Clay Johnson , a friend of the Bush family , she was reportedly surprised by Donald Trump 's becoming frontrunner over the course of the election cycle . In February 2016 , amid her brother @-@ in @-@ law 's campaign trailing Trump in South Carolina polls , Bush traveled there with her husband . Ultimately , Jeb Bush dropped out after South Carolina . The following month , Bush declined answering if she would vote for Trump , who was the frontrunner in the Republican primary , should he become the nominee and said the U.S. was going through a xenophobic period at the time of the election cycle .

 = Voting Rights Act of 1965 = 
 The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting . It was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson during the height of the Civil Rights Movement on August 6 , 1965 , and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections . Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution , the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country , especially in the South . According to the U.S. Department of Justice , the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country . 
 The Act contains numerous provisions that regulate election administration . The Act 's " general provisions " provide nationwide protections for voting rights . Section 2 is a general provision that prohibits every state and local government from imposing any voting law that results in discrimination against racial or language minorities . Other general provisions specifically outlaw literacy tests and similar devices that were historically used to disenfranchise racial minorities . 
 The Act also contains " special provisions " that apply to only certain jurisdictions . A core special provision is the Section 5 preclearance requirement , which prohibits certain jurisdictions from implementing any change affecting voting without receiving <unk> from the U.S. Attorney General or the U.S. District Court for D.C. that the change does not discriminate against protected minorities . Another special provision requires jurisdictions containing significant language minority populations to provide bilingual ballots and other election materials . 
 Section 5 and most other special provisions apply to jurisdictions encompassed by the " coverage formula " prescribed in Section 4 ( b ) . The coverage formula was originally designed to encompass jurisdictions that engaged in egregious voting discrimination in 1965 , and Congress updated the formula in 1970 and 1975 . In Shelby County v. Holder ( 2013 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the coverage formula as unconstitutional , reasoning that it was no longer responsive to current conditions . The Court did not strike down Section 5 , but without a coverage formula , Section 5 is unenforceable . 
 = = Background = = 
 As initially ratified , the United States Constitution granted each state complete discretion to determine voter qualifications for its residents . After the Civil War , the three Reconstruction Amendments were ratified and limited this discretion . The Thirteenth Amendment ( 1865 ) prohibits slavery ; the Fourteenth Amendment ( 1868 ) grants citizenship to anyone " born or naturalized in the United States " and guarantees every person due process and equal protection rights ; and the Fifteenth Amendment ( 1870 ) provides that " [ t ] he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude . " These Amendments also empower Congress to enforce their provisions through " appropriate legislation " . 
 To enforce the Reconstruction Amendments , Congress passed the Enforcement Acts in the 1870s . The Acts criminalized the obstruction of a citizen 's voting rights and provided for federal supervision of the electoral process , including voter registration . However , in 1875 the Supreme Court struck down parts of the legislation as unconstitutional in United States v. Cruikshank and United States v. Reese . After the Reconstruction Era ended in 1877 , enforcement of these laws became erratic , and in 1894 , Congress repealed most of their provisions . 
 Southern states generally sought to disenfranchise racial minorities during and after Reconstruction . From 1868 to 1888 , electoral fraud and violence throughout the South suppressed the African @-@ American vote . From 1888 to 1908 , Southern states legalized disenfranchisement by enacting Jim Crow laws ; they amended their constitutions and passed legislation to impose various voting restrictions , including literacy tests , poll taxes , property @-@ ownership requirements , moral character tests , requirements that voter registration applicants interpret particular documents , and grandfather clauses that allowed otherwise @-@ ineligible persons to vote if their grandfathers voted ( which excluded many African Americans whose grandfathers had been slaves or otherwise ineligible ) . During this period , the Supreme Court generally upheld efforts to discriminate against racial minorities . In Giles v. Harris ( 1903 ) , the Court held that irrespective of the Fifteenth Amendment , the judiciary did not have the remedial power to force states to register racial minorities to vote . 
 In the 1950s , the Civil Rights Movement increased pressure on the federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities . In 1957 , Congress passed the first voting @-@ rights legislation since Reconstruction : the Civil Rights Act of 1957 . This legislation authorized the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived , created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation , and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations . Further protections were enacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1960 , which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities . 
 Although these acts helped empower courts to remedy violations of federal voting rights , strict legal standards made it difficult for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation . For example , to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test , the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter @-@ registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites . This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state 's counties in a process that could last months . The Department 's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials , who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities , remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls , and resign so that voter registration ceased . Moreover , the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage . Thus , between 1957 and 1964 , the African @-@ American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits . 
 Congress responded to rampant discrimination against racial minorities in public accommodations and government services by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . The Act included some voting rights protections ; it required registrars to equally administer literacy tests in writing to each voter and to accept applications that contained minor errors , and it created a rebuttable presumption that persons with a sixth @-@ grade education were sufficiently literate to vote . However , despite lobbying from civil rights leaders , the Act did not prohibit most forms of voting discrimination . President Lyndon B. Johnson recognized this , and shortly after the 1964 elections in which Democrats gained overwhelming majorities in both chambers of Congress , he privately instructed Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to draft " the <unk> , toughest voting rights act that you can " . However , Johnson did not publicly push for the legislation at the time ; his advisers warned him of political costs for vigorously pursuing a voting rights bill so soon after Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , and Johnson was concerned that championing voting rights would endanger his Great Society reforms by angering Southern Democrats in Congress . 
 Following the 1964 elections , civil rights organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) pushed for federal action to protect the voting rights of racial minorities . Their efforts culminated in protests in Alabama , particularly in the city of Selma , where County Sheriff Jim Clark 's police force violently resisted African @-@ American voter registration efforts . Speaking about the voting rights push in Selma , James Forman of SNCC said : 
 Our strategy , as usual , was to force the U.S. government to intervene in case there were arrests — and if they did not intervene , that inaction would once again prove the government was not on our side and thus intensify the development of a mass consciousness among blacks . Our slogan for this drive was " One Man , One Vote . " 
 In January 1965 , Martin Luther King , Jr . , James Bevel , and other civil rights leaders organized several demonstrations in Selma that led to violent clashes with police . These marches received national media coverage and drew attention to the issue of voting rights . King and other demonstrators were arrested during a march on February 1 for violating an anti @-@ parade ordinance ; this inspired similar marches in the following days , causing hundreds more to be arrested . On February 4 , civil rights leader Malcolm X gave a militant speech in Selma in which he said that many African Americans did not support King 's nonviolent approach ; he later privately said that he wanted to frighten whites into supporting King . The next day , King was released and a letter he wrote addressing voting rights , " Letter From A Selma Jail " , appeared in The New York Times . With the nation paying increasing attention to Selma and voting rights , President Johnson reversed his decision to delay voting rights legislation , and on February 6 , he announced he would send a proposal to Congress . However , he did not reveal the proposal 's content or when it would come before Congress . 
 On February 18 in Marion , Alabama , state troopers violently broke up a nighttime voting @-@ rights march during which officer James <unk> Fowler shot and killed young African @-@ American protester Jimmie Lee Jackson , who was unarmed and protecting his mother . Spurred by this event , and at the initiation of Bevel , on March 7 SCLC and SNCC began the Selma to Montgomery marches in which Selma residents proceeded to march to Alabama 's capital , Montgomery , to highlight voting rights issues and present Governor George Wallace with their grievances . On the first march , demonstrators were stopped by state and county police on horseback at the Edmund Pettus Bridge near Selma . The police shot tear gas into the crowd and trampled protesters . Televised footage of the scene , which became known as " Bloody Sunday " , generated outrage across the country . 
 In the wake of the events in Selma , President Johnson , addressing a televised joint session of Congress on March 15 , called on legislators to enact expansive voting rights legislation . He concluded his speech with the words " we shall overcome " , a major theme of the Civil Rights Movement . The legislation that Johnson referred to was the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , which was introduced in Congress two days later while civil rights leaders , now under the protection of federal troops , led a march of 25 @,@ 000 people from Selma to Montgomery .

 The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was introduced in Congress on March 17 , 1965 as S. 1564 , and it was jointly sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield ( D @-@ MT ) and Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen ( R @-@ IL ) , both of whom had worked with Attorney General Katzenbach to draft the bill 's language . Although Democrats held two @-@ thirds of the seats in both chambers of Congress after the 1964 Senate elections , Johnson worried that Southern Democrats would filibuster the legislation , as they had opposed other civil rights efforts . He enlisted Dirksen to help gain Republican support . Dirksen did not originally intend to support voting rights legislation so soon after supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , but he expressed willingness to accept " revolutionary " legislation after learning about the police violence against marchers in Selma on Bloody Sunday . Given Dirksen 's key role in helping Katzenbach draft the legislation , it became known informally as the " <unk> " bill . After Mansfield and Dirksen introduced the bill , 64 additional Senators agreed to cosponsor it , with a total 46 Democratic and 20 Republican cosponsors . 
 The bill contained several special provisions that targeted certain state and local governments : a " coverage formula " that determined which jurisdictions were subject to the Act 's other special provisions ( " covered jurisdictions " ) ; a " preclearance " requirement that prohibited covered jurisdictions from implementing changes to their voting procedures without first receiving approval from the U.S. Attorney General or the U.S. District Court for D.C. that the changes were not discriminatory ; and the suspension of " tests or devices " , such as literacy tests , in covered jurisdictions . The bill also authorized the assignment of federal examiners to register voters , and of federal observers to monitor elections , to covered jurisdictions that were found to have engaged in egregious discrimination . The bill set these special provisions to expire after five years . 
 The scope of the coverage formula was a matter of contentious Congressional debate . The coverage formula reached a jurisdiction if : ( 1 ) the jurisdiction maintained a " test or device " on November 1 , 1964 , and ( 2 ) less than 50 % of the jurisdiction 's voting @-@ age residents either were registered to vote on November 1 , 1964 or cast a ballot in the November 1964 presidential election . This formula reached few jurisdictions outside the Deep South . To appease legislators who felt that the bill unfairly targeted Southern jurisdictions , the bill included a general prohibition on racial discrimination in voting that applied nationwide . The bill also included provisions allowing a covered jurisdiction to " bail out " of coverage by proving in federal court that it had not used a " test or device " for a discriminatory purpose or with a discriminatory effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request . Additionally , the bill included a " bail in " provision under which federal courts could subject discriminatory non @-@ covered jurisdictions to remedies contained in the special provisions . 
 The bill was first considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee , whose chair , Senator James Eastland ( D @-@ MS ) , opposed the legislation with several other Southern Senators on the committee . To prevent the bill from dying in committee , Mansfield proposed a motion to require the Judiciary Committee to report the bill out of committee by April 9 , which the Senate overwhelmingly passed by a vote of 67 to 13 . During the committee 's consideration of the bill , Senator Ted Kennedy ( D @-@ MA ) led an effort to amend the bill to prohibit poll taxes . Although the Twenty @-@ fourth Amendment — which banned the use of poll taxes in federal elections — was ratified a year earlier , Johnson 's administration and the bill 's sponsors did not include a provision in the voting rights bill banning poll taxes in state elections because they feared courts would strike down the legislation as unconstitutional . Additionally , by excluding poll taxes from the definition of " tests or devices " , the coverage formula did not reach Texas or Arkansas , mitigating opposition from those two states ' influential congressional delegations . Nonetheless , with the support of liberal committee members , Kennedy 's amendment to prohibit poll taxes passed by a 9 @-@ 4 vote . In response , Dirksen offered an amendment that exempted from the coverage formula any state that had at least 60 % of its eligible residents registered to vote or that had a voter turnout that surpassed the national average in the preceding presidential election . This amendment , which effectively exempted all states from coverage except Mississippi , passed during a committee meeting in which three liberal members were absent . Dirksen offered to drop the amendment if the poll tax ban were removed . Ultimately , the bill was reported out of committee on April 9 by a 12 @-@ 4 vote without a recommendation . 
 On April 22 , the full Senate started debating the bill . Dirksen spoke first on the bill 's behalf , saying that " legislation is needed if the unequivocal mandate of the 15th Amendment ... is to be enforced and made effective , and if the Declaration of Independence is to be made truly meaningful . " Senator Strom Thurmond ( R @-@ SC ) retorted that the bill would lead to " despotism and tyranny " , and Senator Sam Ervin ( D @-@ NC ) argued that the bill was unconstitutional because it deprived states of their right under Article I , Section 2 of the Constitution to establish voter qualifications and because the bill 's special provisions targeted only certain jurisdictions . On May 6 , Ervin offered an amendment to abolish the coverage formula 's automatic trigger and instead allow federal judges to appoint federal examiners to administer voter registration . This amendment overwhelmingly failed , with 42 Democrats and 22 Republicans voting against it . After lengthy debate , Ted Kennedy 's amendment to prohibit poll taxes also failed 49 @-@ 45 on May 11 . However , the Senate agreed to include a provision authorizing the Attorney General to sue any jurisdiction , covered or non @-@ covered , to challenge its use of poll taxes . An amendment offered by Senator Robert Kennedy ( D @-@ NY ) to enfranchise English @-@ illiterate citizens who had attained at least a sixth @-@ grade education in a non @-@ English @-@ speaking school also passed by 48 @-@ 19 . Southern legislators offered a series of amendments to weaken the bill , all of which failed . 
 On May 25 , the Senate voted for cloture by a 70 @-@ 30 vote , thus overcoming the threat of filibuster and limiting further debate on the bill . On May 26 , the Senate passed the bill by a 77 @-@ 19 vote ( Democrats 47 @-@ 16 , Republicans 30 @-@ 2 ) ; only Senators representing Southern states voted against it . 
 = = = = House of Representatives = = = = 
 Emanuel Celler ( D @-@ NY ) , Chair of the House Judiciary Committee , introduced the Voting Rights Act in the House of Representatives on March 19 , 1965 as H.R. 6400 . The House Judiciary Committee was the first committee to consider the bill . The committee 's ranking Republican , William McCulloch ( R @-@ OH ) , generally supported expanding voting rights , but he opposed both the poll tax ban and the coverage formula , and he led opposition to the bill in committee . The committee eventually approved the bill on May 12 , but it did not file its committee report until June 1 . The bill included two amendments from subcommittee : a penalty for private persons who interfered with the right to vote , and a prohibition of all poll taxes . The poll tax prohibition gained Speaker of the House John McCormack 's support . The bill was next considered by the Rules Committee , whose chair , Howard W. Smith ( D @-@ VA ) , opposed the bill and delayed its consideration until June 24 , when Celler initiated proceedings to have the bill discharged from committee . Under pressure from the bill 's proponents , Smith allowed the bill to be released a week later , and the full House started debating the bill on July 6 . 
 To defeat the Voting Rights Act , McCulloch introduced an alternative bill , H.R. 7896 . It would have allowed the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction , and it would have imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth @-@ grade education . McCulloch 's bill was co @-@ sponsored by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford ( R @-@ MI ) and supported by Southern Democrats as an alternative to the Voting Rights Act . The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the Voting Rights Act . However , support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck ( D @-@ VA ) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the Voting Rights Act would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote . His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896 , and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171 @-@ 248 vote on July 9 . Later that night , the House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333 @-@ 85 vote ( Democrats 221 @-@ 61 , Republicans 112 @-@ 24 ) . 
 = = = = Conference committee = = = = 
 The chambers appointed a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill . A major contention concerned the poll tax provisions ; the Senate version allowed the Attorney General to sue states that used poll taxes to discriminate , while the House version outright banned all poll taxes . Initially , the committee members were stalemated . To help broker a compromise , Attorney General Katzenbach drafted legislative language explicitly asserting that poll taxes were unconstitutional and instructed the Department of Justice to sue the states that maintained poll taxes . To assuage concerns of liberal committee members that this provision was not strong enough , Katzenbach enlisted the help of Martin Luther King , Jr . , who gave his support to the compromise . King 's endorsement ended the stalemate , and on July 29 , the conference committee reported its version out of committee . The House approved this conference report version of the bill on August 3 by a 328 @-@ 74 vote ( Democrats 217 @-@ 54 , Republicans 111 @-@ 20 ) , and the Senate passed it on August 4 by a 79 @-@ 18 vote ( Democrats 49 @-@ 17 , Republicans 30 @-@ 1 ) . On August 6 , President Johnson signed the Act into law with King , Rosa Parks , John Lewis , and other civil rights leaders in attendance at the signing ceremony . 
 = = = Amendments = = = 
 Congress enacted major amendments to the Act in 1970 , 1975 , 1982 , 1992 , and 2006 . Each amendment coincided with an impending expiration of some or all of the Act 's special provisions . Originally set to expire by 1970 , Congress repeatedly reauthorized the special provisions in recognition of continuing voting discrimination . Congress extended the coverage formula and special provisions tied to it , such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement , for five years in 1970 , seven years in 1975 , and 25 years in both 1982 and 2006 . In 1970 and 1975 , Congress also expanded the reach of the coverage formula by supplementing it with new 1968 and 1972 trigger dates . Coverage was further enlarged in 1975 when Congress expanded the meaning of " tests or devices " to encompass any jurisdiction that provided English @-@ only election information , such as ballots , if the jurisdiction had a single language minority group that constituted more than five percent of the jurisdiction 's voting @-@ age citizens . These expansions brought numerous jurisdictions into coverage , including many outside of the South . To ease the burdens of the reauthorized special provisions , Congress liberalized the bailout procedure in 1982 by allowing jurisdictions to escape coverage by complying with the Act and affirmatively acting to expand minority political participation . 
 In addition to <unk> the original special provisions and expanding coverage , Congress amended and added several other provisions to the Act . For instance , Congress expanded the original ban on " tests or devices " to apply nationwide in 1970 , and in 1975 , Congress made the ban permanent . Separately , in 1975 Congress expanded the Act 's scope to protect language minorities from voting discrimination . Congress defined " language minority " to mean " persons who are American Indian , Asian American , Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage . " Congress amended various provisions , such as the preclearance requirement and Section 2 's general prohibition of discriminatory voting laws , to prohibit discrimination against language minorities . Congress also enacted a bilingual election requirement in Section 203 , which requires election officials in certain jurisdictions with large numbers of English @-@ illiterate language minorities to provide ballots and voting information in the language of the language minority group . Originally set to expire after 10 years , Congress reauthorized Section 203 in 1982 for seven years , expanded and reauthorized it in 1992 for 15 years , and reauthorized it in 2006 for 25 years . The bilingual election requirements have remained controversial , with proponents arguing that bilingual assistance is necessary to enable recently naturalized citizens to vote and opponents arguing that the bilingual election requirements constitute costly unfunded mandates . 
 Several of the amendments responded to judicial rulings with which Congress disagreed . In 1982 , Congress amended the Act to overturn the Supreme Court case Mobile v. Bolden ( 1980 ) , which held that the general prohibition of voting discrimination prescribed in Section 2 prohibited only purposeful discrimination . Congress responded by expanding Section 2 to explicitly ban any voting practice that had a discriminatory effect , regardless of whether the practice was enacted or operated for a discriminatory purpose . The creation of this " results test " shifted the majority of vote dilution litigation brought under the Act from preclearance lawsuits to Section 2 lawsuits . In 2006 , Congress amended the Act to overturn two Supreme Court cases : Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board ( 2000 ) , which interpreted the Section 5 preclearance requirement to prohibit only voting changes that were enacted or maintained for a " retrogressive " discriminatory purpose instead of any discriminatory purpose , and Georgia v. Ashcroft ( 2003 ) , which established a broader test for determining whether a redistricting plan had an impermissible effect under Section 5 than assessing only whether a minority group could elect its preferred candidates . In 2014 , the Voting Rights Amendments Act was introduced in Congress to create a new coverage formula and amend various other provisions in response to the Supreme Court case Shelby County v. Holder ( 2013 ) , which struck down the coverage formula as unconstitutional . It was referred to the Constitution and Civil Justice congressional subcommittee on February 11 , 2015 , but no action was taken on it that year . 
 = = Provisions = = 
 The Act contains two types of provisions : " general provisions " , which apply nationwide , and " special provisions " , which apply to only certain states and local governments . Most provisions are designed to protect the voting rights of racial and language minorities . The term " language minority " means " persons who are American Indian , Asian American , Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage . " The Act 's provisions have been colored by numerous judicial interpretations and Congressional amendments . 
 = = = General provisions = = = 
 = = = = General prohibition of discriminatory voting laws = = = = 
 Section 2 prohibits any jurisdiction from implementing a " voting qualification or prerequisite to voting , or standard , practice , or procedure ... in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right ... to vote on account of race , " color , or language minority status . The Supreme Court has allowed private plaintiffs to sue to enforce this prohibition . In Mobile v. Bolden ( 1980 ) , the Supreme Court held that as originally enacted in 1965 , Section 2 simply restated the Fifteenth Amendment and thus prohibited only those voting laws that were intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose . In 1982 , Congress amended Section 2 to create a " results " test , which prohibits any voting law that has a discriminatory effect irrespective of whether the law was intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose . The 1982 amendments provided that the results test does not guarantee protected minorities a right to proportional representation . 
 When determining whether a jurisdiction 's election law violates this general prohibition , courts have relied on factors enumerated in the Senate Judiciary Committee report associated with the 1982 amendments ( " Senate Factors " ) , including : 
 The history of official discrimination in the jurisdiction that affects the right to vote ; 
 The degree to which voting in the jurisdiction is racially polarized ; 
 The extent of the jurisdiction 's use of majority vote requirements , unusually large electoral districts , prohibitions on bullet voting , and other devices that tend to enhance the opportunity for voting discrimination ; 
 Whether minority candidates are denied access to the jurisdiction 's candidate slating processes , if any ; 
 The extent to which the jurisdiction 's minorities are discriminated against in socioeconomic areas , such as education , employment , and health ; 
 Whether overt or subtle racial appeals in campaigns exist ; 
 The extent to which minority candidates have won elections ; 
 The degree that elected officials are unresponsive to the concerns of the minority group ; and 
 Whether the policy justification for the challenged law is tenuous . 
 The report indicates not all or a majority of these factors need to exist for an electoral device to result in discrimination , and it also indicates that this list is not exhaustive , allowing courts to consider additional evidence at their discretion . 
 Section 2 prohibits two types of discrimination : " vote denial " , in which a person is denied the opportunity to cast a ballot or to have their vote properly counted , and " vote dilution " , in which the strength or effectiveness of a person 's vote is diminished . Most Section 2 litigation has concerned vote dilution , especially claims that a jurisdiction 's redistricting plan or use of at @-@ large / multimember elections prevents minority voters from casting sufficient votes to elect their preferred candidates . An at @-@ large election can dilute the votes cast by minority voters by allowing a cohesive majority group to win every legislative seat in the jurisdiction . Redistricting plans can be gerrymandered to dilute votes cast by minorities by " packing " high numbers of minority voters into a small number of districts or " cracking " minority groups by placing small numbers of minority voters into a large number of districts . 
 In Thornburg v. Gingles ( 1986 ) , the Supreme Court used the term " vote dilution through submergence " to describe claims that a jurisdiction 's use of an at @-@ large / multimember election system or gerrymandered redistricting plan diluted minority votes , and it established a legal framework for assessing such claims under Section 2 . Under the Gingles test , plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions : 
 The racial or language minority group " is sufficiently numerous and compact to form a majority in a single @-@ member district " ; 
 The minority group is " politically cohesive " ( meaning its members tend to vote similarly ) ; and 
 The " majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it ... usually to defeat the minority 's preferred candidate . " 
 The first precondition is known as the " compactness " requirement and concerns whether a majority @-@ minority district can be created . The second and third preconditions are collectively known as the " racially polarized voting " or " racial bloc voting " requirement , and they concern whether the voting patterns of the different racial groups are different from each other . If a plaintiff proves these preconditions exist , then the plaintiff must additionally show , using the remaining Senate Factors and other evidence , that under the " totality of the circumstances " , the jurisdiction 's redistricting plan or use of at @-@ large or multimember elections diminishes the ability of the minority group to elect candidates of its choice . 
 Subsequent litigation further defined the contours of " vote dilution through submergence " claims . In Bartlett v. Strickland ( 2009 ) , the Supreme Court held that the first Gingles precondition can be satisfied only if a district can be drawn in which the minority group comprises a majority of voting @-@ age citizens . This means that plaintiffs cannot succeed on a submergence claim in jurisdictions where the size of the minority group , despite not being large enough to comprise a majority in a district , is large enough for its members to elect their preferred candidates with the help of " crossover " votes from some members of the majority group . In contrast , the Supreme Court has not addressed whether different protected minority groups can be aggregated to satisfy the Gingles preconditions as a coalition , and lower courts have split on the issue . 
 The Supreme Court provided additional guidance on the " totality of the circumstances " test in Johnson v. De Grandy ( 1994 ) . The Court emphasized that the existence of the three Gingles preconditions may be insufficient to prove liability for vote dilution through submergence if other factors weigh against such a determination , especially in lawsuits challenging redistricting plans . In particular , the Court held that even where the three Gingles preconditions are satisfied , a jurisdiction is unlikely to be liable for vote dilution if its redistricting plan contains a number of majority @-@ minority districts that is proportional to the minority group 's population . The decision thus clarified that Section 2 does not require jurisdictions to maximize the number of majority @-@ minority districts . The opinion also distinguished the proportionality of majority @-@ minority districts , which allows minorities to have a proportional opportunity to elect their candidates of choice , from the proportionality of election results , which Section 2 explicitly does not guarantee to minorities . 
 An issue regarding the third Gingles precondition remains unresolved . In Gingles , the Supreme Court split as to whether plaintiffs must prove that the majority racial group votes as a bloc specifically because its members are motivated to vote based on racial considerations and not other considerations that may overlap with race , such as party affiliation . A plurality of justices said that requiring such proof would violate Congress 's intent to make Section 2 a " results " test , but Justice White maintained that the proof was necessary to show that an electoral scheme results in racial discrimination . Since Gingles , lower courts have split on the issue . 
 Although most Section 2 litigation has involved claims of vote dilution through submergence , courts also have addressed other types of vote dilution under this provision . In Holder v. Hall ( 1994 ) , the Supreme Court held that claims that minority votes are diluted by the small size of a governing body , such as a one @-@ person county commission , may not be brought under Section 2 . A plurality of the Court reasoned that no uniform , non @-@ <unk> " benchmark " size for a governing body exists , making relief under Section 2 impossible . Another type of vote dilution may result from a jurisdiction 's requirement that a candidate be elected by a majority vote . A majority @-@ vote requirement may cause a minority group 's candidate of choice , who would have won the election with a simple plurality of votes , to lose after a majority of voters unite behind another candidate in a runoff election . The Supreme Court has not addressed whether such claims may be brought under Section 2 , and lower courts have reached different conclusions on the issue . 
 In addition to claims of vote dilution , courts have considered vote denial claims brought under Section 2 . The Supreme Court , in Richardson v. Ramirez ( 1974 ) , held that felony disenfranchisement laws cannot violate Section 2 because , among other reasons , Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment permits such laws . A federal district court in Mississippi held that a " dual registration " system that requires a person to register to vote separately for state elections and local elections may violate Section 2 if the system has a racially disparate impact in light of the Senate Factors . Starting in 2013 , lower federal courts began to consider various challenges to voter ID laws brought under Section 2 . 
 = = = = Specific prohibitions = = = = 
 The Act contains several specific prohibitions on conduct that may interfere with a person 's ability to cast an effective vote . One of these prohibitions is prescribed in Section 201 , which prohibits any jurisdiction from requiring a person to comply with any " test or device " to register to vote or cast a ballot . The term " test or device " is defined as literacy tests , educational or knowledge requirements , proof of good moral character , and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting . Before the Act 's enactment , these devices were the primary tools used by jurisdictions to prevent racial minorities from voting . Originally , the Act suspended tests or devices temporarily in jurisdictions covered by the Section 4 ( b ) coverage formula , but Congress subsequently expanded the prohibition to the entire country and made it permanent . Relatedly , Section 202 prohibits jurisdictions from imposing any " durational residency requirement " that requires persons to have lived in the jurisdiction for more than 30 days before being eligible to vote in a presidential election . 
 Several further protections for voters are contained in Section 11 . Section 11 ( a ) prohibits any person acting under color of law from refusing or failing to allow a qualified person to vote or to count a qualified voter 's ballot . Similarly , Section 11 ( b ) prohibits any person from intimidating , harassing , or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote . Two provisions in Section 11 address voter fraud : Section 11 ( c ) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election , and Section 11 ( e ) prohibits voting twice in a federal election . 
 Finally , under Section 208 , a jurisdiction may not prevent anyone who is English @-@ illiterate or has a disability from being accompanied into the ballot box by an assistant of the person 's choice . The only exceptions are that the assistant may not be an agent of the person 's employer or union . 
 = = = = Bail @-@ in = = = = 
 Section 3 ( c ) contains a " bail @-@ in " or " pocket trigger " process by which jurisdictions that fall outside the coverage formula of Section 4 ( b ) may become subject to preclearance . Under this provision , if a jurisdiction has racially discriminated against voters in violation of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments , a court may order the jurisdiction to have future changes to its election laws <unk> by the federal government . Because courts have interpreted the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to prohibit only intentional discrimination , a court may bail in a jurisdiction only if the plaintiff proves that the jurisdiction enacted or operated a voting practice to purposely discriminate . 
 Section 3 ( c ) contains its own preclearance language and differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways . Unlike Section 5 preclearance , which applies to a covered jurisdiction until such time as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4 ( a ) , bailed @-@ in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance for as long as the court orders . Moreover , the court may require the jurisdiction to <unk> only particular types of voting changes . For example , the bail @-@ in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans . This differs from Section 5 preclearance , which requires a covered jurisdiction to <unk> all of its voting changes . 
 During the Act 's early history , Section 3 ( c ) was little used ; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975 . Between 1975 and 2013 , 18 jurisdictions were bailed in , including 16 local governments and the states of Arkansas and New Mexico . Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4 ( b ) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder ( 2013 ) , it did not hold Section 3 ( c ) unconstitutional . Therefore , jurisdictions may continue to be bailed @-@ in and subjected to Section 3 ( c ) preclearance . In the months following Shelby County , courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina , and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in Evergreen , Alabama . 
 A more narrow bail @-@ in process pertaining to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3 ( a ) . Under this provision , a federal court may certify a non @-@ covered jurisdiction to receive federal observers if the court determines that the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments . Jurisdictions certified to receive federal observers under Section 3 ( a ) are not subject to preclearance . 
 = = = Special provisions = = = 
 = = = = Coverage formula = = = = 
 Section 4 ( b ) contains a " coverage formula " that determines which states and local governments may be subjected to the Act 's other special provisions ( except for the Section 203 ( c ) bilingual election requirements , which fall under a different formula ) . Congress intended for the coverage formula to encompass the most pervasively discriminatory jurisdictions . A jurisdiction is covered by the formula if : 
 As of November 1 , 1964 , 1968 , or 1972 , the jurisdiction used a " test or device " to restrict the opportunity to register and vote ; and 
 Less than half of the jurisdiction 's eligible citizens were registered to vote on November 1 , 1964 , 1968 , or 1972 ; or less than half of eligible citizens voted in the presidential election of November 1964 , 1968 , or 1972 . 
 As originally enacted , the coverage formula contained only November 1964 triggering dates ; subsequent revisions to the law supplemented it with the additional triggering dates of November 1968 and November 1972 , which brought more jurisdictions into coverage . For purposes of the coverage formula , the term " test or device " includes the same four devices prohibited nationally by Section 201 — literacy tests , educational or knowledge requirements , proof of good moral character , and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting — and one further device defined in Section 4 ( f ) ( 3 ) : in jurisdictions where more than 5 % of the citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group , any practice or requirement by which registration or election materials are provided only in English . The types of jurisdictions that the coverage formula applies to include states and " political subdivisions " of states . Section 14 ( c ) ( 2 ) defines " political subdivision " to mean any county , parish , or " other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for voting . " 
 Throughout its history , the coverage formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions , most of which were in the Deep South . In Shelby County v. Holder ( 2013 ) , the Supreme Court declared the coverage formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism . The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula , such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement , remain valid law . However , without a valid coverage formula , these provisions are unenforceable . 
 = = = = <unk> requirement = = = = 
 Section 5 requires that covered jurisdictions receive federal approval , known as " preclearance " , before implementing changes to their election laws . A covered jurisdiction has the burden of proving that the change does not have the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of race or language minority status ; if the jurisdiction fails to meet this burden , the federal government will deny preclearance and the jurisdiction 's change will not go into effect . The Supreme Court broadly interpreted Section 5 's scope in Allen v. State Board of Election ( 1969 ) , holding that any change in a jurisdiction 's voting practices , even if minor , must be submitted for preclearance . The Court also held that if a jurisdiction fails to have its voting change precleared , private plaintiffs may sue the jurisdiction in the plaintiff 's local district court before a three @-@ judge panel . In these Section 5 " enforcement actions " , a court considers whether the jurisdiction made a covered voting change , and if so , whether the change has been precleared . If the jurisdiction improperly failed to obtain preclearance , then the court will order the jurisdiction to obtain preclearance before implementing the change . However , the court may not consider the merits of whether the change should be approved . 
 Jurisdictions may seek preclearance through either an " administrative preclearance " process or a " judicial preclearance " process . If a jurisdiction seeks administrative preclearance , the Attorney General will consider whether the proposed change has a discriminatory purpose or effect . After the jurisdiction submits the proposed change , the Attorney General has 60 days to interpose an objection to it . The 60 @-@ day period may be extended an additional 60 days if the jurisdiction later submits additional information . If the Attorney General interposes an objection , then the change is not precleared and may not be implemented . The Attorney General 's decision is not subject to judicial review , but if the Attorney General interposes an objection , the jurisdiction may independently seek judicial preclearance , and the court may disregard the Attorney General 's objection at its discretion . If a jurisdiction seeks judicial preclearance , it must file a declaratory judgment action against the Attorney General in the U.S. District Court for D.C. A three @-@ judge panel will consider whether the voting change has a discriminatory purpose or effect , and the losing party may appeal directly to the Supreme Court . Private parties may intervene in judicial preclearance lawsuits . 
 In several cases , the Supreme Court has addressed the meaning of " discriminatory effect " and " discriminatory purpose " for Section 5 purposes . In Beer v. United States ( 1976 ) , the Court held that for a voting change to have a prohibited discriminatory effect , it must result in " retrogression " ( backsliding ) . Under this standard , a voting change that causes discrimination , but does not result in more discrimination than before the change was made , cannot be denied preclearance for having a discriminatory effect . For example , replacing a poll tax with an equally expensive voter registration fee is not a " retrogressive " change because it causes equal discrimination , not more . Relying on the Senate report for the Act , the Court reasoned that the retrogression standard was the correct interpretation of the term " discriminatory effect " because Section 5 's purpose is " ' to insure that [ the gains thus far achieved in minority political participation ] shall not be destroyed through new [ discriminatory ] procedures ' " . The retrogression standard applies irrespective of whether the voting change allegedly causes vote denial or vote dilution . 
 In 2003 , the Supreme Court held in Georgia v. Ashcroft that courts should not determine that a new redistricting plan has a retrogressive effect solely because the plan decreases the number of minority @-@ majority districts . The Court emphasized that judges should analyze various other factors under the " totality of the circumstances " , such as whether the redistricting plan increases the number of " influence districts " in which a minority group is large enough to influence ( but not decide ) election outcomes . In 2006 , Congress overturned this decision by amending Section 5 to explicitly state that " diminishing the ability [ of a protected minority ] to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the meaning of " Section 5 . Uncertainty remains as to what this language precisely means and how courts may interpret it . 
 Before 2000 , the " discriminatory purpose " prong of Section 5 was understood to mean any discriminatory purpose , which is the same standard used to determine whether discrimination is unconstitutional . In Reno v. Bossier Parish ( Bossier Parish II ) ( 2000 ) , the Supreme Court extended the retrogression standard , holding that for a voting change to have a " discriminatory purpose " under Section 5 , the change must have been implemented for a retrogressive purpose . Therefore , a voting change intended to discriminate against a protected minority was permissible under Section 5 so long as the change was not intended to increase existing discrimination . This change significantly reduced the number of instances in which preclearance was denied based on discriminatory purpose . In 2006 , Congress overturned Bossier Parish II by amending Section 5 to explicitly define " purpose " to mean " any discriminatory purpose . " 
 = = = = Federal examiners and observers = = = = 
 Until the 2006 amendments to the Act , Section 6 allowed the appointment of " federal examiners " to oversee certain jurisdictions ' voter registration functions . Federal examiners could be assigned to a covered jurisdiction if the Attorney General certified that 
 The Department of Justice received 20 or more meritorious complaints that the covered jurisdiction denied its residents the right to vote based on race or language minority status ; or 
 The assignment of federal examiners was otherwise necessary to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments . 
 Federal examiners had the authority to register voters , examine voter registration applications , and maintain voter rolls . The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process , such as refusing to register qualified applicants , purging qualified voters from the voter rolls , and limiting the hours during which persons could register . Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act 's enactment , but their importance waned over time ; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote . In 2006 , Congress repealed the provision . 
 Under the Act 's original framework , in any jurisdiction certified for federal examiners , the Attorney General could additionally require the appointment of " federal observers " . By 2006 , the federal examiner provision was used solely as a means to appoint federal observers . When Congress repealed the federal examiner provision in 2006 , Congress amended Section 8 to allow for the assignment of federal observers to jurisdictions that satisfied the same certification criteria that had been used to appoint federal examiners . 
 Federal observers are tasked with observing poll worker and voter conduct at polling places during an election and observing election officials tabulate the ballots . The goal of the federal observer provision is to facilitate minority voter participation by deterring and documenting instances of discriminatory conduct in the election process , such as election officials denying qualified minority persons the right to cast a ballot , intimidation or harassment of voters on election day , or improper vote counting . Discriminatory conduct that federal observers document may also serve as evidence in subsequent enforcement lawsuits . Since 1965 , the Attorney General has certified 153 local governments across 11 states , but given time and resource constraints , federal observers are not assigned to every certified jurisdiction for every election . Separate provisions allow for a certified jurisdiction to " bail out " of its certification . 
 = = = = Bailout = = = = 
 Under Section 4 ( a ) , a covered jurisdiction may seek exemption from coverage through a process called " bailout . " To achieve an exemption , a covered jurisdiction must obtain a declaratory judgment from a three @-@ judge panel of the District Court for D.C. that the jurisdiction is eligible to bail out . As originally enacted , a covered jurisdiction was eligible to bail out if it had not used a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request . Therefore , a jurisdiction that requested to bail out in 1967 would have needed to prove that it had not misused a test or device since at least 1962 . Until 1970 , this effectively required a covered jurisdiction to prove that it had not misused a test or device since before the Act was enacted five years earlier in 1965 , making it impossible for many covered jurisdictions to bail out . However , Section 4 ( a ) also prohibited covered jurisdictions from using tests or devices in any manner , discriminatory or otherwise ; hence , under the original Act , a covered jurisdiction would become eligible for bailout in 1970 by simply complying with this requirement . But in the course of amending the Act in 1970 and 1975 to extend the special provisions , Congress also extended the period of time that a covered jurisdiction must not have misused a test or device to 10 years and then to 17 years , respectively . These extensions continued the effect of requiring jurisdictions to prove that they had not misused a test or device since before the Act 's enactment in 1965 . 
 In 1982 , Congress amended Section 4 ( a ) to make bailout easier to achieve in two ways . First , Congress provided that if a state is covered , local governments in that state may bail out even if the state is ineligible to bail out . Second , Congress liberalized the eligibility criteria by replacing the 17 @-@ year requirement with a new standard , allowing a covered jurisdiction to bail out by proving that in the 10 years preceding its bailout request : 
 The jurisdiction did not use a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect ; 
 No court determined that the jurisdiction denied or abridged the right to vote based on racial or language minority status ; 
 The jurisdiction complied with the preclearance requirement ; 
 The federal government did not assign federal examiners to the jurisdiction ; 
 The jurisdiction abolished discriminatory election practices ; and 
 The jurisdiction took affirmative steps to eliminate voter intimidation and expand voting opportunities for protected minorities . 
 Additionally , Congress required jurisdictions seeking bailout to produce evidence of minority registration and voting rates , including how these rates have changed over time and in comparison to the registration and voting rates of the majority . If the court determines that the covered jurisdiction is eligible for bailout , it will enter a declaratory judgment in the jurisdiction 's favor . The court will retain jurisdiction for the following 10 years and may order the jurisdiction back into coverage if the jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination . 
 The 1982 amendment to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5 , 1984 . Between that date and 2013 , 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions ; in each instance , the Attorney General consented to the bailout request . Between that date and 2009 , all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia . In 2009 , a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court 's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder ( 2009 ) , which held that local governments that do not register voters have the ability to bail out . After this ruling , jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder ( 2013 ) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional . 
 Separate provisions allow a covered jurisdiction that has been certified to receive federal observers to bail out of its certification alone . Under Section 13 , the Attorney General may terminate the certification of a jurisdiction if 1 ) more than 50 % of the jurisdiction 's minority voting age population is registered to vote , and 2 ) there is no longer reasonable cause to believe that residents may experience voting discrimination . Alternatively , the District Court for D.C. may order the certification terminated . 
 = = = = Bilingual election requirements = = = = 
 Two provisions require certain jurisdictions to provide election materials to voters in multiple languages : Section 4 ( f ) ( 4 ) and Section 203 ( c ) . A jurisdiction covered by either provision must provide all materials related to an election — such as voter registration materials , ballots , notices , and instructions — in the language of any applicable language minority group residing in the jurisdiction . Language minority groups protected by these provisions include Asian Americans , Hispanics , Native Americans , and Native Alaskans . Congress enacted the provisions to break down language barriers and combat pervasive language discrimination against the protected groups . 
 Section 4 ( f ) ( 4 ) applies to any jurisdiction encompassed by the Section 4 ( b ) coverage formula where more than 5 % of the citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group . Section 203 ( c ) contains a formula that is separate from the Section 4 ( b ) coverage formula , and therefore jurisdictions covered solely by 203 ( c ) are not subject to the Act 's other special provisions , such as preclearance . The Section 203 ( c ) formula encompasses jurisdictions where the following conditions exist : 
 A single language minority is present that has an English @-@ illiteracy rate higher than the national average ; and 
 Either : 
 The number of " limited @-@ English proficient " members of the language minority group is at least 10 @,@ 000 voting @-@ age citizens or large enough to comprise at least 5 % of the jurisdiction 's voting @-@ age citizen population ; or 
 The jurisdiction is a political subdivision that contains an Indian reservation , and more than 5 % of the jurisdiction 's American Indian or Alaska Native voting @-@ age citizens are members of a single language minority and are limited @-@ English proficient . 
 Section 203 ( b ) defines " limited @-@ English proficient " as being " unable to speak or understand English adequately enough to participate in the electoral process " . Determinations as to which jurisdictions satisfy the Section 203 ( c ) criteria occur once a decade following completion of the decennial census ; at these times , new jurisdictions may come into coverage while others may have their coverage terminated . Additionally , under Section 203 ( d ) , a jurisdiction may " bail out " of Section 203 ( c ) coverage by proving in federal court that no language minority group within the jurisdiction has an English illiteracy rate that is higher than the national illiteracy rate . After the 2010 census , 150 jurisdictions across 25 states were covered under Section 203 ( c ) , including statewide coverage of California , Texas , and Florida .

 After its enactment in 1965 , the law immediately decreased racial discrimination in voting . The suspension of literacy tests and assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for high numbers of racial minorities to register to vote . Nearly 250 @,@ 000 African Americans registered in 1965 , one @-@ third of whom were registered by federal examiners . In covered jurisdictions , less than one @-@ third ( 29 @.@ 3 % ) of the African American population was registered in 1965 ; by 1967 , this number increased to more than half ( 52 @.@ 1 % ) , and a majority of African American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states . Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office : between 1965 and 1985 , African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former Confederate states increased from 3 to 176 . Nationwide , the number of African American elected officials increased from 1 @,@ 469 in 1970 to 4 @,@ 912 in 1980 . By 2011 , the number was approximately 10 @,@ 500 . Similarly , registration rates for language minority groups increased after Congress enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992 . In 1973 , the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34 @.@ 9 % ; by 2006 , that amount nearly doubled . The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58 % by 2006 . 
 After the Act 's initial success in combating tactics designed to deny minorities access to the polls , the Act became predominately used as a tool to challenge racial vote dilution . Starting in the 1970s , the Attorney General commonly raised Section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased the effectiveness of racial minorities ' votes , including discriminatory annexations , redistricting plans , and election methods such as at @-@ large election systems , runoff election requirements , and prohibitions on bullet voting . In total , 81 % ( 2 @,@ 541 ) of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote dilution . Claims brought under Section 2 have also predominately concerned vote dilution . Between the 1982 creation of the Section 2 results test and 2006 , at least 331 Section 2 lawsuits resulted in published judicial opinions . In the 1980s , 60 % of Section 2 lawsuits challenged at @-@ large election systems ; in the 1990s , 37 @.@ 2 % challenged at @-@ large election systems and 38 @.@ 5 % challenged redistricting plans . Overall , plaintiffs succeeded in 37 @.@ 2 % of the 331 lawsuits , and they were more likely to succeed in lawsuits brought against covered jurisdictions . 
 By enfranchising racial minorities , the Act facilitated a political realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties . Between 1890 and 1965 , minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate Southern politics . After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law , newly enfranchised racial minorities began to vote for liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South , and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse . These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically polarize , with the Democratic Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative . The trends also created competition between the two parties , which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy . Over the subsequent decades , the creation of majority @-@ minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments . By packing liberal @-@ leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority @-@ minority districts , large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white , conservative , and Republican . While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended , it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall . By the mid @-@ 1990s , these trends culminated in a political realignment : the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties , respectively ; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South , with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics .

 = = = Voter eligibility provisions = = = 
 Early in the Act 's enforcement history , the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting . In Katzenbach v. Morgan ( 1966 ) , the Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 4 ( e ) . This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth @-@ grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish , such as schools in Puerto Rico . Although the Court had earlier held in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections ( 1959 ) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment , in Morgan the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights — such as the right to vote — by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights , even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional . After Congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201 , the Court upheld the ban as constitutional in Oregon v. Mitchell ( 1970 ) . 
 In Oregon , the Supreme Court also addressed the constitutionality of various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting . The Court upheld Section 202 , which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election . Additionally , the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections , but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections ; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty @-@ sixth Amendment the following year , which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18 . The Court was deeply divided in Oregon , and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding . 
 = = = Section 2 results test = = = 
 The constitutionality of Section 2 , which contains a general prohibition on discriminatory voting laws , has not been definitively explained by the Supreme Court . As amended in 1982 , Section 2 prohibits any voting practice that has a discriminatory effect , irrespective of whether the practice was enacted or is administered for the purpose of discriminating . This " results test " contrasts with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments , both of which directly prohibit only purposeful discrimination . Given this disparity , whether the Supreme Court would uphold the constitutionality of Section 2 as appropriate legislation passed to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments , and under what rationale , remains unclear . 
 In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks ( 1984 ) , the Supreme Court summarily affirmed , without a written opinion , a lower court 's decision that Section 2 is constitutional . Justice Rehnquist , joined by Chief Justice Burger , dissented from the opinion . Their reasoning was that the case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing . In later cases , the Supreme Court is more likely to disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion , but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court 's unwritten summary <unk> as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions . Partially due to Brooks , the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts . 
 = = = Coverage formula and preclearance = = = 
 The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the Section 5 preclearance requirement in three cases . The first case was South Carolina v. Katzenbach ( 1966 ) , which was decided about five months after the Act 's enactment . The Court held that Section 5 constituted a valid use of Congress 's power to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment , reasoning that " exceptional circumstances " of pervasive racial discrimination , combined with the inadequacy of case @-@ by @-@ case litigation in ending that discrimination , justified the preclearance requirement . The Court also upheld the constitutionality of the 1965 coverage formula , saying that it was " rational in both practice and theory " and that the bailout provision provided adequate relief for jurisdictions that may not deserve coverage . 
 The Supreme Court again upheld the preclearance requirement in City of Rome v. United States ( 1980 ) . The Court held that because Congress had explicit constitutional power to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments " by appropriate legislation " , the Act did not violate principles of federalism . The Court also explicitly upheld the " discriminatory effect " prong of Section 5 , stating that even though the Fifteenth Amendment directly prohibited only intentional discrimination , Congress could constitutionally prohibit unintentional discrimination to mitigate the risk that jurisdictions may engage in intentional discrimination . Finally , the Court upheld the 1975 extension of Section 5 because of the record of discrimination that continued to persist in the covered jurisdictions . The Court further suggested that the temporary nature of the special provisions was relevant to Section 5 's constitutionality . 
 The final case in which the Supreme Court upheld Section 5 was Lopez v. Monterey County ( Lopez II ) ( 1999 ) . In Lopez II , the Court reiterated its reasoning in Katzenbach and Rome , and it upheld as constitutional the requirement that covered local governments obtain preclearance before implementing voting changes that their parent state required them to implement , even if the parent state was not itself a covered jurisdiction . 
 The 2006 extension of Section 5 was challenged before the Supreme Court in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder ( 2009 ) . The lawsuit was brought by a municipal water district in Texas that elected members to a water board . The District wished to move a voting location from a private home to a public school , but that change was subject to preclearance because Texas was a covered jurisdiction . The District did not register voters , and thus it did not appear to qualify as a " political subdivision " eligible to bail out of coverage . Although the Court indicated in dicta ( a non @-@ binding part of the court 's opinion ) that Section 5 presented difficult constitutional questions , it did not declare Section 5 unconstitutional ; instead , it interpreted the law to allow any covered local government , including one that does not register voters , to obtain an exemption from preclearance if it meets the bailout requirements . 
 On November 9 , 2012 , the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the case of Shelby County v. Holder limited to the question of " whether Congress ' decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre @-@ existing coverage formula of Section 4 ( b ) ... exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments , thus violating the Tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution " . On June 25 , 2013 , the Court struck down Section 4 ( b ) as unconstitutional . The Court reasoned that the coverage formula violates the constitutional principles of " equal sovereignty of the states " and federalism because its disparate treatment of the states is " based on 40 year @-@ old facts having no logical relationship to the present day " , which makes the formula unresponsive to current needs . The Court did not strike down Section 5 , but without Section 4 ( b ) , no jurisdiction may be subject to Section 5 preclearance unless Congress enacts a new coverage formula . After the decision , several states that were fully or partially covered — including Texas , Mississippi , North Carolina , and South Carolina — implemented laws that were previously denied preclearance . This prompted new legal challenges to these laws under other provisions unaffected by the Court 's decision , such as Section 2 . 
 = = = Racial gerrymandering = = = 
 While Section 2 and Section 5 prohibit jurisdictions from drawing electoral districts that dilute the votes of protected minorities , the Supreme Court has held that in some instances , the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents jurisdictions from drawing district lines to favor protected minorities . The Court first recognized the justiciability of affirmative " racial gerrymandering " claims in Shaw v. Reno ( 1993 ) . In Miller v. Johnson ( 1995 ) , the Court explained that a redistricting plan is constitutionally suspect if the jurisdiction used race as the " predominant factor " in determining how to draw district lines . For race to " predominate " , the jurisdiction must prioritize racial considerations over traditional redistricting principles , which include " compactness , contiguity , [ and ] respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests . " If a court concludes that racial considerations predominated , then the redistricting plan is considered " racially gerrymandered " and must be subjected to strict scrutiny , meaning that the redistricting plan will be upheld as constitutional only if it is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest . In Bush v. Vera ( 1996 ) , a plurality of the Supreme Court assumed that complying with Section 2 or Section 5 constituted compelling interests , and lower courts have allowed only these two interests to justify racial gerrymandering .

 As the matches were often played consecutively without a day between fixtures , Australia employed a rotation policy , and as a result , Hassett captained the team in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested . Under Hassett 's watch , Australia won seven matches , five of these by an innings , while both draws were rain @-@ affected fixtures in which more than half the playing time was lost . Hassett had two close encounters , both on damp pitches before the First Test . Against Yorkshire , Australia scraped home by four wickets in a low @-@ scoring match with ten men after Sam Loxton succumbed to injury . In a later match against Hampshire , Australia ceded a first innings lead for the first time on tour , but recovered to win by eight wickets . 
 Hassett ended the first @-@ class matches with 1 @,@ 563 runs at a batting average of 74 @.@ 22 including seven centuries . Among the Australians , he had the third highest aggregate behind Bradman and Arthur Morris and the second highest average . His highest score was an unbeaten 200 against the Gentlemen of England . Hassett was less successful in the Tests , scoring 310 runs at 44 @.@ 28 with one century . This placed him fourth in the Australian aggregates , but only seventh in the averages . His biggest contribution was his 137 in the first innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge . It was a patient innings as England attempted to stop Australia 's scoring with defensive leg theory ; Hassett helped the tourists set up a first innings lead of 344 , which laid the foundation for the eventual victory . He had three scores between 35 and 50 during the Tests , but was unable to convert his starts into large innings . Hassett took 23 catches on the tour , the most by an Australia excluding wicket @-@ keepers . 
 Hassett was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1949 . Wisden remarked that " in addition to his playing ability Hassett 's cheerfulness and leadership , which extended to off @-@ the @-@ field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme , combined to make him an ideal vice @-@ captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman 's busy shoulders " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The 1948 tour was Hassett 's second Test campaign in England . A diminutive right @-@ handed batsman , he toured England under Bradman in 1938 , making his Test debut during the series and playing in all four matches . Following the interruption of World War II , Hassett led the Australian Services — a military team — in the Victory Tests . He became a regular member of the Test team and was the vice @-@ captain under Bradman for the series against England and India in Australia during 1946 – 47 and 1947 – 48 respectively . In the latter Test series , he averaged 110 @.@ 66 with the bat , and he was duly selected for the tour of England , continuing in his role as Bradman 's deputy . 
 = = Early tour = = 
 Australia traditionally fielded its first @-@ choice team in the tour opener , which was customarily against Worcestershire . Hassett thus played as vice @-@ captain of Bradman 's first @-@ choice team and took a catch as Australia dismissed the hosts for 233 . However , when Australia batted , Bradman rearranged the order and Hassett came in at No. 7 with Australia ’ s score at 5 / 320 after losing 4 / 55 in a middle @-@ order collapse . Hassett made 25 in 66 minutes with three fours as Australia declared at 8 / 462 ; the hosts were bowled out for 212 to complete an Australian victory by an innings and 17 runs . Hassett was rested for next match against Leicestershire , which resulted in another innings win for the tourists . 
 The Australians then proceeded to play Yorkshire at Bradford , on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling ; rain delayed the start of the match until midway through the first afternoon . Bradman rested himself and returned to London while Hassett led the team . Yorkshire elected to bat and were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71 , despite Australia losing all rounder Sam Loxton with a hamstring injury . Australia replied with 101 without Loxton , who was unable to bat . Hassett came in at 1 / 24 and was immediately out for a duck . Australia then bowled out the hosts in the second innings for 89 . Chasing 60 for victory , Hassett elected to not ask for the pitch to be rolled . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett " might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [ erratic bounce and sideways movement ] out of the pitch " . Australia lost quick wickets and Hassett came in with the score at 2 / 5 . Keith Miller was then out at 3 / 13 after attempting to hit a six , while Hassett was nervous after his first innings duck . Ron Hamence joined Hassett and they took the score to 20 before the former was run out attempting a quick single . Without further addition to the score , Hassett attempted a pull shot and top edged it so high that five players had the time to converge and any of these could have caught the ball . The catch was eventually taken directly in front of Hassett , leaving Australia at 5 / 20 . To make matters worse , Loxton was still too injured to bat , so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912 . Neil Harvey had scored a solitary run when he was dropped at short leg . Colin McCool fell at 6 / 31 , and Harvey and new partner Don Tallon were both given lives before the tourists scraped home by four wickets . It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour , and Hassett was very relieved , playing his head in his hands and muttering " Why me ? Why is it always me ? " in a reference to his encountering rain @-@ affected wickets as captain . 
 Bradman returned to lead the Australians in the next match against Surrey at The Oval in London ; Australia won the toss and batted first . Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris put on 136 , before Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 before the opener fell for 176 . Hassett came in and Bradman was dismissed for 146 at 3 / 403 . Hassett struck form and reached his first century for the English summer , posting 110 before being clean bowled by Test seamer Alec Bedser as Australia were bowled out for 632 . Bedser pitched an outswinger on leg stump and it moved away to clip Hassett 's off stump . Bradman ’ s men then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings . 
 Bradman rested himself for the next match against Cambridge University , and Hassett led the tourists to another innings victory after the hosts won the toss and elected to bat . After Cambridge had made 167 , Hassett scored an unbeaten 61 in a partnership of 140 with Bill Brown before declaring at 4 / 414 when Brown fell for 200 . Hassett 's bowlers then dismissed the hosts for 196 in the second innings , sealing victory by an innings and 51 runs . In the following match against Essex , Bradman returned and Hassett was rested as Australia won the toss and batted first , scoring a world @-@ record of 721 first @-@ class runs in one day . The visitors then proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs , their biggest winning margin for the summer . Bradman then rested himself for the next game against Oxford University , where Hassett oversaw another innings victory . Hassett made a duck , caught from a rearing ball from paceman Philip Whitcombe , as Australia made 431 and then enforced the follow on . 
 The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and were basically a full @-@ strength Test team , while Australia selected their first @-@ choice team . Bradman captained the team and batted at No. 3 with Hassett in his customary position at No. 4 . Barring one change in the bowling department , the same team would line up for Australia in the First Test , with the top six batsmen in the same position . It was a chance for players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests . Australia elected to bat and Hassett came in to join Bradman at 2 / 171 . The pair took the score to 200 before Bradman fell for 98 to leave Australia at 3 / 200 . Hassett then put on 80 with Miller before being trapped leg before wicket ( lbw ) for 51 by Jack Young . Fingleton hailed Hassett 's display as " the prettiest half century we saw in the whole summer . There was not effort in his play . The ball sped quietly and quickly in all directions . " Bradman 's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings , with Hassett catching Len Hutton and Ken Cranston in the first innings . 
 The MCC match was followed by Australia 's first non @-@ victory of the tour , which was against Lancashire . Hassett was rested as the first day was washed out and the match ended in a draw . In the following match against Nottinghamshire , the hosts batted first and made 179 . Hassett made 44 and featured in a partnership of 81 with Keith Miller as the tourists reached 400 . However , Nottinghamshire ended at 8 / 299 to hang on for a draw in the second innings . Bradman rested himself for the following match against Hampshire , and Hassett oversaw another scare . On a drying pitch , Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side 's 195 , the first time they had conceded a first innings lead on tour . Australia had made a solid start , reaching 2 / 70 before Hassett fell for 26 , sparking a collapse of 8 / 47 to be all out for 117 . This prompted Bradman to telegram Hassett : " Bradford was bad enough but this is unbearable , heads up and chins down . " Hampshire were then bowled out for 103 , leaving Australia a target of 182 , which they reached to seal an eight @-@ wicket win , with Hassett unbeaten on 27 . The final match before the First Test was against Sussex . Hassett was rested as Australia skittled the hosts for 86 and declared at 5 / 549 , before completing another innings victory . 
 = = First Test = = 
 Australia headed into the First Test at Trent Bridge with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches , including eight innings victories . England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour . The surface had <unk> up following overnight rain . Australia 's fast bowlers reduced England to 8 / 74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first day . The tourists had already taken the lead by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4 / 185 on the second afternoon . The hard @-@ hitting Miller had come in at No. 4 , the more Hassett 's usual position , indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack , but the change in batting order failed as Miller was out for a duck . 
 Australia had been scoring slowly , as they would throughout the day , and following Hassett 's entrance , the Australians slowed further as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once . Hassett almost holed out early when he knocked a ball from Alec Bedser up in the air and it just evaded the grasp of wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans . Yardley continued to employ leg theory , as he and Charlie Barnett bowled outside leg stump ; this tactic stifled the Australian scoring but also limited wicket @-@ taking opportunities . During one over , Bradman did not attempt to hit a single ball and put his hands on his hips to express his displeasure at England ’ s tactics . During the 15 minutes before tea , the Australian skipper did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd . In the last session , Bradman brought up one of his slowest ever centuries , as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking Australian wickets . Bradman reached stumps on 130 . Hassett also batted patiently , with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30 . Australia closed the second day at 4 / 293 to lead by 128 , with Hassett on 41 , having combined for an unbroken stand of 108 with Bradman . 
 Early on the third day , Bradman fell for 138 with the score at 5 / 305 . Yardley again pinned Hassett down with more leg theory . Laker bowled with one slip , while Young had none and employed a pure ring field . The scoring was slow during this passage of play — Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26 @-@ over spell conceded only 14 runs . In the face of the slow proceedings , Hassett conducted himself in a humorous way , and English commentator John Arlott said that " only his grace and concealed humour made his innings tolerable " . He mainly scored from deflections and was for the most part prepared to take his time . The injured Ray Lindwall came out to join Hassett at 7 / 365 without a runner . Hassett — who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the morning — swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match . Hassett added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94 . Australia were unhurried and remained patient in the face of Yardley ’ s defensive tactics because they had bowled England out on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result . After the break , Hassett reached his first Test century on English <unk> from 305 minutes . He then accelerated , adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes , before being bowled by Bedser , having struck 20 fours and a six . This ended an eighth @-@ wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall with the score at 8 / 473 ; Australia ended at 509 to take a 344 @-@ run first innings lead . 
 During England ’ s second innings , Joe Hardstaff , Jr. fell for 43 , lofting Ernie Toshack to Hassett on the leg side to end a partnership of 93 with Denis Compton . The ball looped up in the air and travelled half @-@ way to the square leg boundary , but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog . Australia eventually finished off the hosts for 441 , leaving them a target of 98 on the final afternoon . Australia proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell . Bradman came in and was out for a duck . This left Australia at 2 / 48 , at which point dark clouds began to close in on the ground , and it appeared that rain might save England . However , it never came , and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes . The pair attacked , Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries , and later pulling another ball in the air for another four . The tourists reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting . Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary , but ran off the field with a souvenir stump , believing that the match was over . He returned to the field when he noticed the crowd reaction ; Hassett hit the winning run to end with an unbeaten 21 . 
 Between Tests , Bradman rested himself for the match against Northamptonshire , which started the day after the Test . Hassett won the toss and elected to bowl ; his bowlers ensured that the decision paid off by bowling out the hosts for 119 . When Australia batted , Hassett came in at 1 / 17 and added 122 runs for the second wicket with Morris before combining for another 104 with Ron Hamence . Hassett was eventually out for the top score of 127 , having played with flair and freedom he eschewed in the Tests , before Australia declared at 8 / 352 . The bowlers then removed Northamptonshire for 169 , giving Australia a victory by an innings and 64 runs . Hassett also took five catches for the match . He was rested for the second match against Yorkshire , which was drawn . 
 = = Second Test = = 
 Australia opted to field an unchanged lineup for the Second Test at Lord 's . Bradman elected to bat , allowing Lindwall more time to recover from a groin strain before being required to bowl . Hassett came in to join Morris at 2 / 87 when Bradman fell soon after lunch on the first day . The new ball was available , but England had declined to take it . Bedser beat Hassett second ball with a delivery that moved back in , but the appeal for lbw was turned down . However , Yardley opted to not take the ball , and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain finally called for a replacement ball . Journalist and retired Australian cricketer Bill O 'Reilly said that the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a failure to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett . 
 The pair added 79 before Morris fell for 105 and Miller was out seven runs later at 4 / 173 . By taking two quick wickets , England had put the match back in the balance . Batting out of position in the middle order , Brown came in and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings . Both scored slowly , averaging more than three and half minutes for each run . Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley , who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate , broke through his defences with a yorker , dismissing him for 47 after 175 minutes of batting ; the English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia 6 / 225 . Australia recovered to 350 on the second morning , and England were then bowled out on the third morning for 215 . Australia 's top @-@ order scored quickly and Hassett came in with the score at 2 / 296 after 277 minutes of batting . Yardley bowled Hassett first ball off the inside edge , so Miller came to the crease at 3 / 296 to face the hat @-@ trick ball . Miller survived a loud lbw appeal to deny the English captain a hat @-@ trick . Australia then declared at 7 / 460 on the fourth day to leave England a target of 596 , which would have taken a world record run @-@ chase for victory . Hassett caught Alec Bedser from the bowling of Bill Johnston as Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 early on the final morning to win by 409 runs . 
 The next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Lord ’ s Test . Australia elected to field and dismissed the hosts for 221 . Brown injured a finger while fielding and was unable to bat in Australia 's first innings . Hamence filled in as an opener alongside Hassett but was out for a duck , so Bradman joined his deputy with the score at 1 / 6 . The Australian skipper put on 231 with Hassett , who top @-@ scored with 139 . Accelerating after reaching his century , Hassett was out for 4 / 289 and the tourists collapsed to be all out for 389 , after losing 7 / 100 . In the second innings , Australia 's makeshift openers Harvey and Sam Loxton chased down the 122 runs required for a 10 @-@ wicket win in less than hour , so Hassett was not required to bat . 
 Bradman rested himself for the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test . Hassett led the team and elected to bat as Australia reached 7 / 774 declared on the second day . It was the tourists ’ highest score for the tour and the second best by any Australian team on English soil . Hassett instructed his batsmen to attack local off spinner Tom Goddard , who was seen as a possible selection for England in the Third Test . His batsmen used their feet to charge at Goddard , who was used to batsmen playing him from static positions , and could not cope . Goddard took 0 / 186 from 32 overs and his chances of being selected ended . However , Hassett was unable to join the plunder , making only 21 . He then enforced the follow on as the hosts were out for 279 and 132 to cede victory by an innings and 363 runs . Hassett allowed himself to bowl for the first time on tour , sending down two overs for eight runs without taking a wicket . 
 = = Third Test = = 
 The teams reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test . Australia replaced Brown — who had scored 73 runs at 24 @.@ 33 in three innings — with the all rounder Loxton , who had made an unbeaten 47 against Surrey and 159 not out against Gloucestershire . England made 363 after electing to bat . On the second day , Australia were in trouble when Hassett came in at 2 / 13 . Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings , adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter was beaten in flight by Jack Young . Aiming to break Young 's restrictive leg side bowling , Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four . However , in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover , he mishit the ball , which was caught by Cyril Washbrook at wide mid @-@ off . This left Australia at 3 / 82 and they eventually made 221 to avoid the follow on by eight runs . 
 In England 's second innings , Lindwall bounced Washbrook and the England opener went for the hook shot . The ball flew in the air straight towards fine leg , where Hassett dropped the ball on the third attempt . At the time , Washbrook was on 21 . The English batsman had moved to 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett . The Australian vice @-@ captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman before humorously gesturing to indicate that he was ready for the next catch , much to the amusement of the crowd . On 80 , Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack . After the day 's play , Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink ; England were in a strong position at 3 / 174 , with an overall lead of 316 . Luckily for Australia , the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little . Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition to their score midway through the last day ; the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain . Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to reach 1 / 92 and ensure that the match ended in a draw . 
 After Old Trafford , Hassett was rested as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests . 
 = = Fourth Test = = 
 The teams then headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test . Australia made two changes . Neil Harvey replaced the injured Barnes , while Ron Saggers replaced Don Tallon — who had a finger injury — behind the stumps . The reserve opener Brown was not recalled to open in the absence of Barnes ; instead , Hassett would improvise and open with Morris , while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle @-@ order . As Australia led 2 – 0 after three Tests , England needed to win the last two matches to square the series . The home team won the toss and elected to bat on a batsman @-@ friendly pitch . Hassett dropped Len Hutton — who went on to score 81 — on 25 . England ’ s first @-@ wicket partnership was broken at 168 and was their first opening stand beyond 42 for the series . The hosts were eventually out for 496 on the second day . Hassett caught England wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans , who meekly prodded a ball from Sam Loxton straight to silly mid @-@ on . 
 With Barnes injured , Hassett moved from the middle @-@ order to open the innings with Morris . Bedser removed Morris for six to leave Australia at 1 / 13 , bringing Bradman to the crease . Hassett batted in a restrained manner , while Bradman attacked . The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1 / 63 . Bradman did the majority of the scoring during the closing stages of the afternoon , adding 31 in a partnership of 50 . On the third morning , play resumed in hot and humid conditions . In the second over delivered by Dick Pollard , the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly . Hassett was unable to get out of the way and edged the ball to Jack Crapp for 13 . Bradman was out in the same over and Australia were in trouble at 3 / 68 , but they recovered after a middle @-@ order counterattack took them to 458 early on the fourth day . Hassett then caught Bedser during England 's second innings . 
 England declared at 8 / 365 after two overs on the last day . Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller , which would help to break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin . Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all , demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult . 
 Yardley ’ s declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting team . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target ; the local press wrote them off and predicted that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket that was expected to favour the spin bowlers . Morris and Hassett started slowly , scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a surface that offered spin and bounce . It appeared that they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try and achieve the target at a later point . Only 44 runs came in the first hour , meaning that 360 runs were still needed in 285 minutes . Evans then missed a leg @-@ side stumping opportunity against Hassett as Bedser beat both openers with extra bounce . Hassett was dismissed by Compton 's left @-@ arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57 . The Englishman ’ s delivery had caught Hassett 's leading edge and he dived forward in his follow through to take a one @-@ handed catch just above the ground . Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes . The English spinners created a number of chances against both batsmen , but multiple catches and stumping opportunities were fumbled . Aside from the missed wicket @-@ taking opportunities , the spinners were erratic in line and length and Bradman and Morris plundered many boundaries . Australia went on to complete the world record chase with seven wickets and 15 minutes in hand , ensuring an unassailable 3 – 0 series lead . 
 Hassett was rested as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings immediately after the Fourth Test . He then led the team in place of the resting Bradman in the next match against Glamorgan , a rain @-@ affected draw that did not reach the second innings . The hosts fell for 197 and Hassett was unbeaten on 71 as Australia reached 3 / 215 — having featured in a partnership of 126 with Miller — when the weather ended the match . 
 In response to the home side 's 138 , Hassett top @-@ scored with 68 in Australia 's first innings of 254 before being trapped leg before wicket by Eric Hollies as the tourists defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets . Hollies 's 8 / 107 was the best innings bowling figures against the Australians for the summer . The feat earned him selection for the Fifth Test , where he dismissed Bradman in his final Test innings for a duck . 
 Hassett was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour . Bradman then rested himself and Hassett captained in the non @-@ first @-@ class match against Durham , a rain @-@ affected draw that did not reach the second innings . Hassett made three while batting at No. 8 as Australia made 282 and then had the hosts at 5 / 73 when rain washed out the match after the first day . 
 = = Fifth Test = = 
 Australia then headed to The Oval for the Fifth Test . Barnes returned from injury , so Hassett returned to his customary position in the middle order . England elected to bat on a rain @-@ affected pitch . Propelled by Lindwall 's 6 / 20 , the tourists skittled Yardley ’ s men for 52 in 42 @.@ 1 overs on the first afternoon . With the score at 1 / 10 , Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston . Edrich failed to get the ball in the middle of the bat and it looped up and travelled around 10 m . Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg , diving sideways to get two hands to the ball . Soon after , Lindwall bounced Compton , resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon . However , the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders . Hutton called Compton through for a run , but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic . Luckily for Compton , the ball went to Hassett at third man , who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball , thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out . However , Compton only made four before being dismissed , so Australia lost little from Hassett 's sportsmanship . 
 In contrast , Australia batted with apparent ease , as the overcast skies cleared and sun came out late on the first afternoon . The opening partnership had reached 117 before Hollies removed Barnes for 61 . This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18 : 00 . As Bradman had announced that the tour would be his last at international level , the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once . With 6 @,@ 996 Test career runs , he only needed four runs to average 100 @.@ 00 in Test cricket . On the second ball , Hollies bowled Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward . Bradman appeared stunned and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion , receiving another large round of applause . 
 Hassett came in with the score at 2 / 117 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2 / 153 . Morris was unbeaten on 77 and Hassett 10 . The next day , the pair took the score to 226 before their 109 @-@ run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting . As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply on the first day and were already well in the lead , they had plenty of time to complete a victory , so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace . The following batsmen were unable to string together substantial partnerships and Australia ended at 389 . When England batted again , Allan Watkins pulled Doug Ring to the leg side and straight into the hands of Hassett , who did not need to move from his position on the boundary , leaving England at 6 / 167 . The home team were eventually out for 188 and Australia thus sealed the series 4 – 0 with an innings victory . 
 = = Later tour matches = = 
 Seven matches remained on Bradman 's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat . Hassett was rested as Australia defeated Kent by an innings . In the next match against the Gentlemen of England at Lord 's , Hassett came to the crease at 2 / 221 after Brown was out for 121 and featured in a 110 @-@ run third @-@ wicket partnership with Bradman , who then fell for 150 . Miller came in and put on 157 with Hassett before being dismissed for 69 on the second day . Australia eventually declared at 5 / 610 when Hassett reached 200 not out against a team that featured eight Test players . Australia went on to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on . Bradman then rested himself and Hassett led Australia against Somerset . Hassett decided to bat and came to the crease when Brown was run out before Australia had scored a single run . On his 35th birthday , he made 103 and was the next batsman to fall at 2 / 256 , after a second @-@ wicket partnership with Barnes , who retired ill on 42 , and Harvey , who went on to make 126 . This ended a partnership of 187 in only 110 minutes with Harvey . Australia declared on 5 / 560 at the end of the first day . Hassett enforced the follow on as Australia went on to win by an innings and 374 runs , <unk> the hosts for 115 and 71 . Hassett made it three centuries in a row against the South of England . He came in at 2 / 49 to join Bradman and the pair added 188 for the third wicket before the captain fell for 143 with the total at 3 / 237 . Hassett then put on 175 with Harvey before the latter was out for 110 at 4 / 412 . This ended a partnership of 175 in only 110 minutes . He was eventually out for the top score of 151 while attempting a big hit , leaving the score at 6 / 446 , having anchored the tourists ’ innings . Australia declared at 7 / 522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 when rain ended the match . Hassett bowled six wicketless overs and conceded 28 runs in South 's only innings . 
 Australia 's biggest challenge in the post @-@ Test tour matches was against the H. D. G. Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI . During the last tour in 1938 , this team was effectively a full @-@ strength England outfit , but on this occasion Bradman insisted that only six current English Test players be allowed to participate . Bradman then fielded a full @-@ strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being the inclusion of Ian Johnson at the expense of Doug Ring . The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177 , and Hassett came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten seven as Australia declared at 8 / 469 . The hosts were 2 / 75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays . It was the tourists ’ last first @-@ class match for the tour and when it became obvious that they would not lose , Bradman let Hassett bowl four overs for twelve runs without taking a wicket . The tour ended with two non @-@ first @-@ class matches against Scotland . Hassett missed both of the matches ; Australia won both by an innings . 
 = = Role = = 
 Aside from being the vice @-@ captain , Hassett was one of three on @-@ tour selectors along with Bradman and Morris . As matches often started the day after the previous fixture , Australia employed a rotation policy and Hassett led the tourists in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested . Under Hassett 's watch , Australia won seven matches , five of these by an innings , while both draws were rain @-@ affected fixtures in which more than half the playing time was lost . Hassett had two close encounters as captain , both on damp pitches before the First Test . Against Yorkshire , Australia scraped home by four wickets with ten men after Sam Loxton was injured in a low @-@ scoring match . In a later game against Hampshire , Australia ceded a first innings lead for the first time on tour after a middle @-@ order collapse , but recovered to win by eight wickets . The matches against Cambridge University , Oxford University , Northamptonshire , Gloucestershire and Somerset were won by an innings . The wins over the latter two were particularly convincing ; Australia amassed its largest score for the tour against Gloucestershire , making 7 / 774 declared before winning by an innings and 363 runs . After the Tests , Australia compiled 5 / 560 against Somerset and won by an innings and 374 runs in less than two days . The matches against Durham and Glamorgan were washed out , with at least half the playing time lost . 
 A right @-@ handed batsman , Hassett played in all five Tests ; he batted in the middle @-@ order in all but the Fourth Test at Headingley , when he opened due to an injury to Sid Barnes . Aside from the Headingley Test , Hassett batted at No. 4 after Morris , Barnes and Bradman and in front of Keith Miller , except in the first innings of the series when he batted at No. 6 and made 137 . Hassett scored 310 runs at 44 @.@ 28 , placing him fourth in the Australian aggregates , but only seventh in the averages . He took six catches and did not bowl during the Tests . 
 Hassett ended the first @-@ class tour with 1 @,@ 563 runs at 74 @.@ 22 with seven first @-@ class centuries . He had the third highest aggregate behind Bradman and Morris and the second highest average . His highest score was an unbeaten 200 against the Gentlemen of England . In his 27 first @-@ class innings , Hassett batted at Nos. 3 , 4 and 5 , 21 times . Aside from the three instances in which he batted outside these positions in the Tests , Hassett made 139 while opening in the second match against Surrey in place of the injured Bill Brown , and 35 and seven not out against Worcestershire and Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI , batting at No. 7 and No. 10 <unk> An occasional medium pacer , Hassett delivered 12 overs — none in Tests — without taking a wicket . He took 23 catches , the most by an Australian ( excluding wicket @-@ keepers ) . 
 In recognition of his performances , Hassett was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949 . Wisden opined that " in addition to his playing ability Hassett 's cheerfulness and leadership , which extended to off @-@ the @-@ field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme , combined to make him an ideal vice @-@ captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman 's busy shoulders " .

 = Bert Jansch = 
 Herbert " Bert " Jansch ( 3 November 1943 – 5 October 2011 ) was a Scottish folk musician and founding member of the band Pentangle . He was born in Glasgow and came to prominence in London in the 1960s , as an acoustic guitarist , as well as a singer @-@ songwriter . He recorded at least 25 albums and toured extensively from the 1960s to the 21st century . 
 Jansch was a leading figure in the British folk music revival of the 1960s , touring folk clubs and recording several solo albums , as well as collaborating with other musicians such as John Renbourn and Anne Briggs . In 1968 , he co @-@ founded the band Pentangle , touring and recording with them until their break @-@ up in 1972 . He then took a few years ' break from music , returning in the late 1970s to work on a series of projects with other musicians . He joined a reformed Pentangle in the early 1980s and remained with them as they evolved through various changes of personnel until 1995 . Until his death , Jansch continued to work as a solo artist . 
 Jansch 's work influenced such artists as Al Stewart , Paul Simon , Johnny Marr , Elton John , Ian Anderson , Bernie Taupin , Bernard Butler , Jimmy Page , Nick Drake , Graham Coxon , Donovan , Neil Young , Fleet Foxes , Devendra Banhart , Neil Halstead , and Roy Harper . 
 Jansch received two Lifetime Achievement Awards at the BBC Folk Awards : one , in 2001 , for his solo achievements and the other , in 2007 , as a member of Pentangle . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Herbert Jansch was born at <unk> Hospital in the Springburn district of Glasgow , in 1943 , the descendant of a family originally from Hamburg , Germany , who settled in Scotland during the Victorian era . The family name is pronounced / <unk> / <unk> by almost everyone except Jansch himself . He and some close members of his family pronounce it / <unk> / <unk> . 
 Jansch was brought up in the residential area of Edinburgh known as West Pilton , where he attended Pennywell Primary School and Ainslie Park Secondary School . As a teenager , he acquired a guitar and started visiting a local folk club ( " The Howff " ) run by Roy Guest . There , he met Archie Fisher and Jill Doyle ( Davey Graham 's half @-@ sister ) , who introduced him to the music of Big Bill Broonzy , Pete Seeger , Brownie McGhee and Woody Guthrie . He also met and shared a flat with Robin Williamson , who remained a friend when Jansch later moved to London . 
 After leaving school , Jansch took a job as a nurseryman then , in August 1960 , he gave this up , intending to become a full @-@ time musician . He appointed himself as an unofficial caretaker at The Howff and , as well as sleeping there , he may have received some pay to supplement his income as a novice performer who did not own his own guitar . He spent the next two years playing one @-@ night stands in British folk clubs . This was a musical apprenticeship that exposed him to a range of influences , including Martin Carthy and Ian Campbell , but especially Anne Briggs , from whom he learned some of the songs ( such as " <unk> " and " Reynardine " ) that would later feature strongly in his recording career . 
 Between 1963 and 1965 , Jansch travelled around Europe and beyond , hitch @-@ hiking from place to place and living on earnings from busking and casual musical performances in bars and cafes . Before leaving Glasgow , he married a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl , Lynda Campbell . It was a marriage of convenience which allowed her to travel with him as she was too young to have her own passport . They split up after a few months and Jansch was eventually repatriated to Britain after catching dysentery in Tangiers . 
 = = London ( mid @-@ 1960s ) = = 
 Jansch moved to London where , in the mid @-@ 1960s , there was a burgeoning interest in folk music . There , he met the engineer and producer Bill Leader , at whose home they made a recording of Jansch 's music on a reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape recorder . Leader sold the tape for £ 100 to Transatlantic Records , who produced an album directly from it . The album Bert Jansch was released in 1965 and went on to sell 150 @,@ 000 copies . It included Jansch 's protest song " Do You Hear Me Now " which was brought to the attention of the pop music mainstream later that year by the singer Donovan , who covered it on his Universal Soldier EP , which reached No. 1 in the UK EP chart and No. 27 in the singles chart . Also included in Jansch 's first album was his song " Needle of Death " , a stark anti @-@ drugs lament written after a friend died of a heroin overdose . 
 In his early career , Jansch was sometimes characterized as a British Bob Dylan . During this period , Jansch described his musical influences as " the only three people that I 've ever copied were Big Bill Broonzy , Davy Graham and Archie Fisher " . Jansch followed his first album with two more , produced in quick succession : It Don 't Bother Me and Jack Orion — which contained his first recording of " <unk> " , later to be taken up by Jimmy Page and recorded by Led Zeppelin as " Black Mountain Side " . Jansch said : " The accompaniment was nicked by a well @-@ known member of one of the most famous rock bands , who used it , unchanged , on one of their records . " Transatlantic took legal advice about the alleged copyright infringement and were advised that there was " a distinct possibility that Bert might win an action against Page " . Ultimately , Transatlantic were dubious about the costs involved in taking on Led Zeppelin in the courts , and half the costs would have had to be paid by Jansch personally , which he simply could not afford , so the case was never pursued . The arrangement and recording of Jack Orion was greatly influenced by Jansch 's friend , singer Anne Briggs . 
 In London , Jansch met up with other innovative acoustic guitar players , including John Renbourn ( with whom he shared a flat in Kilburn ) , Davey Graham , Wizz Jones , Roy Harper and Paul Simon . They would all meet and play in various London music clubs , including the Troubadour in Old Brompton Road , and Les Cousins club in Greek Street , Soho . Renbourn and Jansch frequently played together , developing their own intricate interplay between the two guitars , often referred to as ' Folk baroque ' . 
 In 1966 , they recorded the Bert and John album together , featuring much of this material . Late in 1967 they tired of the all @-@ nighters at Les Cousins and became the resident musicians at a music venue set up by Bruce Dunnet , a Scottish entrepreneur , at the Horseshoe pub ( now defunct ) , at 264 – 267 Tottenham Court Road . This became the haunt of a number of musicians , including the singer Sandy Denny . Another singer , Jacqui McShee , began performing with the two guitarists and , with the addition of Danny Thompson ( string bass ) and Terry Cox ( drums ) , they formed the group , Pentangle . The venue evolved into a jazz club , but by then the group had moved on . 
 On 19 October 1968 , Jansch married Heather Sewell . At the time , she was an art student and had been the girlfriend of Roy Harper . She inspired several of Jansch 's songs and instrumentals : the most obvious is " Miss Heather Rosemary Sewell " , from his 1968 album Birthday Blues , but Jansch says that , despite the name , " M <unk> Nancy " ( from the 1971 Rosemary Lane album ) was also written for her . As Heather Jansch she has become a well @-@ known sculptor . 
 = = Pentangle years : 1968 – 73 = = 
 Pentangle 's first major concert was at the Royal Festival Hall in 1967 , and their first album was released in the following year . Pentangle embarked on a demanding schedule of touring the world and recording and , during this period , Jansch largely gave up solo performances . He did , however , continue to record , releasing Rosemary Lane in 1971 . The tracks for this album were recorded on a portable tape recorder by Bill Leader at Jansch 's cottage in Ticehurst , Sussex — a process which took several months , with Jansch only working when he was in the right mood . 
 Pentangle reached their highest point of commercial success with the release of their Basket of Light album in 1969 . The single , Light Flight , taken from the album became popular through its use as theme music for a TV drama series Take Three Girls for which the band also provided incidental music . In 1970 , at the peak of their popularity , they recorded a soundtrack for the film Tam Lin , made at least 12 television appearances , and undertook tours of the UK ( including the Isle of Wight Festival ) and America ( including a concert at the Carnegie Hall ) . However , their fourth album , Cruel Sister , released in October 1970 , was a commercial disaster . This was an album of traditional songs that included a 20 @-@ minute long version of Jack Orion , a song that Jansch and Renbourn had recorded previously as a duo on Jansch 's Jack Orion album . 
 Pentangle recorded two further albums , but the strains of touring and of working together as a band were taking their toll . Then Pentangle withdrew from their record company , Transatlantic , in a bitter dispute regarding royalties . The final album of the original incarnation of Pentangle was Solomon 's Seal released by Warner Brothers / Reprise in 1972 . Colin Harper describes it as " a record of people 's weariness , but also the product of a unit whose members were still among the best players , writers and musical interpreters of their day " . Pentangle split up in January 1973 , and Jansch and his wife bought a farm near Lampeter , in Wales , and withdrew temporarily from the concert circuit . 
 = = Late 1970s = = 
 After two years as a farmer , Jansch left his wife and family and returned to music ( although Jansch and his wife would not be formally divorced until 1988 ) . In 1977 , he recorded the album A Rare Conundrum with a new set of musicians : Mike Piggott , Rod Clements and Pick Withers . He then formed the band Conundrum with the addition of Martin Jenkins ( violin ) and Nigel Smith ( bass ) . They spent six months touring Australia , Japan and the United States . With the end of the tour , Conundrum parted company and Jansch spent six months in the United States , where he recorded the Heartbreak album with Albert Lee . 
 Jansch toured Scandinavia , working as a duo with Martin Jenkins and , based on ideas they developed , recorded the Avocet album ( initially released in Denmark ) . Jansch rates this as amongst his own favourites from his own recordings . On returning to England , he set up Bert Jansch 's Guitar Shop at 220 , New King 's Road , Fulham . The shop specialised in hand @-@ built acoustic guitars but was not a commercial success and closed after two years . 
 = = 1980s = = 
 In 1980 , an Italian promoter encouraged the original Pentangle to reform for a tour and a new album . The reunion started badly , with Terry Cox being injured in a car accident , resulting in the band 's debuting at the Cambridge Folk Festival as a four @-@ piece Pentangle . They managed to complete a tour of Italy ( with Cox in a wheelchair ) and Australia , before Renbourn left the band in 1983 . There then followed a series of personnel changes , including Mike Piggott replacing John Renbourn from 1983 to 1987 and recording Open the Door and In the Round , but ultimately leaving Jansch and McShee as the only original members . The final incarnation consisting of Jansch , McShee , Nigel Portman Smith ( keyboards ) , Peter Kirtley ( guitar and vocals ) and Gerry Conway ( drums ) survived from 1987 to 1995 and recorded three albums : Think of Tomorrow , One More Road and Live 1994 . As a solo artist in the mid @-@ 1980s , he often appeared on Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow @-@ Stanshall 's showboat , the Old Profanity Showboat , in Bristol 's Floating Harbour . 
 In 1985 two <unk> enigmatic limited edition albums appeared issued under the name of Loren Auerbach , who was to become his wife . ' After The Long Night ' was released in February 1985 with the second , ' Playing The Game ' appearing in October . Bert Jansch was guest player initially and also became a writer on some of the songs , arranger and co @-@ vocalist . Richard Newman was the primary guitarist and songwriter . Loren Auerbach had worked alongside Richard Newman for many years prior to meeting Bert Jansch . Newman and Jansch were the key players on ' After The Long night ' . On ' Playing The Game ' Jansch and Newman were joined with Cliff Aungier , Geoff Bradford ( lead guitarist from Cyril Davis ' All Stars , Long John Baldry 's Hoochie Coochie Men and the fist line @-@ up of The Rolling stones ) and Brian Knight ( British blues veteran of the Blues By six ) . The two albums became one - ' After The Long Night / Playing The Game ' . Bert Jansch played guitar with Richard Newman on the following Newman songs : I Can 't Go Back ; Smiling Faces ; Playing The Game ; Sorrow ; Days and Nights ; The Rainbow Man ; Frozen Beauty ; Christabel ; So Lonely ; The Miller . All songs were sung by Auerbach with the exception of ' The Miller ' that was sung by Newman . Bert married Loren Auerbach in 1999 . 
 He had always been a heavy drinker , but in 1987 he fell ill while working with Rod Clements and Marty Craggs , and was rushed to hospital , where he was told that he was " as seriously ill as you can be without dying " and that he had a choice of " giving up alcohol or simply giving up " . He chose the former option : Colin Harper states that " There can be no doubt that Bert 's creativity , reliability , energy , commitment and quality of performance were all rescued dramatically by the decision to quit boozing " . Jansch and Clements continued the work they had started before Jansch 's illness , resulting in the 1988 Leather Launderette album . 
 = = Final years and death : 1992 – 2011 = = 
 Bert was the prime mover in the Acoustic Routes film , first broadcast by the BBC in 1992 . It shows him revisiting his old haunts and reminiscing with guests such as Al Stewart , Anne Briggs , John Renbourn , and Davey Graham . 
 From 1995 , Jansch appeared frequently at the 12 Bar Club in Denmark Street , London . One of his live sets there was recorded direct to Digital Audio Tape ( DAT ) by Jansch 's then manager , Alan King , and was released as the Live at the 12 Bar : an official bootleg album in 1996 . In 2002 Jansch , Bernard Butler and Johnny " Guitar " Hodge performed live together at the Jazz Cafe , London . Bernard Butler had also appeared on Bert 's 2002 album Edge of a Dream featuring , amongst others , Ralph McTell and guitarist Paul Wassif . The instrumental " Black Cat Blues " , featuring Paul Wassif , appeared on the 2003 film Calendar Girls , and Wassif became a frequent sideman at Bert 's live shows . In 2003 , Jansch celebrated his 60th birthday with a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London . The BBC organised a concert for Jansch and various guests at the church of St Luke Old Street , which was televised on BBC Four . 
 In 2005 , Jansch teamed up again with one of his early influences , Davey Graham , for a small number of concerts in England and Scotland . His concert tour had to be postponed , owing to illness , and Jansch underwent major heart surgery in late 2005 . By 2006 he had recovered and was playing concerts again . Jansch 's album The Black Swan ( his first for four years ) was released on Sanctuary on 18 September 2006 , featuring Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart on tracks " Katie Cruel " , " When the Sun Comes Up " , and " Watch the Stars " , amongst other guests . In 2007 , he featured on Babyshambles album , Shotter 's Nation , playing acoustic guitar in the song " The Lost Art of Murder " . After recording , he accompanied Babyshambles ' lead singer Pete Doherty on several acoustic gigs , and performed on the Pete and Carl Reunion Gig , where ex @-@ Libertines and Dirty Pretty Things singer Carl Barat joined Doherty on stage . 
 In 2009 he played a concert at the London Jazz Cafe to celebrate the release of three of his older albums ( LA Turnaround , Santa Barbara Honeymoon and A Rare Conundrum ) on CD format . However , later that year , due to an unexpected illness , he had to cancel a 22 @-@ date North American tour that was due to start on 26 June . Jansch 's website reported : " Bert is very sorry to be missing the tour , and apologises to all the fans who were hoping to see him . He is looking forward to rescheduling as soon as possible . " 
 Jansch opened for Neil Young on his Twisted Road solo tour in the US and Canada , starting on 18 May 2010 . He also performed at Eric Clapton 's Crossroads festival in June 2010 . These were Jansch 's first shows since his illness . One of Bert 's last recording sessions was with Eric Clapton for Paul Wassif 's 2011 album Looking Up Feeling Down . In 2011 , a few reunion gigs took place with Pentangle , including performances at the Glastonbury Festival and one final concert at the Royal Festival Hall , London , which was also Jansch 's last ever public performance . 
 Jansch died on 5 October 2011 , aged 67 , at a hospice in Hampstead after a long battle with lung cancer . 
 He is buried in Highgate Cemetery .
