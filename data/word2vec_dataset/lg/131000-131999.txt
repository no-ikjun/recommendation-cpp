 M @-@ 186 , is a state trunkline highway in the U.S. state of Michigan . It functions as a connector highway wholly contained in Grand Traverse County , which is located in the northwestern Lower Peninsula . The western terminus is at M @-@ 113 east of Kingsley and the eastern terminus is at U.S. Highway 131 ( US 131 ) west of downtown Fife Lake . The current incarnation of M @-@ 186 is the second usage of the designation . The first was used for a highway in the Upper Peninsula in the 1930s .

 M @-@ 186 forms an easterly extension of M @-@ 113 from Kingsley to Fife Lake . M @-@ 186 starts south of a ninety @-@ degree curve in M @-@ 113 and runs east through flat , wooded terrain to Fife Lake .

 In 1940 , US 131 ended at a <unk> convergence with M @-@ 113 and M @-@ 131 four miles ( 6 km ) north of Walton Junction in Paradise Township . From this intersection , US 131 ran south to Walton Junction , M @-@ 113 ran west to Kingsley , and M @-@ 131 ran east toward Fife Lake before turning north to Petoskey . A new alignment of US 131 was built from Walton Junction directly to Fife Lake . This formed a third leg of a triangle of roads , allowing US 131 to bypass the Paradise Township intersection . US 131 replaced M @-@ 131 north from Fife Lake to Petoskey . M @-@ 113 was extended along the former section of US 131 south to Walton Junction .

 = Globular cluster = 
 A globular cluster is a spherical collection of stars that orbits a galactic core as a satellite . Globular clusters are very tightly bound by gravity , which gives them their spherical shapes and relatively high stellar densities toward their centers . The name of this category of star cluster is derived from the Latin globulus — a small sphere . A globular cluster is sometimes known more simply as a globular . 
 Globular clusters , which are found in the halo of a galaxy , contain considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense galactic , or open clusters , which are found in the disk . Globular clusters are fairly common ; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way , with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered . These globular clusters orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs ( 130 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ) or more . Larger galaxies can have more : Andromeda , for instance , may have as many as 500 . Some giant elliptical galaxies , particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters , such as M87 , have as many as 13 @,@ 000 globular clusters . 
 Every galaxy of sufficient mass in the Local Group has an associated group of globular clusters , and almost every large galaxy surveyed has been found to possess a system of globular clusters . The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters ( such as Palomar 12 ) to the Milky Way . This demonstrates how many of this galaxy 's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past . 
 Although it appears that globular clusters contain some of the first stars to be produced in the galaxy , their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear . It does appear clear that globular clusters are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy . 
 = = Observation history = = 
 The first globular cluster discovered was M22 in 1665 by Abraham <unk> , a German amateur astronomer . However , given the small aperture of early telescopes , individual stars within a globular cluster were not resolved until Charles Messier observed M4 . The first eight globular clusters discovered are shown in the table . Subsequently , Abbé Lacaille would list NGC 104 , NGC 4833 , M55 , M69 , and NGC <unk> in his 1751 – 52 catalogue . The M before a number refers to the catalogue of Charles Messier , while NGC is from the New General Catalogue by John Dreyer . 
 When William Herschel began his comprehensive survey of the sky using large telescopes in 1782 there were 34 known globular clusters . Herschel discovered another 36 himself and was the first to resolve virtually all of them into stars . He coined the term " globular cluster " in his Catalogue of a Second Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars published in 1789 . 
 The number of globular clusters discovered continued to increase , reaching 83 in 1915 , 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947 . A total of 152 globular clusters have now been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy , out of an estimated total of 180 ± 20 . These additional , undiscovered globular clusters are believed to be hidden behind the gas and dust of the Milky Way . 
 Beginning in 1914 , Harlow Shapley began a series of studies of globular clusters , published in about 40 scientific papers . He examined the RR Lyrae variables in the clusters ( which he assumed were cepheid variables ) and would use their period – luminosity relationship for distance estimates . Later , it was found that RR Lyrae variables are fainter than cepheid variables , which caused Shapley to overestimate the distance to the clusters . 
 Of the globular clusters within the Milky Way , the majority are found in the vicinity of the galactic core , and the large majority lie on the side of the celestial sky centered on the core . In 1918 , this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Harlow Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy . By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of globular clusters around the galaxy 's center , he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the sun relative to the galactic center . While his distance estimate was in significant error , it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought . His error was because dust in the Milky Way diminished the amount of light from a globular cluster that reached the earth , thus making it appear farther away . Shapley 's estimate was , however , within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value . 
 Shapley 's measurements also indicated that the Sun was relatively far from the center of the galaxy , contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars . In reality , ordinary stars lie within the galaxy 's disk and are thus often obscured by gas and dust , whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances . 
 = = = Classification of <unk> = = = 
 Shapley was subsequently assisted in his studies of clusters by Henrietta Swope and Helen Battles Sawyer ( later Hogg ) . In 1927 – 29 , Harlow Shapley and Helen Sawyer began categorizing clusters according to the degree of concentration the system has toward the core . The most concentrated clusters were identified as Class I , with successively diminishing concentrations ranging to Class XII . This became known as the Shapley – Sawyer Concentration Class ( it is sometimes given with numbers [ Class 1 – 12 ] rather than Roman numerals . ) In 2015 , a new type of globular cluster was proposed on the basis of observational data , the dark globular clusters . 
 = = Formation = = 
 The formation of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon and it remains uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations over a period of several hundred million years . In many globular clusters , most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution , suggesting that they formed at about the same time . However , the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster , with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars . An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) that exhibit a bimodal population . During their youth , these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation . This star @-@ forming period is relatively brief , compared to the age of many globular clusters . It has also been proposed that the reason for this multiplicity in stellar populations could have a dynamical origin . In the Antennae galaxy , for example , the Hubble Space Telescope has observed clusters of clusters , regions in the galaxy that span hundreds of parsecs , where many of the clusters will eventually collide and merge . Many of them present a significant range in ages , hence possibly metallicities , and their merger could plausibly lead to clusters with a bimodal or even multiple distribution of populations . 
 Observations of globular clusters show that these stellar formations arise primarily in regions of efficient star formation , and where the interstellar medium is at a higher density than in normal star @-@ forming regions . Globular cluster formation is prevalent in starburst regions and in interacting galaxies . Research indicates a correlation between the mass of a central supermassive black holes ( SMBH ) and the extent of the globular cluster systems of elliptical and lenticular galaxies . The mass of the SMBH in such a galaxy is often close to the combined mass of the galaxy 's globular clusters . 
 No known globular clusters display active star formation , which is consistent with the view that globular clusters are typically the oldest objects in the Galaxy , and were among the first collections of stars to form . Very large regions of star formation known as super star clusters , such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way , may be the precursors of globular clusters . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Globular clusters are generally composed of hundreds of thousands of low @-@ metal , old stars . The type of stars found in a globular cluster are similar to those in the bulge of a spiral galaxy but confined to a volume of only a few million cubic parsecs . They are free of gas and dust and it is presumed that all of the gas and dust was long ago turned into stars . 
 Globular clusters can contain a high density of stars ; on average about 0 @.@ 4 stars per cubic parsec , increasing to 100 or 1000 stars per cubic parsec in the core of the cluster . The typical distance between stars in a globular cluster is about 1 light year , but at its core , the separation is comparable to the size of the Solar System ( 100 to 1000 times closer than stars near the Solar System ) . 
 However , they are not thought to be favorable locations for the survival of planetary systems . Planetary orbits are dynamically unstable within the cores of dense clusters because of the perturbations of passing stars . A planet orbiting at 1 astronomical unit around a star that is within the core of a dense cluster such as 47 Tucanae would only survive on the order of 108 years . There is a planetary system orbiting a pulsar ( PSR B1620 − 26 ) that belongs to the globular cluster M4 , but these planets likely formed after the event that created the pulsar . 
 Some globular clusters , like Omega Centauri in the Milky Way and G1 in M31 , are extraordinarily massive , with several million solar masses ( M ☉ ) and multiple stellar populations . Both can be regarded as evidence that supermassive globular clusters are in fact the cores of dwarf galaxies that are consumed by the larger galaxies . About a quarter of the globular cluster population in the Milky Way may have been accreted along with their host dwarf galaxy . 
 Several globular clusters ( like M15 ) have extremely massive cores which may harbor black holes , although simulations suggest that a less massive black hole or central concentration of neutron stars or massive white dwarfs explain observations equally well . 
 = = = Metallic content = = = 
 Globular clusters normally consist of Population II stars , which have a low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun . Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity . These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium , where they enter the next generation of stars . Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star , with older stars typically having a lower metallicity . 
 The Dutch astronomer Pieter Oosterhoff noticed that there appear to be two populations of globular clusters , which became known as Oosterhoff groups . The second group has a slightly longer period of RR Lyrae variable stars . Both groups have weak lines of metallic elements . But the lines in the stars of Oosterhoff type I ( <unk> ) cluster are not quite as weak as those in type II ( <unk> ) . Hence type I are referred to as " metal @-@ rich " ( e.g. <unk> 7 ) while type II are " metal @-@ poor " ( e.g. ESO 280 @-@ <unk> ) . 
 These two populations have been observed in many galaxies , especially massive elliptical galaxies . Both groups are nearly as old as the universe itself and are of similar ages , but differ in their metal abundances . Many scenarios have been suggested to explain these subpopulations , including violent gas @-@ rich galaxy mergers , the accretion of dwarf galaxies , and multiple phases of star formation in a single galaxy . In the Milky Way , the metal @-@ poor clusters are associated with the halo and the metal @-@ rich clusters with the bulge . 
 In the Milky Way it has been discovered that the large majority of the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy 's halo . This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy , rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way 's globular cluster system as had been previously thought . The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems . 
 = = = Exotic components = = = 
 Globular clusters have a very high star density , and therefore close interactions and near @-@ collisions of stars occur relatively often . Due to these chance encounters , some exotic classes of stars , such as blue stragglers , millisecond pulsars and low @-@ mass X @-@ ray binaries , are much more common in globular clusters . A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars , possibly as a result of an encounter with a binary system . The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity , and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster . 
 Astronomers have searched for black holes within globular clusters since the 1970s . The resolution requirements for this task , however , are exacting , and it is only with the Hubble space telescope that the first confirmed discoveries have been made . In independent programs , a 4 @,@ 000 M ☉ intermediate @-@ mass black hole has been suggested to exist based on HST observations in the globular cluster M15 and a 20 @,@ 000 M ☉ black hole in the Mayall II cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy . Both x @-@ ray and radio emissions from Mayall II appear to be consistent with an intermediate @-@ mass black hole . 
 These are of particular interest because they are the first black holes discovered that were intermediate in mass between the conventional stellar @-@ mass black hole and the supermassive black holes discovered at the cores of galaxies . The mass of these intermediate mass black holes is proportional to the mass of the clusters , following a pattern previously discovered between supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies . 
 Claims of intermediate mass black holes have been met with some skepticism . The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation . As pointed out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators , the mass @-@ to @-@ light ratio should rise sharply towards the center of the cluster , even without a black hole , in both M15 and Mayall II . 
 = = Color @-@ magnitude diagram = = 
 The Hertzsprung @-@ Russell diagram ( HR @-@ diagram ) is a graph of a large sample of stars that plots their visual absolute magnitude against their color index . The color index , B − V , is the difference between the magnitude of the star in blue light , or B , and the magnitude in visual light ( green @-@ yellow ) , or V. Large positive values indicate a red star with a cool surface temperature , while negative values imply a blue star with a hotter surface . 
 When the stars near the Sun are plotted on an HR diagram , it displays a distribution of stars of various masses , ages , and compositions . Many of the stars lie relatively close to a sloping curve with increasing absolute magnitude as the stars are hotter , known as main @-@ sequence stars . However the diagram also typically includes stars that are in later stages of their evolution and have wandered away from this main @-@ sequence curve . 
 As all the stars of a globular cluster are at approximately the same distance from us , their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount . The main @-@ sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that is believed to be comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood . The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short @-@ period variables , such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables , with those in the cluster . 
 By matching up these curves on the HR diagram the absolute magnitude of main @-@ sequence stars in the cluster can also be determined . This in turn provides a distance estimate to the cluster , based on the visual magnitude of the stars . The difference between the relative and absolute magnitude , the distance modulus , yields this estimate of the distance . 
 When the stars of a particular globular cluster are plotted on an HR diagram , in many cases nearly all of the stars fall upon a relatively well defined curve . This differs from the HR diagram of stars near the Sun , which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins . The shape of the curve for a globular cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials , differing only in their initial mass . As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age , the shape of the curve for a globular cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population . 
 However , the above @-@ mentioned historic process of determining the age and distance to globular clusters is not as robust as first thought , since the morphology and luminosity of globular cluster stars in color @-@ magnitude diagrams are influenced by numerous parameters , many of which are still being actively researched . Certain clusters even display populations that are absent from other globular clusters ( e.g. , blue hook stars ) , or feature multiple populations . The historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time , or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance , has likewise been overturned ( e.g. , NGC 2808 ) . Further , the morphology of the cluster stars in a color @-@ magnitude diagram , and that includes the brightnesses of distance indicators such as RR Lyrae variable members , can be influenced by observational biases . One such effect is called blending , and it arises because the cores of globular clusters are so dense that in low @-@ resolution observations multiple ( unresolved ) stars may appear as a single target . Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star ( e.g. , an RR Lyrae variable ) is erroneously too bright , given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined . Consequently , the computed distance is wrong , and more importantly , certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder , and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the Hubble constant . 
 The most massive main @-@ sequence stars will also have the highest absolute magnitude , and these will be the first to evolve into the giant star stage . As the cluster ages , stars of successively lower masses will also enter the giant star stage . Thus the age of a single population cluster can be measured by looking for the stars that are just beginning to enter the giant star stage . This forms a " knee " in the HR diagram , bending to the upper right from the main @-@ sequence line . The absolute magnitude at this bend is directly a function of the age of globular cluster , so an age scale can be plotted on an axis parallel to the magnitude . 
 In addition , globular clusters can be dated by looking at the temperatures of the coolest white dwarfs . Typical results for globular clusters are that they may be as old as 12 @.@ 7 billion years . This is in contrast to open clusters which are only tens of millions of years old . 
 The ages of globular clusters place a bound on the age limit of the entire universe . This lower limit has been a significant constraint in cosmology . Historically , astronomers were faced with age estimates of globular clusters that appeared older than cosmological models would allow . However , better measurements of cosmological parameters through deep sky surveys and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope appear to have resolved this issue . 
 Evolutionary studies of globular clusters can also be used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster . That is , the evolutionary tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements . The data obtained from studies of globular clusters are then used to study the evolution of the Milky Way as a whole . 
 In globular clusters a few stars known as blue stragglers are observed , apparently continuing the main sequence in the direction of brighter , bluer stars . The origins of these stars is still unclear , but most models suggest that these stars are the result of mass transfer in multiple star systems . 
 = = Morphology = = 
 In contrast to open clusters , most globular clusters remain gravitationally bound for time periods comparable to the life spans of the majority of their stars . However , a possible exception is when strong tidal interactions with other large masses result in the dispersal of the stars . 
 After they are formed , the stars in the globular cluster begin to interact gravitationally with each other . As a result , the velocity vectors of the stars are steadily modified , and the stars lose any history of their original velocity . The characteristic interval for this to occur is the relaxation time . This is related to the characteristic length of time a star needs to cross the cluster as well as the number of stellar masses in the system . The value of the relaxation time varies by cluster , but the mean value is on the order of 109 years . 
 Although globular clusters generally appear spherical in form , <unk> can occur due to tidal interactions . Clusters within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are typically oblate spheroids in shape , while those in the Large Magellanic Cloud are more elliptical . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Astronomers characterize the morphology of a globular cluster by means of standard radii . These are the core radius ( rc ) , the half @-@ light radius ( rh ) , and the tidal ( or Jacobi ) radius ( rt ) . The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core , and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half . A comparable quantity is the half @-@ light radius , or the distance from the core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received . This is typically larger than the core radius . 
 Note that the half @-@ light radius includes stars in the outer part of the cluster that happen to lie along the line of sight , so theorists will also use the half @-@ mass radius ( rm ) — the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster . When the half @-@ mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the overall size , it has a dense core . An example of this is Messier 3 ( M3 ) , which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes , but a half @-@ mass radius of only 1 @.@ 12 arc minutes . 
 Almost all globular clusters have a half @-@ light radius of less than 10 pc , although there are well @-@ established globular clusters with very large radii ( i.e. NGC 2419 ( Rh 
 = 18 pc ) and Palomar 14 ( Rh = 
 25 pc ) ) . 
 Finally the tidal radius , or Hill sphere , is the distance from the center of the globular cluster at which the external gravitation of the galaxy has more influence over the stars in the cluster than does the cluster itself . This is the distance at which the individual stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy . The tidal radius of M3 is about 40 arc minutes , or about 113 pc at the distance of 10 @.@ 4 kpc . 
 = = = Mass segregation , luminosity and core collapse = = = 
 In measuring the luminosity curve of a given globular cluster as a function of distance from the core , most clusters in the Milky Way increase steadily in luminosity as this distance decreases , up to a certain distance from the core , then the luminosity levels off . Typically this distance is about 1 – 2 parsecs from the core . However about 20 % of the globular clusters have undergone a process termed " core collapse " . In this type of cluster , the luminosity continues to increase steadily all the way to the core region . An example of a core @-@ collapsed globular is M15 . 
 Core @-@ collapse is thought to occur when the more massive stars in a globular cluster encounter their less massive companions . Over time , dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate from the center of the cluster to the outside . This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region , leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume . When this <unk> instability occurs , the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power @-@ law cusp . ( Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution ; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp . ) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core , a phenomenon called mass segregation . 
 The dynamical heating effect of binary star systems works to prevent an initial core collapse of the cluster . When a star passes near a binary system , the orbit of the latter pair tends to contract , releasing energy . Only after the primordial supply of binaries is exhausted due to interactions can a deeper core collapse proceed . In contrast , the effect of tidal shocks as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a spiral galaxy tends to significantly accelerate core collapse . 
 The different stages of core @-@ collapse may be divided into three phases . During a globular cluster 's adolescence , the process of core @-@ collapse begins with stars near the core . However , the interactions between binary star systems prevents further collapse as the cluster approaches middle age . Finally , the central binaries are either disrupted or ejected , resulting in a tighter concentration at the core . 
 The interaction of stars in the collapsed core region causes tight binary systems to form . As other stars interact with these tight binaries , they increase the energy at the core , which causes the cluster to re @-@ expand . As the mean time for a core collapse is typically less than the age of the galaxy , many of a galaxy 's globular clusters may have passed through a core collapse stage , then re @-@ expanded . 
 The Hubble Space Telescope has been used to provide convincing observational evidence of this stellar mass @-@ sorting process in globular clusters . Heavier stars slow down and crowd at the cluster 's core , while lighter stars pick up speed and tend to spend more time at the cluster 's periphery . The globular star cluster 47 Tucanae , which is made up of about 1 million stars , is one of the densest globular clusters in the Southern Hemisphere . This cluster was subjected to an intensive photographic survey , which allowed astronomers to track the motion of its stars . Precise velocities were obtained for nearly 15 @,@ 000 stars in this cluster . 
 A 2008 study by John <unk> of 13 globular clusters in the Milky Way shows that three of them have an unusually large number of X @-@ ray sources , or X @-@ ray binaries , suggesting the clusters are middle @-@ aged . Previously , these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers , another test of age used by astronomers . The implication is that most globular clusters , including the other ten studied by <unk> , are not in middle age as previously thought , but are actually in ' adolescence ' . 
 The overall luminosities of the globular clusters within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy can be modeled by means of a gaussian curve . This gaussian can be represented by means of an average magnitude Mv and a variance <unk> . This distribution of globular cluster luminosities is called the Globular Cluster Luminosity Function ( <unk> ) . ( For the Milky Way , Mv 
 = − 7 @.@ 20 ± 0 @.@ 13 , σ = 
 1 @.@ 1 ± 0 @.@ 1 magnitudes . ) The <unk> has also been used as a " standard candle " for measuring the distance to other galaxies , under the assumption that the globular clusters in remote galaxies follow the same principles as they do in the Milky Way . 
 = = = N @-@ body simulations = = = 
 Computing the interactions between the stars within a globular cluster requires solving what is termed the N @-@ body problem . That is , each of the stars within the cluster continually interacts with the other N − 1 stars , where N is the total number of stars in the cluster . The naive CPU computational " cost " for a dynamic simulation increases in proportion to N 2 ( each of N objects must interact pairwise with each of the other N objects ) , so the potential computing requirements to accurately simulate such a cluster can be enormous . An efficient method of mathematically simulating the N @-@ body dynamics of a globular cluster is done by subdividing into small volumes and velocity ranges , and using probabilities to describe the locations of the stars . The motions are then described by means of a formula called the Fokker – Planck equation . This can be solved by a simplified form of the equation , or by running Monte Carlo simulations and using random values . However the simulation becomes more difficult when the effects of binaries and the interaction with external gravitation forces ( such as from the Milky Way galaxy ) must also be included . 
 The results of N @-@ body simulations have shown that the stars can follow unusual paths through the cluster , often forming loops and often falling more directly toward the core than would a single star orbiting a central mass . In addition , due to interactions with other stars that result in an increase in velocity , some of the stars gain sufficient energy to escape the cluster . Over long periods of time this will result in a dissipation of the cluster , a process termed evaporation . The typical time scale for the evaporation of a globular cluster is 1010 years . In 2010 it became possible to directly compute , star by star , N @-@ body simulations of a globular cluster over the course of its lifetime . 
 Binary stars form a significant portion of the total population of stellar systems , with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems . Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters . When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system , a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star . When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process , it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse . 
 The ultimate fate of a globular cluster must be either to accrete stars at its core , causing its steady contraction , or gradual shedding of stars from its outer layers . 
 = = = Intermediate forms = = = 
 The distinction between cluster types is not always clear @-@ cut , and objects have been found that blur the lines between the categories . For example , BH 176 in the southern part of the Milky Way has properties of both an open and a globular cluster . 
 In 2005 , astronomers discovered a completely new type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy , which is , in several ways , very similar to globular clusters . The new @-@ found clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars , a similar number to that found in globular clusters . The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity . What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light @-@ years across – and hundreds of times less dense . The distances between the stars are , therefore , much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters . <unk> , these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy . 
 How these clusters are formed is not yet known , but their formation might well be related to that of globular clusters . Why M31 has such clusters , while the Milky Way does not , is not yet known . It is also unknown if any other galaxy contains these types of clusters , but it would be very unlikely that M31 is the sole galaxy with extended clusters . 
 = = Tidal encounters = = 
 When a globular cluster has a close encounter with a large mass , such as the core region of a galaxy , it undergoes a tidal interaction . The difference in the pull of gravity between the part of the cluster nearest the mass and the pull on the furthest part of the cluster results in a tidal force . A " tidal shock " occurs whenever the orbit of a cluster takes it through the plane of a galaxy . 
 As a result of a tidal shock , streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo , leaving only the core part of the cluster . These tidal interaction effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster . These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit . The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster , and can form <unk> features . 
 The globular cluster Palomar 5 , for example , is near the <unk> point of its orbit after passing through the Milky Way . Streams of stars extend outward toward the front and rear of the orbital path of this cluster , stretching out to distances of 13 @,@ 000 light @-@ years . Tidal interactions have stripped away much of the mass from Palomar 5 , and further interactions as it passes through the galactic core are expected to transform it into a long stream of stars orbiting the Milky Way halo . 
 Tidal interactions add kinetic energy into a globular cluster , dramatically increasing the evaporation rate and shrinking the size of the cluster . Not only does tidal shock strip off the outer stars from a globular cluster , but the increased evaporation accelerates the process of core collapse . The same physical mechanism may be at work in dwarf spheroidal galaxies such as the Sagittarius Dwarf , which appears to be undergoing tidal disruption due to its proximity to the Milky Way .

 There are many globular clusters with a retrograde orbit round the Milky Way Galaxy . A hypervelocity globular cluster was discovered around Messier 87 in 2014 , having a velocity in excess of the escape velocity of M87 .

 Astronomers are searching for exoplanets of stars in globular star clusters . 
 In 2000 , the results of a search for giant planets in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae were announced . The lack of any successful discoveries suggests that the abundance of elements ( other than hydrogen or helium ) necessary to build these planets may need to be at least 40 % of the abundance in the Sun . Terrestrial planets are built from heavier elements such as silicon , iron and magnesium . The very low abundance of these elements in globular clusters means that the member stars have a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth @-@ mass planets , when compared to stars in the neighborhood of the Sun . Hence the halo region of the Milky Way galaxy , including globular cluster members , are unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets . 
 In spite of the lower likelihood of giant planet formation , just such an object has been found in the globular cluster Messier 4 . This planet was detected orbiting a pulsar in the binary star system PSR B1620 @-@ 26 . The eccentric and highly inclined orbit of the planet suggests it may have been formed around another star in the cluster , then was later " exchanged " into its current arrangement . The likelihood of close encounters between stars in a globular cluster can disrupt planetary systems , some of which break loose to become free floating planets . Even close orbiting planets can become disrupted , potentially leading to orbital decay and an increase in orbital eccentricity and tidal effects .

 = Hapalopilus nidulans = 
 Hapalopilus nidulans ( also known as Hapalopilus rutilans ) is a species of polypore fungus in the family Polyporaceae . Officially described in 1821 , it was transferred to its current genus Hapalopilus six decades later . It is commonly known as the tender nesting polypore , purple dye polypore , or the cinnamon bracket . This widely distributed species is found on five continents . It grows on the fallen or standing dead wood of deciduous trees , in which it fruits singly , in groups , fused , or in overlapping clusters . Fruit bodies are in the form of kidney @-@ shaped to semicircular , cinnamon @-@ orange @-@ brown brackets . The underside of the fruit body features a yellowish to brownish pore surface with tiny angular pores , from which spores are released . 
 The poisonous fruit bodies cause neurotoxic symptoms if ingested , an effect attributable to the compound <unk> acid , which is present in high concentrations . When an alkaline solution is placed on the fungus , the flesh turns violet . The fungus is used in mushroom dyeing to produce purple colors . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described in 1791 by French mycologist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard , who called it Boletus <unk> . However , this name had been used previously by Carl Linnaeus ( for a species now known as Polyporus <unk> ) , and so Bulliard 's name was an illegitimate homonym . In 1821 , Elias Magnus Fries published the species as Polyporus nidulans . In 1881 , Petter Karsten transferred it to its current genus , Hapalopilus , as the type species . The fungus has been shuffled to several genera throughout its taxonomic history , including Boletus ( Kurt Sprengel , 1827 ) , Inonotus ( Petter Karsten , 1881 ) , Phaeolus ( Narcisse Théophile Patouillard , 1900 ) , <unk> ( François @-@ Xavier <unk> and Jean Louis <unk> , 1890 ) , and Agaricus ( Ernst Hans Ludwig Krause , 1933 ) . 
 The name Boletus rutilans , published by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1798 , and later transferred to Hapalopilus by William Alphonso Murrill in 1904 , is a synonym that is still used in several recent sources . Murrill noted , " When Fries studied the plant he gave it the name P. nidulans , following it with Persoon 's P. rutilans , which , he naively remarked , was perhaps a variety of P. nidulans . The two species were kept distinct by Berkeley , but he had little and poor material and evidently did not know them intimately . " According to MycoBank , although the name Boletus rutilans was sanctioned by Fries in his 1818 book Observationes <unk> , his remarks in the text suggest that he recognized the species were the same , and subsequently the name was not sanctioned against P. nidulans . According to Field Museum mycologist Patrick Leacock , however , Fries ( 1818 ) was not a sanctioning work , although both names were sanctioned later by Fries in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum . Since both names are sanctioned , and the basionym for H. rutilans was published earlier ( in 1798 ) , Leacock suggests this name should take priority . As of November 2015 , both MycoBank and Species Fungorum give H. rutilans and H. nidulans as synonymous , with the latter being the preferred name . 
 The polypore is commonly known as the " purple dye polypore " , " cinnamon bracket " , or the " tender nesting polypore " . The specific epithet nidulans is Latin for " nesting " ; the epithet rutilans means " orange @-@ red " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is fan @-@ shaped to semicircular and convex , reaching a diameter of 2 @.@ 5 – 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) . It lacks a stalk , and is instead attached broadly to the substrate . The fruit bodies are initially soft and spongy , but become hard and brittle once they have lost their moisture . The cap surface is covered with matted hairs , has shallow concentric furrows , and a dull brownish @-@ orange color . The flesh is up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick at the thickest part , and is a pale cinnamon color . The pore surface is yellowish to brownish , and the pores are angular , numbering about 2 – 4 per millimeter . In young fruit bodies , the pore surface bruises reddish brown . The mushroom 's odor and taste ranges from sweetish to indistinct . 
 Fruit bodies produce a white spore print . Spores are elliptical to cylindrical , smooth , hyaline ( translucent ) , and measure 3 @.@ 5 – 5 by 2 – 3 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club shaped and four @-@ spored , with dimensions of 18 – 22 by 5 – 5 @.@ 6 μm . H. nidulans has a monomitic hyphal system , containing only generative hyphae with clamp connections . In the flesh , these hyphae are thick @-@ walled and highly branched , measuring up to 10 μm in diameter ; hyphae comprising the pores and the subhymenium are thinner ( up to 6 μm wide ) and less branched . A chemical test can be used to help identify H. nidulans : all parts of the fruit body will instantly stain bright violet if a drop of an alkaline solution is applied . Dilute ( 3 – 10 % ) potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) , is often used for this purpose . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Some other polypores are roughly similar in appearance to H. nidulans and might be confused with it . Phellinus gilvus has a yellowish to rusty @-@ yellow fibrous cap , yellowish @-@ brown flesh that stains black in KOH , and a grayish @-@ brown to dark brown pore surface . Hapalopilus croceus produces large fruit bodies with caps up to 20 @.@ 5 cm ( 8 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter . Its pore surface is bright reddish orange when fresh , and its flesh stains red with KOH . <unk> cinnabarinus has a tougher fruit body and is a brighter red color . The edible " beefsteak fungus " Fistulina hepatica may readily be confused with H. nidulans . It has soft , blood @-@ red fruit bodies that ooze red juice . Also edible , the " chicken of the woods " , <unk> sulphureus , has bright yellow fruit bodies whose color fades in age . 
 = = Habitat , distribution , and ecology = = 
 A saprobic species , Hapalopilus nidulans causes a white rot in its host . Fruit bodies of the fungus grow singly , in groups , or in fused and overlapping clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees . Preferred hosts include Quercus ( oak ) , Fagus ( beech ) , and Betula ( birch ) , although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well . In central Europe , its preferred host is oak , while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus . Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn , but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season . 
 Hapalopilus nidulans has a mostly circumboreal distribution in the north temperate zone , and has been found in North Africa , Asia , Europe , and North America . Outside of this region , it has been recorded from Australia , and Oceania . In North America , where it can be found as far north as the Northwest Territories in Canada , it is more common in the eastern and southwestern part of the continent . In Europe , its northern distribution extends to Porsanger in Norway . Reported for the first time from India in 2011 , it was found in forests depots of Chhattisgarh , growing on the stored logs of several native trees : <unk> latifolia , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Shorea robusta , and Terminalia <unk> . 
 Fungus beetle species known to inhabit and rear their young in the fruit bodies of Hapalopilus nidulans include <unk> affinis , <unk> axillaris , H. <unk> , and <unk> fasciata . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The fruit bodies of H. nidulans are inedible . They have been reported to have neurotoxic effects attributable to <unk> acid , a terphenyl compound first identified from a mycelial culture of the fungus in 1877 . This chemical , present at 20 – 40 % of the dry weight of the fruit bodies , inhibits the enzyme <unk> dehydrogenase . It is found in other mushrooms , but in much lower amounts . In a poisoning case reported in 1992 , one German family who consumed H. nidulans experienced nausea , impaired movement , visual impairment , liver and kidney failure ; symptoms began about 12 hours after consuming the mushroom . Additionally , the urine of all three poisoning victims temporarily turned violet . They recovered fully a week later . Similar symptoms and recovery were reported in a 2013 poisoning case , in which the fungus was confused with the edible Fistulina hepatica . The set of symptoms arising from consumption of H. nidulans has been called the neurotoxic delayed syndrome . 
 Hapalopilus nidulans is highly appreciated by those who make mushroom dyes . When used in combination with alkaline fixatives , the fruit bodies can produce striking violet colors .

 Alexander Cameron Rutherford , KC ( February 2 , 1857 – June 11 , 1941 ) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the first Premier of Alberta from 1905 to 1910 . Born in Ormond , Ontario , he studied and practised law in Ottawa before moving with his family to the Northwest Territories in 1895 . Here he began his political career , winning in his third attempt a seat in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories . In keeping with the territorial custom Rutherford ran as an independent , though he generally supported the territorial administration of Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain . At the federal level , however , Rutherford was a Liberal . 
 In 1905 , Alberta Lieutenant Governor George Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the new province 's first government . As Premier , his first task was to win a workable majority in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta , which he did in the 1905 provincial election . His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government : his government established everything from speed limits to a provincial court system . The legislature also controversially , and with Rutherford 's support , selected Edmonton over rival Calgary as the provincial capital . Calgarians ' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the University of Alberta , a project dear to the Premier 's heart , in his hometown of Strathcona , just across the North Saskatchewan River from Edmonton . 
 The government was faced with labour unrest in the coal mining industry , which it resolved by establishing a commission to examine the problem . It also set up a provincial government telephone network — Alberta Government Telephones — at great expense , and tried to encourage the development of new railways . It was in pursuit of this last objective that the Rutherford government found itself embroiled in scandal . Early in 1910 , William Henry Cushing 's resignation as Minister of Public Works precipitated the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal , which turned many of Rutherford 's Liberals against his government . Eventually , pressure from many party figures forced Rutherford to resign . He kept his seat in the legislature after resigning as premier , but was defeated in the 1913 election by Conservative Herbert Crawford . 
 After leaving politics , Rutherford continued his law practice and his involvement with a wide range of community groups . Most importantly , he became chancellor of the University of Alberta , whose earlier founding had been a personal project . He died of a heart attack June 11 , 1941 . A University of Alberta library , an Edmonton elementary school , and Jasper National Park 's Mount Rutherford are named in his honour . Additionally , his home , Rutherford House , was opened as a museum in 1973 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Alexander Rutherford was born February 2 , 1857 , near Ormond , Ontario on his family 's dairy farm . His parents , James ( 1817 – 1891 ) and <unk> " Elizabeth " ( 1818 – 1901 ) Cameron Rutherford , had immigrated from Scotland two years previous . They joined the Baptist Church , and his father joined the Liberal Party of Canada and served for a time on the Osgoode village council . Rutherford attended public school locally and , after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation , enrolled in a Metcalfe high school . After graduating in 1874 , he attended the Canadian Literary Institute , a Baptist college in Woodstock . He graduated from there in 1876 , and taught for a year in Osgoode . 
 Next he moved to Montreal to study arts and law at McGill University . He was awarded degrees in both in 1881 , and joined the Ottawa law firm of Scott , McTavish and McCracken where he was articled for four years under the tutelage of Richard William Scott . Called to the Ontario bar in 1885 , he became a junior partner in the firm of Hodgins , Kidd and Rutherford with responsibility for its Kemptville office for ten years . He also established a moneylending business there . 
 During this time , his social circle grew to include William Cameron Edwards . Through Edwards , Rutherford was introduced to the Birkett family , which included former Member of Parliament Thomas Birkett . Rutherford married Birkett 's niece , Mattie Birkett , in December 1888 . The couple had three children : Cecil ( born in 1890 ) , Hazel ( born in 1893 ) , and Marjorie ( born in 1903 , but died sixteen months later ) . Rutherford had a traditional view of gender roles , and was happy to leave most child @-@ rearing responsibilities to his wife . 
 = = = Move west = = = 
 In November 1886 Rutherford visited the Canadian West for the first time when he travelled to British Columbia to investigate the disappearance of his cousin . The Rocky Mountains left a great impression on him , as did the coastal climate which he found " very agreeable " . He visited again in the summer of 1894 , when he took the Canadian Pacific Railway across the prairies . Upon arriving in South Edmonton , he was excited by its growth potential and pleased to find that the dry air relieved his bronchitis . He resolved to settle there , and did so one year later , bringing his reluctant wife and his children , who arrived by train June 10 , 1895 . Within ten days of their arrival , Rutherford had opened a law office , purchased four lots of land , and contracted local builder Hugh McCurdy to build him a house . In July the family moved into their new four @-@ room house , built on a single storey . In 1896 Rutherford became the town 's only lawyer , as his competition , Mervyn Mackenzie , had moved to Toronto . 
 Rutherford quickly became deeply involved in the community . Among the roles he acquired during his first three years in the District of Alberta were President of the newly formed South Edmonton Football Club , secretary @-@ treasurer of the South Edmonton School Board , president of the South Edmonton Athletic Association , vice president of the South Edmonton Literary Institute , auditor of the South Edmonton Agricultural Society , and worthy master of the Acacia Lodge , Ancient Free and Accepted Masons . He later added to this the title of secretary of the Edmonton District Butter and Cheese Manufacturing Association . He was an early advocate for the incorporation of South Edmonton , hitherto an unincorporated community . When incorporation came in 1899 — as the Town of Strathcona — Rutherford became the new town 's secretary @-@ treasurer ( after acting as returning officer in its first election ) . 
 Throughout this period , he practised law , from 1899 with Frederick C. Jamieson as his partner , who later was elected as a Conservative member of the MLA . He employed single women as secretaries in an era when clerical workers were predominantly male , and defended a First Nations person accused of murder , at a time when most lawyers refused such cases . As their practice grew , he and Jamieson also engaged in moneylending . Besides his law practice , Rutherford was a successful real estate investor , and also owned an interest in gold mining equipment situated on the North Saskatchewan River . 
 = = = Early political career = = = 
 In 1896 , Frank Oliver , who had represented Edmonton in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories since 1888 , resigned to pursue a career in federal politics . Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver 's old seat in the ensuing by @-@ election . Though he was originally reluctant , he agreed to stand after a 300 @-@ signature petition urging his candidacy was presented to him . His only opponent was former Edmonton mayor Matthew McCauley who , like Rutherford , ran as an independent . Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads , resource development , simplification of territorial ordinances , and — in what would become a theme of his political career — increased educational funding . McCauley won the election , but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote . 
 During the 1898 territorial election , Rutherford again challenged the now @-@ incumbent McCauley . His defeat of two years previous still fresh in his mind , his platform this time included a call for a redrawing of the territory 's electoral boundaries ; he believed that the current Edmonton riding was gerrymandered in McCauley 's favour . He also repeated his past calls for improved roads and advocated increased taxation on the railroads . He pledged " independent support " for the non @-@ partisan administration of Premier Frederick Haultain , and supported that administration 's call for the creation of a single province from the territories following the 1901 census . Rutherford criticized McCauley 's past record , accusing him of silence on issues that were of concern to his constituents . Despite this , McCauley won again , albeit by a reduced margin . 
 Rutherford was at last successful in the 1902 election , when he ran in the newly created riding of Strathcona . His 1902 platform was similar to his 1898 platform and supported Haultain , though this time he supported a two @-@ province integration of the Northwest Territories into Confederation , rather than Haultain 's preferred one @-@ province approach , on the grounds that a single province would be so large as to be ungovernable . It at first looked as though he would run unopposed ; however , at the last minute local lawyer Nelson D. Mills publicly accused Rutherford of being not a true independent , but a dyed @-@ in @-@ the @-@ wool Haultain supporter , and announced that he would run against him . Rutherford was supported by most of Strathcona 's most prominent residents , including his law partner Jamieson and his future rival John R. Boyle , and won an easy victory . 
 Rutherford served in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a province in 1905 . During his tenure , he was elected deputy speaker and sat on standing committees for libraries , municipal law , and education . His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend the boundaries of the Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works . He was considered a possible member of Haultain 's executive council , likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works , but the post instead went to George Bulyea . He joined many of his fellow MLAs in continuing to advocate for provincial status , finding that the limitations on a territory 's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations . 
 Though Rutherford supported Haultain 's vision of non @-@ partisan territorial administration , federally he was an avowed Liberal . In 1900 , he was elected president of the Strathcona Liberal association , and was a delegate to the convention that nominated Oliver as the party 's candidate in Alberta for the 1900 federal election . He subsequently campaigned for Oliver in his successful re @-@ election attempt . When the new federal constituency of Strathcona was formed in advance of the 1904 election , Rutherford was urged to accept the Liberal nomination , but demurred . Peter Talbot was selected instead and , supported by Rutherford , was elected . 
 = = = Selection as Premier = = = 
 In February 1905 , the federal government of Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier introduced legislation to create two new provinces — Alberta and Saskatchewan — from the Northwest Territories . Though Haultain wanted the new provinces to be governed on the same non @-@ partisan basis as the Territories had been , it was expected that the Liberal Laurier would recommend a Liberal to serve as Lieutenant @-@ Governor , and it was further assumed that the Lieutenant @-@ Governor would call on a Liberal to form the new province 's first government . Oliver was the province 's most prominent Liberal , but had just been named federal Minister of the Interior , and was not interested in leaving Ottawa . Talbot was Laurier 's preferred candidate , but he expected to be appointed to the Senate and found the prospect more congenial than serving as Premier of Alberta . Both men supported Rutherford , though neither was enthusiastic about doing so . In August , Bulyea was appointed Alberta 's first Lieutenant @-@ Governor and later that month the Alberta Liberals selected Rutherford as their first leader . A final barrier was removed a few days later when Haultain , who was a Conservative federally but who was thought to be a potential leader of a coalition government , announced that he would stay in Regina to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives . On September 2 , Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the first government of Alberta . 
 After accepting the position of premier , Rutherford selected a geographically diverse cabinet on September 6 : Edmonton 's Charles Wilson Cross as Attorney @-@ General , Calgary 's William Henry Cushing as Minister of Public Works , Medicine Hat 's William Finlay as Minister of Agriculture and Provincial Secretary , and Lethbridge 's George DeVeber as Minister without Portfolio . Rutherford kept for himself the positions of Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Education . 
 = = Premier = = 
 = = = 1905 election = = = 
 Rutherford was Premier , but had not yet faced the people in an election and did not yet have a legislature to which he could propose legislation . Elections for the first Legislative Assembly of Alberta were accordingly fixed for November 9 . The Conservatives , the young province 's only other political party , had already selected R. B. Bennett as their leader . Bennett attacked the terms under which Alberta had been made a province , especially the clauses that left control of its lands and natural resources in the hands of the federal government and required the continued provincial funding of separate schools . He pointed out that Canada 's older provinces had control of their own natural resources and that education was a provincial responsibility under the British North America Act . The Liberals responded to these criticisms by highlighting the financial compensation the province received from the federal government in exchange for control of its natural resources , which amounted to $ 375 @,@ 000 per year . They further suggested that Conservative concern for control of lands was due to their desire to make favourable land concessions to the unpopular Canadian Pacific Railway , which had historically been friendly with the Conservatives , and for whom Bennett had acted as solicitor . 
 Besides the Conservatives ' ties to the CPR , Rutherford 's Liberals enjoyed the incumbent 's advantage of controlling the levers of patronage , and the election 's result was never really in doubt . Before the election , Talbot predicted that the government would win 18 of the province 's 25 seats . Immediately after the election it appeared that the Liberals had won 21 ; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives ' two . Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding . When the outcome was clear , the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire . 
 = = = First legislature and regional tensions = = = 
 One of the most contentious issues facing the newly elected government was the decision of the province 's capital city . The federal legislation creating the province had fixed Edmonton as the provisional capital , much to the chagrin of Calgary . Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign , but selecting a permanent capital was high on the list of the new legislature 's orders of business . Calgary 's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing , Edmonton 's by Attorney @-@ General Cross . Banff and Red Deer were also possibilities , but motions to select each failed to find <unk> . In the end , Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members — including Rutherford — to eight . 
 A personal priority of Rutherford had been the establishment of a university . Though the Edmonton Bulletin opined that it would be unfair " that the people of the Province should be taxed for the special benefit of four per cent that they may be able to attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer , who has to pay for it " , Rutherford proceeded quickly . He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges , striking a blow to his dream of a high quality non @-@ sectarian system of post @-@ secondary education . A bill establishing the University was passed by the legislature , but left the government to decide the location . Calgary felt that , having lost the fight to be provincial capital , it could expect the university to be established there , and was not pleased a year later when the government announced the founding of the University of Alberta in Rutherford 's hometown of Strathcona . 
 While these regionally charged issues attracted much attention , they were far from the government 's only initiatives during the legislature 's first session . In 1906 it passed a series of acts dealing with the organization and administration of the new provincial government and incorporated the cities of Lethbridge , Medicine Hat , and Wetaskiwin . It also established a speed limit of 20 miles per hour ( 32 km / h ) for motorized vehicles and set up a regime for mine inspection . Perhaps most significantly , it set up a court system , with Arthur Lewis Sifton as the province 's first Chief Justice . 
 Though the founding of the University of Alberta was the centrepiece of Rutherford 's educational policy , his activity as Minister of Education extended well beyond it . In the first year of Alberta 's existence , 140 new schools were established , and a normal school was set up in Calgary to train teachers . Rutherford put great emphasis on the creation of English @-@ language schools in the large portions of the province occupied primarily by <unk> and eastern @-@ European immigrants . The immigrants themselves were often unable to speak English , and the provision of these schools for their children was a major factor in their rapid assimilation into Albertan society . They were also in lieu of separate religious schools for groups such as Mennonites ; while the continued existence of Roman Catholic separate schools was mandated by the terms of Alberta 's admission into Confederation , the government 's policy was otherwise to encourage a unified and secular public school system . Rutherford also introduced free school texts in the province , though he was criticized for commissioning the texts from a Toronto publisher ( which printed them in New York ) rather than locally . 
 = = = Labour unrest = = = 
 The winter of 1906 – 07 was the coldest in Alberta history ; this was exacerbated by a shortage of coal . One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province . At the beginning of April 1907 the Canada West Coal and Coke Company locked out the miners from its mine near Taber . The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the Crow 's Nest Pass , where miners were refusing to sign a new contract . The problem spread , until by April 22 all 3 @,@ 400 miners working for member @-@ companies of the Western Coal Operators ' Association were off work . Miners ' demands included increased wages , a reduction in working hours to eight per day ( from ten ) , the posting of mine inspection reports , the isolated storage of explosives , the use of non @-@ freezing explosives , and semi @-@ monthly rather than monthly pay ; the mine operators objected to this last point on the basis that many miners did not report to work the day after payday , and it was thus desirable to keep <unk> to a minimum . 
 Rutherford 's government appointed a commission in February , but it was not until May that it met . It consisted of Chief Justice Sifton , mining executive Lewis Stockett , and miners ' union executive William <unk> . It began taking evidence in July . In the meantime , a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay ; coal supply promptly increased , as did its price . In August , the commission released its recommendations , which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines , the posting of inspectors ' reports , mandatory bath houses at mine sites , and improved ventilation inspection . It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use . The commission was silent on wages , other than to say that these should not be fixed by legislation , the operation of company stores ( a sore point among the miners ) , and the incorporation of mine unions which was recommended by mines but opposed by the unions . It also made no recommendation about working hours , but Rutherford 's government legislated an eight @-@ hour day anyway . 
 Apart from coal mining issues , the government also passed workers ' compensation legislation designed to make such compensation automatic , rather than requiring the injured worker to sue his employer . Labour representatives criticized the bill for failing to impose fines on negligent employers and for limiting construction workers ' eligibility under the program to injuries sustained while working on buildings more than 40 feet ( 12 m ) in height , as well as for its exemption of casual labourers . It also viewed the maximum payout of $ 1 @,@ 500 as inadequate . In response to these concerns , the maximum was increased to $ 1 @,@ 800 and the minimum building height reduced to 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) . In response to farmers ' concerns , farm labourers were exempt from the bill entirely . 
 Rutherford 's relationship with organized labour was never easy . Historian L.G. Thomas argued that there was little indication that Rutherford had any interest in courting the labour vote . In 1908 , Labour candidate Donald McNabb was elected in a Lethbridge by @-@ election ; the riding had previously been held by a Liberal . McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta , though he was defeated in his 1909 re @-@ election bid . 
 = = = Public works = = = 
 Rutherford 's Liberals self @-@ identified as the party of free enterprise , in contrast to the public ownership @-@ supporting Conservatives . Despite this , they made a limited number of large @-@ scale forays into government operation of utilities , the most notable of which was the creation of Alberta Government Telephones . In 1906 , Alberta 's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies . Several , including Edmonton , did so , alongside private companies . The largest of this latter group was the Bell Telephone Company , which held a monopoly over service in Calgary . Such monopolies and the private firms ' refusal to extend their services into sparsely populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market , which was effected in 1907 . The government constructed a number of lines , beginning with one between Calgary and Banff , and also purchased Bell 's lines for $ 675 @,@ 000 . 
 Alberta 's public telephone system was financed by debt , which was unusual for a government like Rutherford 's that was generally committed to the principle of " pay as you go " . Rutherford 's stated rationale was that the cost of such a large capital project shouldn 't be borne by a single generation and that incurring debt to finance a corresponding asset was , in contrast to operating deficits , acceptable . Though the move was popular at the time , it would prove not to be a financially astute one : by focusing on areas neglected by existing companies , the government was entering into the most expensive and least profitable fields of telecommunication . These problems would not come to fruition until Rutherford had left office , however ; in the short @-@ term , the government 's involvement in the telephone business helped it to a sweeping victory in the 1909 election , in which the Liberals won 37 of 41 seats in the newly expanded legislature . 
 Of equal profile was Rutherford 's government 's management of the province 's railways . Alberta 's early years were optimistic ones , which manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm for the construction of new railway lines . Every town wanted to be a railway centre , and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low freight rates to the province 's farmers provided sufficient charters were issued to competing companies . The legislature passed government @-@ sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907 , but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited . In the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province 's lines , the government offered loan guarantees to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines . Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population , rather than having railway expansion follow population growth as would be the case without government intervention . The Conservatives argued that this strategy didn 't go far enough , and called for direct government ownership . 
 While most public works issues were handled by Public Works Minister Cushing , following the 1909 election Rutherford named himself as the province 's first Minister of Railways .

 When the legislature met for the first time after the 1909 election , things seemed to be going well for Rutherford and his government . He controlled a huge majority , albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election , and enjoyed widespread popularity . His government had achieved significant success in setting up a new province , and this success looked poised to continue . Early in this new legislative session , however , two signs of trouble appeared : Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle began to ask questions about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company , and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement . 
 The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one of several companies that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province . The government support that it received was more generous than that received by more established railways , such as the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway . Boyle , Cushing , and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government , and pointed to the sale of government @-@ guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence . Because of the high interest rate they paid , the bonds were sold at above par value , but the government only received par for them , leaving the company to pocket the difference . 
 Boyle sponsored a motion of non @-@ confidence against the government . Despite enjoying the support of twelve Liberals , including Cushing , the motion was defeated and the government upheld . Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission , but pressure from many Liberals , including Bulyea , led him to resign May 26 , 1910 ; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton , hitherto the province 's chief judge . In November , the royal commission issued its report . It found that the evidence did not show a conflict of interest on Rutherford 's part , but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier . A minority report was much kinder , <unk> perfect satisfaction with Rutherford 's version of events .

 After resigning as Premier , Rutherford continued to sit as a Liberal MLA . He commanded the loyalty of many Liberals who had supported his government through the Alberta and Great Waterways issue , though this faction began increasingly to see Cross as its real leader . Rutherford opposed the Sifton government 's decision to confiscate the Alberta and Great Waterways bond money and revoke its charter , and in 1913 was one of only two Liberals to support a non @-@ confidence motion against the government ( Cross had by this time joined the Sifton cabinet , which placated most members of the Cross @-@ Rutherford faction ) . In the 1913 election , Rutherford was again nominated as the Liberal candidate in Edmonton South ( Strathcona had been amalgamated into Edmonton in 1912 ) , despite pledging opposition to the Sifton government and offering to campaign around the province for the Conservatives if they agreed not to run a candidate against him . At the nomination meeting , he stated that he was " not running as a Sifton candidate " and was " a good independent candidate ... and a good Liberal too " . Despite his opposition to the government , the Conservatives declined his offer of support and nominated Herbert Crawford to run against him . After a vigorous campaign , Crawford defeated Rutherford by fewer than 250 votes . Cross lobbied Prime Minister Laurier unsuccessfully for Rutherford to be appointed to the Senate , though he was made King 's Counsel shortly after his electoral defeat . 
 The 1913 election was not the first time Rutherford had dissented from his own party during an election , nor would it be the last . Before the 1911 federal election , several local Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver had asked Rutherford to run against him in Strathcona . Relations between Oliver and Rutherford had always been chilly — Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross , who he viewed as a rival for dominance of the Liberal party in Alberta , and his Edmonton Bulletin had taken the side of the dissidents during the railway scandal . A nominating meeting unanimously nominated Rutherford as Liberal candidate , though Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting . Before this meeting came to pass , however , Rutherford abruptly withdrew . Historian Douglas Babcock has suggested that this was due to the Conservatives ' nomination of William Antrobus Griesbach , dashing Rutherford 's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude their opposing him . Rumours at the time alleged that Rutherford had been asked to make a personal contribution of $ 15 @,@ 000 to his campaign fund , and had balked . Rutherford himself cited a desire to avoid splitting the vote on reciprocity , which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed . Whatever the reason , Oliver went on to be nominated as Liberal candidate and was re @-@ elected . 
 After his defeat in 1913 , Rutherford was not active in politics until 1921 . In that year 's provincial election , he campaigned actively for the Conservatives , including for Crawford , the man who had defeated him eight years earlier . Rutherford continued to call himself a Liberal , but criticized the incumbent administration for the growth of the provincial debt and for letting the party fall into disarray . Calling the Charles Stewart @-@ led government " rotten " , he offered voters the slogan " get rid of the barnacles and the Boyles " . The Liberals were defeated , but the landslide win by the United Farmers of Alberta left the Conservatives with only one seat . 
 = = = Professional career = = = 
 Once out of politics , Rutherford returned to his law practice . His partnership with Jamieson saw partners come and go . Rutherford divided his time between the original Strathcona office and the Edmonton office he opened in 1910 ; his practice focussed on contracts , real estate , wills and estates , and incorporations . In 1923 , Rutherford 's son Cecil joined the firm along with Stanley Harwood McCuaig , who in 1919 would marry Rutherford 's daughter Hazel . In 1925 , Jamieson left the partnership to establish his own firm . In 1939 , McCuaig did the same . Cecil 's partnership with his father continued until the latter 's death . 
 Besides his work as a lawyer , Alexander Rutherford was involved in a number of business enterprises . He was President of the Edmonton Mortgage Corporation , and Vice President and solicitor of the Great Western Garment Company . This latter enterprise , which Rutherford co @-@ founded , was a great success : established in 1911 with eight seamstresses , it had quadrupled in size within a year . During the Second World War , the Great Western Garment Company made military uniforms and was reputed to be the largest garment operation in the British Empire . It was acquired by Levi Strauss & Co. in 1961 , but continued to manufacture garments in Edmonton until 2004 . 
 Rutherford also acted as director of the Canada National Fire Insurance Company , the Imperial Canadian Trust Company , the Great West Permanent Loan Company , and the Monarch Life Assurance Company . 
 = = = University of Alberta = = = 
 Education was a personal priority of Rutherford 's , as evidenced by his retention of the office of Education Minister for his entire time as Premier and by his enthusiastic work in founding the University of Alberta . In 1911 he was elected by Alberta 's university graduates to the University of Alberta Senate , responsible for the institution 's academic affairs . In 1912 he established the Rutherford Gold Medal in English for the senior year honours English student with the highest standing ; the prize still exists today as the Rutherford Memorial Medal in English . In 1912 , with the University 's first graduating class , Rutherford instituted a tradition of inviting <unk> students to his house for tea ; this tradition would last for twenty @-@ six years . 
 Convocation was not the only reason that students visited Rutherford 's home : he had a wealth of both knowledge and books on Canadian subjects , and welcomed students to consult his private library . This library eventually expanded beyond the room in his mansion devoted to it , to encompass the house 's den , maid 's sitting room , and garage as well . After his death , the collection was donated and sold to the University 's library system ; it was described in 1967 as " still the most important rare collection in the library " . 
 Rutherford remained on the university senate until 1927 , when he was elected Chancellor . The position was the titular head of the university , and its primary duty was presiding over convocations . According to Rutherford biographer Douglas Babcock , this was the honour that Rutherford prized most . He was acclaimed to the position every four years until his death . It has been estimated that he awarded degrees to more than five thousand students . His final convocation , however , was marred by controversy : in 1941 , a committee of the university senate recommended awarding an honorary degree to Premier William Aberhart . Aberhart was pleased , and happily accepted University President William Alexander Robb Kerr 's invitation to deliver the commencement address at convocation . However , a week prior to convocation the full senate — responsible for all university academic affairs — met , and voted against awarding Aberhart a degree . Aberhart rescinded his acceptance of Kerr 's invitation ( and later removed the senate 's authority — except , ironically , the authority to award honorary degrees ) and Kerr resigned in protest . Rutherford was mortified , but presided over convocation nonetheless . 
 = = = Community involvement and family life = = = 
 Rutherford remained active in a wide range of community organizations well after his departure from politics . He was a deacon in his church until well into his dotage , was a member of the Young Women 's Christian Association advisory board from 1913 until his death , was Edmonton 's first exalted ruler of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and spent three years as the grand exalted ruler of the Elk Order of Canada . During World War I he was Alberta director of the National Service Commission , which oversaw conscription from 1916 until 1918 , and in 1916 was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 194th Highland Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force . Rutherford served on the Loan Advisory Committee of the Soldier Settlement Board after the war , was President of the Alberta Historical Society ( which had been created by his government ) from 1919 until his death , was elected President of the McGill University Alumni Association of Alberta in 1922 , and spent the last years of his life as honorary president of the Canadian Authors Association . He was also a member of the Northern Alberta Pioneers and Old @-@ Timers Association , the British Association for the Advancement of Science , the Royal Colonial Institute of London , and the Masons . He continued to curl and played tennis into his late fifties , and took up golf at the age of sixty @-@ four , becoming a charter member of the Mayfair Golf and Country Club . He received honorary doctorates of laws from four universities : McGill , the University of Alberta , McMaster University , and the University of Toronto . 
 In 1911 , the <unk> built a new house adjacent to the University of Alberta campus . Rutherford named it " <unk> " , after his ancestral homeland . It is now known as Rutherford House , and serves as a museum . He made several trips to the United Kingdom , and was invited to attend the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth , but had to return to Canada before the event . On December 19 , 1938 , the <unk> celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary ; tributes and well @-@ wishes arrived from across Canada . 
 = = = Death and legacy = = = 
 Besides his bronchitis , Rutherford developed diabetes in later years . His wife monitored his sugar intake , though when they were apart Rutherford sometimes took less care than she would have liked him to . In 1938 , possibly as a result of diabetes , he suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed and mute . He learned to walk again and with the help of a grade one reader got his speech back . September 13 , 1940 , Mattie Rutherford died of cancer . Less than a year later , June 11 , 1941 , Rutherford suffered a fatal heart attack while in hospital for insulin treatment . He was 84 years old . Alexander Rutherford was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Edmonton , alongside his family . His name was attached to many institutions both during his life and after : Rutherford Elementary School in Edmonton was established in 1911 and the University of Alberta 's Rutherford Library in 1951 . In 1954 , a mountain in Jasper National Park was named Mount Rutherford . In 1980 , the government of Alberta created the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship , which awards more than $ 20 million annually to high school students selected on the basis of a minimum of a 75 % average . The top ten students receiving Alexander Rutherford scholarships are recognized as ' Rutherford Scholars ' , and are presented with an additional scholarship and plaque . 
 Rutherford 's policy legacy is mixed . L. G. Thomas concludes that he was a weak leader , unable to dominate the ambitions of his lieutenants and with very little skill at debate . Despite this , he recognizes the Rutherford government 's legacy of province building . Douglas Babcock suggests that Rutherford , while himself honourable , left himself at the mercy of unscrupulous men who ultimately ruined his political career . Bennett , Rutherford 's rival and later Prime Minister , concurred with this assessment , calling Rutherford " a gentleman of the old school ... not equipped by experience or temperament for the rough and tumble of western politics " . There is general agreement that Rutherford 's greatest legacy , and the one in which he took the most pride , lies in his contributions to Alberta 's education . As Mount Royal College historian Patricia Roome concluded her chapter on Rutherford in a book about Alberta 's first twelve premiers , " Rutherford 's educational contribution remains his ultimate legacy to Albertans .

 " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " is the ninth episode in the first season of the American animated television series South Park . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on December 17 , 1997 . In the episode , the Jewish character Kyle feels excluded from the town 's celebrations during Christmas , and is comforted by Mr. Hankey , a talking and singing lump of feces wearing a red hat . Mr. Hankey does not come alive in the presence of other characters , so they think that Kyle is delusional . In another plot strand , the townspeople remove all religious aspects of Christmas from South Park to remain politically correct and inoffensive . 
 The episode was written and directed by the series ' co @-@ creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone . The Mr. Hankey character was based on an idea from Parker 's childhood ; when Parker and Stone conceived the South Park series , they wanted to make Mr. Hankey the lead character . Heavily influenced by the Peanuts Christmas special A Charlie Brown Christmas , " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " was the first Christmas @-@ themed South Park episode , the first musical episode , and the only episode in season one ( and therefore the first time in the series ) in which Kenny does not die . It was a satire of political correctness and religious sensitivity . Parker and Stone felt the episode elevated South Park to a new level of popularity and relevance . 
 The episode received generally positive reviews and has been described as one of the classic South Park episodes . It was viewed in about 4 @.@ 5 million households during its original broadcast , the highest Nielsen rating to that date for South Park and the fourth @-@ highest overall for a basic cable entertainment program of 1997 . In addition to Mr. Hankey himself , the episode introduced the popular South Park songs " A Lonely Jew on Christmas " and " Kyle 's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch " . John Kricfalusi , the creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show , accused Parker and Stone of stealing the idea for Mr. Hankey from him , which the duo vehemently denied . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Kyle is playing Saint Joseph in the South Park Elementary School 's Christmas nativity play , but he is forced to quit when his mother hears of the play and expresses outrage that her Jewish son is being forced to participate in a Christian production . She demands that the religious elements be taken out of the public school , and threatens to take her case to the mayor . Kyle suggests he could sing the " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " song as a non @-@ religious substitute , but his suggestion is rejected because nobody else believes in Mr. Hankey , a living and talking " Christmas poo " . Kyle leaves the school feeling lonely and excluded because he cannot celebrate Christmas with everyone else . 
 Mayor McDaniels decides that anything offensive to anyone will be removed from the Christmas celebrations , including Santa Claus , Christmas trees , wreaths , fairy lights , candy canes , mistletoe and the Star of Bethlehem . Kyle once again tries to suggest that they use Mr. Hankey as a non @-@ religious Christmas icon since he does not discriminate against anyone . At home , Kyle is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey . While Kyle is brushing his teeth , Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet , spreading feces stains everywhere he goes , prompting Kyle 's parents to blame Kyle for the mess . Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real , but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned , dried @-@ out piece of feces when he is around people who do not believe in him , leading Cartman to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them is some kind of Jewish tradition . Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman 's face as he sings " Kyle 's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch " in D Minor , and Kyle is blamed . He is sent to talk to guidance counselor , Mr. Mackey , but Kyle only gets into further trouble when Mr. Hankey takes a bath in Mr. Mackey 's coffee . Cartman , Stan and Kenny believe Kyle is insane and check him into a mental institution . 
 Like the whole town , the school Christmas pageant is stripped of all symbols of Christmas , and the children instead present a minimalist song and dance created by composer Philip Glass . The parents , astounded by how awful the pageant has turned out , begin blaming one another for destroying Christmas and a fight breaks out . When Chef finds out where Kyle is , he reveals to the children that Mr. Hankey does actually exist . When all the children start believing , Mr. Hankey finally reveals himself to everyone and scolds them for losing sight of the good things of Christmas and focusing on the bad . The townspeople release Kyle from the asylum and apologize , then they all sing Christmas songs and watch Mr. Hankey fly away with Santa Claus . Cartman , Stan , and Kyle feel that something is still missing . " THE END " then appears , and Kenny is excited and relieved that he has survived the entire episode without getting killed in spite of being involved in dangerous and life @-@ threatening situations throughout . 
 During the end credits , Jesus dejectedly sings , " Happy Birthday " to himself alone in his television studio .

 The Mr. Hankey character was based on an idea Trey Parker 's father created when he was toilet @-@ training Trey as a child . Parker said he refused to flush the toilet as a child , so his father told him if he did not flush down his stool , which he called " Mr. Hankey " , it would come to life and kill him . The concept stayed with Parker throughout his childhood ; starting in elementary school and throughout his entire education , he would often draw the character in class , wearing a sailor 's hat instead of the Santa Claus hat he would later wear in South Park . Parker shared the concept with future South Park co @-@ creator Matt Stone when the two met at the University of Colorado at Boulder , and the duo immediately knew they wanted to create a film or production involving Mr. Hankey . The two discussed filming a three @-@ minute short film involving a boy who befriended the talking stool , but Mr. Hankey would not come alive for anybody else , prompting others to believe the boy was crazy . They planned for the boy 's parents to find him holding a stool in the bathroom and blame the child for smearing feces along the walls when it was actually Mr. Hankey 's fault ; they also planned to have him visit a school counselor , where Mr. Hankey would leap into the counselor 's coffee mug and the boy would be blamed . At the end , it would turn out that the boy was indeed crazy and Mr. Hankey was not real at all , but a figment of the boy 's imagination . Parker and Stone never made the short film , but practically all of its elements were included in the future South Park episode " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " , with the notable exception of the ending . 
 Although the Mr. Hankey short film was never made , Parker and Stone made two Christmas @-@ related animated short films called The Spirit of Christmas , which served as precursors to the South Park series . When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series , Parker and Stone originally conceived the idea of a South Park @-@ like show with four children characters , but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show 's main protagonist ; they planned to call it " The Mr. Hankey Show " . They pitched the idea to friend Brian Graden , then a television executive with the Fox Broadcasting Company , but he rejected it and said , according to Matt Stone , " I 'm not putting poo on my network " . Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist , but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode . Later , when Comedy Central expressed interest in the series , Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives . Parker claimed during a meeting , he said , " One thing we have to know before we really go any further : how do you feel about talking poo ? " The executives were receptive to the idea , which Parker said was one of the main reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel . 
 The elements of the episode involving Kyle 's loneliness as a Jew during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone 's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood . Although the two went to different schools , they both witnessed Jewish children get beat up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with ; although Stone himself is Jewish , he was not raised as a practicing Jew and so he did not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand . The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non @-@ Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up . Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own Hanukkah song while everybody else sang Christmas songs ; although the idea was to make the student feel special , Parker said it only made her feel more lonely and isolated . 
 = = = Episode production = = = 
 " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " was written and directed by Parker and Stone , and first aired in the United States on Comedy Central on December 17 , 1997 . It was the first official South Park Christmas episode . Television journalists said the Spirit of Christmas shorts were precursors to Mr. Hankey and that they shared some common traits , but that the television episode was considered tamer and more tasteful . Parker and Stone originally conceived the episode " Damien " , which involves a boxing match between Jesus and Satan , as the first season 's Christmas episode . Although they had long planned to feature Mr. Hankey in the show , they did not decide to make him a Christmas character until halfway through the filming of " Damien " . Once they made the decision , they decided to make " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " the holiday episode instead ; although it would not air until after the " Mr. Hankey " episode , Parker and Stone finished production of " Damien " before working on " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " . 
 At the time they were writing the episode , Parker and Stone had seen a large number of news reports about government buildings refusing to allow the display of models of the nativity scene and other Christian holiday symbols , in an effort not to offend other religions . Parker and Stone , as two agnostics who still appreciated the Christmas holiday , said they felt the idea was " ridiculous " and , according to Stone , " We just wanted Mr. Hankey to say Christmas was about good and about presents , and it doesn 't have to be this religious [ controversy ] . " The two sought to write an episode in the tradition of old classic Christmas specials with their own irreverent South Park twist , and so they watched the famous 1965 Peanuts special , A Charlie Brown Christmas , repeatedly during the production process . Parker said , " At this point , we just sort of wanted to do a Charlie Brown Christmas South Park version . That [ special ] was definitely a huge part of my life growing up . " 
 The episode was considered the first South Park musical episode , and included such songs as " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " , " A Lonely Jew on Christmas " and " Kyle 's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch " . Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because , Parker said , " The general rule was people hated musicals " . For the Mr. Hankey character , Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college , except that Mr. Hankey would prove to be real , not a figment of Kyle 's imagination . Parker said this was decided because of his frustration with the character Mr. Snuffleupagus in the children 's show Sesame Street ; for his first 14 years on the show , Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by Big Bird , which Parker said " really bummed me out " . Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the wholesomeness and morals of cartoons from the 1930s , so they designed him to resemble the version of Mickey Mouse in the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie , particularly in his eyes . For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks , the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted it into the episode . Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey , but Stone said it came to him while eating a Sausage McMuffin at a McDonald 's in New York City , while taking a break from promoting South Park to the press . 
 Although Comedy Central did not object to most aspects of the episode , they did require some edits to material they deemed potentially offensive . During rehearsal for a Nativity play , a baby Jesus resembling a fetus pops out of Wendy , who is playing the Virgin Mary , and is caught by Kyle , who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth . Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode , Comedy Central executives had problems with it and Parker said they had to handle its animation " very carefully " . Additionally , during filming of the live @-@ action Mr. Hankey commercial , the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and took a bite out of it . Comedy Central officials would not allow the scene in the episode and it was changed to portray the idea that the baby had already eaten the stool off @-@ camera , which Parker said he felt was actually funnier . 
 " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " is the first episode in which Kenny was not killed . Parker and Stone deliberately included several scenes that looked like they might lead to Kenny 's death , but they decided because it was Christmas that they would not kill him . The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti @-@ semite and racist , particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she can get rid of all the Mexicans in South Park . Parker said this decision was made because , " Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town , and there 's obviously so much wrong with him mentally . A person that disturbed being a racist is funny to us . "

 " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " was released , along with 11 other episodes , in a three @-@ DVD set in November 1998 . It was included in the third volume , which also included the episodes " Starvin ' Marvin " , " Mecha @-@ Streisand " and " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " . " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " was also one of six episodes included on a 1998 VHS called " South Park Festival Special " , which included " Starvin ' Marvin " , " Merry Christmas , Charlie Manson ! " , " Mr. Hankey 's Christmas Classics " , " Korn 's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery " and " Pinkeye " . It was later released in the November 2007 DVD release " Christmas Time in South Park " , which also included the episodes , " Merry Christmas , Charlie Manson ! " , " Mr. Hankey 's Christmas Classics " , " A Very Crappy Christmas " , " Red Sleigh Down " , " It 's Christmas in Canada " and " Woodland Critter Christmas " . The episode , along with the other 12 from the first season , was also included in the DVD release " South Park : The Complete First Season " , which was released on November 12 , 2002 . Parker and Stone recorded commentary track for each episode , but they were not included with the DVDs due to " standards " issues with some of the statements ; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored , so they were released in a CD completely separately from the DVDs . 
 Songs from " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " were featured in the October 2007 CD soundtrack release called " Mr. Hankey 's Christmas Classics " . The Birmingham News said the album " gleefully tramples on one of America 's most cherished holidays [ and ] will likely make even cynical listeners gasp " .

 " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " is a satire on political correctness and religious sensitivity , particularly in its portrayal of the characters organizing " The Happy , Non @-@ Offensive , Non @-@ Denominational Christmas Play " to avoid offending anyone of any religious backgrounds . While many Christmas specials focus on the religious , spiritual and moral values of the Christmas holiday rather than the commercial aspects , " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " actually embraces commercialism in Christmas , suggesting viewers should enjoy those elements of the holiday without taking religion too seriously . York University Professor Alison Halsall said of this aspect of the episode , " Again , Parker and Stone blur the sacred and the profane , in this instance , to gut holidays of their traditional meanings . " 
 The episode has also been described as simultaneously embracing and parodying animated Christmas specials like A Charlie Brown Christmas , Frosty the Snowman and It 's the Great Pumpkin , Charlie Brown . It has also been described as a commentary on the way Jewish children are overlooked during the Christmas holiday ; this theme is overtly stated by Stan , who says at the end of the episode that Jews and Hanukkah " can be cool " as well as Christmas . M. Keith Booker , author of Drawn to Television : Prime @-@ Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy , said although the episode is irreverent in its treatment of Christmas , " even if spearheaded by a singing turd , [ it ] is about as close as South Park ever comes to being sentimental and nostalgic " . Literary critic Mark Caldwell said the fact that Kenny survived the episode demonstrates the episode 's " strong , albeit dutifully ironic , undercurrent of conventional holiday decency . " 
 Alison Halsall said " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " is the strongest example of a history of scatology , the study of excrement , throughout the South Park series . Halsall said the use of fecal matter as a character , and especially its tendency to smear parts of itself around as it moved , directly confronts the viewer with " the inherent dirtiness of the human body , no matter how much we try to <unk> it , Mr. Hankey 's stains systematically mess up the cleanliness of the social order . [ ... ] South Park refuses sanitization through the gross @-@ out factor . " 
 = = Cultural impact and references = = 
 Some writers consider Mr. Hankey one of the most easily recognizable and popular of the non @-@ regular South Park characters . His high @-@ pitched greeting , " Howdy @-@ ho " , was equally recognizable and became one of the most quoted lines from the show 's first season . Several fan websites were made about the character within months of the episode 's broadcast . In January 1998 , Entertainment Weekly reported that Comedy Central executives had plans to produce a Mr. Hankey chocolate bar . Larry Lieberman , the channel 's vice president of strategic planning and new business development , said a sketch of a Mr. Hankey candy bar was drawn and circulated , but mainly as a joke ; he said no serious discussions were held about producing such an item . A stuffed Mr. Hankey became one of the most popular South Park tie @-@ in products of the 1998 Christmas season . 
 In addition to the title character , " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " included the first appearances of characters Father Maxi and Mr. Mackey . Both characters appeared in " Damien " , which was produced before " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " , but the Christmas episode aired first . Mr. Mackey was inspired by Parker 's real @-@ life school guidance counselor ; Parker , who provides the voice for Mackey , said the real @-@ life counselor was similarly thin and wiry and that Parker 's voice for Mr. Mackey is an exact , <unk> version of how his counselor spoke . 
 " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " includes several references to the Peanuts holiday special , A Charlie Brown Christmas . A Christmas pageant features the same biblical quote spoken by Linus in that special ; additionally , the music featured in the pageant is very similar to the Peanuts special 's musical score by Vince Guaraldi , and the South Park kids go outside to catch falling snowflakes on their tongues in the same way as in the special . 
 A doctor prescribes Prozac , a real life antidepressant , to Kyle for his apparent love for feces , which he describes as " <unk> " , a condition perhaps better known by the medical term coprophilia . Composer Philip Glass composes the avant @-@ garde musical score for the non @-@ denominational Christmas play . Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass ; Parker , who was a music major in college , said , " I really thought you could basically tell a third grader to sit down at a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album , and no one would know the difference . " The do @-@ it @-@ yourself kit in the live action commercial , in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey , is similar to the Mr. Potato Head toy set .

 Although Parker and Stone credit " Big Gay Al 's Big Gay Boat Ride " as helping elevate the series , they felt " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " elevated South Park to a new level of popularity and relevance . Parker said of it , " This was the episode that just vaulted everything . " Following the success of " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " , a large number of celebrities started contacting Comedy Central with the hopes of making guest appearances in South Park episodes . This allowed Parker and Stone to practically take their pick of guest stars , and led to appearances by Natasha Henstridge in " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " and Robert Smith in " Mecha @-@ Streisand " . Stone said although " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " has become less shocking with time , viewers at the time of the episode 's original broadcast were shocked , and some were horrified , at the idea of a living and speaking Christmas stool . " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " was the fourth @-@ highest overall basic cable entertainment program of 1997 . In its original American broadcast , the episode received a Nielsen Rating of 5 @.@ 4 , meaning the episode was seen by about 4 @.@ 5 million households . The rating was the highest yet for South Park , and was more than seven times the Comedy Central prime @-@ time average . The episode also earned a 51 share of the male demographic aged between 18 and 24 ; a share represents the percentage of households using a television at the time the program is airing . 
 " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " has been described as one of the classic episodes of South Park . Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News described Mr. Hankey himself as " the most outrageous character yet on TV 's most outrageous show " . Charlie Patton of The Florida Times @-@ Union said the episode was " crude , nasty , irreverent and generally offensive — also extremely funny " . He also said of the Mr. Hankey character , " If you 're the sort of person who didn 't care for that scene in Trainspotting where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository , the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing . " Doug Pratt , a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor , said , " Technically , the Christmas episode might well be the show 's best effort , artistically , because it tackles the PC @-@ <unk> of Christmas head @-@ on , and also has an interesting psychological subtext : does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey , or does he have some serious psychological problems ? " Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode , " It 's gross . It 's <unk> . It 's probably offensive . It 's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody 's airing this year . " Werts particularly praised the song " A Lonely Jew on Christmas " . Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock , author of Taking South Park Seriously , said , " This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable , both for Christmas specials and television in general , farther than any previous one . " Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode 's fake live @-@ action commercial . 
 Before the episode was released , Debbie Liebling , then @-@ Comedy Central vice president of development and production , herself described the episode as " adorably offensive " . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger called the episode " a brilliant skewering " of political correctness and over @-@ sensitivity , and called it " at once hilariously satiric and extraordinarily foul . " Sepinwall also added Mr. Hankey to his 1997 list of most memorable TV moments , describing the character as the year 's " most disturbing cartoon image " and as " a mythical holiday creature so bizarre and offensive it literally cannot be described in a family newspaper " . Matt Roush of USA Today praised the episode , which he described as " ribald , raunchy and riotous " . A.J. Jacobs of Entertainment Weekly said in January 1998 that the episode was " already infamous " . Jacobs also said Mr. Hankey was so popular , he half @-@ jokingly suggested Matt Parker and Trey Stone pursue a spin @-@ off revolving around the character . 
 The music in " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " was also praised . " A Lonely Jew on Christmas " has been described as a " classic song " , and " Kyle 's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch " , which reviewers described as one of Cartman 's trademarks , was included in the 1999 South Park film , South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut . Not all reviews of " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " were positive . Rick Marin of Newsweek described the episode as " simply one long potty joke " . Virginia Rohan of The Record said he liked Kyle 's song and some of Kenny 's antics , but said the episode was not as funny as The Spirit of Christmas shorts . Rohan said South Park " can be brilliantly over the edge , but often tonight , it sorely needs a comic bungee cord " . 
 In 2003 , the Chicago @-@ based RedEye ranked " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " the greatest South Park episode . In October 2004 , the Comedy Central website held a poll to determine the top 27 South Park episodes for a television marathon ; " Mr Hankey , the Christmas Poo " came third , just behind " Good Times with Weapons " at # 2 and " Fat Butt and Pancake Head " at # 1 . South Park Studios , the official South Park website , listed " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " at number four on its list of the Five Most Notorious Episodes .

 John Kricfalusi , the creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show , claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short , " Nutty the Friendly Dump " , which was part of a cartoon book series viewable online . Kricfalusi said after the show aired , " I got nine or 10 messages from friends screaming , ' I can 't believe this ! They totally stole your story ! ' ... This idea of [ feces ] singing or dancing and being friends , well , that is my idea . " Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of South Park were lifted from his work , and he told media outlets his company <unk> was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone . Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with " Nutty the Friendly Dump " and that the claim was " ludicrous " . Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of Ren & Stimpy , which he said he did not enjoy because the characters were too over @-@ the @-@ top and the voice acting was too annoying . Parker said Kricfalusi eventually contacted the South Park creators : " He wrote a letter back saying , ' Oh , OK , I see how it could just be a coincidence , but you should just admit to the press that you 're a big Ren and Stimpy fan . ' — I 'm not a Ren and Stimpy fan . " 
 = Ghost of a Chance ( Homicide : Life on the Street ) = 
 " Ghost of a Chance " is the second episode of the first season of the American police drama television series Homicide : Life on the Street . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 3 , 1993 . The teleplay was written Noel Behn based on a story by executive producer Tom Fontana , and the episode was directed by Martin Campbell . In it Bayliss begins his investigation into the murder of 11 @-@ year @-@ old Adena Watson , Munch and Bolander investigate the unusual death of an elderly man , and Howard insists she is receiving advice about her murder case from a ghost . 
 The episode marked the first major developments in the Watson case , a major season one story arc based on the real @-@ life slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace . The Wallace case was featured in David Simon 's non @-@ fiction book Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , from which the series was adapted . Baltimore Detective Tom Pellegrini , who handled the Wallace case , appears on @-@ screen as a detective in " Ghost of a Chance " . The episode introduced several important supporting characters , including prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers ( Željko Ivanek ) , Colonel Burt Granger ( Gerald F. Gough ) , Captain George Barnfather ( Clayton LeBouef ) and Officer Chris Thormann ( Lee Tergesen ) . 
 The episode introduces the concept of a " red ball " , a high @-@ profile case that draws close media and political attention . The term would be used frequently in future episodes . It was also the first episode to feature a murder in a wealthy rural setting . At the time , most American television police shows focused on crimes in poorer neighborhoods , so " Ghost of a Chance " was noted for demonstrating that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances . 
 The episode , seen by 9 @.@ 5 million households in its original broadcast , was considered a disappointment due to the drop in viewership from the post @-@ Super Bowl series debut , which had more than 18 million viewers . It received generally positive reviews , and was later featured in a Court TV marathon of the top 15 Homicide episodes . Gwen Verdon was nominated for an Emmy Award for her guest performance as Jessie Doohen , the woman accused of killing her husband of 60 years . The episode , along with the rest of the first and second seasons of Homicide : Life on the Street was released on DVD in the United States on May 27 , 2003 . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) is the primary detective on the murder investigation of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl named Adena Watson . A rookie detective on his first homicide case , Bayliss has difficulty informing the family , while the veteran Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) remains detached from his emotional response . Much of the homicide department is dedicated to the case , and Bayliss works without the benefit of his own desk . When Bayliss acts weak and indecisive during a department meeting , Gee ( Yaphet Kotto ) angrily orders him to show more confidence . But when a news report by journalist Griselda Battel ( Taylor Young ) discusses Bayliss ' lack of prior experience , Gee resists pressure from his superiors to replace Bayliss , insisting , " That rookie will surprise us all " . 
 Munch ( Richard Belzer ) and Bolander ( Ned Beatty ) arrive at the scene of a dead man named Thomas Doohen ( John <unk> ) , only to find that the man had only fainted and was still alive . When he wakes up , the man immediately starts arguing with his elderly wife Jessie ( Gwen Verdon ) , who is unhappy with their 60 @-@ year marriage and wishes the man were dead . Later that same day , they respond to the same house to find the same elderly man dead from a heart attack . Medical examiner Blythe ( Wendy Hughes ) classifies the death as a murder because the widow dragged him into the basement and " prayed he 'd stay dead " , but Bolander , himself having recently left an unhappy marriage , defends the widow . Despite the disagreement , Bolander becomes smitten with Blythe , and seeks romantic advice from Munch . 
 Prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers ( Željko Ivanek ) tells Howard ( Melissa Leo ) that if she cannot find more evidence against Ralph Fenwick ( Michael Sheldon ) , who is a suspect in a brutal murder , Danvers will have to plead to manslaughter . The next day , Howard tells her partner Felton ( Daniel Baldwin ) she was visited by the ghost of Fenwick 's murder victim and told where the murder weapon was , but Howard cannot find it . Felton does not believe her , and Howard grows angry when he tells Lewis ( Clark Johnson ) and Crosetti ( Jon Polito ) about the ghost experience . The next day , however , Howard and Felton arrest Fenwick after finding the murder weapon based on advice Felton got from a tarot card reader . 
 The department continues investigating leads into the Adena Watson case , including an interrogation of a man who lived within walking distance of the scene and was previously charged with murdering a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl . All of the leads turn into dead ends . While investigating the Adena Watson scene , police find coagulated blood and hair on a piece of metal . Battel witnesses the find , but agrees to hold the information until police authorize it , as long as she gets the story first . She also tells Bayliss about a carry @-@ out store owner who claims to know who the murderer is . The episode ends with an emotional Bayliss attending Watson 's funeral .

 " Ghost of a Chance " was written by Noel Behn based on a story by executive producer Tom Fontana , and was directed by Martin Campbell . It marked the first major developments the story arc of the Adena Watson murder case , which was introduced in the final scene of series premiere " Gone for Goode " and dominates much of the Homicide : Life on the Street first season . The Watson case was based on the real @-@ life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace , which is chronicled in Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , the 1991 David Simon non @-@ fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department , which was adapted into the Homicide series . " Ghost of a Chance " introduced the concept of a " red ball " , which is a police jargon phrase used in the episode to describe the Adena Watson murder . A red ball is a high @-@ profile case that draws such close media and political attention , that it diverts time and attention away from other cases in the homicide department . The phrase , which came directly from Simon 's book , would be used frequently in future Homicide : Life on the Street episodes . 
 " Ghost of a Chance " introduced several important characters that would be regularly featured throughout the series . Among them were prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers , played by Željko Ivanek , and police department bosses Colonel Burt Granger and Captain George Barnfather , played by Gerald F. Gough and Clayton LeBouef , respectively . Ivanek was cast by his long @-@ time friend Fontana , who thought Danvers was written in a dull and simple way , but felt confident Ivanek could " make it a real character " . The episode also introduced Officer Chris Thormann ( Lee Tergesen ) , who would become the center of a significant season one subplot in the next episode , " Son of a Gun " , when he would be shot in the head during a failed arrest . Detective Tom Pellegrini , who handled the real @-@ life Latonya Kim Wallace case and served as the basis for the Tim Bayliss character , appeared on @-@ screen as the police officer who first discovered Adena Watson 's body . Pellegrini , who was still haunted by his failure to solve the Wallace case , specifically asked to be in that scene . During filming , he stayed close to the actress who played Watson , which Secor interpreted as an attempt to make amends to the real Wallace child . Although Pellegrini personally advised Secor on his performance , the actor later said he learned more about how to play Bayliss by watching Pellegrini during that scene than anything else the detective could have told him . 
 In its portrayal of the possible murder of Thomas Doohen , " Ghost of a Chance " is the first Homicide episode to demonstrate a murder in a wealthy rural setting , rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location ; the episode was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances . This is particularly illustrated by Munch 's comment to Bolander , " Ah , green lawns , fresh air , nice houses , this is the place for a murder . " The episode also maintains a common Homicide trait of combining tragedy , like the devastated response by Adena Watson 's family to her murder , with scenes of dark comedy , like Jessie Doohen 's claim that she endured a miserable 60 @-@ year marriage because , " We made a promise we wouldn 't get a divorce until all the children were dead . " 
 " Ghost of a Chance " marked a development of Beau Felton 's character by identifying not only his trademark bullying nature , but a kinder and sweeter side of his personality . After mocking Howard publicly for her belief in ghosts , he puts in extra effort to find the killer by embracing Howard 's beliefs , much to her appreciation . Howard 's superstitious beliefs reappear in future episodes , particularly the fourth season episode " Heartbeat " , which featured a black cat inspired by Edgar Allan Poe 's short story , " The Black Cat " . A scene in which a busload of rookie police officers straight out of the academy are brought in to investigate the Adena Watson crime scene was inspired by strategies used by real police departments ; the New York Police Department employed exactly the same tactic while searching for the remains of a missing girl in upstate New York in 1987 .

 " Ghost of a Chance " continues a common motif repeated throughout the first season of Crosetti discussing various conspiracy theories about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln , the 16th president of the United States . Crosetti said he believes the killing was arranged by the highest ranks of the Confederate States of America . Crosetti 's fascination with the Lincoln assassination was based on Tom Fontana 's real @-@ life obsession with it . Throughout the episode , Lewis mournfully discussed the then @-@ recent closing of Baltimore 's Memorial Stadium . Fearing it will go to waste , Lewis wants to flood the stadium and turn it into an aquatic theme park . 
 The song " Hazy Shade of Blue " , by songwriter Tor Hyams , plays while the police raid several neighborhood homes in search of clues and leads in the Adena Watson murder case . The hymn " The Sweet By and By " , written by S. Fillmore Bennett and Joseph P. Webster , plays during Watson 's funeral in the final scene of the movie . Crosetti and Lewis sing the theme song to the children 's show Casper the Friendly Ghost while making fun of Howard about dreaming of ghosts .

 The episode received generally positive reviews .

Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun complimented the episode , particularly the performances of Beatty and Verdon . Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe said he enjoyed both the humor of the episode , such as the Gwen Verdon subplot , as well as dramatic touches , like Bayliss cleaning up the spilled corn flakes of Adena Watson 's despairing mother . 
 Not all reviews were positive . Liam Lacey said the episode was " not quite as taut " as the debut episode , particularly criticizing the ghost subplot . Lacey said , " There already appear a few cracks in the show 's engaging facade , including a drift toward the Northern Exposure @-@ style indulgent quirkiness . " Time magazine reviewer Richard Zoglin said the second episode " already seems to be marking time with goofy character diversions " , including Crosetti 's Lincoln conspiracies and Bolander 's requests for a date from Blythe .

 = El Greco = 
 Doménikos Theotokópoulos ( Greek : <unk> Θεοτοκόπουλος [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 1541 – 7 April 1614 ) , most widely known as El Greco ( pronounced : [ el <unk> ] ; Spanish for " The Greek " ) , was a painter , sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance . The nickname " El Greco " refers both to his Greek origin and Spanish citizenship . The artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters , <unk> Θεοτοκόπουλος ( Doménikos Theotokópoulos ) , often adding the word <unk> ( <unk> , " Cretan " ) . 
 El Greco was born in Crete , which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice , and the center of Post @-@ Byzantine art . He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice , as other Greek artists had done . In 1570 he moved to Rome , where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works . During his stay in Italy , El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance . In 1577 , he moved to Toledo , Spain , where he lived and worked until his death . In Toledo , El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best @-@ known paintings . 
 El Greco 's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century . El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism , while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis . El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school . He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation , marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Early years and family = = = 
 Born in 1541 , in either the village of <unk> or Candia ( the Venetian name of Chandax , present day Heraklion ) on Crete , El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family , which had probably been driven out of Chania to Candia after an uprising against the Venetians between 1526 and 1528 . El Greco 's father , <unk> Theotokópoulos ( d . 1556 ) , was a merchant and tax collector . Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife , also Greek . El Greco 's older brother , <unk> Theotokópoulos ( 1531 – 13 December 1604 ) , was a wealthy merchant and spent the last years of his life ( 1603 – 1604 ) in El Greco 's Toledo home . 
 El Greco received his initial training as an icon painter of the Cretan school , a leading center of post @-@ Byzantine art . In addition to painting , he probably studied the classics of ancient Greece , and perhaps the Latin classics also ; he left a " working library " of 130 books at his death , including the Bible in Greek and an annotated Vasari . Candia was a center for artistic activity where Eastern and Western cultures co @-@ existed harmoniously , where around two hundred painters were active during the 16th century , and had organized a painters ' guild , based on the Italian model . In 1563 , at the age of twenty @-@ two , El Greco was described in a document as a " master " ( " maestro <unk> " ) , meaning he was already a master of the guild and presumably operating his own workshop . Three years later , in June 1566 , as a witness to a contract , he signed his name as <unk> <unk> Θεοτοκόπουλος <unk> ( " Master <unk> Theotokópoulos , painter " ) . 
 Most scholars believe that the Theotokópoulos " family was almost certainly Greek Orthodox " , although some Catholic sources still claim him from birth . Like many Orthodox emigrants to Catholic areas of Europe , some assert that he may have transferred to Catholicism after his arrival , and possibly practiced as a Catholic in Spain , where he described himself as a " devout Catholic " in his will . The extensive archival research conducted since the early 1960s by scholars , such as Nikolaos <unk> , <unk> Prevelakis and Maria <unk> , indicates strongly that El Greco 's family and ancestors were Greek Orthodox . One of his uncles was an Orthodox priest , and his name is not mentioned in the Catholic archival baptismal records on Crete . Prevelakis goes even further , expressing his doubt that El Greco was ever a practicing Roman Catholic . 
 Important for his early biography , El Greco , still in Crete , painted his Dormition of the Virgin near the end of his Cretan period , probably before 1567 . Three other signed works of " <unk> " are attributed to El Greco ( Modena Triptych , St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child , and The Adoration of the Magi ) . In 1563 , at the age of twenty @-@ two , El Greco was already an enrolled master of the local guild , presumably in charge of his own workshop . He left for Venice a few years later , and never returned to Crete . His Dormition of the Virgin , of before 1567 in tempera and gold on panel ( 61 @,@ 4 x 45 cm , Holy Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin , <unk> , Syros ) was probably created near the end of El Greco 's Cretan period . The painting combines post @-@ Byzantine and Italian Mannerist stylistic and iconographic elements , and incorporates stylistic elements of the Cretan School . 
 = = = Italy = = = 
 It was natural for the young El Greco to pursue his career in Venice , Crete having been a possession of the Republic of Venice since 1211 . Though the exact year is not clear , most scholars agree that El Greco went to Venice around 1567 . Knowledge of El Greco 's years in Italy is limited . He lived in Venice until 1570 and , according to a letter written by his much older friend , the greatest miniaturist of the age , Giulio Clovio , was a " disciple " of Titian , who was by then in his eighties but still vigorous . This may mean he worked in Titian 's large studio , or not . Clovio characterized El Greco as " a rare talent in painting " . 
 In 1570 , El Greco moved to Rome , where he executed a series of works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship . It is unknown how long he remained in Rome , though he may have returned to Venice ( c . 1575 – 1576 ) before he left for Spain . In Rome , on the recommendation of Giulio Clovio , El Greco was received as a guest at the Palazzo Farnese , which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had made a center of the artistic and intellectual life of the city . There he came into contact with the intellectual elite of the city , including the Roman scholar Fulvio Orsini , whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist ( View of Mt . Sinai and a portrait of Clovio are among them ) . 
 Unlike other Cretan artists who had moved to Venice , El Greco substantially altered his style and sought to distinguish himself by inventing new and unusual interpretations of traditional religious subject matter . His works painted in Italy were influenced by the Venetian Renaissance style of the period , with agile , elongated figures reminiscent of Tintoretto and a chromatic framework that connects him to Titian . The Venetian painters also taught him to organize his multi @-@ figured compositions in landscapes vibrant with atmospheric light . Clovio reports visiting El Greco on a summer 's day while the artist was still in Rome . El Greco was sitting in a darkened room , because he found the darkness more conducive to thought than the light of the day , which disturbed his " inner light " . As a result of his stay in Rome , his works were enriched with elements such as violent perspective vanishing points or strange attitudes struck by the figures with their repeated twisting and turning and tempestuous gestures ; all elements of Mannerism . 
 By the time El Greco arrived in Rome , Michelangelo and Raphael were dead , but their example continued to be paramount , and somewhat overwhelming for young painters . El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views , ideas and style . He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise , but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo 's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel ; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking . When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo , El Greco replied that " he was a good man , but he did not know how to paint " . And thus we are confronted by a paradox : El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo , but he had found it impossible to withstand his influence . Michelangelo 's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League . By painting portraits of Michelangelo , Titian , Clovio and , presumably , Raphael in one of his works ( The Purification of the Temple ) , El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters . As his own commentaries indicate , El Greco viewed Titian , Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate . In his 17th century Chronicles , Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated , in various ways , a re @-@ evaluation of Michelangelo 's teachings . 
 Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs ( such as his dismissal of Michelangelo 's technique ) and personality , El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome . Architect and writer Pirro <unk> called him a " foolish foreigner " , and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese , who obliged the young artist to leave his palace . On 6 July 1572 , El Greco officially complained about this event . A few months later , on 18 September 1572 , El Greco paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter . At the end of that year , El Greco opened his own workshop and hired as assistants the painters <unk> <unk> de <unk> and Francisco <unk> . 
 = = = Spain = = = 
 = = = = Move to Toledo = = = = 
 In 1577 , El Greco migrated to Madrid , then to Toledo , where he produced his mature works . At the time , Toledo was the religious capital of Spain and a populous city with " an illustrious past , a prosperous present and an uncertain future " . In Rome , El Greco had earned the respect of some intellectuals , but was also facing the hostility of certain art critics . During the 1570s the huge monastery @-@ palace of El Escorial was still under construction and Philip II of Spain was experiencing difficulties in finding good artists for the many large paintings required to decorate it . Titian was dead , and Tintoretto , Veronese and <unk> Mor all refused to come to Spain . Philip had to rely on the lesser talent of Juan Fernández de <unk> , of whose <unk> y <unk> ( " seriousness and decorum " ) the king approved . However , Fernández died in 1579 ; the moment should have been ideal for El Greco . 
 Through Clovio and Orsini , El Greco met Benito Arias Montano , a Spanish humanist and agent of Philip ; Pedro Chacón , a clergyman ; and Luis de Castilla , son of Diego de Castilla , the dean of the Cathedral of Toledo . El Greco 's friendship with Castilla would secure his first large commissions in Toledo . He arrived in Toledo by July 1577 , and signed contracts for a group of paintings that was to adorn the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo and for the renowned El <unk> . By September 1579 he had completed nine paintings for Santo Domingo , including The Trinity and The Assumption of the Virgin . These works would establish the painter 's reputation in Toledo . 
 El Greco did not plan to settle permanently in Toledo , since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his court . Indeed , he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch : Allegory of the Holy League and Martyrdom of St. Maurice . However , the king did not like these works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the chapter @-@ house rather than the intended chapel . He gave no further commissions to El Greco . The exact reasons for the king 's dissatisfaction remain unclear . Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene ; some others that El Greco 's works violated a basic rule of the Counter @-@ Reformation , namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style . Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions , and had very decided tastes ; a long sought @-@ after sculpted Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini also failed to please when it arrived , and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place . Philip 's next experiment , with Federico <unk> was even less successful . In any case , Philip 's dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had .

 Lacking the favor of the king , El Greco was obliged to remain in Toledo , where he had been received in 1577 as a great painter . According to <unk> Félix Paravicino , a 17th @-@ century Spanish preacher and poet , " Crete gave him life and the painter 's craft , Toledo a better homeland , where through Death he began to achieve eternal life . " In 1585 , he appears to have hired an assistant , Italian painter Francisco <unk> , and to have established a workshop capable of producing altar frames and statues as well as paintings . On 12 March 1586 he obtained the commission for The Burial of the Count of <unk> , now his best @-@ known work . 
 The decade 1597 to 1607 was a period of intense activity for El Greco . During these years he received several major commissions , and his workshop created pictorial and sculptural ensembles for a variety of religious institutions . Among his major commissions of this period were three altars for the Chapel of San José in Toledo ( 1597 – 1599 ) ; three paintings ( 1596 – 1600 ) for the Colegio de Doña María de Aragon , an Augustinian monastery in Madrid , and the high altar , four lateral altars , and the painting St. Ildefonso for the Capilla Mayor of the Hospital de la Caridad ( Hospital of Charity ) at Illescas ( 1603 – 1605 ) . The minutes of the commission of The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception ( 1607 – 1613 ) , which were composed by the personnel of the municipality , describe El Greco as " one of the greatest men in both this kingdom and outside it " . 
 Between 1607 and 1608 El Greco was involved in a protracted legal dispute with the authorities of the Hospital of Charity at Illescas concerning payment for his work , which included painting , sculpture and architecture ; this and other legal disputes contributed to the economic difficulties he experienced towards the end of his life . In 1608 , he received his last major commission : for the Hospital of Saint John the Baptist in Toledo . 
 El Greco made Toledo his home . Surviving contracts mention him as the tenant from 1585 onwards of a complex consisting of three apartments and twenty @-@ four rooms which belonged to the Marquis de Villena . It was in these apartments , which also served as his workshop , that he passed the rest of his life , painting and studying . He lived in considerable style , sometimes employing musicians to play whilst he dined . It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish female companion , <unk> de Las Cuevas , whom he probably never married . She was the mother of his only son , Jorge Manuel , born in 1578 , who also became a painter , assisted his father , and continued to repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the studio . In 1604 , Jorge Manuel and <unk> de los Morales gave birth to El Greco 's grandson , Gabriel , who was baptized by Gregorio Angulo , governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the artist . 
 During the course of the execution of a commission for the Hospital Tavera , El Greco fell seriously ill , and a month later , on 7 April 1614 , he died . A few days earlier , on 31 March , he had directed that his son should have the power to make his will . Two Greeks , friends of the painter , witnessed this last will and testament ( El Greco never lost touch with his Greek origins ) . He was buried in the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo , aged 73 .

 = = = Technique and style = = = 
 The primacy of imagination and intuition over the subjective character of creation was a fundamental principle of El Greco 's style . El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion . He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art , but the painter achieves grace only if he manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease . 
 El Greco regarded color as the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting , and declared that color had primacy over form . Francisco Pacheco , a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611 , wrote that the painter liked " the colors crude and unmixed in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity " and that " he believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature " . 
 Art historian Max Dvořák was the first scholar to connect El Greco 's art with Mannerism and <unk> . Modern scholars characterize El Greco 's theory as " typically Mannerist " and pinpoint its sources in the Neoplatonism of the Renaissance . Jonathan Brown believes that El Greco endeavored to create a sophisticated form of art ; according to Nicholas Penny " once in Spain , El Greco was able to create a style of his own — one that disavowed most of the descriptive ambitions of painting " . 
 In his mature works El Greco demonstrated a characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe . The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience . According to Pacheco , El Greco 's perturbed , violent and at times seemingly careless @-@ in @-@ execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style . El Greco 's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions , which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles , led him to disregard the laws of nature and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents , particularly when they were destined for altarpieces . The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco 's mature works ; for The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another 1 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) " because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced , which is the worst thing that can happen to a figure ' " . A significant innovation of El Greco 's mature works is the interweaving between form and space ; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface . This interweaving would re @-@ emerge three centuries later in the works of Cézanne and Picasso . 
 Another characteristic of El Greco 's mature style is the use of light . As Jonathan Brown notes , " each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source " . Fernando Marias and Agustín Bustamante García , the scholars who transcribed El Greco 's handwritten notes , connect the power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying Christian Neo @-@ Platonism . 
 Modern scholarly research emphasizes the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco 's mature style and stresses the painter 's ability to adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings . Harold Wethey asserts that " although Greek by descent and Italian by artistic preparation , the artist became so immersed in the religious environment of Spain that he became the most vital visual representative of Spanish mysticism " . He believes that in El Greco 's mature works " the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain in the period of the Counter @-@ Reformation " . 
 El Greco also excelled as a portraitist , able not only to record a sitter 's features but also to convey their character . His portraits are fewer in number than his religious paintings , but are of equally high quality . Wethey says that " by such simple means , the artist created a memorable characterization that places him in the highest rank as a portraitist , along with Titian and Rembrandt " . 
 = = = Painting materials = = = 
 El Greco painted many of his paintings on fine canvas and employed a viscous oil medium . He painted with the usual pigments of his period such as azurite , lead @-@ tin @-@ yellow , vermilion , madder lake , ochres and red lead , but he seldom used the expensive natural ultramarine . 
 = = = Suggested Byzantine affinities = = = 
 Since the beginning of the 20th century , scholars have debated whether El Greco 's style had Byzantine origins . Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco 's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition , and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors , while others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco 's later work . 
 The discovery of the Dormition of the Virgin on Syros , an authentic and signed work from the painter 's Cretan period , and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s , contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories . Although following many conventions of the Byzantine icon , aspects of the style certainly show Venetian influence , and the composition , showing the death of Mary , combines the different doctrines of the Orthodox Dormition of the Virgin and the Catholic Assumption of the Virgin . Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work , including his supposed Byzantinism . Based on the notes written in El Greco 's own hand , on his unique style , and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters , they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art . According to Marina <unk> @-@ Plaka " far from the influence of Italy , in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace , Candia , the Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work " . In making this judgement , <unk> @-@ Plaka disagrees with Oxford University professors Cyril Mango and Elizabeth Jeffreys , who assert that " despite claims to the contrary , the only Byzantine element of his famous paintings was his signature in Greek lettering " . Nikos <unk> states that from 1570 El Greco 's painting is " neither Byzantine nor post @-@ Byzantine but Western European . The works he produced in Italy belong to the history of the Italian art , and those he produced in Spain to the history of Spanish art " . 
 The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco 's style in the intellectual sources of his Greek @-@ Christian education and in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial aspect of the Orthodox Church . Davies believes that the religious climate of the Counter @-@ Reformation and the aesthetics of mannerism acted as catalysts to activate his individual technique . He asserts that the philosophies of Platonism and ancient Neo @-@ Platonism , the works of Plotinus and Pseudo @-@ Dionysius the Areopagite , the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco 's style . Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue , José Álvarez <unk> , curator at the Museo del Prado , Madrid , concludes that the presence of " Byzantine memories " is obvious in El Greco 's mature works , though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination . 
 = = = Architecture and sculpture = = = 
 El Greco was highly esteemed as an architect and sculptor during his lifetime . He usually designed complete altar compositions , working as architect and sculptor as well as painter — at , for instance , the Hospital de la Caridad . There he decorated the chapel of the hospital , but the wooden altar and the sculptures he created have in all probability perished . For El <unk> the master designed the original altar of gilded wood which has been destroyed , but his small sculptured group of the Miracle of St. Ildefonso still survives on the lower center of the frame . 
 His most important architectural achievement was the church and Monastery of Santo Domingo el Antiguo , for which he also executed sculptures and paintings . El Greco is regarded as a painter who incorporated architecture in his painting . He is also credited with the architectural frames to his own paintings in Toledo . Pacheco characterized him as " a writer of painting , sculpture and architecture " . 
 In the marginalia that El Greco inscribed in his copy of Daniele Barbaro 's translation of Vitruvius ' De architectura , he refuted Vitruvius ' attachment to archaeological remains , canonical proportions , perspective and mathematics . He also saw Vitruvius ' manner of distorting proportions in order to compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms . El Greco was averse to the very idea of rules in architecture ; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty , variety , and complexity . These ideas were , however , far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 = = = Posthumous critical reputation = = = 
 El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th @-@ century Mannerism . El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers . Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works . Late 17th- and early 18th @-@ century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his <unk> style and his complex iconography . Some of these commentators , such as <unk> Antonio Palomino de Castro y Velasco and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez , described his mature work as " contemptible " , " ridiculous " and " worthy of scorn " . The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography , adorned with terms such as " strange " , " queer " , " original " , " eccentric " and " odd " . The phrase " sunk in eccentricity " , often encountered in such texts , in time developed into " madness " . 
 With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century , El Greco 's works were examined anew . To French writer Théophile Gautier , El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme . Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero ( the " gifted " , the " misunderstood " , the " mad " ) , and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco 's later technique . French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting . In the 1890s , Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor . However , in the popular English @-@ speaking imagination he remained the man who " painted horrors in the Escorial " in the words of Ephraim Chambers ' Cyclopaedia in 1899 . 
 In 1908 , Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé <unk> published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco 's works ; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School . The same year Julius Meier @-@ Graefe , a scholar of French Impressionism , traveled in Spain , expecting to study Velásquez , but instead becoming fascinated by El Greco ; he recorded his experiences in <unk> Reise ( Spanish Journey , published in English in 1926 ) , the book which widely established El Greco as a great painter of the past " outside a somewhat narrow circle " . In El Greco 's work , Meier @-@ Graefe found foreshadowing of modernity . These are the words Meier @-@ Graefe used to describe El Greco 's impact on the artistic movements of his time : 
 To the English artist and critic Roger Fry in 1920 , El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best " with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public " . Fry described El Greco as " an old master who is not merely modern , but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us , turning back to show us the way " . 
 During the same period , other researchers developed alternative , more radical theories . The ophthalmologists August Goldschmidt and Germán <unk> argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems ( possibly progressive astigmatism or strabismus ) that made him see bodies longer than they were , and at an angle to the perpendicular ; the physician Arturo Perera , however , attributed this style to the use of marijuana . Michael Kimmelman , a reviewer for The New York Times , stated that " to Greeks [ El Greco ] became the quintessential Greek painter ; to the Spanish , the quintessential Spaniard " . 
 As was proved by the campaign of the National Art Gallery in Athens to raise the funds for the purchase of Saint Peter in 1995 , El Greco is loved not just by experts and art lovers but also by ordinary people ; thanks to the donations mainly of individuals and public benefit foundations the National Art Gallery raised 1 @.@ 2 million dollars and purchased the painting . <unk> the consensus of El Greco 's impact , Jimmy Carter , the 39th President of the United States , said in April 1980 that El Greco was " the most extraordinary painter that ever came along back then " and that he was " maybe three or four centuries ahead of his time " . 
 = = = Influence on other artists = = = 
 El Greco 's re @-@ evaluation was not limited to scholars . According to <unk> <unk> , " painters and theoreticians from the beginning of the 20th century ' discovered ' a new El Greco but in process they also discovered and revealed their own selves " . His expressiveness and colors influenced Eugène Delacroix and Édouard Manet . To the Blaue Reiter group in Munich in 1912 , El Greco typified that mystical inner construction that it was the task of their generation to rediscover . The first painter who appears to have noticed the structural code in the morphology of the mature El Greco was Paul Cézanne , one of the forerunners of cubism . Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters revealed their common elements , such as the distortion of the human body , the reddish and ( in appearance only ) unworked backgrounds and the similarities in the rendering of space . According to Brown , " Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them " . Fry observed that Cézanne drew from " his great discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme " . 
 The Symbolists , and Pablo Picasso during his Blue Period , drew on the cold tonality of El Greco , utilizing the anatomy of his ascetic figures . While Picasso was working on Les Demoiselles d 'Avignon , he visited his friend Ignacio Zuloaga in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco 's Opening of the Fifth Seal ( owned by Zuloaga since 1897 ) . The relation between Les Demoiselles d 'Avignon and the Opening of the Fifth Seal was pinpointed in the early 1980s , when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs of both works were analysed . 
 The early cubist explorations of Picasso were to uncover other aspects in the work of El Greco : structural analysis of his compositions , multi @-@ faced refraction of form , interweaving of form and space , and special effects of highlights . Several traits of cubism , such as distortions and the materialistic rendering of time , have their analogies in El Greco 's work . According to Picasso , El Greco 's structure is cubist . On 22 February 1950 , Picasso began his series of " paraphrases " of other painters ' works with The Portrait of a Painter after El Greco . <unk> asserts that Picasso " completed ... the process for the activation of the painterly values of El Greco which had been started by Manet and carried on by Cézanne " . 
 The expressionists focused on the expressive distortions of El Greco . According to Franz Marc , one of the principal painters of the German expressionist movement , " we refer with pleasure and with steadfastness to the case of El Greco , because the glory of this painter is closely tied to the evolution of our new perceptions on art " . Jackson Pollock , a major force in the abstract expressionist movement , was also influenced by El Greco . By 1943 , Pollock had completed sixty drawing compositions after El Greco and owned three books on the Cretan master . 
 Contemporary painters are also inspired by El Greco 's art . <unk> Johnson used El Greco 's paintings of the Immaculate Conception as the compositional framework for some of her works , and the master 's anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut 's portraits . 
 El Greco 's personality and work were a source of inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke . One set of Rilke 's poems ( Himmelfahrt Mariae <unk> , 1913 ) was based directly on El Greco 's Immaculate Conception . Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis , who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco , called his autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute to the Cretan @-@ born artist . 
 In 1998 , the Greek electronic composer and artist Vangelis published El Greco , a symphonic album inspired by the artist . This album is an expansion of an earlier album by Vangelis , <unk> Timis Ston Greco ( A Tribute to El Greco , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . The life of the Cretan @-@ born artist is the subject of the film El Greco of Greek , Spanish and British production . Directed by Ioannis <unk> , the film began shooting in October 2006 on the island of Crete and debuted on the screen one year later ; British actor Nick <unk> has been cast to play El Greco . 
 = = Debates on attribution = = 
 The exact number of El Greco 's works has been a hotly contested issue . In 1937 , a highly influential study by art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini had the effect of greatly increasing the number of works accepted to be by El Greco . Pallucchini attributed to El Greco a small triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena on the basis of a signature on the painting on the back of the central panel on the Modena triptych ( " <unk> <unk> " , Created by the hand of Doménikos ) . There was consensus that the triptych was indeed an early work of El Greco and , therefore , Pallucchini 's publication became the yardstick for attributions to the artist . Nevertheless , Wethey denied that the Modena triptych had any connection at all with the artist and , in 1962 , produced a reactive catalogue raisonné with a greatly reduced corpus of materials . Whereas art historian José <unk> Aznar had attributed between 787 and 829 paintings to the Cretan master , Wethey reduced the number to 285 authentic works and <unk> <unk> , a German researcher of Spanish art , recognized only 137 . Wethey and other scholars rejected the notion that Crete took any part in his formation and supported the elimination of a series of works from El Greco 's oeuvre . 
 Since 1962 , the discovery of the Dormition and the extensive archival research has gradually convinced scholars that Wethey 's assessments were not entirely correct , and that his catalogue decisions may have distorted the perception of the whole nature of El Greco 's origins , development and oeuvre . The discovery of the Dormition led to the attribution of three other signed works of " <unk> " to El Greco ( Modena Triptych , St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child , and The Adoration of the Magi ) and then to the acceptance of more works as authentic — some signed , some not ( such as The Passion of Christ ( Pietà with Angels ) painted in 1566 ) , — which were brought into the group of early works of El Greco . El Greco is now seen as an artist with a formative training on Crete ; a series of works illuminate his early style , some painted while he was still on Crete , some from his period in Venice , and some from his subsequent stay in Rome . Even Wethey accepted that " he [ El Greco ] probably had painted the little and much disputed triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena before he left Crete " . Nevertheless , disputes over the exact number of El Greco 's authentic works remain unresolved , and the status of Wethey 's catalogue raisonné is at the center of these disagreements . 
 A few sculptures , including Epimetheus and Pandora , have been attributed to El Greco . This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco ( he saw in El Greco 's studio a series of figurines , but these may have been merely models ) . There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco ; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings , The Crucifixion . 
 = Film noir = 
 The film noir genre generally refers to mystery and crime dramas produced from the early 1940s to the late 1950s . Movies of this genre were characteristically shot in black and white , and featured stories involving femmes fatales , doomed heroes or anti @-@ heroes , and tough , cynical detectives . 
 The term film noir , French for " black film " ( literal ) or " dark film " ( closer meaning ) , first applied to Hollywood films by French critic Nino Frank in 1946 , was unrecognized by most American film industry professionals of that era . Cinema historians and critics defined the category retrospectively . Before the notion was widely adopted in the 1970s , many of the classic films noir were referred to as " melodramas " . Whether film noir qualifies as a distinct genre is a matter of ongoing debate among scholars . 
 Film noir encompasses a range of plots : the central figure may be a private eye ( The Big Sleep ) , a plainclothes policeman ( The Big Heat ) , an aging boxer ( The Set @-@ Up ) , a hapless grifter ( Night and the City ) , a law @-@ abiding citizen lured into a life of crime ( Gun Crazy ) , or simply a victim of circumstance ( D.O.A. ) . Although film noir was originally associated with American productions , films now so described have been made around the world . Many pictures released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noir of the classical period , and often treat its conventions self @-@ referentially . Some refer to such latter @-@ day works as neo @-@ noir . 
 = = Problems of definition = = 
 The questions of what defines film noir , and what sort of category it is , provoke continuing debate . " We 'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir <unk> , strange , erotic , ambivalent , and cruel [ … ] " — this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics Raymond Borde and Etienne <unk> in their 1955 book Panorama du film noir américain 1941 – 1953 ( A Panorama of American Film Noir ) , the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject . They emphasize that not every film noir embodies all five attributes in equal measure — one might be more dreamlike ; another , particularly brutal . The authors ' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship : in the more than five decades since , there have been innumerable further attempts at definition , yet in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould , film noir remains an " elusive phenomenon [ … ] always just out of reach " . 
 Though film noir is often identified with a visual style , unconventional within a Hollywood context , that emphasizes low @-@ key lighting and unbalanced compositions , films commonly identified as noir evidence a variety of visual approaches , including ones that fit comfortably within the Hollywood mainstream . Film noir similarly embraces a variety of genres , from the gangster film to the police procedural to the gothic romance to the social problem picture — any example of which from the 1940s and 1950s , now seen as noir 's classical era , was likely to be described as a " melodrama " at the time . 
 While many critics refer to film noir as a genre itself , others argue that it can be no such thing . While noir is often associated with an urban setting , many classic noirs take place in small towns , suburbia , rural areas , or on the open road ; so setting cannot be its genre determinant , as with the Western . Similarly , while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir , the majority of film noirs feature neither ; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film . Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film , the speculative leaps of the science fiction film , or the song @-@ and @-@ dance routines of the musical . 
 A more analogous case is that of the screwball comedy , widely accepted by film historians as constituting a " genre " : the screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute , but by a general disposition and a group of elements , some — but rarely and perhaps never all — of which are found in each of the genre 's films . However , because of the diversity of noir ( much greater than that of the screwball comedy ) , certain scholars in the field , such as film historian Thomas Schatz , treat it as not a genre but a " style " . Alain Silver , the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies , refers to film noir as a " cycle " and a " phenomenon " , even as he argues that it has — like certain genres — a consistent set of visual and thematic codes . Other critics treat film noir as a " mood " , characterize it as a " series " , or simply address a chosen set of films they regard as belonging to the noir " canon " . There is no consensus on the matter .

 Film noir 's aesthetics are deeply influenced by German Expressionism , an artistic movement of the 1910s and 1920s that involved theater , photography , painting , sculpture , and architecture , as well as cinema . The opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry , and , later , the threat of growing Nazi power , led to the emigration of many important film artists working in Germany who had either been directly involved in the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners . Fritz Lang 's M ( 1931 ) , shot only a few years before his departure from Germany , is among the first major crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir @-@ type plot , one in which the protagonist is a criminal ( as are his most successful pursuers ) . Directors such as Lang , Robert Siodmak , and Michael Curtiz brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach to visual composition , or mise @-@ en @-@ scène , with them to Hollywood , where they would make some of the most famous of classic noirs . 
 By 1931 , Curtiz had already been in Hollywood for half a decade , making as many as six films a year . Movies of his such as 20 @,@ 000 Years in Sing Sing ( 1932 ) and Private Detective 62 ( 1933 ) are among the early Hollywood sound films arguably classifiable as noir — scholar Marc Vernet offers the latter as evidence that dating the initiation of film noir to 1940 or any other year is " arbitrary " . Giving Expressionist @-@ affiliated filmmakers particularly free stylistic rein were Universal horror pictures such as Dracula ( 1931 ) , The Mummy ( 1932 ) — the former photographed and the latter directed by the Berlin @-@ trained Karl Freund — and The Black Cat ( 1934 ) , directed by Austrian émigré Edgar G. Ulmer . The Universal horror that comes closest to noir , both in story and sensibility , however , is The Invisible Man ( 1933 ) , directed by Englishman James Whale and photographed by American Arthur Edeson . Edeson would subsequently photograph The Maltese Falcon ( 1941 ) , widely regarded as the first major film noir of the classic era . 
 The Vienna @-@ born but largely American @-@ raised Josef von Sternberg was directing in Hollywood at the same time . Films of his such as Shanghai Express ( 1932 ) and The Devil Is a Woman ( 1935 ) , with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style , specifically anticipate central elements of classic noir . The commercial and critical success of Sternberg 's silent Underworld ( 1927 ) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films . Successful films in that genre such as Little Caesar ( 1931 ) , The Public Enemy ( 1931 ) , and Scarface ( 1932 ) demonstrated that there was an audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists . An important , and possibly influential , cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism , with its romantic , fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes . The movement 's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang ( 1932 ) , a key forerunner of noir . Among those films not themselves considered films noir , perhaps none had a greater effect on the development of the genre than Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) , directed by Orson Welles . Its visual intricacy and complex , voiceover @-@ driven narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic films noir . 
 Italian neorealism of the 1940s , with its emphasis on quasi @-@ documentary authenticity , was an acknowledged influence on trends that emerged in American noir . The Lost Weekend ( 1945 ) , directed by Billy Wilder , another Vienna @-@ born , Berlin @-@ trained American auteur , tells the story of an alcoholic in a manner evocative of neorealism . It also exemplifies the problem of classification : one of the first American films to be described as a film noir , it has largely disappeared from considerations of the field . Director Jules Dassin of The Naked City ( 1948 ) pointed to the <unk> as inspiring his use of on @-@ location photography with nonprofessional extras . This <unk> approach characterized a substantial number of noirs in the late 1940s and early 1950s . Along with neorealism , the style had a homegrown precedent , specifically cited by Dassin , in director Henry Hathaway 's The House on 92nd Street ( 1945 ) , which demonstrated the parallel influence of the cinematic newsreel . 
 = = = Literary sources = = = 
 The primary literary influence on film noir was the hardboiled school of American detective and crime fiction , led in its early years by such writers as Dashiell Hammett ( whose first novel , Red Harvest , was published in 1929 ) and James M. Cain ( whose The Postman Always Rings Twice appeared five years later ) , and popularized in pulp magazines such as Black Mask . The classic film noirs The Maltese Falcon ( 1941 ) and The Glass Key ( 1942 ) were based on novels by Hammett ; Cain 's novels provided the basis for Double Indemnity ( 1944 ) , Mildred Pierce ( 1945 ) , The Postman Always Rings Twice ( 1946 ) , and Slightly Scarlet ( 1956 ; adapted from Love 's Lovely Counterfeit ) . A decade before the classic era , a story by Hammett was the source for the gangster melodrama City Streets ( 1931 ) , directed by Rouben Mamoulian and photographed by Lee Garmes , who worked regularly with Sternberg . Wedding a style and story both with many noir characteristics , released the month before Lang 's M , City Streets has a claim to being the first major film noir . 
 Raymond Chandler , who debuted as a novelist with The Big Sleep in 1939 , soon became the most famous author of the hardboiled school . Not only were Chandler 's novels turned into major noirs — Murder , My Sweet ( 1944 ; adapted from Farewell , My Lovely ) , The Big Sleep ( 1946 ) , and Lady in the Lake ( 1947 ) — he was an important screenwriter in the genre as well , producing the scripts for Double Indemnity , The Blue Dahlia ( 1946 ) , and Strangers on a Train ( 1951 ) . Where Chandler , like Hammett , centered most of his novels and stories on the character of the private eye , Cain featured less heroic protagonists and focused more on psychological exposition than on crime solving ; the Cain approach has come to be identified with a subset of the hardboiled genre dubbed " noir fiction " . 
 For much of the 1940s , one of the most prolific and successful authors of this often downbeat brand of suspense tale was Cornell Woolrich ( sometimes under the pseudonym George Hopley or William Irish ) . No writer 's published work provided the basis for more films noir of the classic period than Woolrich 's : thirteen in all , including Black Angel ( 1946 ) , Deadline at Dawn ( 1946 ) , and Fear in the Night ( 1947 ) . 
 Another crucial literary source for film noir was W. R. Burnett , whose first novel to be published was Little Caesar , in 1929 . It would be turned into a hit for Warner Bros. in 1931 ; the following year , Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface , while The Beast of the City ( 1932 ) was adapted from one of his stories . At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date . Burnett 's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots — his protagonists were often heroic in their way , a way just happening to be that of the gangster . During the classic era , his work , either as author or screenwriter , was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir , including three of the most famous : High Sierra ( 1941 ) , This Gun for Hire ( 1942 ) , and The Asphalt Jungle ( 1950 ) .

 The 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the " classic period " of American film noir . While City Streets and other pre @-@ WWII crime melodramas such as Fury ( 1936 ) and You Only Live Once ( 1937 ) , both directed by Fritz Lang , are categorized as full @-@ fledged noir in Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward 's film noir encyclopedia , other critics tend to describe them as " proto @-@ noir " or in similar terms . The film now most commonly cited as the first " true " film noir is Stranger on the Third Floor ( 1940 ) , directed by Latvian @-@ born , Soviet @-@ trained Boris <unk> . Hungarian émigré Peter Lorre — who had starred in Lang 's M — was top @-@ billed , though he did not play the lead . He would play secondary roles in several other formative American noirs . Though modestly budgeted , at the high end of the B movie scale , Stranger on the Third Floor still lost its studio , RKO , $ 56 @,@ 000 , almost a third of its total cost . Variety magazine found <unk> 's work " too studied and when original , lacks the flare to hold attention . It 's a film too arty for average audiences , and too humdrum for others . " Stranger on the Third Floor was not recognized as the beginning of a trend , let alone a new genre , for many decades . 
 Most of the films noir of the classic period were similarly low- and modestly budgeted features without major stars — B movies either literally or in spirit . In this production context , writers , directors , cinematographers , and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big @-@ picture constraints . There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole : the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi @-@ documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies . Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non @-@ noir commercial productions . In terms of content , enforcement of the Production Code ensured that no film character could literally get away with murder or be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse ; within those bounds , however , many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqué for the time . 
 Thematically , films noir were most exceptional for the relative frequency with which they centered on women of questionable virtue — a focus that had become rare in Hollywood films after the mid @-@ 1930s and the end of the pre @-@ Code era . The signal film in this vein was Double Indemnity , directed by Billy Wilder ; setting the mold was Barbara Stanwyck 's unforgettable femme fatale , Phyllis Dietrichson — an apparent nod to Marlene Dietrich , who had built her extraordinary career playing such characters for Sternberg . An A @-@ level feature all the way , the film 's commercial success and seven Oscar nominations made it probably the most influential of the early noirs . A slew of now @-@ renowned noir " bad girls " would follow , such as those played by Rita Hayworth in Gilda ( 1946 ) , Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice ( 1946 ) , Ava Gardner in The Killers ( 1946 ) , and Jane Greer in Out of the Past ( 1947 ) . The iconic noir counterpart to the femme fatale , the private eye , came to the fore in films such as The Maltese Falcon ( 1941 ) , with Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade , and Murder , My Sweet ( 1944 ) , with Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe . Other seminal noir sleuths served larger institutions , such as Dana Andrews ' police detective in Laura ( 1944 ) , Edmond O 'Brien 's insurance investigator in The Killers , and Edward G. Robinson 's government agent in The Stranger ( 1946 ) . 
 The prevalence of the private eye as a lead character declined in film noir of the 1950s , a period during which several critics describe the form as becoming more focused on extreme psychologies and more exaggerated in general . A prime example is Kiss Me Deadly ( 1955 ) ; based on a novel by Mickey Spillane , the best @-@ selling of all the hardboiled authors , here the protagonist is a private eye , Mike Hammer . As described by Paul Schrader , " Robert Aldrich 's teasing direction carries noir to its sleaziest and most perversely erotic . Hammer overturns the underworld in search of the ' great <unk> ' [ which ] turns out to be — joke of jokes — an exploding atomic bomb . " Orson Welles 's <unk> styled Touch of Evil ( 1958 ) is frequently cited as the last noir of the classic period . Some scholars believe film noir never really ended , but continued to transform even as the characteristic noir visual style began to seem dated and changing production conditions led Hollywood in different directions — in this view , post @-@ 1950s films in the noir tradition are seen as part of a continuity with classic noir . A majority of critics , however , regard comparable films made outside the classic era to be something other than genuine film noirs . They regard true film noir as belonging to a temporally and geographically limited cycle or period , treating subsequent films that evoke the classics as fundamentally different due to general shifts in filmmaking style and latter @-@ day awareness of noir as a historical source for allusion . 
 = = = Directors and the business of noir = = = 
 While the <unk> noir , Stranger on the Third Floor , was a B picture directed by a virtual unknown , many of the films noir still remembered were A @-@ list productions by well @-@ known film makers . Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon ( 1941 ) , John Huston followed with Key Largo ( 1948 ) and The Asphalt Jungle ( 1950 ) . Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era ; at least four qualify by consensus : Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) , Notorious ( 1946 ) , Strangers on a Train ( 1951 ) and The Wrong Man ( 1956 ) . Otto Preminger 's success with Laura ( 1944 ) made his name and helped demonstrate noir 's adaptability to a high @-@ gloss 20th Century @-@ Fox presentation . Among Hollywood 's most celebrated directors of the era , arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger ; his other noirs include Fallen Angel ( 1945 ) , Whirlpool ( 1949 ) , Where the Sidewalk Ends ( 1950 ) ( all for Fox ) and Angel Face ( 1952 ) . A half @-@ decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend , Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard ( 1950 ) and Ace in the Hole ( 1951 ) , noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media . In a Lonely Place ( 1950 ) was Nicholas Ray 's breakthrough ; his other noirs include his debut , They Live by Night ( 1948 ) and On Dangerous Ground ( 1952 ) , noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream . 
 Orson Welles had notorious problems with financing but his three film noirs were well budgeted : The Lady from Shanghai ( 1947 ) received top @-@ level , " prestige " backing , while The Stranger , his most conventional film and Touch of Evil , an unmistakably personal work , were funded at levels lower but still commensurate with headlining releases . Like The Stranger , Fritz Lang 's The Woman in the Window ( 1945 ) was a production of the independent International Pictures . Lang 's follow @-@ up , Scarlet Street ( 1945 ) , was one of the few classic noirs to be officially censored : filled with erotic innuendo , it was temporarily banned in Milwaukee , Atlanta and New York State . Scarlet Street was a semi @-@ independent , cosponsored by Universal and Lang 's Diana Productions , of which the film 's co @-@ star , Joan Bennett , was the second biggest shareholder . Lang , Bennett and her husband , the Universal veteran and Diana production head Walter Wanger , made Secret Beyond the Door ( 1948 ) in similar fashion . 
 Before he was forced abroad by political persecution , Jules Dassin made two classic noirs that also straddled the major – independent line : Brute Force ( 1947 ) and the influential documentary @-@ style The Naked City were developed by producer Mark Hellinger , who had an " inside / outside " contract with Universal similar to Wanger 's . Years earlier , working at Warner Bros. , Hellinger had produced three films for Raoul Walsh , the proto @-@ noirs They Drive by Night ( 1940 ) , Manpower ( 1941 ) and High Sierra ( 1941 ) , now regarded as a seminal work in noir 's development . Walsh had no great name during his half @-@ century as a director but his noirs White Heat ( 1949 ) and The Enforcer ( 1951 ) had A @-@ list stars and are seen as important examples of the cycle . Other directors associated with top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ bill Hollywood film noirs include Edward Dmytryk ( Murder , My Sweet [ 1944 ] , Crossfire [ 1947 ] ) — the first important noir director to fall prey to the industry blacklist — as well as Henry Hathaway ( The Dark Corner [ 1946 ] , Kiss of Death [ 1947 ] ) and John Farrow ( The Big Clock [ 1948 ] , Night Has a Thousand Eyes [ 1948 ] ) . 
 Most of the Hollywood films considered to be classic noirs , fall into the category of " B movie " . Some were Bs in the most precise sense , produced to run on the bottom of double bills by a low @-@ budget unit of one of the major studios or by one of the smaller Poverty Row outfits , from the relatively well @-@ off Monogram to <unk> ventures such as Producers Releasing Corporation ( PRC ) . Jacques Tourneur had made over thirty Hollywood Bs ( a few now highly regarded , most forgotten ) before directing the A @-@ level Out of the Past , described by scholar Robert Ottoson as " the ne plus ultra of forties film noir " . Movies with budgets a step up the ladder , known as " intermediates " by the industry , might be treated as A or B pictures depending on the circumstances . Monogram created Allied Artists in the late 1940s to focus on this sort of production . Such films have long been colloquially known as B movies . Robert Wise ( Born to Kill [ 1947 ] , The Set @-@ Up [ 1949 ] ) and Anthony Mann ( T @-@ Men [ 1947 ] and Raw Deal [ 1948 ] ) each made a series of impressive intermediates , many of them noirs , before graduating to steady work on big @-@ budget productions . Mann did some of his most celebrated work with cinematographer John Alton , a specialist in what James Naremore called " hypnotic moments of light @-@ in @-@ darkness " . He Walked by Night ( 1948 ) , shot by Alton and though credited solely to Alfred <unk> , directed in large part by Mann , demonstrates their technical mastery and exemplifies the late 1940s trend of " police procedural " crime dramas . Put out , like other Mann @-@ Alton noirs , by the small Eagle @-@ Lion company , it was the inspiration for the Dragnet series , which debuted on radio in 1949 and television in 1951 . 
 Several directors associated with noir built well @-@ respected oeuvres largely at the B @-@ movie / intermediate level . Samuel Fuller 's brutal , visually energetic films such as Pickup on South Street ( 1953 ) and Underworld U.S.A. ( 1961 ) earned him a unique reputation ; his advocates praise him as " primitive " and " barbarous " . Joseph H. Lewis directed noirs as diverse as Gun Crazy ( 1950 ) and The Big Combo ( 1955 ) . The former — whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo , disguised by a front — features a bank hold @-@ up sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential . The Big Combo was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits . The most distinctive films of Phil <unk> ( The Phenix City Story [ 1955 ] and The Brothers Rico [ 1957 ] ) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale . The work of other directors in this tier of the industry , such as Felix E. Feist ( The Devil Thumbs a Ride [ 1947 ] , Tomorrow Is Another Day [ 1951 ] ) , has become obscure . Edgar G. Ulmer spent most of his Hollywood career working at B studios and once in a while on projects that achieved intermediate status ; for the most part , on unmistakable Bs . In 1945 , while at PRC , he directed a noir cult classic , Detour . Ulmer 's other noirs include Strange Illusion ( 1945 ) , also for PRC ; Ruthless ( 1948 ) , for Eagle @-@ Lion , which had acquired PRC the previous year and Murder Is My Beat ( 1955 ) , for Allied Artists . 
 A number of low- and modestly @-@ budgeted noirs were made by independent , often actor @-@ owned , companies contracting with larger studios for distribution . Serving as producer , writer , director and top @-@ billed performer , Hugo Haas made films like Pickup ( 1951 ) and The Other Woman ( 1954 ) . It was in this way that accomplished noir actress Ida Lupino established herself as the sole female director in Hollywood during the late 1940s and much of the 1950s . She does not appear in the best @-@ known film she directed , The Hitch @-@ Hiker ( 1953 ) , developed by her company , The Filmakers , with support and distribution by RKO . It is one of the seven classic film noirs produced largely outside of the major studios that have been chosen for the United States National Film Registry . Of the others , one was a small @-@ studio release : Detour . Four were independent productions distributed by United Artists , the " studio without a studio " : Gun Crazy ; Kiss Me Deadly ; D.O.A. ( 1950 ) , directed by Rudolph Maté and Sweet Smell of Success ( 1957 ) , directed by Alexander Mackendrick . One was an independent distributed by MGM , the industry leader : Force of Evil ( 1948 ) , directed by Abraham Polonsky and starring John Garfield , both of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s . Independent production usually meant restricted circumstances but Sweet Smell of Success , despite the plans of the production team , was clearly not made on the cheap , though like many other cherished A @-@ budget noirs , it might be said to have a B @-@ movie soul . 
 Perhaps no director better displayed that spirit than the German @-@ born Robert Siodmak , who had already made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood . Working mostly on A features , he made eight films now regarded as classic @-@ era film noirs ( a figure matched only by Lang and Mann ) . In addition to The Killers , Burt Lancaster 's debut and a Hellinger / Universal co @-@ production , Siodmak 's other important contributions to the genre include 1944 's Phantom Lady ( a top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line B and Woolrich adaptation ) , the ironically titled Christmas Holiday ( 1944 ) , and Cry of the City ( 1948 ) . Criss Cross ( 1949 ) , with Lancaster again the lead , exemplifies how Siodmak brought the virtues of the B @-@ movie to the A noir . In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets , the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons : dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets ( mist and smoke also served the cause ) ; night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules ; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts , of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene . In Criss Cross , Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose , wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo , playing the most understandable of femme fatales , Dan Duryea , in one of his many charismatic villain roles and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber , doomed by a romantic obsession .

 Although the term " film noir " was originally coined to describe Hollywood movies , film noir was an international phenomenon . Even before the beginning of the generally accepted classic period , there were films made far from Hollywood that can be seen in retrospect as film noirs , for example , the French productions <unk> le Moko ( 1937 ) , directed by Julien Duvivier , and Le Jour se <unk> ( 1939 ) , directed by Marcel Carné . In addition , Mexico experienced a vibrant film noir period from roughly 1946 to 1952 , around the same time film noir was blossoming in the U.S. 
 During the classic period , there were are many films produced in Europe , particularly in France , that share elements of style , theme , and sensibility with American film noirs and may themselves be included in the genre 's canon . In certain cases , the interrelationship with Hollywood noir is obvious : American @-@ born director Jules Dassin moved to France in the early 1950s as a result of the Hollywood blacklist , and made one of the most famous French film noirs , Rififi ( 1955 ) . Other well @-@ known French films often classified as noir include Quai des Orfèvres ( 1947 ) and Les Diaboliques ( 1955 ) , both directed by Henri @-@ Georges Clouzot ; <unk> d 'Or ( 1952 ) and <unk> pas au <unk> ( 1954 ) , both directed by Jacques Becker ; and <unk> pour l <unk> ( 1958 ) , directed by Louis Malle . French director Jean @-@ Pierre Melville is widely recognized for his tragic , minimalist film noirs — Bob le <unk> ( 1955 ) , from the classic period , was followed by Le Doulos ( 1962 ) , Le <unk> souffle ( 1966 ) , Le Samouraï ( 1967 ) , and Le Cercle rouge ( 1970 ) . 
 Scholar Andrew Spicer argues that British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism than to the expressionistic American mode of noir . Examples of British noir from the classic period include Brighton Rock ( 1947 ) , directed by John Boulting ; They Made Me a Fugitive ( 1947 ) , directed by Alberto Cavalcanti ; The Small Back Room ( 1948 ) , directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger ; The October Man ( 1950 ) , directed by Roy Ward Baker ; and Cast a Dark Shadow ( 1955 ) , directed by Lewis Gilbert . Terence Fisher directed several low @-@ budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions , including The Last Page ( a.k.a. Man Bait ; 1952 ) , Stolen Face ( 1952 ) , and Murder by Proxy ( a.k.a. Blackout ; 1954 ) . Before leaving for France , Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English @-@ language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain : Night and the City ( 1950 ) . Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors — Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney — it is technically a UK production , financed by 20th Century @-@ Fox 's British subsidiary . The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed 's The Third Man ( 1949 ) , from a screenplay by Graham Greene . Set in Vienna immediately after World War II , it also stars two American actors , Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles , who had appeared together in Citizen Kane . 
 Elsewhere , Italian director Luchino Visconti adapted Cain 's The Postman Always Rings Twice as <unk> ( 1943 ) , regarded both as one of the great noirs and a seminal film in the development of neorealism . ( This was not even the first screen version of Cain 's novel , having been preceded by the French Le Dernier <unk> in 1939 . ) In Japan , the celebrated Akira Kurosawa directed several films recognizable as film noirs , including Drunken Angel ( 1948 ) , Stray Dog ( 1949 ) , The Bad Sleep Well ( 1960 ) , and High and Low ( 1963 ) . 
 Among the first major neo @-@ noir films — the term often applied to films that consciously refer back to the classic noir tradition — was the French <unk> sur le <unk> ( 1960 ) , directed by François Truffaut from a novel by one of the gloomiest of American noir fiction writers , David Goodis . Noir crime films and melodramas have been produced in many countries in the post @-@ classic area . Some of these are quintessentially self @-@ aware neo @-@ noirs — for example , Il <unk> ( 1969 ; Italy ) , Der Amerikanische Freund ( 1977 ; Germany ) , The Element of Crime ( 1984 ; Denmark ) , As Tears Go By ( 1988 ; Hong Kong ) , and El Aura ( 2005 ; Argentina ) . Others simply share narrative elements and a version of the hardboiled sensibility associated with classic noir , such as The Castle of Sand ( 1974 ; Japan ) , Insomnia ( 1997 ; Norway ) , <unk> ( 1998 ; UK ) , Blind Shaft ( 2003 ; China ) , and The Square ( 2008 ; Australia ) .

 The neo @-@ noir film genre developed mid @-@ way into the Cold War . This <unk> trend reflected much of the cynicism and the possibility of nuclear annihilation of the era . This new genre introduced innovations that were not available with the earlier noir films . The violence was also more potent than in earlier noir films . 
 = = = 1960s and 1970s = = = 
 While it is hard to draw a line between some of the noir films of the early 1960s such as Blast of Silence ( 1961 ) and Cape Fear ( 1962 ) and the noirs of the late 1950s , new trends emerged in the post @-@ classic era . The Manchurian Candidate ( 1962 ) , directed by John Frankenheimer , Shock Corridor ( 1962 ) , directed by Samuel Fuller , and Brainstorm ( 1965 ) , directed by experienced noir character actor William Conrad , all treat the theme of mental dispossession within stylistic and tonal frameworks derived from classic film noir . The Manchurian Candidate examined the situation of American prisoners of war ( POWs ) during the Korean War . These incidents that occurred during the war as well as post @-@ war incidents that ensued , functioned as an inspiration for a different " subgenre of Cold War Noir " . The television series The Fugitive ( 1963 – 67 ) brought classic noir themes and mood to the small screen for an extended run . 
 In a different vein , films began to appear that self @-@ consciously acknowledged the conventions of classic film noir as historical archetypes to be revived , rejected , or reimagined . These efforts typify what came to be known as neo @-@ noir . Though several late classic noirs , Kiss Me Deadly in particular , were deeply self @-@ knowing and post @-@ traditional in conception , none tipped its hand so evidently as to be remarked on by American critics at the time . The first major film to overtly work this angle was French director Jean @-@ Luc Godard 's À bout de souffle ( Breathless ; 1960 ) , which pays its literal respects to Bogart and his crime films while brandishing a bold new style for a new day . In the United States , Arthur Penn ( Mickey One [ 1964 ] , drawing inspiration from Truffaut 's <unk> sur le <unk> and other French New Wave films ) , John Boorman ( Point Blank [ 1967 ] , similarly caught up , though in the Nouvelle vague 's deeper waters ) , and Alan J. Pakula ( Klute [ 1971 ] ) directed films that knowingly related themselves to the original film noirs , inviting audiences in on the game . 
 A manifest affiliation with noir traditions — which , by its nature , allows different sorts of commentary on them to be inferred — can also provide the basis for explicit critiques of those traditions . In 1973 , director Robert Altman flipped off noir piety with The Long Goodbye . Based on the novel by Raymond Chandler , it features one of Bogart 's most famous characters , but in iconoclastic fashion : Philip Marlowe , the prototypical hardboiled detective , is replayed as a hapless misfit , almost laughably out of touch with contemporary mores and morality . Where Altman 's subversion of the film noir mythos was so irreverent as to outrage some contemporary critics , around the same time Woody Allen was paying affectionate , at points idolatrous homage to the classic mode with Play It Again , Sam ( 1972 ) . The " blaxploitation " film Shaft ( 1971 ) , wherein Richard Roundtree plays the titular African @-@ American private eye , John Shaft , takes conventions from classic noir . 
 The most acclaimed of the neo @-@ noirs of the era was director Roman Polanski 's 1974 Chinatown . Written by Robert Towne , it is set in 1930s Los Angeles , an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years in a way that makes the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler . Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward , director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude crashing into the present day with Taxi Driver ( 1976 ) , a crackling , bloody @-@ minded gloss on bicentennial America . In 1978 , Walter Hill wrote and directed The Driver , a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean @-@ Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood . 
 Hill was already a central figure in 1970s noir of a more straightforward manner , having written the script for director Sam Peckinpah 's The Getaway ( 1972 ) , adapting a novel by pulp master Jim Thompson , as well as for two tough private eye films : an original screenplay for Hickey & Boggs ( 1972 ) and an adaptation of a novel by Ross Macdonald , the leading literary descendant of Hammett and Chandler , for The Drowning Pool ( 1975 ) . Some of the strongest 1970s noirs , in fact , were unwinking remakes of the classics , " neo " mostly by default : the heartbreaking Thieves Like Us ( 1973 ) , directed by Altman from the same source as Ray 's They Live by Night , and Farewell , My Lovely ( 1975 ) , the Chandler tale made classically as Murder , My Sweet , remade here with Robert Mitchum in his last notable noir role . Detective series , prevalent on American television during the period , updated the hardboiled tradition in different ways , but the show conjuring the most noir tone was a horror crossover touched with shaggy , Long Goodbye – style humor : Kolchak : The Night Stalker ( 1974 – 75 ) , featuring a Chicago newspaper reporter investigating strange , usually supernatural occurrences . 
 = = = 1980s and 1990s = = = 
 The turn of the decade brought Scorsese 's black @-@ and @-@ white Raging Bull ( cowritten by Schrader ) ; an acknowledged masterpiece — the American Film Institute ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time — it is also a retreat , telling a story of a boxer 's moral self @-@ destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as Body and Soul ( 1947 ) and Champion ( 1949 ) . From 1981 , the popular Body Heat , written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan , invokes a different set of classic noir elements , this time in a humid , erotically charged Florida setting ; its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo @-@ noir , at a time when the major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse . The mainstreaming of neo @-@ noir is evident in such films as Black Widow ( 1987 ) , Shattered ( 1991 ) , and Final Analysis ( 1992 ) . Few neo @-@ noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double @-@ entendre than Basic Instinct ( 1992 ) , directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe <unk> . The film also demonstrates how neo @-@ noir 's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black @-@ and @-@ white noir . Poison Ivy ( 1992 ) makes use of similar devices executed in Basic Instinct , including a shady , seductive femme @-@ fatale with ulterior motives . 
 Among big @-@ budget auteurs , Michael Mann has worked frequently in a neo @-@ noir mode , with such films as Thief ( 1981 ) and Heat ( 1995 ) and the TV series Miami Vice ( 1984 – 89 ) and Crime Story ( 1986 – 88 ) . Mann 's output exemplifies a primary strain of neo @-@ noir , in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary setting with an up @-@ to @-@ date visual style and rock- or hip hop – based musical soundtrack . Like Chinatown , its more complex predecessor , Curtis Hanson 's Oscar @-@ winning L.A. Confidential ( 1997 ) , based on the James Ellroy novel , demonstrates an opposite tendency — the deliberately retro film noir ; its tale of corrupt cops and femmes fatales is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953 , the year in which it is set . Director David Fincher followed the immensely successful neo @-@ noir Seven ( 1995 ) with a film that developed into a cult favorite after its original , disappointing release : Fight Club ( 1999 ) is a sui generis mix of noir aesthetic , perverse comedy , speculative content , and satiric intent . 
 Working generally with much smaller budgets , brothers Joel and Ethan Coen have created one of the most extensive film oeuvres influenced by classic noir , with films such as Blood Simple ( 1984 ) and Fargo ( 1996 ) , considered by some a supreme work in the neo @-@ noir mode . The Coens cross noir with other generic lines in the gangster drama Miller 's Crossing ( 1990 ) — loosely based on the Dashiell Hammett novels Red Harvest and The Glass Key — and the comedy The Big Lebowski ( 1998 ) , a tribute to Chandler and an homage to Altman 's version of The Long Goodbye . The characteristic work of David Lynch combines film noir tropes with scenarios driven by disturbed characters such as the sociopathic criminal played by Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet ( 1986 ) and the <unk> protagonist of Lost Highway ( 1997 ) . The Twin Peaks cycle , both TV series ( 1990 – 91 ) and film , Fire Walk with Me ( 1992 ) , puts a detective plot through a succession of bizarre spasms . David Cronenberg also mixes surrealism and noir in Naked Lunch ( 1991 ) , inspired by the William S. Burroughs novel . 
 Perhaps no American neo @-@ noirs better reflect the classic noir A @-@ movie @-@ with @-@ a @-@ B @-@ movie @-@ soul than those of director @-@ writer Quentin Tarantino ; neo @-@ noirs of his such as Reservoir Dogs ( 1992 ) and Pulp Fiction ( 1994 ) display a relentlessly self @-@ reflexive , sometimes tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek sensibility , similar to the work of the New Wave directors and the Coens . Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo @-@ noir ( some retro , some more au courant ) include director John Dahl 's Kill Me Again ( 1989 ) , Red Rock West ( 1992 ) , The Last Seduction ( 1993 ) , To Die For ( 1995 ) , and A Perfect Murder ( 1998 ) ; four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson — The Kill @-@ Off ( 1989 ) , After Dark , My Sweet ( 1990 ) , The Grifters ( 1990 ) , and the remake of The Getaway ( 1994 ) ; and many more , including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers : The Hot Spot ( 1990 ) , from Hell Hath No Fury , by Charles Williams ; Miami Blues ( 1990 ) , from the novel by Charles <unk> ; and Out of Sight ( 1998 ) , from the novel by Elmore Leonard . Several films by director @-@ writer David Mamet involve noir elements : House of Games ( 1987 ) , Homicide ( 1991 ) , The Spanish Prisoner ( 1997 ) , and Heist ( 2001 ) . On television , Remington Steele ( 1982 – 87 ) and Moonlighting ( 1985 – 89 ) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle . Between 1983 and 1989 , Mickey Spillane 's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand @-@ alone television films ( an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997 – 98 ) . The British miniseries The Singing Detective ( 1986 ) , written by Dennis Potter , tells the story of a mystery writer named Philip Marlow ; widely considered one of the finest neo @-@ noirs in any medium , some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time .

 The Coens referenced the noir tradition again with The Man Who Wasn 't There ( 2001 ) ; a black @-@ and @-@ white crime melodrama set in 1949 , it features a scene apparently staged to mirror the one from Out of the Past pictured above . Lynch 's Mulholland Drive ( 2001 ) continued in his characteristic vein , making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir @-@ inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle . British @-@ born director Christopher Nolan 's black @-@ and @-@ white debut , Following ( 1998 ) , was an overt homage to classic noir . During the new century 's first decade , he was one of the leading Hollywood directors of neo @-@ noir with the acclaimed Memento ( 2000 ) and the remake of Insomnia ( 2002 ) . 
 Director Sean Penn 's The Pledge ( 2001 ) , though adapted from a very self @-@ reflexive novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt , plays noir comparatively straight , to devastating effect . Screenwriter David Ayer updated the classic noir bad @-@ cop tale , typified by Shield for Murder ( 1954 ) and Rogue Cop ( 1954 ) , with his scripts for Training Day ( 2001 ) and , adapting a story by James Ellroy , Dark Blue ( 2002 ) ; he later wrote and directed the even darker Harsh Times ( 2006 ) . Michael Mann 's Collateral ( 2004 ) features a performance by Tom Cruise as an assassin in the lineage of Le Samouraï . The torments of The Machinist ( 2004 ) , directed by Brad Anderson , evoke both Fight Club and Memento . In 2005 , Shane Black directed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang , basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by Brett Halliday , who published his first stories back in the 1920s . The film plays with an awareness not only of classic noir but also of neo @-@ noir reflexivity itself . 
 With ultra @-@ violent films such as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance ( 2002 ) and Thirst ( 2009 ) , Park Chan @-@ wook of South Korea has been the most prominent director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium . The most commercially successful neo @-@ noir of this period has been Sin City ( 2005 ) , directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color . The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller ( credited as the film 's <unk> ) , which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors . Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit ( 2008 ) . This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner . Similarly , graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition ( 2002 ) , directed by Sam Mendes , and A History of Violence ( 2005 ) , directed by David Cronenberg ; the latter was voted best film of the year in the annual Village Voice poll . Writer @-@ director Rian Johnson 's Brick ( 2005 ) , featuring present @-@ day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot , won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival . The television series Veronica Mars ( 2004 – 7 ) also brought a youth @-@ oriented twist to film noir . Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed teen noir . 
 Classical neo @-@ noir examples in the 2010s include Kim Jee @-@ <unk> ’ s I Saw the Devil ( 2010 ) , Fred <unk> ’ s Point Blank ( 2010 ) , Na Hong @-@ jin ’ s The Yellow Sea ( 2010 ) and Nicolas Winding Refn ’ s Drive ( 2011 ) .

 In the post @-@ classic era , a significant trend in noir crossovers has involved science fiction . In Jean @-@ Luc Godard 's Alphaville ( 1965 ) , Lemmy Caution is the name of the old @-@ school private eye in the city of tomorrow . The <unk> Conspiracy ( 1972 ) centers on another implacable investigator and an amnesiac named Welles . Soylent Green ( 1973 ) , the first major American example , portrays a dystopian , near @-@ future world via a self @-@ evidently noir detection plot ; starring Charlton Heston ( the lead in Touch of Evil ) , it also features classic noir standbys Joseph Cotten , Edward G. Robinson , and Whit Bissell . The film was directed by Richard Fleischer , who two decades before had directed several strong B noirs , including Armored Car Robbery ( 1950 ) and The Narrow Margin ( 1952 ) . 
 The cynical and stylish perspective of classic film noir had a formative effect on the cyberpunk genre of science fiction that emerged in the early 1980s ; the film most directly influential on cyberpunk was Blade Runner ( 1982 ) , directed by Ridley Scott , which pays evocative homage to the classic noir mode ( Scott would subsequently direct the poignant noir crime melodrama Someone to Watch Over Me [ 1987 ] ) . Scholar Jamaluddin Bin Aziz has observed how " the shadow of Philip Marlowe lingers on " in such other " future noir " films as 12 Monkeys ( 1995 ) , Dark City ( 1998 ) and Minority Report ( 2002 ) . Fincher 's feature debut was Alien 3 ( 1992 ) , which evoked the classic noir jail film Brute Force . 
 David Cronenberg 's Crash ( 1996 ) , an adaptation of the speculative novel by J. G. Ballard , has been described as a " film noir in bruise tones " . The hero is the target of investigation in Gattaca ( 1997 ) , which fuses film noir motifs with a scenario indebted to Brave New World . The Thirteenth Floor ( 1999 ) , like Blade Runner , is an explicit homage to classic noir , in this case involving speculations about virtual reality . The Animatrix ( 2003 ) , based on the The Matrix trilogy , contains an anime short film in classic noir style titled " A Detective Story " which takes place within the story of the trilogy . Anime television series with science fiction noir themes include Ghost in the Shell , Cowboy Bebop ( 1998 ) , The Big O ( 1999 ) , and Noir ( 2001 ) . 
 The 2015 film Ex Machina puts a film noir spin on the Frankenstein mythos , with the femme fatale sentient android Ava manipulating outsider Caleb to perform a crime against her creator Nathan . 
 = = Parodies = = 
 Film noir has been parodied many times , in many manners . In 1945 , Danny Kaye starred in what appears to be the first intentional film noir parody , Wonder Man . That same year , Deanna Durbin was the singing lead in the comedic noir Lady on a Train , which makes fun of Woolrich @-@ brand wistful <unk> . Bob Hope inaugurated the private @-@ eye noir parody with My Favorite Brunette ( 1947 ) , playing a baby @-@ photographer who is mistaken for an <unk> detective . In 1947 as well , The Bowery Boys appeared in Hard Boiled Mahoney , which had a similar mistaken @-@ identity plot ; they spoofed the genre once more in Private Eyes ( 1953 ) . Two RKO productions starring Robert Mitchum take film noir over the border into self @-@ parody : The Big Steal ( 1949 ) , directed by Don Siegel , and His Kind of Woman ( 1951 ) . The " Girl Hunt " ballet in Vincente Minnelli 's The Band Wagon ( 1953 ) is a ten @-@ minute distillation of — and play on — noir in dance . The Cheap Detective ( 1978 ) , starring Peter Falk , is a broad spoof of several films , including the Bogart classics The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca . Carl Reiner 's black @-@ and @-@ white Dead Men Don 't Wear Plaid ( 1982 ) appropriates clips of classic noirs for a farcical pastiche , while his Fatal Instinct ( 1993 ) sends up noirs both classic ( Double Indemnity ) and neo ( Basic Instinct ) . Robert Zemeckis 's Who Framed Roger Rabbit ( 1988 ) develops a noir plot set in 1940s L.A. around a host of cartoon characters . 
 Noir parodies come in darker tones as well . Murder by Contract ( 1958 ) , directed by Irving Lerner , is a deadpan joke on noir , with a denouement as bleak as any of the films it kids . An ultra @-@ low @-@ budget Columbia Pictures production , it may qualify as the first intentional example of what is now called a neo @-@ noir film ; it was likely a source of inspiration for both Melville 's Le Samouraï and Scorsese 's Taxi Driver . Belying its parodic strain , The Long Goodbye 's final act is seriously grave . Taxi Driver caustically deconstructs the " dark " crime film , taking it to an absurd extreme and then offering a conclusion that manages to mock every possible anticipated ending — triumphant , tragic , artfully ambivalent — while being each , all at once . Flirting with splatter status even more brazenly , the Coens ' Blood Simple is both an exacting pastiche and a gross exaggeration of classic noir . Adapted by director Robinson <unk> from a novel by Charles <unk> , The Woman Chaser ( 1999 ) sends up not just the noir mode but the entire Hollywood filmmaking process , with seemingly each shot staged as the visual equivalent of an acerbic Marlowe wisecrack . 
 In other media , the television series Sledge Hammer ! ( 1986 – 88 ) lampoons noir , along with such topics as capital punishment , gun fetishism , and Dirty Harry . Sesame Street ( 1969 – <unk> . ) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog as a private eye ; the sketches refer to some of the typical motifs of noir films , in particular the voiceover . Garrison Keillor 's radio program A Prairie Home Companion features the recurring character Guy Noir , a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce ( Guy also appears in the Altman @-@ directed film based on Keillor 's show ) . Firesign Theatre 's Nick Danger has trod the same not @-@ so @-@ mean streets , both on radio and in comedy albums . Cartoons such as Garfield 's Babes and Bullets ( 1989 ) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of Calvin and Hobbes have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition — one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows . 
 = = Identifying characteristics = = 
 In their original 1955 canon of film noir , Raymond Borde and Etienne <unk> identified twenty @-@ two Hollywood films released between 1941 and 1952 as core examples ; they listed another fifty @-@ nine American films from the period as significantly related to the field of noir . A half @-@ century later , film historians and critics had come to agree on a canon of approximately three hundred films from 1940 – 58 . There remain , however , many differences of opinion over whether other films of the era , among them a number of well @-@ known ones , qualify as film noirs or not . For instance , The Night of the Hunter ( 1955 ) , starring Robert Mitchum in an acclaimed performance , is treated as a film noir by some critics , but not by others . Some critics include Suspicion ( 1941 ) , directed by Alfred Hitchcock , in their catalogues of noir ; others ignore it . Concerning films made either before or after the classic period , or outside of the United States at any time , consensus is even rarer . 
 To support their categorization of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others , many critics refer to a set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode . The question of what constitutes the set of noir 's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy . For instance , critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion , but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings ( e.g. , Stranger on the Third Floor , The Big Sleep , Dark Passage , and The Dark Corner ) , while the tone of many other noir <unk> is ambivalent . Some critics perceive classic noir 's hallmark as a distinctive visual style . Others , observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs , instead emphasize plot and character type . Still others focus on mood and attitude . No survey of classic noir 's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive . In the 1990s and 2000s , critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo @-@ noir ; once again , there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period . 
 = = = Visual style = = = 
 The low @-@ key lighting schemes of many classic film noirs are associated with stark light / dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning — a style known as chiaroscuro ( a term adopted from Renaissance painting ) . The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods , cast upon an actor , a wall , or an entire set , are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a cliché well before the neo @-@ noir era . Characters ' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness — a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking . While black @-@ and @-@ white cinematography is considered by many to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir , the color films Leave Her to Heaven ( 1945 ) and Niagara ( 1953 ) are routinely included in noir filmographies , while Slightly Scarlet ( 1956 ) , Party Girl ( 1958 ) , and Vertigo ( 1958 ) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics . 
 Film noir is also known for its use of low @-@ angle , wide @-@ angle , and skewed , or Dutch angle shots . Other devices of disorientation relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected in one or more mirrors , shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects ( such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train ) , and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature . Night @-@ for @-@ night shooting , as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day @-@ for @-@ night , was often employed . From the mid @-@ 1940s forward , location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir . 
 In an analysis of the visual approach of Kiss Me Deadly , a late and self @-@ consciously stylized example of classic noir , critic Alain Silver describes how cinematographic choices emphasize the story 's themes and mood . In one scene , the characters , seen through a " confusion of angular shapes " , thus appear " caught in a tangible vortex or enclosed in a trap . " Silver makes a case for how " side light is used ... to reflect character ambivalence " , while shots of characters in which they are lit from below " conform to a convention of visual expression which associates shadows cast upward of the face with the unnatural and ominous " . 
 = = = Structure and <unk> devices = = = 
 Film noirs tend to have unusually convoluted story lines , frequently involving flashbacks and other editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence . Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device . <unk> narration , sometimes used as a structuring device , came to be seen as a noir hallmark ; while classic noir is generally associated with first @-@ person narration ( i.e. , by the protagonist ) , Stephen Neale notes that third @-@ person narration is common among noirs of the <unk> style . Neo @-@ noirs as varied as The Element of Crime ( surrealist ) , After Dark , My Sweet ( retro ) , and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( meta ) have employed the flashback / voiceover combination . 
 Bold experiments in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era : Lady in the Lake , for example , is shot entirely from the point of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe ; the face of star ( and director ) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors . The Chase ( 1946 ) takes <unk> and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system , redolent of certain horror stories , but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre . In their different ways , both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men . Latter @-@ day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema , as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction , Fight Club , and Memento . 
 = = = Plots , characters , and settings = = = 
 Crime , usually murder , is an element of almost all films noir ; in addition to standard @-@ issue greed , jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation . A crime investigation — by a private eye , a police detective ( sometimes acting alone ) , or a concerned amateur — is the most prevalent , but far from dominant , basic plot . In other common plots the protagonists are implicated in heists or con games , or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs . False suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements , as are betrayals and double @-@ crosses . According to J. David Slocum , " protagonists assume the literal identities of dead men in nearly fifteen percent of all noir . " Amnesia is fairly epidemic — " noir 's version of the common cold " , in the words of film historian Lee Server . 
 Films noir tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm , often fall guys of one sort or another . The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as " alienated " ; in the words of Silver and Ward , " filled with existential bitterness " . Certain archetypal characters appear in many films noir — hardboiled detectives , femme fatales , corrupt policemen , jealous husbands , intrepid claims adjusters , and down @-@ and @-@ out writers . Among characters of every stripe , cigarette smoking is rampant . From historical commentators to neo @-@ noir pictures to pop culture ephemera , the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures , though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir . Of the twenty @-@ six National Film Registry noirs , in only four does the star play a private eye : The Maltese Falcon , The Big Sleep , Out of the Past , and Kiss Me Deadly . Just four others readily qualify as detective stories : Laura , The Killers , The Naked City , and Touch of Evil . 
 Film noir is often associated with an urban setting , and a few cities — Los Angeles , San Francisco , New York , and Chicago , in particular — are the location of many of the classic films . In the eyes of many critics , the city is presented in noir as a " labyrinth " or " maze " . Bars , lounges , nightclubs , and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action . The climaxes of a substantial number of films noir take place in visually complex , often industrial settings , such as refineries , factories , <unk> , power plants — most famously the explosive conclusion of White Heat , set at a chemical plant . In the popular ( and , frequently enough , critical ) imagination , in noir it is always night and it always rains . 
 A substantial trend within latter @-@ day noir — dubbed " film soleil " by critic D. K. Holm — heads in precisely the opposite direction , with tales of deception , seduction , and corruption exploiting bright , sun @-@ baked settings , stereotypically the desert or open water , to searing effect . Significant predecessors from the classic and early post @-@ classic eras include The Lady from Shanghai ; the Robert Ryan vehicle Inferno ( 1953 ) ; the French adaptation of Patricia Highsmith 's The Talented Mr. Ripley , Plein soleil ( Purple Noon in the U.S. , more accurately rendered elsewhere as Blazing Sun or Full Sun ; 1960 ) ; and director Don Siegel 's version of The Killers ( 1964 ) . The tendency was at its peak during the late 1980s and 1990s , with films such as Dead Calm ( 1989 ) , After Dark , My Sweet ( 1990 ) , The Hot Spot ( 1990 ) , Delusion ( 1991 ) , Red Rock West ( 1993 ) and the television series Miami Vice . 
 = = = Worldview , morality , and tone = = = 
 Film noir is often described as essentially pessimistic . The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations ( which , in general , they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating ) , striving against random , uncaring fate , and frequently doomed . The films are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt . Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era — in particular , with a sense of heightened anxiety and alienation that is said to have followed World War II . In author Nicholas Christopher 's opinion , " it is as if the war , and the social eruptions in its aftermath , unleashed demons that had been bottled up in the national psyche . " Film noirs , especially those of the 1950s and the height of the Red Scare , are often said to reflect cultural paranoia ; Kiss Me Deadly is the noir most frequently marshaled as evidence for this claim . 
 Film noir is often said to be defined by " moral ambiguity " , yet the Production Code obliged almost all classic noirs to see that steadfast virtue was ultimately rewarded and vice , in the absence of shame and redemption , severely punished ( however dramatically incredible the final rendering of mandatory justice might be ) . A substantial number of latter @-@ day noirs flout such conventions : vice emerges triumphant in films as varied as the grim Chinatown and the ribald Hot Spot . 
 The tone of film noir is generally regarded as downbeat ; some critics experience it as darker still — " overwhelmingly black " , according to Robert Ottoson . Influential critic ( and filmmaker ) Paul Schrader wrote in a seminal 1972 essay that " film noir is defined by tone " , a tone he seems to perceive as " hopeless " . In describing the adaptation of Double Indemnity , noir analyst Foster Hirsch describes the " requisite hopeless tone " achieved by the filmmakers , which appears to characterize his view of noir as a whole . On the other hand , definitive film noirs such as The Big Sleep , The Lady from Shanghai , Scarlet Street and Double Indemnity itself are famed for their hardboiled repartee , often imbued with sexual innuendo and self @-@ reflexive humor . 
 = John Gielgud = 
 Sir Arthur John Gielgud OM CH ( / <unk> / ; 14 April 1904 – 21 May 2000 ) was an English actor and theatre director whose career spanned eight decades . With Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier , he was one of the trinity of actors who dominated the British stage for much of the 20th century . A member of the Terry family theatrical dynasty , he gained his first paid acting work as a junior member of his cousin Phyllis Neilson @-@ Terry 's company in 1922 . After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art he worked in repertory theatre and in the West End before establishing himself at the Old Vic as an exponent of Shakespeare in 1929 – 31 . 
 During the 1930s Gielgud was a stage star in the West End and on Broadway , appearing in new works and classics . He began a parallel career as a director , and set up his own company at the Queen 's Theatre , London . He was regarded by many as the finest Hamlet of his era , and was also known for high comedy roles such as John Worthing in The Importance of Being Earnest . In the 1950s Gielgud feared that his career was threatened when he was convicted and fined for a homosexual offence , but his colleagues and the public supported him loyally . When avant @-@ garde plays began to supersede traditional West End productions in the later 1950s he found no new suitable stage roles , and for several years he was best known in the theatre for his one @-@ man Shakespeare show , The Ages of Man . From the late 1960s he found new plays that suited him , by authors including Alan Bennett , David Storey and Harold Pinter . 
 During the first half of his career Gielgud did not take the cinema seriously . Though he made his first film in 1924 , and had successes with The Good Companions ( 1933 ) and Julius Caesar ( 1953 ) , he did not begin a regular film career until his sixties . Between Becket in 1964 , for which he received his first Oscar nomination , and Elizabeth in 1998 he appeared in more than sixty films . As the acid @-@ tongued Hobson in Arthur ( 1981 ) he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . 
 Although largely indifferent to awards , Gielgud had the rare distinction of winning an Oscar , an Emmy , a Grammy , and a Tony . He was famous from the start of his career for his voice and his mastery of Shakespearean verse . He broadcast more than a hundred radio and television dramas , between 1929 and 1994 , and made commercial recordings of many plays , including ten of Shakespeare 's . Among his honours , he was knighted in 1953 and the Gielgud Theatre was named after him . From 1977 to 1989 , he was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art .

 = = = Background and early years = = = 
 Gielgud was born in South Kensington , London , the third of the four children and youngest of three sons of Frank Henry Gielgud ( 1860 – 1949 ) and his second wife , Kate Terry @-@ Gielgud , née Terry @-@ Lewis ( 1868 – 1958 ) . The two elder boys were Lewis , who became a senior official of the Red Cross and UNESCO , and Val , later head of BBC radio drama ; their sister Eleanor became John 's secretary for many years . On his father 's side , Gielgud was of Lithuanian and Polish descent . The surname derives from <unk> , a village in Lithuania . The Counts Gielgud had owned the <unk> Castle on the River Niemen , but their estates were confiscated after they took part in a failed uprising against Russian rule in 1830 – 31 . Jan Gielgud took refuge in England with his family ; one of his grandchildren was Frank Gielgud , whose maternal grandmother was a famous Polish actress , Aniela <unk> . 
 Frank married into a family with wide theatrical connections . His wife , who was on the stage until she married , was the daughter of the actress Kate Terry , and a member of the stage dynasty that included Ellen , Fred and Marion Terry , Mabel Terry @-@ Lewis and Edith and Edward Gordon Craig . Frank had no theatrical ambitions and worked all his life as a stockbroker in the City of London . 
 In 1912 , aged eight , Gielgud went to Hillside preparatory school in Surrey as his elder brothers had done . For a child with no interest in sport he acquitted himself reasonably well in cricket and rugby for the school . In class , he hated mathematics , was fair at classics , and excelled at English and divinity . Hillside encouraged his interest in drama , and he played several leading roles in school productions , including Mark Antony in Julius Caesar and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice . 
 After Hillside , Lewis and Val had won scholarships to Eton and Rugby , respectively ; lacking their academic achievement , John failed to secure such a scholarship . He was sent as a day boy to Westminster School , where , as he later said , he had access to the West End " in time to touch the fringe of the great century of the theatre . " He saw Sarah Bernhardt act , Adeline Genée dance and Albert Chevalier , Vesta Tilley and Marie Lloyd perform in the music halls . The school choir sang in services at Westminster Abbey , which appealed to his fondness for ritual . He showed talent at sketching , and for a while thought of scenic design as a possible career . 
 The young Gielgud 's father took him to concerts , which he liked , and galleries and museums , " which bored me rigid . " Both parents were keen theatregoers , but did not encourage their children to follow an acting career . Val Gielgud recalled , " Our parents looked distinctly sideways at the Stage as a means of livelihood , and when John showed some talent for drawing his father spoke crisply of the advantages of an architect 's office . " On leaving Westminster in 1921 , Gielgud persuaded his reluctant parents to let him take drama lessons on the understanding that if he was not self @-@ supporting by the age of twenty @-@ five he would seek an office post . 
 = = = First acting experience = = = 
 Gielgud , aged seventeen , joined a private drama school run by Constance Benson , wife of the actor @-@ manager Sir Frank Benson . On the new boy 's first day Lady Benson remarked on his physical awkwardness : " she said I walked like a cat with rickets . It dealt a severe blow to my conceit , which was a good thing . " Before and after joining the school he played in several amateur productions , and in November 1921 made his debut with a professional company , though he himself was not paid . He played the Herald in Henry V at the Old Vic ; he had one line to speak and , he recalled , spoke it badly . He was kept on for the rest of the season in walk @-@ on parts in King Lear , Wat Tyler and Peer Gynt , with no lines . 
 Gielgud 's first substantial engagement came through his family . In 1922 his cousin Phyllis Neilson @-@ Terry invited him to tour in J. B. Fagan 's The Wheel , as understudy , bit @-@ part player and assistant stage manager , an invitation he accepted . A colleague , recognising that the young man had talent but lacked technique , recommended him to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art ( RADA ) . Gielgud was awarded a scholarship to the academy and trained there throughout 1923 under Kenneth Barnes , Helen Haye and Claude Rains . 
 The actor @-@ manager Nigel Playfair , a friend of Gielgud 's family , saw him in a student presentation of J. M. Barrie 's The Admirable Crichton . Playfair was impressed and cast him as Felix , the poet @-@ butterfly , in the British premiere of the Čapek brothers ' The Insect Play . Gielgud later said that he made a poor impression in the part : " I am surprised that the audience did not throw things at me . " The critics were cautious but not hostile to the play ; it did not attract the public and closed after a month . While still continuing his studies at RADA , Gielgud appeared again for Playfair in Robert E Lee by John Drinkwater . After leaving the academy at the end of 1923 Gielgud played a Christmas season as Charley in Charley 's Aunt in the West End , and then joined Fagan 's repertory company at the Oxford Playhouse . 
 Gielgud was in the Oxford company in January and February 1924 , from October 1924 to the end of January 1925 , and in August 1925 . He played a wide range of parts in classics and modern plays , greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process . The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in The Cherry Orchard , his first experience of Chekhov : " It was the first time I ever went out on stage feeling that perhaps , after all , I could really be an actor . " 
 = = = Early West End roles = = = 
 Between Gielgud 's first two Oxford seasons , the producer Barry Jackson cast him as Romeo to the Juliet of Gwen Ffrangcon @-@ Davies at the Regent 's Theatre , London , in May 1924 . The production was not a great success , but the two performers became close friends and frequently worked together throughout their careers . Gielgud made his screen debut during 1924 as Daniel <unk> in Walter Summers 's silent film Who Is the Man ? ( 1924 ) . 
 In May 1925 the Oxford production of The Cherry Orchard was brought to the Lyric Theatre , Hammersmith . Gielgud again played Trofimov . His distinctive speaking voice attracted attention and led to work for BBC radio , which his biographer Sheridan Morley calls " a medium he made his own for seventy years . " In the same year Noël Coward chose Gielgud as his understudy in his play The Vortex . For the last month of the West End run Gielgud took over Coward 's role of Nicky Lancaster , the drug @-@ addicted son of a nymphomaniac mother . It was in Gielgud 's words " a highly @-@ strung , nervous , hysterical part which depended a lot upon emotion . " He found it tiring to play because he had not yet learned how to pace himself , but he thought it " a thrilling engagement because it led to so many great things afterwards . " 
 The success of The Cherry Orchard led to what one critic called a " Chekhov boom " in British theatres , and Gielgud was among its leading players . As Konstantin in The Seagull in October 1925 he impressed the Russian director Theodore Komisarjevsky , who cast him as <unk> in the British premiere of Three Sisters . The production received enthusiastic reviews , and Gielgud 's highly praised performance enhanced his reputation as a potential star . There followed three years of mixed fortunes for him , with successes in fringe productions , but West End stardom was elusive . 
 In 1926 the producer Basil Dean offered Gielgud the lead role , Lewis Dodd , in a dramatisation of Margaret Kennedy 's best @-@ selling novel , The Constant Nymph . Before rehearsals began Dean found that a bigger star than Gielgud was available , namely Coward , to whom he gave the part . Gielgud had an enforceable contractual claim to the role , but Dean , a notorious bully , was a powerful force in British theatre . Intimidated , Gielgud accepted the position of understudy , with a guarantee that he would take over the lead from Coward when the latter , who disliked playing in long runs , left . In the event Coward , who had been overworking , suffered a nervous collapse three weeks after the opening night , and Gielgud played the lead for the rest of the run . The play ran for nearly a year in London and then went on tour . 
 By this time Gielgud was earning enough to leave the family home and take a small flat in the West End . He had his first serious romantic relationship , living with John Perry , an unsuccessful actor , later a writer , who remained a lifelong friend after their affair ended . Morley makes the point that , like Coward , Gielgud 's principal passion was the stage ; both men had casual dalliances , but were more comfortable with " low @-@ maintenance " long @-@ term partners who did not impede their theatrical work and ambitions . 
 In 1928 Gielgud made his Broadway debut as the Grand Duke Alexander in Alfred Neumann 's The Patriot . The play was a failure , closing after a week , but Gielgud liked New York and received favourable reviews from critics including Alexander Woollcott and Brooks Atkinson . After returning to London he starred in a succession of short runs , including Ibsen 's Ghosts with Mrs Patrick Campbell ( 1928 ) , and Reginald Berkeley 's The Lady with a Lamp ( 1929 ) with Edith Evans and Gwen Ffrangcon @-@ Davies . In 1928 he made his second film , The Clue of the New Pin . This , billed as " the first British full @-@ length talkie " , was an adaptation of an Edgar Wallace mystery story ; Gielgud played a young scoundrel who commits two murders and very nearly a third before he himself is killed . 
 = = = Old Vic = = = 
 In 1929 Harcourt Williams , newly appointed as director of productions at the Old Vic , invited Gielgud to join the company for the forthcoming season . The Old Vic , in an unfashionable area of London south of the Thames , was run by Lilian Baylis to offer plays and operas to a mostly working @-@ class audience at low ticket prices . She paid her performers very modest wages , but the theatre was known for its unrivalled repertory of classics , mostly Shakespeare , and Gielgud was not the first West End star to take a large pay cut to work there . It was , in Morley 's words , the place to learn Shakespearean technique and try new ideas . 
 During his first season at the Old Vic , Gielgud played Romeo to the Juliet of Adele Dixon , Antonio in The Merchant of Venice , <unk> in The Imaginary Invalid , the title role in Richard II , and Oberon in A Midsummer Night 's Dream . His Romeo was not well reviewed , but as Richard II Gielgud was recognised by critics as a Shakespearean actor of undoubted authority . The reviewer in The Times commented on his sensitiveness , strength and firmness , and called his performance " work of genuine distinction , not only in its grasp of character , but in its control of language . " Later in the season he was cast as Mark Antony in Julius Caesar , Orlando in As You Like It , the Emperor in Androcles and the Lion and the title role in Pirandello 's The Man with the Flower in His Mouth . 
 In April 1930 Gielgud finished the season playing Hamlet . Williams 's production used the complete text of the play . This was regarded as a radical innovation ; extensive cuts had been customary for earlier productions . A running time of nearly five hours did not dampen the enthusiasm of the public , the critics or the acting profession . Sybil Thorndyke said , " I never hoped to see Hamlet played as in one 's dreams ... I 've had an evening of being swept right off my feet into another life – far more real than the life I live in , and moved , moved beyond words . " The production gained such a reputation that the Old Vic began to attract large numbers of West End theatregoers . Demand was so great that the cast moved to the Queen 's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue , where Williams staged the piece with the text discreetly shortened . The effect of the cuts was to give the title role even more prominence . Gielgud 's Hamlet was richly praised by the critics . Ivor Brown called it " a tremendous performance ... the best Hamlet of [ my ] experience . " James Agate wrote , " I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that it is the high water @-@ mark of English Shakespearean acting of our time . " 
 Hamlet was a role with which Gielgud was associated over the next decade and more . After the run at the Queen 's finished he turned to another part for which he became well known , John Worthing in The Importance of Being Earnest . Gielgud 's biographer Jonathan Croall comments that the two roles illustrated two sides of the actor 's personality : on the one hand the romantic and soulful Hamlet , and on the other the witty and superficial Worthing . The formidable Lady Bracknell was played by his aunt , Mabel Terry @-@ Lewis . The Times observed , " Mr Gielgud and Miss Terry @-@ Lewis together are brilliant ... they have the supreme grace of always allowing Wilde to speak in his own voice . " 
 Returning to the Old Vic for the 1930 – 31 season , Gielgud found several changes to the company . Donald Wolfit , who loathed him and was himself disliked by his colleagues , was dropped , as was Adele Dixon . Gielgud was uncertain of the suitability of the most prominent new recruit , Ralph Richardson , but Williams was sure that after this season Gielgud would move on ; he saw Richardson as a potential replacement . The two actors had little in common . Richardson recalled , " He was a kind of brilliant butterfly , while I was a very gloomy sort of boy " , and " I found his clothes extravagant , I found his conversation flippant . He was the New Young Man of his time and I didn 't like him . " The first production of the season was Henry IV , Part 1 , in which Gielgud as Hotspur had the best of the reviews . Richardson 's notices , and the relationship of the two leading men , improved markedly when Gielgud , who was playing Prospero in The Tempest , helped Richardson with his performance as Caliban : 
 He gave me about two hundred ideas , as he usually does , twenty @-@ five of which I eagerly seized on , and when I went away I thought , " This chap , you know , I don 't like him very much but by God he knows something about this here play . " ... And then out of that we formed a friendship . 
 The friendship and professional association lasted for more than fifty years , until the end of Richardson 's life . Gielgud 's other roles in this season were Lord <unk> in The Jealous Wife , Richard II again , Antony in Antony and Cleopatra , Malvolio in Twelfth Night , Sergius in Arms and the Man , Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing – another role for which he became celebrated – and he concluded the season as King Lear . His performance divided opinion . The Times commented , " It is a mountain of a part , and at the end of the evening the peak remains <unk> " ; in The Manchester Guardian , however , Brown wrote that Gielgud " is a match for the thunder , and at length takes the Dover road with a broken tranquillity that allowed every word of the King 's agony to be clear as well as poignant . " 
 = = = West End star = = = 
 Returning to the West End , Gielgud starred in J B Priestley 's The Good Companions , adapted for the stage by the author and Edward Knoblock . The production ran from May 1931 for 331 performances , and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success . He played Inigo <unk> , a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe . This crowd @-@ pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers , who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding , but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique . During the run of the play he made another film , Insult ( 1932 ) , a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion , and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933 , with Jessie Matthews . A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud 's view of film acting : " There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions , which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket . " In his first volume of memoirs , published in 1939 , Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested . Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier , he made few films until after the Second World War , and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that . As he put it in 1994 , " I was stupid enough to toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts . " 
 In 1932 Gielgud turned to directing . At the invitation of George Devine , the president of the Oxford University Dramatic Society , Gielgud took charge of a production of Romeo and Juliet by the society , featuring two guest stars : Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet and Edith Evans as the Nurse . The rest of the cast were students , led by Christopher Hassall as Romeo , and included Devine , William Devlin and Terence Rattigan . The experience was satisfactory to Gielgud : he enjoyed the attentions of the undergraduates , had a brief affair with one of them , James Lees @-@ Milne , and was widely praised for his inspiring direction and his protégés ' success with the play . Already notorious for his innocent slips of the tongue ( he called them " <unk> " ) , in a speech after the final performance he referred to Ashcroft and Evans as " Two leading ladies , the like of whom I hope I shall never meet again . " 
 During the rest of 1932 Gielgud played in a new piece , Musical Chairs , by Ronald Mackenzie , and directed one new and one classic play , Strange Orchestra by Rodney Ackland in the West End , and The Merchant of Venice at the Old Vic , with Malcolm Keen as Shylock and Ashcroft as Portia . In 1932 he starred in Richard of Bordeaux by Elizabeth MacKintosh . This , a retelling in modern language of the events of Richard II , was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw 's Saint Joan nine years earlier , more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had been . After an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell @-@ out hit and played in London and on tour over the next three years . 
 Between seasons of Richard , in 1934 Gielgud returned to Hamlet in London and on tour , directing and playing the title role . The production was a box @-@ office success , and the critics were lavish in their praise . In The New York Times , Charles Morgan wrote , " I have never before heard the rhythm and verse and the naturalness of speech so gently combined . ... If I see a better performance of this play than this before I die , it will be a miracle . " Morley writes that junior members of the cast such as Alec Guinness and Frith Banbury would gather in the wings every night " to watch what they seemed intuitively already to know was to be the Hamlet of their time . " 
 The following year Gielgud staged perhaps his most famous Shakespeare production , a Romeo and Juliet in which he co @-@ starred with Ashcroft and Olivier . Gielgud had spotted Olivier 's potential and gave him a major step up in his career . For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo , after which they exchanged roles . As at Oxford , Ashcroft and Evans were Juliet and the nurse . The production broke all box @-@ office records for the play , running at the New Theatre for 189 performances . Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night , which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare 's verse , comparing it with his co @-@ star 's mastery of the poetry . The friendship between the two men was prickly , on Olivier 's side , for the rest of his life . 
 In May 1936 Gielgud played Trigorin in The Seagull , with Evans as Arkadina and Ashcroft as Nina . Komisarjevsky directed , which made rehearsals difficult as Ashcroft , with whom he had been living , had just left him . Nonetheless , Morley writes , the critical reception was ecstatic . In the same year Gielgud made his last pre @-@ war film , co @-@ starring with Madeleine Carroll in Alfred Hitchcock 's Secret Agent . The director 's insensitivity to actors made Gielgud nervous and further increased his dislike of filming . The two stars were praised for their performances , but Hitchcock 's " preoccupation with incident " was felt by critics to make the leading roles one @-@ dimensional , and the laurels went to Peter Lorre as Gielgud 's deranged assistant . 
 From September 1936 to February 1937 Gielgud played Hamlet in North America , opening in Toronto before moving to New York and Boston . He was nervous about starring on Broadway for the first time , particularly as it became known that the popular actor Leslie Howard was to appear there in a rival production of the play . When Gielgud opened at the Empire Theatre in October the reviews were mixed , but , as the actor wrote to his mother , the audience response was extraordinary . " They stay at the end and shout every night and the stage door is beset by fans . " Howard 's production opened in November ; it was , in Gielgud 's words , a débâcle , and the " battle of the Hamlets " heralded in the New York press was over almost as soon as it had begun . Howard 's version closed within a month ; the run of Gielgud 's production beat Broadway records for the play . 
 = = = Queen 's Theatre company = = = 
 After his return from America in February 1937 Gielgud starred in He Was Born Gay by Emlyn Williams . This romantic tragedy about French royalty after the Revolution was quite well received during its pre @-@ London tour , but was savaged by the critics in the West End . The Times said , " This is one of those occasions on which criticism does not stand about talking , but rubs its eyes and withdraws hastily with an embarrassed , incredulous , and uncomprehending blush . What made Mr Emlyn Williams write this play or Mr Gielgud and Miss Ffrangcon @-@ Davies appear in it is not to be understood . " The play closed after twelve performances . Its failure , so soon after his Shakespearean triumphs , prompted Gielgud to examine his career and his life . His domestic relationship with Perry was comfortable but unexciting , he saw no future in a film career , and the Old Vic could not afford to stage the classics on the large scale he aspired to . He decided that he must form his own company to play Shakespeare and other classic plays in the West End . 
 Gielgud invested £ 5 @,@ 000 , most of his earnings from the American Hamlet ; Perry , who had family money , put in the same sum . From September 1937 to April 1938 Gielgud was the tenant of the Queen 's Theatre , where he presented a season consisting of Richard II , The School for Scandal , Three Sisters , and The Merchant of Venice . His company included Harry Andrews , Peggy Ashcroft , Glen Byam Shaw , George Devine , Michael Redgrave and Harcourt Williams , with Angela Baddeley and Gwen Ffrangcon @-@ Davies as guests . His own roles were King Richard , Joseph Surface , Vershinin and Shylock . Gielgud 's performances drew superlatives from reviewers and colleagues . Agate considered his Richard II , " probably the best piece of Shakespearean acting on the English stage today . " Olivier said that Gielgud 's Joseph Surface was " the best light comedy performance I 've ever seen , or ever shall see . " 
 The venture did not lose money , nor did it make much , and in July 1938 Gielgud turned to more conventional West End enterprises , in unconventional circumstances . He directed Spring Meeting , a farce by Perry and Molly Keane , presented by Binkie Beaumont , for whom Perry had just left Gielgud . Somehow the three men remained on excellent terms . In September of the same year Gielgud appeared in Dodie Smith 's sentimental comedy Dear Octopus . The following year he directed and appeared in The Importance of Being Earnest at the Queen 's , with Evans playing Lady Bracknell for the first time . They were gratified when Allan Aynesworth , who had played Algernon in the 1895 premiere , said that the new production " caught the gaiety and exactly the right atmosphere . It 's all delightful ! " 
 = = = War and post @-@ war = = = 
 At the start of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service , but was told that men of his age , thirty @-@ five , would not be wanted for at least six months . The government quickly came to the view that most actors would do more good performing to entertain the troops and the general public than serving , whether suitable or not , in the armed forces . 
 Gielgud directed Michael Redgrave in a 1940 London production of The Beggar 's Opera for the Glyndebourne Festival . This was a chaotic affair : Gielgud 's direction confused his star , and when Redgrave lost his voice Gielgud had to step in and sing the role as best he could . Gielgud felt that something serious or even solemn was necessary for wartime London , where most entertainment was light @-@ hearted . Together with Harley Granville @-@ Barker and Guthrie he reopened the Old Vic with Shakespeare . His King Lear once again divided the critics , but his Prospero was a considerable success . He played the role quite differently from his attempt on the same stage in 1930 : in place of the " manic conjurer " his Prospero was " very far from the usual mixture of Father Christmas , a Colonial Bishop , and the President of the Magicians ' Union ... a clear , arresting picture of a virile Renaissance notable " , according to Brown . The critics singled out , among the other players , Jack Hawkins as Caliban , Marius Goring as Ariel , Jessica Tandy as Miranda and Alec Guinness as Ferdinand . 
 Following the example of several of his stage colleagues , Gielgud joined tours of military camps . He gave recitals of prose and poetry , and acted in a triple bill of short plays , including two from Coward 's Tonight at 8 @.@ 30 , but he found at first that less highbrow performers like Beatrice Lillie were better than he at entertaining the troops . He returned to filming in 1940 , as Disraeli in Thorold Dickinson 's The Prime Minister . In this morale @-@ boosting film he portrayed the politician from ages thirty to seventy ; this was , in Morley 's view , the first time he seemed at home before the camera . Gielgud made no more films for the next ten years ; he turned down the role of Julius Caesar in the 1945 film of Shaw 's Caesar and Cleopatra with Vivien Leigh . He and Leigh were close friends , and Shaw tried hard to persuade him to play the part , but Gielgud had taken a strong dislike to the director , Gabriel Pascal . Caesar was eventually played by Gielgud 's former teacher , Claude Rains . 
 Throughout 1941 and 1942 Gielgud worked continually , in Barrie 's Dear Brutus , another Importance of Being Earnest in the West End , and Macbeth on tour . Returning , with more assurance than before , to entertaining the troops , he so far departed from his classical style as to join Lillie and Michael Wilding singing a comic trio . His 1943 revival of William Congreve 's Love for Love on tour and then in London received high praise from reviewers . In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson , who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic to form a new company . Unwilling to take sole charge , Richardson proposed a managing triumvirate of Gielgud , Olivier and himself . Gielgud declined : " It would be a disaster , you would have to spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me . " 
 A 1944 – 45 season at the Haymarket for Beaumont included a Hamlet that many considered his finest . Agate wrote , " Mr Gielgud is now completely and authoritatively master of this tremendous part . ... I hold that this is , and is likely to remain , the best Hamlet of our time . " Also in the season were A Midsummer Night 's Dream , The Duchess of Malfi and the first major revival of Lady Windermere 's Fan ( 1945 ) . These productions attracted much praise , but at this point in his career Gielgud was somewhat overshadowed by his old colleagues . Olivier was celebrated for his recent film of Henry V , and with Richardson ( and John Burrell in Gielgud 's stead ) was making the Old Vic " the most famous theatre in the Anglo @-@ Saxon world " according to the critic Harold Hobson . 
 Through the autumn and winter of 1945 – 46 Gielgud toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with Hamlet and Coward 's Blithe Spirit . During this tour he played Hamlet on stage for the last time . He was <unk> in a stage version of Crime and Punishment , in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the following year . Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had done so far , other than Hamlet . Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in The Importance of Being Earnest and Love for Love . Edith Evans was tired of the role of Lady Bracknell , and refused to join him ; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim . Gielgud was in demand as a director , with six productions in 1948 – 49 . They included The Heiress in 1949 , when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft , saving what seemed a doomed production ; it ran for 644 performances . His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in The Lady 's Not for Burning , which he also directed . The London cast included the young Claire Bloom and Richard Burton , who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year . 
 = = = 1950s – film success and personal crisis = = = 
 At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre , Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon , Gielgud did much to reclaim his position as a leading Shakespearean . His cold , unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook 's production of Measure for Measure ( 1950 ) showed the public a new , naturalistic manner in his playing . He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook , which were well received . His own attempt at direction in Stratford , for Richardson 's Macbeth in 1952 , was much less successful , with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director . 
 In 1953 Gielgud made his first Hollywood film , the sole classical actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz 's Julius Caesar . Marlon Brando ( Mark Antony ) was in awe of him , and James Mason ( Brutus ) was disheartened at Gielgud 's seemingly effortless skill . Gielgud , for his part , felt he learned much about film technique from Mason . Gielgud enjoyed his four @-@ month stay in California , not least , as Morley comments , for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality . 
 Returning to London later in 1953 Gielgud took over management of the Lyric , Hammersmith , for a classical season of Richard II , Congreve 's The Way of the World , and Thomas Otway 's Venice Preserv 'd , directing the first , acting in the last , and doing both in the second . Feeling he was too old for Richard , he cast the young Paul Scofield ; both the actor and the production were a critical and commercial success . During the season Gielgud was knighted in the 1953 Coronation honours . 
 On the evening of 20 October 1953 , Gielgud , usually highly discreet about casual sex , was arrested in Chelsea for cruising in a public lavatory . Until the 1960s sexual activity of any kind between men was illegal in Britain . The Home Secretary of the day , David Maxwell Fyfe , was fervently homophobic , urging the police to arrest anyone who contravened the Victorian laws against homosexuality . Gielgud was fined ; when the press reported the story , he thought his disgrace would end his career . When the news broke he was in Liverpool on the pre @-@ London tour of a new play , A Day by the Sea . According to the biographer Richard Huggett , Gielgud was so paralysed by nerves that the prospect of going onstage as usual seemed impossible , but his fellow players , led by Sybil Thorndike , encouraged him : 
 She grabbed him and whispered fiercely , " Come on , John darling , they won 't boo me " , and led him firmly on to the stage . To everybody 's astonishment and indescribable relief , the audience gave him a standing ovation . They cheered , they applauded , they shouted . The message was quite clear . The English public had always been loyal to its favourites , and this was their chance to show that they didn 't care <unk> what he had done in his private life ... they loved him and respected him dearly . It was a moment never to be forgotten by those who witnessed it . 
 His career was safe , but the episode briefly affected Gielgud 's health ; he suffered a nervous breakdown some months afterwards . He never spoke publicly about the incident , and it was quickly sidelined by the press and politely ignored by writers during his lifetime . Privately he made donations to gay campaign groups , but did not endorse them in public . In his later years he said to the actor Simon Callow , " I do admire people like you and Ian McKellen for coming out , but I can 't be doing with that myself . " 
 Between December 1953 and June 1955 Gielgud concentrated on directing and did not appear on stage . His productions ranged from a revival of Charley 's Aunt with John Mills to The Cherry Orchard with Ffrangcon @-@ Davies , and Twelfth Night with Olivier . His return to the stage was in a production of King Lear , which was badly hampered by costumes and scenery by Isamu Noguchi that the critics found ludicrous . A revival of Much Ado About Nothing with Ashcroft in 1955 was much better received ; in The Manchester Guardian , Philip Hope @-@ Wallace called it " Shakespearean comedy for once perfectly realised . " In 1955 Gielgud made his second appearance in a film of Shakespeare , portraying Clarence in Olivier 's Richard III . 
 In the second half of the 1950s Gielgud 's career was in the doldrums as far as new plays were concerned . British theatre was moving away from the West End glamour of Beaumont 's productions to more avant @-@ garde works . Olivier had a great success in John Osborne 's The Entertainer in 1957 , but Gielgud was not in tune with the new wave of writers . He remained in demand as a Shakespearean , but there were few new plays suitable for him . He directed and played the lead in Coward 's Nude with Violin in 1956 , which was dismissed by the critics as old fashioned , though it ran for more than a year . He made two film appearances , playing a cameo comedy scene with Coward in Michael Anderson 's Around the World in 80 Days ( 1956 ) and Mr Barrett , in Sidney Franklin 's 1957 remake of The Barretts of Wimpole Street . He did not consider his performance as the tyrannical father convincing , and confessed that he undertook it only for the large fee ( " it will set me up for a couple of years " ) and to keep him before the public in America , where he had not performed for over four years . 
 During 1957 Gielgud directed Berlioz 's The Trojans at Covent Garden and played Prospero at Drury Lane , but the production central to his career over the late 1950s and into the 1960s was his one @-@ man show The Ages of Man . He first appeared in this in 1956 and revived it every year until 1967 . It was an anthology of Shakespearean speeches and sonnets , compiled by George Rylands , in which , wearing modern evening clothes on a plain stage , Gielgud recited the verses , with his own linking commentary . He performed it all over Britain , mainland Europe , Australasia and the US , including a performance at the White House in 1965 . He found there were advantages to performing solo : " You 've no idea how much easier it is without a Juliet . When there 's a beautiful girl above you on a balcony , or lying on a tomb with candles round her , naturally the audience look at her the whole time , and Romeo has to pull out all the stops to get any attention . " His performance on Broadway won him a Tony Award in 1958 , and an audio recording in 1979 received a Grammy . He made many other recordings , both before and after this , including ten Shakespeare plays . 
 Gielgud continued to try , without much success , to find new plays that suited him as an actor , but his direction of Peter Shaffer 's first play , Five Finger Exercise ( 1958 ) won him another Tony the following year . While in the US for the Shaffer play , Gielgud revived Much Ado About Nothing , this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice . Most of the New York critics praised the production , and they all praised the co @-@ stars . He gave his first performances on television during 1959 , in Rattigan 's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter 's A Day by the Sea for ITV . He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television over the next four decades . 
 = = = 1960s = = = 
 During the early 1960s Gielgud had more successes as a director than as an actor . He directed the first London performance of Britten 's opera A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( 1961 ) at Covent Garden and Hugh Wheeler 's Big Fish , Little Fish on Broadway , the latter winning him another Tony . His performance as Othello at Stratford in the same year was less successful ; Franco Zeffirelli 's production was thought ponderous and Gielgud " singularly <unk> . " As <unk> in The Cherry Orchard to the <unk> of Ashcroft he had the best of the notices ; his co @-@ star and the production received mixed reviews . The following year Gielgud directed Richardson in The School for Scandal , first at the Haymarket and then on a North American tour , which he joined as , in his words , " the oldest Joseph Surface in the business . " 
 In 1962 Gielgud met Martin Hensler ( 1932 – 99 ) , an interior designer exiled from Hungary . He was temperamental , and Gielgud 's friends often found him difficult , but the two became a long @-@ term couple and lived together until Hensler 's death . Under his influence Gielgud moved his main residence from central London to Wotton Underwood in Buckinghamshire . 
 Gielgud received an Oscar nomination for his performance as the King of France in Becket ( 1964 ) . Morley comments , " A minor but flashy role , this had considerable and long @-@ lasting importance ; his unrivalled theatrical dignity could greatly enhance a film . " In 1964 Gielgud directed Richard Burton in Hamlet on Broadway . Burton 's performance received reviews ranging from polite to hostile , but the production was a box @-@ office success , and a film was made of it . Gielgud finally began to take the cinema seriously , for financial and sometimes artistic reasons . He told his agent to accept any reasonable film offers . His films of the mid @-@ 1960s were Tony Richardson 's The Loved One ( 1965 ) , which was a disaster , and Orson Welles 's Falstaff film , Chimes at Midnight ( 1966 ) , which was unsuccessful at the time but has since been recognised as " one of the best , albeit most eccentric , of all Shakespearean movies " , according to Morley . 
 Much of Gielgud 's theatre work in the later 1960s was as a director : Chekhov 's Ivanov at the Phoenix in London and the Shubert in New York , Peter Ustinov 's Half Way Up the Tree at the Queen 's and Mozart 's Don Giovanni at the Coliseum . One potentially outstanding acting role , Ibsen 's Bishop Nicholas , fell through in 1967 when Olivier , with whom he was to co @-@ star at the National Theatre in The Pretenders , was ill . Gielgud played <unk> in Tartuffe and the title role in Seneca 's Oedipus during the National 's 1967 – 68 season , but according to Croall neither production was satisfactory . After this , Gielgud at last found a modern role that suited him and which he played to acclaim : the Headmaster in Alan Bennett 's first play , Forty Years On ( 1968 ) . The notices for both play and star were excellent . In The Daily Telegraph John Barber wrote , " Gielgud dominates all with an unexpected caricature of a mincing pedant , his noble features blurred so as to mimic a fussed and fatuous egghead . From the great mandarin of the theatre , a delicious comic creation . " 
 Having finally embraced film @-@ making , Gielgud appeared in six films in 1967 – 69 . His most substantial role was Lord Raglan in Tony Richardson 's The Charge of the Light Brigade . His other roles , in films including Michael Anderson 's The Shoes of the Fisherman ( 1968 ) and Richard Attenborough 's Oh ! What a Lovely War ( 1969 ) were cameo appearances in character roles . 
 = = = 1970s – Indian summer = = = 
 In 1970 Gielgud played another modern role in which he had great success ; he joined Ralph Richardson at the Royal Court in Chelsea in David Storey 's Home . The play is set in the gardens of a nursing home for mental patients , though this is not clear at first . The two elderly men converse in a desultory way , are joined and briefly enlivened by two more extrovert female patients , are slightly scared by another male patient , and are then left together , conversing even more emptily . The Punch critic , Jeremy Kingston , wrote : 
 At the end of the play , as the climax to two perfect , delicate performances , Sir Ralph and Sir John are standing , staring out above the heads of the audience , cheeks wet with tears in memory of some unnamed misery , weeping <unk> as the lights fade on them . It makes a tragic , unforgettable close . 
 The play transferred to the West End and then to Broadway . In The New York Times Clive Barnes wrote , " The two men , bleakly examining the little nothingness of their lives , are John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson giving two of the greatest performances of two careers that have been among the glories of the English @-@ speaking theater . " The original cast recorded the play for television in 1972 . 
 In the first half of the decade Gielgud made seven films and six television dramas . Morley describes his choice as indiscriminate , but singles out for praise his performances in 1974 as the old Cardinal in Joseph Losey 's Galileo and the manservant Beddoes in Sidney Lumet 's Murder on the Orient Express . In a 1971 BBC presentation of James Elroy Flecker 's Hassan , Gielgud played the Caliph to Richardson 's Hassan . The critic of The Illustrated London News said that viewers would " shiver at a towering performance by Gielgud , as a Caliph with all the purring beauty and ruthlessness of a great golden leopard . " In the theatre Gielgud directed Coward 's Private Lives and Somerset Maugham 's The Constant Wife ( both 1973 , London and 1974 , New York ) . His final production as a director was Pinero 's The Gay Lord Quex ( 1975 ) . 
 Gielgud continued his long stage association with Richardson in Harold Pinter 's No Man 's Land ( 1975 ) directed by Hall at the National . Richardson played Hirst , a prosperous but isolated and vulnerable author , and Gielgud was Spooner , a down @-@ at @-@ heel sponger and opportunist . Hall found the play " extremely funny and also extremely bleak . " The production was a critical and box @-@ office success and , over a period of three years , played at the Old Vic , in the West End , at the Lyttelton Theatre in the new National Theatre complex , on Broadway and on television . In Julian Mitchell 's Half @-@ Life ( 1977 ) at the National , Gielgud was warmly praised by reviewers ; he reprised the role at the Duke of York 's Theatre in the West End in 1978 and on tour the following year . 
 In the latter part of the decade Gielgud worked more for cinema and television than on stage . His film work included what Morley calls " his most embarrassing professional appearance " , in Caligula ( 1979 ) , Gore Vidal 's story of Ancient Rome , spiced with pornographic scenes . In Gielgud 's ten other films from this period , his most substantial role was Clive Langham in Alain Resnais ' Providence ( 1977 ) . Gielgud thought it " by far the most exciting film I have ever made . " He won a New York Film Critics Circle award for his performance as a dying author , " drunk half the time ... throwing bottles about , and roaring a lot of very coarse dialogue . " His other film parts included the Head Master of Eton in Jack Gold 's Aces High ( 1976 ) and Tomlinson in Otto Preminger 's The Human Factor ( 1979 ) . For television his roles included Lord Henry Wotton in The Picture of Dorian Gray ( 1976 ) , John of Gaunt in Richard II ( 1978 ) and Chorus in Romeo and Juliet ( 1978 ) . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 In the 1980s Gielgud appeared in more than twenty films . Morley singles out as noteworthy The Elephant Man ( 1980 ) , Chariots of Fire ( 1981 ) , Gandhi ( 1982 ) , The Shooting Party ( 1984 ) and Plenty ( 1985 ) , directed by David Lynch , Hugh Hudson , Richard Attenborough , Alan Bridges and Fred <unk> respectively . Tony Palmer 's Wagner ( 1983 ) was the only film in which Gielgud , Richardson , and Olivier played scenes together . Gielgud made cameo appearances in films of little merit , lending distinction while not damaging his own reputation . He told an interviewer , " They pay me very well for two or three days ' work a month , so why not ? It 's nice at my age to be able to travel all over the world at other people 's expense . " 
 Gielgud 's most successful film of the decade was Steve Gordon 's Arthur ( 1981 ) , which starred Dudley Moore as a self @-@ indulgent playboy . Gielgud played Hobson , Moore 's butler . He turned the part down twice before finally accepting it , nervous , after the Caligula débâcle , of the strong language used by the acerbic Hobson . He won an Oscar as supporting actor and other awards for the performance . He placed little value on awards , and avoided presentation ceremonies whenever he could : " I really detest all the mutual congratulation baloney and the invidious comparisons which they evoke . " 
 For television Gielgud played nineteen roles during the 1980s ; they included Edward Ryder in an eleven @-@ part adaptation of Waugh 's Brideshead Revisited ( 1982 ) ; The Times said that he gave the role " a desolate and calculated malice which carries almost singlehandedly [ the ] first two episodes " . At the end of the decade he played a rakish journalist , Haverford Downs , in John Mortimer 's Summer 's Lease , for which he won an Emmy Award . 
 Gielgud 's final West End play was Hugh Whitemore 's The Best of Friends ( 1988 ) . He played Sir Sydney Cockerell , director of the Fitzwilliam Museum , in a representation of a friendship between Cockerell , Bernard Shaw and Laurentia McLachlan , a Benedictine nun . Gielgud had some trouble learning his lines ; and at one performance he almost forgot them , momentarily distracted by seeing in a 1938 copy of The Times , read by his character , a review of his own portrayal of Vershinin in Three Sisters fifty years earlier . 
 In 1990 Gielgud appeared in the James Scott @-@ directed Strike It Rich , an adaptation of a Graham Greene novel co @-@ starring Molly Ringwald and Robert Lindsay . That same year he made his last film appearance in a leading role , playing Prospero in Prospero 's Books , Peter Greenaway 's adaptation of The Tempest . Reviews for the film were mixed , but Gielgud 's performance in one of his signature roles was much praised . He continued to work on radio , as he had done throughout his career ; Croall lists more than fifty BBC radio productions of plays starring Gielgud between 1929 and 1994 . To mark his ninetieth birthday he played Lear for the last time ; for the BBC Kenneth Branagh gathered a cast that included Judi Dench , Eileen Atkins and Emma Thompson as Lear 's daughters , with actors such as Bob Hoskins , Derek Jacobi and Simon Russell Beale in supporting roles . He made further cameo appearances on television , and in films including Branagh 's Hamlet ( as King Priam , 1996 ) , Dragonheart ( as the voice of King Arthur , 1996 ) , and Shine ( as Cecil Parkes , 1996 ) . His last feature film appearance was as Pope Pius V in Shekhar Kapur 's Elizabeth ( 1999 ) . In 2000 he had a non @-@ speaking role alongside Pinter in a film of Beckett 's short play Catastrophe directed by David Mamet . 
 Gielgud 's partner , Martin Hensler , died in 1999 . After this , Gielgud went into a physical and psychological decline ; he died in May the following year , peacefully at home , at the age of 96 . At his request there was no memorial service , and his funeral at Wotton parish church was private , for family and close friends . 
 = = Honours , character and reputation = = 
 Gielgud 's state honours were Knight Bachelor ( UK , 1953 ) , Legion of Honour ( France , 1960 ) , Companion of Honour ( UK , 1977 ) , and Order of Merit ( UK , 1996 ) . He was awarded honorary degrees by St Andrews , Oxford and Brandeis universities . 
 From 1977 to 1989 Gielgud was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art — a symbolic position — and was the academy 's first honorary fellow ( 1989 ) . In 1996 the Globe Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue was renamed the Gielgud Theatre . He had not acted on stage for eight years , and felt out of touch with the West End : he commented on the renaming of the theatre , " At last there is a name in lights on the Avenue which I actually recognise , even if it is my own . " 
 Gielgud was uninterested in religion or politics . As a boy he had been fascinated by the rituals at Westminster Abbey , but his brief attraction to religion quickly faded , and as an adult he was a non @-@ believer . His indifference to politics was illustrated at a formal dinner not long after the Second World War when he asked a fellow guest , " Whereabouts are you living now ? " , unaware that , as he was talking to Clement Attlee , the answer was " 10 Downing Street " . In his Who 's Who entry Gielgud listed his hobbies as music and painting , but his concentration on his work , which Emlyn Williams called fanatical , left little scope for leisure activities . His dedication to his art was not solemn . The critic Nicholas de Jongh wrote that Gielgud 's personality was " such infinite , mischievous fun " , and Coward 's biographer Cole Lesley recalled the pleasure of Gielgud 's company , " the words tumbling out of his mouth in an avalanche , frequently having to wipe away his own tears of laughter at the funniness of the disasters he recounted , disasters always against himself . " 
 Together with Richardson and Olivier , Gielgud was internationally recognised as one of the " great trinity of theatrical knights " who dominated the British stage for more than fifty years during the middle and later decades of the 20th century . The critic Michael Coveney wrote , for Gielgud 's ninety @-@ fifth birthday : 
 I have seen Olivier , Ralph Richardson , Alec Guinness and Peggy Ashcroft but John Gielgud is something else . Gielgud is the lone survivor of those great actors whose careers laid the foundation stones of modern theatre . He is acclaimed as the greatest speaker of Shakespearean verse this century . People my age and younger can only take on trust the impact of the Hamlet whose influence lasted more than 30 years . Even the recordings do not quite convey the mellifluous magic of the voice once described by Guinness as a " silver trumpet muffled in silk . " 
 He is indelibly linked with the roles of Prospero and King Lear – regarded as pinnacles of theatrical achievement – yet he is also widely remembered for his wonderful comic touch as Jack Worthing in Wilde 's The Importance of Being Earnest . But his influence goes far beyond his performances . Without Gielgud there would be no National Theatre or Royal Shakespeare Company . He was a pioneer in establishing the first permanent companies in the West End . 
 In an obituary in The Independent Alan Strachan , having discussed Gielgud 's work for cinema , radio and television , concluded that " any consideration of Gielgud 's rich and often astonishing career must return to the stage ; as he wrote at the close of An Actor and his Time ( 1979 ) , he saw the theatre as ' more than an occupation or a profession ; for me it has been a life ' . "

 = Saga ( comic book ) = 
 Saga is an epic space opera / fantasy comic book series written by Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by Fiona Staples , published monthly by the American company Image Comics . The series is heavily influenced by Star Wars and is based on ideas Vaughan conceived both as a child and as a parent . It depicts a husband and wife , Alana and Marko , from long @-@ warring extraterrestrial races , fleeing authorities from both sides of a galactic war as they struggle to care for their daughter , Hazel , who is born in the beginning of the series and who occasionally narrates the series as an unseen adult . 
 The comic was described in solicitations as " Star Wars meets Game of Thrones , " and by critics as evocative of both science fiction and fantasy epics such as The Lord of the Rings and classic works like Romeo & Juliet . It is Vaughan 's first creator @-@ owned work to be published through Image Comics , and represents the first time he employs narration in his comics writing . 
 The first issue of Saga was published on March 14 , 2012 , to positive reviews and a sold @-@ out first printing . It was published in trade paperback form in October 2012 . It has also been a consistent sales success , outselling The Walking Dead , another successful Image comic . 
 The series has been met with wide critical acclaim , and is one of the most celebrated comics being published . It has also garnered numerous awards , including a number of Eisner and Harvey Awards in 2013 , 2014 and 2015 . The first trade paperback collection won the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story . It has also been noted for its diverse portrayal of ethnicity , sexuality and gender social roles , and for its treatment of war . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Writer Brian K. Vaughan conceived Saga in his childhood , calling it " a fictional universe that I created when I was bored in math class . I just kept building it . " He was inspired by such influences as Star Wars , Flash Gordon and children 's books , and has also invoked the awe and wonder of first seeing the Silver Surfer , which seemed an " incredible and different " concept to him . It was not until his wife became pregnant with his second daughter , however , that he conceived of the protagonists , the winged Alana and the horned Marko , two lovers from warring extraterrestrial races who struggle to survive with their newborn daughter , Hazel , who occasionally narrates the series . It was also at this point that the central theme that Vaughan wanted for the book emerged . Vaughan explains , " I wanted to write about parenthood , but I wanted to Trojan @-@ horse it inside some sort of interesting genre story , to explore the overlap between artistic creation and the creation of a child . " Vaughan , who intended to return to writing a comics series following the 2010 conclusion of his previous series , Ex Machina , and who notes that the publication of Saga # 1 coincided with the birth of his daughter , saw parallels between the caution advised by colleagues against launching a new book in the poor economy and those who cautioned against bringing a new child into the world , observing : 
 I realized that making comics and making babies were kind of the same thing and if I could combine the two , it would be less boring if I set it in a crazy sci @-@ fi fantasy universe and not just have anecdotes about diaper bags ... I didn ’ t want to tell a Star Wars adventure with these noble heroes fighting an empire . These are people on the outskirts of the story who want out of this never @-@ ending galactic war ... I ’ m part of the generation that all we do is complain about the prequels and how they let us down ... And if every one of us who complained about how the prequels didn ’ t live up to our expectations just would make our own sci @-@ fi fantasy , then it would be a much better use of our time . 
 Vaughan explained that the main characters ' romance would be a major theme of the book . Touching upon the juxtaposition of the book 's mature subject matter with its Star Wars inspirations , Vaughan jokingly described the book as " Star Wars for perverts . " 
 The book was announced at the 2011 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , and was billed as " Star Wars meets A Game of Thrones " in solicitations . Saga represents the first time Vaughan has employed narration in his comics writing , a decision influenced by the whimsical interaction between the text and images in the children 's books he reads with his children , and by his desire to try something new that he felt would work well with Saga 's narrator , Hazel . It is also his first series to be published through Image Comics , whom he selected as the series ' publisher on the recommendation of writer Jay Faerber , who cited the creative freedom afforded by that publisher . Vaughan elaborated on his selection of Image thus : 
 I love all the other companies I 've worked with , but I think Image might be the only publisher left that can still offer a contract I would consider " fully creator @-@ owned . " Saga is a really important story to me , so I wanted a guarantee of no content restrictions or other creative interference , and I needed to maintain 100 % control and ownership of all non @-@ publishing rights with the artist , including the right to never have our comic turned into a movie or television show or whatever ... [ Image Publisher ] Eric Stephenson was the only publisher I spoke with who was thrilled to make that deal , and co @-@ creator Fiona Staples and I didn 't have to sign exclusives or agree to work on a bunch of corporate @-@ owned titles to get it . 
 Although Vaughan has written for television , and has endeavored to have his previous works adapted into film , he stresses that he developed Saga strictly to be a comic book and not to be adapted to other media , explaining " I wanted to do something that was way too expensive to be TV and too dirty and grown @-@ up to be a four @-@ quadrant blockbuster . " Vaughan has also indicated that he has an ending in mind for the series and that he plans five issues ahead , having written the first six issues as the first story arc , which would have ended with the two main characters dying on the rocketship launch pad in issue 5 if the series had not been successful . By June 2016 , Vaughan indicated that he knew what the last page of the series ' final issue would be . 
 The series is illustrated by Fiona Staples , who was introduced to Vaughan by their mutual friend , writer Steve Niles , with whom Staples worked on Mystery Society . Vaughan , who did not meet Staples in person until just before their panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic @-@ Con , explained his selection of Staples by describing his reaction upon first seeing her work , saying " Her artwork is incredible . [ It ] doesn 't look like anyone else . She is very unique . When I opened up this file I was like , ' This is going to work ! ' " Staples is co @-@ owner of Saga and was given first billing on the cover of issue 31 . In addition to designing all the characters , vehicles and alien races in the story , she provides painted covers and hand @-@ letters Hazel 's narration using her own handwriting , which is the last thing she does after finishing the artwork on a page . Staples renders the characters in a pen @-@ and @-@ ink style line while using all @-@ color settings inspired by video games and Japanese animation . At the 2012 Image Expo , Staples described the process by which she produces her art as harkening back to animation cels , in which emphasis is placed on figures and backgrounds . Vaughan has stated that Staple 's style has influenced the direction of the story . The character <unk> , for example is entirely Staples ' creation . Another example is the organic forms of most of the series ' technology , such as the main characters ' wooden rocket ship , which is derived from Staples ' dislike of drawing mechanical objects . To design the series ' various planetary settings , Staples looks to the real world for inspiration and then exaggerates some elements of them . Some rooms on the planet Cleave , for example , were inspired by Cambodian architecture . 
 The book is priced at $ 2 @.@ 99 and will remain at that price for the duration of its run , which Vaughan arranged as part of his contract with Image along with the stipulation that it never be less than 22 pages long . The first issue features 44 pages of story and no advertisements in both its print and digital versions . At the end of each issue is an old @-@ fashioned letters column called " To Be Continued " which prints readers letters submitted entirely through postal mail as it does not provide an email address for this purpose . Vaughan usually handles the column himself , including responding to letters . 
 The book 's release was celebrated with a launch party at Los Angeles ' Meltdown Comics which featured a public conversation with Vaughan 's former colleague , Lost co @-@ creator Damon Lindelof , who had hired Vaughan as a writer / producer on that series in 2007 . Vaughan also promoted the book by appearing at signings at Midtown Comics in Manhattan and Bergen Street Comics in Brooklyn during the week of the first issue 's release . 
 After the publication of issue 6 in August 2012 , Vaughan announced that the series would take a two @-@ month hiatus , after which the first six @-@ issue story arc was published in trade paperback form in October for $ 9 @.@ 99 before the series ' return in November , a practice that Vaughan and Staples would continue after each successive story arc and trade paperback publication . That same month , Vaughan and Staples promoted the series by appearing together at the 2012 New York Comic Con , their first appearance together since the series ' debut . Some retailers refused to display the trade paperback because its cover ( a reuse of the first issue 's cover ) depicts Alana breastfeeding Hazel . 
 In December 2014 , Image published Saga Deluxe Edition Volume 1 , a hardcover volume collecting the first 18 issues of the series , which comprise its first three story arcs . Because Vaughn sees Saga as a story about Hazel , he and Staples decided to have each new hardcover volume feature an original image of that character at a different stage of her life . Because the first volume covers her birth and infancy , its cover features a closeup of Hazel nursing from her mother 's breast , set against the backdrop of Landfall and Wreath , which recalls the first issue 's cover . Eric Stephenson warned Vaughn and Staples that some retailers and distributors would object to this cover image , thus limiting the series ' audience , but after seeing Staples ' rendition of the image , Stephenson decided that sales would not be a problem . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The opening story arc introduces the series ' leads , Alana and Marko , two lovers from different worlds whose people are at war with one another . Alana comes from the technologically advanced Landfall Coalition , so named after Landfall , the largest planet in the galaxy , and Marko is from Wreath , Landfall 's only satellite , whose people wield magic . Because the destruction of one of the worlds would send the other spinning out of orbit , the war was " outsourced " to other worlds . Although peace was restored on the two home worlds , the conflict spread across all the other known planets , whose native species were forced to choose a side . As Landfall and Wreath were on opposite sides , Alana and Marko met when she was assigned to guard him in a prison on the planet Cleave after he became a prisoner of war . They escaped together twelve hours after meeting . In the beginning of the series ' first issue , Alana gives birth to their daughter , Hazel , who occasionally narrates the series . Their respective peoples are incredulous when it is suggested that they have voluntarily mated and they are pursued by both the <unk> and the Landfallians , both because of the perceived betrayal of the two fugitives and to prevent knowledge of their pairing from spreading and damaging morale among their troops . On Landfall , Prince Robot IV is assigned by his father to capture him and comes into conflict with his counterpart from Wreath , a mercenary named The Will . The ghost of a dead girl named Izabel is bonded to Hazel and the four of them escape Cleave before being joined by Marko 's parents . 
 In the second story arc , more is revealed about Marko 's parents and his upbringing and his initial time with Alana . Marko 's ex @-@ fiancée , Gwendolyn , joins The Will 's hunt as does a six @-@ year @-@ old sex slave rescued by The Will and Gwendolyn who takes the name Sophie . The family later takes refuge at the home of writer D. Oswald Heist ( the author of Alana 's favorite novel ) , where they first come into contact with Prince Robot IV . 
 The third story arc , beginning in August 2013 , which Vaughan intended as a " big tonal shift " , introduces the tabloid journalists Upsher and Doff , as they pursue their own investigation of Alana and Marko , who take refuge at the lighthouse home of author D. Oswald Heist . There , the family first comes into direct contact with , and manages to escape from , Prince Robot IV and Gwendolyn . By the end of the story , Hazel has begun to walk . 
 The fourth story arc establishes the family living on the planet Gardenia , with Alana acting in an underground entertainment program called the Open Circuit in which all the actors wear masks . Hazel is now speaking in simple phrases , while Prince Robot IV 's son is born . A disgruntled robot janitor , Dengo , kills Prince Robot IV 's wife , kidnaps his infant son and journeys to Gardenia , where he kidnaps the family . Marko and Prince Robot IV team up to pursue them . Meanwhile , The Will 's sister , The Brand , teams with Gwendolyn and Sophie to acquire an elixir to heal The Will 's injuries . 
 The fifth story arc begins three months later . The family 's rocketship has set down in a frozen region of a planet , where Dengo meets with revolutionaries who wish to use Hazel as a pawn in their campaign against Landfall and Wreath . Meanwhile , as Marko and Prince Robot IV struggle to maintain their alliance while in pursuit of their kidnapped loved ones , Alana and Yuma both deal with the consequences of their use of the drug <unk> . By end of the arc , Dengo has turned on the revolutionaries , but is himself killed by Prince Robot IV , who is united with his son . Marko and Alana are reunited , but Hazel and Klara are relegated to a <unk> prison . 
 In the sixth story arc , Alana and Marko search for their loved ones who remain incarcerated in a detention center on Landfall . Upsher and Doff resume their investigation of the couple after hearing about The Brand 's death . The journalists , however , are confronted by The Will , who has resumed his vendetta against Robot IV – now called Sir Robot IV – who is now raising his rapidly growing son , Squire . New characters introduced include Hazel 's sympathetic schoolteacher Noreen and a transgender female prisoner , <unk> . The arc closes with Hazel successfully reunited with her parents and the revelation that Alana is once again pregnant .

 Alana - The female lead of the series , Alana is Marko 's wife and Hazel 's mother . She is a native of the planet Landfall , and like all Landfallians she has wings , although her wings do not allow her to fly until issue # 18 . After joining her planet 's war against the <unk> ( one issue says she was drafted after flunking out of state college while another says that she joined the military a few months after her father remarried Alana 's childhood friend , Even ) , she was subsequently reprimanded for " abject cowardice " for hesitating to kill civilians and was redeployed to the planet Cleave , where as a prison guard she met Marko . She developed a friendship with him and when she learned he was to be transferred to a more brutal prison from which detainees never return , she helped him escape - just twelve hours after having met him . She later married him and gave birth to their daughter , Hazel , in the series ' first issue . 
 Marko - The male lead of the series , Marko is Alana 's husband and Hazel 's father . He is from the Landfall 's moon Wreath , whose people have horns or antlers and can wield magic . Marko was a foot soldier in his people 's war against the Coalition of Landfall . Marko was raised since a young age with the knowledge of the atrocities that Landfall committed against their people . When Marko left Wreath as an adult , he was still " a gung @-@ ho kid who just wanted to do [ his ] moon proud and kick some ass . " This changed the first time he saw battle , after which he began to develop a less militant and more pacifist outlook . When he tried to share these misgivings with his fiancée Gwen , he realized from her unsympathetic and jingoistic responses that they had grown too far apart to continue their relationship . Marko surrendered to Coalition forces as a " conscientious objector " 18 months before the beginning of the series . He was a prisoner of war on the planet Cleave until his guard , Alana , escaped with him , married him and conceived their daughter , Hazel . Wreath High Command sent The Will after Marko because Marko " renounced his oath and betrayed The Narrative " by fraternizing with an enemy combatant . Though he is a pacifist who vows upon the birth of his daughter to never again to use his sword , and dislikes the practice of owning firearms , he does so nonetheless when his family is threatened and is so skilled with a sword that he can dispatch an entire squad of enemy soldiers armed with firearms , for which he is referred to by Prince Robot IV as a " force of nature " . 
 Hazel - The daughter of the two lead characters , born in the first issue , who occasionally narrates the series . She has wings like her mother , horns like her father , and green @-@ brown eyes unlike that of either of her parents . She spends most of her childhood growing up in the organic tree @-@ like rocketship with which she and her parents escape Cleave . She is seen taking her first steps at the end of the third story arc , and is speaking in simple phrases by the beginning of the fourth . She celebrates her fourth birthday in the sixth story arc , during a part of her life when she and her grandmother are being held in a <unk> detention center . 
 Izabel - Izabel is the ghost of a teenage girl from the planet Cleave who was killed by a landmine . She manifests as a reddish torso with her intestines hanging out from under the hem of her T @-@ shirt . She comes from a family of resistance fighters who built tunnels to escape people who invaded Cleave . She makes a deal with Alana to save Marko 's life in exchange for being taken with them when they leave the planet , but to do so has to bond her soul to Hazel 's . Although Alana is initially reluctant to allow this , she finally relents and soon comes to appreciate Izabel 's presence since she can act as a " babysitter " at night and allow Alana and Marko to rest . She has the ability to create realistic illusions with which she can disguise her appearance , although these do not work on machines such as the Robots . 
 Klara - Marko 's mother , who first appears with Marko 's father at the end of issue # 6 . Her mother died in an incident at <unk> at the hands of Landfallians , and thus Klara is less accepting of Marko and Alana 's relationship . Brian K. Vaughan , when asked which character was his favorite , stated that Klara was the easiest to write . 
 = = = The family 's pursuers = = = 
 Prince Robot IV - A member of the royal family of the Robot Kingdom , assigned by Landfall as their primary pursuer of Alana and Marko in the beginning of the series when his wife is pregnant with their first child . Like others of his race , he is a humanoid with a small television set for a head , which Vaughan explains is influenced by a fascination with old televisions that he developed when he began writing for TV . He also has blue blood and the ability to morph his right arm into a cannon . In the beginning of the series , Prince Robot IV has just returned from a " two – year tour of hell " after which he had to be given a new leg following a brutal sneak attack . His brain " reboots " after he is injured confronting the family in the third story arc and is still missing when his son is born in the fourth story arc . 
 The Will - One of the freelance bounty hunters hired by the Wreath High Command to kill Marko and Alana and bring Hazel back alive , not only for Marko 's betrayal but also to prevent news of Alana and Marko 's coupling from spreading and thus threatening troop morale . The Will is accompanied by a Lying Cat , a large talking feline that can detect lies . Vez , the woman who hires him , says she hired The Will because he shares Marko 's moral relativism . When he travels to the sexually permissive planet Sextillion and is presented with a six @-@ year @-@ old sexual slave girl , The Will kills her pimp . The Will was once the lover of The Stalk , a female spider @-@ like bounty hunter who is also assigned to Alana and Marko until she is killed by Prince Robot IV , for which The Will vows revenge . He develops an attraction to Gwendolyn even as he mourns The Stalk . His sister Sophie , who addresses him " Billy " and who introduced him to The Stalk , is another Freelancer who works under the name The Brand . In the third story arc , he decides to abandon his Freelancer life but suffers a near @-@ fatal injury . Although his life is saved at a hospital , it is said that he will likely never fully recover from the trauma . 
 Lying Cat - Lying Cat is a large female talking feline companion to The Will who aids him in his work . Green in color and with yellow stripes , she has the ability to detect when a verbal statement is a lie , which she indicates by saying " Lying " . Her power is limited to the state of the mind of the person speaking : she can detect deliberate deception , but cannot detect a falsehood if a given statement is believed to be true by the speaker . According to Izabel , Lying Cats always play by the rules , an allusion to the fact that a Lying Cat must also admit ethical truths as well as factual ones . When Gwendolyn , who becomes Lying Cat 's ally , accidentally kills a man , Izabel says that they had no right to execute that man in his home , which Lying Cat could not deny . It has been revealed that Lying Cat was the runt of her seven @-@ kitten litter , which has caused her distress . 
 Sophie - A six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year @-@ old former sex slave , initially known only as Slave Girl , that The Will discovers on the pleasure planet Sextillion . He and Gwendolyn rescue her , after which the girl reveals she possesses the power of <unk> , with which she helps The Will track Marko and Alana . The Will decides to name her Sophie in issue # 13 , which is the same name as his sister . Vaughan has stated that Sophie , whose first appearance Staples initially refused to draw , was created to illustrate the horrific effects of war and as a critique of the sexualized portrayal of Princess Leia as Jabba the Hutt 's slave in the film Star Wars : Return of the Jedi , explaining " That 's that character at her least sexy . There are slave girls in the world and they don 't look like Princess Leia in a bikini . " 
 Gwendolyn - Marko 's former fiancée , who joins The Will 's pursuit of the family . Gwendolyn first appears at the end of issue # 8 , having been assigned by the Secretary General of Wreath High Command to check on The Will and helps him rescue Slave Girl from Sextillion in order to spur him to complete his mission . Marko and Alana 's wedding rings , which also function as translator devices , were originally those of Gwendolyn 's grandparents , who had the rings enchanted with a translator spell because they spoke two different dialects of Wreath 's native language . She wears her grandparents ' translation pendant around her neck , which were forged with the rings as part of the same set . She resists The Will 's advances , though she reveals she loves him while attempting get medical attention for him after he suffers a near @-@ fatal injury . 
 Upsher and Doff - Upsher and Doff are a tabloid journalist and photographer , respectively , from the planet Jetsam , who work for a tabloid called The Hebdomadal , and who are also lovers . First appearing in issue # 13 , their speech , like all people from Jetsam , is rendered in the form of blue text surrounded by speech balloons that more closely resemble traditional comics thought bubbles . Jetsam is a partially underwater society , as its natives possess an amphibious physiology , and are capable of surviving in and out of water . Upsher and Doff experience more than one confrontation with Freelancers hired to put an end to their investigation . The Brand poisons them with <unk> , a substance that will kill them if they report their findings about the family to anyone else , though they attempt to find a way around this in order to continue their investigation . After they learn The Brand is dead , they attempt to resume their investigation , but are confronted by The Will , who drafts them into his service .

 Although issue # 7 sold out , Image Comics PR & Marketing Director Jennifer <unk> announced in a December 12 , 2012 letter to retailers that it would not reprint select comics , such as that issue . <unk> explained the move as a result of decreasing orders on well @-@ performing titles like Saga , despite critical acclaim and consistently selling out at a distributor level , and pointed to orders on Saga # 8 , which decreased 4 % from orders on issue # 7 . Rather than invest in second printings , <unk> explained , Image would instead focus its attention on ensuring that the first printing garners the sales desired . This move displeased some retailers , which prompted Image Publisher Eric Stephenson to announce the following day that Image would indeed publish a second printing of issue # 7 at a considerable discount , but cautioned that the publisher would not be able to reprint every issue of the series indefinitely , and implored retailers not to under @-@ order the series . 
 The second trade paperback collection immediately appeared at the top of the New York Times graphic books best @-@ seller list .

 The series was met with wide critical acclaim and is one of the most celebrated comics being published . It holds an average score of 9 @.@ 0 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup . This score is held by both the regular series and the collected volumes . 
 The first issue was widely acclaimed in publications such as Publishers Weekly , MTV , Ain 't it Cool News , Complex magazine , Comic Book Resources , iFanboy and ComicsAlliance ; they all praised Vaughan 's ability to incorporate elements of different genres , establishing the vast setting and mythology , and introducing characters that engaged the reader . Multiple reviewers likened the book to a combination of sci @-@ fi / fantasy works such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings and classic works of literature such as Romeo and Juliet , Hamlet and the New Testament . AICN singled @-@ out the use of the newborn Hazel as a lone individual to chronicle large @-@ scale events from a past perspective , and Alex Zalben of MTV Geek remarking that he could hear a John Williams score as he read the book . Multiple reviewers also lauded Vaughan for beginning the story with Hazel 's birth rather than hurting the story 's pace with copious exposition of Alana and Marko 's initial meeting and courtship . Todd Allen of The Beat approved of the book 's unique " flavor " , singling out the characters ' motivations , the <unk> of its surrealist setting , the strangeness of the story 's various oddities and the timely nature of the story 's political undertones . Both Alex Evans of Weekly Comic Book Review and P. S. Hayes of Geeks of Doom called the series a " classic " ; Hayes also praised Image Comics for publishing such an " original " series . Also widely praised was Fiona Staples ' artwork , which was characterized as " glorious " , with Zalben predicting that readers would " fall head over heels in love " with it , and Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources positively comparing it to that of <unk> Francis Yu , specifically her use of delicate lines to frame characters with large , bold figures and Staples ' mixture of the familiar and the foreign together in her character designs to create a visually cohesive universe . AICN singled out Staples ' handling of grand , sweeping space shots and other genre trappings , as well as her mastery of facial expressions - which AICN felt was perfectly suited to Vaughan 's subtle dialogue . Todd Allen of The Beat wrote that Staples ' landscapes at times play as much a part in the story as the foreground . 
 The subsequent issues that made up the series ' initial six @-@ issue story arc also garnered similarly positive reviews , with three printings ordered for issue # 2 , and second printings ordered for issues 3 - 6 . The series was included in IGN 's 2012 list of " The Comics We 're Thankful For This Year " and took the # 1 spot in CBR 's " Top 10 Comics of 2012 " . In August 2013 , Douglas Wolk of Time magazine referred to the series as a " breakout hit " , calling it " mischievous , vulgar and gloriously inventive . " 
 Joseph McCabe of The Nerdist included the hardcover Saga Deluxe Edition Volume 1 in their Top 5 Comic Reprint Collections of 2014 . That same year , Laura Sneddon of the British Science Fiction Association 's journal Vector listed Saga among her list of six groundbreaking science fiction comics .

 On April 9 , 2013 , media reported that Apple Inc. had prohibited the sale of issue 12 of Saga through iOS , because two panels that depicted oral sex between men in a small , in @-@ set image violated Apple 's restrictions on sexual content . This resulted in criticism by artists and writers , who pointed to similarly explicit content in previous issues and in other works sold through iTunes . William Gibson and others suggested that the restriction could have occurred specifically because the drawings in question depicted gay sex . A day later , digital distributor <unk> announced that it had been they , not Apple , who had chosen not to make the issue available based on their interpretation of Apple 's rules , and that after receiving clarification from Apple , the issue would now be sold via iOS . 
 In 2014 the series was included on the American Library Association 's list of the ten most frequently challenged books that year . It had been challenged for containing nudity and offensive language and for being " anti @-@ family , ... sexually explicit , and unsuited for age group . "

 Although interest has been expressed in adapting Saga for film or TV , Vaughan and Staples reaffirmed their desire not to do so in an August 2013 interview , with Vaughan stating that the point of Saga as he conceived it was " to do absolutely everything I couldn 't do in a movie or a TV show . I 'm really happy with it just being a comic . " Vaughan has stated that they are open to the possibility , though it is not a priority for them . However , merchandise based on the series has been produced , including a line of T @-@ shirts featuring Lying Cat , which have become visible in popular media . In " Pac @-@ Man Fever " , the April 24 , 2013 episode of the American TV series Supernatural , the character Charlie Bradbury ( played by Felicia Day ) is seen wearing a Lying Cat T @-@ shirt . Day , who has referred to Saga as the " best comic EVER " , indicated that show writer Robbie Thompson picked out the shirt . 
 In 2015 , Skybound Entertainment began taking pre @-@ orders for an 8 ” tall , hand @-@ painted Lying Cat resin statue , which retails for $ 75 . In February 2016 , Essential Sequential began taking orders for a posable , 19 @-@ inch tall <unk> Lying Cat doll that says , " Lying " when its collar is pressed , scheduled to ship that May . Later that June , Skybound announced that at the following month 's San Diego Comic @-@ Con , it would debut action figures based on the two lead characters , Alana and Marko , by McFarlane Toys . The five @-@ inch figures are issued together in a two @-@ pack , and are paired with a mace and a sword . 
 The controversial cover of the comic 's first issue was referenced in " The <unk> <unk> " , the February 4 , 2016 episode of the American TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory . In the episode , Claire ( Alessandra Torresani ) , a new patron of Stuart 's comics shop , is reading the first trade paperback of the series ( which features the same cover as its first issue ) , and Raj <unk> ( Kunal Nayyar ) responds to this by observing , " Not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover . " Though the The Big Bang Theory is often criticized for its portrayal of comic book fans , according to Comic Book Resources , a Twitter search indicated reaction to the scene by fans of Saga readers who saw it was mostly positive .

 = Doug Ring with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = 
 Doug Ring was a member of Donald Bradman 's famous Australian cricket team which toured England in 1948 . Bradman 's men went undefeated in their 34 matches ; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles . 
 A leg spinner , Ring was not prominent in the team 's success . Regarded as the last bowler to be selected for the team , Ring played in only the Fifth Test , taking one wicket for 44 runs ( 1 / 44 ) for the match and scoring nine runs in his only innings after replacing off spinner Ian Johnson , who was dropped for poor form . Along with Ron Hamence and Colin McCool , neither of whom played in a Test during the tour , Ring called himself " ground staff " because of the paucity of the trio 's on @-@ field duties in the major matches and they often sang ironic songs about their status . 
 For the entire tour , Ring took 60 first @-@ class wickets at a bowling average of 21 @.@ 81 , the most expensive among Australia 's frontline bowlers . As England agreed to have a new ball available 55 overs after the start of each innings in the Tests — more frequently than usual — fast bowling dominated over spin , and Ring was used primarily in the non @-@ Test tour matches . Outside the Tests , only Bill Johnston bowled more overs , and Ring was used to relieve the workload on Bradman 's pace spearheads to keep them fresh for the Tests . Ring scored 150 first @-@ class runs at a batting average of 16 @.@ 66 during the tour , and a top @-@ score of 53 was his only effort beyond 50 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ring made his Test debut in last international match of the 1947 – 48 Australian season , the Fifth Test against India . Australia rested a few of its players and some fringe cricketers such as Ring and Sam Loxton were given a debut so that their ability could be evaluated before the tour of England . Ring took six wickets for the match and was selected for the tour along with Loxton , who scored 80 . 
 = = Early tour = = 
 Australia traditionally fielded its first @-@ choice team in the tour opener , which was customarily against Worcestershire . Ring was omitted from this match , despite having replaced Colin McCool to make his Test debut in the fifth and final match against India in Australia during the 1947 – 48 season that preceded the tour of England ; Ring had taken six wickets for 120 runs ( 6 / 120 ) . Fellow leg spinner McCool and off spinner Ian Johnson — who had been regular Test players since World War II — were the two slow bowlers picked as Australia started their campaign with an innings victory . 
 Ring was called into the team for the second tour match against Leicestershire . He made two runs with the bat before being run out as Australia ended on 448 . Ring took two top order wickets to leave the hosts at 3 / 56 before returning to take three late wickets as Leicestershire lost their last four wickets without addition to be all out for 130 . Ring ended with 5 / 45 . Made to follow on , Leicestershire scored 147 and lost by an innings . Ring failed to add to his wicket tally in the county 's second innings , conceding 26 runs . Ring was rested for the next match against Yorkshire , on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling . It was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour , as they scraped home by four wickets in a low scoring affair . The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval , and Ring made two in the tourists ' 632 . He then took 3 / 34 in the first innings , removing Arthur McIntyre , Alec Bedser and Jim Laker . He bowled five wicketless overs in the second innings as Surrey were defeated by an innings . Ring then took 1 / 18 and 0 / 52 from a total of 44 overs as Australia amassed 4 / 414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings . 
 In the following match , Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs , its largest winning margin for the summer . On the first day , Australia set a world record by scoring 721 , the most first @-@ class runs made in a single day 's play , but Ring was unable to contribute to the surfeit of scoring , making only one . He bowled 18 overs and conceded a total of 35 runs without success as the hosts were bowled out for 83 and 187 . This was followed by another innings victory , this time over Oxford University . After having failed to score more than two runs in any of his first three innings of the tour , Ring came to the wicket at 7 / 317 and scored 53 , adding 87 runs in partnership with fellow Victorian Sam Loxton before being bowled . After Australia were out for 431 , Ring took a match total of 1 / 51 , removing Geoffrey Keighley as the hosts made 185 and 156 . 
 The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , N- and were basically a full strength Test team , while Australia fielded their first @-@ choice team . It was a chance for both teams to gain a psychological advantage . At this point of the tour , Ring had only taken ten wickets at an average of 28 @.@ 30 , while McCool had taken 17 at 14 @.@ 35 . McCool retained the first @-@ choice leg spinner 's position and took 4 / 35 as Australia won by an innings . 
 Ring was rested for Australia 'a first non @-@ victory of the tour , a rain @-@ affected draw against Lancashire . He returned for the match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge , which was also drawn . Ring took 2 / 31 in the first innings , both of his victims being stumped , as the hosts made 179 , before making an unbeaten nine in Australia 's reply of 400 . He then shouldered the heaviest workload as Nottinghamshire made 8 / 299 in the second innings , the highest score against the Australians thus far on the tour . Ring bowled 43 overs and took 4 / 104 . He removed Joe Hardstaff junior , who had made the first century against Australia for the season , triggering a collapse that saw the loss of four wickets for 27 runs to leave the hosts at 8 / 289 . He also dismissed future Test batsman Reg Simpson for 70 . The hosts were 32 runs short of making Australia bat again , but held on for a draw as time ran out . 
 Against Hampshire , Ring took 1 / 19 as the home team made 195 after being put into bat on a drying pitch . He made a duck as Australia collapsed to 117 to trail by 78 runs , the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead during the English summer . Ring was not required to bat in the Australian second innings , as Hampshire were bowled out for 103 in 42 @.@ 5 overs and Australia then reached their target of 182 to win by eight wickets . Ring had a final chance to push for Test selection in the innings win over Sussex , the last match before the First Test . He bowled only two wicketless overs as the pacemen skittled the hosts for 86 , and did not bat as Australia amassed 5 / 549 declared . He then took three consecutive wickets as Sussex fell from 5 / 98 to 8 / 109 before eventually being bowled out for 138 . Ring ended with 3 / 42 from 13 overs . 
 = = Test omission = = 
 Ring 's performances were not enough for him to take McCool 's place in Bradman 's first @-@ choice team . Instead , Bill Johnston , who had taken 10 / 40 against Yorkshire and 11 / 117 against Hampshire on damp surfaces , was given the place on the opening morning of the First Test when rain appeared likely . Johnston then took nine wickets in Australia 's victory , cementing his position in the team . This left Ring jostling with the other spinners — Johnson and McCool — for one spot in the Test team . 
 After the First Test , Ring returned to action as Australia completed an innings victory over Northamptonshire . He took 1 / 31 in the hosts ' first innings of 119 , before making an unbeaten 16 in partnering McCool in an unbroken stand of 39 as Australia declared at 8 / 352 . In the second innings , he took four of the last five wickets and ended with 4 / 31 as Northamptonshire collapsed from 5 / 142 to be all out for 169 . This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire , in which Ring scored three runs and was not asked to bowl in the first innings . Yorkshire were bowled out for 206 from 90 @.@ 1 overs ; Bradman called on Ernie Toshack and Johnston to bowl 81 @.@ 1 overs and did not entrust the other bowlers with substantial work . Ring then took 1 / 22 in the second innings as the match petered out into a draw . 
 Ring was overlooked for the Second Test at Lord 's as Bradman retained the same XI , despite the incumbent spinner Johnson managing only 1 / 85 in the First Test . Australia won convincingly by 409 runs . The next match was against Surrey , starting the day after the finish of the Test . Ring took 3 / 51 from 21 @.@ 2 overs in the first innings , leading the way in terms of wickets and overs ; most of the Test bowlers were given a light workload . He then contributed an unbeaten 15 in Australia 's first innings of 389 . After Australia took a first innings lead of 168 , Ring bowled another 24 overs in the second innings and took 1 / 54 . He twice dismissed Jack Parker , who had top @-@ scored in each innings with 76 and 81 . Australia then chased down the 122 runs for victory in less than an hour , to complete a 10 @-@ wicket win . 
 In the match against Gloucestershire immediately before the Third Test , Ring did not bat as Australia reached 7 / 774 declared , which was their highest score of the tour and which underpinned an innings victory . Ring took two wickets in the space of three runs , including Test batsman Charlie Barnett , to end with 2 / 83 in 25 overs as the hosts made 279 . After stand @-@ in captain Lindsay Hassett enforced the follow on — Bradman had rested himself — Ring removed Test batsmen Barnett and George Emmett to leave Gloucestershire at 2 / 20 . After resting he resumed bowling with the score at 4 / 93 and took three more wickets , as the hosts fell to 9 / 109 and then 132 all out . Ring took 5 / 47 and bowled the most overs ( 25 ) in the second innings . Johnson , however , took 11 / 100 in the match and retained his place in the team for the Third Test at Old Trafford . The Test was drawn amid inclement weather . 
 Ring then played against Middlesex in Australia 's only match before the Fourth Test . He took one wicket in each innings for a match total of 2 / 57 . After only scoring two in the first innings , Ring opened the batting with McCool in the second innings , with a target of only 22 runs . They promptly reached the target without loss , with Ring unbeaten on 15 . This was not enough for Ring to force his way into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley . Australia persisted with the same bowling attack and posted 3 / 404 in the second innings , setting a world record for the highest successful run @-@ chase to win a Test . Former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O 'Reilly criticised the Australians for using only one spinner , pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood @-@ Smith , a left @-@ arm wrist spinner , had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo @-@ Australian Test at Headingley in 1938 . O 'Reilly cited the 1934 Headingley Test the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia , and said that at least one of McCool or Ring , should have played alongside Johnson . England had been at 2 / 423 in their first innings , before collapsing to be 496 all out ; O 'Reilly blamed Australia 's lack of early success on the absence of a leg spinner , attributing England 's collapse to inept batting . 
 Immediately after the Headingley Test , Ring scored four as Australia amassed 456 against Derbyshire . He bowled the most overs in the first innings , taking 3 / 73 from 24 overs as the hosts made 240 . He then took 0 / 23 from six overs after Australia enforced the follow on and ultimately won the match by an innings . In the next match against Glamorgan , Ring led the bowling with 3 / 34 , including the wicket of opposition captain Wilf Wooller as the hosts folded for 197 . Ring did not bat , as rain ended the match early , with Australia 's score at 3 / 215 . Ring was then rested for the match against Warwickshire , which Australia won by nine wickets . 
 Bradman recalled Ring as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour . Ring scored 17 not out as Australia made 321 ; he then dismissed Test players Ken Cranston ( who was captaining Lancashire ) and Dick Pollard , to end with 2 / 25 in the first innings . In the county 's second innings Ring bowled 22 of the 57 overs during which Australia reduced Lancashire to 7 / 199 before time ran out . He took 2 / 88 , including the wicket of Cranston for the second time . In a non @-@ first @-@ class match against Durham , the last fixture before the Fifth Test , Ring made an unbeaten single as Australia scored 282 . He then took 1 / 24 as the hosts fell to 5 / 73 in their first innings , before rain washed out the match . 
 = = Fifth Test = = 
 After taking only seven wickets at 61 @.@ 00 in the first four Tests , Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval ; Ring replaced him as the team 's spinner . English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain @-@ affected pitch , which was regarded as a surprising move by the majority of the press corps . Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield , which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss . 
 Along with the effects of the rain on the pitch , the humid conditions assisted the Australian fast bowlers , who were able to make the ball bounce at variable heights . Led by Lindwall , who took 6 / 20 , Australia skittled England for 52 , and Ring did not get a chance to bowl . Ring then made nine before being caught by Jack Crapp in the slips as Australia replied with 389 . England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears late on day two and resumed at 1 / 54 the next morning . During the first session , Ring bowled a tidy spell of 13 overs as Denis Compton and Len Hutton added only 67 runs for the session . Ring did not bowl consistently or accurately , and although the batsman hit him regularly , they did not place their shots , which often went to the fielders . There were four men in the off side ring and they had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly . The English batsmen progressed steadily although Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton . Later in the day , Ring dismissed debutant Allan Watkins for two to take his only wicket of the match . Watkins lofted a delivery from Ring to the leg side straight into the hands of Hassett , who did not need to move from his position on the boundary , leaving England at 6 / 167 . The hosts were eventually bowled out early on the fourth morning for 188 , sealing defeat by an innings and 149 runs . Ring had taken 1 / 44 after sending down the most overs in the innings ( 28 ) , including 13 maidens . 
 = = Later tour matches = = 
 After the Fifth Test seven matches remained on Bradman 's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat . Australia rested Ring for the match against Kent , which Australia won by an innings . This was followed by a game against the Gentlemen of England , the leading amateurs in the country . Ring was not required to bat as Australia amassed 5 / 610 before declaring . He then bowled the most overs in the first innings , sending down 25 @.@ 3 and taking the wickets of English Test batsmen Bill Edrich , Trevor Bailey and Freddie Brown . Ring ended with 3 / 74 as the hosts were bowled out for 245 . Australia enforced the follow on and Ring again shouldered the heaviest workload . He removed Reg Simpson to break the opening stand of 60 . The Gentlemen progressed to 3 / 217 before Ring dismissed Edrich for 128 , followed by George Mann for a duck without further addition to the score . Ring then bowled Yardley and dismissed Wilf Wooller soon after , leaving the hosts at 7 / 240 ; they were eventually all out for 284 , which sealed an innings victory for Australia . Ring ended with 5 / 70 from 32 overs . The following match against Somerset followed a similar pattern . Ring did not bat as Australia declared at 5 / 560 . He then took 2 / 17 in the first innings and was not required to bowl in the second innings as the hosts collapsed for 115 and 71 to cede another innings victory . 
 Ring was rested for the match against the South of England . Australia declared at 7 / 522 before the hosts made 298 ; rain ended the match before the second innings could start . Australia 's biggest challenge in the post @-@ Test tour matches was against the Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI . During the previous Australian tour of England in 1938 , this team was effectively a full @-@ strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play for the hosts . Bradman then fielded a full @-@ strength team . He made only one change from the team that won the Fifth Test , dropping Ring for Johnson . Australia led by 312 runs on the first innings before persistent rain ended the match . 
 The tour ended with two non @-@ first @-@ class matches against Scotland . In the first , Ring made an unbeaten three as Australia scored 236 . He bowled five overs without success in the first innings , before removing four of the first five batsmen in the second innings and ending with 4 / 20 . Scotland made 85 and 111 to lose by an innings . In the second match , Ring was the costliest bowler in the first innings , conceding 42 runs without success in Scotland 's 178 . After Australia declared at 6 / 407 , Ring took the leading figures of 4 / 30 , including the wickets of both openers as Australia ended the tour with another innings triumph . 
 = = Role = = 
 Although the 1948 tour of England was an unprecedented triumph for the Australians , Ring 's leg spin was not prominent in the success . He jostled with McCool and Johnson for a position as Bradman selected only one specialist spinner in the Tests . <unk> by Lindwall , Miller and Johnston , the faster bowlers dominated the bowling attack . With a new ball allowed at intervals of 55 overs in Tests , a period that usually elapsed sooner than the 200 runs stipulated under the usual rule of the time , spinners were given few opportunities and made little impact in the big matches . Bradman and his fellow tour selectors — vice @-@ captain Lindsay Hassett and Arthur Morris — picked a pace @-@ dominated attack to exploit the more frequently shiny ball , as a new ball swings and seams more for fast bowlers , while slower bowlers can impart more spin with a worn ball . In its summary of the tour , Wisden said that Ring " was never a trump card in the pack " . Such was the strength of the bowling that Ring 's 60 first @-@ class wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 81 made him the most expensive of the regular bowlers on the tour . Among the seven frontline bowlers , Ring 's strike rate of 54 @.@ 26 was the second least incisive and his economy rate of 40 @.@ 20 was the second most expensive . Although McCool was less economical , he had the second highest strike rate , and while Toshack had the worst strike rate , he was the second most economical of the Australians in the first @-@ class fixtures . 
 Ring did most of his work in the non @-@ Test first @-@ class matches , in which he sent down 3 @,@ 088 deliveries . This was second only to Johnston , who bowled 3 @,@ 251 . In contrast , Lindwall and Miller sent down only 2 @,@ 105 and 1 @,@ 749 deliveries outside the Tests respectively , as Bradman sought to preserve them for hostile bursts with the new ball against England . Along with Lindwall , Ring was the equal third highest wicket @-@ taker in first @-@ class matches excluding the Tests , with 59 scalps , doing a large part of the work in the county matches so that the leading bowlers could conserve energy for the Tests . 
 Ring had limited opportunities with the bat . Along with Toshack and Johnston , he invariably batted in the bottom three <unk> This was because Australia 's other frontline bowlers tended to be capable with the bat ; Lindwall , Miller , and McCool all made Test centuries and more than nine triple @-@ figure first @-@ class scores , with the latter pair averaging over 30 in Tests . Johnson passed fifty on 21 occasions in his first @-@ class career , six of them in Tests . The strength of the batting side meant that Ring batted only 14 times in his 19 first @-@ class matches on the tour , as Australia often batted only once and won by an innings , and several times declared their first innings closed before Ring could bat . Ring scored 150 runs at 16 @.@ 66 , an aggregate and average better than only Toshack 's . He passed 50 only once , and his tour batting average was lower than his career benchmark of 23 @.@ 25 . Ring also took 12 catches . 
 Ring and fellow fringe members of the squad McCool and Ron Hamence , would refer themselves as the " ground @-@ staff " , as it was unlikely that the tour selectors would include them in the Test team during the tour . The trio were known to sing ironic songs about the paucity of their on @-@ field duties during the tour .

 = <unk> catshark = 
 The blackmouth catshark ( Galeus melastomus ) is a species of catshark , and part of the family Scyliorhinidae , common in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Senegal , including the Mediterranean Sea . It is typically found over the continental slope at depths of 150 – 1 @,@ 400 m ( 490 – 4 @,@ 590 ft ) , on or near muddy bottoms . The youngest sharks generally inhabit shallower water than the older juveniles and adults . This slim @-@ bodied species is characterized by the black interior of its mouth , a marbled pattern of pale @-@ edged brownish saddles or blotches along its back and tail , and a prominent saw @-@ toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin . It reaches lengths of 50 – 79 cm ( 20 – 31 in ) , with sharks in the Atlantic growing larger than those in the Mediterranean . 
 Slow @-@ swimming but active , the blackmouth catshark is a generalist that preys on a wide variety of crustaceans , cephalopods , and fishes . Its visual and electroreceptive systems are adept at tracking moving , bioluminescent prey . This species is oviparous , with females producing batches of up to 13 egg cases throughout the year . Because of its abundance , the blackmouth catshark forms a substantial part of the bycatch of deepwater commercial fisheries across much of its range . It has low economic value and is usually discarded , though the largest sharks may be marketed for meat and leather . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed this species under Least Concern , as there is no indication that its numbers have declined despite fishing pressure . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 Constantine Samuel Rafinesque briefly described the blackmouth catshark in his 1810 <unk> di alcuni <unk> <unk> e nuove specie di <unk> e <unk> della Sicilia : con <unk> <unk> sopra i <unk> , wherein he referenced the distinctive black interior of its mouth ( from which the specific epithet melastomus is derived ) . No type specimen was designated . This species may also be called the black @-@ mouthed dogfish . A 2005 phylogenetic analysis that included five Galeus species , based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA , found that G. melastomus forms a clade with G. murinus , apart from the clade of G. <unk> , G. gracilis , and G. <unk> . The oldest documented blackmouth catshark fossils come from the northern Apennines and date to the Lower Pliocene ( 5 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 6 Ma ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The blackmouth catshark is widely distributed in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean , from southwestern Iceland and Trondheim , Norway southward to Senegal , including the Faroe Islands , the British Isles , the Azores , and the northern portion of the Mid @-@ Atlantic Ridge . It occurs throughout the Mediterranean Sea , save for the northern waters of the Adriatic and Aegean Seas , and is absent from the Black Sea . This species primarily inhabits the continental slope , at depths of 150 – 1 @,@ 400 m ( 490 – 4 @,@ 590 ft ) . However , it has been documented from water as shallow as 20 – 25 m ( 66 – 82 ft ) in Norway , and as deep as 2 @,@ 300 – 3 @,@ 850 m ( 7 @,@ 550 – 12 @,@ 630 ft ) in the eastern Mediterranean . The depths at which it is most common vary between regions , for example 300 – 500 m ( 980 – 1 @,@ 640 ft ) in the Bay of Biscay , 400 – 800 m ( 1 @,@ 300 – 2 @,@ 600 ft ) off Portugal , 500 – 800 m ( 1 @,@ 600 – 2 @,@ 600 ft ) in the Strait of Sicily , 1 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 400 m ( 3 @,@ 300 – 4 @,@ 600 ft ) in the Catalan Sea , and 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 830 m ( 4 @,@ 920 – 6 @,@ 000 ft ) in the eastern Mediterranean . Water temperature does not appear to be an important factor in determining the distribution of this species . 
 Found on or near the bottom , the blackmouth catshark favors a muddy habitat . There is little evidence for segregation by sex . A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles . Other studies though have found no such pattern . It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages . Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths , while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water . If true , the age @-@ depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling .

 The reported maximum lengths attained by the blackmouth catshark varies from 67 to 79 cm ( 26 to 31 in ) for Atlantic sharks and 50 to 64 cm ( 20 to 25 in ) for Mediterranean sharks ; a length record of 90 cm ( 35 in ) may be dubious . Females attain a larger ultimate size than males . The maximum weight on record is 1 @.@ 4 kg ( 3 @.@ 1 lb ) . This species has a slender , firm body with a rather long , pointed snout comprising roughly 6 – 9 % of the total length . The anterior rim of each nostril bears a large triangular flap , which divides the nostril into incurrent and excurrent openings . The eyes are horizontally oval and equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) . Beneath each eye is a subtle ridge , and behind is a small spiracle . The mouth forms a short , wide arch , and bears moderately long furrows around the corners . The upper and lower jaws contain around 69 and 79 tooth rows respectively . Each tooth is small , with a narrow central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side . There are five pairs of gill slits , with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin bases . 
 The two dorsal fins are roughly equal in size and placed far back on the body : the first originates behind the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases and the second behind the midpoint of the anal fin base . The pectoral fins are large , while the pelvic fins are small and low , with angular margins . The anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin ; its base measures 13 – 18 % of the total length and greatly exceeds the distance between the pelvic and anal fins , or between the dorsal fins . The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed , with the end of the anal fin very close to the caudal fin . The caudal fin comprises around a quarter of the total length ; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip , while the lower lobe is indistinct . The skin is very thick and covered by well @-@ calcified dermal denticles . There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles , resembling saw teeth , along the upper edge of the caudal fin . The body is grayish @-@ brown above , with 15 – 18 dark , rounded saddles , blotches , and / or spots that run onto the tail ; each marking is highlighted by a paler border . The underside is white , as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins . The inside of the mouth is black . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Within its range , the blackmouth catshark is one of the most abundant sharks over the upper and middle continental slope . It is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups . Relatively slow , this shark swims with strong eel @-@ like ( <unk> ) undulations of its body . It often cruises just above the sea floor , perhaps taking advantage of the ground effect ( a reduction in the drag on a wing when close to the ground ) to save energy . It has also been seen resting motionless on the bottom . Known predators of the blackmouth catshark include the kitefin shark ( Dalatias licha ) and the European flying squid ( Todarodes <unk> ) . Parasites that have been documented from this species include the tapeworm <unk> <unk> and the protist Eimeria <unk> . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The blackmouth catshark is an active , generalist predator that feeds on both bottom @-@ dwelling and free @-@ swimming organisms . Its diet is dominated by decapods , krill , bony fishes ( including lanternfishes , bristlemouths , dragonfishes , and <unk> ) , and cephalopods . The most significant prey species generally reflect what is most available in the environment , for example the shrimps <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> off southern France and the prawns <unk> <unk> and <unk> robusta off the Iberian Peninsula . Juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults , including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods . Adults favor relatively large fish prey and have been known to take other sharks and rays and smaller members of the same species . The importance of cephalopod prey across ages differs between regions . The stomachs of some blackmouth catsharks have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm , suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups . Scavenging has been infrequently documented , including of human refuse . 
 When foraging , the blackmouth catshark swings its head from side to side to employ its senses more effectively . It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food , and less on smell . As in most sharks , its visual acuity is greatest along the median horizontal plane . The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large , allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background . The rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence , which is exhibited by most of the organisms it hunts . For electroreception , the blackmouth catshark has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged , which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast @-@ moving prey . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Unlike most members of its genus , the blackmouth catshark exhibits multiple <unk> , in which more than one egg can mature within each oviduct simultaneously . Females may contain up to 13 developing eggs , though 1 – 4 per oviduct is typical . The number of eggs laid annually per female has been estimated at between 60 and 100 , increasing with female size . Only the right ovary is functional in mature females . The egg case is vase @-@ shaped and bears a slight flange along the lateral margins ; the anterior end is squared off , with a pair of stubby , coiled horns at the corners , while the posterior end is rounded . The surface of the case is somewhat translucent , smooth , and glossy . The case is a golden brown color when first laid , and becomes dark brown in sea water . Egg cases produced by Atlantic sharks measure 3 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 6 in ) long and 1 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 0 cm ( 0 @.@ 55 – 1 @.@ 18 in ) across . Those produced by Mediterranean sharks tend to be smaller at 4 @.@ 2 – 5 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 in ) long and 1 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 67 – 0 @.@ 98 in ) across . Larger females produce slightly larger egg cases . 
 Mating and egg @-@ laying proceeds year @-@ round ; reproductive activity is highest in winter and summer , though not all studies have found such a seasonal pattern . The eggs are deposited on muddy substrates in relatively shallow water . Maturation size varies between geographical regions , and is generally larger in the Atlantic than in the Mediterranean . Lengths at maturity for males and females have been variously reported from 48 to 79 cm ( 19 to 31 in ) and 56 to 79 cm ( 22 to 31 in ) respectively in the Atlantic , and from 42 to 55 cm ( 17 to 22 in ) and 39 to 61 cm ( 15 to 24 in ) respectively in the Mediterranean . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Harmless to humans and of little economic value , the blackmouth catshark is caught incidentally in large numbers by commercial bottom trawl and longline fisheries . In particular , it is among the most commonly <unk> sharks in trawls targeting deepwater lobsters and shrimps ( Nephrops norvegicus , <unk> longirostris , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ) , operating off Portugal and in the Mediterranean . Most captured sharks are discarded , probably with heavy mortality . Some fisheries , such as those off Portugal and Italy , retain and utilize a small subset of the largest individuals for human consumption fresh or dried and salted , and for leather ; the fishing fleet of Viareggio , Tuscany reported landing 700 kg ( 1 @,@ 500 lb ) in 2005 . In the northeastern Atlantic , this shark is being increasingly targeted by fishers following the decline of other deepwater shark species . 
 Off Corsica , Sicily , and southern Portugal , and in the Ionian , southern Adriatic , and Aegean Seas , most of the blackmouth catsharks captured are immature , suggesting there has been a negative impact of fishing pressure . However , the species remains extremely abundant in a number of areas , and survey and fishery data have not shown any evidence of overall population decline . The wide range of depths it occupies likely afford it some protection against fishing , particularly given a 2005 ban on trawling deeper than 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) in the Mediterranean . Therefore , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the blackmouth catshark under Least Concern . In the waters of the European Commission , fishing for this species is managed as part of the Total Allowable Catch ( TAC ) for deepwater sharks . 
 = New York State Route 359 = 
 New York State Route 359 ( NY 359 ) is a state highway located entirely within the town of Skaneateles in Onondaga County , New York in the United States . At 1 @.@ 71 miles ( 2 @.@ 75 km ) in length , it is one of the shortest signed state highways in all of New York . The route begins at NY 38A a half @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) north of the Onondaga @-@ Cayuga County county line and ends at NY 41A in the hamlet of Mandana . It lies between Skaneateles Lake and Owasco Lake . Excluding its termini , there are only two junctions with other roadways along the entire route . NY 359 was assigned in the early 1940s and was part of the original NY 26 from 1924 to 1930 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 359 begins in the town of Skaneateles at an intersection with Heifer Street , a local road , and NY 38A . The route goes north , intersecting with Weeks Road 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 1 @.@ 0 km ) north of NY 38A . Here , NY 359 begins to curve to the east with Weeks Road carrying on the northward alignment of NY 359 . Upon meeting Lacy Road , the route takes over its east – west routing and heads east . NY 359 comes to an end just under a mile later at NY 41A in the lakeside hamlet of Mandana . East of NY 41A , the roadway continues for roughly 400 feet ( 120 m ) to a boat launch on the western shore of Skaneateles Lake , 1 @.@ 71 miles ( 2 @.@ 75 km ) from NY 38A . 
 Signed as a north – south route , it lies that way at the southern end , but about midway along its length the road turns and thence travels east – west . Excluding its termini , there are only two junctions with other roadways along the entire route . It is the only instance in New York of a route designated without an alphabetic suffix that terminates at both ends at suffixed routes . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of NY 359 date back to the assignment of the first state routes in New York in 1924 . At this time , all of modern NY 359 became part of NY 26 , a highway that continued north along what is now NY 41A toward the village of Skaneateles and south on modern NY 38A toward the village of Moravia . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 26 was reassigned elsewhere in the state . Its former routing was incorporated into several new routes , including part of NY 38A from Moravia to the modern junction of NY 38A and NY 359 and part of NY 41A from Mandana to Skaneateles . The portion that is now NY 359 , however , received no designation and became unnumbered . It was designated as NY 359 in the early 1940s .

 = Edward Low = 
 Captain Edward " Ned " Low ( also spelled Lowe or Loe ; ca . 1690 – ca . 1724 ) was a notorious English pirate during the latter days of the Golden Age of Piracy , in the early 18th century . He was born around 1690 into poverty in Westminster , London , and was a thief from an early age . Low moved to Boston , Massachusetts , as a young man . His wife died in childbirth in late 1719 . Two years later , he became a pirate , operating off the coasts of New England and the Azores , and in the Caribbean . 
 He captained a number of ships , usually maintaining a small fleet of three or four . Low and his pirate crews captured at least a hundred ships during his short career , burning most of them . Although he was active for only three years , Low remains notorious as one of the most vicious pirates of the age , with a reputation for violently torturing his victims before killing them . 
 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle described Low as " savage and desperate , " and a man of " amazing and grotesque brutality " . The New York Times called him a torturer , whose methods would have " done credit to the ingenuity of the Spanish Inquisition in its darkest days " . The circumstances of Low 's death , which took place around 1724 , have been the subject of much speculation . 
 = = Early life = = 
 According to Charles Johnson 's A General History of the Pyrates , Edward Low was born in Westminster , London , England , around 1690 . He was described as illiterate , having a " quarrelsome nature " , and always ready to cheat , running " wild in the streets of his native parish " . As a young man , he was said to be a pickpocket and gambler , playing games of chance with the footmen of the nearby House of Commons . 
 Most of his family appear to have been thieves . While young , his brother , Richard , was small for his age and is said to have been carried around in a basket on a friend 's back ; in a crowd , Richard would snatch the hats and wigs of passers @-@ by . Richard Low later took to other forms of criminal activity and ended up hanged at Tyburn in 1707 for the burglary of a house in Stepney . 
 = = Life in Boston = = 
 As he grew older , Low tired of pickpocketing and thievery and turned to burglary . Eventually , he left England , and travelled alone to the New World around 1710 . He spent three to four years in various locations , before settling in Boston , Massachusetts . On 12 August 1714 , he married Eliza Marble at the First Church of Boston . They had a son , who died when he was an infant , and then a daughter named Elizabeth , born in the winter of 1719 . 
 Eliza died in childbirth , leaving Low with his daughter . The loss of his wife had a profound effect on Low : in his later career of piracy , he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind , and refused to press @-@ gang married men into joining his crews . He would also allow women to return to port safely . At first working honestly as a rigger , in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras , where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston . 
 Low was employed as a patron , supervising the loading and carrying of the logs . One day , he returned to the ship when hungry , but was told by the captain he would have to wait to eat , and that he and his men would have to be satisfied with a ration of rum . At this , Low " took up a loaded musket and fired at the captain but missed him , [ and ] shot another poor fellow through the throat " . 
 Following this failed mutiny , Low and his friends were forced to leave the boat . A day later , Low led the twelve @-@ man gang — which included Francis Farrington Spriggs , who went on to become a notorious pirate in his own right — in taking over a small sloop off the coast of Rhode Island . Killing one man during the theft , Low and his crew turned pirate , determined " to go in her , make a black Flag , and declare War against all the World . " 
 = = Piracy = = 
 = = = Lieutenant = = = 
 Low , using his newly captured ship , lay in wait on the popular shipping route between Boston and New York . Within a few days , he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island , and plundered it . His crew cut the rigging away to prevent the sloop returning too quickly to port to raise the alarm . He then captured a number of unarmed merchantmen near Port Rosemary . 
 Low headed south and began operating in the waters of Grand Cayman , with a period as lieutenant to the established pirate George Lowther , who captained the Happy Delivery , a 100 @-@ ton Rhode Island sloop with eight cannon and ten swivel guns . When she was " destroyed by Indians " , Lowther and his crew transferred to a sloop named the Ranger . Lowther 's crew was constantly expanded by desperate sailors willing to join him . Fast acquiring a taste for cruelty , Low taught Spriggs a torture technique which involved tying a victim 's hands with rope between their fingers and setting it alight , burning their flesh down to the bones . 
 Following a number of successful raids , Lowther eventually captured a large 6 @-@ gun brigantine ( named Rebecca ) on 28 May 1722 . He gave it to Low to captain . With a crew of 44 , Low amicably dissolved his partnership with Lowther . 
 = = = Pirate captain = = = 
 In one notable raid in June 1722 , Low and his crew attacked thirteen New England fishing vessels sheltering at anchor in Port <unk> , Shelburne , Nova Scotia . Although outnumbered , Low hoisted his Jolly Roger flag and declared that no mercy would be given to the fishermen if any resisted . The fleet submitted and Low 's men robbed every vessel . Low chose the largest , an 80 @-@ ton schooner which he renamed The Fancy and armed with 10 guns , to become his flagship . 
 He sank the other ships of the fleet , and abandoned the Rebecca . The Boston News Letter of 9 July 1722 published a list of those captured by Low . A number of the fishermen were forced to join Low , including Philip Ashton who escaped in May 1723 on Roatán Island in the Bay Islands of Honduras , and who wrote a detailed account of life aboard Low 's pirate ship . Before Ashton 's escape , he had been beaten , whipped , kept in chains , and threatened with death many times , as he refused to sign Low 's articles and become a pirate . 
 Low 's tactics consisted primarily of hoisting false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel . Off the coast of St John 's , Newfoundland , Low mistook a fully armed man @-@ of @-@ war for a fishing boat , and barely escaped . He moved on to Conception Bay , capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores . There , he captured a French ( or Portuguese — sources differ ) pink , a narrow @-@ <unk> former man of war , which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship , naming it the Rose Pink . 
 He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard . Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times , until they died . He moved on to the Canaries , Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil , where he was driven back by foul weather . 
 Low abandoned his plans for plundering the rich shipping trade off the coast of Brazil , and moved on to the Caribbean . George Roberts , a mate on the British ship King Sagamore , recounted a meeting with Low aboard the Pink . Roberts ' ship was captured by Low 's fleet , of which he was now styling himself " Commodore " . 
 = = = <unk> of the Rose Pink = = = 
 Forty leagues ( 120 nautical miles or around 220 km ) to the east of Surinam , Low and his fleet of two ships ( the Rose Pink and the Fancy , captained by a young Charles Harris ) dropped anchor to remove growth such as seaweed and barnacles from the outside of the boats , in a process known as careening , necessary because no dry dock was available to pirates . 
 Still relatively inexperienced , Low ordered too many men to the outside of the boat to work on the buildup , and the Rose Pink tipped over too far . The portholes had been left open , and the vessel took on water and sank , with the death of two men . The Pink had been carrying most of the provisions , and Low — by now captaining a captured schooner , the Squirrel — and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a pint ( around 275 ml ) per man , per day . 
 Failing to reach their initial destination of Tobago due to light winds and strong currents , Low 's depleted fleet made it to Grenada , a French @-@ owned island . Hiding most of his men belowdecks , he was permitted to send men ashore for water . The following day , a French sloop was sent out to investigate , but was captured when Low 's men came out from hiding . Low , now commanding the captured sloop ( renamed the Ranger ) , gave the schooner Squirrel to his quartermaster , Spriggs , who renamed it the Delight before sailing away in the middle of the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs ' crew .
