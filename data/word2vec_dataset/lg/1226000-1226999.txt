 = Warcraft : Orcs & Humans = 
 Warcraft : Orcs & Humans is a real @-@ time strategy game ( RTS ) , developed by Blizzard Entertainment and published by Blizzard and Interplay Entertainment . The MS @-@ DOS version was released on 23 November 1994 and the Macintosh version in late 1996 . Sales were fairly high , reviewers were mostly impressed , and the game won three awards and was a finalist for three others . There was a CD re @-@ release , namely version 1 @.@ 21 ( CD version ) , that didn 't have the word @-@ from @-@ the @-@ user @-@ manual copy protection of prior versions . The sequel , Warcraft II : Tides of Darkness , became the main rival to Westwood Studios ' Command & Conquer series , and this competition fostered an RTS boom in the mid to late 1990s . 
 Although Warcraft : Orcs & Humans was not the first RTS title to offer multiplayer games , Blizzard 's game persuaded a wider audience that multiplayer facilities were essential for future RTS titles . The game introduced innovations in mission design and gameplay elements , which were adopted by other RTS developers . 
 Blizzard 's main emphases in these games were on skillful management of relatively small forces and on development of characterization and storyline within and between games played in the same universe . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Warcraft : Orcs & Humans is a real @-@ time strategy game ( RTS ) . The player takes the role of either the Human inhabitants of Azeroth , or the invading Orcs . In the single player campaign mode the player works through a series of missions , the objective of which varies , but usually involves building a small town , harvesting resources , building an army and then leading it to victory . In multiplayer games , the objective is always to destroy the enemy players ' forces . Some scenarios are complicated by the presence of wild monsters , but sometimes these monsters can be used as troops . The game plays in a medieval setting with fantasy elements . Both sides have melee units and ranged units , and also spellcasters . 
 = = = Modes = = = 
 Warcraft : Orcs & Humans 's gameplay expands the Dune II " build base , build army , destroy enemy " paradigm to include other modes of game play . These include several new mission types , such as conquering rebels of the player 's race , rescuing and rebuilding besieged towns , rescuing friendly forces from an enemy camp and then destroying the main enemy base , and limited @-@ forces missions , in which neither side can make further units , and making efficient use of one 's platoon is a key strategy element . In one mission , the player has to kill the Orc chief 's daughter . 
 The game also allows two players to compete in multiplayer contests by modem or local networks , and enables gamers with the MS @-@ DOS and Macintosh version to play each other . Multiplayer and AI skirmishes that are not part of campaigns were supported by a random map generator . The game also allowed spawn installations to be made . 
 = = = Economy and power = = = 
 Warcraft requires players to collect resources , and to produce buildings and units in order to defeat an opponent in combat . Non @-@ combatant builders deliver the resources to the Town Center from mines , from which gold is dug , and forests , where wood is chopped . As both are limited resources which become exhausted during the game , players must collect them efficiently , and also retain forests as defensive walls in the early game when combat forces are small . 
 The lower @-@ level buildings for Humans and Orcs have the same functions , but different sprites . The Town Hall stores resources and produces units that collect resources and construct buildings . Each Farm provides food for up to four units , and additional units cannot be produced until enough Farms are built . The Barracks produces all non @-@ magical combat units , including melee , ranged , mounted , and siege units . However all except the most basic also need assistance from other buildings , some of which can also upgrade units . 
 Each side can construct two types of magical buildings , each of which produces one type of spellcaster and researches more advanced spells for that type . These advanced buildings can be constructed only with assistance from other buildings . The Human Cleric and Orc <unk> can both defend themselves by magic and also see distant parts of the territory for short periods . The Cleric 's other spells are protective , healing the injured and making troops invisible , while the <unk> raises skeletons as troops and can make other units temporarily invulnerable , at the cost of severely damaging them when the spell dissipates . The Human Conjurer and Orc Warlock have energy blasts , wider @-@ range destruction spells and the ability to summon small , venomous monsters . The Conjurer can summon a water elemental , while the Warlock can summon a demonic melee unit . 
 = = = User interface = = = 
 The main screen has three areas : the largest , to the right , is the part of the territory on which the player is currently operating ; the top left is the minimap ; and , if a building or unit ( s ) is selected , the bottom left shows their status and any upgrades and the actions that can be performed . The status details include a building 's or unit 's health , including its progress if being constructed , and any upgrades the object has completed . The Menu control , at the very bottom on the left , provides access to save game , load game and other menu functions . 
 Initially most of the main map and minimap are blacked out , but the visible area expands as the player 's units explore the map . The mini @-@ map shows a summary of the whole territory , with green dots for the player 's buildings and units and red dots for enemy ones . The player can click in the main map or the minimap to scroll the main map around the territory . 
 All functions can be invoked by the mouse . Keys can also invoke the game setup , some of the menu options and some gameplay functions including scrolling and pausing the game . Players can select single units by clicking , and groups of up to four by shift @-@ clicking or <unk> . To move units , players can shift the mouse to select units on the main map , move to the unit menu to select an action , and then back to the main map or minimap to specify the target area ; but shortcut keys can eliminate the middle mouse action in this cycle . 
 = = Storyline = = 
 The Orcs originated from another world <unk> , where the orcs , once a peaceful race , gone bloodthirsty from the blood of a <unk> . However , their Warlocks remained aloof , devoting their time to the research of magic . The Warlocks noticed a rift between the dimensions and , after many years , opened a small portal to another world . One Warlock explored and found a region , whose Human inhabitants called it " Azeroth " , from which the Warlock returned with strange plants as evidence of his discovery . 
 The Orcs enlarged the portal until they could transport seven warriors , who massacred a Human village . The raiding party brought back samples of good food and fine <unk> , and a report that the Humans were defenseless . The Orcs ' raiding parties grew larger and bolder , until they assaulted Azeroth 's principal castle . However , the Humans had been training warriors of their own , especially the mounted , heavily armed Knights . These , assisted by Human Sorcerers , gradually forced the Orcs to retreat through the portal , which the Humans had not discovered . 
 For the next fifteen years , one faction of Orcs demanded that the portal be closed . However a chief of exceptional cunning realized that the Humans , although out @-@ numbered , had prevailed through the use of superior tactics , organization , and by magic . He united the clans , imposed discipline on their army and sought new magics from the Warlocks and Necromancers . Their combined forces were ready to overthrow the Humans .

 The first RTS games appeared in the early 1980s or even in the 1970s , and others followed in the early 1990s . However , Westwood Studios 's Dune II , released for DOS in 1992 , established the pattern of modern RTS games . Blizzard Entertainment was surprised that no further RTS titles appeared in 1993 and early 1994 – although in fact Westwood had quietly been working on Command & Conquer since the completion of Dune II . To take advantage of the lull in RTS releases , Blizzard produced Warcraft : Orcs & Humans . While later " ... craft " games were famous for complex stories presented lavishly , the first member of the series had no script and was improvised in the recording studio by one of the game 's producers . The contract composer Gregory Alper wrote music that Blizzard staff found reminiscent of Holst 's The Planets . Demos in summer 1994 whetted appetites for the completed game , released for MS @-@ DOS in November 1994 and for the Macintosh in 1996 . The game was published by Blizzard in North America and by Interplay Entertainment in Europe , and Sold @-@ Out Software republished the MS @-@ DOS version in March 2002 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Warcraft : Orcs & Humans became by far the company 's greatest success to that date , and for the first time made the company 's finances secure . In November 1995 Entertainment Weekly reported that the game ranked 19th of the top 20 CDs across all categories . 
 Although reviews did not appear until months later , MobyGames 's collection of reviews shows scores from 92 % to 75 % , except that MobyGames estimated a score of 40 % for a Swedish review . In Dragon Paul Murphy described the game as " great fun – absorbing and colorful , " and Scott Love praised its solid strategy , simple interface and fantasy theme . Warcraft : Orcs & Humans won PC Gamer ’ s Editors ' Choice Award , Computer Life ’ s Critics ' Pick and the Innovations Award at the Consumer Electronics Show , Winter 1995 . It was a finalist for Computer Gaming World ’ s Premier award , PC Gamer ’ s Strategy Game of the Year and the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences 's Best Strategy award . 
 The early stage of a game can be slow , as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources , and then start building combat units . Meanwhile the AI does not have to spend as much effort on gathering resources and often starts with more buildings , which forces the player to spend more of each contest on the defensive . 
 While the basic units of the two sides were identical , the more advanced forces favored the Orcs , especially the Daemon , summoned by the Orc Warlock . 
 The user interface had an unsophisticated appearance , but worked in most respects . However the selecting of no more than four units at a time was restrictive . Gamers found the play hard work , as often two or three of the gamer 's units would attack without orders , while the rest still did nothing , and buildings could also lie idle without orders . There was no queuing of construction or research . 
 Some reviewers thought the game 's AI was unintelligent and predictable , and one wished for a facility to set the difficulty level . Others found the AI 's raids were well managed , and usually found the weaknesses in the gamer 's position . One reviewer found pathfinding adequate , while others found it very poor , and one considered this as typical of RTS games . 
 On both the DOS and Macintosh versions , the game ran very slowly during large battles . 
 The good stereo sound helped gamers to locate events that occurred outside the current <unk> . Some reviewers like units ' speech effects , especially in response to repeated clicks , while others found this monotonous . Game Revolution ’ s review of the Mac version complained that Warcraft : Orcs & Humans ’ s graphics , which were ported from the DOS version 's VGA , did not exploit the Macintosh 's superior resolution . However , Game Revolution and Mac Gamer agreed that visual shortcomings did not reduce Mac gamers ' enjoyment of the engrossing gameplay . Both also complained that the Macintosh was released about a year later than the DOS version .

 = = = Predecessors and innovations = = = 
 The first RTS game was developed in the 1970s on a mainframe , and RTS for home computers appeared in the early 1980s . Dune II , released in 1992 , established conventions that most subsequent RTS games followed , including the " collect resources , build base and army , destroy opponents " pattern . Warcraft : Orcs & Humans , two years later , was the next well @-@ known RTS game , and introduced new types of missions , including conquering rebels of the player 's race and limited @-@ forces missions , in which neither side could make further units . It also included skirmishes which were single @-@ player games that were not part of a larger campaign . To support multiplayer and skirmishes , Warcraft : Orcs & Humans used a random map generator , a feature previously seen in the turn @-@ based strategy game Civilization . In 1995 Westwood 's RTS Command & Conquer series adopted the use of non @-@ standard mission types and skirmishes , and Microsoft 's Age of Empires included these features and a random map generator in 1997 . 
 Modem Wars , released in 1988 for DOS and the Commodore 64 , was the first RTS with multiplayer games by means of modems . Warcraft : Orcs & Humans , which allow two gamers to compete by modem or local networks , persuaded a wider audience that multiplayer competition was much more challenging than contests against the artificial intelligence ( AI ) , and made multiplayer facilities essential for future RTS titles . 
 Realms , released in 1991 for DOS , Amiga and Atari ST , had a medieval theme , with melee and ranged units , and allowed gamers to resolve combat automatically or in a RTS @-@ type style . Warcraft : Orcs & Humans was the first typical RTS to be presented in a medieval setting , and its units included spellcasters as well as melee and ranged units . 
 = = = Sequels = = = 
 The success of Warcraft : Orcs & Humans motivated Blizzard to publish a sequel , Warcraft II : Tides of Darkness , in December 1995 , and an expansion pack , Warcraft II : Beyond the Dark Portal , in 1996 . In autumn 1995 Westwood had released Command & Conquer , and the competition between these two sequels made the RTS genre popular , and defined the genre . Blizzard 's new game 's enhancements included : naval and air units , supported by new buildings and a new resource , oil ; excellent artwork rendered in SVGA graphics ; improved sound including additional responses from units ; a much better AI ; and new mechanisms such as <unk> ( moving continuously along a route for surveillance or defense ) . A further generation of the Warcraft : Orcs & Humans lineage , called Warcraft III : Reign of Chaos , was released in July 2002 , and gained instant and enduring acclaim with both critics and players . 
 In April 1998 Blizzard released StarCraft , an RTS with the concepts and mechanisms of Warcraft but an interplanetary setting and three totally different races . Starcraft and its expansion StarCraft : Brood War were well received by critics , and became very successful . World of Warcraft , released in North America in November 2004 and in Europe in February 2005 , was Blizzard 's first attempt at a massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game , and used the universe of the Warcraft RTS games , including characters that first appeared in Warcraft : Orcs & Humans . <unk> was praised highly by critics , was the most popular MMORPG in 2008 , and in 2007 became the most profitable video game ever created . 
 Beyond video games , Warcraft franchises include board games , card games , books , and comics . 
 = = = Blizzard style of RTS games = = = 
 Warcraft : Orcs & Humans was a moderate critical and commercial success , and laid the ground for Blizzard 's style of RTS , in which personality was a distinctive element . The increasingly humorous responses to clicking a unit repeatedly became a trademark of the company . Warcraft : Orcs & Humans introduced characters that also appeared in the enormously successful massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game World of Warcraft . The company 's manuals presented detailed backstories and artwork . StarCraft used a futuristic theme , but placed the same emphasis on characterization . In all the Blizzard RTS games and in World of Warcraft , units must be managed carefully , rather than treated as expendable hordes . Blizzard has produced fewer expansion packs than Westwood , but integrated the story of each with its predecessors . 
 = Cyclone Joy = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Joy struck Australia in late 1990 , causing the third highest floods on record in Rockhampton , Queensland . This cyclone began as a weak tropical low near the Solomon Islands , and initially moved westward . On 18 December , it was named Joy , becoming the 2nd named storm of the 1990 – 91 Australian region cyclone season . After turning southwest , Joy developed a well @-@ defined eye and strengthened to maximum sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 103 mph ) while approaching Cairns in Far North Queensland . Brushing the city with strong winds , the cyclone soon weakened and turned southeast . Joy later curved back southwest , making landfall near Townsville , Queensland on 26 December . It dissipated the next day ; remnant moisture continued as torrential rainfall over Queensland for two weeks . 
 While drifting offshore northeastern Australia , the cyclone produced wind gusts as high as 124 km / h ( 77 mph ) in Cairns , strong enough to cause power outages . In Mackay , a tornado spawned by Joy damaged 40 homes , while torrential rainfall just south of the city peaked at over 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . Most storm @-@ associated damage was wrought by severe flooding , which persisted for weeks in hardest @-@ hit locations . Rains significantly increased water levels on 10 rivers , among them the Fitzroy River , which discharged about 18 trillion litres ( 4 @.@ 8 × 1012 US gallons ) of freshwater into Keppel Bay over 25 days . In turn , the Great Barrier Reef suffered biological damage from coral bleaching and decreased salinity . The Fitzroy River rose to a 9 @.@ 30 @-@ metre ( 30 @.@ 5 ft ) peak at Rockhampton , forcing thousands to evacuate homes ; some stranded individuals could only obtain food by helicopter . Elsewhere in Australia , storm moisture alleviated drought conditions and diminished fires near Sydney . Overall , Joy killed six people and caused A $ 300 million in damage ( $ 234 million USD ) . Afterwards , the Queensland government issued a disaster declaration for about 30 % of the state , and the name Joy was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In mid @-@ December , a monsoon trough persisted along the west Pacific Ocean , spawning a pair of tropical disturbances both north and south of the equator . In the northwestern Pacific Ocean , the system became Typhoon Russ . On 15 December , a tropical low formed east of the Solomon Islands . During the next few days , the system passed south of the country while slowly organizing . On 18 December , the Australia Bureau of Meteorology began tracking it , naming the system " Joy " after it upgraded the low to tropical cyclone status . A meteorologist from Darwin later apologised that the name was used so close to Christmas , although " Joy " was predetermined by a rotating list of list of tropical cyclone names . Also on 18 December , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began issuing warnings on the storm , labeling it as Tropical Cyclone 06P . With a ridge to the south , Joy continued generally west @-@ southwestward . 
 While in its origins , Joy was experiencing upper @-@ level wind shear , but as it approached the jet stream while turning to the southwest , conditions became more favourable for intensification . The storm quickly intensified , reaching the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on 21 December . At 00 : 00 UTC on 23 December , the Bureau estimated Joy reached peak 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 103 mph ) , which made the system a category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale . Around the same time , the JTWC also estimated the same peak winds , but sustained over one minute . Joy developed an eye about 50 km ( 31 mi ) in diameter with concentric eyewalls . The storm began moving slowly off the northeast coast of Australia , passing within 100 km ( 62 mi ) of Cairns , and the motion shifted to a southeast drift . A building high pressure area to the south caused the change in movement , and there were initial concerns the storm would loop to the west and affect Cairns again . Drier air caused Joy to weaken gradually from its peak to the equivalent of a strong tropical storm . At 06 : 00 UTC on 26 December , after turning back to the southwest , the storm made landfall near Townsville , Queensland , with winds estimated at 95 km / h ( 59 mph ) . That day , the JTWC discontinued advisories , and on 27 December , Joy dissipated inland over Queensland . A remnant system persisted into early January , producing continued rainfall across Queensland . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Before Joy struck Australia , residents evacuated from resorts on Fitzroy and Green islands by boat or plane . Officials set up evacuation centres on the mainland and put the Australian Army on standby . The military evacuated its fleet of Blackhawk helicopters inland from RAAF Base Townsville . A man required rescue from Hope Island by helicopter in advance of the storm . The threat of the storm caused shopping malls and the airport near Cairns to close just before Christmas . Several flights were diverted or delayed , stranding about 1 @,@ 000 travellers , many of whom spent Christmas in the airport . Road travel was banned in some areas of northeastern Queensland , and residents in Port Douglas were forced to evacuate . The Flood Warning Centre in Brisbane issued 192 flood warnings related to Cyclone Joy in December and January , beginning on 23 December . Most of the warnings were related to increased water levels along rivers . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Joy passed within 80 km ( 50 mi ) of Green Island off the coast of Queensland , generating a wind gust of 180 km / h ( 110 mph ) . Heavy damage occurred on other islands , and one person drowned while surfing in Mackay . A boat became disabled during the storm , forcing its four occupants to ride out the storm for four days on Cockermouth Island until they were rescued by helicopter . Several boats were damaged in the Whitsunday Islands . 
 The storm and its remnants dropped heavy rainfall throughout Queensland for about two weeks , totaling over 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) south of Mackay and over 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) between Bowen and St. Lawrence . The highest daily total was 458 mm ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) about 30 km ( 19 mi ) west of Sarina . Three day rainfall totals around when Joy made landfall included 831 mm ( 32 @.@ 7 in ) in Blue Mountain and 506 mm ( 19 @.@ 9 in ) in <unk> . Rainfall continued through the region through March 1991 , resulting in the third largest flood in the region in over 100 years . 
 Overall , Cyclone Joy killed six people , including five in river flooding , and caused about A $ 300 million in damage ( $ 234 million USD ) . While stalling off the northeast Australia coast , Joy produced widespread gale force winds , with gusts to 124 km / h ( 77 mph ) recorded at Cairns . After the winds knocked over trees , causing power and phone outages , storm damage cut the water supply and briefly isolated Cairns due to debris blocking roads . An outer rainband struck Mackay as the storm moved ashore , spawning a tornado that damaged 40 houses , destroyed two others , and damaged a caravan park . The windstorm was unexpected there , and damage in Mackay was estimated at A $ 10 million . Flooding from rainfall affected about 90 % of the city , which restricted train travel , causing three trains to be canceled and stranding hundreds of travelers . In Port Douglas , Joy produced an inconsequential storm surge of 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) . In Innisfail , the cyclone ruined 90 % of the town 's crops , and over 20 houses sustained wind damage . Banana farmers in the Cairns region lost a combined total of 1 @.@ 2 million bunches of the fruit . Collectively , crop damage totalled over A $ 70 million , mostly to sugar cane and banana . About 30 @,@ 000 head of livestock were killed in the region . 
 Rain from Cyclone Joy caused rampant flooding across the region , significantly raising water levels along 10 rivers . The Fitzroy River alone swelled to inundate about 4 @,@ 000 km2 ( 1 @,@ 500 sq mi ) of terrain . Heightened discharge caused extensive erosion along river channels that removed about 18 million tonnes ( 20 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 short tons ) of soil and vegetation . In late December , the Pioneer River at Mackay peaked at 7 @.@ 6 m ( 25 ft ) , safely within the confines of its levee system . The town of <unk> endured flooding of streets and houses , which would reoccur several times through February . High water levels along the Tully River flooded a portion of the Bruce Highway . In the second week of January , the Herbert River peaked at 11 @.@ 32 m ( 37 @.@ 1 ft ) , causing residential flooding in Ingham . Elsewhere in Australia , moisture from the storm eased ongoing bushfires near Sydney . 
 At Rockhampton , the Fitzroy River rose to an initial peak of 9 @.@ 15 m ( 30 @.@ 0 ft ) , temporarily dropped , and rose to a final peak of 9 @.@ 30 m ( 30 @.@ 5 ft ) in early January 1991 , the third highest since records began in 1860 , after floods in 1918 and 1954 . Inflow from several tributaries ensured the Fitzroy River near Rockhampton remained over 8 m ( 26 ft ) for 13 days . The river entered 350 houses in what was the city 's most damaging flood since 1954 . The town was isolated for about three weeks after flooding covered roads , railways , and the airport . Before the worst of the flooding , Acting Premier Tom Burns declared a state of disaster for Rockhampton , giving local police the authority to force individuals living in flood zones to leave their homes . Ultimately , over 1 @,@ 000 people sought higher ground , staying mainly at the houses of friends or relatives , or at nearby schools . In an attempt to mitigate damage , 150 volunteers filled 43 @,@ 000 sandbags to protect properties . Nearby , residents rescued about 100 dogs from an affected kennel . 
 Storm @-@ related flooding damaged portions of the Great Barrier Reef through coral bleaching . Over 25 days , the Fitzroy River discharged about 18 trillion litres ( 4 @.@ 8 × 1012 US gallons ) of water into Keppel Bay , reaching the Great Barrier Reef in early January and causing a drop in salinity levels . On Great Keppel Island , about 85 % of shallow @-@ water reefs died . Reef damage also occurred in the Whitsunday Islands . The discharge from the Fitzroy River affected various islands and coral groups , depending on the offshore wind direction and ocean current . The water flow washed a group of freshwater turtles from the mainland to North West Island , though they were later returned to their native habitat . The influx of freshwater reduced commercial fishing productivity by 30 % .

 Workers in Cairns had restored power and water supplies within a few days of Joy 's passage . After the initial flooding from Joy ended , there was additional rainfall in February 1991 that caused flooding across the region . Residual flooding cost the coal industry about A $ 60 million due to loss of production and hindered exporting . While Rockhampton was still isolated by flooding , a helicopter airdropped food to hundreds of stranded families , after the town experienced food and water shortages . Transportation to Rockhampton was not normalised until 20 January , when the airport and incoming roads were reopened . The city of Rockhampton later created a flood plain management policy as a result of the effects from Joy . The floods helped fill the drainage basin of the Peter Faust Dam within a few weeks , speeding up a process which would have otherwise taken several years . Months after the storm , the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service collected reports on environmental impacts from the flooding ; they included some beneficial aspects such as new locations for animal breeding , and alleviation of drought conditions . The Queensland government upgraded a portion of the Bruce Highway near Rockhampton to reduce flooding in similar storms . 
 Officials declared about a third of the state of Queensland as a disaster area following Cyclone Joy , directing state funds toward recovery efforts . The Queensland government provided monetary assistance to eligible families in the disaster zone and offered special loans to farmers affected by the storm . The federal government agreed to contribute 75 % of overall relief costs . Following the cyclone 's impacts in Australia , the name Joy was later retired by the World Meteorological Organization .

 The Qal 'at al @-@ Bahrain ( in Arabic : قلعة البحرين ) , also known as the Bahrain Fort or Fort of Bahrain and previously as the Portugal Fort ( Qal 'at al Portugal ) is an archaeological site located in Bahrain , on the Arabian Peninsula . Archaeological excavations carried out since 1954 have unearthed antiquities from an artificial mound of 12 m ( 39 ft ) height containing seven stratified layers , created by various occupants from 2300 BC up to the 18th century , including Kassites , Portuguese and Persians . It was once the capital of the Dilmun civilization and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005 . 
 = = History and explorations = = 
 The archaeological findings , which are unearthed in the fort , reveal much about the history of the country . The area is thought to have been occupied for about 5000 years and contains a valuable insight into the Copper and Bronze Ages of Bahrain . The first Bahrain Fort was built around three thousand years ago , on the northeastern peak of Bahrain Island . The present fort dates from the sixth century AD . The capital of the Dilmun civilization , Dilmun was , according to the Epic of Gilgamesh , the " land of immortality " , the ancestral place of Sumerians and a meeting point of gods . 
 The site has been termed as Bahrain 's " most important site in antiquity " . The first excavation at the site was carried out by a Danish expedition led by Geoffrey Bibby between 1954 and 1972 , and later by a French expedition from 1977 . Since 1987 Bahrain archaeologists have been involved with this work . The archaeological findings have revealed seven civilizations of urban structures beginning with Dilmun empire , the most important ancient civilization of the region . The Danish expedition revealed that it was a notable Hellenistic site . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The fort and the tell Qal 'at al @-@ Bahrain is built on , are located on the Bahrain island , on the northern seashore . On a clear day it is also seen from Saar . It stands like a " sentinel " near Manama , the capital of Bahrain ; it is 6 km ( 4 mi ) away from Manama on the fertile north coast . The tel is the largest in the Gulf region and was built close to the port and by reclamation of seashore land . 
 = = Description = = 
 <unk> al @-@ Bahrain is a typical tell – an artificial mound created by many successive layers of human occupation . The strata spreads over a 180 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 16 @,@ 723 m2 ) area , which encompasses the tell . This testifies to a continuous human presence from about 2300 BC to the 16th century AD . About 25 % of the site has been excavated revealing structures of different types : residential , public , commercial , religious and military . They testify to the importance of the site as a trading port over the centuries . On the top of the 12 @-@ metre @-@ high ( 39 ft ) mound , there is the impressive <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( Portuguese fort ) , which gave the whole site its name , <unk> , meaning " fort " . As the site was the capital of the Dilmun civilisation , it contains the richest remains of this civilization , which was hitherto only known from written Sumerian references . 
 The site contains many areas and walls , including Saar necropolis , Al @-@ Hajjar necropolis , Kassite Palace , <unk> <unk> necropolis , <unk> Isa necropolis , Al @-@ <unk> Necropolis , Palace of <unk> , <unk> necropolis , and the Northern city wall . The ruins of the Copper Age consists of two sections of the fortification wall surrounding streets and houses , and a colossal building on the edge of the moat of the Portuguese fort in the centre . Barbar pottery has been unearthed around the walls of the central building , dating back to the same age as the Barbar Temples , although some of the other pottery and range of unearthed artefacts indicated that they predated the temples , dating back to 3000 BC or later . Relics of copper and ivory provide an insight into ancient trade links . Many vessels have been unearthed on the site , and Danish excavations of the Palace of <unk> area revealed " snake bowls " , sarcophagi , seals and a mirror , among other things . 
 = = Layout = = 
 The excavations of the tel has revealed a small settlement , the only one of that period in eastern Arabia , on its northern side . It has been inferred that the village was settled by people who developed agriculture near the oasis , planted palm trees , tended cattle , sheep and goats and also ventured into fishing in the Arabian Sea . The small houses they built were made of rough stone with clay or mortar as binding material . The plastered floors in the houses were said to have been spacious . Excavations also hinted that the village had streets which separated the housing complexes . 
 The fortifications seen in the excavated tel area were found around the township and were erected in cardinal directions . The fort walls are seen now only in the northern , western and southern slopes of the tel , and the eastern side is yet to be excavated . The fortifications covered an area of 15 ha ( 37 acres ) , and the walls were built with varying thickness by using stone masonry , and had gates which allowed transport and passing through , such as of donkey caravans . The fortifications were frequently raised , as noted from the gates erected at four levels ; the latest gate had two polished stone ( made of fine grained material ) pivots which fixed a double leafed gate . The western wall was seen well @-@ preserved for a length of 9 m ( 30 ft ) . The streets were laid in north – south direction and were 12 m ( 39 ft ) wide . 
 There was a palace in the centre of the tel at a commanding location consisting of several warehouses which were inferred as indicative of economic activity during the Dilmun period . Proceeding from here towards the north , along the street leads , to a large gate that probably was the entry to the palace grounds . The modest houses built in the same size and type of construction were laid along a network of roads . 
 The place prospered till 1800 BC after when it was deserted . Eventually the town became covered with drift sand from the sea . 
 = = Antiquaries = = 
 Metal artifacts found in the tel were limited to copper pieces , fishing tools and a socketed spearhead ; a workshop of 525 m ( 1 @,@ 722 ft ) size was also identified where copper casting two piece moulds and wax moulds were found . Small and large crucibles used for melting of metal were recovered in substantial quantities indicative of large scale manufacture by professional artisans . The copper ware was then traded in surrounding countries such as Oman and Mesopotamia . Dilmun stamp seals were also recovered from the excavations . 
 Pots and vessels were also recovered . Pots were used for cooking , while the large vessels for food import from Oman and Mesopotamia . Artifacts found there indicates the location . These include a cuneiform inscription and hematite , both of which link to Mesopotamia ; <unk> bowls to Oman ; and carnelian beads , a stone weight and a few potsherds to the Indus Civilization . 
 = Typhoon Ellen ( 1983 ) = 
 Typhoon Ellen was considered the worst typhoon to hit China since 1979 . Typhoon Ellen was first noted as a tropical disturbance east of the International Dateline on August 26 , 1983 , and became a tropical storm soon after crossing the dateline on the morning of August 29 . Initially , strong wind shear inhibited development over the next five days , and the cyclone began to track south of west . On September 2 , conditions aloft finally improved and the cyclone strengthened into a typhoon on September 4 as it tracked west @-@ northwest . Approaching Luzon late on September 5 , Ellen intensified rapidly into a strong typhoon with winds of 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) before interaction with Luzon began to weaken the cyclone . Its final landfall was at Macau on the morning of September 9 as a minimal typhoon . 
 Despite passing north of the Philippines , the storm killed three and left 15 persons injured . Damage in the country totaled $ 680 @,@ 000 ( 1983 USD ) . While passing near Hong Kong , 50 @,@ 000 people lost electrical services . Around 200 homes were destroyed . A total 2 @,@ 000 people were left homeless , 1 @,@ 600 of which sought shelter . Throughout the city , eight people perished and 339 were hurt , including 120 seriously . Ellen spawned the second tornado ever recorded in Hong Kong , and the first ever recorded during a typhoon . Elsewhere , in Macao , little damage was reported . Offshore , 40 crew members had to be rescued in a shipwreck . In a separate incident , eight people were lost at sea . Furthermore , ten Taiwan fishing boats capsized in the South China Sea , resulting in 48 fishermen missing , though 103 persons also survived . Overall , damage totaled $ 79 million and 23 people died .

 Typhoon Ellen originated from a tropical disturbance located 500 km ( 310 mi ) south @-@ southwest of the Johnston Atoll on August 26 . Based on the development of rainbands , satellite intensity estimates indicated winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . The disturbance crossed the dateline two days later and a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) was subsequently issued . At 0000 UTC on August 29 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) first classified the system . Initially , the storm did not develop significantly due to strong wind shear caused by an intense high pressure area north of the cyclone . This also caused Ellen to turn west @-@ southwest . On August 31 , however , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) started warning on the system , declaring it a tropical storm . The next day , the JTWC briefly downgraded the system into a tropical depression ; however , the JMA held the storm 's intensity to 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) for several days . On September 2 , however , the storm began to turn west @-@ northwest and environmental conditions became much more favorable for development , and the JMA upgraded Ellen into a severe tropical storm early the following morning . Later on September 3 , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PASAGA ) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Herming . At 1200 UTC , the JTWC upgraded Ellen into a typhoon , though the JMA did not follow suit until early on September 4 . 
 After maintaining this intensity for 12 hours , Ellen deepened slightly that evening , though the JTWC suggests that the storm intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the United States Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale . By midday on September 5 , data from both agencies indicated that Ellen developed winds 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) while located 370 km ( 230 mi ) west of Luzon . Thereafter , Ellen began to rapidly intensify and according to the JTWC , the pressure decreased by 28 mbar ( 0 @.@ 83 inHg ) . At 0600 UTC on September 6 , Ellen reached peak intensity , with the JMA estimating winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) and a pressure of 925 mbar ( 27 @.@ 3 inHg ) . Meanwhile , the JTWC suggests that Ellen reached a peak intensity of 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) and a slightly higher pressure of 928 mbar ( 27 @.@ 4 inHg ) . 
 However , its peak intensity was short @-@ lived ; Typhoon Ellen soon began to weaken steadily as it moved through the Luzon Straits while interacting with Luzon . After turning northwest , the JMA reported the winds had reduced to 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) at 0000 UTC on September 7 . At that time , the JTWC noted that Ellen 's winds were equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane . However , the JMA suggests that the weakening trend leveled off late on September 7 . The next day , PASAGA ceased monitoring the system as it was no longer a threat to the Philippines . According to the JMA , the system moved ashore near Macao at 0000 UTC on September 9 as an 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) typhoon , though the JTWC estimates that the storm was a little weaker at landfall . Ellen dissipated rapidly overland , and the JTWC downgraded Elen into a tropical depression 12 hours later . However , the JMA kept watching the system until 0600 UTC on September 10 .

 Due to the storm 's threat to Hong Kong , a " no 10 @.@ hurricane signal " was issued . Across Hong Kong , schools and government offices were ordered to be closed and 250 shelters were opened . In addition , most shops and restaurants as well as all financial markets were closed . 
 Despite passing north of the Philippines , the storm killed three and left 15 persons injured . Damage in the country totaled $ 680 @,@ 000 . A total of 605 dwellings were damaged , excluding 105 that were destroyed . Upon making landfall in present @-@ day China , winds gusted to 154 mph ( 248 km / h ) at Stanley .

 = Druk Air = 
 Drukair Corporation Limited ( Dzongkha : <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ། , Wylie : ' <unk> mkha ' ' <unk> las ' <unk> ) , operating as Drukair — Royal Bhutan Airlines , is the national airline of the Kingdom of Bhutan , headquartered in the western dzongkhag of Paro . 
 Founded in 1981 , ten years after Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuck gradually began to open up the kingdom from self @-@ imposed isolation , and seven years after welcoming its first foreign visitors , the airline commenced operations in 1983 with flights from Calcutta to Paro utilising Dornier Do 228 aircraft . A switch to BAe 146 @-@ 100 equipment occurred in November 1988 , and in order to meet increased demand , those aircraft were replaced in 2004 with two Airbus <unk> . 
 Drukair operates a modest scheduled flight network within the South Asian region from its base at Paro Airport and currently consists of ten destinations in five countries . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1968 , the Indian Border Roads Organisation built an airstrip in the Paro valley , which was initially utilised for on call helicopter operations by the Indian Armed Forces for the Royal Government of Bhutan . After consideration by King Jigme Singye Wangchuck and the <unk> , Drukair was established by Royal Charter on 5 April 1981 , ten years after the Druk Gyalpo , King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck gradually began to open up the Kingdom from self @-@ imposed isolation , and seven years after welcoming its first foreign visitors . 
 Paro Airport is located deep in a valley 2 @,@ 235 metres ( 7 @,@ 333 ft ) above sea level , and is surrounded by mountains as high as 4 @,@ 900 metres ( 16 @,@ 100 ft ) . At the time , the runway was 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) in length , giving the Bhutanese government specific requirements for a choice of aircraft to be operated . They required an 18 – 20 seat STOL @-@ capable aircraft with operating capabilities which included a high service ceiling , high rate of climb and high manoeuvrability . The major requirement for the aircraft was that it must be capable of flying Kolkata – Paro – Kolkata , a 1 @,@ 200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) round @-@ trip flight , without refuelling , due to minimal infrastructure being available at Paro for this purpose . Three different aircraft types were considered after flight tests in India and Bhutan between 1978 and 1980 ; however , none was deemed suitable . 
 In mid @-@ 1981 , the Indian government set up a committee to study its own requirements for a light transport aircraft . Based upon this competition , the Bhutanese government ordered one Dornier 228 @-@ 200 for delivery in January 1983 , with the option for a second aircraft for delivery in late 1983 . The first 18 @-@ seat Dornier 228 @-@ 200 landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983 , the exact time of landing , the number of passengers on board and even the direction the aircraft was parked on the airport apron being predetermined by the high lama of Paro Dzong . 
 The airline inaugurated scheduled revenue flights on 11 February 1983 , with Flight 101 departing Paro for Kolkata and returning the next day as Flight 102 . For the first four weeks the flight was operated three times a week , after which it was increased to a daily flight . At the time of service commencement , Paro Airport consisted of the runway , a two @-@ room air traffic control building ( with the ground floor acting as the check @-@ in counter ) and a departure lounge on the lawn . Prior to the establishment of the Department of Civil Aviation in January 1986 , the airline was responsible for the operation and maintenance of airport infrastructure . The airline commenced flights to Dhaka in Bangladesh on 30 October 1986 . 
 = = = Jet era = = = 
 On 30 December 1987 , a US $ 25 million order was placed with British Aerospace for a BAe 146 @-@ 100 STOL regional jet . The purchase of the aircraft was financed by the government , obtaining , for the first time in the country 's history , a commercial loan . In 1988 , the airlines ' operational base was shifted from Kolkata to Paro Airport and the airline also hired its first seven flight attendants who were trained by Thai Airways International . On 21 November 1988 , the BAe 146 was delivered to Paro Airport . With the introduction of the BAe 146 , Drukair was able to widen its network to link Paro with Delhi on 26 November 1988 , Bangkok on 28 January 1989 and Kathmandu in April 1989 . In the first full year of operational service with the BAe 146 , the airline achieved an average load factor of 50 – 60 percent , more than the 40 percent which was expected , carrying 12 @,@ 732 passengers over the 1989 – 1990 period . In 1990 , the runway at Paro Airport was lengthened from 1 @,@ 400 metres ( 4 @,@ 600 ft ) to 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) and reinforced for heavier aircraft . A hangar was also constructed for the aircraft , which was funded by the Indian government as part of the Paro Airport Development Project . 
 The airlines ' only aircraft was requisitioned by King Jigme Singye on 9 November 1990 , in order to allow the king and his party to travel to Tokyo for the coronation of Akihito as Emperor of Japan . From Japan , the King then travelled to <unk> in the Maldives for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit between 21 – 23 November , and returned to Bhutan in order for the aircraft to re @-@ enter service with the airline on 25 November . Due to a requirement stipulated by the Bhutanese government that all foreign tourists , with the exception of Indian nationals , enter and leave Bhutan by air , the country 's tourism industry was brought to a halt , which saw the airline paying hefty penalties to disgruntled tour operators . This problem was somewhat alleviated when a second BAe 146 entered service in 1992 , and on 11 November 1993 , the airline introduced a 10 Executive Class on the aircraft . On 13 May 1991 , Drukair was registered under the Companies Act of Bhutan . Service to Yangon , the capital of Myanmar , began on 6 January 1997 . 
 During 2000 – 2001 , Drukair could operate with only one single aircraft for over a year due to a corrosion defect in its A5 @-@ <unk> aircraft in the wing tanks that was detected during a check at Woodford . The wings were replaced . In 2002 , an <unk> was wet @-@ leased from <unk> to cover for maintenance to A5 @-@ <unk> . 
 Drukair became the launch customer for the Avro RJX @-@ 85 in April 2000 when it placed an order with BAE Systems for two aircraft , with deliveries initially scheduled to take place in November 2001 and January 2002 . Delays in the first flight and certification of the RJX pushed back expected delivery to Drukair to after April 2002 . BAe Systems cancelled the RJX program in November 2002 , due to receiving orders from only two airlines , Drukair and British European . With British European threatening legal action to enforce their contract with BAE Systems , the aircraft manufacturer offered to fulfil the contract for Drukair , although airline management decided against acquiring the aircraft , citing potential problems with sourcing spare parts for the aircraft in future . 
 In order to find a replacement for the 2 BAe <unk> , Drukair management fielded submissions from Airbus , Boeing and Embraer to determine their products ' suitability to meet Drukair 's stringent operational requirements . Bombardier was also invited by management to demonstrate the <unk> regional jet , however , the airline was advised by Bombardier the aircraft would be unsuited for operations at Paro . In February 2002 , the Airbus A319 became the largest aircraft to ever land at Paro Airport , when Airbus demonstrated the aircraft to the airline . By October , Boeing had withdrawn from the competition due to not being able to source an aircraft to demonstrate to the airline . With the Embraer E @-@ 190 yet to fly , it was expected that Drukair would order the A319 . However , the government had concerns regarding financing for the purchase , and in October the final decision was delayed . After a short period of time , the government instructed management to begin evaluations once again , and a Boeing 737 – 700 conducted eleven test flights at Paro Airport in February 2003 , in which it was demonstrated it met the requirements of the airline for operation into Paro . 
 Airbus signed a memorandum of understanding with Drukair in July 2003 for two 114 @-@ seat Airbus A319 @-@ 115 , powered by two CFM56 @-@ 5B engines , for delivery in the second half of 2004 . The purchase of the two jets , valued at 3 @,@ 534 @.@ 36 million Bhutanese <unk> ( BTN ) , was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan , and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004 – 2005 . The Bhutanese government issued BTN 1 @,@ 767 @.@ 18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for only the second time in Bhutan 's history intended to seek a commercial loan for the other aircraft . However , in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a soft loan for this purpose . 
 On 11 November 2003 , the king 's birthday , Drukair initiated services to Gaya , India . Bodh Gaya , 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) from Gaya , is the site of the <unk> Temple where <unk> Gautama , the Buddha , reached enlightenment , and 30 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 Bhutanese make the pilgrimage every year . Pilgrims have previously made the pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya via a 2 – 3 @-@ day overland trip from the Bhutanese border town of <unk> , and Drukair management plans on acquiring 20 – 30 % of this traffic , although the airline had yet to record a profit on the route at of February 2006 . The following month , as a result of Royal Bhutan Army efforts to expel from Bhutan territory Indian separatist insurgent groups , notably the United Liberation Front of <unk> and the National Democratic Front of <unk> , flights to Dhaka were suspended from 29 December in order to prevent insurgents from using Drukair flights to escape to alleged hideouts in Bangladesh .

 The first Airbus A319 arrived in Bhutan on 19 October 2004 ; the date chosen after a Buddhist astrologer was consulted to ensure the aircraft arrived in Bhutan on an auspicious day in the Buddhist calendar . Before entering service on commercial flights on 31 October 2004 , Drukair took their A319 on a country @-@ wide flight in honour of the <unk> of Crown Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck to the <unk> <unk> . The second aircraft was delivered by Airbus to Drukair in December 2004 . On 31 August 2012 , Druk Air took delivery of a third Airbus A319 . 
 In July 2005 , the governments of India and Bhutan signed a new bilateral air services agreement which increased the allowable number of weekly flights between the two countries from 12 to 49 . In addition to destinations already served by Drukair , the cities of Mumbai , Chennai and Guwahati were included in their services agreement , with Bhutan being granted fifth freedom rights from several Indian cities to onward destinations such as Yangon , Dhaka and Singapore . 
 Domestic helicopter service was inaugurated in November 2005 , in line with a resolution by the Council of Ministers in April 2001 which stated that domestic services should be introduced . Thirty heliports across the country were identified , and the introduction of services saw , for example , the 550 kilometres ( 340 mi ) trip from Thimphu to <unk> taking only one hour , instead of two to three days . The Eurocopter <unk> helicopter operated by the Nepalese operator , Air Dynasty , had by January 2006 seen 30 hours of service , netting Drukair US $ 3 @,@ 000 in profits . 
 Flights to Dhaka , suspended since 29 December 2003 , resumed on 23 October 2006 , and the airline was given rights to fly to Chittagong and Cox 's Bazar by the Bangladeshi authorities . The airline announced plans in July 2007 to start scheduled flights to Mumbai via Kathmandu from March 2008 , inline with the strategy of Drukair management to increase the number of Indian tourists travelling to Bhutan during the low season months of June through August and November through February . These plans were put on hold in March 2008 , due to Paro Airport not being able to handle night flights and the airline only being able to secure landing slots at Mumbai 's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at 3 am . Plans for services to Hong Kong , Singapore , Abu Dhabi , Dubai and Sharjah were also shelved . 
 The airline posted its first profit in 2007 of BTN 31 @.@ 15 million . The two BAe 146 aircraft were sold to Star Perú in October 2007 for US $ 3 @.@ 3 million , and left Bhutan for Peru in November and December 2007 . 
 Druk Gyalpo Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck on 11 November 2007 issued a Royal Kasho establishing Druk Holding and Investments Limited , a holding company which would manage existing and future investments of the Royal Bhutanese government . As a result , seven government @-@ owned companies , including Drukair , had their ownership transferred from the Ministry of Finance to the newly formed holding company . Incorporated on 13 November 2007 , Druk Holding and Investments announced in December 2007 that given Bhutan 's tourism industry being reliant on Drukair , the head of the government agency overseeing tourism development in Bhutan would become the chairperson of Drukair , and would be responsible for improving the performance of the national airline . 
 In March 2008 , Drukair introduced a new uniform for its flight attendants , consisting of a contemporary <unk> and <unk> . The uniforms were introduced for the centenary celebrations of the monarchy , as well as the airlines own silver jubilee . The uniform was chosen by way of a competition in which five Bhutanese fashion designers submitted entries , with the winner receiving a BTN 75 @,@ 000 prize . The textiles used in the new uniform were chosen via a competition which was jointly organised by Drukair and the United Nations Development Programme to promote the Bhutanese textile industry and culture . 
 Although the government of Bhutan goes to great lengths to prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture , Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large . In June 2008 , citing hikes in the price of oil and the need to contain operational costs , the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs , whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi , Kolkata and Bangkok airports . Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth @-@ freedom rights , Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines , such as Myanmar Airways International , Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances , whilst at the same time earning extra revenue . 
 The airline was due to begin flights on 20 April 2009 to Bagdogra Airport in India , but had to delay the inaugural flight due to the lack of immigration and customs facilities at the airport . The inaugural flight to Bagdogra Airport left Paro Airport on 18 June 2009 , making Drukair the first international airline to operate into the airport . In Bagdogra , a ceremony was held which was attended by S. M. Krishna , the Indian Minister for External Affairs , and <unk> Ugyen <unk> , the Bhutanese Minister of Foreign Affairs .

 The airline is a lifeline for the Bhutanese people , connecting Bhutan with the outside world and supporting emerging inbound tourism and export markets . Drukair has recently been criticised for its unreliability — particularly by the Bhutanese tourism industry which is still in its infancy and regards the very company upon which it relies as its biggest threat . 
 In October 2009 , the Bhutanese government planned construction works of an airstrip in <unk> . The airstrip , which was expected to be 3 @,@ 900 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) in length and operational by March 2010 , would allow for service by small aircraft in the 15 – 16 seat category . The project was being financed with Nu . 34 million from the budget which was previously allocated to the development of domestic helicopter services . The airstrip would only be operational during the morning hours due to high winds in the afternoon , making safe operations risky . 
 Drukair is conducting a feasibility study into operating flights to the airstrip from Paro , as well as , two others which are under construction at <unk> and Gelephu . 
 In 2006 the Indian government acting for the Bhutanese government , conducted a feasibility study into the viability of an international airport near the southern Bhutanese town of Gelephu . In the five @-@ year plan ( which covers 2008 – 2013 ) the sum of BTN 2 @,@ 826 million had been allocated by the Bhutanese government for development of the new airport . A preliminary survey was conducted by India in May 2006 and the survey team from the Airports Authority of India was to return and complete the final survey in September 2006 . In October 2008 the project was shelved , and the Bhutanese government decided that the airport at Gelephu would be used for domestic flights only . 
 Since then , the construction of a domestic airport at Gelephu has been scheduled to commence in late 2010 with the airport proposing to start operations in June 2011 . The Bhutanese Department of Civil Aviation ( DCA ) has indicated that Gelephu 's will be an ' all @-@ weather ' airport that may be able to accept some international traffic in the future . 
 Under the Vision 2020 Plan , the Royal Bhutanese Government has identified the requirement for improved external air links by 2017 , in an effort to increase tourism revenue 100 % by 2012 and 150 % by 2017 . Drukair is conducting feasibility studies into the commencement of operations to either Hong Kong or Singapore by March 2011 . The airline 's commercial manager has stated that preliminary studies show that Bhutanese traffic to Singapore would consist mainly of official travel , whilst traffic to Hong Kong would be mainly commercial , with good prospects for tourism development . 
 On 21 April 2010 , an ATR 42 turboprop regional aircraft was delivered to Paro under a nine @-@ month lease . The aircraft was used on flights from Paro to Kolkata and Kathmandu , and was on standby during the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in Thimphu at the end of April . Drukair announced its intention to join the International Air Transport Association in 2009 .

 The ATR 42 first operated on a nine @-@ month lease from April 2010 was evaluated by the airline with the possibility of a future purchase . On 4 June 2011 , a purchased ATR 42 arrived in Paro . Drukair had bought the 48 @-@ seater with the view of using it to service the domestic routes to Bumthang and <unk> in late 2011 . 
 = HMS Vindex ( 1915 ) = 
 HMS Vindex was a Royal Navy seaplane carrier during the First World War . The ship spent the bulk of her career operating the North Sea , where she twice unsuccessfully attacked the German Zeppelin base at Tondern and conducted anti @-@ Zeppelin patrols . One of her Bristol Scout aircraft made the first take @-@ off from an aircraft carrier in late 1915 . Another made the first interception of an airship by a carrier @-@ based aircraft in mid @-@ 1916 , when it unsuccessfully attacked the Zeppelin <unk> . Vindex was transferred to the Mediterranean in 1918 and was sold back to her original owners in 1920 . She was requisitioned again in 1939 and served through World War II as a troopship under a different name . After the end of the war , the ship was returned to her owners and was sold for scrapping in 1954 . 
 = = Description and conversion = = 
 The ship had an overall length of 361 feet 6 inches ( 110 @.@ 2 m ) , a beam of 42 feet ( 12 @.@ 8 m ) , and a draught of 13 feet 8 inches ( 4 @.@ 2 m ) at deep load . She displaced 2 @,@ 950 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) . Her three direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each driving a propeller shaft , produced a total of 11 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 8 @,@ 200 kW ) . Steam was provided by four boilers . The ship carried 475 long tons ( 483 t ) of coal which meant that she could steam for 995 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 843 km ; 1 @,@ 145 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Her crew numbered 218 , including 76 aviation personnel . 
 Vindex 's main armament consisted of four 50 @-@ calibre , 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) 12 @-@ pounder 18 cwt guns , with 130 rounds stored for each gun . They fired 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 790 m / s ) ; this gave a maximum range of 9 @,@ 300 yd ( 8 @,@ 500 m ) . Their rate of fire was 15 rounds per minute . The ship also carried a single QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss anti @-@ aircraft gun for which she carried 55 rounds . This had a maximum depression of 8 ° and a maximum elevation of 60 ° . It fired a 6 @-@ pound ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 765 ft / s ( 538 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute . It had a maximum ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , but an effective range of only 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) . The 12 @-@ pounder guns were later replaced by two 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft guns . 
 Vindex was fitted with a 64 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 19 @.@ 5 m ) flying @-@ off deck forward , intended for aircraft with wheeled undercarriages , and a prominent hangar aft . Two electric cranes were fitted aft and two derricks forward to handle her aircraft . Initially she carried two dismantled single @-@ seat aircraft in her small forward hangar and five floatplanes in the hangar aft . Both aircraft in the forward hangar could be reassembled and flown off in about ten minutes . She was capable of operating up to seven aircraft , and during her career , operated a range of aircraft including the Sopwith Schneider , the Sopwith Pup and the Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter in addition to the aircraft mentioned . 
 = = Service = = 
 The ship was built in 1905 by Armstrong Whitworth , Newcastle upon Tyne as the Viking , a fast passenger ferry for the Isle of Man Steam Packet . Viking was requisitioned by the Royal Navy on 26 March 1915 for conversion to a seaplane carrier , and was purchased outright on 11 November 1915 . She was renamed HMS Vindex to avoid confusion with the destroyer HMS Viking . 
 Vindex was assigned to the Harwich Force in November 1915 and operated in the North Sea through 1917 . A Bristol Scout C made the first take @-@ off from the ship on 3 November 1915 with the ship steaming at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) ; the aircraft only used 46 feet ( 14 @.@ 0 m ) of the flight deck and it was the first take @-@ off by a landplane from a Royal Navy ship . On 25 March 1916 Vindex attempted to attack the Zeppelin base at Tondern with three Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes , but the attack was ineffective . It did , however , draw out elements of the German Navy so it was repeated on 4 May with the addition of HMS Engadine . The two ships carried eleven Babies between them , each armed with 65 @-@ pound ( 29 @.@ 5 kg ) bombs , but eight failed to take @-@ off ; one hit the mast of an escorting destroyer and one had to return due to engine trouble . No damage was inflicted , but one Zeppelin was shot down by a cruiser when it sortied to find the British ships . On 2 August one of her Bristol Scouts unsuccessfully attacked the Zeppelin <unk> with explosive Ranken darts , the first interception of an airship by a carrier @-@ based aircraft in history . Vindex was to provide aerial reconnaissance with two of her seaplanes for a Coastal Motor Boat raid on 22 October 1916 , but the operation was aborted because of fog . 
 The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet at Malta in 1918 , where she served until she was paid off in late 1919 . Vindex was originally intended to be retained for service with the fleet after the end of the war , but this proved to be too expensive and she was sold back to her original owners on 12 February 1920 and reverted to her original name . She was requisitioned again in 1939 and served through the Second World War as a troopship , but not as HMS Vindex . The ship was returned to her owners in 1945 and was finally sold for scrap in 1954 . 
 = Delaware Route 14 = 
 Delaware Route 14 ( DE 14 ) is a state highway in the southern part of Kent County , Delaware . The route runs from the Maryland border near Burrsville , Maryland , where it continues as Maryland Route 317 ( MD 317 ) , east to DE 1 in Milford . The route passes through Harrington , where it intersects U.S. Route 13 ( US 13 ) , and passes to the north of Houston before coming to Milford , where it intersects DE 15 , US 113 , and DE 1 Business ( DE 1 Bus . ) . DE 14 has a truck bypass of Harrington known as DE 14 Truck . 
 DE 14 was first designated by 1936 to run from the Maryland border near Burrsville east to DE 26 in Bethany Beach . In 1939 , the road was extended south to Fenwick Island . In the 1940s , the road was realigned to bypass Rehoboth Beach . The route between Nassau and Rehoboth Beach was widened into a divided highway in the 1950s , with all of DE 14 southeast of Milford being upgraded to a divided highway by the 1970s . In 1977 , most of DE 14 east of Milford was replaced with DE 1 , with the eastern terminus being realigned to its current location by 1984 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 DE 14 begins at the Maryland border , where it continues west into that state as MD 317 . From the state line , the route heads east on two @-@ lane undivided Vernon Road , passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with occasional homes . The road curves to the northeast before bending east as Walt Messick Road and entering Harrington . DE 14 runs past homes and some businesses before intersecting DE 14 Truck , which bypasses Harrington to the south . At this point , DE 14 heads northeast on Commerce Street into the downtown area . Here , the route turns east onto Clark Street and crosses Norfolk Southern 's Delmarva Secondary railroad line . On the eastern edge of Harrington , DE 14 intersects US 13 in a commercial area , at which point DE 14 Truck returns to the route . 
 Past this intersection , the route leaves Harrington and becomes Milford Harrington Highway , heading through a mix of farms and woods with some residential development . The road continues east through more rural areas , passing to the north of Houston . Farther east , DE 14 bends southeast and intersects the southern terminus of DE 15 , crossing into Milford . The road enters commercial areas and gains a center left @-@ turn lane , coming to an intersection with US 113 . Past this intersection , the route becomes Northwest Front Street and runs past homes and businesses a short distance to the north of Norfolk Southern 's Indian River Secondary railroad line and Silver Lake along the Mispillion River , narrowing back to two lanes . The road curves to the east , passing to the south of the Parson Thorne Mansion , and heads through the downtown of Milford , becoming Northeast Front Street at the intersection with North Walnut Street . DE 14 passes a short distance to the north of the Mispillion River , curving northeast and coming to an intersection with DE 1 Bus . Past this intersection , the route continues through areas of farmland with some commercial development , ending at an intersection with the DE 1 bypass of Milford . 
 DE 14 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 14 @,@ 121 vehicles at the western edge of Milford to a low of 1 @,@ 804 vehicles at the eastern terminus at DE 1 . None of DE 14 is part of the National Highway System . 
 = = History = = 
 What would become DE 14 originally existed as a county road between the Maryland border in Burrsville and Rehoboth Beach by 1920 . By 1924 , the road was built as a state highway between Burrsville and Milford and was proposed as one between Nassau and Rehoboth Beach . A year later , the state road was completed between Milford and Cedar Creek and from Nassau to just west of Rehoboth Beach , with the sections between Cedar Creek and Nassau and into Rehoboth Beach under proposal . A bascule bridge was constructed over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal in Rehoboth Beach in 1926 . In 1927 , the state highway between Milford and Rehoboth Beach was finished with the construction of a bascule bridge over the Broadkill River . 
 In 1931 , a state gravel road was extended from Bethany Beach to the Indian River Inlet along the Atlantic Ocean , providing access to the inlet for recreational purposes . By this time , the county road between Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach was paved . In January 1933 , bids were made for construction of a gravel road from Dewey Beach south to the Indian River Inlet as well as for a timber bridge across the inlet , connecting with the gravel road between the Indian River Inlet and Bethany Beach . This gravel road would provide a direct connection between Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach and would provide better access to the Atlantic coast for recreation . The Ocean Highway between Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach was completed in 1933 . In fall of that year , the roadway between Bethany Beach and Indian River Inlet was paved , with recommendations to pave the road north from the Indian River Inlet toward Rehoboth Beach . In 1934 , the Ocean Highway between the Indian River Inlet and Rehoboth Beach was paved . The same year , recommendations were made to extend the Ocean Highway south from Bethany Beach to Fenwick Island , where it would lead to a Maryland state highway continuing to Ocean City . 
 DE 14 was designated to run from the Maryland border in Burrsville east to DE 26 in Bethany Beach by 1936 . In 1939 , a southern extension of DE 14 was built between Bethany Beach and the Maryland border in Fenwick Island as a gravel road . In 1940 , a swing bridge opened across the Indian River Inlet . The same year , work began for a bypass of the route between Dewey Beach and west of Rehoboth Beach , which included a bascule bridge over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal . In 1942 , the Rehoboth Beach bypass for DE 14 was completed . In addition , the roadway was paved between Fenwick Island and Bethany Beach by that year . In 1952 , a new swing bridge opened across the Indian River Inlet after the previous bridge was destroyed by ice and tides in 1948 . 
 The route was widened into a divided highway between DE 18 ( now US 9 ) in Nassau and Rehoboth Beach in 1954 in order to provide relief to traffic heading to the beaches . Channelized intersections were built at DE 18 and the entrance to Rehoboth Beach . As part of this widening , DE 14 was moved to a new alignment to bypass <unk> Corner , removing a concurrency with DE 18 ( now US 9 Bus . ) . In 1956 , DE 14 was realigned slightly north to its current alignment in Burrsville to meet a new routing of MD 317 ; the former alignment is now Knife Box Road . In 1965 , a new dual bridge was constructed across the Indian River Inlet . By 1966 , DE 14A was designated onto the former alignment of DE 14 through Rehoboth Beach . The divided highway portion of DE 14 was extended north to DE 16 , which included a bypass of Nassau , and between the Indian River Inlet and South Bethany in 1967 . In 1971 , the divided <unk> Bypass between DE 14 southeast of Milford and US 113 north of Milford was completed . In 1971 , a contract was awarded to widen DE 14 to a divided highway between Fenwick Island and South Bethany . This widening project was completed a year later . In 1973 , construction was underway to make DE 14 a divided highway from the Milford Bypass to DE 16 , which included a bypass of Argos Corner ; this was completed in 1974 . 
 In 1974 , DE 1 was signed concurrent with DE 14 east of Milford and on the Milford Bypass . In 1977 , DE 14 was truncated to the southern terminus of the Milford Bypass southeast of Milford , with DE 1 replacing the route between Fenwick Island and the south end of the Milford Bypass and DE 1 Bus. becoming concurrent with route between the Milford Bypass and Northeast Front Street . As a result of this , DE 14A was renumbered to DE 1A . DE 14 was realigned to follow Northeast Front Street to end at DE 1 on the Milford Bypass by 1984 .

 Delaware Route 14 Truck ( DE 14 Truck ) is a truck bypass of DE 14 in Harrington . The route heads south from DE 14 on two @-@ lane undivided Farmington Road , leaving Harrington and heading through farmland . DE 14 Truck turns east onto Tower Hill Road and crosses Norfolk Southern 's Delmarva Secondary railroad line before coming to an intersection with US 13 . At this point , the truck route turns north to form a concurrency with US 13 on Dupont Highway , a four @-@ lane divided highway . The road heads back into Harrington and runs through commercial areas , passing to the east of the Delaware State Fairgrounds , which is where the Delaware State Fair is held and the Harrington Raceway & Casino is located . US 13 / DE 14 Truck crosses Norfolk Southern 's Indian River Secondary , with the median widening to include businesses in it . DE 14 Truck ends at another intersection with DE 14 . DE 14 Truck was designated in 2008 following an $ 8 @.@ 5 million , year @-@ long project that improved the roads the truck route follows .

 = Hurricane Kiko ( 1989 ) = 
 Hurricane Kiko was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to have hit the eastern coast of Mexico 's Baja California peninsula during recorded history . The eleventh named storm of the 1989 Pacific hurricane season , Kiko formed out of a large mesoscale convective system on August 25 . Slowly tracking northwestward , the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane early the next day . Strengthening continued until early August 27 , when Kiko reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . The storm turned west at this time , and at around 0600 UTC , the storm made landfall near Punta Arena at the southern tip of Baja California Sur . The hurricane rapidly weakened into a tropical storm later that day and further into a tropical depression by August 28 , shortly after entering the Pacific Ocean . The depression persisted for another day while tracking southward , before being absorbed by nearby Tropical Storm Lorena . Though Kiko made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane , its impact was relatively minor . Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed and numerous highways were flooded by torrential rains . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Unlike most other eastern Pacific hurricanes between 1988 and 1990 that began as tropical waves off the western coast of Africa , Hurricane Kiko developed out of a large @-@ scale mesoscale convective system on August 23 on the coast of Sonora . The system slowly tracked southward into the Gulf of California and became increasingly organized . Shower and thunderstorm activity was present around an area of low pressure the following day ; however , insufficient reports from the region hindered the National Hurricane Center 's ( NHC ) forecasting ability . By August 25 , satellite intensity estimates , using the Dvorak technique , indicated that the low had developed into a tropical depression around 1200 UTC , while the storm was located about 115 miles ( 185 kilometers ) south of Mazatlán , Sinaloa . Operationally , the system was not declared a tropical depression ; instead it was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kiko with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . Located within an area with little or no steering current , and situated over warm waters and underneath an upper @-@ level low , conditions were near perfect for rapid intensification , despite the proximity to land . A general northwestward drift was anticipated , and the NHC forecast the storm to reach hurricane intensity within 24 hours . 
 Convective banding features began to develop late on August 25 as winds around the center reached 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . With the development of an anticyclone over the storm , Kiko 's outflow become more pronounced . Around 0600 UTC on August 26 , an eye developed within the small circulation , suggesting the cyclone had strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . However , satellite intensity estimates indicated winds of only 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . Shortly after , Kiko was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . Ships in the vicinity of the hurricane reported tropical storm @-@ force winds extending roughly 50 mi ( 85 km ) from the center . Winds within the eyewall subsequently increased to 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) , making Kiko a minimal Category 3 hurricane . Intensification continued for another six hours , ending around 0000 UTC on August 27 , at which time the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 955 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 2 inHg ) . 
 Around the time of peak intensity , Dvorak intensity estimates reached <unk> , equating to a minimal Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) . A trough located to the north of the hurricane began to weaken , causing the storm to track in a more westward direction . Kiko weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Arena , on the southern tip of Baja California , with winds of 115 mph ( 185 mph ) . Kiko was thus the second major hurricane to ever make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Baja California since reliable recordkeeping began in 1949 , with the other being 1967 's Hurricane Olivia . Due to the small size and slow movement of the storm , it rapidly weakened , becoming a tropical storm by 1800 UTC . Convection associated with the storm significantly diminished ; the center of circulation became nearly devoid of thunderstorm activity early on August 28 . Shortly after emerging into the Pacific Ocean , Kiko was further downgraded into a tropical depression , and turned towards the southwest due to interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Lorena . Tropical Depression Kiko dissipated around 1800 UTC on August 29 ; however , its remnants continued southward before being absorbed by Lorena .

 Around 2100 UTC on August 25 , the Government of Mexico issued a hurricane warning for the Islas Marías and areas between the southern border of Sonora and El Dorado . A hurricane watch was also issued for areas between Los Burros and the southern tip of Baja California Sur along the Gulf of California . By 0900 UTC the following day , the hurricane watch was upgraded to a warning . Roughly three hours later , the previous hurricane watch issued for Sonora was discontinued as Kiko was no longer forecast to make landfall in the state . The hurricane warning on Baja California was also extended northward to Bahía Concepción . Due to uncertainty in Kiko 's track , a hurricane watch was re @-@ issued for Sonora between El Dorado and Los Mochis . Around 0900 UTC on August 27 , a hurricane warning was issued for areas south of San Carlos on the Pacific coast of Baja California . The hurricane watch for Sonora was then discontinued . By 1800 UTC , the hurricane warnings on the Gulf Coast of Baja California were replaced by a tropical storm warning which was declared for areas between the southern tip of the peninsula and Bahía Concepción . At this time , the hurricane warning for the Pacific coast was revised to a tropical storm warning . Early on August 28 , all watches and warnings were discontinued as Kiko weakened into a tropical depression and moved away from land . 
 In Baja California Sur , more than 1 @,@ 300 people evacuated to shelters in La Paz . Flights arriving and departing in the region were canceled or diverted to other airports . The Red Cross prepared shelters in schools , hospitals , and other public buildings throughout the city . On the Islas Marías , an unconfirmed report of 54 mph ( 87 km / h ) sustained winds was relayed to the National Hurricane Center . Due to the hurricane 's small size , only areas directly in the path of the storm received precipitation ; however , a monsoonal outer band on the eastern side of the storm produced widespread rainfall in eastern Mexico . In Sonora , over 7 in ( 180 mm ) of rain fell in mountainous areas , while numerous locations recorded at least 1 in ( 25 mm ) . In Baja California , the heaviest rainfall was recorded in Los Cabos , and amounted to 11 @.@ 97 in ( 304 mm ) . Only a small portion of the peninsula received more than 10 in ( 250 mm ) of rain . At least 1 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from heavily damaged areas . Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed by Hurricane Kiko . High winds , gusting over 109 mph ( 175 km / h ) , brought down numerous trees and power lines . 
 Before Kiko 's eye moved ashore , the airport near Cabo San Lucas reported sustained winds of 47 mph ( 76 km / h ) with gusts up to 63 mph ( 101 km / h ) . Meteorological recordings near the place of landfall were not available as the small system tracked over a sparsely populated region . From La Paz to Cabo San Lucas , power and water supplies were lost . The heavy rains flooded several highways , and the resultant flood waters overturned a bus . Passengers on the bus managed to escape injury and were quickly brought to shelter by the local fire department . The storm 's effects washed out roughly 100 yd ( 91 m ) of the San Antonio – San Bartolome highway . The Rancho <unk> Resort in Buena Vista sustained severe roof damage and several docked boats were damaged . Several days after Kiko dissipated , remnant moisture from the storm contributed to a complex weather system that produced torrential rainfall throughout the U.S. state of Kansas , unofficially reaching 16 in ( 410 mm ) in localized areas .

Rising to high rank under Byzantine emperor Basil I ( reigned 867 – 886 ) , he then rose further to prominence under Basil 's successor Emperor Leo VI the Wise ( r . 886 – 912 ) , who had a close friendship and possibly an affair with Stylianos 's daughter Zoe Zaoutzaina . Stylianos Zaoutzes was Leo 's leading minister during the first half of his reign , and was awarded the unique title of basileopator . His standing and influence declined after 895 , but in 898 , he became Leo 's father @-@ in @-@ law when the Byzantine emperor married Zoe . He died in 899 , in the same year as Zoe . Following an attempted coup by his relatives , the Zaoutzes clan was deprived of the considerable power it had amassed under Stylianos 's tutelage .

 = = = Origins and early career = = = 
 Zaoutzes was of Armenian descent , and was born in the thema of Macedonia . It has been theorized by the historian Nicholas Adontz that Zaoutzes might be the son of a contemporary strategos of Macedonia named <unk> , the name also of Zaoutzes 's son , but the connection is ultimately impossible to prove . According to Steven Runciman , the surname Zaoutzes derives from the Armenian word <unk> , " negro " , reflecting Zaoutzes 's particularly dark complexion . In the same vein , Zaoutzes was known among Byzantines as " the Ethiopian " . Whatever his exact ancestry , he shared ethnic and geographical origin with the Emperor Basil I the Macedonian , a factor that probably played an important role in his ascent to high office during the latter 's reign . 
 In late 882 , the young Leo , Basil 's second son and heir after the death of his elder brother Constantine in 879 , was wedded to Theophano , a member of the <unk> family . The bride was the choice of empress Eudokia Ingerina , and did not please Leo , who instead preferred the company of Zoe Zaoutzaina , the beautiful daughter of Stylianos Zaoutzes . Whether Zoe was actually his mistress is uncertain ; Leo himself strenuously denied this in later accounts . At that point , Zaoutzes held the post of mikros hetaireiarches , i.e. commander of the junior regiment of the Byzantine emperor 's mercenary bodyguard , the hetaireia . Leo 's relations with his father Basil were always strained , and when Theophano informed him of this affair , Basil reportedly became enraged , beat Leo until he bled , and married Zoe off to one Theodore <unk> . Furthermore , in 883 , Leo was denounced as plotting against Basil and was imprisoned ; it was only through the intervention of patriarch Photios and Stylianos Zaoutzes that he was not also blinded . This affair does not seem to have hurt Zaoutzes 's own standing with Basil or his career , for by the end of Basil 's reign he was protospatharios and megas hetaireiarches ( senior commander of the hetaireia ) . 
 = = = Rise to prominence = = = 
 Leo spent three years in prison , until released and restored to his rank in late July 886 . Here too Zaoutzes played a major role , as he personally pleaded with the Byzantine emperor to secure Leo 's release . By that time , Basil was ailing , and on August 12 , 886 , he was gravely wounded during a hunt . Zaoutzes 's participation in the hunt raised suspicions of a conspiracy , but his complicity is generally rejected , as Basil survived for nine days , during which he did not punish Zaoutzes . Upon Basil 's death , Leo was crowned emperor , but Zaoutzes , who was awarded the titles of patrikios and magistros and the office of logothetes tou dromou , effectively assumed control of the government , directing state policy . One tradition , based on the Vita Euthymii ( the hagiography of Patriarch <unk> I ) , holds that Basil himself appointed Zaoutzes as regent ( <unk> ) , but other sources indicate that his ascent to power was more gradual . It is indicative of his authority that most of Leo 's ordinances ( novels ) are directed to him in person , and in 893 , he succeeded in getting his protégé , Antony <unk> , elected as Patriarch of Constantinople . In the same period ( between 886 and 893 ) , Emperor Leo VI himself delivered a homily on a church built on Zaoutzes 's orders in Constantinople . 
 Zaoutzes 's rise to prominence was consolidated in 891 – 893 , when he was given the newly created title of basileopator ( " father of the emperor " ) . His promotion to this new and enigmatic title has been a subject of controversy , as neither the reasons for the creation of the title nor its exact functions are known . The early date of his elevation precludes a relation to the eventual rise of his daughter Zoe to the imperial throne as Leo 's empress . Gratitude for Zaoutzes 's support against Basil may have played a role , and a common theory is that the office implied some form of tutorship over the emperor . The office certainly confirmed Zaoutzes as the senior secular official of the Byzantine Empire . However , although Zaoutzes has traditionally been regarded as an all @-@ powerful regent over a weak emperor , in no small part due to the account provided in the Vita Euthymii , the actual relationship between the two may have been quite different . A more careful evaluation of the source material has led modern scholarship to conclude that Leo was actively involved in government , and that Zaoutzes as chief minister was loyal and obsequious to his master . 
 An assessment of his record as the Byzantine Empire 's first minister is difficult . Of the few available sources on his career , the Vita Euthymii , compiled years after Zaoutzes 's death , is extremely hostile , seeking to pin the responsibility for several of the reign 's failures or unpopular decisions on him , and thus preserve Leo from blame . The account of the Vita is further colored by the fierce rivalry between Zaoutzes and <unk> , then a <unk> and Leo 's spiritual father , over influence on the Byzantine emperor . Thus the Vita accuses Zaoutzes of being responsible for the sacking of the successful general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder from the army , as well as for the outbreak of hostilities with Bulgaria in 893 : allegedly , two of his protégés moved the main market for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessalonica and then proceeded to extract exorbitant fees from the Bulgarian merchants . When Leo , at the behest of Zaoutzes , rejected the merchants ' protests , the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I found a pretext to attack Byzantium . It has , however , been recently suggested by the scholar Paul Magdalino that the transfer was in fact Leo 's initiative , aiming to enrich Thessalonica , whose patron saint , Saint Demetrius , he showed special favor to . 
 = = = Fall from favor and death = = = 
 Nevertheless , all this has led to the enduring image of an ineffectual leadership in foreign and military affairs under Zaoutzes . This may explain why , despite the resumption of Leo 's affair with Zoe , the relationship between Zaoutzes and the emperor became strained : tales of an alleged plot by Zaoutzes 's son to murder Leo in 894 / 895 indicate a rift between the two , and although Zaoutzes himself was not involved , a major quarrel between them ensued shortly after . Although they were reconciled , Zaoutzes 's standing seems to have declined further thereafter , as two of his protégés , found guilty of accepting bribes , were punished by Leo . Nevertheless , in late summer 898 , following the death of Theophano in December 865 or 866 and of Zoe 's first husband <unk> in early 898 , Leo at last married Zoe , raising her to Augusta . In the next year , however , both Zoe and Stylianos died . Following their deaths , Leo proposed to marry yet again , choosing Eudokia <unk> as his wife . Zaoutzes 's numerous relatives , who had benefited from his patronage , were fearful of losing their positions to the new Empress 's relations , and conspired to overthrow Leo . Chief among them was Basil , Zoe 's nephew . The plot , however , was betrayed by the eunuch servant Samonas , and the conspiracy suppressed . The Zaoutzes relatives were exiled or confined to monasteries , and the clan 's power broken . Samonas himself was richly rewarded : he was taken into the imperial service and rapidly promoted , becoming parakoimomenos by 908 , before he too fell from favor . 
 = USS Cushing ( DD @-@ 55 ) = 
 USS Cushing ( Destroyer No. 55 / DD @-@ 55 ) was an O 'Brien @-@ class destroyer built for the United States Navy prior to the American entry into World War I. The ship was the second U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of William B. Cushing , a U.S. Navy officer best known for sinking the Confederate ironclad warship CSS Albemarle during the American Civil War . 
 Cushing was laid down by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy , Massachusetts , in September 1913 and launched in January 1915 . The ship was a little more than 305 feet ( 93 m ) in length , just over 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) abeam , and had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 050 long tons ( 1 @,@ 070 t ) . She was armed with four 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns and had eight 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . Cushing was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to 29 knots ( 54 km / h ) . 
 After her August 1915 commissioning , Cushing sailed off the east coast and in the Caribbean . She was one of seventeen destroyers sent out to rescue survivors from five victims of German submarine U @-@ 53 off the Lightship Nantucket in October 1916 . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , Cushing was sent overseas to patrol the Irish Sea out of Queenstown , Ireland . Cushing made several unsuccessful attacks on U @-@ boats , and rescued survivors of several ships sunk by the German craft . 
 Upon returning to the United States after the war , Cushing was placed in reserve in reduced commission . She was decommissioned at Philadelphia in August 1920 . She was struck for the Naval Vessel Register in January 1936 and sold for scrapping in June . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Cushing was authorized in March 1913 as the fifth of six ships of the O 'Brien class , which was an improved version of the Cassin @-@ class destroyers authorized in 1911 . Construction of the vessel was awarded to the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy , Massachusetts , which laid down her keel on 23 September 1913 . On 16 January 1915 , Cushing was launched by sponsor Miss M. L. Cushing , daughter of the ship 's namesake , William B. Cushing . The ship was the second ship named for Cushing , a U.S. Navy officer best known for sinking the Confederate ironclad warship Albemarle during the American Civil War . As built , the destroyer was 305 feet 3 inches ( 93 @.@ 04 m ) in overall length , 31 feet 1 inch ( 9 @.@ 47 m ) abeam , and drew 9 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 90 m ) . The ship had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 050 long tons ( 1 @,@ 070 t ) and displaced 1 @,@ 171 long tons ( 1 @,@ 190 t ) when fully loaded . 
 Cushing had two Zoelly steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers , and an additional pair triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each connected to one of the propeller shafts , for cruising purposes . Four oil @-@ burning White @-@ Forster boilers powered the engines , which could generate 17 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) , moving the ship at up to 29 knots ( 54 km / h ) . Cushing reached a maximum speed of 30 @.@ 59 knots ( 56 @.@ 65 km / h ; 35 @.@ 20 mph ) during sea trials on 25 May 1916 , with her engines running at 16 @,@ 621 horsepower ( 12 @,@ 394 kW ) . 
 Cushing 's main battery consisted of 4 × 4 in ( 100 mm ) / 50 caliber Mark 9 guns , with each gun weighing in excess of 6 @,@ 100 pounds ( 2 @,@ 800 kg ) . The guns fired 33 @-@ pound ( 15 kg ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles at 2 @,@ 900 feet per second ( 880 m / s ) . At an elevation of 20 ° , the guns had a range of 15 @,@ 920 yards ( 14 @,@ 560 m ) . 
 Cushing was also equipped with eight 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti @-@ aircraft guns for the O 'Brien @-@ class ships , as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines . From sources , it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Cushing or any of the other ships of the class . 
 = = Early career = = 
 USS Cushing was commissioned into the United States Navy on 21 August 1915 under the command of Lieutenant Commander T. A. <unk> . Cushing served on the Neutrality patrol off Rose Bank , New York , until 28 December 1915 . She sailed to the Caribbean for fleet maneuvers on 4 January 1916 and after joining in fleet tactical exercises off Portland , Maine , and gunnery exercises off Norfolk , Virginia , she reported to Newport , Rhode Island , on 27 September to test torpedoes at the Naval Torpedo Station . 
 At 05 : 30 on Sunday , 8 October 1916 , wireless reports came in of a German submarine stopping ships near the Lightship Nantucket , off the eastern end of Long Island . After an SOS from the British steamer West Point was received at about 12 : 30 , Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves ordered Cushing and other destroyers at Newport to attend to survivors . The American destroyers arrived on the scene about 17 : 00 when the U @-@ boat , U @-@ 53 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose , was in the process of stopping the Holland @-@ America Line cargo ship Blommersdijk . Shortly after , U @-@ 53 stopped the British passenger ship Stephano . After Rose had given passengers and crew aboard both ships adequate time to abandon them , he sank the pair . In total , 226 survivors from U @-@ 53 's five victims were rescued by the destroyer flotilla . 
 After finishing out the rest of 1916 at Newport , Cushing again joined in exercises in the Caribbean for the first three months of 1917 . 
 = = World War I = = 
 After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917 entering World War I , Cushing was put to sea from New York on 15 May 1917 with Cummings , Nicholson , O 'Brien , and Sampson . The destroyers arrived at Queenstown , Ireland , 24 May for duty in the war zone . 
 Cushing patrolled off the Irish coast , meeting and escorting convoys of merchant ships and troop transports to British ports and the French coast . German submarines were active in the area and Cushing conducted antisubmarine patrols and performed rescue work on the ships that were victims of U @-@ boats . On 4 June , she picked up 13 men adrift in a small boat , survivors of Italian brig Luisa . 
 The destroyer had a busy July . On the 7th , she assisted Perkins in rescuing survivors of the torpedoed and sinking British merchant ship SS <unk> . The next day she responded to an SOS from SS Onitsha , which was being chased by an enemy submarine , and picked up 54 survivors of SS <unk> which had already been sunk . On 16 July she escorted SS <unk> to safety after the merchantman had received five hits , and the same day fired on two submarines , U @-@ 49 and U @-@ 58 , at extremely long range following their attack on the Italian merchant vessel SS Lamia L. , from whom Cushing rescued 27 survivors . 
 On 12 September , five survivors from the British SS Vienna were saved after being adrift for 2 days . On 26 November , when RFA <unk> was torpedoed , Cushing stood by , giving damage control assistance which kept the merchantman from sinking , then escorted her into Queenstown . Cushing rejoined her convoy the next day . Continuing her convoy escort and patrol duty , Cushing on 23 April 1918 dropped fifteen depth charges on German submarine U @-@ 104 , damaging her severely ; HMS Jessamine sank U @-@ 104 later that same day . After 11 June 1918 , Cushing operated from Brest , France , escorting eleven troop convoys through the submarine zones into French ports , making two depth charge attacks without success in the process . 
 = = Postwar = = 
 Immediately after the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918 , Cushing remained in French waters . She towed Murray , which had grounded on rocks in a French harbor , into Brest on 3 December . However , Cushing departed for the United States on 21 December , arriving in New York on 6 January 1919 . She was placed in reduced commission on 1 July , and transferred to the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 6 April 1920 . In July , she was assigned the hull code of DD @-@ 55 under the U.S. Navy 's alphanumeric classification system . Cushing was decommissioned on 7 August . 
 On 1 July 1933 , she dropped the name Cushing to free it for a new destroyer of the same name , becoming known only as DD @-@ 55 . The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 7 January 1936 , and , on 30 June , was sold for scrapping in accordance with the London Naval Treaty for the limitation of naval armaments . 
 = League of Nations = 
 The League of Nations ( abbreviated as LN in English , La Société des Nations [ la <unk> de <unk> ̃ ] abbreviated as SDN or <unk> in French ) was an intergovernmental organisation founded on 10 January 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War . It was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace . Its primary goals , as stated in its Covenant , included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration . Other issues in this and related treaties included labour conditions , just treatment of native inhabitants , human and drug trafficking , arms trade , global health , prisoners of war , and protection of minorities in Europe . At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935 , it had 58 members . 
 The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years . The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions , keep to its economic sanctions , or provide an army when needed . However , the Great Powers were often reluctant to do so . Sanctions could hurt League members , so they were reluctant to comply with them . During the Second Italo @-@ Abyssinian War , when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting Red Cross medical tents , Benito Mussolini responded that " the League is very well when sparrows shout , but no good at all when eagles fall out . " 
 After a number of notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s , the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s . Germany withdrew from the League , as did Japan , Italy , Spain , and others . The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose , which was to prevent any future world war . The League lasted for 26 years ; the United Nations ( UN ) replaced it after the end of the Second World War on 20 April 1946 and inherited a number of agencies and organisations founded by the League .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The concept of a peaceful community of nations had been proposed as far back as 1795 , when Immanuel Kant 's Perpetual Peace : A Philosophical Sketch outlined the idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between states . Kant argued for the establishment of a peaceful world community , not in a sense of a global government , but in the hope that each state would declare itself a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings , thus promoting peaceful society worldwide . International co @-@ operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war . This period also saw the development of international law , with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime , and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes . 
 The forerunner of the League of Nations , the Inter @-@ Parliamentary Union , was formed by the peace activists William Randal Cremer and Frédéric Passy in 1889 . The organisation was international in scope , with a third of the members of parliaments ( in the 24 countries that had parliaments ) serving as members of the IPU by 1914 . Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means . Annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration . Its structure consisted of a council headed by a president , which would later be reflected in the structure of the League . 
 At the start of the 20th century , two power blocs emerged from alliances between the European Great Powers . It was these alliances that , at the start of the First World War in 1914 , drew all the major European powers into the conflict . This was the first major war in Europe between industrialised countries , and the first time in Western Europe that the results of industrialisation ( for example , mass production ) had been dedicated to war . The result of this industrialised warfare , which provided modern weapons , coupled with outdated 19th century strategies , led to an unprecedented casualty level : eight and a half million soldiers killed , an estimated 21 million wounded , and approximately 10 million civilian deaths . 
 By the time the fighting ended in November 1918 , the war had had a profound impact , affecting the social , political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage . Anti @-@ war sentiment rose across the world ; the First World War was described as " the war to end all wars " , and its possible causes were vigorously investigated . The causes identified included arms races , alliances , militaristic nationalism , secret diplomacy , and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit . One proposed remedy was the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament , open diplomacy , international co @-@ operation , restrictions on the right to wage war , and penalties that made war unattractive . 
 = = = Initial proposals = = = 
 At the start of the First World War the first schemes for international organisation to prevent future wars began to gain considerable public support , particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States . Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson , a British political scientist , coined the term " League of Nations " in 1914 and drafted a scheme for its organisation . Together with Lord Bryce , he played a leading role in the founding of the group of internationalist pacifists known as the Bryce Group , later the League of Nations Union . The group became steadily more influential among the public and as a pressure group within the then governing Liberal Party . In Dickinson 's 1915 pamphlet After the War he wrote of his " League of Peace " as being essentially an organisation for arbitration and conciliation . He felt that the secret diplomacy of the early twentieth century had brought about war and thus could write that , " the impossibility of war , I believe , would be increased in proportion as the issues of foreign policy should be known to and controlled by public opinion . " The ‘ Proposals ’ of the Bryce Group were circulated widely , both in England and the US , where they had a profound influence on the nascent international movement . 
 In 1915 , a similar body was set up in the United States by a group of like @-@ minded individuals , including William Howard Taft . It was called the League to Enforce Peace and was substantially based on the proposals of the Bryce Group . It advocated the use of arbitration in conflict resolution and the imposition of sanctions on aggressive countries . However , none of these early organisations envisioned a continuously functioning body ; with the exception of the Fabian Society in England , they maintained a legalistic approach that would limit the international body to a court of justice . The Fabians were the first to argue for a " Council " of states , necessarily the Great Powers , who would adjudicate world affairs , and for the creation of a permanent secretariat to enhance international co @-@ operation across a range of activities . 
 The British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918 , under the initiative of Lord Robert Cecil . The British committee was finally appointed in February 1918 . It was led by Walter Phillimore ( and became known as the Phillimore Committee ) , but also included Eyre Crowe , William Tyrrell , and Cecil Hurst . The recommendations of the so @-@ called Phillimore Commission included the establishment of a " Conference of Allied States " that would arbitrate disputes and impose sanctions on offending states . The proposals were approved by the British government , and much of the commission 's results were later incorporated into the Covenant of the League of Nations . 
 The French also drafted a much more far @-@ reaching proposal in June of that year ; they advocated annual meetings of a council to settle all disputes , as well as an " international army " to enforce its decisions . 
 The American President Woodrow Wilson instructed Edward House to draft a US plan which reflected Wilson 's own idealistic views ( first articulated in the Fourteen Points of January 1918 ) , as well as the work of the Phillimore Commission . The outcome of House 's work , and Wilson 's own first draft , proposed the termination of " unethical " state behavior , including forms of espionage and dishonesty . Methods of compulsion against recalcitrant states would include severe measures , such as " blockading and closing the frontiers of that power to commerce or intercourse with any part of the world and to use any force that may be necessary ... " 
 The two principal drafters and architects of the covenant of the League of Nations were Lord Robert Cecil ( a lawyer and diplomat ) and Jan Smuts ( a Commonwealth statesman ) . Smuts ' proposals included the creation of a Council of the great powers as permanent members and a non @-@ permanent selection of the minor states . He also proposed the creation of a Mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war . Cecil focused on the administrative side , and proposed annual Council meetings and quadrennial meetings for the Assembly of all members . He also argued for a large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League 's administrative duties . 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 , Wilson , Cecil , and Smuts all put forward their draft proposals . After lengthy negotiations between the delegates , the Hurst @-@ Miller draft was finally produced as a basis for the Covenant . After more negotiation and compromise , the delegates finally approved of the proposal to create the League of Nations ( French : Société des Nations , German : <unk> ) on 25 January 1919 . The final Covenant of the League of Nations was drafted by a special commission , and the League was established by Part I of the Treaty of Versailles . On 28 June 1919 , 44 states signed the Covenant , including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the Triple Entente or joined it during the conflict . 
 The League would be made up of a General Assembly ( representing all member states ) , an Executive Council ( with membership limited to major powers ) , and a permanent secretariat . Member states were expected to " respect and preserve as against external aggression " the territorial integrity of other members and to disarm " to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety . " All states were required to submit complaints for arbitration or judicial inquiry before going to war . The Executive Council would create a Permanent Court of International Justice to make judgements on the disputes . 
 Despite Wilson 's efforts to establish and promote the League , for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1919 , the United States did not join . Opposition in the Senate , particularly from two Republican politicians , Henry Cabot Lodge and William Borah , and especially in regard to Article X of the Covenant , ensured that the United States would not ratify the agreement . 
 The League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920 , six days after the Versailles Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations came into force . On 1 November 1920 , the headquarters of the League was moved from London to Geneva , where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920 . 
 = = Languages and symbols = = 
 The official languages of the League of Nations were French , English , and Spanish . The League considered adopting Esperanto as their working language and actively encouraging its use , but this proposal was never acted on . In 1921 , Lord Robert Cecil proposed the introduction of Esperanto into state schools of member nations , and a report was commissioned . When the report was presented two years later , it recommended the adoption of Cecil 's idea , a proposal that 11 delegates accepted . The strongest opposition came from the French delegate , Gabriel <unk> , partially to protect French , which he argued was already the international language . As a result of such opposition , the recommendation was not accepted . 
 In 1939 , a semi @-@ official emblem for the League of Nations emerged : two five @-@ pointed stars within a blue pentagon . They symbolised the Earth 's five continents and five " races " . A bow at the top displayed the English name ( " League of Nations " ) , while another at the bottom showed the French ( " Société des Nations " ) . 
 = = Principal organs = = 
 The main constitutional organs of the League were the Assembly , the Council , and the Permanent Secretariat . It also had two essential wings : the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Labour Organisation . In addition , there were a number of auxiliary agencies and commissions . Each organ 's budget was allocated by the Assembly ( the League was supported financially by its member states ) . 
 The relations between the Assembly and the Council and the competencies of each were for the most part not explicitly defined . Each body could deal with any matter within the sphere of competence of the League or affecting peace in the world . Particular questions or tasks might be referred to either . 
 Unanimity was required for the decisions of both the Assembly and the Council , except in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the admission of new members . This requirement was a reflection of the League 's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations ; the League sought solution by consent , not by dictation . However , in case of a dispute , the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity . 
 The Permanent Secretariat , established at the seat of the League at Geneva , comprised a body of experts in various spheres under the direction of the general secretary . Its principal sections were Political , Financial and Economics , Transit , Minorities and Administration ( administering the Saar and Danzig ) , Mandates , Disarmament , Health , Social ( Opium and Traffic in Women and Children ) , Intellectual Cooperation and International Bureaux , Legal , and Information . The staff of the Secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and the Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters , effectively acting as the League 's civil service . In 1931 the staff numbered 707 . 
 The Assembly consisted of representatives of all members of the League , with each state allowed up to three representatives and one vote . It met in Geneva and , after its initial sessions in 1920 , it convened once a year in September . The special functions of the Assembly included the admission of new members , the periodical election of non @-@ permanent members to the Council , the election with the Council of the judges of the Permanent Court , and control of the budget . In practice , the Assembly was the general directing force of League activities . 
 The League Council acted as a type of executive body directing the Assembly 's business . It began with four permanent members ( Great Britain , France , Italy , Japan ) and four non @-@ permanent members that were elected by the Assembly for a three @-@ year term . The first non @-@ permanent members were Belgium , Brazil , Greece , and Spain . 
 The composition of the Council was changed a number of times . The number of non @-@ permanent members was first increased to six on 22 September 1922 and to nine on 8 September 1926 . Werner <unk> of Germany pushed for his country to join the League ; joining in 1926 , Germany became the fifth permanent member of the Council . Later , after Germany and Japan both left the League , the number of non @-@ permanent seats was increased from nine to eleven , and the Soviet Union was made a permanent member giving the Council a total of fifteen members . The Council met , on average , five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when required . In total , 107 sessions were held between 1920 and 1939 . 
 = = = Other bodies = = = 
 The League oversaw the Permanent Court of International Justice and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems . These included the Disarmament Commission , the Health Organisation , the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) , the Mandates Commission , the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation ( precursor to UNESCO ) , the Permanent Central Opium Board , the Commission for Refugees , and the Slavery Commission . Three of these institutions were transferred to the United Nations after the Second World War : the International Labour Organisation , the Permanent Court of International Justice ( as the International Court of Justice ) , and the Health Organisation ( restructured as the World Health Organisation ) . 
 The Permanent Court of International Justice was provided for by the Covenant , but not established by it . The Council and the Assembly established its constitution . Its judges were elected by the Council and the Assembly , and its budget was provided by the latter . The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it . It might also give an advisory opinion on any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly . The Court was open to all the nations of the world under certain broad conditions . 
 The International Labour Organisation was created in 1919 on the basis of Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles . The ILO , although having the same members as the League and being subject to the budget control of the Assembly , was an autonomous organisation with its own Governing Body , its own General Conference and its own Secretariat . Its constitution differed from that of the League : representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers ' and workers ' organisations . Albert Thomas was its first director . 
 The ILO successfully restricted the addition of lead to paint , and convinced several countries to adopt an eight @-@ hour work day and forty @-@ eight @-@ hour working week . It also campaigned to end child labour , increase the rights of women in the workplace , and make shipowners liable for accidents involving seamen . After the demise of the League , the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946 . 
 The League 's health organisation had three bodies : the Health Bureau , containing permanent officials of the League ; the General Advisory Council or Conference , an executive section consisting of medical experts ; and the Health Committee . The Committee 's purpose was to conduct inquiries , oversee the operation of the League 's health work , and prepare work to be presented to the Council . This body focused on ending leprosy , malaria , and yellow fever , the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes . The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the Soviet Union to prevent typhus epidemics , including organising a large education campaign . 
 The League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of international intellectual co @-@ operation since its creation . The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation of intellectual work , which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva in August 1922 . The French philosopher Henri Bergson became the first chairman of the committee . The work of the committee included : inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life , assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered , creation of national committees for intellectual co @-@ operation , co @-@ operation with international intellectual organisations , protection of intellectual property , inter @-@ university co @-@ operation , co @-@ ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications , and international co @-@ operation in archaeological research . 
 Introduced by the second International Opium Convention , the Permanent Central Opium Board had to supervise the statistical reports on trade in opium , morphine , cocaine and heroin . The board also established a system of import certificates and export <unk> for the legal international trade in narcotics . 
 The Slavery Commission sought to eradicate slavery and slave trading across the world , and fought forced prostitution . Its main success was through pressing the governments who administered mandated countries to end slavery in those countries . The League secured a commitment from Ethiopia to end slavery as a condition of membership in 1923 , and worked with Liberia to abolish forced labour and intertribal slavery . The United Kingdom had not supported Ethiopian membership of the League on the grounds that " Ethiopia had not reached a state of civilisation and internal security sufficient to warrant her admission . " 
 The League also succeeded in reducing the death rate of workers constructing the Tanganyika railway from 55 to 4 percent . Records were kept to control slavery , prostitution , and the trafficking of women and children . Partly as a result of pressure brought by the League of Nations , Afghanistan abolished slavery in 1923 , Iraq in 1924 , Nepal in 1926 , Transjordan and Persia in 1929 , Bahrain in 1937 , and Ethiopia in 1942 . 
 Led by Fridtjof Nansen , the Commission for Refugees was established on 27 June 1921 to look after the interests of refugees , including overseeing their repatriation and , when necessary , resettlement . At the end of the First World War , there were two to three million ex @-@ prisoners of war from various nations dispersed throughout Russia ; within two years of the commission 's foundation , it had helped 425 @,@ 000 of them return home . It established camps in Turkey in 1922 to aid the country with an ongoing refugee crisis , helping to prevent disease and hunger . It also established the Nansen passport as a means of identification for stateless people . 
 The Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women sought to inquire into the status of women all over the world . It was formed in 1937 , and later became part of the United Nations as the Commission on the Status of Women . 
 = = Members = = 
 Of the League 's 42 founding members , 23 ( 24 counting Free France ) remained members until it was dissolved in 1946 . In the founding year , six other states joined , only two of which remained members throughout the League 's existence . An additional 15 countries joined later . The largest number of member states was 58 , between 28 September 1934 ( when Ecuador joined ) and 23 February 1935 ( when Paraguay withdrew ) . 
 The Soviet Union became a member on 18 September 1934 , and was expelled on 14 December 1939 for invading Finland . In expelling the Soviet Union , the League broke its own rule : only 7 of 15 members of the Council voted for expulsion ( United Kingdom , France , Belgium , Bolivia , Egypt , South Africa , and the Dominican Republic ) , short of the majority required by the Covenant . Three of these members had been made Council members the day before the vote ( South Africa , Bolivia , and Egypt ) . This was one of the League 's final acts before it practically ceased functioning due to the Second World War . 
 On 26 May 1937 , Egypt became the last state to join the League . The first member to withdraw permanently from the League was Costa Rica on 22 January 1925 ; having joined on 16 December 1920 , this also makes it the member to have most quickly withdrawn . Brazil was the first founding member to withdraw ( 14 June 1926 ) , and Haiti the last ( April 1942 ) . Iraq , which joined in 1932 , was the first member that had previously been a League of Nations mandate . 
 = = Mandates = = 
 At the end of the First World War , the Allied powers were confronted with the question of the disposal of the former German colonies in Africa and the Pacific , and the several non @-@ Turkish provinces of the Ottoman Empire . The Peace Conference adopted the principle that these territories should be administered by different governments on behalf of the League – a system of national responsibility subject to international supervision . This plan , defined as the mandate system , was adopted by the " Council of Ten " ( the heads of government and foreign ministers of the main Allied powers : Britain , France , the United States , Italy , and Japan ) on 30 January 1919 and transmitted to the League of Nations . 
 League of Nations mandates were established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations . The Permanent Mandates Commission supervised League of Nations mandates , and also organised plebiscites in disputed territories so that residents could decide which country they would join . There were three mandate classifications : A , B and C. 
 The A mandates ( applied to parts of the old Ottoman Empire ) were " certain communities " that had 
 ... reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone . The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory . 
 The B mandates were applied to the former German colonies that the League took responsibility for after the First World War . These were described as " peoples " that the League said were 
 ... at such a stage that the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion , subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals , the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade , the arms traffic and the liquor traffic , and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory , and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other Members of the League . 
 South @-@ West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands were administered by League members under C mandates . These were classified as " territories " 
 ... which , owing to the sparseness of their population , or their small size , or their remoteness from the centres of civilisation , or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory , and other circumstances , can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory , subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population . " 
 = = = Mandatory powers = = = 
 The territories were governed by mandatory powers , such as the United Kingdom in the case of the Mandate of Palestine , and the Union of South Africa in the case of South @-@ West Africa , until the territories were deemed capable of self @-@ government . Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers : the United Kingdom , the Union of South Africa , France , Belgium , New Zealand , Australia and Japan . With the exception of the Kingdom of Iraq , which joined the League on 3 October 1932 , these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War , in a process that did not end until 1990 . Following the demise of the League , most of the remaining mandates became United Nations Trust Territories . 
 In addition to the mandates , the League itself governed the Territory of the Saar Basin for 15 years , before it was returned to Germany following a plebiscite , and the Free City of Danzig ( now Gdańsk , Poland ) from 15 November 1920 to 1 September 1939 . 
 = = Resolving territorial disputes = = 
 The aftermath of the First World War left many issues to be settled , including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join . Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council . The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League . This meant that , during the early interwar period , the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war . The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties . 
 As the League developed , its role expanded , and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity . This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non @-@ members . The United States and Russia , for example , increasingly worked with the League . During the second half of the 1920s , France , Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity , and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period . They also used the League 's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences . 
 = = = Åland Islands = = = 
 Åland is a collection of around 6 @,@ 500 islands in the Baltic Sea , midway between Sweden and Finland . The islands are almost exclusively Swedish @-@ speaking , but in 1809 , the Åland Islands , along with Finland , were taken by Imperial Russia . In December 1917 , during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution , Finland declared its independence , but most of the <unk> wished to rejoin Sweden . However , the Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation , as the Russians had included Åland in the Grand Duchy of Finland , formed in 1809 . By 1920 , the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war . The British government referred the problem to the League 's Council , but Finland would not let the League intervene , as they considered it an internal matter . The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and , with an affirmative response , a neutral commission was created . In June 1921 , the League announced its decision : the islands were to remain a part of Finland , but with guaranteed protection of the islanders , including demilitarisation . With Sweden 's reluctant agreement , this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League . 
 = = = Upper Silesia = = = 
 The Allied powers referred the problem of Upper Silesia to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute . After the First World War , Poland laid claim to Upper Silesia , which had been part of Prussia . The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a plebiscite in Upper Silesia to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland . Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two Silesian Uprisings ( 1919 and 1920 ) . A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921 , with 59 @.@ 6 percent ( around 500 @,@ 000 ) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany , but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair . This result led to the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921 . 
 On 12 August 1921 , the League was asked to settle the matter ; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium , Brazil , China and Spain to study the situation . The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas – for example , whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependency of the two areas . In November 1921 , a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland . A final settlement was reached , after five meetings , in which most of the area was given to Germany , but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region 's mineral resources and much of its industry . When this agreement became public in May 1922 , bitter resentment was expressed in Germany , but the treaty was still ratified by both countries . The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War . 
 = = = Albania = = = 
 The frontiers of Albania had not been set during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 , as they were left for the League to decide ; however , they had not yet been determined by September 1921 , creating an unstable situation . Greek troops held military operations in the south of Albania . Yugoslavian forces became engaged , after clashes with Albanian tribesmen , in the northern part of the country . The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region . In November 1921 , the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913 , with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia . Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later , albeit under protest . 
 The borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General Enrico Tellini and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania . Italian leader Benito Mussolini was incensed , and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days . Whatever the results of the investigation , Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million lire in reparations . The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks . 
 Mussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of Corfu , and Italian forces occupied the island on 31 August 1923 . This contravened the League 's covenant , so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation . The Allies , however , agreed ( at Mussolini 's insistence ) that the Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini . The League Council examined the dispute , but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision . The conference accepted most of the League 's recommendations , forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy , even though those who committed the crime were never discovered . Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu . 
 = = = Memel = = = 
 The port city of Memel ( now Klaipėda ) and the surrounding area , with a predominantly German population , was under provisional Allied control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles . The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an international city , while Lithuania wanted to annex the area . By 1923 , the fate of the area had still not been decided , prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port . After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania , they referred the matter to the League of Nations . In December 1923 , the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry . The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights . The Klaipėda Convention was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924 , and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania . In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the Nazis and an ultimatum to Lithuania , demanding the return of the region under threat of war . The League of Nations failed to prevent the secession of the Memel region to Germany . 
 = = = Hatay = = = 
 With League oversight , the Sanjak of Alexandretta in the French Mandate of Syria was given autonomy in 1937 . Renamed Hatay , its parliament declared independence as the Republic of Hatay in September 1938 , after elections the previous month . It was annexed by Turkey with French consent in mid @-@ 1939 . 
 = = = Mosul = = = 
 The League resolved a dispute between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey over control of the former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926 . According to the British , who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs , Mosul belonged to Iraq ; on the other hand , the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland . A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry , with Belgian , Hungarian and Swedish members , was sent to the region in 1924 ; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq , but if they had to choose , they would pick Iraq . In 1925 , the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq , under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years , to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population . The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq . Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations ' arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 , it rejected the decision , questioning the Council 's authority . The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice , which ruled that , when the Council made a unanimous decision , it must be accepted . Nonetheless , Britain , Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq . It was agreed , however , that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admittance . 
 = = = Vilnius = = = 
 After the First World War , Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes . During the Polish – Soviet War , Lithuania signed the Moscow Peace Treaty with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania 's frontiers . This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of Vilnius ( Lithuanian : Vilnius , Polish : Wilno ) , the old Lithuanian capital , but a city with a majority Polish population . This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the Polish – Lithuanian War , and on 7 October 1920 , the League negotiated the Suwałki Agreement establishing a cease @-@ fire and a demarcation line between the two nations . On 9 October 1920 , General Lucjan Żeligowski , commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwałki Agreement , took the city and established the Republic of Central Lithuania . 
 After a request for assistance from Lithuania , the League Council called for Poland 's withdrawal from the area . The Polish government indicated they would comply , but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops . This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League . However , the plan was met with resistance in Poland , Lithuania , and the Soviet Union , which opposed any international force in Lithuania . In March 1921 , the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite . After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania , Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922 . After Lithuania took over the Klaipėda Region , the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland , leaving Vilnius within Poland , on 14 March 1923 . Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision , and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927 . It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders . 
 = = = Colombia and Peru = = = 
 There were several border conflicts between Colombia and Peru in the early part of the 20th century , and in 1922 , their governments signed the Salomón @-@ Lozano Treaty in an attempt to resolve them . As part of this treaty , the border town of Leticia and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia , giving Colombia access to the Amazon River . On 1 September 1932 , business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land as a result organised an armed takeover of Leticia . At first , the Peruvian government did not recognise the military takeover , but President of Peru Luis Sánchez Cerro decided to resist a Colombian re @-@ occupation . The Peruvian Army occupied Leticia , leading to an armed conflict between the two nations . After months of diplomatic negotiations , the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations , and their representatives presented their cases before the Council . A provisional peace agreement , signed by both parties in May 1933 , provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded . In May 1934 , a final peace agreement was signed , resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia , a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion , demilitarisation of the area around Leticia , free navigation on the Amazon and <unk> Rivers , and a pledge of non @-@ aggression . 
 = = = Saar = = = 
 Saar was a province formed from parts of Prussia and the Rhenish Palatinate and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles . A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the province should belong to Germany or France . When the referendum was held in 1935 , 90 @.@ 3 percent of voters supported becoming part of Germany , which was quickly approved by the League Council . 
 = = Other conflicts = = 
 In addition to territorial disputes , the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations . Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery , and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees , particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926 . One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport , which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees . 
 = = = Greece and Bulgaria = = = 
 After an incident involving sentries on the Greek @-@ Bulgarian border in October 1925 , fighting began between the two countries . Three days after the initial incident , Greek troops invaded Bulgaria . The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to make only token resistance , and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region , trusting the League to settle the dispute . The League condemned the Greek invasion , and called for both Greek withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria . 
 = = = Liberia = = = 
 Following accusations of forced labour on the large American @-@ owned Firestone rubber plantation and American accusations of slave trading , the Liberian government asked the League to launch an investigation . The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League , the United States , and Liberia . In 1930 , a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour . The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans , which generated anger within Liberia and led to the resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice @-@ president . The Liberian government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms . 
 = = = Mukden Incident = = = 
 The Mukden Incident , also known as the " Manchurian Incident " or the " Far Eastern Crisis " , was one of the League 's major setbacks and acted as the catalyst for Japan 's withdrawal from the organisation . Under the terms of an agreed lease , the Japanese government had the right to station its troops in the area around the South Manchurian Railway , a major trade route between the two countries , in the Chinese region of Manchuria . In September 1931 , a section of the railway was lightly damaged by the Japanese Kwantung Army as a pretext for an invasion of Manchuria . The Japanese army claimed that Chinese soldiers had sabotaged the railway and in apparent retaliation ( acting contrary to the civilian government 's orders ) occupied the entire region of Manchuria . They renamed the area Manchukuo , and on 9 March 1932 set up a puppet government , with Pu Yi , the former emperor of China , as its executive head . This new entity was recognised only by the governments of Italy and Nazi Germany ; the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China . In 1932 , Japanese air and sea forces bombarded the Chinese city of Shanghai , sparking the January 28 Incident . 
 The League of Nations agreed to a request for help from the Chinese government , but the long voyage by ship delayed League officials . When they arrived , they were confronted with Chinese assertions that the Japanese had invaded unlawfully , while the Japanese claimed they were acting to keep peace in the area . Despite Japan 's high standing in the League , the subsequent Lytton Report declared Japan to be the aggressor and demanded Manchuria be returned to the Chinese . Before the report could be voted on by the Assembly , Japan announced its intention to push further into China . The report passed 42 – 1 in the Assembly in 1933 ( only Japan voting against ) , but instead of removing its troops from China , Japan withdrew from the League . 
 According to the Covenant , the League should have responded by enacting economic sanctions or declaring war ; it did neither . The threat of economic sanctions would have been almost useless because the United States , a non – League member , could continue trade with Japan . The League could have assembled an army , but major powers like Britain and France were too preoccupied with their own affairs , such as keeping control of their extensive colonies , especially after the turmoil of the First World War . Japan was therefore left in control of Manchuria until the Soviet Union 's Red Army took over the area and returned it to China at the end of the Second World War . 
 = = = Chaco War = = = 
 The League failed to prevent the 1932 war between Bolivia and Paraguay over the arid Gran Chaco region . Although the region was sparsely populated , it contained the Paraguay River , which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean , and there was also speculation , later proved incorrect , that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum . Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all @-@ out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio López at Lake <unk> . Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations , but the League did not take action when the Pan @-@ American Conference offered to mediate instead . The war was a disaster for both sides , causing 57 @,@ 000 casualties for Bolivia , whose population was around three million , and 36 @,@ 000 dead for Paraguay , whose population was approximately one million . It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster . By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on 12 June 1935 , Paraguay had seized control of most of the region , as was later recognised by the 1938 truce . 
 = = = Italian invasion of Abyssinia = = = 
 In October 1935 , Italian dictator Benito Mussolini sent 400 @,@ 000 troops to invade Abyssinia ( Ethiopia ) . Marshal Pietro Badoglio led the campaign from November 1935 , ordering bombing , the use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas , and the poisoning of water supplies , against targets which included undefended villages and medical facilities . The modern Italian Army defeated the poorly armed Abyssinians and captured Addis Ababa in May 1936 , forcing Emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie to flee . 
 The League of Nations condemned Italy 's aggression and imposed economic sanctions in November 1935 , but the sanctions were largely ineffective since they did not ban the sale of oil or close the Suez Canal ( controlled by Britain ) . As Stanley Baldwin , the British Prime Minister , later observed , this was ultimately because no one had the military forces on hand to withstand an Italian attack . In October 1935 , the US President , Franklin D. Roosevelt , invoked the recently passed Neutrality Acts and placed an embargo on arms and munitions to both sides , but extended a further " moral embargo " to the belligerent Italians , including other trade items . On 5 October and later on 29 February 1936 , the United States endeavoured , with limited success , to limit its exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels . The League sanctions were lifted on 4 July 1936 , but by that point Italy had already gained control of the urban areas of Abyssinia . 
 The Hoare – Laval Pact of December 1935 was an attempt by the British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval to end the conflict in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector . Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact , but news of the deal leaked out . Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it , describing it as a sell @-@ out of Abyssinia . Hoare and Laval were forced to resign , and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from the two men . In June 1936 , although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person , Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly , appealing for its help in protecting his country . 
 The Abyssinian crisis showed how the League could be influenced by the self @-@ interest of its members ; one of the reasons why the sanctions were not very harsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving Mussolini and Adolf Hitler into an alliance . 
 = = = Spanish Civil War = = = 
 On 17 July 1936 , the Spanish Army launched a coup d 'état , leading to a prolonged armed conflict between Spanish Republicans ( the elected leftist national government ) and the Nationalists ( conservative , anti @-@ communist rebels who included most officers of the Spanish Army ) . Julio Álvarez del <unk> , the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs , appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend Spain 's territorial integrity and political independence . The League members , however , would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict . Adolf Hitler and Mussolini continued to aid General Francisco Franco 's Nationalists , while the Soviet Union helped the Spanish Republic . In February 1937 , the League did ban foreign volunteers , but this was in practice a symbolic move . 
 = = = Second Sino @-@ Japanese War = = = 
 Following a long record of instigating localised conflicts throughout the 1930s , Japan began a full @-@ scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937 . On 12 September , the Chinese representative , Wellington Koo , appealed to the League for international intervention . Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle , particularly in their stubborn defence of Shanghai , a city with a substantial number of foreigners . However , the League was unable to provide any practical measures ; on 4 October , it turned the case over to the Nine Power Treaty Conference . 
 = = Failure of disarmament = = 
 Article 8 of the Covenant gave the League the task of reducing " armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations . " A significant amount of the League 's time and energy was devoted to this goal , even though many member governments were uncertain that such extensive disarmament could be achieved or was even desirable . The Allied powers were also under obligation by the Treaty of Versailles to attempt to disarm , and the armament restrictions imposed on the defeated countries had been described as the first step toward worldwide disarmament . The League Covenant assigned the League the task of creating a disarmament plan for each state , but the Council devolved this responsibility to a special commission set up in 1926 to prepare for the 1932 – 34 World Disarmament Conference . Members of the League held different views towards the issue . The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked ; Poland and Czechoslovakia felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League 's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed . Without this guarantee , they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great . Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War , especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became German Chancellor in 1933 . In particular , Germany 's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm . 
 The World Disarmament Conference was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932 , with representatives from 60 states . A one @-@ year moratorium on the expansion of armaments , later extended by a few months , was proposed at the start of the conference . The Disarmament Commission obtained initial agreement from France , Italy , Japan , and Britain to limit the size of their navies . The Kellogg – Briand Pact , facilitated by the commission in 1928 , failed in its objective of outlawing war . Ultimately , the Commission failed to halt the military build @-@ up by Germany , Italy and Japan during the 1930s . The League was mostly silent in the face of major events leading to the Second World War , such as Hitler 's remilitarisation of the Rhineland , occupation of the Sudetenland and Anschluss of Austria , which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles . In fact , League members themselves re @-@ armed . In 1933 , Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement , as did Germany the same year ( using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext ) , and Italy in 1937 . The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after it invaded Finland . 
 = = General weaknesses = = 
 The onset of the Second World War demonstrated that the League had failed in its primary purpose , the prevention of another world war . There were a variety of reasons for this failure , many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation . Additionally , the power of the League was limited by the United States ' refusal to join . 
 = = = Origins and structure = = = 
 The origins of the League as an organisation created by the Allied powers as part of the peace settlement to end the First World War led to it being viewed as a " League of Victors " . The League 's neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision . It required a unanimous vote of nine , later fifteen , Council members to enact a resolution ; hence , conclusive and effective action was difficult , if not impossible . It was also slow in coming to its decisions , as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly . This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries , and by enforcing unanimous voting had effectively given themselves veto power . 
 = = = Global representation = = = 
 Representation at the League was often a problem . Though it was intended to encompass all nations , many never joined , or their period of membership was short . The most conspicuous absentee was the United States . President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League 's formation and strongly influenced the form it took , but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919 . Ruth Henig has suggested that , had the United States become a member , it would have also provided support to France and Britain , possibly making France feel more secure , and so encouraging France and Britain to co @-@ operate more fully regarding Germany , thus making the rise to power of the Nazi Party less likely . Conversely , Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member , its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with international incidents . The structure of the US federal government might also have made its membership problematic , as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the executive branch without having the prior approval of the legislative branch . 
 In January 1920 , when the League was born , Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War . Soviet Russia was also initially excluded , as Communist regimes were not welcomed . The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s . Japan began as a permanent member of the Council , but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its invasion of Manchuria . Italy also began as a permanent member of the Council , but withdrew in 1937 . The League had accepted Germany , also as a permanent member of the Council , in 1926 , deeming it a " peace @-@ loving country " , but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933 . 
 = = = Collective security = = = 
 Another important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of collective security that formed the basis of the League and international relations between individual states . The League 's collective security system required nations to act , if necessary , against states they considered friendly , and in a way that might endanger their national interests , to support states for which they had no normal affinity . This weakness was exposed during the Abyssinia Crisis , when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe " to defend against the enemies of internal order " , in which Italy 's support played a pivotal role , with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League . 
 On 23 June 1936 , in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy 's war against Abyssinia , the British Prime Minister , Stanley Baldwin , told the House of Commons that collective security had 
 failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... The real reason , or the main reason , was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... [ I ] f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about , it means not only that every country is to be ready for war ; but must be ready to go to war at once . That is a terrible thing , but it is an essential part of collective security . 
 Ultimately , Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of appeasement in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler . In this context , the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseille , showing its conspiratorial features , many of which are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after 9 / 11 . 
 = = = Pacifism and disarmament = = = 
 The League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions , which they were very unwilling to do . Its two most important members , Britain and France , were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League . Immediately after the First World War , pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries . The British Conservatives were especially tepid to the League and preferred , when in government , to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation . Moreover , the League 's advocacy of disarmament for Britain , France , and its other members , while at the same time advocating collective security , meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority . 
 When the British cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the First World War , Maurice Hankey , the Cabinet Secretary , circulated a memorandum on the subject . He started by saying , " Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us , because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious " . He attacked the British pre @-@ war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming : 
 It [ a League of Nations ] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep . It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well @-@ meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government , who deprecate expenditure on armaments , and , in the course of time , it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage . 
 The Foreign Office minister Sir Eyre Crowe also wrote a memorandum to the British cabinet claiming that " a solemn league and covenant " would just be " a treaty , like other treaties " . " What is there to ensure that it will not , like other treaties , be broken ? " Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned " pledge of common action " against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power . He also criticised the proposal for League economic sanctions because it would be ineffectual and that " It is all a question of real military preponderance " . Universal disarmament was a practical impossibility , Crowe warned . 
 = = Demise and legacy = = 
 As the situation in Europe escalated into war , the Assembly transferred enough power to the Secretary General on 30 September 1938 and 14 December 1939 to allow the League to continue to exist legally and carry on reduced operations . The headquarters of the League , the Palace of Nations , remained unoccupied for nearly six years until the Second World War ended . 
 At the 1943 Tehran Conference , the Allied powers agreed to create a new body to replace the League : the United Nations . Many League bodies , such as the International Labour Organisation , continued to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN . The designers of the structures of the United Nations intended to make it more effective than the League . 
 The final meeting of the League of Nations took place on 18 April 1946 in Geneva . Delegates from 34 nations attended the assembly . This session concerned itself with liquidating the League : it transferred assets worth approximately $ 22 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( U.S. ) in 1946 , ( including the Palace of Peace and the League 's archives ) to the UN , returned reserve funds to the nations that had supplied them , and settled the debts of the League . Robert Cecil , addressing the final session , said : 
 Let us boldly state that aggression wherever it occurs and however it may be defended , is an international crime , that it is the duty of every peace @-@ loving state to resent it and employ whatever force is necessary to crush it , that the machinery of the Charter , no less than the machinery of the Covenant , is sufficient for this purpose if properly used , and that every well @-@ disposed citizen of every state should be ready to undergo any sacrifice in order to maintain peace ... I venture to impress upon my hearers that the great work of peace is resting not only on the narrow interests of our own nations , but even more on those great principles of right and wrong which nations , like individuals , depend . 
 The League is dead . Long live the United Nations . 
 The Assembly passed a resolution that " With effect from the day following the close of the present session of the Assembly [ i.e. , April 19 ] , the League of Nations shall cease to exist except for the sole purpose of the liquidation of its affairs as provided in the present resolution . " A Board of Liquidation consisting of nine persons from different countries spent the next 15 months overseeing the transfer of the League 's assets and functions to the United Nations or specialised bodies , finally dissolving itself on July 31 , 1947 . 
 Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were " institutionalized " , as opposed to the pre – First World War methods of law and politics . The principal Allies in the Second World War ( the UK , the USSR , France , the U.S. , and the Republic of China ) became permanent members of the United Nations Security Council in 1946 . ( In 1971 the People 's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China ( then only in control of Taiwan ) as permanent member of the UN Security Council , and in 1991 the Russian Federation replaced the USSR . ) Decisions of the Security Council are binding on all members of the UN ; however , unanimous decisions are not required , unlike in the League Council . Permanent members of the Security Council can wield a veto to protect their vital interests . 
 Like its predecessor , the United Nations does not have its own standing armed forces , but calls on its members to contribute to armed interventions , such as during the Korean War and for the peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia . 
 = Yugoslav monitor Sava = 
 The Yugoslav monitor Sava was a Temes @-@ class river monitor built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy as SMS Bodrog . She fired the first shots of World War I on the night of 28 July 1914 , when she and two other monitors shelled Serbian defences near Belgrade . She was part of the Danube Flotilla , and fought the Serbian and Romanian armies from Belgrade to the mouth of the Danube . In the closing stages of the war , she was the last monitor to withdraw towards Budapest , but was captured by the Serbs when she grounded on a sandbank downstream from Belgrade . After the war , she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) , and renamed Sava . 
 During the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , Sava served with the 1st Monitor Division . Along with her fellow monitor Vardar , she laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border during the first few days of the invasion . The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe , but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade . Due to high river levels and low bridges , navigation was difficult , and Sava was scuttled on 11 April . Some of her crew tried to escape cross @-@ country towards the southern Adriatic coast , but all were captured prior to the Yugoslav surrender . The vessel was later raised by the navy of the Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia and continued to serve as Sava until the night of 8 September 1944 when she was again scuttled . 
 Following World War II , Sava was raised once again , and was refurbished to serve in the Yugoslav Navy from 1952 to 1962 . She was then transferred to a state @-@ owned company that was eventually privatised . As of 2014 , Sava was still in service as a gravel barge . In 2005 , the government of Serbia granted her limited heritage protection after citizens demanded that she be preserved as a floating museum , but little else has been done to restore her .

 A Temes @-@ class river monitor , the ship was built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy by H. Schönichen , and designed by Austrian naval architect Josef Thiel . Originally named SMS Bodrog , she was laid down at <unk> on 14 February 1903 . Like her sister ship SMS Temes , she had an overall length of 57 @.@ 7 m ( 189 ft 4 in ) , a beam of 9 @.@ 5 m ( 31 ft 2 in ) , and a normal draught of 1 @.@ 2 m ( 3 ft 11 in ) . Her standard displacement was 440 tonnes ( 430 long tons ) , and her crew consisted of 86 officers and enlisted men . Bodrog had two triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller shaft . Steam was provided by two Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers , and her engines were rated at 1 @,@ 400 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 000 kW ) . As designed , she had a maximum speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) , and carried 62 tonnes ( 61 long tons ) of coal . 
 Bodrog was armed with two 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 35 guns in single gun turrets , a single 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 10 howitzer in a central pivot mount , and two 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . The maximum range of her Škoda 120 mm guns was 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) , and her howitzer could fire its 20 kg ( 44 lb ) shells a maximum of 6 @.@ 2 km ( 3 @.@ 9 mi ) . Her armour consisted of belt , bulkheads and gun turrets 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick , and deck armour 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick . The armour on her conning tower was 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) thick . Bodrog was launched on 12 April 1904 , commissioned on 2 August 1904 , and completed on 10 November 1904 .

 Bodrog was part of the Danube Flotilla , and at the start of World War I she was based in Zemun , just upstream from Belgrade on the Danube , under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant ( LSL ) Paul Ekl . She shared the base with three other monitors and three patrol boats . Austria @-@ Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914 , and that night Bodrog and two other monitors fired the first shots of the war against Serb fortifications on the Zemun – Belgrade railway bridge over the Sava river and on Topčider Hill . The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors , and by August began to receive assistance from the Russians . This support included the supply and emplacement of naval guns and the establishment of river obstacles and mines . On 8 September , the Austro @-@ Hungarian base at Zemun was evacuated in the face of a Serbian counterattack . Bodrog and the minesweeper Andor conducted a deception operation towards Pančevo on 19 September , and six days later , Bodrog bombarded Serb positions on the bank of the Sava near Belgrade . On 28 September , she rendezvoused with the monitor SMS Szamos at <unk> , and the following day the two monitors targeted the Belgrade Fortress and conducted a reconnaissance of Zemun . On 1 October , Bodrog sailed to Budapest , where she was placed in dry dock for two weeks . She returned to the flotilla on 15 October . By November , French artillery support had arrived in Belgrade , endangering the monitor 's anchorage , and on 12 November , Ekl was replaced by LSL Olaf Wulff . The stalemate continued until the following month , when the Serbs evacuated Belgrade in the face of an Austro @-@ Hungarian assault . On 1 December , Bodrog and the newly commissioned monitor SMS Enns engaged the retreating Serbs . After less than two weeks , the Austro @-@ Hungarians retreated from Belgrade , and it was soon recaptured by the Serbs with Russian and French support . Bodrog continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until December , when her base was withdrawn to Petrovaradin , near Novi Sad , for the winter . 
 The Germans and Austro @-@ Hungarians wanted to transport munitions down the Danube to the Ottoman Empire , so on 24 December 1914 , Bodrog and the minesweeper Almos escorted the steamer <unk> loaded with munitions , the patrol boat b and two tugs from Zemun past Belgrade towards the Iron Gates gorge on the Serbian – Romanian border . The convoy ran the gauntlet of the Belgrade defences unharmed , but when it reached Smederevo it received information that the Russians had established a minefield and log barrier just south of the Iron Gates . It turned back under heavy fire , and withdrew as far as Pančevo without serious damage to any vessel . Bodrog returned to base , and the monitor SMS Inn was sent to guard the munitions and escort the convoy back to Petrovaradin . In January 1915 , British artillery arrived in Belgrade , further bolstering its defences , and Bodrog spent the first months of the year at Zemun . On 23 February , LSL <unk> Böhm took command . On 1 March , Bodrog and several other vessels including the monitor SMS Körös were relocated to Petrovaradin . After the commencement of the Gallipoli campaign , munitions supply to the Ottomans became critical , so another attempt was planned . On 30 March , the steamer Belgrad left Zemun , escorted by Bodrog and Enns . The convoy was undetected as it sailed past Belgrade at night during a storm , but after the monitors returned to base , Belgrad struck a mine near Vinča , and after coming under heavy artillery fire , exploded near Ritopek . On 22 April 1915 , a British picket boat that had been brought overland by rail from Salonika was used to attack the Danube Flotilla anchorage at Zemun , firing two torpedoes without success . 
 In September 1915 , the Central Powers were joined by Bulgaria , and the Serbian Army soon faced an overwhelming Austro @-@ Hungarian , German and Bulgarian ground invasion . In early October , the Austro @-@ Hungarian 3rd Army attacked Belgrade , and Bodrog , along with the majority of the flotilla , was heavily engaged in support of crossings near the Belgrade Fortress and the island of Ada Ciganlija . 
 = = = = Romanian campaign = = = = 
 Following the capture of Belgrade on 11 October and the initial clearance of mines and other obstacles , the flotilla sailed downstream to Orșova near the Hungarian – Romanian border and waited for the lower Danube to be swept for mines . Commencing on 30 October 1915 , they escorted a series of munitions convoys down the Danube to Lom where the munitions were transferred to the Bulgarian railway system for shipment to the Ottoman Empire . 
 In November 1915 , Bodrog and the other monitors were assembled at Rustschuk , Bulgaria . The Central Powers were aware that the Romanians were negotiating to enter the war on the side of the Entente , so the flotilla established a sheltered base in the Belene Canal to protect the 480 @-@ kilometre ( 300 mi ) Danube border between Romania and Bulgaria . During 1915 , the 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns on the Bodrog were replaced with a single 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) L / 18 gun , and three machine guns were also fitted . 
 When the Romanians entered the war on 27 August 1916 , the monitors were again at Rustschuk , and were immediately attacked by three improvised torpedo boats operating out of the Romanian river port of Giurgiu . The torpedoes that were fired missed the monitors but struck a lighter loaded with fuel . Tasked with shelling Giurgiu the following day , the Second Monitor Division , consisting of Bodrog and three other monitors , set fire to oil storage tanks , the railway station and magazines , and sank several Romanian lighters . While the attack was underway , the First Monitor Division escorted supply ships back to the Belene anchorage . Bodrog and her companions then destroyed two Romanian patrol boats and an improvised minelayer on their way back to Belene . This was followed by forays of the Division both east and west of Belene , during which both Turnu Măgurele and Zimnicea were shelled . 
 On 2 October 1916 , Bodrog and Körös attacked a Romanian pontoon bridge being established across the Danube at Oryahovo , obtaining five direct hits , thus contributing to the defeat of the Romanian Flămânda Offensive . This was followed by action supporting the crossing of Generalfeldmarschall August von Mackensen 's Austro @-@ Hungarian Third Army at Sistow . Bodrog then wintered at Turnu Severin . 
 From 21 February 1917 , Bodrog and Körös were deployed as guardships at Brăila . On 1 March , Bodrog became stuck in ice at nearby <unk> . LSL Guido <unk> took command of Bodrog in 1918 . That year 's spring thaw saw Bodrog , Körös , Szamos , Bosna and several other vessels sent through the mouth of the Danube into the Black Sea as part of Flottenabteilung Wulff ( Fleet Division Wulff ) under the command of Flottenkapitän ( Fleet Captain ) Olav Wulff , arriving in Odessa on 12 April . On 15 July , she and Bosna sailed to the port of Nikolaev , and from 5 August , Bodrog was stationed at Cherson . On 12 September , she returned to Brăila along with other vessels . 
 Bodrog was sent to Reni near the mouth of the Danube to protect withdrawing Austro @-@ Hungarian troops , arriving there on 1 October . She then sailed upstream , reaching Rustschuk on 11 October , and Giurgiu two days later . On 14 October , she was deployed at Lom . She was the last Austro @-@ Hungarian monitor to withdraw towards Budapest and was the only one that failed to reach the city . On 31 October 1918 , Bodrog collided with a sand bank while navigating through heavy fog near Vinča . She was later captured by the Serbian Army . 
 = = = Interwar period and World War II = = = 
 From the Armistice to September 1919 , Bodrog was crewed by sailors of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> Srba , Hrvata i <unk> , KSCS ; later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ) . Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye , Bodrog was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels , including three other river monitors , but was not officially handed over to the KSCS Navy and renamed Sava until 15 April 1920 . Her sister ship Temes was transferred to Romania and renamed <unk> . In 1925 – 26 , Sava was refitted , but by the following year only two of the four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time . In 1932 , the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training , and few exercises or manoeuvres , due to reduced budgets . 
 Sava was based at Dubovac when the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941 . She was assigned to the 1st Monitor Division , and was responsible for the Romanian border on the Danube , under the operational control of the 3rd Infantry Division Dunavska . Her commander was Poručnik bojnog broda S. Rojos . 
 On that day , Sava and her fellow monitor Vardar fought off several attacks by individual Luftwaffe aircraft on their base . Over the next three days , the two monitors laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border . On 11 April , they were forced to withdraw from Dubovac towards Belgrade . During their withdrawal , they came under repeated attacks by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers . Sava and her fellow monitor were undamaged , and anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade at about 20 : 00 , where they were joined by the Morava . The three captains conferred , and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges , which meant there was insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely . The crews of the monitors were then transshipped to two tugboats , but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge , charges on the bridge accidentally exploded and the bridge fell onto the tugboat . Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel , 95 were killed . 
 After the scuttling of the monitors , around 450 officers and men from the Sava and various other riverine vessels gathered at Obrenovac . Armed only with personal weapons and some machine guns stripped from the scuttled vessels , the crews started towards the Bay of Kotor in the southern Adriatic in two groups . The smaller of the two groups reached its objective , but the larger group only made it as far as Sarajevo by 14 April before they were obliged to surrender . The remainder made their way to the Bay of Kotor , which was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April . 
 Sava was raised and repaired by the navy of the Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia , and served under that name alongside her fellow monitor Morava , which was raised , repaired , and renamed Bosna . Along with six captured motorboats and ten auxiliary vessels , they made up the riverine police force of the Croatian state . Sava was part of the 1st Patrol Group of the River Flotilla Command , headquartered at Zemun . Her crew scuttled her near Slavonski Brod on the night of 8 September 1944 and defected to the Yugoslav Partisans . 
 = = = Post @-@ war period = = = 
 Sava was again raised and refurbished after World War II . Armed with two single 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) gun turrets , three single 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) gun mounts and six 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) weapons , she served in the Yugoslav Navy from 1952 to 1962 . Afterwards , she was placed into the hands of a state @-@ owned company , which was privatised after the breakup of Yugoslavia . As of 2014 , Sava was serving as a gravel barge . In 2005 , the government of Serbia granted her limited heritage protection after citizens demanded that she be preserved as a floating museum , though little else has been done to restore her as of 2014 . The ship is one of only two surviving Austro @-@ Hungarian river monitors from World War I , the other being SMS Leitha , a much older monitor , which has been a museum ship anchored alongside the Hungarian Parliament Building in Budapest since 2014 .

 = Aiphanes = 
 Aiphanes is a genus of spiny palms which is native to tropical regions of South and Central America and the Caribbean . There are about 26 species in the genus ( see below ) , ranging in size from understorey shrubs with subterranean stems to subcanopy trees as tall as 20 metres ( 66 ft ) . Most have pinnately compound leaves ( leaves which are divided into leaflets arranged feather @-@ like , in pairs along a central axis ) ; one species has entire leaves . Stems , leaves and sometimes even the fruit are covered with spines . Plants flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan and have separate male and female flowers , although these are borne together on the same inflorescence . Although records of pollinators are limited , most species appear to be pollinated by insects . The fruit are eaten by several birds and mammals , including at least two species of amazon parrots . 
 Carl Ludwig Willdenow coined the name Aiphanes in 1801 . Before that , species belonging to the genus had been placed in Bactris or <unk> . The name Martinezia had also been applied to the genus , and between 1847 and 1932 it was generally used in place of Aiphanes . Max Burret resurrected the name Aiphanes in 1932 , and laid the basis for the modern concept of the genus . Aiphanes is most closely related to several other genera of spiny palms — Acrocomia , <unk> , Bactris and <unk> . Two species are widely planted as ornamentals and the fruit , seeds or palm heart of several species have been eaten by indigenous peoples of the Americas for millennia . 
 = = Description = = 
 Aiphanes is a genus of spiny palms ranging from 20 @-@ metre ( 66 ft ) tall subcanopy trees to small shrubs with subterranean stems growing in the forest understorey . Its name combines the Ancient Greek ai , meaning " always " , with <unk> , meaning " evident " , " visible " or " conspicuous " . In their 1996 monograph on the genus , botanists Finn Borchsenius and Rodrigo Bernal pointed out that " ironically , species of Aiphanes are generally very hard to spot and find in dense vegetation and , accordingly , are among the most poorly collected neotropical palms " . 
 = = = Stems = = = 
 While some species are single @-@ stemmed , others form multi @-@ stemmed ( caespitose ) clumps . Coupled with variation in stem size , this produces a diversity of growth forms in the genus — solitary ( single @-@ stemmed ) palms that grow into the subcanopy of the forest , solitary or caespitose palms that grow in the forest understorey and acaulescent palms which lack an aboveground stem . 
 Two species are characterised by an acaulescent growth habit — A. acaulis and A. spicata . Two other species — A. <unk> and A. <unk> — occur in both acaulescent populations and those which produce above @-@ ground stems . Several species are single @-@ stemmed understorey palms , an unusual growth form . Aiphanes grandis and A. minima are single @-@ stemmed palms which grow to be more than 10 metres ( 33 ft ) tall , while the remainder are multi @-@ stemmed understorey species . Multi @-@ stemmed palms range from plants with a single main stem and a few basal suckers to caespitose clumps of 20 densely packed stems . A variety of growth forms can exist within a single species and this appears to be influenced by habitat and environmental conditions . 
 = = = Leaves = = = 
 The leaves of Aiphanes species are usually pinnately divided — rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather @-@ like or fern @-@ like pattern . The sole exception to this is A. macroloba which has entire leaves . They are usually spirally arranged , but some species have a <unk> leaf arrangement , a condition that is normal in palm seedlings but uncommon among adults . Old leaf bases detach cleanly from the stem , except in A. hirsuta subsp. <unk> , which often has old leaf bases attached to the newer portions of the stem . 
 Leaves are spiny but the degree varies both within and among species . Leaf sheaths are always densely spiny but the spines usually become smaller and sparser towards the ends of the leaves . 
 = = = Spines = = = 
 Spines are characteristic of Aiphanes and other members of the subtribe <unk> . They are found almost everywhere on the plants and are especially well @-@ developed on the stem , leaf bases , and the peduncle . In Aiphanes , the spines are formed from the outer tissues of the plant and are not derived through the modification of other plant organs . They range from less than 1 millimetre ( 0 @.@ 04 in ) to more than 25 centimetres ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) long . 
 = = = Flowers = = = 
 Aiphanes species are <unk> — they flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan — and monoecious , meaning that there are separate male and female flowers , but individuals plants bear both types of flowers . In Aiphanes , male and female flowers are borne together on the same inflorescence . Usually only a single inflorescence is borne at each node , although A. gelatinosa often bears then in groups of three at a single node . The inflorescence usually consists of a main axis consisting of a peduncle and a rachis . The rachis bears <unk> , which are smaller branches which themselves bear the flowers , while the peduncle is the main stalk connecting the rachis with the stem of the plant . In some species there is second @-@ order branching — the <unk> themselves are branched and the flowers are borne on these branches . 
 Flowers are usually borne in groups of three — one female flower together with two male flowers . In some species groups of four flowers ( two male and two female ) have been reported . At the far end of the inflorescence , away from the axis of the tree , pairs of male flowers replace the triads of male and female flowers . Flower colour is poorly known . It must be recorded from live plants , since preserved flowers lose their colour over time , and records of these species in the wild are incomplete . Male flowers tend to fall into two groups — those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers . Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers . 
 Pollen grains are usually spherical to ellipsoid in shape , sometimes triangular , about 20 to 30 micrometres along their long axis and 20 to 30 µm in diameter . They are typically monosulcate , <unk> or more rarely <unk> . The sulcus is a furrow which runs along the surface of the pollen grain and is usually the site at which pollination occurs . <unk> pollen has a single furrow that runs along the pole of the pollen grain . <unk> pollen have a furrow that runs along the equator of the pollen grain . <unk> pollen , on the other hand , has three furrows . The outer layer of the pollen is covered to a greater or lesser extent with ridges , spines or warts . This " sculpting " tends to be more pronounced in species that are fly @-@ pollinated and less pronounced in those that are pollinated by beetles or bees . 
 = = = Fruit = = = 
 The fruit of Aiphanes species is usually a red , spherical , single @-@ seeded drupe . A thin skin ( or <unk> ) , which can be either smooth or spiny , covers the fleshy mesocarp , which is typically orange and sweet . The mesocarp of A. horrida has one of the highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein . The <unk> , which encases the seed , is brown or black and very hard at maturity . Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat ( or testa ) and white endosperm , which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut . 
 = = = Karyotype = = = 
 Published chromosome counts exist for two species , Aiphanes minima and A. horrida ; haploid chromosome counts vary from 15 to 18 . Borchsenius and Bernal report that it is difficult to get accurate chromosome counts in palms and that differences in chromosome counts may reflect these difficulties .

 Aiphanes is placed in the subfamily Arecoideae , the tribe <unk> and the subtribe <unk> , together with the genera <unk> , Bactris , Acrocomia and <unk> . 
 In his 1932 revision of the genus , German botanist Max Burret recognised 32 species . Seventeen of these were new species , mostly based on collections made by German botanist Wilhelm <unk> in northern Colombia between 1877 and 1881 . Working with a very narrow species concept , and not being familiar with the variation present in natural populations , Burret placed almost every specimen into a distinct species . The bombing of the Berlin Herbarium during the Second World War destroyed the only known collections for 13 of these 32 species , further complicating the situation . 
 The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature requires each species to be represented by a type collection . The destruction of Burret 's type collections left many species only known from his original descriptions , which generally lacked illustrations . Other specimens ( called <unk> ) were designated to replace these , either by Rodrigo Bernal and colleagues in 1989 or by Borchsenius and Bernal in their 1996 monograph of the genus . Bernal and colleagues attempted to retrace <unk> 's travels in northern Colombia and collect specimens from as close as possible to the location of the original collections . 
 Burret divided Aiphanes into two subgenera , Brachyanthera and Macroanthera . Eleven species were placed in Macroanthera , while the remainder were placed in Brachyanthera . In their 1996 monograph , Borchsenius and Bernal questioned the applicability of these subgenera . They recognised that if Macroanthera was reduced to three species ( A. horrida , A. eggersii and A. minima ) it could form a viable grouping , but that this would leave Brachyanthera overly heterogeneous . Consequently , they abandoned Burret 's use of subgenera . 
 In the three decades following Burret 's delimitation of the genus a further 15 species were described , bringing the total species count to 47 . Borchsenius and Bernal determined that many of these names were synonyms , although American botanist George Proctor disagreed with their decision to lump A. <unk> into A. minima . Borchsenius and Bernal also described one new species , Aiphanes spicata , bringing the total number of accepted species to 22 . In two cases the destruction of the only known collections made it impossible to be absolutely certain that a name was a synonym . The current World Checklist of Selected Plant Families , maintained by <unk> <unk> at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , recognises 26 species , including four species described since the publication of Borchsenius and Bernal 's monograph .

 = = = History = = = 
 The earliest botanical description of a species in the genus was made by French botanist Charles Plumier , who described two species based on his visits to the West Indies between 1689 and 1695 . Both of Plumier 's species are now considered to be Aiphanes minima . The same species was described by Dutch botanist Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1763 . Spanish botanist José Celestino Mutis produced a detailed description of A. lindeniana and illustrations of that species and what is thought to be A. horrida in 1779 . 
 In 1791 Joseph Gaertner included a species of Aiphanes in his De <unk> et <unk> Plantarum , calling it Bactris minima . This is the oldest validly published name for any member of the genus . The name Aiphanes was coined by German botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1801 . He described a single species , A. aculeata , in 1806 . 
 Jacquin had used the name <unk> horrida to describe a plant that belonged to the same species ( and may have been the same individual ) described by Willdenow . Borchsenius and Bernal cite an 1809 publication date for Jacquin 's description , which gave precedence to Willdenow 's name . However , the more recent World Checklist ( 2006 ) gives an 1801 publication date for Jacquin 's description , making A. horrida the correct name for the species . 
 In 1816 Alexander von Humboldt , Aimé Bonpland and Carl Sigismund Kunth described Martinezia <unk> , adding another name to the list of synonyms for A. horrida . Since the original diagnostic characters of Martinezia did not fit any existent species , it was redefined by Kunth to fit M. <unk> . Consequently , Martinezia came to replace Aiphanes and the latter name was rarely used between 1847 and 1932 . In 1857 Hermann Karsten created a new genus , <unk> , to accommodate two Colombian species , M. <unk> ( later shown to be a synonym for A. horrida ) and M. erinacea ( now A. erinacea ) . Hermann Wendland attempted to resurrect Aiphanes in 1878 , merging Martinezia and <unk> into it , but his proposal was ignored . In 1901 Orator F. Cook created two new genera — <unk> , into which he put A. minima , and <unk> , which housed A. horrida . In 1932 , after publishing a species in Martinezia , Burret changed his mind about the genus and synonymised it with Aiphanes . This led to the current delimitation of the genus .

 Species accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families : 
 = = Distribution and status = = 
 The genus Aiphanes ranges from the Dominican Republic and Panama in the north , to Trinidad and Tobago in the east , across Colombia and down along the Andes to Bolivia . In Brazil it only occurs along the border with Peru . Aiphanes is primarily South American — one species ( A. hirsuta ) is present in Panama and two others ( A. horrida and A. minima ) are found in the Caribbean . Aiphanes minima , which is endemic to the insular Caribbean , is the only species absent from the South American mainland . Although A. horrida has been reported from Guyana and southern Venezuela these reports have not been verified with herbarium vouchers . 
 Aiphanes horrida is the most widely distributed species . It ranges from Trinidad to Bolivia but is absent from Ecuador and northern Peru . Other species have narrower ranges with one centre of diversity in western Colombia and Ecuador and another minor one in northeastern Peru . The 2006 IUCN Red List includes three species which are endangered by habitat destruction — A. grandis , A. <unk> and A verrucosa — and three others considered vulnerable to the same threat — A. <unk> , A. <unk> and A. lindeniana . Rodrigo Bernal and Gloria Galeano expanded this list in a 2005 review of the status of Colombian palms . They listed two species as critically endangered — A. <unk> , a species that was first described in 2002 , and A. <unk> ( which was classified as endangered in the IUCN Red List ) . They classified two species as endangered — A. acaulis and A. <unk> — and two species as vulnerable — A. gelatinosa and A. pilaris . They also classified six species as near threatened — A. erinacea , A. hirsuta , A. lindeniana ( vulnerable according to the IUCN Red List ) , A. linearis , A. macroloba and A. simplex . The threats to these species were not listed , but Jens @-@ Christian <unk> reported that A. erinacea was threatened by logging given its limited distribution and poor ability to regenerate in disturbed forests . In addition to these , A. <unk> , which is widely distributed across the western Amazon Rainforest , is present at such low densities that it was classified as a rare species by Francis Kahn and <unk> Moussa in 1994 . 
 = = Habitat and ecology = = 
 Aiphanes species are palms of the forest understorey and subcanopy . The most widely distributed species , A. horrida , occurs both in tropical dry forest and in more humid forest types , but there is a gap in its distribution which coincides with the wettest forests of the upper Amazon Basin . Two other species , A. minima and A. eggersii , are also found in drier environments ; A. eggersii is found in areas receiving as little as 500 mm ( 20 in ) of precipitation annually . The remaining species are found in montane forests at high elevations or in wet — often very wet — lowland forests , including areas receiving as much as 9 @,@ 000 mm ( 350 in ) of annual precipitation . 
 Records of visits by pollinators exist for only a few species , but most of these suggest that the species are pollinated by insects . Flowers of A. <unk> produce small quantities of nectar , but lack a scent . Fruit flies ( Drosophilidae ) , fungus gnats ( Mycetophilidae , <unk> ) , midges ( <unk> , Ceratopogonidae ) and <unk> ( Lepidoptera ) were recorded visiting these flowers , but bees and hover flies were not . Aiphanes eggersii was thought to be pollinated by bees and possibly by wind . Fruit flies ( Drosophilidae ) , hover flies ( <unk> ) , biting midges ( Ceratopogonidae ) and leaf beetles ( Chrysomelidae ) were recorded visiting the flowers of A. erinacea , but bees were not . Aiphanes horrida was <unk> pollinated by wind , bees ( <unk> ) , weevils ( Curculionidae ) and bugs ( Hemiptera ) . Flies and weevils were observed on the flowers of A. simplex . 
 The fruit of A. horrida is rich in vitamins and energy and likely to be eaten by many animals . <unk> are reported to eat its fruit and disperse its seeds . Squirrels are also reported to consume the fruit , despite the spiny nature of the tree . The fruit , flowers and seeds of A. minima are consumed by the vulnerable Saint Vincent amazon ( Amazona <unk> ) and is also considered a potentially important food species for the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon ( Amazona vittata ) . 
 Several species show clumped distributions . Dispersal limitation has been invoked to explain the clumped distribution of adults and limited recruitment of seedlings in both A. erinacea in Ecuador and A. minima in Puerto Rico . Similarly , the rarity of A. lindeniana and A. simplex in Colombian forests may be linked to limited seed production and the limited effectiveness of seed dispersal by avian and mammalian frugivores . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Aiphanes species have a long history of human use . The remains of <unk> seeds thought to belong to A. horrida have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to about 2800 BP ; seeds of this species are still consumed and are traded in local markets . Aiphanes horrida is also widely planted as an ornamental , as is A. minima . The fruit or seeds of A. <unk> , A. eggersii , A. linearis and A. minima are all consumed locally . The palm heart of A. macroloba is consumed by the <unk> people of northwestern South America . <unk> , a compound isolated from A. horrida , has shown significant inhibitory activity against <unk> ; inhibition of these enzymes can provide relief from the symptoms of inflammation and pain .

 " The Hungry Earth " is the eighth episode in the fifth series of British science fiction television series Doctor Who , which was first broadcast on 22 May 2010 on BBC One . It was written by Chris Chibnall , who had previously written for Doctor Who and its spin @-@ off series , Torchwood . It is the first episode of a two @-@ part story , the second episode being " Cold Blood " , and features the return of the Silurians , a reptile @-@ like humanoid race last seen in 1984 's Warriors of the Deep . 
 In the episode , the Doctor — a time travelling alien played by Matt Smith — and his companions Amy Pond ( Karen Gillan ) and Rory Williams ( Arthur Darvill ) land in Wales in 2020 , where a drilling operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry ( Meera Syal ) is drilling deep into the earth and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth . The Silurians cause holes to open in the earth , one of which consumes Amy . The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian , Alaya ( Neve McIntosh ) , and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya , as it could spark a war . He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy . 
 Executive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger contacted Chibnall and asked him to write a two @-@ part episode involving Silurians and a drill . Moffat wished to redesign the Silurians and worked together with Chibnall to create the idea of distinguishing prosthetics for their faces . Being in the fourth production block of the series , the episode was filmed in October and November 2009 , with location filming in Llanwynno , Wales . McIntosh then returned in the series as a recurrent actress , portraying Madame Vastra , another Silurian character . The episode was watched by 6 @.@ 49 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD and received mixed reviews from critics . While some praised the horror , some noted that the story was very simplistic , and critics disagreed about the redesigned Silurians . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Doctor , Amy and Rory land in the small Welsh village of <unk> in 2020 instead of their intended destination , Rio de Janeiro . They encounter a mining operation led by Doctor Nasreen Chaudhry , who is studying minerals deep in the earth that have not been seen for over 20 million years . Nasreen is assisted by a local , Tony Mack , whose daughter and grandson , Ambrose and Elliot , are investigating the disappearance of bodies at the nearby church graveyard . An earth tremor causes the ground to open and sends Tony and Amy falling into it ; Tony is rescued but Amy is pulled under by unknown forces . The Doctor surmises that the minerals form a bio @-@ reactive defence system triggered by the drilling operation . The group is soon alerted to the presence of three life forms travelling up the drilling shaft from 21 kilometres ( 13 miles ) below the earth , and they barricade themselves in the church . The Doctor explains Amy 's disappearance to Rory and assures him he will get her back . 
 The three beings are discovered to be reptilian humanoids , and in a scuffle , they capture Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue ; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth . The Doctor realises the beings are a new form of Silurians , and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage . The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya ; she is a member of the warrior caste , awoken by the drill . Alaya believes , as do all Silurians , that the Earth still belongs to them , that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans , and that they will defeat humanity eventually . Tony , suffering from the effects of the venom , says they should dissect Alaya , but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as an act of war . The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce ; Nasreen accompanies him . 
 Amy awakens to find herself strapped to an examining table , near to where Ambrose 's husband Mo is also ensnared . Mo explains that the Silurians intended to <unk> her , as they have vivisected him — awake . The Doctor and Nasreen arrive underground in the TARDIS ; the Doctor explains about the Silurians and says that he expects to encounter only a few of the creatures . The show ends on a cliffhanger as the Doctor and Nasreen behold an immense Silurian civilisation in the caverns below the earth .

 Steven Moffat contacted Chris Chibnall , asking him to return to writing for Doctor Who . Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episode " 42 " as well as episodes of the spin @-@ off series Torchwood . Moffat and executive producer Piers Wenger gave him the brief of Silurians , a drill , and that it was a two @-@ parter . The Silurians were villains who had previously appeared in the 1970 serial Doctor Who and the Silurians and the 1984 serial Warriors of the Deep . For research , Chibnall read the original novel Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters and watched the original serial , noting the freedom writer Malcolm Hulke took with the novel in things he could not have done in the television format . Chibnall wanted there to be a large Silurian city in contrast to the small human village on the surface . Knowing that the Silurians were not as popular and recurring as other villains , Moffat instructed Chibnall to bring the creatures to a new audience , and Chibnall decided to start out with knowing nothing about them and then introducing them in " the most exciting and scary way possible for people who 've never seen them before " . Chibnall also considered bringing back the Silurians ' amphibious cousins the Sea Devils , but decided that doing two races of monster was much tougher and the story was " so clearly about the Silurians and what the Silurians want " . 
 Chibnall , having enjoyed when the Doctor and his companion were separated , made the decision for Amy to be absent for most of the episode . Moffat also thought that , at the point in the middle of the series , it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people . A deleted scene , parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind @-@ the @-@ scenes show Doctor Who Confidential , was filmed , depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future , and if that would really happen . 
 With the absence of Amy , Chibnall thought that Nasreen became a " de facto companion " . Meera Syal , who was cast as Nasreen , had been a fan of the series since childhood and had been trying to secure a role in the show since its revival in 2005 and was pleased when she received it . Syal described her character as " a very high @-@ up , innovative geologist " who became good friends with the Doctor as the two admired each other 's passion . 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 Moffat wanted the Silurians to be redesigned and without their former third eye , as Davros also had a third eye and he wanted the Silurians to be " completely different " . They were intended to be a different branch of the same species , and so the original Silurians still existed . Chibnall wrote for the redesigned Silurians to be beautiful and it was intended for the redesign to capture the actors ' features and allow them to give stronger performances and differentiate themselves . Chibnall believed that it complemented the theme in the two @-@ parter about how the humans and Silurians were alike and different . Due to the expensive prosthetics needed , extra Silurians wore face masks which prevented the need for every actor portraying a Silurian to receive the facial prosthetics . Chibnall also incorporated a poisonous tongue into the new branch of Silurians . 
 " The Hungry Earth " and the second part , " Cold Blood " made up the fourth production block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno , Wales . In an interview , Syal stated that they did the location filming first . The drill itself was automatic and done by computer . For the scene in which Amy is dragged underneath the ground , Gillan stood on boxes and lowered herself into a stone compartment . Two pieces of rubber were at the opening of the compartment which expanded as she lowered herself down . A layer of soil was spread across the rubber ; Gillan 's ears were taped over to make sure the soil did not enter her ears . Gillan , initially scared at performing the stunt , put some of her fear and claustrophobia into the scene as she expected Amy felt the same way .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The episode received mixed reviews from critics . Dan Martin , writing for The Guardian , said that the episode set up an " interesting quandary " but , although many elements were introduced , " not a lot actually seems to happen " . He was also critical of the family members and found he did not care about any of them besides Elliot and Nasreen , and although the scene in which Amy was pulled into the ground was " effective and poignant " , it left a lack of " Pond @-@ life " in the rest of the episode . However , he did commend the prosthetics department for their redesigned Silurians . Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph was pleased that it " didn 't disappoint " him . He praised the choice to show the Doctor 's pacifism and Amy 's few but memorable " nightmarish " scenes . However , he was not favourable to Meera Syal 's performance and considered the Silurian 's redesign too " radical and divorced " from their original appearance , most notably the absence of their third eye . 
 Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave the episode a positive review , saying that it felt " like proper , classic Doctor Who " in terms of " gripping storytelling , terrific pace , spooky direction , a grand idea ... a small @-@ scale Earth setting in the near future , characters worth caring about ... plenty of meat for the three leads " and " a companion in real peril " . He particularly praised the performances of Syal and Smith . He also enjoyed the Silurian 's redesign , saying that the old one " would ... look ridiculous today " . Though he " missed " the old voice from Peter Halliday , he said he adjusted to Neve McIntosh . AOL TV reviewer Brad Trechak was positive towards the comparisons that could be made between conflicts throughout history to the human @-@ Silurian conflict , but called the episode a " wasted opportunity " . He felt that it was " more suspense and adventure than horror " , wishing that it was scarier , and also commented that it was " very simplistic " and did not re @-@ introduce the Silurians as well as it would have , had they been part of the overall storyline . 
 IGN 's Matt Wales rated the episode 8 out of 10 , assessing it as a " slender but satisfying success " . He said that the narrative was " simplistic " without much depth , but that the " strong supporting cast " and " sympathetic characters " made it a " refreshingly involving tale " . He also praised Smith 's Doctor , who " delivered admirably " and carried out the show with the absence of Amy . Ian Berriman for SFX magazine gave the episode three out of five stars , mainly displeased with the redesign of the Silurians , although he was positive toward their " venomous tongue lash " and costume . He also criticised the " clunky " scripting and questioned some technical aspects . However , he praised the scene of Amy being dragged into the earth , as well as Alaya 's hunt for Elliot in the graveyard and the interaction between the Doctor and Elliot .

 Racha ( English : Sensational ) , also spelt <unk> , is a 2012 Indian Telugu @-@ language action film directed by Sampath Nandi and co @-@ written by the Paruchuri Brothers . Produced by R. B. Choudary in association with N. V. Prasad and Paras Jain under their banner <unk> Super Good Films , it features Ram Charan and Tamannaah in the lead roles , with Mukesh Rishi , Dev Gill and Kota Srinivasa Rao playing the antagonists . The film marks the Telugu debut of Ajmal Ameer and R. Parthiepan who makes a crucial cameo appearance . 
 The film focuses on the attempts made by a gambler Raj to make Chaitra , a medical student , fall in love with him as a part of a bet where he is challenged by his rival James . Raj accepts the challenge to meet the expenses of his adopted father 's liver transplantation but later discovers that he has been trapped by James and Chaitra for a purpose . 
 The film was edited by Gautham Raju ; Sameer Reddy provided the cinematography ; Mani Sharma composed the film 's score and soundtrack . Made on a budget of ₹ 320 million , the Principal photography commenced in June 2011 and was shot in various locations throughout Asia , mainly in Telangana , Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu of India apart from Sri Lanka and Bangkok . The film was also shot in the Anji County of China making it the first Telugu film to do so . 
 The film was released worldwide on 5 April 2012 to mixed reviews from critics . However , the film collected a share of ₹ 450 million in its lifetime at the global box office and became one of the highest grossing Telugu films of the year . The film received four nominations at the 60th Filmfare Awards South where it won the award for best choreography . It also received five nominations at 2nd South Indian International Movie Awards but did not win any . 
 Racha was dubbed into Tamil as Ragalai and into Malayalam as Raksha . The former was released on 6 April 2012 while the latter was released a week later . Both the dubbed versions were commercially successful . The film was dubbed into Hindi as Betting Raja in 2014 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Raj ( Ram Charan ) is a Hyderabad @-@ based gambler living with his adopted parents who supports his means of living . Tragedy strikes the family when his adopted father ( M. S. Narayana ) is diagnosed with cirrhosis as a result of alcoholism . Raj needs ₹ 2 million for his father 's liver transplantation , which must be done within a month . As he is on the lookout for money , he is approached by James ( Ajmal Ameer ) , his rival in betting , with a betting challenge . James dares Raju to make Chaitra ( Tamannaah ) , a dental student and the daughter of a dreaded and influential businessman Bellary ( Mukesh Rishi ) to fall in love with him . If he is able to complete the task before 31 December 2011 , James will give him the money needed for his father 's operation and if not , he has to give up betting forever . 
 Desperate for the money , Raj takes up the challenge and begins wooing Chaitra . Initially , she appears to spurn his advances and sets him even tougher challenges to propose her . Raj successfully overcomes all these challenges and Chaitra soon reciprocates his advances . Bellary finds out about their relationship and sends his henchmen to kill the couple on the night of 31 December . Raj and Chaitra successfully dodge the henchmen and escape to Srisailam . Bellary , with the help of his corrupt minister @-@ friend Baireddanna ( Kota Srinivasa Rao ) and the latter 's Dubai @-@ based son ( Dev Gill ) , begins a search for them . At Srisailam , James rescues the couple from Bellary 's henchmen but gets stabbed by Baireddanna 's son who also kidnaps Chaitra . An injured James then reveals about Raj 's past . 
 Raj 's father Suryanarayana ( R. Parthiepan ) was a respected man in <unk> and his best friend , a rich man named Ramamurthy ( Nassar ) , was Chaitra 's father . Chaitra and Raj were childhood friends . Bellary , who is Ramamurthy 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , found out about the presence of iron ore under Ramamurthy 's land and along with Baireddanna , decided to exploit the ore for their own benefit . When Suryanarayana and Ramamurthy objected , they and their families , except Raj and Chaitra , were killed by Bellary and Baireddanna . Chaitra was adopted by Bellary who planned to kill her when she becomes an adult so that he could acquire Ramamurthy 's land . Chaitra , who was aware about Raj 's love for making bets , told her childhood friend James to trap Raj by placing the bet ( which took place earlier in the movie ) so that Bellary and Baireddanna can be destroyed using him . Raj decides to avenge his father 's death and kills Bellary , Baireddanna and his son at <unk> . He rescues Chaitra and distributes Ramamurthy 's land to the villagers after marrying her .

There was no proper script except a vague one @-@ line for the film then and a song was shot on Charan . After the release of Orange ( 2010 ) , Charan and the producers asked Dharani to come up with its bound script . He narrated it to both Charan and his father Chiranjeevi . When Dharani quoted a high budget , Chiranjeevi and the producers suggested a reduction . 
 After completing a schedule , <unk> was shelved and later , N. V. Prasad approved a script narrated by Sampath Nandi and announced in late February 2011 . The film 's official launch ceremony was conducted on 12 June 2011 at Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad where the film 's working title was announced as Racha . Mani Sharma was signed to compose the film 's music . Sameer Reddy was recruited as the film 's cinematographer while Raju Sundaram and Shobi choreographed the songs along with Prem Rakshith . The film 's Telugu logo was unveiled on 14 February 2012 and the title was confirmed as Racha where the first two letters were taken from Ram and the other three letters were taken from Charan . The first look poster featuring Charan was unveiled on 18 February 2012 .

 Charan left for an abroad trip for a complete make @-@ over of his attire and practised different dancing steps as part of his homework for the film . He also underwent training in strict physical exercise for about 45 days in David Barton 's gym . Reports in early March 2011 suggested that Tamannaah would be signed in as the female lead , who was finalised for the same in mid May 2011 . She was confirmed to play the role of a rich woman who falls in love with a poor man . She later revealed in an interview that her character is integral to the film 's main plot and its layers get revealed as the film progresses . 
 R. Parthiepan made a cameo appearance as Charan 's father in the film marking his Telugu debut who accepted it after Nandi explained the role 's importance . Ajmal Ameer 's inclusion in the film 's cast was confirmed in late July 2011 . He revealed later that every character in the film would be introduced through his role which would be a cameo appearance , adding that it would be an impactful one bringing twists in the story . He could not dub for his role since he was shooting for a Tamil film in France . Brahmanandam and Krishna <unk> were included in the film 's cast in early October 2011 . Dev Gill was signed to play one of the antagonists . He revealed that all his action sequences will be with Charan only . Lisa Haydon performed an item number in the film .

 Principal photography commenced in June 2011 at Hyderabad . The next schedule began at Sri Lanka in early July 2011 . Tamannaah joined the film 's sets on 7 July 2011 and she revealed that the film would be shot in the jungles of Sri Lanka in a long schedule . A song featuring Charan and Tamannaah was shot in Sri Lanka in late July 2011 on whose completion the schedule was wrapped up . Filming continued at Bangkok till 15 August 2011 . Later , a dance academy set was erected in the outskirts of Hyderabad where few comedy scenes were shot . 
 Few scenes were shot in a set erected near the Aluminium factory at Gachibowli . Tamannaah and Brahmanandam participated in the film 's shoot at Hyderabad till 6 October 2011 after which the makers planned to shoot the film in China . After much silent shoot in Hyderabad , filming continued at Goa . During the shoot of Charan 's introduction scene , the cables fixed to the train failed and Charan , who was sitting in a car on the railway track , jumped from the car and was injured . After the schedule 's completion , Charan visited Sabarimala to end his <unk> <unk> . 
 The song Vaana Vaana <unk> was shot on Charan and Tamannaah in early November 2011 . A special set in Annapurna Studios was erected where the song was shot for four days after which the film 's China schedule commenced from 12 November 2011 . A song and a fight sequence was shot at a Bamboo forest in Anji County of Zhejiang province till the end of November 2011 . Racha became the first Telugu film to be shot in the dense forest of interior China . On its completion , Charan took a break for ten days . The film 's shoot resumed at <unk> near Tirupathi in December 2011 . After a brief shoot at Ramoji Film City , the last schedule began in Chennai on 17 January 2012 . The shooting of the title song choreographed by Prem Rakshith was wrapped up at Buddha Statue of Hyderabad on 23 January 2012 . 
 The film 's shoot continued at Periyar National Park of Kerala in February 2012 . Charan and Tamannaah were filming for a song sequence on a boat when the park 's deputy director Sanjay Kumar insisted that the duo should use life jackets as they were entering a risky spot . After few disagreements , the film 's shoot was temporarily halted and some long shots were shot when the duo used the jackets . The forest officials also restricted the entry of about 20 vehicles and 100 members into the park due to which the shoot was limited to a small portion of a song . 
 After spraining his leg during the song shoot at Annapurna Studios , Charan was advised to take a bed rest for three to four weeks . He rejoined the shoot on 25 March 2012 to complete the remaining two songs . After completing the shoot for the song <unk> <unk> at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad , the last song <unk> was shot at Anaimalai Hills and <unk> Waterfalls near Pollachi on Charan and Tamannaah . On its completion , the film 's team returned to Hyderabad and the principal photography came to an end on 1 April 2012 .

 = Brumby = 
 A Brumby is a free @-@ roaming feral horse in Australia . Although found in many areas around the country , the best @-@ known Brumbies are found in the Australian Alps region in south @-@ eastern Australia . Today , most of them are found in the Northern Territory , with the second largest population in Queensland . A group of Brumbies is known as a " mob " or " band " . 
 Brumbies are the descendants of escaped or lost horses , dating back in some cases to those belonging to the early European settlers , including the " Capers " from South Africa , Timor Ponies from Indonesia , British pony and draught horse breeds , and a significant number of Thoroughbreds and Arabians . 
 Today they live in many places , including some National Parks . Occasionally they are mustered and domesticated for use as <unk> , working stock horses on farms or stations , but also as trail horses , show horses , Pony Club mounts and pleasure horses . They are the subject of some controversy – regarded as a pest and threat to native ecosystems by environmentalists and the government , but also valued by others as part of Australia 's heritage , with supporters working to prevent inhumane treatment or extermination , and <unk> Brumbies who have been captured . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origin of the term = = = 
 The term Brumby refers to a feral horse in Australia . Its first recorded use in print is in the Australasian magazine from Melbourne in 1880 , which said that Brumbies were the bush name in Queensland for ' wild ' horses . In 1885 , the Once a Month magazine suggested that <unk> was a New South Wales term , and the poet Banjo Paterson stated in the introduction for his poem Brumby 's Run published in the Bulletin in 1894 that Brumby was the word for free @-@ roaming horses . Its derivation is obscure , and may have come about from one or more of the following possibilities : 
 Horses left behind by Sergeant James Brumby from his property at Mulgrave Place in New South Wales , when he left for Tasmania in 1804 . 
 An Aboriginal word <unk> meaning " wild " in the language of the <unk> Indigenous Australians on the Warrego and Nogoa Rivers in southern Queensland . 
 A letter in 1896 to the Sydney Morning Herald says that <unk> is the word for horse among the Aboriginal people of the <unk> , <unk> , Warrego and <unk> Rivers . 
 <unk> , which was the name of a creek and station in the Queensland district of Burnett , established in the 1840s and later abandoned , leaving many of the horses to escape into the wild . 
 It has also been suggested that the name derives from the Irish word <unk> or <unk> . 
 = = = Early horse imports = = = 
 Horses first arrived in Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet . They were imported for farm and utility work ; recreational riding and racing were not major activities . By 1800 , only about 200 horses are thought to have reached Australia . Horse racing became popular around 1810 , resulting in an influx of Thoroughbred imports , mostly from England . Roughly 3 @,@ 500 horses were living in Australia by 1820 , and this number had grown to 160 @,@ 000 by 1850 , largely due to natural increase . The long journey by sea from England , Europe , and Asia meant that only the strongest horses survived the trip , making for a particularly healthy and strong Australian stock , which aided in their ability to flourish . 
 = = = Origin of feral herds = = = 
 Horses were likely confined primarily to the Sydney region until the early 19th century , when settlers first crossed the Blue Mountains and opened expansion inland . Horses were required for travel , and for cattle and sheep droving as the pastoral industry grew . The first report of an escaped horse is in 1804 , and by the 1840s some horses had escaped from settled regions of Australia . It is likely that some escaped because fences were not properly installed , when fences existed at all , but it is believed that most Australian horses became feral because they were released into the wild and left to fend for themselves . This may have been the result of pastoralists abandoning their settlements , and thus their horses , due to the arid conditions and unfamiliar land that combined to make farming in Australia especially difficult . After World War I , the demand for horses by defence forces declined with the growth in mechanization , which led to a growth in the number of unwanted animals that were often set free . Throughout the 20th century , the replacement of horses with machines in farming led to further falls in demand , and therefore may have also contributed to increases in feral populations . 
 Currently , Australia has at least 400 @,@ 000 horses roaming the continent . It is also estimated that , during non @-@ drought periods , the feral horse population increases at a rate of 20 percent per year . Drought conditions and <unk> are natural threats . Despite population numbers , feral horses are generally considered to be a moderate pest . Where they are allowed to damage vegetation and cause erosion , the impact on the environment can be detrimental , and for that reason can be considered a serious environmental threat . However , because they also have cultural and potential economic value , the management of Brumbies presents a complex issue . 
 Brumbies roaming in the Australian Alps of south @-@ eastern Australia are thought to be descendants of horses which were owned by the pastoralist and pioneer , Benjamin Boyd . 
 = = = Pangaré Brumbies = = = 
 On the coast south of Geraldton , Western Australia the Brumbies there are known as ‘ <unk> Ponies ’ , as they appear to carry the rare Pangaré gene . This colouring is commonly known as mealy and is seen mainly in a number of old breeds such as British Ponies , Timor Ponies , Haflingers and even Belgian Draught Horses . The gene causes lightening in parts of a horse ’ s coat , resulting in a mealy coloured muzzle , forearms , flanks , and the belly . It is sometimes seen in chestnut horses with flaxen coloured manes and tails . 
 The Pangaré Brumbies appear have adapted well to their coastal environment , where they are consuming saltbush , which they do not appear to be damaging . The Department of Environment and Conservation and the Outback Heritage Horse Association of Western Australia ( <unk> ) are monitoring these particular Brumbies to ensure the careful management of these unusual feral horses . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Brumbies have been captured , fitted with GPS tracking collars , and used in extensive comparative research into the effect of terrain on the morphology and health of different horses ’ hooves . They have their paths of movement , diet , watering patterns , and mob structure tracked and recorded . 
 Captured Brumbies can be trained as stock horses and other saddle horses . Encouraging viewing of feral herds may also have potential as a tourist attraction . Brumbies are sometimes sold into the European horse meat market after their capture , and contribute millions of dollars to the Australian economy . Approximately 30 % of horses for meat export originates from the feral population . The hides and hair of these horses are also used and sold . 
 Wild Brumbies are used in Brumby training camps by organisations that promote positive interaction between troubled , high @-@ risk youths . These camps usually last several weeks , allowing youths to train a wild Brumby to become a quiet , willing saddle horse while improving the youths ’ self @-@ esteem . 
 Wild Brumbies are also used in the Brumby catch and handle event in stockman ’ s challenge competitions , where riders are required to catch a free running Brumby from their horse within a time limit of a few minutes . Sectional points are awarded for the stockman ’ s challenge for care and skill in catching the Brumby and their ability to teach them to lead . These demanding challenges for riders are held in New South Wales at Dalgety , Tamworth and <unk> plus The Man From Snowy River Challenge in Corryong , Victoria . Several New South Wales show societies , including Walcha , Bellingen and Dorrigo hold special classes for registered Brumbies at their annual agricultural shows . 
 = = Environmental impact = = 
 Horses were first described as pests in Australia in the 1860s . Their environmental impact may include soil loss , compaction , and erosion ; trampling of vegetation ; reduction in the vastness of plants ; increased tree deaths by chewing on bark ; damage to bog habitats and waterholes ; spreading of invasive weeds ; and various detrimental effects on population of native species . In some cases , when feral horses are startled , they may damage infrastructure , including troughs , pipes , and fences . However , Brumbies are also credited for help keeping tracks and trails clear for bush walkers and service vehicles in some areas . 
 In some habitats , hooves of free @-@ roaming horses compact the soil , and when the soil is compacted , air spaces are minimized , leaving nowhere for water to collect . When this occurs , soil in areas where horses are prevalent has a water penetration resistance over 15 times higher than that in areas without horses . Trampling also causes soil erosion and damages vegetation , and because the soil cannot hold water , plant regrowth is hindered . Horse trampling also has the potential to damage waterways and bog habitats . Trampling near streams increases runoff , reducing the quality of the water and causing harm to the ecosystem of the waterway . Horse excrement tends to foul these waterways , as does the accumulation of carcasses that result when feral horses perish , adding to the negative environmental impact of this exotic species in Australia . 
 Alpine areas , such as those of Kosciuszko National Park , are at particular risk ; low @-@ growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling , and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage . The biodiversity there is high , with 853 species of plant , 21 of which are found nowhere else . Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting . Sphagnum moss is an important component of highland bogs , and is trampled by horses seeking water . 
 Feral horses may also reduce the richness of plant species . Exposure of soil caused by trampling and vegetation removal via grazing , combined with increased nutrients being recycled by horse dung , favour weed species , which then invade the region and overtake native species , diminishing their diversity . The dispersal of weeds is aided by the attachment of seeds to the horses ’ manes and tails , and are also transferred via horse dung after consumption of weeds in one location and excrement in another . Although the effects of the weeds that actually germinate after transfer via dung is debated , the fact that a large number of weed species are dispersed via this method is of concern to those interested in the survival of native plant species in Australia . The effect on plants and plant habitats are more pronounced during droughts , when horses travel greater distances to find food and water . They consume the already threatened and limited vegetation , and their negative influences are more widespread . Feral horses may also chew the bark of trees , which may leave some trees vulnerable to external threats . This has occurred during drought , among eucalyptus species on the Red Range plateau . It appears as though feral horses may prefer these species . 
 = = = Interaction with other animal species = = = 
 The changes in vegetation that result when feral horses <unk> a region affects bird species by removing plants upon which they feed , as well as altering the habitat of the birds and their prey . Feral horse grazing is also linked to a decline in reptiles and amphibians due to habitat loss . In addition , the grazing and trampling near waterways influences aquatic fauna . In areas frequented by horses , crab densities are higher , increasing the propensity for predation on fish . As a result , fish densities decline as the removal of vegetation renders them more susceptible to predation . 
 In areas where horses are abundant , macropod populations are less prevalent . This is most likely due to the horses ’ consumption of vegetation upon which the macropods normally feed . When horses are removed , signs of the presence of various macropods , specifically the black @-@ footed rock wallaby , increase . Thus , competition with horses may be the reason for the decline in macropod populations in certain areas . 
 Brumby populations also may have the potential to pass exotic diseases , such as equine influenza and African horse sickness to domestic horses . They also may carry tick fever , which can be passed to both horses and cattle . This can lead to high fatalities among domestic populations , causing many farmers to call for the management of feral horses . 
 Like all livestock , Brumbies can carry the parasite Cryptosporidium parvum , which can result in serious gastroenteritis in people drinking contaminated drinking water . 
 = = Population management = = 
 Although poor management of feral horses may pose an ecological and environmental threat in some parts of Australia , their management is made difficult by issues of feasibility and public concern . Currently , management attempts vary , as feral horses are considered pests in some states , such as South Australia , but not others , including Queensland . There is also controversy over removal of Brumbies from National Parks . The primary argument in favour of the removal of Brumbies is that they impact on fragile ecosystems and damage and destroy endangered native flora and fauna . 
 Public concern is a major issue in control efforts as many advocate for the protection of Brumbies , including the Aboriginal people , who believe feral horses belong to the country . Other horse interest groups resent the labelling of horses as “ feral ” and are completely opposed to any measures that threaten their survival . While some Animal welfare groups such as the RSPCA reluctantly accept culling , other organizations such as Save the Brumbies oppose lethal culling techniques and attempt to organise relocation of the animals instead . It has been argued that relocation , which often involves hours of helicopter mustering , would be more traumatic for the horses . 
 Meanwhile , conservationist groups , such as the Australian Conservation Foundation , favour humane culling as a means of control because of the damage Brumby overpopulation can cause to native flora and fauna , but are also generally opposed to various means of extermination . This makes management a challenge for policymakers , though at present , the cost of allowing overpopulation of feral horses seems to outweigh other concerns . 
 = = = Population control methods = = = 
 The traditional method of removal , called Brumby running , is reminiscent of Banjo Paterson 's iconic poem , The Man from Snowy River where expert riders rope the Brumbies and remove them to a new location . 
 Options for population control include fertility control , ground and helicopter shooting , and mustering and trapping . None of the methods provide complete freedom from suffering for the horses , and the cost of each is very high . The costs include those that are economic , such as research , equipment purchases , and labour expenditures , as well as moral concerns over the welfare of the horses . As a result , more effective and efficient means of control have been called for . 
 Fertility control is a non @-@ lethal method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment , and its use is supported by the RSPCA . While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection , the lasting effects are debated . Because it is costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly , this method , despite being ideal , is not widely implemented . 
 Shooting by trained marksmen is considered to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness . The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering , <unk> , and long @-@ distance transportation , all of which are related to ' capture and removal ' methods . Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible , open country . However , shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control . Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations , and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination . This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control , but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane . Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials , while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas . 
 Mustering is a labour @-@ intensive process that results in one of two major outcomes : slaughter for sale , or relocation . It may be assisted by feed @-@ luring in which bales of hay are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a location where capture is feasible . Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses , making it less desirable than fertility control or shooting , which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them . 
 = = = Management in national parks = = = 
 Between 22 October and 24 October 2000 , approximately 600 Brumbies were shot in the Guy Fawkes River National Park by the National Parks and Wildlife Service . As a result of the public outcry that followed the NSW Government established a Steering Committee to investigate alternative methods of control . Since the campaign began to remove horses from the national park , over 400 have been passively trapped and taken from the Park , and 200 of these have been re @-@ homed . 
 A NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service cull during 2006 and 2007 in Kosciuszko National Park , where there were an estimated 1700 horses in 2005 , resulted in a reduction of 64 horses . 
 The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service commenced a plan in 2007 to reduce Brumby numbers by passive trapping in the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park . Over 60 Brumbies captured in the Apsley River Gorge have now been re @-@ homed . 
 In 2008 the third phase of an aerial culling of Brumbies took place , by shooting 700 horses from a helicopter , in Carnarvon Gorge in Carnarvon National Park , Queensland .

 Brumbies , called " wild bush horses " , are mentioned in Banjo Paterson 's poem The Man from Snowy River . This poem was expanded into the films The Man from Snowy River and The Man from Snowy River II ( US title : " Return to Snowy River " – UK title : " The Untamed " ) – also The Man from Snowy River ( TV series ) and The Man from Snowy River : Arena Spectacular . 
 Another Banjo Paterson poem , called Brumby 's Run , describes a mob of Brumbies running wild . Paterson was inspired to write the poem when he read of a N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge , who on hearing of Brumby horses , asked : " Who is Brumby , and where is his Run ? " 
 The popular Silver Brumby books by Elyne Mitchell were written for children and young adults . The stories describe the adventures of <unk> , a Brumby stallion . These stories were dramatised and made into a movie of the same name ( also known as The Silver Stallion : King of the Wild Brumbies ) , starring Russell Crowe and Caroline Goodall . And also an animated children 's television series . 
 The Brumby was adopted as an emblem in 1996 by then newly formed ACT Brumbies , a rugby union team based in Canberra , Australia competing in what was then known as Super 12 , now Super Rugby . 
 = Wandsworth Bridge = 
 Wandsworth Bridge crosses the River Thames in west London . It carries the A217 road between the area of Battersea , near Wandsworth Town Station , in the London Borough of Wandsworth on the south of the river , and the areas of Sands End and Parsons Green , in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham , on the north side . 
 The first bridge on the site was a toll bridge built by Julian Tolmé in 1873 , in the expectation that the western terminus of the Hammersmith and City Railway would shortly be built on the north bank , leading to a sharp increase in the number of people wanting to cross the river at this point . The railway terminus was not built , and problems with drainage on the approach road made access to the bridge difficult for vehicles . Wandsworth Bridge was commercially unsuccessful , and in 1880 it was taken into public ownership and made toll @-@ free . Tolmé 's bridge was narrow and too weak to carry buses , and in 1926 a Royal Commission recommended its replacement . 
 In 1937 Tolmé 's bridge was demolished . The present bridge , an unadorned steel cantilever bridge designed by Sir Thomas Peirson Frank , was opened in 1940 . At the time of its opening it was painted in dull shades of blue as camouflage against air raids , a colour scheme it retains . Although Wandsworth Bridge is one of the busiest bridges in London , carrying over 50 @,@ 000 vehicles daily , it has been described as " probably the least noteworthy bridge in London " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although opposite each other across the River Thames , Fulham on the north bank and Wandsworth on the south bank were historically isolated from each other ; the nearest crossing points were at Putney Bridge to the west and Battersea Bridge to the east , both over a mile from Wandsworth . The fast flowing but narrow River Wandle at Wandsworth was well @-@ situated for driving watermills , leading to the rapid spread of industry in the area during the 19th century . Nearby Battersea Railway Bridge opened in 1863 , but as the local population grew and London 's built @-@ up area began to encroach during the 19th century , pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased . 
 In 1864 , it was expected that the newly formed Hammersmith and City Railway would build its western terminus on the north bank of the river between Chelsea and Fulham . In 1864 , in anticipation of the new railway line generating high demand for a river crossing , an Act of Parliament was passed granting permission to the Wandsworth Bridge Company to build a bridge , to be financed by tolls , with the proviso that the bridge would be at least 40 feet ( 12 m ) wide and cross the river with no more than three spans . Rowland Mason Ordish designed an Ordish – Lefeuvre Principle bridge to comply with the Act 's specifications , of a similar design to his nearby Albert Bridge . Wandsworth Bridge and Albert Bridge were authorised on the same day , and were the last private <unk> authorised in London . 
 = = 1873 bridge = = 
 The company was unable to finance the building of Ordish 's design , and in 1870 a new Act of Parliament was passed giving the company permission to build a bridge 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) wide , crossing the river with five spans . Ordish was asked to design a cheaper bridge to the new specifications but refused to change the design , so Julian Tolmé was appointed designer in his place . Tolmé designed a starkly functional lattice truss bridge of wrought iron . It cost £ 40 @,@ 000 ( about £ 3 @.@ 2 million in 2016 ) to build , and consisted of five identical spans , supported by four pairs of concrete @-@ filled iron piers ; each of the cylindrical piers was sunk 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) into the riverbed . The bridge was due to open in early 1873 , but the workmen building it went on strike , and a third Act of Parliament was necessary to give the company time to resolve the dispute and complete the project . 
 Wandsworth Bridge was formally opened in a small ceremony in 1873 , and a celebratory buffet was provided at the nearby Spread Eagle pub . A utilitarian structure made of mismatched materials purchased for cheapness , the new bridge elicited unenthusiastic responses ; the Illustrated London News remarked at the time of its opening that " No attempt has been made to produce architectural effect , the structure being substantial rather than ornamental " . A 1 ⁄ 2d toll was charged on pedestrians , and carts were charged 6d . 
 In 1867 the formerly independent Hammersmith and City Railway was absorbed by the Metropolitan Railway and the Great Western Railway , and was operated from then on by Metropolitan Railway trains . The plan for a terminus in Fulham was abandoned , and the line instead turned west at Hammersmith to run over London and South Western Railway tracks to Richmond . Although Wandsworth Town railway station , near the southern end of the bridge , had provided direct connections to central London since 1846 , the lack of rail connections opening on the north bank meant the area on the Fulham side remained undeveloped , and bridge usage was low . Tolmé 's design was not sturdy enough to carry heavy vehicles , and drainage problems on the approach road to the north discouraged vehicles from using Wandsworth Bridge . 
 = = = Public ownership = = = 
 Wandsworth Bridge never raised enough toll revenue to cover the costs of repairs and maintenance . In 1877 the Metropolis Toll Bridges Act was passed , and in 1880 Wandsworth Bridge , along with other London bridges , was taken into the public ownership of the Metropolitan Board of Works . Despite having run at a loss throughout its lifetime , the Board of Works paid £ 53 @,@ 313 ( about £ 4 @.@ 5 million in 2016 ) for the bridge , a substantial premium on its £ 40 @,@ 000 construction cost . On 26 June 1880 Edward , Prince of Wales , and Alexandra , Princess of Wales , presided over a ceremony abolishing tolls over the three bridges . 
 By the time it was taken into public ownership , the bridge was in very poor condition . In 1891 a weight limit of 5 tons was introduced , and in 1897 a 10 mph ( 16 km / h ) speed limit was imposed . With its narrowness and weight restrictions , by this point it was effectively a footbridge . As narrowness and weight restrictions meant that it was unable to carry buses , in 1926 a Royal Commission recommended its replacement and the London County Council agreed to finance a new bridge on the site . In 1928 it was decided instead to give priority to widening the much busier Putney Bridge , and the replacement of Wandsworth Bridge was delayed . 
 = = 1940 bridge = = 
 In 1935 , the Ministry of Transport agreed to finance 60 percent of the projected £ 503 @,@ 000 ( about £ 31 @.@ 5 million in 2016 ) cost of a replacement bridge , and the London County Council approved a new design , by Sir Thomas Peirson Frank , for a three @-@ span steel cantilever bridge 60 feet ( 18 m ) in width , allowing two lanes of traffic in each direction , and designed to allow widening to 80 feet ( 24 m ) if necessary . The design featured distinctive low curves , intended to reflect the low riverbanks in the area . The design was presented to the Royal Fine Art Commission for approval , with a covering note stating that " in the design of the bridge a severe simplicity of treatment has been carried out , expressed in a technique essentially related to the material proposed for its construction " . Although the Commission expressed concern that the bridge might be too narrow , the design was approved . The work was put out for tender , with a stipulation that all materials used in the construction of the new bridge should be of British origin or manufacture . 
 The contract for the new bridge was awarded to Messrs Holloway Brothers ( London ) , and work began in 1937 . A temporary footbridge that had been used during the redevelopment of Chelsea Bridge between 1935 and 1937 was re @-@ erected alongside Wandsworth Bridge , and the existing bridge demolished . The new bridge was expected to be complete in 1939 ; however , a shortage of steel in the buildup to the Second World War delayed its opening until 25 September 1940 . The steel panels cladding the bridge were painted in varying shades of blue to camouflage it from German and Italian air raids , a colour scheme it retains today . Although it is one of London 's busiest bridges , carrying over 50 @,@ 000 vehicles per day , its drab colour scheme and minimalist design have led to it being described as " probably the least noteworthy bridge in London " .

 Historically , the southern approach roads had been in poor condition and confusing to use . In 1969 the Greater London Council built the A214 road , a three @-@ lane dual carriageway linking the southern end of Wandsworth Bridge to Tooting . At the immediate southern end of the bridge is a large roundabout adjacent to Wandsworth Town railway station , where Bridgend Road ( A217 ) , York Road ( <unk> ) , <unk> Way ( A217 ) and Trinity Road ( A214 ) meet . The roundabout is a noted example of 1960s modernist design , and served as the setting for parts of A Clockwork Orange in 1971 . In 2007 approval was granted for a series of 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) glass cone @-@ shaped " flames " designed by architect Steven <unk> , which would change colour with the tides , to be added to the bridge deck . The cost , estimated at £ 800 @,@ 000 , would be raised by private sponsorship . The " flames " were to be raised above the sightlines of drivers to avoid causing a distraction . 
 Wandsworth Bridge now marks the boundary above which a lower speed limit on the Thames is enforced . A 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) speed limit is now in force downstream from Wandsworth to <unk> but because of the number of rowers using the upper reaches of the river , all of the tidal Thames upstream of Wandsworth Bridge is subject to a strictly enforced speed limit of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ) .

 Mega Man 4 , known in Japan as Rockman 4 Aratanaru <unk> ! ! ( <unk> <unk> ! ! , Rokkuman Fō Aratanaru <unk> ! ! , lit . " Rockman 4 : A New Ambition ! ! " ) , is a action @-@ platform game developed by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System . It is the fourth game in the original Mega Man series and was originally released in Japan in 1991 . The game was localized in North America the following January , and in Europe in 1993 . 
 The game 's story takes place after the third defeat and supposed death of Dr. Wily , and features the Earth coming under threat from a mysterious scientist named Dr. Cossack and his eight " Robot Masters " . Fearing the worst , Dr. Light sends Mega Man to save the world once again . Mega Man 4 carries on the same action and platforming gameplay as the first three games , in which the player completes a series of stages in any order and adds the weapon of each stage 's boss to Mega Man 's arsenal . One notable added feature is the " New Mega Buster " ( often shortened to " Mega Buster " ) , an upgraded arm cannon that lets the player charge a regular shot into a much more powerful blast . The development team was mindful that this innovation would change the overall feel of the game . 
 Despite Mega Man 4 receiving positive critical reviews during its early 1990s release , the game is widely regarded today to represent a downward shift from the quality of the first three games in the series . The Mega Buster itself has been considered an overused mechanic by several sources . Mega Man 4 was re @-@ released on the Japanese PlayStation , PlayStation Network , and mobile phones ; the North American Mega Man Anniversary Collection ; and worldwide on the Virtual Console for 3 Nintendo systems ( Wii , Nintendo 3DS and Wii U ) .

 Mega Man 4 takes place in an unspecified year during the 21st century , described as the year " 200X " . One year after the events of Mega Man 3 , a mysterious Russian scientist named Dr. Cossack unleashes an army of robots with the intention of world domination , much like Dr. Wily before him . Dr. Light calls upon his own greatest creation , the hero Mega Man , to go after Cossack 's Robot Masters , who have seized control of eight cities . He also equips Mega Man with the New Mega Buster , which he developed in secret . 
 Upon defeating the eight Robot Masters — Toad Man , Bright Man , Pharaoh Man , Ring Man , Dust Man , Skull Man , Dive Man , and Drill Man — Mega Man makes his way to Cossack 's icy fortress . However , in the middle of his battle with Cossack , Mega Man 's brother Proto Man teleports in with Cossack 's daughter , Kalinka . The girl begs Mega Man to stop fighting her father and elaborating that Dr. Wily had kidnapped her and forced her father into building an army of robots . With Wily 's plan undone by Proto Man , he steps out of the shadows . Mega Man pursues his nemesis and fights through the scientist 's Wily Castle , but Wily manages to escape in the end . Mega Man escapes as the fortress begins to self @-@ destruct , and rides home on the top of a passing train , where he is greeted by Roll and Rush .

 Mega Man 4 features similar gameplay to the previous three games . The player must complete a series of eight stages in an order of the player 's choosing . The protagonist , Mega Man , is able to run , jump , shoot , and climb his way past obstacles and enemies ; the game also retains the slide ability which debuted in Mega Man 3 . At the end of each stage is a Robot Master boss . Upon defeating a Robot Master , Mega Man gains the Robot Master 's signature weapon , which can then be used by the player in subsequent stages . Once all eight Robot Masters are destroyed , two separate sets of linear stages must be completed to finish the game . One major addition to the gameplay in Mega Man 4 is the " Mega Buster " , an upgraded version of Mega Man 's arm cannon . By holding down the firing button , the player can now charge a shot , resulting in a blast far more powerful than the standard shot . This feature was later used in subsequent incarnations of the franchise . 
 The hero 's dog Rush makes a return from Mega Man 3 with the ability to transform into " Coil " , " Jet " , and " Marine " modes for navigating different environments . Aside from Rush , two additional support items called the " Wire Adaptor " and the " Balloon Adaptor " also aid the player in reaching areas not normally accessible . However , these hidden adaptors must be found in the stages rather than being awarded for defeating a Robot Master . Like the Master Weapons , the three Rush modes and the two adaptors are each limited to an amount of weapon power that drains when in use . The character " Flip Top " Eddie is introduced in Mega Man 4 . Eddie , who went on to appear in later Mega Man games , provides the player with a random item ( such as health or ammunition ) at designated points in some of the levels .

 Mega Man series artist Keiji Inafune , credited as " Inafking " , stated that the development team had very few problems while working on Mega Man 4 . Inafune designed Dr. Cossack and Kalinka as two new storyline characters for the game . Cossack , who was originally named " Dr. Vice " , was made much younger than Dr. Light and Dr. Wily . Inafune also considered giving him American traits , but decided upon influences from Russia instead . Kalinka was created because so many male characters already existed in the series at this point . However , Inafune did not intend for players to compare her to Mega Man 's sister Roll . The idea for Eddie originally came about during the development of Mega Man 2 . Eddie was designed as a supporting character that " would behave like a lottery " , either pleasantly surprising or disappointing the player with the item he gives Mega Man . 
 Mega Man 4 was the first game in the series for Hayato Kaji , credited as " K. Hayato " , a prominent designer for many later Mega Man games . Kaji was responsible for the chargeable Mega Buster , a gameplay mechanic that would become a staple of the series . " We knew adding a two @-@ level or three @-@ level charge would change the whole flavor of the game in some respects , and we were very mindful of that , " Inafune explained . The Robot Masters in Mega Man 4 are a result of a design contest for fans held in Japan . With over 70 @,@ 000 character submissions , the development team spent an extended period of time narrowing them down to only eight bosses . According to Kaji , the team was very satisfied with many of the chosen designs and almost no changes were made to their original illustrations . They were so impressed with Skull Man that they scrapped an entire level being created just so they could restart it and devote it to that Robot Master . The winning eight contestants of the design contest were each issued a special " golden cartridge " edition of Mega Man 4 . As there are only eight of these cartridges in existence , they are extremely rare and fetch a large collector 's price today . The musical score for Mega Man 4 was composed by Minae Fujii , credited as " <unk> " , while the sound programming and sound effects were handled by <unk> Fujita , credited as " Bun Bun " , who had composed the soundtrack for Mega Man 3 the previous year .

 Mega Man 4 has received mostly positive critical reviews . Reviews contemporary with the game 's release by the United States magazine Nintendo Power and the United Kingdom publications Nintendo Magazine System and Total ! all found Mega Man 4 to have high quality graphics , sound , and gameplay . However , they also noted very little improvement over previous entries in the series . GamePro was satisfied with the lack of changes . " Mega Man 4 continues the tradition — crazed robot baddies , good character graphics , great background art and warped , mechanical music , " the reviewer said . " When you have a good game , why make radical changes ? Capcom sticks to the blueprints in Mega Man 4 — guaranteeing happiness for Mega Man fans everywhere . " Mega Man 4 made it into IGN 's " Top 100 NES Games " list at number 95 , with staff writer Matt Casamassina praising its attempt at better narrative and an essentially similar experience to the first three Mega Man games . Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that , as a stand @-@ alone title , the game is one of the best experiences available from the NES library , although not when compared to its superior predecessors . He enjoyed the use of a second set of castle levels to significantly extend the length of the game , a tradition carried on by the next two titles in the series .
