 Gunn 's training and performances for the reserve team and occasional first @-@ team appearances paid dividends : he was called up for the Scotland under @-@ 21 team , and made his debut in November 1983 against East Germany . He also received Scottish League Cup and European Cup Winners Cup winner 's medals while with Aberdeen , although he was an unused substitute in both finals . He made an unexpected appearance in the 1986 European Cup quarter final , against Gothenburg . " Jim and I were warming up and he lost [ his ] contact lenses [ so ] I ended up being included in the starting line up , " Gunn recalls . Gunn had an excellent match : The Glasgow Herald 's match report stated , " Only outstanding work by Willie Miller and Bryan Gunn kept the Swedes at bay " . As well as making several key saves , he was credited with playing a part in Aberdeen 's second goal following a long kick upfield . 
 As Leighton was unlikely to be dislodged , Ferguson promised to find Gunn another club , and fulfilled his pledge when he sold him for £ 100 @,@ 000 to Norwich City in October 1986 . The transfer nearly went through in the summer of 1986 , but Ferguson delayed the move until October to allow time for Leighton to recover from an injury . 
 = = = Norwich City = = = 
 Gunn says of the move south : " Norwich was easy to settle into , a bit like Aberdeen in many ways — a city surrounded by lovely countryside and lots of farms . " However , since he joined the club partway into the new season , he initially found it difficult to take over as first @-@ choice goalkeeper . Gunn had been bought as a replacement for England international goalkeeper Chris Woods , who had moved to Rangers F.C. Meanwhile , reserve team keeper Graham Benstead made a series of good performances and Norwich were top of the league . Ken Brown wanted to be fair to Benstead and made Gunn wait . A 6 – 2 defeat at Anfield proved to be the catalyst for Gunn 's promotion to the first team . He made his debut in a Full Members Cup win against Coventry City , conceding a penalty , and made his league debut in a 2 – 1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur at Carrow Road on 8 November 1986 . 
 Norwich went on to finish fifth in the First Division in his first season , their highest @-@ ever league finish at the time . By May 1988 Gunn 's consistency meant his value had risen considerably , and the club reportedly declined a £ 500 @,@ 000 offer from Ian Porterfield to take the goalkeeper back to Aberdeen . The purpose of the proposed transfer was to replace Leighton , who by then had moved to Manchester United , where he was reunited with Alex Ferguson . 
 Norwich reached the semi @-@ final of the FA Cup in 1989 with Gunn in goal , but he missed the semi @-@ final in 1992 through injury . What has been described as his — and Norwich 's — greatest moment came in their upset victory over European giants Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup in 1993 . The Independent described the match as " the pinnacle of Norwich City 's history " . Gunn made several saves that kept the Canaries in the match . He describes the save he made from Bayern striker Adolfo Valencia as the finest of his career ; it has also been described as " one of the most outstanding saves by a City goalkeeper " . However , he was involved in an own @-@ goal incident in an East Anglian derby match in the 1995 – 96 season , when a backpass from Robert <unk> bounced awkwardly off the pitch and over Gunn 's attempted clearance kick . 
 In November 1989 , Gunn was involved in a controversial incident that attracted significant media attention . Norwich played Arsenal at Highbury and with five minutes remaining , Arsenal 's David O 'Leary scored an equaliser that brought the scores to 3 – 3 . Then , in the dying seconds of the match , the referee awarded Arsenal a penalty kick — and the chance to seal the match . The Norwich players were already annoyed by the match situation , and their perception was that the decision was " really dodgy " . Gunn saved Lee Dixon 's shot , but the ball was not cleared . In the resulting melee , Mark Bowen and Ian Culverhouse for Norwich and Alan Smith for Arsenal challenged for the ball . " The three of them got in an almighty tangle and the ball , along with all of them , was bundled over the line , " Gunn remembers . The goal was awarded , but the situation rapidly deteriorated : the three players in the goal had " a little skirmish " . Separately , Arsenal 's Nigel Winterburn gave " a gloat to Dale Gordon , who promptly pushed him " . The result was mayhem : 
 All of a sudden it was kicking off , big time . Everyone started piling in , right in front of me ... The only people not involved were [ Arsenal players ] John Lukic , Tony Adams , David O 'Leary and me ... I went over to break things up ... and spotted the cavalry coming over the half @-@ way line , in the shape of O 'Leary and Adams . I felt it was my job to head them off at the pass and moved in , instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other . " 
 All but one of the 22 players on the pitch were involved in the fracas , but no one was sent off . The next day , the newspapers carried headlines and photos of what they called ' The Highbury Brawl ' . That afternoon , Gunn received a phone call from a Today journalist , who told him that the Arsenal players had said Gunn had instigated the fight . Enraged , the Norwich keeper retorted that it was the other way around . Monday 's headline read " Gunn blames Arsenal " . Gunn was censured by The Football Association and warned about his future conduct . Both clubs were fined , and Gunn was docked a fortnight 's wages ( about £ 800 ) by Norwich City . 
 Under the management of Gary Megson , Norwich were seventh in the Premier League in the 1994 – 95 season when Gunn broke and dislocated his ankle whilst playing against Nottingham Forest . His importance to the team was underlined when they subsequently plummeted down the table , winning just one of their remaining 17 games as Gunn recovered . The team was ultimately relegated . Gunn retained a regular first team place for the 1995 – 96 season and , beginning with the match against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 17 February 1996 , began to captain the side , initially in the absence of regular captain Jon Newsome then on a permanent basis after Newsome left the club . However , when Mike Walker took over as manager for the following 1996 – 97 season , he appointed Ian Crook as captain instead . 
 Gunn 's final first @-@ team game for the club was a 1 – 0 defeat at Crewe on 31 January 1998 . According to the Sunday Mirror , he produced " a sparkling display " , which proved his abilities had " not been dulled by time " . Gunn made 478 first team appearances for Norwich in all competitions . He was voted Norwich City Player of the Year in 1988 and 1993 . The latter award came at the end of the 1992 – 93 FA Premier League season , in which Norwich finished third in the Premier League , their best @-@ ever performance . The club awarded Gunn a testimonial match in 1996 , and Alex Ferguson brought Manchester United to Carrow Road . 
 = = = Hibernian = = = 
 In the 1997 – 98 season , Gunn was forced out of the Norwich team by the emergence of Andy Marshall . With his first @-@ team opportunities at Norwich now limited , he signed a deal with Hibernian in February 1998 , for a three @-@ month loan . According to Scottish transfer regulations the loan deal was invalid , so instead he was swiftly transferred on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee , later revealed by Gunn to have been £ 25 @,@ 000 . 
 Gunn 's reflections on joining Hibernian are tinged with regret : " [ leaving Norwich was ] very difficult indeed . I had spent 12 great years at Norwich and suddenly I was not regarded as the number 1 ( by Mike Walker ) anymore . " He joined Hibernian when they were bottom of the Scottish Premier Division ; Alex McLeish had recently been appointed manager . 
 Gunn was unable to save the club from relegation to the First Division , but signed a two @-@ year contract in July 1998 . However , a hairline fracture to his leg , sustained during the 1998 close season , effectively ended his playing career . On his doctors ' advice , Gunn formally retired in March 1999 . 
 Despite his mixed feelings on joining the club , Gunn 's overall impression of his time in Edinburgh is upbeat : " I only played 12 games for the Hibees but it was great . We beat Hearts in my only derby game 2 – 1 ( John Robertson scored his 50th goal for Hearts in derbies but I told him it was worth nothing as we had won ) and had a clean sheet at Celtic Park ( stopping them from winning the SPL that day ) . " He received what he described as a " wonderful reception " from Aberdeen fans when playing for Hibernian against his former club . 
 = = = Internationals = = = 
 Gunn represented Scotland at the youth international level . He was part of the squad that won the 1982 UEFA European Under @-@ 18 Football Championship , but was unavailable to play in the final because Aberdeen had reached the 1982 Scottish Cup Final . He was replaced by Robin Rae for the final , in which the Scots beat Czechoslovakia 3 – 1 . 
 In 1983 , Gunn travelled with the Scotland Under @-@ 19s to Mexico for the 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship . Gunn played in all four of Scotland 's matches and it was a formative experience , as he faced a variety of challenges in the tournament . The adidas ball in use " really zipped through the air " , which encouraged long @-@ range shots at the high altitude . In the first match , against South Korea , an element of the 26 @,@ 000 crowd " clearly didn 't like us at all ... I got absolutely pelted with coins ... and rotten fruit " . The final insult was when he was hit on the back of the neck by a rancid @-@ smelling plastic bag containing rotten fish . Gunn found it " intimidation ... a nightmare " but adopted the strategy of patrolling the edge of his area to stay out of range and had " one of the best games of my life " : he kept a clean sheet as Scotland won 2 – 0 . Scotland 's coach and future manager of the full international team Andy Roxburgh told Gunn " it was the best performance he 'd ever seen from a Scottish goalkeeper , at any level . " The final group match , which Scotland needed to win in order to progress , was against the home side , Mexico . The official attendance at the Azteca Stadium was 86 @,@ 582 , although Gunn believes the true figure was over 100 @,@ 000 . Once more , Gunn was targeted with a variety of missiles , including a bottle of Johnnie Walker , but as Scotland held on to their early 1 – 0 lead , the fans became disillusioned with their own team and switched to sending a " hail of bottles and coins " on the Mexican players . Scotland lost 1 – 0 in the quarter final against Poland . 
 Gunn made six full international appearances for Scotland , conceding 10 goals . He was a member of the squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup , but played in none of Scotland 's three matches at the tournament , as he was third @-@ choice goalkeeper behind Jim Leighton and Andy Goram . He made his Scotland debut in a pre @-@ tournament friendly match against Egypt , but was at fault for two Egyptian goals , resulting in a 3 – 1 defeat for Scotland . The embarrassment was made worse by the fact that his parents were watching . Gunn made four appearances for Scotland in 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification matches . His last cap was as a second @-@ half substitute in a 3 – 1 friendly defeat by the Netherlands in May 1994 .

 = = Coaching career and other activities = = 
 Gunn obtained his coaching certification while still with Aberdeen , in 1983 , at Largs . After his retirement from playing professional football in 1999 , Gunn initially worked on the hospitality staff at Carrow Road , particularly in " The Gunn Club " , a catering outlet named in his honour . 
 Over the years , Gunn progressed from hospitality into other corporate positions at Norwich ; he acted as sponsorship manager from 1999 to 2006 . Manager Peter Grant moved Gunn to the " backroom " sports management side of the business in 2007 . Gunn worked in a liaison role in negotiations of possible transfers and loan signings , tasks where he could make use of contacts gained during his playing career . 
 When Glenn Roeder was appointed manager in November 2007 , goalkeeping coach James Hollman parted company with the club , and Gunn replaced him for the rest of the season — his first formal coaching role . Later in the season , Gunn was promoted to head of player recruitment , while retaining his goalkeeping coach role . 
 = = = Manager of Norwich City = = = 
 Following the sacking of Roeder as Norwich manager in January 2009 , Gunn was asked to take temporary charge of the first team . In an interview with BBC Radio Norfolk , he revealed that he " told the players that they 've let people down . " In his first match as caretaker manager , he received " a euphoric reception " from the fans , and Norwich beat Barnsley 4 – 0 . The players were equally supportive : according to Scotland on Sunday , " in the dressing room afterwards , [ Norwich ] midfielder , Darel Russell , dragged the chairman , Roger <unk> , into the shower , and demanded that Gunn be appointed permanently . " Momentum gathered , and a Facebook group called " Bryan Gunn for manager " , created by his then 17 @-@ year @-@ old daughter , Melissa , soon attracted about 3 @,@ 000 members . Gunn considered applying for the role on a longer @-@ term basis ; he had previously applied without success to be Norwich manager in 1998 . On 19 January 2009 he phoned the directors and requested to be considered . He was interviewed that afternoon and " by 10 @.@ 30 am the next day had been appointed manager until the end of the season " . 
 Gunn appointed a backroom staff of former Norwich colleagues , making Ian Crook first @-@ team coach and John Deehan chief scout . However , the initial turnaround in form could not be maintained ; having lost their last three games of the season , Norwich were relegated from the Championship . Gunn labelled his players as an " embarrassment " after the 4 – 2 defeat to Charlton Athletic that sealed relegation to League One . Despite relegation to the third tier of English football for the first time in nearly 50 years , Writing in Tales from the City , Gunn said of the match " Even going to Charlton on the last day , I thought we could survive … We lost 4 @-@ 2 and were relegated to the third tier . I was shell @-@ shocked ; the emptiest I have ever felt in a sporting or professional context . The directors went on the field to face the fans and to thank them for their support and I had tears in my eyes when I saw Delia and Michael doing that . I told them how sorry I was . " 
 Relegation changed Gunn 's mind about taking the Norwich job . He had decided not to continue in the role if Norwich had remained in The Championship , and would have tried to land a job with Norwich that would have allowed more time to be spent with his family . However , " Relegation was a failure and I felt I couldn ’ t quit then . I felt I had to do everything I could to put things right , if I was given the chance . And I was . " 
 Norwich re @-@ appointed Gunn as manager for the 2009 – 10 season . Crook , as first team coach , and former Canary Ian Butterworth , as assistant manager , completed the management team . Over the summer , Gunn signed 12 players , most of those on free transfers , including Australian Michael Theoklitos , a goalkeeper from Melbourne Victory . He then steered the club through a programme of pre @-@ season friendly matches , in which Norwich was unbeaten . 
 Just under a month after Gunn 's reappointment , Norwich appointed a new managing director , David McNally . With the disappointment of relegation , Gunn 's reappointment was controversial , and more was to follow . For the opening game of the new season , Norwich were to play at home against Colchester United , rivals for the Pride of Anglia . Gunn 's team suffered a 7 – 1 defeat , and Theoklitos , signed by Gunn on a free transfer , was particularly blamed by the press for the scale of the defeat . Theoklitos later admitted it was " the worst performance of my career " . Despite this , he retained Gunn 's support , although in the eventuality , Theoklitos never played for Norwich again . 
 As early as during the match itself , fans and the media began to react strongly to the shock of Norwich 's worst @-@ ever home defeat . During the first half , after the side had gone 4 – 0 down , two supporters approached the Norwich bench , appearing to throw their season tickets at Gunn . Many fans walked out before the match ended , and around 300 people protested outside the ground afterwards . Media coverage of the match was unsurprisingly negative : the BBC used terms such as " calamitous defending " , " Colchester run riot " , " dismal " , and a " disastrous start " ; journalists also speculated about Gunn 's competence as a manager . Matters seemed to stabilise a little with a 4 – 0 League Cup win at Yeovil the following Tuesday . However , Gunn was sacked by McNally on 14 August 2009 , six days after the defeat by Colchester . 
 Gunn was influenced in his management philosophy by former Norwich manager Mike Walker . Himself a former goalkeeper , Walker believed — contrary to popular opinion — that goalkeepers can make good managers because their excellent view of the game enables them to develop a good tactical awareness . Gunn 's short time at Norwich remains his only experience of professional football management . He says of the time spent as manager that his only regret is that " there must be a generation of fans who only know me as the manager who lost 7 @-@ 1 against Colchester … My own memories are different . "

 Gunn began work in November 2009 as director of business development for <unk> , part of the Digital Phone Company , based in Great Yarmouth . His role was to " promote their communication and mobile working solutions " . 
 In 2011 , Gunn announced he was leaving <unk> for a new job as a sports agent . In his new role as director of talent recruitment at a sports agency , he is responsible for recruiting young footballers .

 Gunn 's wife , Susan Gunn , is a painter . She won the inaugural Sovereign Art Prize in 2008 , which included a cash award of € 25 @,@ 000 . According to The Daily Telegraph , before her marriage , Susan was " a beauty queen turned lingerie model " who " launched a fashion business " . The couple met in Spain , where Susan had a bridal wear company , when Gunn was there on holiday . She told the Telegraph , " When I first met Bryan , I knew nothing about football and had no idea who he was because he told me he was a joiner . " Gunn explained that he was unsure what her attitude would be to footballers ; he later confessed his calling to her . He proposed within three days of their meeting , and they were married the following year . They lived in Framingham Pigot , near Norwich , until moving to Cheshire in May 2011 . The Gunns have had three children : Francesca , Melissa and Angus . Melissa is a model , while their son , Angus , is a footballer and plays in goal , like his father . On the books as a youth player at Norwich City , in October 2010 he was selected for England under @-@ 16s , a full year ahead of the age group . In July 2011 , Angus joined Manchester City ; he has " sharp reflexes and strong wrists " and an " ambitious streak " . 
 According to Scotland on Sunday , Gunn suffers from ankylosing spondylitis , " a rheumatic spinal condition " , diagnosed in about 1995 , " which he controls with medication " . He appeared in an ITV2 celebrity football quiz called " Taking the Pitch " in 1998 , alongside singer Fish . Gunn 's autobiography — In Where it Hurts — was published in 2006 , and includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson . He said of writing the book , " it brought up a lot of good memories and a lot of awkward memories " . The book was described by The Times as " shot through with sharp humour and astute observation " . The publishers agreed to donate £ 1 to Gunn 's Leukaemia appeal fund for every book sold . 
 = = = Leukaemia appeal = = = 
 In 1992 , Gunn 's two @-@ year @-@ old daughter , Francesca , was diagnosed with leukaemia . Norwich City fans were at first astonished by the sight of the goalkeeper running out with a completely shaven head . In the words of author and Norwich supporter , Kevin Baldwin , " Occasionally , the gap between the crowd and the players can cause unfortunate misunderstandings . A few months ago , Gunn shaved his head and we all laughed at him ... I was especially keen ... to shout " Baldy ! " ... It now turns out that his daughter was undergoing chemotherapy at the time , which made her hair fall out . He shaved his head to show her that this was nothing to be ashamed of . Sorry , Bryan . " When news spread of the reason for Gunn 's shaven head , he received " support from the whole of the sporting world and the people of Norfolk " . 
 Gunn describes the period of Francesca 's illness and death and how it caused him to reflect on his career : 
 " We had a charmed life ... then Francesca became ill . There was a game in the autumn of ' 92 ... that we lost 7 – 1 at Blackburn . The team stayed in a bleak hotel and it rained endlessly . I just wanted to get back home . With hindsight you think , ' Why the bloody hell was I playing ? ' Very soon afterwards , Francesca died . She was sleeping between us . I realised what was happening and woke Susan . We cradled Francesca and cried . " 
 Francesca died in 1992 , aged two . Gunn played a match for Norwich against Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road just days after his daughter died ; he said of it , " When I ran out , I thought , wow , I could feel the whole stadium was with me . I never thought about packing it in . " At the end of the season , Gunn won Norwich 's Player of the Year award , as the club finished third in the Premiership , its highest ever league position . 
 Following Francesca 's death , Gunn established " Bryan Gunn 's Leukaemia Appeal " , a fund to raise money to combat the disease . He initially set a target of £ 10 @,@ 000 , but by 2011 he has raised £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , under the auspices of The Dove Trust . The fund aims to address three issues : 
 " Equipping local hospitals to be better able to deal with children suffering from the disease on both in @-@ patient and out @-@ patient bases . Providing training for nurses and other staff involved in the care of children with leukaemia over and above that which is available from their employers . To support further research into the causes and cures of leukaemia . " 
 The third of these ambitions has prompted the funding of research into leukaemia at the Norwich @-@ based University of East Anglia . Gunn says : 
 " The ultimate aim is to find a cure and if that can be done in the laboratory at the University of East Anglia bearing Francesca 's name , then it would be the biggest testimony of all . Norwich is now one of the leading centres for leukaemia research and , with links to computer systems around the world , hopefully we 'll get there . " 
 In addition to the research , Gunn set up a telephone support line that offers advice and assistance for parents of children who have leukaemia or other forms of cancer . Known as gaps : line ( an acronym for Gunn Appeal Parent Support ) , the service quickly grew . From its initial pilot launch in Norfolk in early 2004 , it expanded to cover the " eastern region " by the end of the year , and launched nationally in early 2006 . The appeal has also funded other research and support work . 
 = = Playing style , personality , achievements and legacy = = 
 As a player , Gunn was described as " a leader with a big presence " by his manager at Hibernian , Alex McLeish . Aberdeen manager Alex Ferguson recalls , " the first thing that hit me was his personality . It was abundantly clear ... that he was a warm , outgoing and endearing character " , adding " He was a tremendous young keeper ... always totally professional and I could never fault his discipline , effort or commitment . " 
 Gunn had a " fantastic rapport with the Norwich supporters " . As a player , he liked " to tease the crowd during the game " . Before each half of a match , Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar . Gunn says this is a habit he began as a youngster , and cannot remember how or why he began to do it . Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and , in Gunn 's words , " would wait until I got to about the 18 @-@ yard line and then start a small " <unk> ... " which would build into a full @-@ blown " <unk> ... AH ! " ... I loved it and came close to smacking my head against the woodwork a couple of times " . During play , he would cup his ear , which would prompt shouts of " Bryan , Bryan , give us a wave " . 
 Gunn is described as " a legend in Norwich " , the result of his long years of service as player and official for the club . In 2002 , he was made one of 25 inaugural members of the Norwich City Hall of Fame . A 2005 Football Focus fan poll for " Norwich 's cult heroes " saw Gunn finish in first place . He polled 37 % of votes , ahead of Robert Fleck and Iwan Roberts . Gunn is one of just nine players to have twice won Norwich City Player of the Year , in 1988 and 1993 , and the only goalkeeper to do so . In 2003 , as part of the Premier League 10 Seasons Awards , he was one of 10 players to be recognised by the Premier League with an " Outstanding Contribution to the Community " award . In response to his achievements with Norwich City and his charitable work , which has benefited the local university , in 2002 Gunn was made Sheriff of Norwich for the year by the City Council .

The second spur ran into downtown Portland until it was decommissioned in 2007 . Two routes in the Detroit area — a loop through Farmington and a spur into Detroit — both using Grand River Avenue , and meeting at the temporary end of I @-@ 96 near Purdue Avenue , were eliminated when I @-@ 96 was moved to the completed Jeffries Freeway in 1977 .

The spur ran concurrently with M @-@ 46 southeasterly from the docks along Mart Street and Sixth Street . At the intersections with the one @-@ way pairing of Webster Avenue ( southbound ) and Muskegon Avenue ( northbound ) in downtown Muskegon , BS I @-@ 96 separated from M @-@ 46 and turned southward to follow Bus . US 31 while M @-@ 46 turned northward along Bus . US 31 . From there , BS I @-@ 96 / Bus . US 31 ran southwesterly along the one @-@ way pair for a few blocks before the two directions of traffic merged onto the north – south section of Seaway Drive southwest of downtown . The business route then ran due south along Seaway Drive , exiting Muskegon at Sherman Drive and crossing onto a section of the Norton Shores – Muskegon Heights city line . South of Norton Avenue , Seaway Drive turned eastward along the southern edge of Muskegon Heights . BS I @-@ 96 / Bus . US 31 ran along the northern edge of Mona Lake and crossed the Black Creek in Norton Shores . Southwest of the lake , the business route came to an end at the interchange along US 31 that marked the western starting point of I @-@ 96 . 
 When the state highway system was first signposted in 1919 , the east – west highway from Grand Haven through Nunica to Detroit was assigned the M @-@ 16 designation ; there was no state highway between Muskegon and Nunica , This was redesignated US 16 in 1926 . By 1934 , a state highway numbered M @-@ 126 was designated between Muskegon and Nunica , and this was replaced by a rerouted US 16 in 1940 . On December 12 , 1962 , the freeway that is now I @-@ 96 was initially completed across the state of Michigan from Muskegon to the Detroit area . After this completion , US 16 was decommissioned . West of Grand Rapids , the freeway was originally I @-@ 196 , and the route of former US 16 past the end of the freeway to the ferry dock was numbered BS I @-@ 196 .

The former routing through Downtown Lansing on Michigan Avenue became part of M @-@ 39 . This was redesignated US 16 in 1926 . With the completion of I @-@ 96 in between Lansing and Brighton , US 16 was decommissioned in Michigan in 1962 . The former routing of US 16 on the north side of Lansing was redesignated as BL I @-@ 96 . Through downtown , it followed the former US 27 on Larch Street . There , BL I @-@ 96 joined US 27 along a one @-@ way pairing of Larch and Cedar streets . Where US 27 turned to join M @-@ 78 at Main Street , BL I @-@ 96 continued along US 127 along Cedar Street to terminate at I @-@ 96 south of the city at exit 104 . In 1963 , BL I @-@ 96 was rerouted onto the first portion of the I @-@ 496 freeway to be constructed southeast of the city . This rerouting would last until 1966 when it was transferred back to the original routing with the completion of the US 127 freeway between Lansing and Mason . BL I @-@ 96 was rerouted along M @-@ 43 / Bus . M @-@ 78 to the I @-@ 496 / M @-@ 78 freeway and back to I @-@ 96 at exit 106 . Once the US 127 freeway was completed , BL I @-@ 96 was rerouted back along the former US 127 routing to I @-@ 96 .

 When the state highway system was first signposted in 1919 , the east – west highway across the Lower Peninsula through Lansing to Detroit was assigned the M @-@ 16 designation . This highway was the original route of US 16 though downtown Farmington . In 1933 , US 16 was routed onto a bypass route which had been constructed south of the city ( the present @-@ day Freedom Road ) and the route through Farmington was retained as state trunkline . In 1956 , a new bypass freeway was built just to the south of the old bypass as part of the Brighton – Farmington Expressway and the route through downtown was designated Business US 16 . ( Bus . US 16 ) 
 The original plans for I @-@ 96 called for it to replace US 16 and to run parallel to Grand River Avenue all the way from Farmington into downtown Detroit . In 1959 , the Farmington bypass freeway was given the I @-@ 96 designation in addition to the US 16 moniker , and the business route was redesignated as BL I @-@ 96 two years later .

 = Invincible ( Michael Jackson album ) = 
 Invincible is the final studio album by American recording artist Michael Jackson . It is his sixth studio album released through Epic Records and his tenth studio album overall . It was released on October 30 , 2001 . Similar to Jackson 's previous material , Invincible explores themes such as love , romance , isolation , media criticism , and social issues . 
 The album peaked at number one in eleven territories worldwide , including the United States ( with first @-@ week sales of 363 @,@ 000 units ) , the United Kingdom , Australia , France and Switzerland . Invincible charted within the top ten in six other territories ; its least successful charting area was Mexico , where the album peaked at number 29 . Total sales for the album are estimated to be at 10 million copies . Upon release , the album received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics . 
 = = Background = = 
 During Jackson 's time as a member of The Jackson 5 , he frequently wrote material for the group and began working on projects as a solo artist , which eventually led to recording his own studio albums , notably Thriller ( 1982 ) and Bad ( 1987 ) . The success of Thriller , which still holds its place as the best selling album of all time with a reported 110 million units sold , often over @-@ shadowed Jackson 's other projects . Prior to the release of Invincible , Jackson had not released any new material since Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix in 1997 , or a studio album since HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I in 1995 . Invincible was thus looked at as Jackson 's ' career come back ' . 
 Invincible is dedicated to the fifteen @-@ year @-@ old Afro @-@ Norwegian boy Benjamin " Benny " Hermansen who was stabbed to death by a group of neo @-@ Nazis in Oslo , Norway , in January 2001 . The reason for this tribute was partly due to the fact that another Oslo youth , Omer Bhatti , Jackson 's friend , was also a good friend of Hermansen . The dedication in the album reads , " Michael Jackson gives ' special thanks ' : This album is dedicated to Benjamin ' Benny ' Hermansen . May we continue to remember not to judge man by the color of his skin , but the content of his Character . Benjamin ... we love you ... may you rest in peace . " The album is also dedicated to <unk> <unk> and his parents Joseph and Katherine Jackson . 
 = = Production = = 
 Jackson began recording new material for the album in October 1997 , and finished with " You Are My Life " being recorded only eight weeks before the album 's release in October 2001 - the most extensive recording of Jackson 's career . The tracks with Rodney Jerkins were recorded at The Hit Factory in Miami , Florida . Jackson had shown interest in including a rapper on at least one song , and had noted that he did not want a ' known rapper ' . Jackson 's spokesperson suggested New Jersey rapper named Fats ; after Jackson heard the finished product of the song , the two agreed to record another song together for the album . Rodney Jerkins stated that Jackson was looking to record material in a different musical direction than his previous work , describing the new direction as " edgier " . Jackson received credit for both writing and producing a majority of the songs on Invincible . Aside from Jackson , the album features productions by Jerkins , Teddy Riley , Andre Harris , <unk> " Fanatic " Heard , Kenneth " Babyface " Edmonds , R. Kelly and Dr. Freeze Bill Gray and writing credits from Kelly , Fred Jerkins III , LaShawn Daniels , Nora Payne and Robert Smith . The album is the third collaboration between Jackson and Riley , the other two being Dangerous and Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix . Invincible is Jackson 's tenth and final studio album to have been recorded and released . It was reported that it cost thirty million dollars to make the album , making it the most expensive album ever made . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Invincible is composed of R & B , hip hop , dance @-@ pop , adult contemporary and urban songs . The album 's full length is seventy @-@ seven minutes eight seconds , and it contains 16 songs - fifteen of which were written ( or co @-@ written ) by Jackson . It was noted that the album shifts between aggressive songs and ballads . Invincible opens with " Unbreakable " ; the last line in the first verse recites the lyrics , " With all that I 've been through / I 'm still around " . In a 2002 interview with the magazine Vibe , Jackson commented on his inspiration for writing " Speechless " , saying 
 You 'll be surprised . I was with these kids in Germany , and we had a big water @-@ balloon fight - I 'm serious - and I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote " Speechless " . Fun inspires me . I hate to say that , because it 's such a romantic song . But it was the fight that did it . I was happy , and I wrote it in it 's [ sic ] entirety right there . I felt it would be good enough for the album . Out of the bliss comes magic , wonderment , and creativity . 
 " Privacy " , a reflection on Jackson 's own personal experiences , is about media invasions and tabloid inaccuracies . " The Lost Children " is about imperiled children . Jackson sings in a third person in " Whatever Happens " . The song 's lyrics , described by Rolling Stone magazine as having a " jagged intensity " , narrate the story of two people involved in an unnamed threatening situation . Invincible features four ballads : " You Are My Life " , " Butterflies " , " Don 't Walk Away " and " Cry " . " Cry " , similar to Jackson 's " Man in the Mirror " , is about healing the world together . The lyrics to " Butterflies " and " Break of Dawn " were viewed as " glaringly banal " and it was implied that they could have been written by anyone . " Threatened " was viewed as being a story teller . The song was viewed as a " Thriller redux " . The song " You Are My Life " is about Jackson 's two children at the time , Prince and Paris . The song features Jackson singing , " You are the sun , you make me shine , more like the stars . " 
 = = Promotion and singles = = 
 It was reported that the album had a budget of twenty five million dollars set aside for promotion . Despite this , however , due to the conflicts between Jackson and his record label , little was done to promote the album . The album spawned three singles , although all were given limited releases . " You Rock My World " was only released to radio airplay in the United States , consequently only peaking at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 . Internationally , where it was released as a commercial single , it was more successful , peaking at number one in France , number two in Norway , Finland , Denmark , Belgium and the United Kingdom , number three in Italy , number four in Australia , and five in Sweden and Switzerland . The second single , " Cry " , was not released in the United States . It was only moderately successful , with the song 's most successful territories being Spain , Denmark , France and Belgium , charting at number six , sixteen , thirty and thirty one . 
 The album 's third single , " Butterflies " , was only released in the United States to radio airplay , consequently only peaking at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number two for five weeks on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Singles Chart . " Heaven Can Wait " also charted at the bottom of the R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Charts , at number seventy two due to radio airplay without an official release ; the song did not chart internationally . " Unbreakable " was originally supposed to be released as a single , but it was ultimately cancelled . It was however , later included on The Ultimate Collection box set . 
 Unlike with most of Jackson 's adult studio albums , there was no world tour to promote the album ( world tour was cancelled due to conflict between Jackson and his record label ) . There was , however , a special 30th Anniversary celebration at Madison Square Garden in September 2001 to mark Jackson 's 30th year as a solo artist . The singer performed a song from Invincible and marked his first appearance onstage alongside his brothers since The Jacksons ' Victory Tour in 1984 . The show also featured performances by Britney Spears , Mýa , Usher , Whitney Houston , Tamia , ' N Sync , and Slash , among other artists . The show aired on CBS in November 2001 as a two @-@ hour television special and garnered 29 @.@ 8 million viewers . 
 Following Sony 's decision to abruptly end all promotion for the album , Jackson made allegations in July 2002 that Mottola was a " devil " and a " racist " who did not support his African @-@ American artists , but merely used them for his own personal gain . The singer accused Sony and the record industry of racism , deliberately not promoting or actively working against promotion of his album . Sony disputed claims that they had failed to promote Invincible with sufficient energy , maintaining that Jackson refused to tour in the United States . 
 = = Critical and public reception = = 
 Invincible received mixed reviews . At Metacritic , which assigns a high rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received a mixed score of 51 based on 19 reviews . AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that it has a " spark " and " sound better than anything Jackson has done since Dangerous . " Erlewine noted that while the album had good material it was " not enough to make Invincible the comeback Jackson needed - he really would have had to have an album that sounded free instead of constrained for that to work - but it does offer a reminder that he can really craft good pop . " David Browne of Entertainment Weekly , felt that Invincible is Jackson 's " first album since Off the Wall that offers virtually no new twists " but remarked that the album " feels like an anthology of his less @-@ than @-@ greatest hits " . James Hunter of Rolling Stone critiqued that the album 's later ballads made the record too long . Hunter also commented that Jackson and Riley made " Whatever Happens " " something really handsome and smart " , allowing listeners " to concentrate on the track 's momentous rhythms " such as " Santana 's passionate interjections and Lubbock 's wonderfully arranged symphonic sweeps " . Mark Beaumont of NME called it " a relevant and rejuvenated comeback album made overlong " , while Blender also found it " long @-@ winded " . 
 In his review for The Village Voice , Robert Christgau said that Jackson 's skills as a musician are often forgotten , but noted that the album seemed too long compared to other Jackson albums . While Christgau felt some material was " offensive " , he described the album 's first three tracks as being the " Rodney Jerkins of the year " adding that he did not " believe the [ album 's ] hype matters " . Nikki Tranter of PopMatters said that it is both innovative and meaningful because exceptional songs such as " The Lost Children " and " Whatever Happens " more than make up for overly sentimental songs like " Heaven Can Wait " and " You Are My Life " . Q magazine said that it is an aurally interesting , albeit inconsistent , album . In a negative review for The New York Times , Jon Pareles suggested that the album is somewhat impersonal and humorless , as Jackson rehashes ideas from his past songs and is " so busy trying to dazzle listeners that he forgets to have any fun . " In a retrospective review for The Rolling Stone Album Guide , Pareles said that Invincible showed Jackson had lost his suave quality to " grim calculation " . 
 Shortly after the release of the album , in a poll conducted by Billboard magazine , " an overwhelming majority " of people — 79 % of 5 @,@ 195 voters — were not surprised by Invincible entering the Billboard 200 at number one . Billboard also reported that 44 % agreed with the statement , proclaiming that Jackson was " still the King of Pop " . Another 35 % said they were not surprised by the album 's ranking , but doubted Invincible would hold on for a second week at the top of the chart . Only 12 % of people who responded to the poll said they were surprised by the album 's charting debut because of Jackson 's career over past six years and another 9 % were taken aback by the album 's success , in light of the negativity that preceded the album 's release . Invincible received one Grammy Award nomination at the 2002 ceremony . The album 's song " You Rock My World " was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male , but lost to James Taylor 's " Don 't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight " . Due to the album 's release in October 2001 , it was not eligible for any other nomination from the 2002 Grammy Awards . In December 2009 , ( just a few months after Jackson 's death ) readers of Billboard magazine voted Invincible as the best album of the decade , from their readers poll . 
 = = Commercial performance = = 
 Invincible was Jackson 's first studio album to be released in four years , since Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix in 1997 . In the album 's first week of release , with the sales of 363 @,@ 000 units , the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 on the charts issue date of November 17 , 2001 . Invincible was Jackson 's fifth number one entry on the Billboard 200 , and the fourth to chart at number one in its debut week as a solo artist . Despite the first week sales of Invincible being good , the album sold less than HIStory in its opening week , with the album having sold 391 @,@ 000 units . Invincible also charted at number one on Billboards R & B / Hip Hop Albums Chart for four weeks . After eight weeks of release , in December 2001 , Invincible was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for the sales of five hundred thousand units . In the same month the album was certified platinum for the sale of one million units . On January 25 , 2002 , the album was certified two times platinum for the sales of two million units . Some of the songs from Invincible would be used for the Immortal World Tour 
 Internationally , Invincible was a commercial success . The album peaked at number one in twelve countries worldwide , including the United Kingdom , Australia , Belgium , Denmark , The Netherlands , Germany , Norway , Sweden and Switzerland . It also charted within the top ten in several countries , including Austria , Canada , Finland , Italy , New Zealand , and Norway . Mexico was the album 's least successful charting territory , peaking within the top thirty at number twenty nine . The album has reportedly sold 10 million units worldwide . However , the sales for Invincible were notably low compared to his previous releases , due in part to a diminishing pop music industry , the lack of promotion , no supporting world tour and the label dispute . Commenting on the sales of Invincible back in late 2003 , Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald stated : 
 " Holly Valance or Delta Goodrem would think their Christmases had come at once if they sold five or six million copies of their albums worldwide . Michael Jackson did something similar in the past two years with his seventh solo album , Invincible , and he 's been branded a failure in the industry and the media . Unfair ? Yes , of course , because his Invincible figures are better than those for 95 per cent of the thousands of artists released each year and would provide a healthy retirement fund for anyone . What 's more , that failure tag is consistently applied by comparisons with his 1982 album , Thriller , which has sold about 100 million copies and its follow @-@ ups , Bad , that sold about 30 million copies . However , selling 10 million copies is still phenomenal compared to the album sales of most artists . " 
 In 2004 , Invincible re @-@ entered Billboard charts . Invincible placed at 154 on the Billboard 200 on December 4 , 2004 . The album also reached at number forty eight on Billboards R & B / Hip Hop Albums Chart that same week . Following Jackson 's death in June 2009 , his music experienced a surge in popularity . Invincible charted at number twelve on Billboards Digital Albums Chart on July 11 , 2009 . Having not charted on the chart prior to its peak position , the album was listed as the ninth biggest jump on that chart that week . It also charted within the top ten , peaking at number nine , on Billboard 's Catalog Albums Chart on the issue date of July 18 . On the week of July 19 , 2009 , Invincible charted at number eighteen in Italy . Invincible peaked at number sixty four on the European Albums Chart on the charts issue date of July 25 . The album also charted at number twenty nine in Mexico in July , and eighty four on the Swiss Albums Chart on July 19 , 2009 .

 = Boeing 767 = 
 The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large @-@ size , long @-@ range , wide @-@ body twin @-@ engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes . It was Boeing 's first wide @-@ body twinjet and its first airliner with a two @-@ crew glass cockpit . The aircraft has two turbofan engines , a conventional tail , and , for reduced aerodynamic drag , a supercritical wing design . Designed as a smaller wide @-@ body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the 747 , the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people , and a design range of 3 @,@ 850 to 6 @,@ 385 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 130 to 11 @,@ 825 km ) , depending on variant . Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow @-@ body twinjet , the 757 , resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft . 
 The 767 is produced in three fuselage lengths . The original 767 @-@ 200 entered service in 1982 , followed by the 767 @-@ 300 in 1986 and the 767 @-@ 400ER , an extended @-@ range ( ER ) variant , in 2000 . The extended @-@ range 767 @-@ 200ER and 767 @-@ 300ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988 , respectively , while a production freighter version , the 767 @-@ 300F , debuted in 1995 . Conversion programs have modified passenger 767 @-@ 200 and 767 @-@ 300 series aircraft for cargo use , while military derivatives include the E @-@ 767 surveillance aircraft , the KC @-@ 767 and KC @-@ 46 aerial tankers , and VIP transports . Engines featured on the 767 include the General Electric CF6 , Pratt & Whitney JT9D and PW4000 , and Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 turbofans . 
 United Airlines first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982 . The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes , during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design . In 1985 , the 767 became the first twin @-@ engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights . The aircraft was then used to expand non @-@ stop service on medium- to long @-@ haul intercontinental routes . In 1986 , Boeing initiated studies for a higher @-@ capacity 767 , ultimately leading to the development of the 777 , a larger wide @-@ body twinjet . In the 1990s , the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe . 
 The 767 is the first twinjet wide @-@ body type to reach 1 @,@ 000 aircraft delivered . As of June 2016 , Boeing has received 1 @,@ 170 orders for the 767 from 74 customers ; 1 @,@ 088 have been delivered . A total of 765 of these aircraft were in service in July 2015 ; the most popular variant is the 767 @-@ 300ER , with 583 delivered ; Delta Air Lines is the largest operator , with 95 aircraft . Competitors have included the Airbus A300 , A310 , and A330 @-@ 200 , while a successor , the 787 Dreamliner , entered service in October 2011 . Despite this , the 767 still remains in production .

 In 1970 , Boeing 's 747 became the first wide @-@ body jetliner to enter service . The 747 was the first passenger jet that was wide enough to feature a twin @-@ aisle cabin . Two years later , the manufacturer began a development study , code @-@ named 7X7 , for a new wide @-@ body aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow @-@ body jets . The aircraft would also provide twin @-@ aisle seating , but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747 , McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10 , and Lockheed L @-@ 1011 TriStar wide @-@ bodies . To defray the high cost of development , Boeing signed risk @-@ sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation ( CTDC ) , a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies . This marked the manufacturer 's first major international joint venture , and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation . The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take @-@ off and landing airliner intended for short @-@ distance flights , but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept , leading to its redefinition as a mid @-@ size , transcontinental @-@ range airliner . At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines , with possible configurations including over @-@ wing engines and a T @-@ tail . 
 By 1976 , a twinjet layout , similar to the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300 , became the baseline configuration . The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new @-@ generation jet powerplants . While airline requirements for new wide @-@ body aircraft remained ambiguous , the 7X7 was generally focused on mid @-@ size , high @-@ density markets . As such , it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities . Advancements in civil aerospace technology , including high @-@ bypass @-@ ratio turbofan engines , new flight deck systems , aerodynamic improvements , and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7 . Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid @-@ size narrow @-@ body airliner , code @-@ named 7N7 , which would become the 757 . Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s . 
 In January 1978 , Boeing announced a major extension of its Everett factory — which was then dedicated to the manufacture of the 747 — to accommodate its new wide @-@ body family . In February 1978 , the new jetliner received the 767 model designation , and three variants were planned : a 767 @-@ 100 with 190 seats , a 767 @-@ 200 with 210 seats , and a trijet <unk> / LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes . The <unk> / LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes . The 767 was officially launched on July 14 , 1978 , when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767 @-@ 200 variant , followed by 50 more 767 @-@ 200 orders from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines later that year . The 767 @-@ 100 was ultimately not offered for sale , as its capacity was too close to the 757 's seating , while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration . 
 = = = Design effort = = = 
 In the late 1970s , operating cost replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases . As a result , the 767 's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset . Boeing targeted a 20 to 30 percent cost saving over earlier aircraft , mainly through new engine and wing technology . As development progressed , engineers used computer @-@ aided design for over one @-@ third of the 767 's design drawings , and performed 26 @,@ 000 hours of wind tunnel tests . Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet , leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost . Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features , including avionics , flight management systems , instruments , and handling characteristics . Combined development costs were estimated at $ 3 @.@ 5 to $ 4 billion . 
 Early 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt & Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans , marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner . Both jet engine models had a maximum output of 48 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ( 210 kN ) of thrust . The engines were mounted approximately one @-@ third the length of the wing from the fuselage , similar to previous wide @-@ body trijets . The larger wings were designed using an aft @-@ loaded shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed lift more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer 's previous aircraft . The wings provided higher @-@ altitude cruise performance , added fuel capacity , and expansion room for future stretched variants . The initial 767 @-@ 200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic , and would be capable of operating routes up to 3 @,@ 850 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 130 km ) . 
 The 767 's fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at 16 @.@ 5 feet ( 5 @.@ 03 m ) . While it was narrower than previous wide @-@ body designs , seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted , and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag . However , the fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard <unk> wide @-@ body unit load devices side @-@ by @-@ side . As a result , a smaller container , the <unk> , was created specifically for the 767 . The adoption of a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section , providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin , and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft . 
 The 767 was the first Boeing wide @-@ body to be designed with a two @-@ crew digital glass cockpit . Cathode ray tube ( CRT ) color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co @-@ pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly . Despite the promise of reduced crew costs , United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three @-@ person cockpit , citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft . The carrier maintained this position until July 1981 , when a U.S. presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide @-@ body jets . A three @-@ crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models . Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three @-@ crew cockpits due to union demands ; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured . The 767 's two @-@ crew cockpit was also applied to the 757 , allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course , and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types . 
 = = = Production and testing = = = 
 To produce the 767 , Boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy 's Aeritalia and Japan 's CTDC . The wings and cabin floor were produced in @-@ house , while Aeritalia provided control surfaces , Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings , and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage . The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies , namely Fuji Heavy Industries ( wing fairings and gear doors ) , Kawasaki Heavy Industries ( center fuselage ) , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries ( rear fuselage , doors , and tail ) . Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory . For expedited production of wing spars , the main structural member of aircraft wings , the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners . This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747 . Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979 . 
 The prototype aircraft , registered <unk> and equipped with JT9D turbofans , rolled out on August 4 , 1981 . By this time , the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers , including Air Canada , All Nippon Airways , Britannia Airways , <unk> , and Trans World Airlines ( TWA ) . On September 26 , 1981 , the prototype took its maiden flight under the command of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds , Lew Wallick , and John Brit . The maiden flight was largely uneventful , save for the inability to retract the landing gear because of a hydraulic fluid leak . The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests . 
 The 10 @-@ month 767 flight test program utilized the first six aircraft built . The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines , while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines . The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics , flight systems , handling , and performance , while the sixth aircraft was used for route @-@ proving flights . During testing , pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly , with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide @-@ body jets . Following the successful completion of 1 @,@ 600 hours of flight tests , the JT9D @-@ powered 767 @-@ 200 received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) in July 1982 . The first delivery occurred on August 19 , 1982 , to United Airlines . The CF6 @-@ powered 767 @-@ 200 received certification in September 1982 , followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25 , 1982 . 
 = = = Service entry and operations = = = 
 The 767 entered service with United Airlines on September 8 , 1982 . The aircraft 's first commercial flight used a JT9D @-@ powered 767 @-@ 200 on the Chicago @-@ to @-@ Denver route . The CF6 @-@ powered 767 @-@ 200 commenced service three months later with Delta Air Lines . Upon delivery , early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes , including U.S. transcontinental services . American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767 @-@ 200 in late 1982 , while Air Canada , China Airlines , and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983 . The aircraft 's introduction was relatively smooth , with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners . In its first year , the 767 logged a 96 @.@ 1 percent rate of takeoff without delay due to technical issues , which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft . Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet 's sound levels , interior comfort , and economic performance . Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings , the replacement of an evacuation slide latch , and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications . 
 Seeking to capitalize on its new wide @-@ body 's potential for growth , Boeing offered an extended @-@ range model , the 767 @-@ 200ER , in its first year of service . Ethiopian Airlines placed the first order for the type in December 1982 . Featuring increased gross weight specifications and greater fuel capacity , the extended @-@ range model could carry heavier payloads at distances up to 6 @,@ 385 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 825 km ) , and was targeted at overseas customers . The 767 @-@ 200ER entered service with El Al on March 27 , 1984 . The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium @-@ traffic , long @-@ distance flights . 
 In the mid @-@ 1980s , the 767 spearheaded the growth of twinjet flights across the northern Atlantic under extended @-@ range twin @-@ engine operational performance standards ( ETOPS ) regulations , the FAA 's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines . Before the 767 , over @-@ water flight paths of twinjets could be no more than 90 minutes away from diversion airports . In May 1985 , the FAA granted its first approval for 120 @-@ minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators , on an individual airline basis starting with TWA , provided that the operator met flight safety criteria . This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours ' distance from land . The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines . The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6 @-@ powered 767s in 1989 , making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration , and all available engines received approval by 1993 . Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft 's sales .

 Forecasting airline interest in larger @-@ capacity models , Boeing announced the stretched 767 @-@ 300 in 1983 and the extended @-@ range 767 @-@ 300ER in 1984 . Both models offered a 20 percent passenger capacity increase , while the extended @-@ range version was capable of operating flights up to 5 @,@ 990 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 090 km ) . Japan Airlines placed the first order for the 767 @-@ 300 in September 1983 . Following its first flight on January 30 , 1986 , the type entered service with Japan Airlines on October 20 , 1986 . The 767 @-@ 300ER completed its first flight on December 9 , 1986 , but it was not until March 1987 that the first firm order , from American Airlines , was placed . The type entered service with American Airlines on March 3 , 1988 . The 767 @-@ 300 and 767 @-@ 300ER gained popularity after entering service , and came to account for approximately two @-@ thirds of all 767s sold . 
 After the debut of the first stretched 767s , Boeing sought to address airline requests for even more capacity by proposing larger models , including a partial double @-@ deck version informally named the " Hunchback of Mukilteo " ( from a town near Boeing 's Everett factory ) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage . In 1986 , the manufacturer announced the 767 @-@ X , a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin , but received little interest . By 1988 , the 767 @-@ X had evolved into an all @-@ new twinjet , which revived the 777 designation . Until the 777 's 1995 debut , the 767 @-@ 300 and 767 @-@ 300ER remained Boeing 's second @-@ largest wide @-@ bodies behind the 747 . 
 Buoyed by a recovering global economy and ETOPS approval , 767 sales accelerated in the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1980s , with 1989 being the most prolific year with 132 firm orders . By the early 1990s , the wide @-@ body twinjet had become its manufacturer 's annual best @-@ selling aircraft , despite a slight decrease due to economic recession . During this period , the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe . By the end of the decade , 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined . The 767 also propelled the growth of point @-@ to @-@ point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes . Taking advantage of the aircraft 's lower operating costs and smaller capacity , operators added non @-@ stop flights to secondary population centers , thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights . The increase in the number of cities receiving non @-@ stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point @-@ to @-@ point travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional hub @-@ and @-@ spoke model . 
 In February 1990 , the first 767 equipped with Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 turbofans , a 767 @-@ 300 , was delivered to British Airways . Six months later , the carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in the engine pylons of several aircraft . The cracks were related to the extra weight of the RB211 engines , which are 2 @,@ 205 pounds ( 1 @,@ 000 kg ) heavier than other 767 engines . During the grounding , interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components , and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks . Boeing also performed a structural reassessment , resulting in production changes and modifications to the engine pylons of all 767s in service . 
 In January 1993 , following an order from UPS Airlines , Boeing launched a freighter variant , the 767 @-@ 300F , which entered service with UPS on October 16 , 1995 . The 767 @-@ 300F featured a main deck cargo hold , upgraded landing gear , and strengthened wing structure . In November 1993 , the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the E @-@ 767 , an Airborne Early Warning and Control ( AWACS ) variant based on the 767 @-@ 200ER . The first two E @-@ 767s , featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance radar and other monitoring equipment , were delivered in 1998 to the Japan Self @-@ Defense Forces . 
 In November 1995 , after abandoning development of a smaller version of the 777 , Boeing announced that it was revisiting studies for a larger 767 . The proposed 767 @-@ <unk> , a second stretch of the aircraft , offered an over 12 percent capacity increase versus the 767 @-@ 300 , and featured an upgraded flight deck , enhanced interior , and wider wingspan . The variant was specifically aimed at Delta Air Lines ' pending replacement of its aging Lockheed L @-@ 1011 TriStars , and faced competition from the A330 @-@ 200 , a shortened derivative of the Airbus A330 . In March 1997 , Delta Air Lines launched the 767 @-@ 400ER when it ordered the type to replace its L @-@ 1011 fleet . In October 1997 , Continental Airlines also ordered the 767 @-@ 400ER to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10 fleet . The type completed its first flight on October 9 , 1999 , and entered service with Continental Airlines on September 14 , 2000 .

 In the early 2000s , cumulative 767 deliveries approached 900 , but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn . In 2001 , Boeing dropped plans for a longer @-@ range model , the 767 @-@ 400ERX , in favor of the proposed Sonic Cruiser , a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15 percent faster while having comparable fuel costs as the 767 . The following year , the manufacturer announced the KC @-@ 767 Tanker Transport , a second military derivative of the 767 @-@ 200ER . Launched with an order in October 2002 from the Italian Air Force , the KC @-@ 767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo . The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003 . In May 2003 , the United States Air Force ( USAF ) announced its intent to lease KC @-@ 767s to replace its aging KC @-@ 135 tankers . The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal , resulting in multiple U.S. government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials , including Philip Condit , the company 's chief executive officer , and chief financial officer Michael Sears . The first KC @-@ 767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self @-@ Defense Forces . 
 In late 2002 , after airlines expressed reservations about its emphasis on speed over cost reduction , Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser . The following year , the manufacturer announced the 7E7 , a mid @-@ size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20 percent more fuel efficient . The new jetliner was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project . Customers embraced the 7E7 , later renamed 787 Dreamliner , and within two years it had become the fastest @-@ selling airliner in the company 's history . In 2005 , Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales , citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option . Subsequently , the 767 @-@ 300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays , including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines . Some aging 767s , exceeding 20 years in age , were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays . To extend the operational lives of older aircraft , airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures , including D @-@ check <unk> and inspections for corrosion , a recurring issue on aging 767s . The first 787s would ultimately enter service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011 , three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years behind schedule . 
 In 2007 , the 767 received a production boost when UPS and DHL Aviation placed a combined 33 orders for the 767 @-@ 300F . Renewed freighter interest led Boeing to consider enhanced versions of the 767 @-@ 200 and 767 @-@ 300F with increased gross weights , 767 @-@ 400ER wing extensions , and 777 avionics . However , net orders for the 767 declined from 24 in 2008 to just three in 2010 . During the same period , operators upgraded aircraft already in service ; in 2008 , the first 767 @-@ 300ER retrofitted with blended winglets from Aviation Partners Incorporated debuted with American Airlines . The manufacturer @-@ sanctioned winglets , at 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 35 m ) in height , improved fuel efficiency by an estimated 6 @.@ 5 percent . Other carriers including All Nippon Airways and Delta Air Lines also ordered winglet kits . 
 On February 2 , 2011 , the 1,000th 767 rolled out , destined for All Nippon Airways . The aircraft was the 91st 767 @-@ 300ER ordered by the Japanese carrier , and with its completion the 767 became the second wide @-@ body airliner to reach the thousand @-@ unit milestone after the 747 . The 1,000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line . Beginning with the <unk> aircraft , production moved to another area in the Everett factory which occupied nearly half the space as before . The new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost manufacturing efficiency by over 20 percent . 
 At the inauguration of its new assembly line , the 767 's order backlog numbered approximately 50 , only enough for production to last until 2013 . Despite the reduced backlog , Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders were forthcoming . On February 24 , 2011 , the USAF announced its selection of the KC @-@ 767 Advanced Tanker , an upgraded variant of the KC @-@ 767 , for its KC @-@ X fleet renewal program . The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS , and came eight years after the USAF 's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC @-@ 767s . The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013 . 
 In December 2011 , FedEx Express announced a 767 @-@ 300F order for 27 aircraft to replace its DC @-@ 10 freighters , citing the USAF tanker order and Boeing 's decision to continue production as contributing factors . FedEx Express announced an agreement to buy an additional 19 of the − 300F variant in June 2012 . In June 2015 , FedEx said it was accelerating retirements of planes both to reflect demand and to modernize its fleet , recording charges of $ 276 million . On July 21 , 2015 FedEx announced an order for 50 767 @-@ 300F with options on another 50 , the largest order for the type . FedEx confirmed that it has firm orders for 106 of the freighters for delivery between 2018 and 2023 .

 The 767 is a low @-@ wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder . The wings are swept at 31 @.@ 5 degrees and optimized for a cruising speed of Mach 0 @.@ 8 ( 533 mph or 858 km / h ) . Each wing features a supercritical cross @-@ section and is equipped with six @-@ panel leading edge slats , single- and double @-@ slotted flaps , inboard and outboard ailerons , and six spoilers . The airframe further incorporates Carbon @-@ fiber @-@ reinforced polymer composite material wing surfaces , Kevlar fairings and access panels , plus improved aluminum alloys , which together reduce overall weight by 1 @,@ 900 pounds ( 860 kg ) versus preceding aircraft . 
 To distribute the aircraft 's weight on the ground , the 767 has a retractable tricycle landing gear with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear . The original wing and gear design accommodated the stretched 767 @-@ 300 without major changes . The 767 @-@ 400ER features a larger , more widely spaced main gear with 777 wheels , tires , and brakes . To prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff , 767 @-@ 300 and 767 @-@ 400ER models are fitted with a retractable tailskid . The 767 has exit doors near the front and rear of the aircraft on the left side . 
 In addition to shared avionics and computer technology , the 767 uses the same auxiliary power unit , electric power systems , and hydraulic parts as the 757 . A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles . Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft . 
 = = = Flight systems = = = 
 The original 767 flight deck uses six Rockwell Collins CRT screens to display Electronic flight instrument system ( EFIS ) and engine indication and crew alerting system ( EICAS ) information , allowing pilots to handle monitoring tasks previously performed by the flight engineer . The CRTs replace conventional electromechanical instruments found on earlier aircraft . An enhanced flight management system , improved over versions used on early 747s , automates navigation and other functions , while an automatic landing system facilitates CAT IIIb instrument landings in low visibility situations . The 767 became the first aircraft to receive CAT IIIb certification from the FAA for landings with 980 feet ( 300 m ) minimum visibility in 1984 . On the 767 @-@ 400ER , the cockpit layout is simplified further with six Rockwell Collins liquid crystal display ( LCD ) screens , and adapted for similarities with the 777 and the Next Generation 737 . To retain operational commonality , the LCD screens can be programmed to display information in the same manner as earlier 767s . In 2012 , Boeing and Rockwell Collins launched a further 787 @-@ based cockpit upgrade for the 767 , featuring three landscape @-@ format LCD screens that can display two windows each . 
 The 767 is equipped with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces , landing gear , and other equipment . Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system , and the third system uses electric pumps . A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for basic controls in the event of an emergency . An early form of fly @-@ by @-@ wire is employed for spoiler operation , utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables . The fly @-@ by @-@ wire system reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The 767 features a twin @-@ aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy . The standard seven abreast , 2 – 3 – 2 economy class layout places approximately 87 percent of all seats at a window or aisle . As a result , the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats need to be filled , and each passenger is no more than one seat from the aisle . It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration , but this results in a cramped cabin and is therefore uncommon . 
 The 767 interior introduced larger overhead bins and more lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft . The bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding , and strengthened for heavier carry @-@ on items . A single , large galley is installed near the aft doors , allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler resupply while at airports . Passenger and service doors are an overhead plug type , which retract upwards , and commonly used doors can be equipped with an electric @-@ assist system . 
 In 2000 , a 777 @-@ style interior , known as the Boeing Signature Interior , debuted on the 767 @-@ 400ER . Subsequently adopted for all new @-@ build 767s , the Signature Interior features even larger overhead bins , indirect lighting , and sculpted , curved panels . The 767 @-@ 400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777 . Older 767s can be retrofitted with the Signature Interior . Some operators have adopted a simpler modification known as the Enhanced Interior , featuring curved ceiling panels and indirect lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture , as well as aftermarket modifications such as the <unk> 767 package by Heath <unk> . 
 = = Variants = = 
 The 767 has been produced in three fuselage lengths . These debuted in progressively larger form as the 767 @-@ 200 , 767 @-@ 300 , and 767 @-@ 400ER , respectively . Longer @-@ range variants include the 767 @-@ 200ER and 767 @-@ 300ER , while cargo models include the 767 @-@ 300F , a production freighter , and conversions of passenger 767 @-@ 200 and 767 @-@ 300 models . 
 When referring to different variants , Boeing and airlines often collapse the model number ( 767 ) and the variant designator ( e.g. – 200 or – 300 ) into a truncated form ( e.g. " 762 " or " 763 " ) . Subsequent to the capacity number , designations may or may not append the range identifier . The International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) aircraft type designator system uses a similar numbering scheme , but adds a preceding manufacturer letter ; all variants based on the 767 @-@ 200 and 767 @-@ 300 are classified under the codes " <unk> " and " <unk> " , respectively , while the 767 @-@ 400ER receives the designation of " <unk> . " 
 = = = 767 @-@ 200 = = = 
 The 767 @-@ 200 was the original model and entered service with United Airlines in 1982 . The type has been used primarily by mainline U.S. carriers for domestic routes between major hub centers such as Los Angeles to Washington . The 767 @-@ 200 was the first aircraft to be used on transatlantic ETOPS flights , beginning with TWA on February 1 , 1985 under 90 @-@ minute diversion rules . Deliveries for the variant totaled 128 aircraft . There were 49 passenger and freighter conversions of the model in commercial service as of July 2015 . The type 's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310 . 
 The 767 @-@ 200 ceased production in the late 1980s due to being superseded by the extended @-@ range 767 @-@ 200ER . Some early 767 @-@ 200s were subsequently upgraded to extended @-@ range specification . In 1998 , Boeing began offering 767 @-@ 200 conversions to 767 @-@ 200SF ( Special Freighter ) specification for cargo use , and Israel Aerospace Industries has been licensed to perform cargo conversions since 2005 . The conversion process entails the installation of a side cargo door , strengthened main deck floor , and added freight monitoring and safety equipment . The 767 @-@ 200SF was positioned as a replacement for Douglas DC @-@ 8 freighters . 
 = = = 767 @-@ 2C = = = 
 A commercial freighter version of the Boeing 767 @-@ 200 with series 300 wings and an updated <unk> was first flown on 29 December 2014 . A military tanker variant of the Boeing 767 @-@ 2C is being developed for the U.S. Air Force as the KC @-@ 46 . Boeing is building two aircraft as commercial freighters which will be used to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification , a further two Boeing 767 @-@ 2Cs will be modified as military tankers . As of 2014 , Boeing does not have customers for the freighter . 
 = = = 767 @-@ 200ER = = = 
 The 767 @-@ 200ER was the first extended @-@ range model and entered service with El Al in 1984 . The type 's increased range is due to an additional center fuel tank and a higher maximum takeoff weight ( MTOW ) of up to 395 @,@ 000 lb ( 179 @,@ 000 kg ) . The type was originally offered with the same engines as the 767 @-@ 200 , while more powerful Pratt & Whitney PW4000 and General Electric CF6 engines later became available . The 767 @-@ 200ER was the first 767 to complete a non @-@ stop transatlantic journey , and broke the flying distance record for a twinjet airliner on April 17 , 1988 with an Air Mauritius flight from Halifax , Nova Scotia to Port Louis , Mauritius , covering a distance of 8 @,@ 727 nmi ( 10 @,@ 000 mi ; 16 @,@ 200 km ) . The 767 @-@ 200ER has been acquired by international operators seeking smaller wide @-@ body aircraft for long @-@ haul routes such as New York to Beijing . Deliveries of the type totaled 121 with no unfilled orders . As of July 2015 , 35 examples of passenger and freighter conversion versions were in airline service . The type 's main competitors of the time included the Airbus A300 @-@ <unk> and the A310 @-@ 300 . 
 = = = 767 @-@ 300 = = = 
 The 767 @-@ 300 , the first stretched version of the aircraft , entered service with Japan Airlines in 1986 . The type features a 21 @.@ 1 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 43 m ) fuselage extension over the 767 @-@ 200 , achieved by additional sections inserted before and after the wings , for an overall length of 180 @.@ 25 ft ( 54 @.@ 9 m ) . Reflecting the growth potential built into the original 767 design , the wings , engines , and most systems were largely unchanged on the 767 @-@ 300 . An optional mid @-@ cabin exit door is positioned ahead of the wings on the left , while more powerful Pratt & Whitney PW4000 and Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 engines later became available . The 767 @-@ 300 's increased capacity has been used on high @-@ density routes within Asia and Europe . Deliveries for the type totaled 104 aircraft with no unfilled orders remaining . As of July 2015 , 67 of the variant were in airline service . The type 's main competitor was the Airbus A300 .

 The 767 @-@ 300ER , the extended @-@ range version of the 767 @-@ 300 , entered service with American Airlines in 1988 . The type 's increased range was made possible by greater fuel tankage and a higher MTOW of 407 @,@ 000 lb ( 185 @,@ 000 kg ) . Design improvements allowed the available MTOW to increase to 412 @,@ 000 lb ( 187 @,@ 000 kg ) by 1993 . Power is provided by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 , General Electric CF6 , or Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 engines . Typical routes for the type include Los Angeles to Frankfurt . The combination of increased capacity and range offered by the 767 @-@ 300ER has been particularly attractive to both new and existing 767 operators . It is the most successful version of the aircraft , with more orders placed than all other variants combined . As of June 2016 , 767 @-@ 300ER deliveries stand at 583 with no unfilled orders . There were 467 examples in service as of July 2015 . The type 's main competitor is the Airbus A330 @-@ 200 .

 = = = Military and government = = = 
 Versions of the 767 serve in a number of military and government applications , with responsibilities ranging from airborne surveillance and refueling to cargo and VIP transport . Several military 767s have been derived from the 767 @-@ 200ER , the longest @-@ range version of the aircraft . 
 Airborne Surveillance Testbed – the Airborne Optical Adjunct ( AOA ) was modified from the prototype 767 @-@ 200 for a United States Army program , under a contract signed with the Strategic Air Command in July 1984 . Intended to evaluate the feasibility of using airborne optical sensors to detect and track hostile intercontinental ballistic missiles , the modified aircraft first flew on August 21 , 1987 . Alterations included a large " cupola " or hump which ran along the top of the aircraft from above the cockpit to just behind the trailing edge of the wings , and a pair of ventral fins below the rear fuselage . Inside the cupola was a suite of infrared seekers used for tracking theater ballistic missile launches . The aircraft was later renamed as the Airborne Surveillance Testbed ( AST ) . Following the end of the AST program in 2002 , the aircraft was retired for scrapping . 
 E @-@ 767 – the Airborne Early Warning and Control ( AWACS ) platform for the Japan Self @-@ Defense Forces ; it is essentially the Boeing E @-@ 3 Sentry mission package on a 767 @-@ 200ER platform . E @-@ 767 modifications , completed on 767 @-@ 200ERs flown from the Everett factory to Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in Wichita , Kansas , include structural strengthening to accommodate a dorsal surveillance radar system , engine nacelle alterations , as well as electrical and interior changes . Japan is the operator of four E @-@ 767s . The first E @-@ 767s were delivered in March 1998 . 
 KC @-@ 767 Advanced Tanker – the 767 @-@ 200ER @-@ based aerial tanker developed for the USAF KC @-@ X tanker competition . It is an updated version of the KC @-@ 767 , originally selected as the USAF 's new tanker aircraft in 2003 , designated KC @-@ <unk> , and then dropped amid conflict of interest allegations . The KC @-@ 767 Advanced Tanker is derived from studies for a longer @-@ range cargo version of the 767 @-@ 200ER , and features a fly @-@ by @-@ wire refueling boom , a remote vision refueling system , and a 767 @-@ 400ER @-@ based flight deck with LCD screens and head @-@ up displays . Boeing was awarded the KC @-@ X contract to build a 767 @-@ based tanker , to be designated KC @-@ <unk> , in February 2011 . 
 KC @-@ 767 Tanker Transport – the 767 @-@ 200ER @-@ based aerial refueling platform operated by the Italian Air Force ( Aeronautica Militare ) , and the Japan Self @-@ Defense Forces . Modifications conducted by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems include the addition of a fly @-@ by @-@ wire refueling boom , strengthened flaps , and optional auxiliary fuel tanks , as well as structural reinforcement and modified avionics .

 As of October 2015 , the Boeing 767 has been in 45 aviation occurrences , including 15 hull @-@ loss accidents . Six fatal crashes , including three hijackings , have resulted in a total of 851 occupant fatalities . The airliner 's first fatal crash , Lauda Air Flight 004 , occurred near Bangkok on May 26 , 1991 , following the in @-@ flight deployment of the left engine thrust reverser on a 767 @-@ 300ER ; none of the 223 aboard survived ; as a result of this accident all 767 thrust reversers were deactivated until a redesign was implemented . Investigators determined that an electronically controlled valve , common to late @-@ model Boeing aircraft , was to blame . A new locking device was installed on all affected jetliners , including 767s . On October 31 , 1999 , EgyptAir Flight 990 , a 767 @-@ 300ER , crashed off Nantucket Island , Massachusetts , in international waters killing all 217 people on board . The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) determined the probable cause to be due to a deliberate action by the first officer ; Egypt disputed this conclusion . On April 15 , 2002 , Air China Flight 129 , a 767 @-@ 200ER , crashed into a hill amid inclement weather while trying to land at <unk> International Airport in Busan , South Korea . The crash resulted in the death of 129 of the 166 people on board , and the cause was attributed to pilot error . 
 An early 767 incident was survived by all on board . On July 23 , 1983 , Air Canada Flight 143 , a 767 @-@ 200 , ran out of fuel in @-@ flight and had to glide with both engines out for almost 43 nautical miles ( 80 km ) to an emergency landing at Gimli , Manitoba . The pilots used the aircraft 's ram air turbine to power the hydraulic systems for aerodynamic control . There were no fatalities and only minor injuries . This aircraft was nicknamed " Gimli Glider " after the airport at which it landed . The aircraft , registered C @-@ <unk> , continued flying for Air Canada until its retirement in January 2008 . The aircraft was subsequently scrapped in 2008 . 
 The 767 has been involved in six hijackings , three resulting in loss of life , for a combined total of 282 occupant fatalities . On November 23 , 1996 , Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 , a 767 @-@ 200ER , was hijacked and crash @-@ landed in the Indian Ocean near the Comoros Islands after running out of fuel , killing 125 out of the 175 persons on board ; survivors have been rare among instances of land @-@ based aircraft ditching on water . Two 767s were involved in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 , resulting in the collapse of its two main towers . American Airlines Flight 11 , a 767 @-@ 200ER , crashed into the north tower , killing all 92 people on board , and United Airlines Flight 175 , a 767 @-@ 200 , crashed into the south tower , with the death of all 65 on board . In addition , more than 2 @,@ 600 people were killed in the towers or on the ground . A foiled 2001 shoe bomb plot involving an American Airlines 767 @-@ 300ER resulted in passengers being required to remove their shoes for scanning at U.S. security checkpoints . 
 On November 1 , 2011 , LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16 , a 767 @-@ 300ER , safely landed at Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw , Poland after a mechanical failure of the landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear up . There were no injuries , but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off . At the time of the incident , aviation analysts speculated that it may have been the first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767 's service history . Subsequent investigation however determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft 's primary landing gear extension system , an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker . 
 In January 2014 , the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued a directive that ordered inspections of the elevators on more than 400 767s beginning in March 2014 ; the focus is on fasteners and other parts that can fail and cause the elevators to jam . The issue was first identified in 2000 and has been the subject of several Boeing service bulletins . The inspections and repairs are required to be completed within six years . 
 The aircraft has suffered from multiple occurrences of " uncommanded escape slide inflation ” during maintenance or operations . A number of these incidents involved the slide inflating during flight . In late 2015 , the FAA issued a preliminary directive to address the issue .

 = Ram Narayan = 
 Ram Narayan ( Hindi : <unk> <unk> ; IAST : <unk> <unk> , IPA : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 25 December 1927 ) , often referred to with the title Pandit , is an Indian musician who popularised the bowed instrument sarangi as a solo concert instrument in Hindustani classical music and became the first internationally successful sarangi player . 
 Narayan was born near Udaipur and learned to play the sarangi at an early age . He studied under sarangi players and singers and , as a teenager , worked as a music teacher and travelling musician . All India Radio , Lahore , hired Narayan as an accompanist for vocalists in 1944 . He moved to Delhi following the partition of India in 1947 , but wishing to go beyond accompaniment and frustrated with his supporting role , Narayan moved to Mumbai in 1949 to work in Indian cinema . 
 After an unsuccessful attempt in 1954 , Narayan became a concert solo artist in 1956 , and later gave up accompaniment . He recorded solo albums and began to tour America and Europe in the 1960s . Narayan taught Indian and foreign students and performed , frequently outside India , into the 2000s . He was awarded India 's second highest civilian honour , the Padma Vibhushan , in 2005 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ram Narayan was born on 25 December 1927 in Amber village , near Udaipur in northwestern India . His great @-@ great @-@ grandfather , <unk> Biyavat , was a singer from Amber , and he and Narayan 's great @-@ grandfather , <unk> <unk> Biyavat , sang at the court of the Maharana of Udaipur . Narayan 's grandfather , Har Lalji Biyavat , and father , <unk> Biyavat , were farmers and singers , <unk> played the bowed instrument dilruba , and Narayan 's mother was a music lover . Narayan 's first language was Rajasthani and he learned Hindi and , later , English . At an age of about six , he found a small sarangi left by the family 's Ganga guru , a genealogist , and was taught a fingering technique developed by his father . Narayan 's father taught him , but was worried about the difficulty of playing the sarangi and its association with courtesan music , which gave the instrument a low social status . After a year , Biyavat sought lessons for his son from sarangi player Mehboob Khan of Jaipur , but changed his mind when Khan told him Narayan would have to change his fingering technique . Narayan 's father later encouraged him to leave school and devote himself to playing the sarangi . 
 At about ten years of age , Narayan learned the basics of dhrupad , the oldest genre of Hindustani classical music , by studying and imitating the practice of sarangi player Uday Lal of Udaipur , a student of dhrupad singers <unk> and <unk> <unk> . After Uday Lal died of old age , Narayan met travelling singer Madhav Prasad , originally of Lucknow , who had performed at the court of Maihar . With Prasad , Narayan enacted the ganda <unk> , a traditional ceremony of acceptance between a teacher and his pupil , in which Narayan swore obedience in exchange for being maintained by Prasad . He served Prasad and was taught in khyal , the predominate genre of Hindustani classical music , but returned to Udaipur after four years to teach music school . Prasad later visited Narayan and convinced him to resign his position and dedicate his time to improvement as a musician , although the idea of giving up a steady life was not well received by Narayan 's family . He stayed with Prasad and travelled to several Indian states until Prasad fell ill and advised him to learn from singer Abdul Wahid Khan in Lahore . Following Prasad 's death in Lucknow , Narayan enacted the ganda <unk> with another teacher who gave him lessons , but soon left for Lahore and never performed the ritual again . 
 = = Career = = 
 Narayan travelled to Lahore in 1943 and auditioned for the local All India Radio ( AIR ) station as a singer , but the station 's music producer , <unk> Lal Mattoo , noticed grooves in Narayan 's fingernails : <unk> are played by pressing the fingernails sideways against three playing strings , which strains the nails . Mattoo instead employed Narayan as a sarangi player . Traditionally , the sarangi is supposed to play after the singer and imitate the vocal performance , and play in the space between phrases . Mattoo advised Narayan and helped him contact khyal singer Abdul Wahid Khan , a rigorous teacher under whom Narayan learned four ragas through singing lessons . Narayan was allowed sporadic solo performances on AIR and began to consider a solo career . 
 After the partition of India in 1947 , Narayan moved to Delhi and played at the local AIR station . His work for popular singers increased his repertoire and knowledge of styles . Narayan played with the classical singers Omkarnath Thakur , Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> Shankar Pandit , and he accompanied singer Amir Khan in 1948 , when Khan sang for the first time at AIR Delhi following the partition . As an accompanist for vocalists , Narayan showed his own talent and came to the foreground . Singers of the city complained that he was not a dependable accompanist and too assertive , but he maintained he wanted to keep vocalists in tune and inspire them in a cordial contest . Other tabla ( percussion ) players and singers , including Omkarnath Thakur and <unk> Shankar Pandit , expressed admiration for Narayan 's playing . 
 Narayan became frustrated with his supporting role for vocalists and moved to Mumbai in 1949 to work independently in film music and recording . He recorded three solo 78 rpm gramophone records for the British HMV Group in 1950 and an early ten @-@ inch LP album in Mumbai in 1951 , but the album was not in demand . The Mumbai film industry offered a good salary and obscurity for work that would have lowered his stature among classical musicians . For the next 15 years he played and composed songs for films , including <unk> , Gunga Jumna , <unk> , Kashmir Ki Kali , Milan , Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam , and <unk> . He was considered a desired choice of film music director O. P. Nayyar . 
 Narayan performed in Afghanistan in 1952 and in China in 1954 and was well received in both countries . His first solo concert at a 1954 music festival in the <unk> Jehangir Hall , Mumbai , was cut short when an impatient audience , waiting for performances by famous artists , drove him from the stage . Narayan pondered giving up the sarangi and becoming a singer . He later regained confidence , performed solo for smaller crowds , and was favourably received in his second attempt to play solo for a Mumbai music festival in 1956 . He has since performed at the major music festivals of India . Narayan later gave up accompaniment ; this decision carried a financial risk because interest in solo sarangi was not yet substantial . 
 After sitar player Ravi Shankar successfully performed in Western countries , Narayan followed his example . He recorded solo albums and made his first international tour in 1964 to America and Europe with his older brother Chatur Lal , a tabla player who had toured with Shankar in the 1950s . The European tour included performances in France , Germany , sponsored by the Goethe @-@ Institut , and at the City of London Festival , England . Beginning in the 1960s , Narayan often taught and gave concerts outside of India . On his Western tours he encountered interest in the sarangi because of its similarity to cello and violin . The tabla player Suresh <unk> became a frequent accompanist for Narayan in the late 1960s . Narayan continued to perform and record in India and abroad for the next decades and his recordings appeared on Indian , American , and European labels . During the early 1980s he typically spent months each year visiting Western nations . Narayan performed less frequently in the 2000s and rarely in the 2010s . 
 = = Style = = 
 Narayan 's style is characteristic of Hindustani classical music , but his choice of solo instrument and his background of learning from teachers outside his community are not common for the genre . He has stated that he aims to please the audience and create a feeling of harmony , and expects the audience to reciprocate by reacting to his playing . 
 Narayan 's performances are strung together from the meditative and measured alap ( non @-@ metrical introduction ) and jor ( performance with pulse ) in dhrupad style , followed by a faster and less reserved gat section ( composition with rhythmic pattern provided by the tabla ) in khyal style . He experimented with a style of jhala ( performance with rapid pulse ) developed by Bundu Khan , but considered it more appropriate for plucked instruments and stopped performing it . The gat section includes one or two parts with compositions . When two gats are used , the first one tends to be at a slow or medium tempo , and the second one is faster ; the gats are usually performed in the 16 @-@ beat rhythmic cycle tintal . Narayan often completes performances with ragas associated with thumri ( a popular light classical genre ) , which are referred to as <unk> ( Sanskrit : mixed ) because they allow for additional notes , or with a <unk> ( song based on folk music ) . 
 Narayan practices and teaches using a limited number of <unk> , exercises in a small scale range that are used to prepare playing different numbers of notes per bow . Derived from <unk> are lengthy note patterns called tans , which contain characteristic " melodic shapes " and are used by Narayan for fast playing . He uses his left ( fingering ) hand for runs and to play an extended melodic range , and his right ( bowing ) hand for rhythmic <unk> . Narayan 's fingering technique , his low right hand position , keeping the bow in a close to right angle to the string , and his use of the full bow length are unusual among sarangi players . 
 Narayan is associated with the Kirana gharana ( stylistic school of Kirana ) through Abdul Wahid Khan , but his performance style is not strongly connected to it . Most of Narayan 's compositions are from the singing repertoire of his teachers and were modified and adapted to the sarangi . He has created original compositions and in performance varies those he was taught . Narayan <unk> the creation of new ragas , but developed compound ragas , including those of Nand with Kedar and Kafi with Malhar . 
 Narayan uses a sarangi obtained from Uday Lal and built in Meerut in the 1920s or 1930s in his concerts and recordings . He plays on foreign harp strings to produce a clearer tone . Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument and added a fourth string , but removed it because it hindered playing . In the 1940s , he exchanged gut with steel for the first string and found it easier to play , but reverted to using only gut strings because the steel string altered the sound . 
 = = Contributions and recognition = = 
 Narayan increased the status of the sarangi to that of a modern concert solo instrument , made it known outside of India , and was the first sarangi player with international success , an example later followed by Sultan Khan . Narayan 's simplified fingering technique allows for glide ( <unk> ) and affected the modern sarangi concert style , as aspects of his playing and tone creation were taken up by sarangi players from Narayan 's recordings . 
 Narayan taught at the American Society for Eastern Arts and the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Mumbai in the 1970s and 1980s , where he gave the first master class for sarangi . Narayan privately trained sarangi players , including his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle , his grandson Harsh Narayan , and <unk> <unk> . He also taught sarod players , including his son Brij Narayan , as well as vocalists and a violinist . In 2002 , he taught 15 Indian students and more than 500 students in the United States and Europe had studied with him . Indian music in performance : a practical introduction , released in 1980 by Neil Sorrell in cooperation with Narayan , was described as " one of the best presentations on modern North Indian music practice " by Hans Neuhoff in Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart . 
 Narayan argued that appreciation of the sarangi and him came only after acknowledgment by the Western audience . He attributed the lack of sarangi students to a lack of competent teachers and said that the Indian government should assist in preserving the instrument . The Pt ( Pandit ) Ram Narayan Foundation in Mumbai awards scholarships to sarangi students , but Narayan stated he was skeptical the sarangi would survive . 
 Narayan received the national awards Padma Shri in 1976 , Padma Bhushan in 1991 , and Padma Vibhushan in 2005 . The Padma Vibhushan , India 's second highest civilian honor , was presented by Indian President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam . Narayan was awarded the Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1974 – 75 , the national Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1975 , and was made a fellow of the Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Akademi for 1988 – 89 . He received the Kalidas Samman from the Government of Madhya Pradesh for 1991 – 92 and was presented with the Aditya Vikram Birla <unk> Puraskar in 1999 by P. C. Alexander , governor of Maharashtra . He also received the Maharashtra Gaurav Puraskar , the Shiromani Award , the Rajasthan Welfare Association Award , and in 2013 the Rajasthan Ratna . He was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Honour – Classical at the 4th <unk> Star Global Indian Music Academy ( <unk> ) Awards 2014 . The biographical film Pandit <unk> – Sarangi Ke Sang was shown at the 2007 International Film Festival of India . 
 = = Family and personal life = = 
 Narayan shared a close relationship with his older brother , Chatur Lal , who learned the tabla primarily to accompany his brother 's sarangi playing . Lal studied under tabla teachers in his youth , but later turned to farming . Lal visited Narayan 1948 in Delhi after Narayan had become a professional sarangi player , and Narayan convinced Lal to work as a tabla player at the local AIR station . Lal became an acclaimed musician , toured with instrumentalists Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan in the 1950s , and helped popularise the tabla in Western countries . When Lal died in October 1965 , Narayan had difficulty performing and struggled with alcoholism , but overcame the addiction after two years . Narayan assisted his brother 's four children after their father 's death . Chatur Lal 's son , <unk> Lal Biyavat , is a tabla player and has toured Europe with Narayan . 
 Narayan 's wife Sheela , a homemaker , came to Mumbai in the 1950s and they had four children . She died prior to 2001 . His oldest son , sarod player Brij Narayan , was born on 25 April 1952 in Udaipur , and his daughter Aruna Narayan was born in 1959 in Mumbai . She was the first woman to give a solo sarangi concert and immigrated to Canada in 1984 .

 Lincolnshire is a village in Vernon Township , Lake County , in the U.S. state of Illinois . The village is a northern suburb of Chicago . The population of Lincolnshire was 7 @,@ 275 at the 2010 census . Lincolnshire was incorporated on August 5 , 1957 , from the unincorporated Half Day area when land was purchased to build a residential subdivision . The community underwent an aggressive era of expansion from 1983 to the 1990s . The Des Plaines River bisects the village , passing from north to south ; Illinois Route 22 also divides the village into two parts , crossing the village from east to west . 
 Lincolnshire is home to the public Adlai E. Stevenson High School and to the schools that compose the elementary Lincolnshire @-@ Prairie View School District 103 . It serves as the headquarters for corporations including the global outsourcing company Aon Hewitt , and was the base of operations for the Newman / Haas Racing team . The village of Lincolnshire hosts several annual festivals ( including one mirroring the Taste of Chicago ) in either commercial establishments such as City Park or the Village Green , or in one of its nine public parks . The village maintains a police department that closely collaborates with its local school districts . Lincolnshire manages a public works system at the direct expense of the village ; it retrieves all of its water from the city of Highland Park , which derives its water from adjacent Lake Michigan . The village has a council – manager government and is a home @-@ rule municipality . The mayor of Lincolnshire is Elizabeth J. Brandt .

 = = = Prior to incorporation = = = 
 The first inhabitants of what would become the village of Lincolnshire were Native American Potawatomi migrants from Canada and Wisconsin . The tribesmen left these northern places in the 16th century in search of a warmer , more temperate climate . The first Europeans to visit the area were the French Jesuit explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet . Shortly after arriving in 1673 at the site of what later became Waukegan , they sailed down the Des Plaines River and made contact with the local Potawatomi , who would dominate the area by 1768 . One of the Potawatomi villages that they encountered stretched along the west bank of the Des Plaines River , from what later became Illinois Route 22 south to Aptakisic Road , the first real settlement in the Lincolnshire and Half Day region . 
 The Lincolnshire area was originally a part of the town of Half Day , the first region settled by non @-@ Native American peoples in Lake County . The first white settler in the Lincolnshire area was Captain Daniel Wright , who arrived in 1834 . Chief <unk> allowed Wright to build his cabin at the south end of the Potawatomi village at the site of the intersection of present @-@ day Milwaukee Avenue and Aptakisic Road . The Potawatomi tribesmen were ousted a year later in the 1833 Treaty of Chicago , which was implemented two years after its ratification , and faced relocation . 
 The Half Day area experienced an economic boom with the arrival of new settlers during the two decades after Wright 's arrival . Among these pioneers were Seth Washburn , the first postmaster of the Vernon Township , who settled at the site of what later became the Lincolnshire @-@ Prairie View School District 103 's Half Day Intermediate School , and Laura Sprague , the first teacher to reside in the area . By 1855 , 21 years after the settling of the Half Day area by Wright , the town was a thriving community with a blacksmith 's shop , sawmill , country store , and a church . At this time , the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad connected Milwaukee to the county seat of Waukegan , and it expanded throughout the Lake County area over the next few decades ; this also contributed to the town 's prosperity . Henry Ford 's invention of the automobile in the early 20th century made Half Day a more accessible destination to other communities within the Chicago metropolitan area , and the village became a popular recreation area . This prompted the opening of many businesses , including an amusement park , a race track , a bowling alley , a dance hall , and taverns , that catered to visitors .

 Vernon Township , in which the village of Half Day lay , was carved up between wealthy farmers after the end of World War I. Edward Ryerson , Adlai E. Stevenson II , Samuel Insull , and Louis Leverone bought the majority of the territory within Vernon Township 's borders . Leverone , who had purchased the Half Day area , sold a tract of land to developer Roger Ladd and his eponymous company in 1955 . The company organized a residential subdivision out of the ceded town of Half Day and christened it " Lincolnshire " , the precursor to the present @-@ day village of the same name . However , life in the village was problematic , as the new subdivision was served by dirt roads and had neither a sufficient communal sanitation system nor a gas line . Lincolnshire 's police coverage was inefficient , as officers patrolling the area had to be dispatched from Waukegan , approximately 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the north . As a result , the Cambridge Forest Association ( CFA ) was formed to lobby for improvement in the livelihoods of the people of Lincolnshire . With sponsorship from the Cambridge Forest Association , Lincolnshire was incorporated as a village on August 5 , 1957 . The CFA was later renamed the Lincolnshire Community Association ; the entity continues to play a significant role in the political life of the village . 
 Lincolnshire 's government initially adhered to a conservative and cautious approach , and refused to annex two corporate park divisions in the 1980s . Opponents to the village government 's methods , however , won out in later years ; supporting a quick growth to rival the increasing affluence of surrounding villages , they oversaw the cessions of the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort and Lincolnshire Corporate Center over a period of years following 1983 . Lincolnshire also sought to annex the old remnants of the unincorporated community of Half Day from which it was created , but lost in a court battle with the village of Vernon Hills in 1994 ; the court case set the present @-@ day border between the two villages , which lies along Route 22 up to its intersection with Milwaukee Avenue . To consolidate these new acquisitions , Lincolnshire set to work on a new village hall that was completed in 1993 , and constructed a downtown area centered on the intersection of Aptakisic Road and Milwaukee Avenue ; the village 's endeavors included commercial regions like the Lincolnshire Corporate Center , City Park , and the Lincolnshire Commons . These facilities were planned and constructed from the mid @-@ 1990s to the mid @-@ 2000s . 
 In 2005 , Buffalo Grove and Lincolnshire reached a boundary agreement with respect to the allocation of properties surrounding and concerning the unincorporated Prairie View area , which lay in between the two Lake County villages . The acreage in question was divided equally between the two villages .

 Lincolnshire is located at 42 ° 11 ′ 47 ″ North and 87 ° 55 ′ 2 ″ West , and shares a border with the villages of Vernon Hills to the northwest , Buffalo Grove to the southwest , Bannockburn to the east , and Riverwoods to the southeast . The city of Lake Forest is located to the northeast of the village , while the unincorporated community of Prairie View borders the village directly to the west . 
 According to the 2010 census , Lincolnshire has a total area of 4 @.@ 674 square miles ( 12 @.@ 11 km2 ) , of which 4 @.@ 58 square miles ( 11 @.@ 86 km2 ) ( or 97 @.@ 99 % ) is land and 0 @.@ 094 square miles ( 0 @.@ 24 km2 ) ( or 2 @.@ 01 % ) is water . 
 The village of Lincolnshire is a suburb of the city of Chicago in the southern reaches of Lake County ; like Chicago , Lincolnshire is located in the extreme northeastern region of the state of Illinois . The Des Plaines River meanders through the eastern part of the village , dividing the town in half vertically at the village hall , while Half Day Road ( Illinois Route 22 ) splits the village in half in an east – west direction . Milwaukee Avenue ( U.S. Route 45 ) runs in a north – south direction through Lincolnshire , into the village of Buffalo Grove to the south and Vernon Hills to the north . 
 Lincolnshire has been a Tree City USA every year since 1988 . It has won the Tree City Growth Award for thirteen consecutive years . To maintain Lincolnshire 's foliage , the village passed the " Tree Preservation Ordinance " , a law that places tight restrictions on tree removal . As of 2008 , the village was working towards the eradication of gypsy moths in its area . 
 Lincolnshire lies on the border of two Chicago @-@ area watersheds : one pertaining to the Des Plaines River , and the other involving the nearby north fork of the Chicago River . This situation directly relates to the presence of the Des Plaines River in the village .

The Marriott Theatre is located in Lincolnshire , on the premises of the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort ; it sells approximately 400 @,@ 000 tickets each year . 
 The Half Day Road @-@ Milwaukee Avenue area , which is located near the Lincolnshire @-@ Vernon Hills border , is a major retail corridor that experiences heavy traffic at peak hours . Along with the Village Green area , this could loosely be considered Downtown Lincolnshire . Lincolnshire and several of its neighboring villages have collaborated in attempts to ease the traffic in the area . Another potential " downtown " is loosely centered on the intersection of Milwaukee Avenue and Aptakisic Road ; City Park , the Lincolnshire Commons , and the Lincolnshire Corporate Center constitute a retail hub in the southern end of Lincolnshire . Village Green plaza , at the intersection of Illinois Route 22 and Milwaukee Avenue , is the location for many of the festivities that the village holds .

 The village of Lincolnshire holds an annual summer festival , mirroring the more publicized and much larger Taste of Chicago in both nomenclature and intention . The Taste of Lincolnshire features and advertises " taste @-@ size " samples of local restaurants and provides local entertainment , including musicians , a raffle , and a local pet show . Since 1993 , Lincolnshire has also held the Lincolnshire Art Festival a few weeks prior to the Taste of Lincolnshire ; the event encourages Lake County artists to display their work to the community . As incentives for publicity , entertainment and parking are provided free of charge . Lincolnshire hosts a Fourth of July celebration annually known as " Red , White , and BOOM ! " , a collection of activities centered on the celebration of the American Independence Day . It incorporates live music , a raffle , and a fireworks show at local Spring Lake Park into its festivities . 
 Lincolnshire was also home to two motion picture performers : Alison <unk> , an actress famous for her role as snobbish yuppie Linda Phillips on the sitcom Duet and its spinoff , Open House , is an alumnus of Stevenson High School ; and Kyle Brandt , another graduate of Stevenson , who played Philip <unk> on the soap opera Days of Our Lives and appears as himself on the reality show The Real World : Chicago .

 Lincolnshire , despite its relatively small size , is home to nine local public parks . Spring Lake Park , which is centered on an eponymous lake and sports a small beachhead , hosts Lincolnshire 's festivities during the Fourth of July . North Park , a major sporting field and nature reserve in northeastern Lincolnshire , collaborates with Lincolnshire @-@ Prairie View School District 103 to meet both the growing need for youth sports teams and extra recreational public park space ; School District 103 also collaborated with the village of Lincolnshire to create an educational nature center called <unk> Park , which is located in southeastern Lincolnshire . The nature center runs programs to educate district students and other visitors about the local ecology , alongside the natural fauna and flora of the Lake County area , and Memorial Park is a rest stop for pedestrians and cyclists traversing eastern Lincolnshire ; Florsheim Nature Preserve , which sports an unusually high Floristic Quality Index rating , is shelter to endangered and threatened species of flora rarely found elsewhere in the county . <unk> Park , an athletic complex overshadowed by nearby North Park , sports several sports courts and a fitness course , and <unk> Park is home to a short hiking trail and sports facilities . Lincolnshire 's other two parks , Bicentennial Park and Olde Mill Park , are little more than playgrounds for local children . 
 The Lincolnshire Marriott Resort takes up a large area of land to the west of the Des Plaines River , and has an eighteen @-@ hole golf course that hugs Illinois Route 22 to the south ; the golf course is not only available to guests , but also offers lessons to local residents . The resort is also home to the Marriott Theatre , which garnered a reputation through the acceptance of 370 Joseph Jefferson Award nominations presented throughout its history . 
 Four notable sportsmen have lived within the borders of the village of Lincolnshire . Andrea Jaeger , a professional tennis player known for her successful , albeit brief , career in tennis that saw progress in Wimbledon and the French Open , graduated from Adlai E. Stevenson High School ; Matt O 'Dwyer , a former NFL football player who played for numerous teams ranging from the New York Jets to the Green Bay Packers , was born in Lincolnshire . Robert Berland , an Olympian who won medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , lives in the village .

 The government of Lincolnshire is constituted as a council @-@ manager form government with elements of home rule , which it adopted via ordinance in 1976 . The village is headed by a mayor who presides over a board of six trustees at every meeting , although the daily functions of the village are carried out by a professional salaried village manager . Once elected , the mayor serves a four @-@ year term ; the elected trustees serve four @-@ year terms that are staggered . It is the responsibility of the mayor to appoint a village manager , although the manager cannot take office until the board has approved the mayor 's choice . 
 Government meetings are generally conducted on the second and fourth Mondays of the month . In the case of a tie , the mayor has the casting vote . Mayors of Lincolnshire can veto propositions set forth by the board of trustees , although this move may be overridden by a two @-@ thirds opposition vote from the board .

The Lincolnshire Police Department runs an emergency center that accepts 911 calls in the region . 
 The Lincolnshire Police Department collaborates with Lincolnshire @-@ Prairie View School District 103 's junior high school , Daniel Wright , to form a chapter of the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program . This program has graduated sixth graders from the school every year since 1991 . 
 The village is served by the Lincolnshire @-@ Riverwoods Fire Protection District , which employs 36 sworn full @-@ time firefighter / paramedics . The Fire Protection District has three fire stations : one located in central Lincolnshire , slightly to the west of the village hall , one to the south in Riverwoods , and a third located on the north end of the district in Vernon Hills . The Fire Protection District runs free services and programs , including fire safety surveys of houses in the area . 
 Lincolnshire lies in a floodplain region , a consequence of the presence of the Des Plaines River and the proximity a fork of the Chicago River on the far east border . A third factor involves small Indian Creek , which runs north of Lincolnshire . The village participates in the National Flood Insurance Program , a Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) project , to alleviate a portion of the costs of flood damage that may <unk> affected village residents . The village also implements the Community Rating System , a disaster readiness plan .

 Lincolnshire has two school districts : Lincolnshire @-@ Prairie View School District 103 and Adlai E. Stevenson High School District 125 , although a few students living in the village also attend school in Aptakisic @-@ Tripp Community Consolidated School District 102 in neighboring Buffalo Grove . District 103 , which feeds into District 125 , is home to three schools : Laura B. Sprague Elementary School ( K @-@ 2 ) , Half Day Intermediate School ( 3 – 4 ) , and Daniel Wright Junior High School ( 5 – 8 ) ; District 125 comprises only Adlai E. Stevenson High School . Both are public school districts , funded by the government . 
 The first school to be built in what is now Lincolnshire was Half Day Intermediate School , which initially served all grades for the small town ; it was originally a one @-@ room schoolhouse before a major expansion project was undertaken to accommodate the district 's increasing population . Numerous changes were made to Half Day School between 1958 and 1965 , but it remained too small to receive all prospective students ; in 1983 , Half Day School was closed , its duties given to Laura B. Sprague Elementary School and Daniel Wright Junior High School . It was , however , reopened nine years later as Daniel Wright and Laura Sprague began to fill to capacity . 
 Lincolnshire is also served by a number of non @-@ government @-@ funded educational institutions . DeVry University 's Keller School of Management operates a branch in Lincolnshire , alongside the <unk> Campus of the College of Lake County , which is located just to the north in the village of Vernon Hills . Alumni of Stevenson High School who wish to apply for the University of Illinois may do so at an extension site located in Grayslake , a village in northern Lake County . The Lincolnshire Community Nursery School , which was founded in 1973 , accepts preschoolers who live in the eastern reaches of the village of Lincolnshire . 
 The village is home to the Vernon Area Public Library , whose district serves a large region of the Vernon Township ( specifically , the villages of Lincolnshire ; Buffalo Grove ; and Long Grove , and portions of the village Vernon Hills ) . The library district also hosts a number of special events , including book talks and informational presentations .

 Lincolnshire lies on three arterial roads : Illinois Route 22 , which is known as Half Day Road in this area ; Milwaukee Avenue , which appears as Illinois Route 21 / U.S. Route 45 ; and Aptakisic Road , which meets Milwaukee in the southern region of Lincolnshire . Lincolnshire shares its eastern border with the village of Bannockburn at Interstate 94 ( where it is a portion of the Tri @-@ State Tollway ) . Route 22 crosses the Des Plaines River before bridging Bannockburn and Lincolnshire by arching over Interstate Highway 94 . 
 Lincolnshire has two primary bike paths that cover a large expanse of the village . One runs in a north @-@ south direction alongside Riverwoods Road in the eastern half of the village , while the other runs in an east @-@ west direction from the eastern half of the village , across the Des Plaines River , and to the village hall in the west side of the village . Smaller bike paths connect individual neighborhood areas within and around Lincolnshire . 
 O 'Hare International Airport is 18 miles ( 29 km ) southwest of the village of Lincolnshire . Travel between Lincolnshire and the airport is facilitated by the Tri @-@ State Tollway , although travel by railway is also possible via the Prairie View Metra station just west of Lincolnshire .

 The Village of Lincolnshire negotiated and signed an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan . The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents . Lincolnshire is served by a sanitary sewer that connects to the Lake County Sewage Treatment Plant , which lies on the Des Plaines River outside the Village limits ; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of Lake County rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself . Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the Des Plaines River ; to protect the river 's <unk> , the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains . A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982 , and continues ; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively , although on its arterial roads ( Illinois Routes 22 , 45 , and Aptakisic Road ) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris . The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders . 
 The Village of Lincolnshire is served by the Northern division of the Waste Management , Inc . Midwest Group for solid waste disposal . 
 The engineering division of Lincolnshire 's Public Works Department maintains roads and streets under the jurisdiction of Lincolnshire , inspects existing facilities , improves existing residential subdivisions , and considers the construction of new ones . The department also manages plans in case of river floods . 
 = 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team = 
 The 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team ( " Sky Soldiers " ) is an airborne infantry brigade combat team of the United States Army based in Vicenza , Italy . It is the United States European Command 's conventional airborne strategic response force for Europe . 
 Activated in 1915 , as the 173rd Infantry Brigade , the unit saw service in World War I , but is best known for its actions during the Vietnam War . The brigade was the first major United States Army ground formation deployed in Vietnam , serving there from 1965 to 1971 and losing almost 1 @,@ 800 soldiers . Noted for its roles in Operation Hump and Operation Junction City , the 173rd is best known for the Battle of Dak To , where it suffered heavy casualties in close combat with North Vietnamese forces . Brigade members received over 7 @,@ 700 decorations , including more than 6 @,@ 000 Purple Hearts . The brigade returned to the United States in 1972 , where the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 503rd Airborne Regiment were absorbed into the 3rd Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division . The remaining units of the 173rd were inactivated . 
 Since its reactivation in 2000 , the brigade served five tours in the Middle East in support of the War on Terror . The 173rd participated in the initial invasion of Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 , and had four tours in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2005 – 06 , 2007 – 08 , 2009 – 10 , and 2012 – 13 . The brigade returned recently from a deployment stretching from late 2013 to late 2014 
 The 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team has received 21 campaign streamers and several unit awards , including the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions during the Battle of Dak To during the Vietnam War .

 The 173rd Airborne Brigade serves as the conventional airborne strategic response force for Europe . It is a subordinate unit of the U.S. Army 's V Corps and after June 2013 , subordinate to US Army Europe . 
 The 173rd Airborne Brigade currently consists of 3 @,@ 300 soldiers in seven subordinate battalions . The unit 's two active paratrooper infantry battalions are the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 503rd Infantry Regiment , an association that can be traced back to the unit 's Vietnam service . It has one National Guard paratrooper infantry battalion , the 1st Battalion , 143rd Infantry Regiment of the Texas National Guard . The 1st Squadron , 91st Cavalry Regiment is the brigade 's light reconnaissance battalion , and the 4th Battalion , 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment ( <unk> ) its field artillery battalion . 
 In support of the regular combat forces are the Special Troops Battalion and the 173rd Support Battalion . All of these units including the 4 – 319th <unk> are airborne qualified , making the 173rd Airborne Brigade the only separate airborne brigade in the United States Army .

 The 173rd Infantry Brigade was constituted on 5 August 1917 as an infantry brigade and organized on 25 August at Camp Pike , Arkansas , as an element of the 87th Division along with the 174th Infantry Brigade . The brigade deployed to France along with the rest of the division in September 1918 , but it did not participate in any campaigns and never saw combat , instead being utilized as a pool of laborers and reinforcements for frontline units . Four months later , the brigade returned to the United States , and was demobilized with the rest of the division in January 1919 at Camp Dix , New Jersey . 
 On 24 June 1921 , the unit was reconstituted as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company ( HHC ) , 173rd Infantry Brigade , and was assigned to the Organized Reserve Corps and the 87th Division at Shreveport , Louisiana . It was reorganized in December 1921 at Mobile , Alabama , redesignated on 23 March 1925 as the HHC 173rd Brigade , and redesignated as HHC 173rd Infantry Brigade on 24 August 1936 . 
 During World War II , brigades were eliminated from divisions . Consequently , the HHC 173rd Infantry Brigade was designated as the 87th Reconnaissance Troop in February 1942 and activated on 15 December 1942 . Though the brigade in name did not exist during the war , the redesignation meant that it carried the lineage of the 87th Reconnaissance Troop , and when the brigade was reactivated , it would include the troop 's lineage and campaign streamers . The troop entered combat in 1944 and fought in three European campaigns ; central Europe , the Rhineland and Ardennes @-@ Alsace operations . The maneuver battalions of the Vietnam era 173rd trace their lineage to the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment , which successfully assaulted the fortress island of Corregidor in the Philippines by parachute and waterborne operations , thereby earning the nickname " The Rock " . After the war , the troop reverted to reserve status and was posted at Birmingham , Alabama from 1947 until 1951 . On 1 December 1951 , the troop was inactivated and released from its assignment to the 87th Infantry Division .

 From 1961 to 1963 , the Army began reorganizing its force so that each division would have a similar structure , which would vary depending on the type of division it was . This move was called the Reorganization Objective Army Division ( <unk> ) plan . The plan eliminated regiments but reintroduced brigades to the Army 's structure , allowing three brigades to a division . The reorganization also allowed for the use of " separate " brigades which had no division headquarters and could be used for missions that did not require an entire division . The 173rd Brigade was selected to become a separate brigade and a special airborne task force , which could deploy rapidly and act independently . It was then designed uniquely from other separate brigades . The 173rd was the only separate brigade to have support formations permanently assigned to it , though other separate brigades would receive support elements of their own a year later . The brigade was also the only separate brigade to receive its own tank company , in the form of Company D , 16th Armor . Consistent with regimental combat teams activated before them , these separate brigades were given their own shoulder sleeve insignia . The soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade created a patch with a wing on it to symbolize their status as an airborne unit , along with red , white , and blue , the national colors of the United States . The SSI would be given to them in May 1963 . 
 On 26 March 1963 , the 173rd Airborne Brigade ( Separate ) was assigned to the regular army and activated on Okinawa . Brigadier General Ellis W. Williamson took command of the unit , which was chartered to serve as the quick reaction force for the Pacific Command . Under Williamson , the unit trained extensively , making mass parachute jumps . They earned the nickname Tien Bien ( Chinese : <unk> ) , literally Sky Soldiers , from the Taiwanese paratroopers . During their time in Okinawa , they prided themselves as the " toughest fighting men in Okinawa , if not the entire U.S. Armed Forces " . They took their theme song from the television series Rawhide . As the Pacific quick @-@ reaction force , they were the first brigade to be sent to Vietnam two years later when hostilities escalated there . 
 = = = Vietnam War = = = 
 The brigade arrived in Vietnam on May 7 , 1965 , the first major ground combat unit of the United States Army to serve in the country . Brigadier General Williamson boldly predicted on arrival that his men would defeat the Viet Cong quickly and that they " would be back in Okinawa by Christmas " . The 1st Brigade , 101st Airborne Division ; the 2nd Brigade , 1st Infantry Division ; and the 1st Cavalry Division quickly followed the 173rd into Vietnam , the first of what would eventually be 25 U.S. Army brigades to serve in the country . As larger US Army commands were established in Vietnam , the brigade was assigned to the III Corps and II Corps tactical zone , which they would serve in for the next six years . The brigade was put under the command of II Field Force , Vietnam . 
 The 1st and 2nd Battalions , 503rd Infantry were the first Army combat units from the 173rd sent into South Vietnam , accompanied by the 3rd Battalion , 319th Artillery . They were supported by the 173rd Support Battalion , 173rd Engineer Company , Troop E / 17th Cavalry and Company D / 16th Armor . The 1st Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment and the 161st Battery , Royal New Zealand Artillery were attached to the brigade for one year in 1965 . Late in August 1966 , the 173rd received another infantry battalion , the 4th Battalion , 503rd Infantry from Fort Campbell , Kentucky . The 3rd Battalion , 503rd joined the brigade at Tuy Hòa Province in September 1967 following the former 's activation and training at Fort Bragg , North Carolina . The 173rd was also assigned Company N ( Ranger ) , 75th Infantry . At its peak of its deployment in Vietnam , the 173rd Airborne Brigade ( Separate ) comprised over 7 @,@ 000 soldiers . 
 The brigade was the first unit sent into War Zone D to destroy enemy base camps , introducing the use of small Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols . On 8 November 1965 , the 173rd took part in Operation Hump , just north of Biên Hòa on the outskirts of Saigon , the capital of South Vietnam . They were ambushed by approximately 1 @,@ 200 Viet Cong fighters , suffering 48 deaths . The unit fought in the Iron Triangle , a Viet Cong stronghold north of Saigon , seeing many engagements with enemy forces during that time . They participated in Operation Crimp in 1966 , a failed attempt to root out enemy forces from the Cu Chi tunnels . 
 The attached helicopter unit became the Casper Aviation platoon , befitting a separate infantry brigade as the only separate aviation platoon deployed in Vietnam . Casper platoon was part of the HHC 173rd Airborne Brigade and its members wore the brigade patch . The attached Assault Helicopter Company , the 335th AHC , the " Cowboys " , deployed with the brigade all over Vietnam into mid @-@ 1968 and comprised the Airmobile capability along with the <unk> . Soldiers of the brigade became involved in Operation Attleboro in fall of 1966 , an operation that started out as a small search and destroy mission north of Saigon but eventually involved 22 @,@ 000 troops from 21 battalions . Soldiers of the brigade also took part in smaller humanitarian missions in between major combat operations . 
 On 22 February 1967 , the 173rd conducted Operation Junction City , the only combat parachute jump of the Vietnam War . The operation saw three brigades controlling eight battalions dropped by helicopters and US Air Force aircraft into War Zone C , in Tây Ninh Province . During the battle , the brigade operated out of the northeastern part of the war zone along with the 196th Infantry Brigade ( Separate ) , as four other brigades from the 1st and 25th Infantry Divisions attempted to surround and destroy the 9th Viet Cong Division in the War Zone . The operation was a success , and the battered VC division fled . In August of that year , the brigade received its distinctive unit insignia . The soldiers chose to have it contain a parachute and dagger to symbolize their participation in Operation Junction City and the other heavy fighting they had been through . The DUI was also inscribed " Sky Soldiers " as homage to the nickname that the Taiwanese soldiers had given them .

 In the Summer of 1967 , the 4th Infantry Division 's 1st and 2nd Brigades were making heavy contact with enemy forces in the Central Highlands of Vietnam , in western Kon Tum Province . These heavy enemy contacts prompted division commander Lieutenant General William R. Peers to request reinforcement and , as a result , on 17 June , two battalions of Brigadier General John R. Deane 's 173rd Airborne Brigade were moved into the Dak To area to begin sweeping the jungle @-@ covered mountains in Operation Greeley . The 173rd had been operating near Bien Hoa Air Base outside Saigon and had been in combat only against NLF guerrillas . Prior to its deployment to the highlands , Peers ' operations officer , Colonel William J. Livsey , attempted to warn the Airborne officers of the hazards of campaigning in the highlands . He also advised them that PAVN regulars were a much better equipped and motivated force than the NLF . These warnings , however , made little impression on the paratroopers , who were about to become victims of their own overconfidence . 
 On 20 June , Company C , 2nd Battalion ( Airborne ) , 503rd Infantry ( C / 2 @-@ 503 ) discovered the bodies of a Special Forces CIDG unit that had been missing for four days on Hill 1338 , the dominant hill mass south of Dak To . Supported by A / 2 @-@ 503 , the Americans moved up the hill and set up for the night . At 06 : 58 the following morning , Alpha Company began moving alone up a ridge finger and triggered an ambush by the 6th Battalion of the 24th PAVN Regiment . Charlie Company was ordered to support , but heavy vegetation and difficult terrain made movement extremely difficult . Artillery support was rendered ineffective by the limited range of visibility . Close air support was impossible for the same reasons . Alpha Company managed to survive repeated attacks throughout the day and night , but the cost was heavy . Of the 137 men that comprised the unit , 76 had been killed and another 23 wounded . A search of the battlefield revealed only 15 dead North Vietnamese . 
 In response to the destruction of Alpha Company , MACV ordered additional forces into the area . On 23 June , the 1st Battalion , 12th Cavalry ( 1st Brigade , 1st Air Cavalry Division ) arrived to bolster the 173rd . The following day , the Army of the Republic of Vietnam 's ( ARVN ) elite 1st Airborne Task Force ( the 5th and 8th Battalions ) and the 3rd Brigade , 1st Air Cavalry Division ( 5th Battalion , 7th Cavalry ; 2nd Battalion , 12th Cavalry ; and an additional infantry battalion ) arrived to conduct search and destroy operations north and northeast of Kon Tum . General Deane sent his forces 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) west and southwest of Dak To to search for the 24th PAVN Regiment . By October , the 173rd , the 4th Infantry Division , and six ARVN battalions were moved to Dak To . The North Vietnamese Army , in turn , had moved almost 6 @,@ 000 troops in four infantry regiments and one artillery regiment . 
 The battle around Dak To became more costly as 4 @-@ 503 of the 173rd was ordered to occupy Hill 823 , south of Ben Het Camp , for the construction of Fire Support Base . Only the battalion 's Company B was available for the attack , which was borne by helicopter . The company was able to take the hill but suffered 9 dead and 28 wounded . The following morning Bravo Company was relieved by Lieutenant Colonel David J. Schumacher 's 1 @-@ 503 , which ( against the admonitions of Colonel Livsey ) was divided into two small task forces . Task Force Black consisted of Charlie Company supported by two platoons of Dog Company and Task Force Blue which was composed of Alpha Company and the remaining platoon of Dog . Task Force Black left Hill 823 to find the North Vietnamese who had attacked B / 4 @-@ 503 . At 08 : 28 on 11 November , after leaving their overnight laager and following a PAVN communications wire , the force was ambushed by the 8th and 9th Battalions of the 66th PAVN Regiment and had to fight for its life . Task Force Blue drew the job of going to the relief of the beleaguered task force ; however , Task Force Blue ran into resistance and was pinned down by enemy fire on all sides . C / 4 @-@ 503 was then assigned the mission of relieving Task Force Black and they too encountered significant enemy fire , but they made it , reaching the trapped men at 15 : 37 . U.S. losses were 20 killed , 154 wounded , and two missing . 
 Following an attack on the Đắk Tô Base , and actions on hill 882 by the 1 @-@ 503rd that saw 7 men dead and 34 wounded , 330 men of 2 @-@ 503 moved in to assault Hill 875 . At 10 : 30 , as the Americans moved to within 300 metres ( 984 ft ) of the crest , PAVN machine gunners opened fire on the advancing paratroopers . Then B @-@ 40 rockets and 57 mm recoilless rifle fire were unleashed upon them . The paratroopers attempted to continue the advance , but the North Vietnamese , well concealed in interconnected bunkers and trenches , opened fire with small arms and grenades . At 14 : 30 PAVN troops hidden at the bottom of the hill launched a massed assault from the rear . Unknown to the Americans , they had walked into a carefully prepared ambush by the 2nd Battalion of the 174th PAVN Regiment . Soon , U.S. air strikes and artillery fire were being called in , but they had little effect on the battle because of the dense foliage on the hillside . Resupply became a necessity because of high ammunition expenditures and lack of water , but it was also an impossibility . Six UH @-@ 1 helicopters were shot down or badly damaged that afternoon trying to get to 2 @-@ 503 . 
 The next morning the three companies of 4 @-@ 503 were chosen to set out and relieve the men on Hill 875 . Because of intense PAVN sniper and mortar fire ( and the terrain ) it took until nightfall for the relief force to reach the beleaguered battalion . On the afternoon of 21 November both battalions moved out to take the crest . During fierce , close @-@ quarters fighting , some of the paratroopers made it into the PAVN trench line but were ordered to pull back as darkness fell . 
 The following day was spent in launching airstrikes and a heavy artillery bombardment against the hilltop , totally denuding it of cover . On 23 November , 2 @-@ 503 and 4 @-@ 503 were ordered to renew their assault while the 1st Battalion , 12th Infantry assaulted 875 from the south . This time the Americans gained the crest , but the North Vietnamese had already abandoned their positions , leaving only a few dozen charred bodies and weapons . 
 The battle of Hill 875 had cost 2 @-@ 503 87 killed , 130 wounded , and three missing . 4 @-@ 503 suffered 28 killed 123 wounded , and four missing . Combined with noncombatant losses , this represented one @-@ fifth of the 173rd Airborne Brigade 's total strength . For its combined actions during operations around Dak To , the 173rd Airborne Brigade was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation . 340 of the 570 173rd Airborne troops who attacked the hill became casualties .

 The intense fighting during the Battle of Dak To took a heavy human toll on the 173rd . While several of its units , including the 2 @-@ 503rd and A / 3 @-@ 319th were ordered to Tuy Hòa to repair and refit , the 173rd was transferred to Camp Radcliff in An Khê and Bong Son areas during 1968 , seeing very little action while the combat ineffective elements of the brigade were rebuilt . Company D , 16th Armor was engaged in a battle that took place on 4 March 1968 at North Tuy Hòa . During the day , the company lost 8 men killed and 21 wounded . The enemy took a much greater loss . An estimated 2 enemy battalions , 85th Main Force ( VC ) and the 95th NVA Regiment , were rendered ineffective as they had 297 KIA 's , with D / 16 Armor receiving credit for killing 218 . The company commander , Captain Robert <unk> , was awarded the DSC . One of few combat operations that brigade conducted during this time was an amphibious assault against North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong forces as part of an operation to clear the rice @-@ growing lowlands along the Bong Song littoral . The unit then served in An Khê until mid @-@ 1969 , seeing little in the way of heavy fighting . From April 1969 until its withdrawal from Vietnam in 1971 , the brigade served in Bình Định Province . From April until August 1971 , the unit underwent the process of redeployment to Fort Campbell , Kentucky in the United States , the first time that the 173rd Airborne Brigade in name had returned to the country since 1942 . During more than six years of continuous combat , the brigade earned 14 campaign streamers and four unit citations , the Presidential Unit Citation , a Meritorious Unit Commendation , a Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry , and a Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Honor Medal . Sky Soldiers serving in Vietnam received 13 Medals of Honor , 32 Distinguished Service Crosses , 1 @,@ 736 Silver Stars and more than 6 @,@ 000 Purple Hearts . The 173rd incurred 1 @,@ 533 deaths and around 6 @,@ 000 wounded . 
 After Vietnam , the Army retained the 173rd Airborne Brigade as a quick deploying contingency brigade . However , with the ending of conscription following America 's disengagement from Vietnam , many of the Army 's formations had to be rebuilt for the volunteer force . One of these was the 101st Airborne Division , which had also been redeployed to Fort Campbell . It was decided that the 173rd would be used to help rebuild the division , which had been converted into an airmobile formation during the Vietnam War . The brigade was inactivated on 14 January 1972 at the fort , and its assets were used to form the 3rd Brigade , 101st Airborne Division , a parachute component within the airmobile 101st . The 3rd Brigade went off jump status on 1 April 1974 , the same date on which the Airmobile Badge ( Air Assault Badge as of 4 October 1974 ) was introduced .

 In the late 1990s , Army leaders including General Eric Shinseki began shifting the Army force toward brigade centered operations . All separate brigades had been inactivated in the 1990s as part of the U.S. Army 's drawdown following the end of the Cold War . These <unk> , along with subsequent reorganization of U.S. Army divisions , saw several divisional brigades stationed in bases that were far from the division 's headquarters and support units . These brigades had difficulty operating without support from higher headquarters . 
 It was Shinseki 's idea to reactivate a few separate brigades and assign them their own support and sustainment units , which would allow them to function independently of division @-@ level headquarters . These formations were termed " brigade combat teams " . Such units could be stationed in bases far from major commands , not requiring division @-@ level unit support , an advantage in places like Alaska and Europe , where stationing entire divisions was unnecessary or impractical . The first of the separate brigades was the 172nd Infantry Brigade , activated in 1998 . The 173rd Airborne Brigade was reactivated in 2000 at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza , Italy , using the assets of the <unk> Infantry brigade , primarily the 1st Battalion , 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment and Battery D , 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment . Not long after its reactivation , elements were deployed to Kosovo as part of Operation Rapid Guardian in support of Kosovo Force ( KFOR ) . 
 In 2002 , 2nd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment ( 2 @-@ 503rd ) activated , providing a second infantry battalion . The unit finally reached " initial operating capability " on 14 March 2003 , with all units ready for deployment . It would be in combat 12 days later . 
 In 2003 , as preparations were being made for Operation Iraqi Freedom , the 173rd Airborne Brigade was assigned to be a part of an assault from the north of Iraq . The original plan was for the 173rd to be attached to the 4th Infantry Division as a flexible force of airborne troops to complement the heavy weapons of the division 's three brigades . Supported by the 1st Infantry Division and the 10th Special Forces Group , the 4th Infantry Division was to assemble in Turkey and use its heavy mechanized brigades to attack through Tikrit and eventually assist V Corps , which would attack from the south , in surrounding Baghdad . However , this plan fell through when the government of Turkey would not allow offensive operations to be conducted from its soil , and the entire 4th Infantry Division was left stuck on ships in the Mediterranean for the opening of the operation . This meant that the entire northern front of the war would be conducted by the 173rd Airborne Brigade and Army special forces operating with aircraft from Europe as their only supply line . As the brigade had no heavy or mechanized forces and only a few Humvees and an artillery battery , heavier forces were attached to it in the form of two companies of M113 Armored Personnel Carriers , M1 Abrams tanks , and M2 Bradleys from a task force of 1st Battalion , 63rd Armor , which was attached to the brigade . Task Force 1 @-@ 63 consisted of HHC / 1 @-@ 63rd Armor , C / 1 @-@ 63rd Armor and B / 2 @-@ 2nd Infantry . The force also received force field artillery headquarters from the 2nd Battalion , 15th Field Artillery , which brought a Tactical Operations Center , a Q @-@ 36 counterfire radar and Combat Observation and <unk> Team ( <unk> ) a pair of <unk> Unmanned Aerial Vehicles from the US Marine Corps , to be operated by the Brigades Ground Surveillance Systems ( GSS ) team . 
 The 173rd Airborne Brigade was made part of Task Force Viking , a special operations task force that contained elements of the 10th Mountain Division and the 10th Special Forces Group . The use of the 173rd as a part of a special operations task force was a unique first in U.S. Army history . This force was assisted by Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq and tasked with attacking key airfield and oil production positions deep in northern Iraq . The brigade would take off from <unk> Air Base in Italy , a 4 ½ -hour flight from northern Iraq . As the preparations for the brigade were in their final stages , it moved 10 trains and 300 trucks worth of equipment to the air base , as well as 120 busloads of soldiers . Though the brigade 's movement was impeded by Italian protestors , the Italian police provided escort operations to the brigade and ensured that it reached the Air Base without incident , and was not significantly delayed . Operation Iraqi Freedom began on 20 March with V Corps , consisting of the 101st Airborne Division , 82nd Airborne Division , and 3rd Infantry Division making a forceful push from the south , beginning the Iraq War . A few days later , the 173rd and 10th Special Forces Group departed for northern Iraq . 
 = = = Operation Iraqi Freedom I = = = 
 On 26 March 2003 , 954 soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C @-@ 17 aircraft onto <unk> Airfield in Northern Iraq under the command of Colonel Mayville . The jump took a total of 58 seconds , though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would have landed too far from the rest of the force . The force had been strung out over a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ yard drop zone , and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled . In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump . The paratroopers secured the airfield , allowing the C @-@ 17s to land and bring in the heavy armor and the 1 – 63rd Armor contingents . They jumped from aircraft of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron along with the <unk> Security Forces Squadron . Over the next 96 hours , the wing landed in the remaining 1 @,@ 200 soldiers of the brigade as well as their vehicles . By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations . 
 The next day , American forces advanced to Kirkuk during Operation Option North , hoping to control oil fields and military airfields in and around the city . Controlling the oil fields had been a specific operational goal of the Task Force because they were viewed as the most valuable strategic asset in northern Iraq . Between 30 March and 2 April , the 173rd Airborne Brigade , along with the Special Forces detachment and the Kurdish forces , engaged and destroyed the 2nd , 4th , 8th and 38th Iraqi Infantry Divisions as well as a force loyal to Ansar al @-@ Islam . The brigade used field artillery assets , as well as coordinated airstrikes to attack Iraqi Republican Guard units defending the city . Within a week these units began to fall apart due to desertions . On 10 April the brigade was able to move into the city , securing it after a short urban battle . The entire battle for Kirkuk cost the brigade only nine casualties . During the operation , some of the troops discovered at least two caches of Iraqi gold , totaling more than 2 @,@ 000 bars . The unit then took part in Operation Peninsula Strike , quelling Ba 'ath party resistance and other insurgent groups . These operations , though successful , would have been more effective if the 4th Infantry Division 's four heavy brigades were able to enter Iraq through Turkey as originally planned . 4th ID had to relocate their forces from Turkey to Kuwait and were subsequently slowed down in Baghdad . V Corps was not able to surround Baghdad as quickly as it had hoped because of a lack of available forces in the north . The resulting wear and tear of 4th ID 's M1 Abrams and M2 Bradleys made them an ineffective unit in tight urban areas such as Jar Salah . Because their heavily armored tanks required so much maintenance , the 173rd incorporated much of 4th ID 's area of operation into their own . The 173rd secured these areas with company sized detachments , often patrolling the 4th ID 's sectors with two unarmored <unk> cargo <unk> at any given time . 
 After the end of major combat operations in summer of 2003 , the 173rd Airborne Brigade did not engage in any major battles , though it was regularly involved in skirmishes with Iraqi insurgents . As Task Force Bayonet , the brigade included the : 2nd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment ; 1st Battalion , 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment ; 173rd Combat Support Company ; 74th Infantry Detachment ; Battery D , 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment ; 501st Forward Support Company ; and the attached 1st Battalion , 63rd Armor Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division from Rose Barracks , Germany ; 1st Battalion , 12th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division from Fort Carson , Colorado ; and Company B , 110th Military Intelligence Battalion of the 10th Mountain Division from Fort Drum , New York . The brigade served mainly in Kirkuk for the next year . During its service , the brigade was involved in what later became known as the " Hood Event " , arresting Turkish special forces soldiers , believing them to be plotting attacks against local civilian officials in northern Iraq . The Turkish forces were eventually released . The brigade also participated in Operation Bayonet Lightning in 2003 , capturing weapons and materials that the Department of Defense claimed were possibly for use against coalition forces . On 21 February 2004 , the brigade returned to Italy for a one @-@ year rest before a new deployment . 
 = = = Afghanistan , 2005 – 06 = = = 
 The 173rd Airborne Brigade deployed to Afghanistan in March 2005 under the command of Colonel Kevin Owens , in support of Operation Enduring Freedom . The brigade , organized as Task Force Bayonet , assumed control of Regional Command @-@ South ( RC South ) . 
 The 1 @-@ 508th ( minus Company B ) conducted combat operations in eastern Afghanistan , attached to 1st Brigade , 82nd Airborne Division . The 2 @-@ 503rd conducted combat operations in Zabul Province . The 3rd Battalion , 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment ( 3 @-@ 319th ) of the 82nd Airborne Division , was attached to the brigade and organized as a maneuver task force ( Task Force Gun Devil ) . It conducted combat operations in Kandahar Province . Task Force Gun Devil included Headquarters and Service Battery , 3 @-@ 319th ( including two provisional maneuver platoons ) ; Company D , 2 – 504th ; Company B , 1 – 508th ; Company A , 1 @-@ 325th ; a military police platoon ( 4th <unk> 13th MP Co . ) ; a rotating Romanian mechanized infantry battalion ; and an Afghan National Army company advised by French special forces . The 173rd Support Battalion and the 173rd Combat Support Company provided logistical support from Kandahar , while sending individual soldiers to assist at other forward operating bases . 
 One of the most notable units to operate out of a FOB was the brigade 's 74th Long @-@ Range Surveillance ( LRS ) detachment . 74th LRS operated out of FOB Price near the town of Gereshk in the Helmand Province . LRS provided the 173rd Brigade command group with key recon and intel of the province , and held control of Helmand with a 5th Special Forces Group ODA element . Assisting the LRS and 5th Group ODA were elements of the 82nd Airborne , Iowa National Guard , and ANA . The LRS detachment and 5th Group ODA conducted many combined and individual operations to ensure the stability of the region . The LRS detachment was also tasked at times for recon and intel gathering for other brigade assets , and target acquisition and designation for U.S. Air Force , U.S. Army , and RAF aircraft . The brigade returned to Italy in March 2006 . Seventeen soldiers from the brigade died during this deployment . 
 = = = Transformation = = = 
 On 11 October 2006 , as part of the Army 's " Unit of Action " modularized unit force restructuring that General Shinseki had originally envisioned the 173rd Airborne Brigade became the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team ( ABCT ) . This was a significant change as it signified the ability for the brigade to deploy its forces and sustain itself with its newly integrated support teams . By integrating these support elements , the unit became able to maintain its fighting forces with all that is required to keep the ground soldiers supplied and moving . The infantry battalions and the brigade headquarters remained in Vicenza , Italy through the transition . Four additional battalions were activated or designated at Bamberg and Schweinfurt , Germany . These battalions were : the 4th Battalion ( Airborne ) , 319th Field Artillery Regiment , the 173rd Brigade Support Battalion ( Airborne ) , and the Special Troops Battalion stationed at Warner Barracks in Bamberg , Germany , as well as the 1st Squadron ( Airborne ) , 91st Cavalry Regiment , stationed in Schweinfurt , Germany . After the new units were integrated into the brigade , the preponderance of the forces within the brigade were stationed in Germany , apart from the brigade headquarters in Italy . This dynamic was intended to last only until additional facilities were constructed at the Dal <unk> , now Del Din , airbase near Caserma Ederle at Vicenza . The 1st Battalion ( Airborne ) , 508th Infantry was reflagged as 1st Battalion ( Airborne ) , 503rd Infantry Regiment to resume the Vietnam @-@ era lineage of the 503rd Infantry battalions under the 173rd Airborne Brigade . The 1st Battalion , 508th Infantry colors were moved to Ft . Bragg , North Carolina to serve under the 82nd Airborne Division . Immediately after its transformation , the brigade began intensive training in both Germany and Italy to prepare itself for future deployments . 
 = = = Afghanistan , 2007 – 08 = = = 
 In 2006 , the brigade was notified for a second tour of duty in Iraq from 2007 to 2008 , but its deployment plan was changed to Afghanistan in February 2007 when the Pentagon announced that it would relieve the 3rd Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division along with the 4th Brigade Combat Team , 82nd Airborne Division . In the spring of 2007 , the 173rd again deployed to Afghanistan , as Task Force Bayonet , in support of Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF 07 – 09 ) , their first deployment as a fully transformed brigade combat team . The brigade was dispersed throughout the east of the country , with units operating in Kunar , Paktika , and <unk> Provinces . The 173rd ABCT officially relieved the 3rd Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division on 6 June 2007 . 
 The 173rd participated in various operations with the objective of ensuring security and subduing Taliban insurgents in the mountainous regions along Afghanistan 's border with Pakistan , near the Hindu Kush . Throughout their 15 @-@ month deployment , the brigade participated in more than 9 @,@ 000 patrols throughout the region . Journalist Sebastian Junger and photographer Tim Hetherington were embedded with Battle Company of 2nd Battalion which saw extensive action in the Korengal Valley . Junger later wrote a highly acclaimed book , War , and , with Hetherington , produced the award @-@ winning documentary , Restrepo , about the deployment . Only two weeks before the brigade was to return to Europe , a platoon of 45 soldiers from the brigade stationed in the Dara @-@ I @-@ Pech district was attacked by a large force of insurgents during the Battle of Wanat . Though the platoon was able to drive the insurgents back with air support , the fight resulted in 9 soldiers killed and 16 wounded ; the deadliest attack on troops in the country since 2005 . The brigade repositioned the base three days later . The 173rd 's tour ended in July 2008 , and the last redeploying paratrooper from the brigade returned to Europe by the beginning of August 2008 . 42 soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment . The brigade returned to Europe and home station after once again proving itself in combat throughout the eastern mountains of Afghanistan . 
 On 14 June 2009 , the 173rd Airborne Brigade was announced as one of the brigade combat teams deploying to Afghanistan , and the unit prepared to once again return . 
 = = = Afghanistan , 2009 – 10 = = = 
 From November 2009 until November 2010 , the 173rd Airborne Brigade once again returned to Afghanistan , this time to the provinces of Logar and Wardak . With combat experience already earned in other similar mountain regions in 2007 and 2008 , the Brigade distinguished itself in combat regularly against the Taliban and fought tenaciously against them , while still promoting and attempting to legitimize the Afghan government . The 1st and 2nd Battalions saw extensive action in eastern Logar and Wardak . The 1 / 91st Cavalry was given a mission to transform western Logar province into a secure environment ; a mission that was not greeted as an easy task . Given the province and its three major districts saw a massive influx of both foreign and domestic fighters due to the relatively calm winter prior to the brigade 's arrival , its company @-@ sized and platoon @-@ sized elements found themselves in combat against anti @-@ Coalition forces almost daily from the start of March 2010 until its relief . The brigade returned to its home station in Europe in November 2010 . Seven soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment . 
 = = = Afghanistan , 2012 – 13 = = = 
 In July 2012 , the 173rd Airborne Brigade once again deployed to Afghanistan as part of Task Force Bayonet to relieve the 3rd Brigade Combat Team , 1st Armored Division , Task Force Bulldog in the Logar and Wardak Provinces . This was the brigade 's fifth deployment since 2003 , their fourth to Afghanistan as they prepare for a complete transition of the security of Afghanistan to the Afghan National Security Forces . The brigade returned in early 2013 . Nine soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment . 
 In the summer of 2013 , some of the returning forces reorganized and consolidated at a single location in Vicenza , Italy . A second base was opened in Vicenza called Del Din , and is the current headquarters of the 173rd ABCT . Del Din hosts 173rd Brigade Headquarters , 2nd Battalion , 503rd Infantry ( ABN ) , the Brigade Support Battalion ( BSB ) , and the Brigade Special Troops Battalion ( STB ) . The unit did this to cover some of the spaces in Southern Europe that have opened up with the withdraw of other American forces from the area . Also during the summer of 2013 , 1st Squadron , 91st Cavalry Regiment ( ABN ) moved from Schweinfurt , Germany to Grafenwoehr , Germany .

 Symbolism : The simulated parachute and stylized wings refer to the airborne mission of the Brigade . The unsheathed sword , point to base ( implying from sky to ground ) and the hilt against the red section of the parachute canopy , alludes to the combat assault jump made by the Brigade in February 1967 , the first such jump made by any unit in Vietnam indicated by the " V " formed by the two lightning flashes on the V @-@ shaped silver edged blue area . The single sword also alludes to other Brigade " firsts " such as first American ground unit in Vietnam , first in War Zones C and D and first in the Iron Triangle . The lightning flashes are also symbolic of the Brigade 's striking power and surprise and rapidity of movement . The numerical designation of the Brigade can be readily simulated by various combinations of the design elements , i.e. , the sword indicating one ( 1 ) , the sum of the wings , the two lightning flashes and the three sections of the parachute canopy being Seven ( 7 ) and the latter by itself also being used for three ( 3 ) .

 The 173rd 's service , particularly in Vietnam , has been featured several times in popular culture . The most prominent of these is the 2006 single released by the country music duo Big & Rich , entitled " 8th of November " . The song was based on the story of Niles Harris , a member of the 173rd , during Operation Hump . On 1 July 2006 , a documentary inspired by the song and based on the brigade 's actions during the operation premiered on the GAC Channel . 
 Illinois Route 173 , which runs for 66 miles along the Illinois / Wisconsin border was designated the " 173rd Airborne Brigade Highway " in 2008 .

Throughout the movie , he wears the Vietnam @-@ era , mustard yellow , " subdued " shoulder sleeve insignia worn by 173rd paratroopers on their jungle fatigues during the Vietnam War . In the 1987 movie Lethal Weapon , the patch worn by Danny Glover 's fictional character Roger Murtaugh during a retrospective of his time in Vietnam was that of the 173rd Airborne Brigade . In the 1998 movie The Siege , fictional Major General William Devereaux , played by Bruce Willis , states that he was in the 173rd Airborne Brigade at the same time that character Anthony Hubbard was in the 82nd Airborne Division . 
 Numerous servicemen from the 173rd , mostly from the Vietnam era , gained notability after their military careers ended . These include Congressmen Duncan Hunter and Charlie Norwood , Archbishop of Baltimore Edwin Frederick O 'Brien , Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Robert M. <unk> , business owner Barney Visser , activist Stan Goff , and Sergeant Major of the Army Gene C. McKinney . 
 Sixteen soldiers have been awarded the Medal of Honor for service with the 173rd Airborne Brigade and its subordinate units . Lloyd G. McCarter and Ray E.

 Montgomery Gentry released its debut single , " Hillbilly Shoes " , in early 1999 . It entered the Billboard country singles charts two weeks before its scheduled release date , peaking at number 13 on the country charts and 62 on the Billboard Hot 100 . High radio demand for the single led to the label advancing the release date of the duo 's debut album , Tattoos & Scars , from early May to April 6 . 
 " Lonely and Gone " was the album 's second single , peaking at number 5 on the country charts by year 's end . Following it was the top 20 " Daddy Won 't Sell the Farm " , which won its co @-@ writer , Canadian country singer Steve Fox , the 2000 Society of Composers , Authors and Music Publishers of Canada ( SOCAN ) award for Song of the Year . After it , Montgomery Gentry charted the number 31 singles " Self Made Man " and " All Night Long " . The latter , which featured guest vocals from Charlie Daniels , was previously the b @-@ side to " Hillbilly Shoes " . It was also Daniels ' first appearance in the top 40 since " Mister DJ " in 1990 . The duo won the Vocal Duo of the Year award at the Country Music Association Awards in late 2000 , the first time in eight years that Brooks & Dunn did not win this award . They also won the Top New Vocal Duo or Group award from the Academy of Country Music and the 2000 Favorite New Artist — Country award at the American Music Awards .

Period . " and Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly rated it " B " , saying that the album was " testosterone @-@ laden " . In comparison , Country Standard Time reviewer Jeffrey B.

 Montgomery Gentry 's second album , Carrying On , was released in mid @-@ 2001 .

Later in 2002 , they toured with Kenny Chesney on his No Shoes , No Shirt , No Problems tour . 
 Mike <unk> , then the senior vice president of sales and marketing at Sony Music Nashville , thought that Carrying On showed an artistic growth over Tattoos & Scars , and the duo itself thought that Carrying On was more " edgy " in comparison . It was less favorably received than its predecessor ; William Ruhlmann thought that many of the songs " sound like they 're trying to [ sic ] hard to be macho " , and Country Standard Time 's Mike Clark thought that the duo was " playing it safe " , although he described the singles favorably . The album was certified gold for shipments of 500 @,@ 000 copies .

In March 2004 , My Town became the duo 's second platinum @-@ certified album . 
 Ruhlmann gave the album a generally positive review , saying that it " rocks harder as it goes along " . On the same site , Rick <unk> praised " My Town " for " painting in words and music both the pace of living in a small town " , and " Speed " for being " slower and more deliberate than the recklessness the title suggests . " On Country Standard Time , Tom Netherland called it " their third and finest release " .

 You Do Your Thing , their fourth album , was issued in mid @-@ 2004 .

In October 2005 , You Do Your Thing became the duo 's third platinum album . Rick Bell gave the album a favorable review on Country Standard Time , saying that the duo " unleash [ Southern rock ] in a torrent of brash lyrics , wailing guitars and pounding percussion . " Jurek wrote that it " is easily the finest outing by modern country 's most relevant duo ; it rocks , it 's soulful , and it 's memorable . " Montgomery Gentry toured in late 2004 – early 2005 with Trace Adkins in support of the album . 
 " Something to Be Proud Of " also served as the title track to Montgomery Gentry 's first greatest hits album , Something to Be Proud Of : The Best of 1999 – 2005 .

Its title track , co @-@ written by Neil Thrasher , Jason Sellers and Michael Dulaney , was previously recorded by Kenny Chesney on his 2004 album When the Sun Goes Down . Gentry told the Edmonton Sun that Some People Change " is based more on family issues , the love of the family , the love of neighbors , relationships " , and said that the title track " is about being able to challenge your inner demons and the things that can bring people down , alcoholism , or hatred or racism . " Montgomery Gentry 's version of the song peaked at number 7 , followed by the two @-@ week number 1 hit " Lucky Man " and the number 3 " What Do Ya Think About That " . In 2008 , " Lucky Man " was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal , the duo 's first Grammy nomination . 
 Some People Change was Montgomery Gentry 's lowest @-@ selling album at the time . Joe Galante , then @-@ president of Sony Music Nashville , thought that the album 's poor sales were because it " strayed musically from what the base had been . They have an edge to their sound , and I think we got a little too soft . " Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review , saying that it was more " touchy @-@ feely " than You Do Your Thing , and that " no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry " . Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a " C " , criticizing the duo for the contradictory viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the " defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors " in " What Do Ya Think About That " . Jurek comparatively called it a " masterpiece " and said that it was " a new pinnacle for the duo " , calling the title track " one of those tunes that defines something that lies at the heart of what is good about Americans .

On September 17 , 2010 , a day before the extended play 's slated release , Montgomery Gentry exited the label , and Hits and More was shelved .

 = = Musical styles = = 
 Montgomery Gentry 's sound is defined by Southern rock influences . Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that the duo " evokes the sound and spirit of Southern rockers like Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band , and Charlie Daniels , painting themselves as rowdy redneck rebels who still hold small @-@ town values . " They cite Daniels , Lynyrd Skynyrd and Hank Williams , Jr. as primary musical influences . Montgomery and Gentry alternate as lead vocalists , with Gentry often accompanying on acoustic guitar . Jurek wrote that " Montgomery 's rough hewn baritone and Gentry 's almost unreal range and trademark phrasing make something highly original " . In his book Country , Richard Carlin describes Montgomery Gentry as " rock [ ing ] harder than Brooks & Dunn , although their music could be seen as an extension of that successful pair 's boot @-@ <unk> ' sound . " He also writes that Gentry sings with a " sweet , high tenor " while Montgomery " complements with an earthy , sometimes raspy , baritone " , and notes that the duo has an " energetic stage show and dress " . 
 Many of the duo 's mid @-@ tempo songs , such as " My Town " , centralize on a theme of rural life . Others , such as " You Do Your Thing " and " Some People Change " , have messages of tolerance towards others with differing opinions .

Sports Illustrated columnist Frank Burlison listed him second to Jahlil Okafor on August 16 , 2012 . On September 11 , when Okafor was named a monthly blogger for USA Today High School Sports , he noted that he and Jones wanted to attend a Michigan State Spartans football game together . Jones was one of 10 USA Today preseason All @-@ USA selections ( along with Aaron Gordon , Andrew Harrison , Aaron Harrison , Kasey Hill , Okafor , Parker , Julius Randle , Noah Vonleh , Andrew Wiggins ) . At the January 5 , 2013 , Timberwolves Shootout at the Target Center , Jones led Apple Valley on a 31 – 9 run to overcome an 11 @-@ point deficit with 9 minutes and 19 seconds remaining against Rashad Vaughn and Robbinsdale Cooper High School . The head @-@ to @-@ head matchup of class of 2014 guards Jones and Vaughn was described as " arguably the best individual @-@ to @-@ individual matchup in Minnesota high school basketball history " by the Star Tribune . Two weeks before the matchup of ESPN 100 top 10 high school players , NBA.com had anticipated the matchup with a feature story . Following his junior season , he was co @-@ winner of the Minnesota Associated Press Player of the Year award for high school boys basketball , with DeLaSalle fellow junior Reid Travis . Jones led Apple Valley to the MSHSL Class 4A championship , while Travis led DeLaSalle to the 3A championship . They were joined on the Associated Press All @-@ State team by Anders <unk> , Rashad Vaughn and Graham Woodward . Jones earned the 2013 Minnesota Boys Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year and the Pioneer Press player of the year . However , Travis was the 2013 Star Tribune Metro Player of the Year in boys ' basketball . Following the season , Jones was selected by HighSchoolHardwood.com as one of two juniors ( along with Okafor ) on its first or second five selections of its 2012 @-@ 13 High School Hardwood All @-@ American teams . Stanley Johnson was the only other junior on the 20 @-@ man All @-@ American First Team . 
 On March 9 Jones listed his final seven schools : Baylor , Duke , Kentucky , Kansas , Michigan State , Minnesota and Ohio State . Jones had unofficially visited all seven of these schools before his junior season ended . In late April 2013 , Okafor 's father believed it was very possible that Okafor and Jones would matriculate together as a package . By late April , there were rumors that Cliff Alexander and <unk> Winslow would attend whatever school Jones and Okafor attended . 
 = = = Senior season = = = 
 On May 30 , Okafor cut his list of schools to eight : Arizona , Baylor , Duke , Illinois , Kentucky , Kansas , Michigan State and Ohio State , which overlapped with Jones in six schools . Although Alexander was ranked as the fifth best player in the class of 2014 by Rivals.com and had offers from four of the six schools common to both by the beginning of June , he said the chances of him matriculating with Jones and Okafor was slim . As the summer evaluation period continued , the unique nature of the possibility of Okafor and Jones , who are not related and not teammates , going to college as a package continued to get a lot of press . Jones was co @-@ MVP for the 2013 Under Armour Elite 24 All @-@ star game 's winning team . On August 13 , Jones announced that he would take official visits to four schools Baylor August 30 @-@ September 1 ; Kentucky September 27 – 29 ; Kansas October 18 – 20 ; and Duke October 25 – 27 . Notably , Duke , which is the favorite according to Star Tribune writer Amelia <unk> , is scheduled last . On August 14 , Jones confirmed that he might make a fifth official visit ( the maximum allowed by the NCAA ) to Minnesota , although they remained an unlikely underdog . Okafor visited Baylor on August 29 with Jones as the two were ranked 1 – 2 in the Rivals.com class of 2014 rankings . One of the reasons Baylor was a serious contender is that Jared Nuness , a member of the Baylor basketball staff , is Jones ' cousin . 
 On September 4 , 2013 , Rivals.com updated their ranking with Jones slipping from 2nd to 5th ( behind Emmanuel Mudiay , Johnson and Alexander ) and the top point guard position to second ( behind Mudiay ) . Rivals clarified that Okafor and Jones , who are considered a package deal , had visited Baylor together and would visit both Kansas and Duke together , but that they would visit Kentucky separately . On September 13 , class of 2014 point guard Tyler Ulis committed to Kentucky . Subsequently , Jones canceled his September 27 – 29 visit to Kentucky . As Okafor and Jones visited Kansas and Duke together during the last two weekends of October , those two schools were considered the favorites for the services of both . At Kansas , head coach Bill Self scheduled a second open practice for the weekend of the Okafor / Jones visit . ESPN.com 's number 14 overall prospect Winslow attended Duke for an official visit the same weekend that Okafor and Jones did . At the beginning of October , rumors began that Jones and Okafor would meet in a nationally televised game on December 12 that could be the first regular season high school basketball game ever broadcast on ESPN from Minnesota . On November 15 , ESPN announced the high school basketball broadcast schedule for its family of networks and the rumors were verified . On November 2 , Jones reduced his list to Baylor , Kansas and Duke and was still committed to joint matriculation with Okafor . 
 On November 7 Jones was ranked fifth behind points leader Mudiay , Alexander , Okafor and Stanley Johnson in the Mr. Basketball USA preseason tracker . He had the most points of all players without any first place votes . The preseason points leader has gone on to win the award in four of the prior five years . On November 11 , Jones and Okafor tweeted simultaneously that they would make simultaneous verbal commitments on November 15 from their local high schools . His verbal commitment announcement was scheduled on the same date as Alexander and Stanley Johnson . According to ESPN , all four were among the top 10 in the national class ( Okafor # 1 , Alexander # 3 , Jones # 4 and Johnson # 9 ) . On the eve of their announcement , Duke was the heavy favorite to land Jones and Okafor . He made his verbal commitment on ESPNU to Duke basketball on November 15 . Prior to his senior season , USA Today named him to its 10 @-@ man preseason All @-@ USA team along with Alexander , Stanley Johnson , Trey Lyles , Mudiay , Malik Newman , Okafor , Kelly Oubre , D 'Angelo Russell , and Myles Turner . On November 21 , Winslow committed to Duke , giving them the number one recruiting class in the nation with Jones , Okafor , Winslow and Grayson Allen all committed . 
 On December 12 , Apple Valley had a 5 – 0 record ( including victories over state powerhouses DeLaSalle — with a sidelined Reid Travis — and Hopkins ) and national rankings of 41 by USA Today and 16 by MaxPreps , while Whitney Young entered the game 1 – 1 with a 34 ranking . That day , in front of Mike Krzyzewski and ESPN2 's national audience , Okafor 's Whitney Young beat Jones ' Apple Valley 80 – 70 . Okafor had 22 points and 15 rebounds , while Jones had 29 points , 5 rebounds and 6 assists .

In the April 2 , 2014 , McDonald 's All @-@ American Game Jones posted 7 points and a game @-@ high 10 assists for the losing east team . 5 of the 7 points came in the final 2 minutes as the east briefly recovered the lead from a 99 – 95 deficit before losing 105 – 102 .

 Steep is a village and civil parish in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire , England . Its nearest town is Petersfield , which lies 1 @.@ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) south of the village , just off the A3 road . The nearest railway station is Petersfield , at 1 @.@ 6 miles ( 2 @.@ 6 km ) south of the village . It has two public houses , The Harrow and the Cricketers Inn , with the former being an 18th @-@ century Grade II listed building . According to the 2011 census , it had a population of 849 . 
 Iron Age and Roman remains have been found in the area . Steep formerly included a detached parish enclave called Ambersham , which lies deeply in West Sussex . It was the only detached part of Hampshire and was returned to West Sussex when a new law came into effect in 1844 . The church of All Saints was built around 1125 . From medieval times , Steep was included in the parish of East Meon until it became an independent parish in 1867 . Since 1899 the village has been the location of Bedales School , a progressive public school .

 The village name has been spelled in various ways , including La <unk> , La <unk> , and <unk> ( 14th century ) and <unk> ( 17th century ) . There is evidence of Roman occupation in the village , with pottery , coins , baths and a Roman villa being discovered on Bell Hill , directly opposite the village centre . A Roman earthworks ridge was also found on Stoner Hill , which suggests evidence of Roman roads passing through the causeway . Iron Age remains found in the area include pottery , boilers , and a site of a " sub @-@ rectangular enclosure " found in Steep village centre . A Bronze Age barrow house was also excavated in the parish .

 The village was not mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086 , however it was likely included under the entry of ' Menes ' . Beginning at an unknown point in the medieval period , the village of Steep formerly included a detached parish enclave called Ambersham , which lies 10 @.@ 3 miles ( 16 @.@ 6 km ) east in the county of West Sussex , situated near Midhurst and Petworth . Under the Counties Act of 1844 , Ambersham was detached from Steep and became part of West Sussex . For ecclesiastical reasons , it was split into two individual settlements ; North Ambersham and South Ambersham , with the former being annexed to <unk> and the latter to Easebourne . 
 Steep was not likely settled until late in the Anglo @-@ Saxon period when it was first documented under the name of ' <unk> Place ' in the 12th century . The church of All Saints was built around 1125 , and the oldest surviving dwelling in the village dates from the late 16th century , which lies opposite the church . In the early medieval period , Steep was included as a ' sub @-@ parish ' of East Meon . 
 By 1600 , Steep had a prospering local cloth @-@ making industry and two fulling mills in operation , which were driven by the nearby Ashford Stream . The early 17th century was also described by historian William Page as a " great rebuilding " of the village , in which redevelopment of many wooden buildings were replaced by stone structures . However , a decline in the cloth @-@ making industry caused a depression in the latter half of the 17th century , which resulted in the closure of both mills . 
 = = = 19th century to Second World War = = = 
 By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had disturbed traditional society and created a class of labourers who struggled to support their families in rural areas . This led to an unrest known as the Swing riots which swept across southern England , consequently reaching Selborne and <unk> in September 1830 . The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud , which still exists today . There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880 ; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows . In Steep , hops were grown for use in local breweries , watercress produced for commercial use , and a condensed milk factory was in operation in Steep Marsh . 
 Voluntary schools were built in Steep in 1875 , and the first almshouses were constructed by William Eames in 1882 . Bedales School was constructed in 1899 at a cost of approximately £ 60 @,@ 000 , which at the time of 1912 , had an enrolment of 160 children . However , another source described the school as being constructed in 1900 , and was formerly located in Lindfield , West Sussex . The First World War poet Edward Thomas lived in the village ; his children attended Bedales School and his wife also taught there .

The village is situated at the foot of the steep forested slopes of Stoner Hill and <unk> Hill , which both lie on the western edge of the South Downs National Park . The parish has two streams ; the first stream rises from Ashford Lodge and flows east to Steep Marsh , whereas a second stream rises at the foot of <unk> Hill follows the northern boundaries of the parish , joining the first stream close to the village of Sheet . Two main roads run through the parish , from Petersfield to Farnham on the east and the Petersfield and <unk> road on the southwest , the latter winding up the steep slopes of Stoner Hill . 
 The soil is of marl , clay , and sandy loam , with the subsoil being gravel and sand . The prominent crops are wheat , barley , and oats , and a smaller number of hops . According to the 2011 census , Steep had a population of 849 people .

 The church of All Saints was first constructed in the 12th century and has some parts which still date to its original design . It has a chancel that measures 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) by 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) , a nave which measures 50 feet ( 15 m ) by 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) and north and south aisles which run from 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) to 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) wide , respectively . The eastern bays of the south arcade of the nave date from 1180 ; however , it seems probable that the oldest masonry on the site belongs to an older church from either <unk> or <unk> . Before the north aisle was constructed , there is evidence to suggest that a wooden north @-@ west tower existed . 
 In approximately 1200 a north aisle was added , with its width being determined by the projection of the north transept chapel , with the west and east walls taken down at the time . The different thickness of the walls in the present church suggests that the wall for the length of the first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century . The church underwent a restoration in 1839 , with £ 370 being spent , and in 1875 at a cost of £ 2 @,@ 377 . 
 The Harrow is a Grade II listed public house which was first built in the 18th century . It is on the Campaign for Real Ale 's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors . 
 = Great Hurricane of 1780 = 
 The Great Hurricane of 1780 , also known as <unk> San Calixto , the Great Hurricane of the Antilles , and the 1780 Disaster , is the deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record . Between 20 @,@ 000 and 22 @,@ 000 people died throughout the Lesser Antilles when the storm passed through them from October 10 – 16 . Specifics on the hurricane 's track and strength are unknown since the official Atlantic hurricane database only goes back to 1851 . 
 The hurricane struck Barbados with winds possibly exceeding 320 km / h ( 200 mph ) , before moving past Martinique , Saint Lucia , and Sint Eustatius ; thousands of deaths were reported on the islands . Coming in the midst of the American Revolution , the storm caused heavy losses to British and French fleets contesting for control of the area . The hurricane later passed near Puerto Rico and over the eastern portion of Hispaniola . There , it caused heavy damage near the coastlines . It ultimately turned to the northeast and was last observed on October 20 southeast of Atlantic Canada . 
 The death toll from the Great Hurricane alone exceeds that of many entire decades of Atlantic hurricanes . Estimates are marginally higher than for Hurricane Mitch , the second @-@ deadliest Atlantic storm , for which figures are likely more accurate . The hurricane was part of the disastrous 1780 Atlantic hurricane season , with two other deadly storms occurring in October . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The exact origin of the hurricane is unknown but it probably developed , as do many hurricanes , in the east Atlantic Ocean off the Cabo Verde Islands in early October . The system strengthened and expanded as it tracked slowly westward and first began affecting Barbados late on October 9 . Late on October 10 , the worst of the hurricane passed over the island . Early on October 11 , the hurricane turned north @-@ northwest about 90 kilometres ( 56 mi ) east of Saint Lucia , and later that night it neared the island of Martinique . The cyclone gradually weakened as it passed to the southwest of Dominica early on October 12 and subsequently struck the island of Guadeloupe . 
 After hitting Guadeloupe , the hurricane turned west @-@ northwest , passing about 145 kilometres ( 90 mi ) southwest of Saint Kitts . The hurricane steadily neared Puerto Rico as it paralleled the southern coastline , and on October 14 made its closest point of approach , to the southwest portion of the island . It subsequently turned to the northwest , hitting the island of Mona in the Mona Passage before making landfall near the present @-@ day Dominican Republic province of Samaná . Late on October 15 , it reached the Atlantic Ocean and after passing about 260 kilometres ( 160 mi ) east of Grand Turk Island , it is estimated to have recurved to the northeast . The hurricane passed 240 kilometres ( 150 mi ) southeast of Bermuda on October 18 , and was last observed two days later about 475 kilometres ( 295 mi ) southeast of Cape Race , Newfoundland , Canada . 
 On October 19 , strong winds and high tides were reported in the British province of East Florida ( the northeastern portion of present @-@ day Florida ) . One modern historian suggests the hurricane passed much closer to the province than previously thought . Another possibility considered was an extension to a hurricane in the western Caribbean Sea . Because of lack of data , the exact track of the Great Hurricane is unknown . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The Great Hurricane first began affecting Barbados with rain late on October 9 . Northwesterly winds increased through the day on October 10 . 
 " ... a dreadful hurricane which began to rage with great fury at noon and continue with great violence till four o 'clock the next morning , the 11th ; At eight o 'clock at night St. Thomas 's parsonage was demolished and the church where the Rector and his family <unk> shelter began to fall about two hours after , the Chancel fell while the family were in the church ... St. Thomas 's Chapel , St. Michael 's , St. George 's , Christ Church 's and St. Lucy 's churches were totally destroyed , the other churches were severely ‘ injured ’ ( except St. Peter 's and St. Philip 's ) . Because of the demolition of the parish church and chapel ‘ divine services ’ continued in the ‘ boiling house ’ at the ‘ Rock Hall ’ estate of Thomas Harper by Rev Wm Duke and curate Hugh Austin of St Thomas . Most other buildings and works were blown down and many lives were lost . The dead could not be brought to a church so were buried in gardens and private land . ” 
 The ships in the bay broke their moorings by 4 pm , and the " full impact " arrived by 6 pm . The wind gradually backed to westerly through the night and peaked at midnight . Wind speed returned to normal by 8 am on October 11 . These winds suggest that the eye of the storm passed north of Barbados . The hurricane produced violent winds " so deafening that people could not hear their own voices . " The hurricane stripped the bark off trees and left none standing on the island . Even the strongest hurricanes do not strip the bark off trees , and Cuban meteorologist José Carlos Millás estimated that this phenomenon would require rain and winds over 200 miles per hour ( 320 km / h ) . The winds also destroyed every house on Barbados . The hurricane also destroyed all forts on the island . According to British admiral George Brydges Rodney , 1st Baron Rodney , the winds carried their heavy cannons aloft 100 feet ( 30 m ) . About 4 @,@ 500 people died on Barbados . 
 In Saint Vincent , the hurricane destroyed 584 of the 600 houses in Kingstown . At Grenada , 19 Dutch ships were wrecked . On Saint Lucia , rough waves and a strong storm tide struck the fleet of British Admiral Rodney at Port Castries , with one ship destroying the city 's hospital by being lifted on top of it . The hurricane destroyed all but two houses at Port Castries , and throughout the island about 6 @,@ 000 perished . Among the ships lost from Rodney 's fleet were the frigates HMS Phoenix wrecked on the Cuban coast , and HMS Blanche which disappeared without a trace , the sixth rate frigates HMS Andromeda and HMS Laurel which were wrecked on Martinique with heavy loss of life and five other smaller vessels either wrecked or foundered . By far the worst losses in the British fleet however were among the squadron of Rear @-@ Admiral Joshua Rowley , which was caught at sea by the hurricane off the San Domingo coast . Ships of the line HMS Thunderer which foundered with all hands , and HMS Stirling Castle which was smashed on the coast with fewer than 50 survivors , were lost and the remaining six ships were all severely damaged .

 Olivia ( Anna Torv ) has a sleepless night owing to her recent discovery that Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) was abducted from the " Over There " universe by a grief @-@ stricken Walter ( John Noble ) . She goes to the bowling alley , managed by Sam Weiss ( Kevin Corrigan ) , where he tells her she ’ s one of the best people he ’ s known , and he ’ s sure she ’ ll do the right thing . 
 In the case , it transpires that victims of attacks similar to Miranda Green ’ s have been connected to the Cortexiphan trials in Jacksonville , Florida . Olivia visits Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ) at Massive Dynamic 's headquarters and demands a full list of the subjects , one of which she knows herself to be . Nina claims not to have any such list .

 The episode was written by production staffer Matthew Pitts , a former assistant to series co @-@ creator J.J. Abrams , while former Fringe producer Brad Anderson served as director . 
 " Olivia . In the Lab . With the Revolver . " featured the first guest appearances by actor Omar Metwally and German model / actress Diane Kruger . Kruger was in a relationship with star Joshua Jackson at the time , and requested that her part be as a " gooey monster " , where her " eyes are popped out " of her head . Kruger 's character Miranda Green became the first victim of Metwally 's character James Heath , though her character died from malignant tumors on her body rather than what she commented . Metwally later made his second appearance in the first part of the second season finale , " Over There " . 
 The episode contains a deleted scene between Broyles and Olivia discussing the James Heath case , which was available on the second season 's DVD as a special feature . As with other Fringe episodes , Fox and Science Olympiad released a lesson plan for grade school children based upon the science depicted in " Olivia . In the Lab . With the Revolver . " ; the lesson 's intention was for " students [ to ] learn about the science behind cancer , with a focus on the causes and prevention of skin cancer . "

 The episode was viewed positively by CJ Stewart at The Celebrity Cafe , who stated " Overall , this was an exciting return to the familiar story structure that Fringe started out with , and yet it also moved along this season ’ s main story arch , with the writers doing an excellent job of that with plenty of references to the series ’ mythos for fans to pick out . It ’ s always exciting when a serial drama like this throws us longtime viewers a few bones , isn ’ t it ? " The Los Angeles Times ' Andrew Hanson thought there were too many " Really " ? moments , such as Olivia recalling the height notches in Jacksonville when playing a game of Clue . Hanson also believed the episode seemed too long , especially when compared to the " best episode ever , " ( " Peter " ) , which aired the previous week . 
 Writing for The A.V. Club , Noel Murray graded the episode with a B + , explaining that after the previous week 's episode , " Olivia . In The Lab . With The Revolver . " was a " return to normalcy " . Murray appreciated the episode 's use of a secret that " eats at people when they can ’ t bring themselves to air it out " , particularly spotlighting the " look of panic " on Walter 's face when Olivia and Peter leave his lab . Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly also appreciated the balance between mythology and single @-@ episode elements . " This week ’ s episode stood up as a perfectly comprehensible hour even if you were new to the series , thanks to its medical mystery and fun side @-@ moments such as Walter making brightly colored taffy . But is [ sic ] also wove in characters and names from previous episodes — Nick Lane , Nancy Lewis — and raised the tantalizing suggestion that the illness James Heath suffered from might be a malady that ’ s also afflicting parts of the alternate universe . " 
 MTV columnist Josh Wigler positively noted " Mysteries of the week are always compelling when they have interplay with the overarching mythology of Fringe , which was exactly the case in tonight 's installment . " He also liked the " interesting dynamic " between the still @-@ clueless Peter and the Fringe team about his unknown past . Ramsey Isler from IGN rated the episode 7 @.@ 8 / 10 ; he compared it to " Peter " , believing that this week 's episode 's had " a tough act to follow ... this story definitely isn 't as good , but it did keep us going along an interesting path to more answers . " The IGN writer praised Walter going back to his old jokes while at the same time possessing " an undercurrent of fear and shame in his personality as he deals with Olivia 's knowledge of Peter 's secret " , but disliked the first half 's " slow , procedural " elements as well as the cancer make @-@ up . Despite these small critiques , Isler " liked most of this installment " , expressing delight that there were a rare two mythology episodes in a row and that there were subtle references to previous episodes such as Nick Lane in " Bad Dreams " . Some reviewers liked the episode title but were disappointed that more elements from the boardgame had not been incorporated into the episode .

 A music video for the song was directed by Cameron Duddy and Mars , and was released on October 15 , 2012 .

The video has a vintage style , like those of VHS tapes . Mars explained to MTV News , " The concept is just old @-@ fashioned fun . No story line , it 's not me singing to a girl , you get a good sense of what you 're going to get live ... It 's very VHS @-@ y . I love that man , it takes me back to my childhood , when the tracking is off and the color is off , there 's a beauty in that . You 'd have to stand by the TV with , like , aluminum foil all over you . " 
 Hugh McIntire of Billboard explained the video , writing , " Everything about " Locked Out of Heaven " – whether it be the video or the track itself – is retro . While the song references the early discography of The Police , the video takes us back a little bit further . From the style of their dress and the wonky @-@ TV effects on the video , one might guess that Bruno and his friends are partying in the ' 70s . Only the Akai MPC sampler being played by a band member reminds the viewer that this video is , in fact , modern . "

 Apple is a member of the Business Software Alliance ( BSA ) , whose principal activity is trying to stop copyright infringement of software produced by BSA members ; Apple treats all its intellectual property as a business asset , engaging in litigation as one method among many to police its assets and to respond to claims by others against it . Apple 's portfolio of intellectual property is broad enough , for trademarks alone , to encompass several pages of the company 's web site and , in April 2012 , it listed 176 general business trademarks , 79 service marks , 7 trademarks related to NeXT products and services , and 2 trademarks related to <unk> . Apple claims copyright interests in multiple products and processes and owns and licenses patents of various types as well and , while it states it generally does not license its patent portfolio , it does work with third parties having an interest in product interoperability . Steve Jobs alone was a named inventor on over 300 design and utility patents . Between January 2008 and May 2010 , Apple Inc. filed more than 350 cases with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office ( USPTO ) alone , most in opposition to or taking exception to others ' use of the terms " apple " , " pod " , and " safari " ; those cases include sellers of apples ( the fruit ) , as well as many others ' less unassuming use of the term " apple " .

 The case In re Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation was filed as a class action in 2005 claiming Apple violated the U.S. antitrust statutes in operating a music @-@ downloading monopoly that it created by changing its software design to the proprietary FairPlay encoding in 2004 , resulting in other vendors ' music files being incompatible with and thus inoperable on the iPod . The suit initially alleged that five days after RealNetworks released in 2004 its Harmony technology making its music playable on iPods , Apple changed its software such that the RealNetworks music would no longer play on iPods . The claims of Apple 's changes to its encoding and its refusal to license FairPlay technology to other companies were dismissed by the court 2009 , but the allegation of Apple 's monopoly on the iPod 's music download capabilities between 2004 and 2009 remained as of July 2012 . In March 2011 , Bloomberg reported that , after a related 3 @-@ year inquiry by the Competition Commission , Apple agreed in 2008 to lower its prices on iTunes tracks sold in the United Kingdom and that Steve Jobs had been directed by the court in March 2011 to make himself available to be deposed on Apple 's FairPlay changes as they relate to the plaintiffs ' monopolization claim . 
 = = = Apple and AT & T Mobility antitrust class action = = = 
 In October 2007 ( four months after the iPhone was introduced ) , Paul Holman and Lucy <unk> filed a class action lawsuit ( numbered <unk> @-@ <unk> ) in the Northern District of California . The lawsuit referenced Apple 's SIM lock on the iPhone and Apple 's ( at the time ) complete ban on third @-@ party apps , and alleged that the 1 @.@ 1 @.@ 1 software update was " expressly designed " to disable unapproved SIM cards and apps . The lawsuit said that this was an unfair , unlawful , and fraudulent business practice ( see False advertising ) under California 's Unfair Competition Law ; that the combination of AT & T Mobility and Apple was to reduce competition and cause a monopoly in violation of California 's antitrust law and the Sherman Antitrust Act ; and that this disabling was a violation of the Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act . 
 Shortly after this initial filing , other lawsuits were filed , and these were consolidated with the original Holman suit , bringing in additional plaintiffs and complaints : Timothy Smith , et al . , v. Apple , Inc. et al . , No . C 07 @-@ <unk> RMW , adding complaints related to ringtones , and <unk> v. Apple , Inc . , No . C 08 @-@ 948 , bringing in allegations under the federal Magnuson – Moss Warranty Act . The combined case title was changed to " In Re Apple & AT & TM Anti @-@ Trust Litigation . " The court appointed lead counsel from the various plaintiffs ' lawyers , and several versions of a combined complaint were filed . 
 In October 2008 , the court denied the defendants ' motions to dismiss the case on the federal claims and granted their motions to dismiss the state unfair trade practice claims except in California , New York , and Washington , but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend those claims . In December 2011 , the district court granted Apple and AT & T 's motions to compel arbitration , following the Supreme Court decision in AT & T Mobility v. Concepcion , and decertified the class ; in April 2012 the Ninth Circuit denied plaintiffs permission to appeal . 
 In December 2011 , immediately after class decertification of the previous case , a new group of plaintiffs led by Robert Pepper won the race to the courthouse by filing a complaint in the Northern District , which was combined with some slightly later filers and titled " In re Apple iPhone Antitrust Litigation " , case 11 @-@ cv @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> . The new case is essentially the same but is filed only against Apple , not AT & T Mobility . In late 2013 , the various parts of the case were dismissed by the district court . The parts relating to SIM locking were rejected because AT & T was not a party and the plaintiffs were not willing to add AT & T. The remaining claim , in its final version , was that Apple monopolised the market for iPhone applications and that the plaintiffs were damaged by paying Apple 's 30 % commission for paid applications in the App Store , which the court rejected saying that the commission was " a cost passed @-@ on to consumers by independent software developers " , not paid by the consumers directly , and so the plaintiffs did not have standing under the Illinois Brick doctrine . 
 = = = European antitrust investigation = = = 
 In 2008 , Apple agreed to cut the price UK consumers pay to download music for their iPods after a formal complaint to the European Commission from the UK consumer group Which ? demonstrated higher prices in UK for the same iTunes songs sold elsewhere in the European Union ( EU ) . The Commission began an antitrust investigation in 2007 of Apple 's business practices after the complaint was made , but ultimately the Commission probe found no agreements between Apple and major record labels on how iTunes is run in Europe , only that Apple had been paying higher wholesale prices to UK music labels and was passing the cost along to UK customers .

 In April 2012 , the U.S. Justice Department ( DOJ ) and 33 U.S. states brought a civil antitrust action against Apple , HarperCollins , Macmillan Publishers , Penguin Books , Simon & Schuster , and Hachette Book Group , Inc . , alleging violations of the Sherman Act . The suit was filed in the Southern District of New York and alleges the defendants conspired to restrain retail price competition in the sale of e @-@ books because they viewed Amazon 's price discounting as a substantial challenge to their traditional business model . Regarding Apple in particular , the federal complaint alleged that " Apple facilitated the Publisher Defendants ' collective effort to end retail price competition by coordinating their transition to an agency model across all retailers . Apple clearly understood that its participation in this scheme would result in higher prices to consumers . " In such an agency @-@ model , publishers set prices rather than sellers . Fifteen states and Puerto Rico also filed a companion federal case in Austin , Texas , against Apple , Penguin , Simon & Schuster and Macmillan . In the same month , HarperCollins , Hachette and Simon & Schuster settled with both the DOJ and the state attorneys general , with HarperCollins and Hachette agreeing to pay Texas and Connecticut $ 52 million in consumer restitution , leaving Apple , Penguin , and Macmillan as remaining defendants . As of July 2012 , the case was still in the discovery stage of litigation . On July 10 , 2013 , District Court Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan found Apple Inc. guilty of the violation of federal antitrust law , citing " compelling evidence " that Apple played a " central role " in a conspiracy with publishers to eliminate retail competition and the prices of e @-@ books .
