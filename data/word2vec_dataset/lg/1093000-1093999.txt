 The OF Tape Vol . 2 received mostly positive reviews from music critics . Pitchfork Media 's Jordan Sargent stated that the album was mostly a success because " every member steps up " , with Domo who had " evolved from the group 's bumbling stoner into a guy who can spit dizzying , complicated verses " . Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone stated that the album contained a " fizzy energy that elevates it above its limitations " , musing that Odd Future were a lot like " early Wu @-@ Tang , a thrilling regional act , and a bunch of whip @-@ smart black hipsters whose worldview is grounded in their corner of sun @-@ baked southern California . " PopMatters 's Jeff Dunn felt that every member improved from their past mixtapes , stating that Ocean , Tyler , and Sweatshirt were all impressive , consistently " spitting dizzying , more original lines than they ever have on mixtapes past . " Dunn wrote that " after the mixed returns of Goblin , Tyler himself now seems to realize that less is more on his part " , who " wisely tones down the shock @-@ for @-@ shock ’ s @-@ sake rhymes quite a bit , making his appearances all the more rewarding when they do occur . " Steve <unk> of Paste mused that " while Odd Future ’ s critics try hard to frame them as such , it ’ s difficult to accept Tyler and the OF crew as mere shock artists , flippantly tossing off incendiary slurs for attention — the music is too tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek clever , too brainy and self @-@ aware , too anything @-@ goes eccentric . " 
 The A.V. Club 's Chris Martins praised the album , stating that " perhaps most impressive is that Tyler , The Creator takes a noticeable step back so that his friends can enjoy the spotlight . When he does show up — standouts include the hulking G @-@ funk mutation “ <unk> ” and the grungy , bass @-@ addled “ P ” — both his beats and raps thrill : All of the twisted jokes , tough introspection , and rabble @-@ rousing that fans have come to expect , with none of the unfortunate rape references his detractors rightly called him on . " Allmusic 's David Jeffries called album closer " Oldie " epic in nature , stating that Earl Sweatshirt 's return was the highlight of the album , summarizing the album as " hype warranted . " Beats Per Minute 's Craig Jenkin compared the album extensively to prior Odd Future releases , reporting that " it ditches the expansive ooze that made stretches of Tyler ’ s Goblin a chore , the nihilistic agitprop of <unk> ’ s <unk> , and the lackadaisical <unk> of Mike G ’ s Ali and Domo ’ s Rolling Papers in favor of the kind of restless , jerky energy that skyrocketed Bastard into the dialogue months prior . " He described the album as something that " mainly sounds like a bunch of dudes in a dank basement cooking up the wildest smack talk possible , with one @-@ upping each other being the primary objective . " 
 Jeff Reiss of Spin gave the album a mixed review , commenting that " it ’ s Odd Future at their best , blending eccentricity , rebellion , and weird humor , with the fearlessness of kids convinced that there are no consequences to their actions " , though noted that " at their worst , they are guilty of every adolescent ’ s biggest fear - being boring . " Ray <unk> , writer for Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed review , reporting that " robbed of their outsider status , the boys swap horror for hormones on The OF Tape , Vol 2 . , giddily trading tall tales and witty obscenities . For better or worse , OF might actually be growing up . " musicOMH 's Andy Baber viewed the album as " an eclectic and solid - if unspectacular - return , which should see their already dedicated fanbase increase " , commenting that " Frank Ocean is criminally underused " . Mike Madden of Consequence of Sound felt that " too many things happen here , from the Brick Squad @-@ type rave @-@ ups to Ocean 's R & B laments , for it to ever sound like a truly unified , full @-@ length group project .

 Gravity Bone is a freeware first @-@ person adventure video game developed by Blendo Games , and released on August 28 , 2008 . The game employs a modified version of id Software 's id Tech 2 engine — originally used for Quake 2 — and incorporates music from films by director Wong Kar @-@ wai , which were originally performed by Xavier Cugat . Four incarnations of the game were produced during its one @-@ year development ; the first featured more common first @-@ person shooter elements than the released version . Subsequent versions shifted in a new direction , with the inclusion of more spy @-@ oriented gameplay . 
 Gravity Bone received critical acclaim from video game journalists . It was called " a pleasure to experience " by Charles Onyett from IGN , and received comparisons to games such as Team Fortress 2 and Portal . The game was praised for its cohesive story , atmosphere and its ability to catch the player 's interest over a very short time span without feeling rushed or incomplete . It received the " Best Arthouse Game " award in Game Tunnel 's Special Awards of 2008 . A sequel , Thirty Flights of Loving , was released in 2012 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Gravity Bone is a first @-@ person adventure video game that lasts around 20 minutes , and is set in the fictional city of <unk> Aires . The player controls an unnamed spy , and is tasked with accomplishing several missions across the game 's two stages . At the end of the game , the player @-@ controlled spy is killed by an unknown woman after chasing her through the last half of the second level . The game was designed to leave the player without a clear idea of how the game 's story evolves . 
 During these missions , objectives and guidance are provided through the player 's interactions with objects and environments in the game . The tutorial system used to demonstrate routine gameplay elements such as object interaction and movement is disguised as the first level of Gravity Bone . Here , the player is tasked with the delivery of a contaminated drink to an unspecified non @-@ player character . After the first level is completed , the player is sent to the second level of the game , which follows the pattern of the first ; the player is assigned a set of actions and goals involving platforming sequences . 
 = = Development = = 
 Gravity Bone was developed by Brendon Chung under his video game studio Blendo Games . Chung , who worked as a level designer for Pandemic Studios , has contributed to the development of titles such as Full Spectrum Warrior and Lord of the Rings : Conquest . Four incarnations of Gravity Bone were produced during its one @-@ year development . Chung commented during an interview with <unk> that " Gravity Bone started out very different from what it was and ended up getting scrapped ... so on and so forth until this version came out . " The first version of Gravity Bone featured more typical first @-@ person shooter elements than the released version , and was based on a series of Quake 2 maps entitled Citizen Abel . He elaborated that the first version of the game had the player running around with a gun , " shoot [ ing ] things and stuff explodes . " Development shifted in a new direction , and Gravity Bone was transformed ; the player would act as a computer hacker , " hacking stuff all the time . " 
 Most of the original first @-@ person shooter elements were removed by the third revision of the game , which incorporated a more spy @-@ oriented style of gameplay , with the player " trying to quietly take out enemies and not be seen . " Chung commented that he reworked the game several more times to fit his vision : " It kept on just changing and changing and changing until it got into a more story @-@ oriented direction . " He stated that he did not feel comfortable developing Gravity Bone as a first @-@ person shooter game , and kept adding " bits and bits of more and more unconventional " elements as a result . He explained that he " got stuck on this idea of the hero never fires a gun , but he just has a bunch of tools on his belt , like a power drill or a can of pressurized Freon , a screwdriver . I thought that was kind of funny and interesting . " 
 Gravity Bone was developed using a modified version of id Software 's id Tech 2 , the graphics engine for Quake 2 . Chung acknowledged that although he has worked with newer , " powerful and flexible " engines , he preferred the older engine because it was released as an open source platform , " so you can redistribute it for free . " The voice work featured in the briefings in Gravity Bone was produced using text @-@ to @-@ speech programs , and the game incorporates music from films by film director Wong Kar @-@ wai . Chung declared that his passion for Wong 's films were an important factor in the selection of Wong 's music : " He makes these really beautiful films and I 've always wanted to use the same music in a videogame . " He said that Wong 's films had a strong influence on the development of the game .

 Charles Onyett from IGN applauded Gravity Bone , saying that it is " a game that appears to toy with the notions of heroism and villainy , and the ways the player identifies with , and is directed toward , both roles . " He praised all aspects of the game , commenting , " the cohesiveness of its striking visual presentation , soundtrack and effects , and almost entirely incomprehensible story combine to create an atmosphere of peculiar strength . " Onyett concluded his preview of the game by stating , " it 's a pleasure to experience , and never ceases to delight and surprise over its short run . " Anthony Burch from Destructoid gave a positive review , stating that it " is so stylistically unified , so consistently cool and weird and imaginative , that it 's damn near impossible not to fall in love with — even as the game ends and you 're wondering what the hell happened , and why . " He also applauded several technical and design aspects of the game , expressing appreciation for the game 's " stylistic choices " , as well as the " nigh unbelievable " bloom effects featured in the game . Burch concluded that Gravity Bone is " a great ride " , and that the " atmosphere and style alone will barrel you through to the journey 's end , which comes all too soon . " 
 Derek Yu from The Indie Games Source compared the game with Portal and stated that Chung was able to develop " an impeccable flair for graphic design " while manufacturing Gravity Bone . He concluded that the game is " bursting with delicious color , and features blocky @-@ headed characters that are infinitely more interesting to look at and interact with than the frightening <unk> game players are often forced to contend with in modern FPS 's . " Yu elaborated that it had " enough panache in its two levels to make it somewhat of an indie sleeper hit of the end of 2008 . " An editor from The Refined Geek was pleased with Gravity Bone and its sequel , Thirty Flights of Loving , awarding them each a score of 8 out of 10 and stating , " the enjoyment from these games comes from noticing all the subtle environmental clues and then using your imagination to draw the connecting dots . " The editor commented that both games highlight story elements over graphics and technical innovations , saying each game 's " true strength comes from its ability to tell a story in the extremely short time frame . " 
 Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku praised the game , writing , " if you own a PC , you owe it to yourself to play Gravity Bone . " He said the game was " one of the coolest things I 've played on PC lately . " Kieron Gillen from Rock Paper Shotgun considered Gravity Bone to be an intellectual mix of Hitman , No @-@ one Lives Forever , and Team Fortress 2 , stating that it is the " wittiest game " he has played since World of Goo . Gillen applauded every aspect of the game , stating that Gravity Bone was an " indie art game whose main effect is to delight you at every turn . " It received the " Best Arthouse Game " award in Game Tunnel 's Special Awards of 2008 .

 A sequel to Gravity Bone , Thirty Flights of Loving , was announced as a reward for contributing to the Idle Thumbs podcast revival Kickstarter . The game was released to Kickstarter backers in July 2012 , and later offered as a purchasable title on Steam , which included Gravity Bone as an additional feature . The game , though not a direct sequel in story to Gravity Bone , follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong . The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers , who called the very short but non @-@ linear storytelling of Thirty Flights a novel use of the video game medium . 
 = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯ = 
 In mathematics , 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + · · · is the infinite series whose terms are the successive positive integers , given alternating signs . Using sigma summation notation the sum of the first m terms of the series can be expressed as 
 <formula> 
 The infinite series diverges , meaning that its sequence of partial sums , ( 1 , − 1 , 2 , − 2 , ... ) , does not tend towards any finite limit . Nonetheless , in the mid @-@ 18th century , Leonhard Euler wrote what he admitted to be a paradoxical equation : 
 <formula> 
 A rigorous explanation of this equation would not arrive until much later . Starting in 1890 , Ernesto Cesàro , Émile Borel and others investigated well @-@ defined methods to assign generalized sums to divergent series — including new interpretations of Euler 's attempts . Many of these summability methods easily assign to 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... a " sum " of 1 ⁄ 4 after all . Cesàro summation is one of the few methods that do not sum 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... , so the series is an example where a slightly stronger method , such as Abel summation , is required . 
 The series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is closely related to Grandi 's series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + .... Euler treated these two as special cases of 1 − 2n + 3n − 4n + ... for arbitrary n , a line of research extending his work on the Basel problem and leading towards the functional equations of what are now known as the Dirichlet eta function and the Riemann zeta function . 
 = = Explanation of the paradox = = 
 In mathematics , if a set of rules is consistent with itself , then one can work with those rules . According to the definitions of " sum " and " equals " that most people are used to , it makes no sense to say that 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... equals anything . However , there are other , somewhat more generous , ways of defining " sum " and " equals " that don 't contradict our ordinary , finite arithmetic , but which produce some additional surprising results with infinite sums . One way to see how that could possibly work is if the series ( 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... ) is added to itself four times in just the right way , causing all the positive terms and all the negative terms to cancel out , except for one of the initial 1 's . Thus , as four copies of the series add up to 1 , the series itself would equal 1 / 4 .

 The series ' terms ( 1 , − 2 , 3 , − 4 , ... ) do not approach 0 ; therefore 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... diverges by the term test . For later reference , it will also be useful to see the divergence on a fundamental level . By definition , the convergence or divergence of an infinite series is determined by the convergence or divergence of its sequence of partial sums , and the partial sums of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... are : 
 1 
 = 1 @,@ 
 1 − 2 =

 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 5

 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 5 − 6 = 
 − 3 @,@ 
 ... 
 This sequence is notable for including every integer exactly once — even 0 if one counts the empty partial sum — and thereby establishing the <unk> of the set <formula> of integers . The sequence of partial sums clearly shows that the series does not converge to a particular number ( for any proposed limit x , we can find a point beyond which the subsequent partial sums are all outside the interval [ x @-@ 1 , x + 1 ] ) , so 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... diverges .

 Since the terms 1 , − 2 , 3 , − 4 , 5 , − 6 , ... follow a simple pattern , the series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... can be manipulated by shifting and term @-@ by @-@ term addition to yield a numerical value . If it can make sense to write s 
 = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... for some ordinary number s , the following manipulations argue for s = 
 1 ⁄ 4 : 
 <formula> 
 So <formula> . This derivation is depicted graphically on the right . 
 Although 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... does not have a sum in the usual sense , the equation s 
 = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... = 
 1 ⁄ 4 can be supported as the most natural answer if such a sum is to be defined . A generalized definition of the " sum " of a divergent series is called a summation method or summability method , which sums some subset of all possible series . There are many different methods ( some of which are described below ) that are characterized by the properties that they share with ordinary summation . What the above manipulations actually prove is the following : Given any summability method that is linear and stable and sums the series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... , the sum it produces is 1 ⁄ 4 . Furthermore , since 
 <formula> 
 such a method must also sum Grandi 's series as 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... = 1 ⁄ 2 . 
 = = = Cauchy product = = = 
 In 1891 , Ernesto Cesàro expressed hope that divergent series would be rigorously brought into calculus , pointing out , " One already writes ( 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... ) 2 
 = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... and asserts that both the sides are equal to 1 ⁄ 4 . " For Cesàro , this equation was an application of a theorem he had published the previous year , one that may be identified as the first theorem in the history of summable divergent series . The details on his summation method are below ; the central idea is that 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is the Cauchy product of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... with 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + .... 
 The Cauchy product of two infinite series is defined even when both of them are divergent . In the case where <unk> = 
 <unk> = Σ ( − 1 ) n , the terms of the Cauchy product are given by the finite diagonal sums 
 <formula> 
 The product series is then 
 <formula> 
 Thus a summation method that respects the Cauchy product of two series — and assigns to the series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... the sum 1 / 2 — will also assign to the series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... the sum 1 / 4 . With the result of the previous section , this implies an equivalence between summability of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... and 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... with methods that are linear , stable , and respect the Cauchy product . 
 Cesàro 's theorem is a subtle example . The series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... is Cesàro @-@ summable in the weakest sense , called ( C , 1 ) -summable , while 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... requires a stronger form of Cesàro 's theorem , being ( C , 2 ) -summable . Since all forms of Cesàro 's theorem are linear and stable , the values of the sums are as we have calculated . 
 = = Specific methods = = 
 = = = Cesàro and Hölder = = = 
 To find the ( C , 1 ) Cesàro sum of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... , if it exists , one needs to compute the arithmetic means of the partial sums of the series . The partial sums are : 
 1 , − 1 , 2 , − 2 , 3 , − 3 , ... , 
 and the arithmetic means of these partial sums are : 
 1 , 0 , 2 ⁄ 3 , 0 , 3 ⁄ 5 , 0 , 4 ⁄ 7 , .... 
 This sequence of means does not converge , so 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is not Cesàro summable . 
 There are two well @-@ known generalizations of Cesàro summation : the conceptually simpler of these is the sequence of ( H , n ) methods for natural numbers n . The ( H , 1 ) sum is Cesàro summation , and higher methods repeat the computation of means . Above , the even means converge to 1 ⁄ 2 , while the odd means are all equal to 0 , so the means of the means converge to the average of 0 and 1 ⁄ 2 , namely 1 ⁄ 4 . So 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is ( H , 2 ) summable to 1 ⁄ 4 . 
 The " H " stands for Otto Hölder , who first proved in 1882 what mathematicians now think of as the connection between Abel summation and ( H , n ) summation ; 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... was his first example . The fact that 1 ⁄ 4 is the ( H , 2 ) sum of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... guarantees that it is the Abel sum as well ; this will also be proved directly below . 
 The other commonly formulated generalization of Cesàro summation is the sequence of ( C , n ) methods . It has been proven that ( C , n ) summation and ( H , n ) summation always give the same results , but they have different historical backgrounds . In 1887 , Cesàro came close to stating the definition of ( C , n ) summation , but he gave only a few examples . In particular , he summed 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... , to 1 ⁄ 4 by a method that may be rephrased as ( C , n ) but was not justified as such at the time . He formally defined the ( C , n ) methods in 1890 in order to state his theorem that the Cauchy product of a ( C , n ) -summable series and a ( C , m ) -summable series is ( C , m + n + 1 ) -summable . 
 = = = Abel summation = = = 
 In a 1749 report , Leonhard Euler admits that the series diverges but prepares to sum it anyway : 
 ... when it is said that the sum of this series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 5 − 6 etc. is 1 ⁄ 4 , that must appear paradoxical . For by adding 100 terms of this series , we get − 50 , however , the sum of 101 terms gives + 51 , which is quite different from 1 ⁄ 4 and becomes still greater when one increases the number of terms . But I have already noticed at a previous time , that it is necessary to give to the word sum a more extended meaning .... 
 Euler proposed a generalization of the word " sum " several times . In the case of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... , his ideas are similar to what is now known as Abel summation : 
 ... it is no more doubtful that the sum of this series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 5 + etc. is 1 ⁄ 4 ; since it arises from the expansion of the formula 1 ⁄ ( 1 + 1 ) 2 , whose value is incontestably 1 ⁄ 4 . The idea becomes clearer by considering the general series 1 − 2x + 3x2 − 4x3 + <unk> − <unk> + & c. that arises while expanding the expression 1 ⁄ ( 1 + x ) 2 , which this series is indeed equal to after we set x 
 = 1 . 
 There are many ways to see that , at least for absolute values | x | < 1 , Euler is right in that 
 <formula> 
 One can take the Taylor expansion of the right @-@ hand side , or apply the formal long division process for polynomials . Starting from the left @-@ hand side , one can follow the general heuristics above and try multiplying by ( 1 + x ) twice or squaring the geometric series 1 − x + x2 − .... Euler also seems to suggest differentiating the latter series term by term . 
 In the modern view , the series 1 − 2x + 3x2 − 4x3 + ... does not define a function at x = 
 1 , so that value cannot simply be substituted into the resulting expression . Since the function is defined for all | x | < 1 , one can still take the limit as x approaches 1 , and this is the definition of the Abel sum : 
 <formula> 
 = = = Euler and Borel = = = 
 Euler applied another technique to the series : the Euler transform , one of his own inventions . To compute the Euler transform , one begins with the sequence of positive terms that makes up the alternating series — in this case 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , .... The first element of this sequence is labeled a0 . 
 Next one needs the sequence of forward differences among 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ; this is just 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , .... The first element of this sequence is labeled <unk> . The Euler transform also depends on differences of differences , and higher iterations , but all the forward differences among 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , ... are 0 . The Euler transform of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is then defined as 
 <formula> 
 In modern terminology , one says that 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is Euler summable to 1 ⁄ 4 . 
 The Euler summability implies another kind of summability as well . Representing 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... as 
 <formula> 
 one has the related everywhere @-@ convergent series 
 <formula> 
 The Borel sum of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is therefore 
 <formula> 
 = = = Separation of scales = = = 
 <unk> and <unk> arrive at 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... 
 = 1 ⁄ 4 by applying only two physical principles : infinitesimal relaxation and separation of scales . To be precise , these principles lead them to define a broad family of " φ @-@ summation methods " , all of which sum the series to 1 ⁄ 4 : 
 If φ ( x ) is a function whose first and second derivatives are continuous and integrable over ( 0 , ∞ ) , such that φ ( 0 ) = 
 1 and the limits of φ ( x ) and <unk> ( x ) at + ∞ are both 0 , then 
 <formula> 
 This result generalizes Abel summation , which is recovered by letting φ ( x ) = exp ( − x ) . The general statement can be proved by pairing up the terms in the series over m and converting the expression into a Riemann integral . For the latter step , the corresponding proof for 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... applies the mean value theorem , but here one needs the stronger Lagrange form of Taylor 's theorem . 
 = = Generalization = = 
 The threefold Cauchy product of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... is 1 − 3 + 6 − 10 + ... , the alternating series of triangular numbers ; its Abel and Euler sum is 1 ⁄ 8 . The fourfold Cauchy product of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... is 1 − 4 + 10 − 20 + ... , the alternating series of tetrahedral numbers , whose Abel sum is 1 ⁄ 16 . 
 Another generalization of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... in a slightly different direction is the series 1 − 2n + 3n − 4n + ... for other values of n . For positive integers n , these series have the following Abel sums : 
 <formula> 
 where Bn are the Bernoulli numbers . For even n , this reduces to 
 <formula> 
 This last sum became an object of particular ridicule by Niels Henrik Abel in 1826 : 
 Divergent series are on the whole devil 's work , and it is a shame that one dares to found any proof on them . One can get out of them what one wants if one uses them , and it is they which have made so much unhappiness and so many paradoxes . Can one think of anything more appalling than to say that 
 0 = 1 − 2n + 3n − 4n + etc . 
 where n is a positive number . Here 's something to laugh at , friends . 
 Cesàro 's teacher , Eugène Charles Catalan , also disparaged divergent series . Under Catalan 's influence , Cesàro initially referred to the " conventional formulas " for 1 − 2n + 3n − 4n + ... as " absurd equalities " , and in 1883 Cesàro expressed a typical view of the time that the formulas were false but still somehow formally useful . Finally , in his 1890 Sur la multiplication des <unk> , Cesàro took a modern approach starting from definitions . 
 The series are also studied for non @-@ integer values of n ; these make up the Dirichlet eta function . Part of Euler 's motivation for studying series related to 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... was the functional equation of the eta function , which leads directly to the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function . Euler had already become famous for finding the values of these functions at positive even integers ( including the Basel problem ) , and he was attempting to find the values at the positive odd integers ( including <unk> 's constant ) as well , a problem that remains elusive today . The eta function in particular is easier to deal with by Euler 's methods because its Dirichlet series is Abel summable everywhere ; the zeta function 's Dirichlet series is much harder to sum where it diverges . For example , the counterpart of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... in the zeta function is the non @-@ alternating series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... , which has deep applications in modern physics but requires much stronger methods to sum .

 Slackers CDs and Games , often shortened to Slackers , is a small chain of entertainment retailers located in the Midwestern United States . The store specializes in both new and used video games and music . It was founded in 1993 in Columbia , Missouri by Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias , originally as a music store . The store is known for selling local independent music , its collection of classic games , and for giving a lot of credit for trade @-@ ins . In 2007 , the store raised some controversy for stockpiling Nintendo Wiis . As of 2009 , there are 10 locations in Missouri and Illinois . 
 Jellinek has said that the name " Slackers " comes from being a slacker in college — playing video games and listening to music during their free time . A new store would be opened every few years , in various separate locations , so as not to lose business by placing two stores close together .

 The original idea behind Slackers first occurred in 1990 . Along with some friends , Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias went to a Don Henley concert , and began thinking about owning their own music store . At the time , the two were undergraduate students , and decided to focus their studies on business management and becoming entrepreneurs . Slackers CDs and Games was officially founded in 1993 , by Jellinek and Zacharias , in Columbia , Missouri . Jellinek and Zacharias opened the store after graduating from Saint Louis University , using only their own collection of 1 @,@ 500 music CDs . The name originated from their generation being considered <unk> before being given a chance to prove otherwise . Although business was slow at first , with the store sometimes only making US $ 30 in a day , business eventually increased . After 2 years they were able to open a second location in O 'Fallon , Illinois . As of 2009 , there are 10 locations in the states of Missouri and Illinois , eight of which are in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area , and two of which are in Mid @-@ Missouri .

 Slackers CDs and Games won an award for best used CD store in 2006 from the Riverfront Times . The Times cited its collection of vinyl records and independent and rare music CDs as the basis for the award . 
 Since the store buys video games from all consoles , it is known for its collection of classic titles . However , they do not require the box or manual for cartridge based games .

 On December 20 , 2007 , the store raised some controversy when Ars Technica reported that the chain was stockpiling Nintendo Wii systems to sell at a higher profit while telling retail customers that the chain did not have any systems in stock , and were not expecting any . 
 On December 21 , 2007 , Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website by stating that the article was sensationalist and misleading . Jellinek said that , of the 44 units the chain had , five were sold on eBay for $ 399 @.@ 99 , with a couple of units still in stock , and 35 were held for specific customers and sold at the MSRP . The remainder were given away . 
 Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo 's enforcement of the Wii 's $ 249 retail price , and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo . Nintendo has refused to comment on the issue . 
 = Schwester Selma = 
 Selma Mayer , known as Schwester Selma ( German for " Sister Selma " or " Nurse Selma " ) ( February 3 , 1884 – February 5 , 1984 ) was the head nurse at the original Shaare Zedek Hospital on Jaffa Road in Jerusalem for nearly 50 years . For many years she was the right @-@ hand assistant of the hospital 's founding director , Dr. Moshe Wallach . Working long hours and with limited infrastructure , she trained and supervised all personnel at the hospital from 1916 to the 1930s , and founded the Shaare Zedek School of Nursing in 1934 . She never married , and resided in a room in the hospital until her last day . In her later years she became known as the " Jewish Florence Nightingale " for her decades of selfless devotion to patient welfare . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Selma Mayer was born on February 3 , 1884 in Hanover , Germany , to a poor Jewish family . Her mother died in childbirth when Selma was five years old , leaving five young orphans . Selma later wrote , " Because I lost my mother very early and therefore had a rather difficult youth , a strong need grew in me to give people that which I had missed so much : mother @-@ love and love of human beings . Therefore I chose the profession of nursing " . 
 In 1906 she began working as a nurse at the Salomon Heine Hospital in Hamburg . She received on @-@ the @-@ job training in the hospital 's departments of internal medicine , surgery , pediatrics , and obstetrics . In 1913 she and another nurse passed the government 's nursing licensing exams , becoming the first Jewish nurses to receive a German State Diploma . 
 = = Head nurse = = 
 In 1890 the Frankfurt @-@ based Central Committee for the Construction of a Jewish Hospital in Jerusalem sent Dr. Moshe Wallach , a German @-@ Jewish doctor , to Palestine to open a Jewish hospital . In 1902 he opened Shaare Zedek Hospital on Jaffa Road , the first Jewish hospital in the New City . Wallach began with two trained European nurses , Schwester <unk> and Schwester Van Gelder , but one quit due to the " primitive conditions " that existed at Shaare Zedek in those years and the other fled to Germany during World War I. In dire need of a head nurse , Wallach returned to Europe in 1916 , during World War I. He was impressed with the similar organizational structure of the Salomon Heine Hospital in Hamburg , and asked the head nurse there if she could spare one of her staff . The 32 @-@ year @-@ old Selma Mayer was recommended , and agreed to a three @-@ year contract to fulfill her war service in Palestine . 
 Embarking on a four @-@ week train journey through Central Europe , Turkey , and Damascus , Schwester Selma arrived at Shaare Zedek in December 1916 . Several weeks later , Jerusalem was hit by a year @-@ long typhoid epidemic , and typhus and meningitis also raged in the city . The 40 @-@ bed hospital , which added another 110 beds to accommodate patients , was inundated . The hospital recruited untrained workers , whom Schwester Selma outfitted in " overalls and hoods " to protect them from infection ; she ordered all incoming patients washed and shaved over their entire bodies . Schwester Selma also introduced German standards of nursing to the wards , including white uniforms for all hospital personnel , changing of uniforms and bed sheets daily , and daily bathing of all patients . 
 While attempting to provide a high level of patient care for Jews , Christians , and Arabs , Shaare Zedek operated without electricity , indoor plumbing , central heating , or gas cooking stoves . Kerosene heaters were used to warm bathwater , and paraffin lamps were used in the operating room . It was difficult to retain staff due to the working conditions and to the exacting , temperamental nature of Dr. Wallach . Nevertheless , Schwester Selma worked 18 @-@ hour days , and expected her nurses and aides to display the same work ethic . 
 During that era , hospital nurses and midwives were trained on the job . Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses , operating @-@ room nurses , and midwives in the hospital , teaching the former how to make a hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants . Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives , who did not live on the premises . For many years , Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach 's right @-@ hand assistant in the areas of uterine <unk> , tracheotomies , and ritual circumcisions , accompanied him on house calls , and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away . From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance , and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach 's strict standards . 
 In the wards , she cultivated a spirit of warm , personalized patient care that continues to be the modus operandi for the hospital to this day . She would constantly remind her students , " Those who come to us need help " . She wrote in her memoir , " Above all they should remember and never forget that one has to try everything when dealing with the patient to cause him as little pain as possible and to spare no effort " . 
 Schwester Selma 's contract included a three @-@ month vacation in Germany every three years , but she took advantage of that clause only twice , in 1922 and 1925 . In 1927 she was offered the position of head nurse at the <unk> Stift Institution , a Jewish hospital in Leipzig . While she seriously considered the offer , the Frankfurt @-@ based board of directors of Shaare Zedek convinced her not to leave , with a promise " to support her for the rest of her life " . 
 Schwester Selma was the only operating @-@ room nurse on duty during the 1929 Hebron massacre . A rescue team managed to evacuate the wounded from Hebron and rush them to the Shaare Zedek and Hadassah hospitals in Jerusalem . Specialists from throughout Jerusalem came to Shaare Zedek to operate on the wounded , and Schwester Selma assisted them for 23 hours without a break . 
 The November 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was announced during her annual two @-@ week holiday , which she spent with friends in <unk> . Immediately after the adoption of the resolution by the UN General Assembly , 1947 – 48 Civil War broke out , leading to an Arab siege of Jerusalem . Desiring to return to her post at the hospital , Schwester Selma spent three weeks petitioning the offices of the British Mandatory government , the incoming Israeli government , and even the underground leaders , to assist her . Finally the army agreed to put her on one of its armed convoys supplying food and medicine to the besieged city . 
 During Israel 's polio epidemic in the early 1950s , Shaare Zedek was the only hospital in Jerusalem with an isolation ward . Schwester Selma displayed unceasing devotion to the running of the iron lung machines , teaching and supervising the untrained personnel who were recruited to work in the ward . 
 = = Shaare Zedek School of Nursing = = 
 In 1934 Schwester Selma founded the Shaare Zedek Nursing School . The idea was initially opposed by Dr. Wallach , who worried that the school would emphasize theory over practical nursing , but Schwester Selma 's curriculum proved him wrong . Examinations following the three @-@ year course of study were administered by doctors from the British government hospital in Jerusalem . Schwester Selma taught all the practical nursing classes in the school 's early years . After her death , the school instituted a Schwester Selma Award , which is bestowed on each year 's outstanding graduate . 
 = = Personal = = 
 A diminutive figure who stood less than 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) tall , Schwester Selma was known for her kindness and her <unk> . She adopted as her personal motto a poem by Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore , which she kept on the wall in her room : 
 I slept and dreamt 
 that life was joy . 
 I awoke and saw 
 that life was duty . 
 I acted and behold , 
 duty was joy . 
 She never married . Both she and Dr. Wallach , who also never married , lived in separate rooms in the hospital . She often welcomed staff and patients for a chat in her sparsely @-@ furnished room , where she poured them cups of mint tea . 
 Schwester Selma and Dr. Wallach adopted three girls who had been abandoned in the hospital . One was <unk> Calderon , whose mother had died and whose father had been drafted into the Turkish army ; the infant 's grandparents asked them to keep the baby . The second adoptee , <unk> , was given to them by her father , who had carried her all the way from Syria ; her mother had died en route . <unk> was killed in the 1948 Ben Yehuda Street bombing . The third adoptee was named Sarina . The girls grew up on hospital grounds and were sent to school ; one of the girls became a nurse ; another a dental technician . 
 = = Awards and accolades = = 
 In 1974 , at the age of 90 , Schwester Selma was named a " Worthy of Jerusalem " by Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek . A December 29 , 1975 TIME cover story named her as one of the world 's " living saints " in a list that included Mother Teresa , Sister Annie , Dom Hélder Câmara , and Father Matta El <unk> . Numerous publications called her the " Jewish Florence Nightingale " for her decades of selfless devotion to patient welfare . 
 Schwester Selma once received a diamond ring from a Holocaust survivor whose sister had given her the valuable item before she was deported , saying , " If I do not return , give it to a human being who has never married and has devoted her life to helping other people " . When the survivor read about Schwester Selma in the European press , she gave the ring to her . 
 = = Final years = = 
 Schwester Selma continued to work into her eighties . Even at that age , she did not consider it beneath her dignity to pick up trash from the floors , reminding her students that " there is nothing humiliating in our work " . In 1973 , while recuperating from a cataract operation , she dictated a short memoir , " Mein Leben und <unk> im Shaare Zedek Spital " ( " My Life and Experiences at ' Shaare Zedek ' " ) . 
 When the hospital moved to new and more modern headquarters in the Bayit Vegan neighborhood in 1980 , Schwester Selma moved along with it . She died on Sunday , February 5 , 1984 , two days after her hundredth birthday – the same day a special tribute event had been planned in her honor at the hospital . 
 = Never Too Far = 
 " Never Too Far " is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey for her first soundtrack and eighth studio album , Glitter ( 2001 ) . It was written and produced by herself and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis . The song was released as the album 's second single on October 23 , 2001 , by Virgin Records America . The song is a mid @-@ tempo ballad which lyrically deals with heartbreak . " Never Too Far " was used on the charity single " Never Too Far / Hero Medley " , which combines the first verse of the song with a re @-@ recorded version of the second verse and bridge of Carey 's previous single " Hero " ( 1993 ) . 
 The single did not make much impact on the U.S. charts ; however , it did reach the top forty in the UK and Australia , as part of a double A @-@ side with " Don 't Stop ( Funkin ' 4 Jamaica ) " . A radio edit of " Never Too Far " is release and found as the opening track of the song 's release . Carey was unable to film a music video for the single as she was recovering from a breakdown . Instead , a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film Glitter , where Billie Frank ( played by Carey ) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during a concert . Carey promoted " Never Too Far / Hero " medley through live performances at the 2001 Radio Music Awards and her A Home For The Holidays With Mariah Carey TV special .

 In April 2001 , Carey signed a US $ 100 million record deal with Virgin Records ( EMI Records ) . Following commencement for Glitter — her first album under the new label — and the film of same name , Carey embarked on a short promotional campaign for the project . On July 19 , 2001 , Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live ( TRL ) . She came out onto the filming stage , pushing an ice cream cart while wearing an oversized shirt . Seemingly anxious and exhilarated , Carey began giving out individual bars of ice cream to fans and guests on the program , while waving to the crowd down below on Times Square , while diverging into a rambling monologue regarding therapy . Carey then walked to Daly 's platform and began a striptease , in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble , leading him to exclaim " Mariah Carey has lost her mind ! " . 
 Following other appearances on which her publicist Cindy Berger said the singer was " not thinking clearly " , on July 26 , she was hospitalized , citing " extreme exhaustion " and a " physical and emotional breakdown " . Following her induction at an un @-@ disclosed hospital in Connecticut , Carey remained hospitalized and under doctor 's care for two weeks , followed by an extended absence from the album 's promotion . However , her record company had begun promoting " Never Too Far " as the second single from the soundtrack , but Carey was not able to promote it due to still recovering from her breakdown . The song was then released on October 23 , 2001 .

 In the film , Carey 's character Billie Frank argues with her boyfriend and producer Dice ( Max Beesley ) and they break @-@ up . Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting . Dice also misses Billie , and also begins writing a song . Billie goes to Dice 's apartment in an attempt to reconcile . He was not home , but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song : " Never Too Far " . She kisses the sheet music , leaving a lipstick imprint , which Dice later discovers . Dice plans a reconciliation , but is killed by Billie 's former producer Timothy Walker ( Terrence Howard ) after Dice did not pay the US $ 100 @,@ 000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker 's contract . At Billie 's first show at Madison Square Garden , her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television . They wonder if Billie was with him , they see that she is there and has seen the report . Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing " Loverboy " , tells the crowd never to take someone for granted , and that if you love them , you should tell them , because you might never have the chance to tell them how you really feel . She then starts to sing " Never Too Far " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Never Too Far " is a mid @-@ tempo ballad . The song was written and produced by Carey and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis ; it was released as the second single from her first soundtrack album , Glitter ( 2001 ) . It incorporates music from several musical instruments , including the piano , guitar and organ . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing , the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 62 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of C major with Carey 's vocal range spanning from the low @-@ note of D ♯ 3 to the high @-@ note of Ab5 . The song 's chorus has a basic chord progression of Gsus2 – G – G / F ♯ – Em7 – G / D – C @-@ G / B – Am7 . Described as an " adult @-@ contemporary , slow @-@ jam love song " , the song 's lyrics read " Too painful to talk about it , so I hold it in / So my heart can mend and be brave enough to love again " , speaking of emotions felt by the protagonist in the film . " Never Too Far " features " a bed of synthesized strings , gentle drums and Spanish @-@ style guitar " as its primary instrumentation , and incorporates violin and keyboard notes prior to the first verse . According to Chuck Taylor from Billboard , Carey sings the lyrics with " appreciable subtlety , gliding effortlessly " through the song . It ends with a 15 @-@ second note that would " evoke a satisfied sigh " .

 Following the weak commercial success of Glitter , Carey 's other label , Columbia Records , planned to release a compilation album of her biggest hits , titled Greatest Hits ( 2001 ) . As they had one more album to release from Carey under her old contract , they began assembling content for its release . Though still signed to Virgin , Carey composed a charity single in which all proceeds would go towards helping rebuild America , following the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 . Consequently , she re @-@ recorded her 1993 song " Hero " , and made a medley of it with " Never Too Far " . The song features a different instrumental introduction , and begins with the first verse and chorus of " Never Too Far " , and blends into the bridge of " Hero " . Several writers for the medley are credited , with Carey having written " Never Too Far " with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , and the latter with Walter Afanasieff . Aside from Jam and Lewis , Randy Jackson assisted Carey in the song 's production . In an interview with MTV , Carey described the single and its conception : 
 I started doing different charity events where I did a combination of ' Never Too Far ' and ' Hero ' . We made it into a medley and put them in the same key and made it work . People responded really well to it . It 's been interesting for me , since the events of September 11 , the way people have been playing ' Hero ' and really even talking to me about ' Never Too Far ' , ' cause that song is also about loss . I figured that it would be a nice thing to do , to put them both out for Christmas . There 's also an unreleased track on the B @-@ side , which is called ' There for Me ' which kind of has the same sentiment . The proceeds from ' Never Too Far ' and ' Hero ' and ' There for Me ' are going to go to the Heroes Fund , and it 's going to benefit police officers ' families , relief workers ' families .

 " Never Too Far " received positive reviews from critics . Billboard 's Chuck Taylor gave a positive review for the song , calling it a " shimmering ballad " that showcases the singer excelling at what made her a famous : " singing the hell out of a straight ahead love song free of gimmicks , gymnastics and self @-@ conscious attempts at targeting any particular demographic " ; he also said that " Never Too Far " would relieve fans that think Carey had been " relying more upon samples and guest vocalists lately than melody and artful performing " . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song another " syrupy @-@ sweet " ballad on the album and that it " harbors over @-@ the @-@ top performances worthy of " Star Search " ( more than fitting considering the film 's ' 80s @-@ era rags @-@ to @-@ riches storyline ) " . Harry Guerin from Raidió Teilifís Éireann wrote that " Never Too Far " showcased " her four octave range but sound [ s ] roughly like everything else she 's committed to tape during her career " .

 " Never Too Far " was never released in the United States . Due to the horrific events surrounding the United States at the time , radio stations began playing the song before its official add date to rotation . It failed to reach Billboard Hot 100 , peaking at number five on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles . It also reached number 17 on the US Adult Contemporary component chart . Worldwide , " Never Too Far " was released as a double A @-@ side with " Don 't Stop ( Funkin ' 4 Jamaica ) " , and failed to reach the top @-@ forty in most countries . In the United Kingdom , the release however reached a position of number 35 . In contrast , " Never Too Far / Don 't Stop ( Funkin ' 4 Jamaica ) " reached numbers 67 and 65 in the Netherlands and Switzerland , respectively . It managed to reach peaks of numbers 36 and 16 , in respective countries Australia and Spain . The double A @-@ side single enjoyed moderate success in both the Flemish and Wallonian territories in Belgium , peaking at numbers 4 and 1 respectively on the equivalent of the " bubbling under " charts , registering songs just below the main charts .

 Carey was unable to film an accompanying music video for the single ; at the time of its release , she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001 , and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter . She said , " When I was asked about the video I said , ' I can 't do it today ' . And nobody could accept that answer . And that 's when I started to get mad . I was , like , look , I am too fatigued . I 'm overly @-@ tired , I can 't do it as a human being . And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being . They were used to the Mariah that always says , ' Come on , let 's fight , let 's go ' . They just weren 't used to me ever saying no . I never said no before " . Instead , a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film , where Billie Frank ( played by Carey ) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold @-@ out concert . Frank 's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse , and the song 's development runs in parallel with the film 's love story .

 Wilson died in Edmonton on December 17 , 1909 , at the age of 50 , following a stroke . He had a history of health problems , including a neurological disorder . His partner in medical practice , Herman McInnes , attended him in his final illness . Wilson 's funeral , which was held on December 19 , had a procession that " extended for half a mile [ and comprised ] nearly one @-@ hundred vehicles " . He was buried at the Edmonton Cemetery . In 1947 , following the death of his wife , Emily , she was buried next to him . 
 After his death , a newspaper stated that Wilson was " in the best sense of the phrase , a great practitioner of the old school , he was not in any sense an ' old <unk> ' of a doctor , rather , he made it a practice to visit eastern hospitals at frequent [ sic ] to keep in touch with medical progress " . He was also described as " an active , public @-@ spirited citizen " of which " kindliness and geniality were outstanding qualities in his nature " . 
 Wilson Industrial Park in Edmonton was named in his honor in 1975 . 
 = Alvin Kersh = 
 Alvin D. Kersh is a fictional character in the Fox science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . He serves as a figure of authority within the series , first introduced as an Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , and is later promoted to the post of Deputy Director . Kersh acts as an antagonist who bureaucratically prevents Special Agents Fox Mulder , Dana Scully , John Doggett and Monica Reyes from investigating cases dealing with the paranormal , dubbed X @-@ Files . Kersh is played by James Pickens , Jr .. 
 Kersh first appeared as a guest role in several episodes of the series ' sixth season , returning as a recurring character in the eighth and ninth seasons . Kersh 's creation was driven by a need to place pressure on the character of Walter Skinner . The character has been met with mixed to negative critical responses , although he was initially positively received before coming to be considered a " one @-@ note " role as the series progressed . Pickens , as part of the series ' ensemble cast , earned a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for his work . 
 = = Character arc = = 
 Kersh 's first appearance in the series was during the sixth season opening episode " The Beginning " . As an Assistant Director , he temporarily became supervisor to Agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) when they were assigned away from the X @-@ Files division . During this time The Smoking Man could be seen in his office , reminiscent of his silent presence in Walter Skinner 's office in early seasons . Kersh assigned Mulder and Scully mostly to menial tasks , such as terrorist details and Federal background checks . When they did investigate an X @-@ File behind his back , Kersh would charge them for expenses they incurred on the case , forcing them to pay out of their own pocket . He also attempted to separate Mulder and Scully , believing that Mulder threw away a promising career as a criminal profiler , but that Scully 's career could still be saved . 
 When Mulder and Scully were reassigned to the X @-@ Files office , Kersh continued to climb the ladder , culminating in an assignment as Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . It was not long after his promotion that Mulder was abducted by aliens . At the beginning of the eighth season , Kersh assigned John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) to run the manhunt for Mulder . When the manhunt failed , Doggett was assigned to the X @-@ files with Scully , until Mulder was found in " This Is Not Happening " . When Mulder returned , Kersh refused to assign him to the X @-@ Files , keeping Doggett in that position . When Mulder and Doggett pursued an unauthorized case , Kersh was prepared to fire them both , but Mulder accepted full responsibility and was dismissed from the FBI . Shortly thereafter , Mulder disappeared again . After Doggett saw Kersh in a late night meeting with two conspirators , Knowle Rohrer and Gene Crane , Doggett brought in Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) to help him investigate Kersh 's involvement in Mulder 's disappearance . The investigation turned up nothing . Although Doggett seemed convinced that Kersh was involved in the conspiracy , Kersh insisted that he was actually protecting Mulder . 
 During the ninth season , the Toothpick Man ( Alan Dale ) , a key conspirator , could be seen in the company of Kersh , much like The Smoking Man before . In the end , Kersh showed a heroic side during the series finale " The Truth " , when he helped Doggett and Skinner free Mulder from a military prison . Following this , Kersh had to permanently close the X @-@ Files to appease his irate superiors . 
 = = Conceptual history = = 
 The character was named after Dr. Kersh and Anton Kersh , characters from Vampire Circus — a favourite film of series creator Chris Carter . According to writer and producer Frank Spotnitz , the creation of the Kersh character was due to the writers desiring to create another of the several characters in the series who put pressure on Walter Skinner . 
 When reflecting on the casting of James Pickens , Jr . , Spotnitz called him " another great find " , adding that " so many times over the course of the series we just got so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back because they were so wonderful . That 's what happened with William B. Davis as the Cigarette @-@ Smoking Man and with Nick Lea as Krycek , and with Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner , and that 's what happened here with James Pickens . Just a fantastic actor , not at all like this person , really transformed himself to play this part " . Spotnitz thought that , for a viewer who had weekly been watching The X @-@ Files ' sixth season , there was a great sense of gratification when — in the final moments of " One Son " — Spender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right , all along , precisely because the last thing that Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way . 
 Pickens prepared for this role by observing several of Kersh 's real @-@ life counterparts at the FBI 's Los Angeles office , where , according to the actor , the most useful thing he learned was that most of the people at Kersh 's level had been with the Bureau for twenty or twenty @-@ five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason . Robert Patrick , who portrayed John Doggett , recognized that his own character and Kersh were " both military men – Air Force , Marines " . Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A @-@ 6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War . Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that , as Kersh , Pickens would " come in each week and just nail his stuff " regardless of what else was going on . Similarly , Frank Spotnitz thought that " Robert Patrick and James Pickens really had a chemistry , loved playing scenes together . And I think their scenes together were some of the finest ones in the last two years of the show . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 Michael Avalos , writing for the Knight Ridder Tribune , felt positively about the introduction of Kersh , saying he harbored " almost fond memories " of the former recurring character , Section Chief Scott Blevins , played by Charles Cioffi . George Avalos and Michael Liedtke from the Contra Costa Times reacted positive towards James Pickens , Jr . ' s performance in the eighth season 's " Via Negativa " , saying the story " clicked " thanks to Kersh and Walter Skinner . Salon writer Aaron Kinner when writing a review for the ninth season , noted that he was the first black character since X 's death in season four , while not positive towards the character 's development during the ninth season and the season overall . 
 Writing for Cinefantastique about the character 's introduction , Paul Vitaris called Pickens " a fine addition to the cast " of the series , describing his portrayal of Kersh as " a strong presence " . However , during a review of the eighth season two years later , Vitaris described Kersh as " one of the most one @-@ note characters yet " on the series . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , describe Kersh 's return in the eighth season as " contrived but forgivable " . Shearman and Pearson noted that the character is " an effective obstruction to any number of X @-@ Files cases , but he can hardly be considered a lead villain " . 
 In 1999 , Pickens was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series for his work as Kersh , alongside Gillian Anderson , William B. Davis , David Duchovny , Mitch Pileggi and Chris Owens . 
 = HMS Renown ( 1895 ) = 
 HMS Renown was a second @-@ class predreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the early 1890s . Intended to command cruiser squadrons operating on foreign stations , the ship served as the flagship of the North America and West Indies Station and the Mediterranean Fleet early in her career . Becoming obsolete as cruiser speeds increased , Renown became a royal yacht and had all of her secondary armament removed to make her more suitable for such duties . She became a stoker 's training ship in 1909 and was listed for disposal in 1913 . The ship was sold for scrap in early 1914 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Production of a new 12 @-@ inch gun was behind schedule and the three battleships planned for the 1892 Naval Programme that were intended to use the new gun had to be delayed . In their stead , an improved Centurion @-@ class battleship design was chosen to keep the workers at Pembroke Dockyard fully employed . No formal requirement for a second @-@ class battleship suitable for use as the flagship on foreign stations or to reinforce cruiser squadrons existed at the time , but the decision to build the ship was strongly influenced by the views of the Controller of the Navy , Rear Admiral John A. " Jacky " Fisher and the Director of Naval Intelligence , Captain Cyprian Bridge who favoured smaller ships with a smaller main armament and large secondary armament . They pressed for additional ships of this type as substitutes for the two other battleships originally programmed , but this was rejected by the Admiralty as there was no demand for additional second @-@ class battleships . 
 The Director of Naval Construction , William Henry White , submitted three designs in early April 1892 and the smallest one was chosen on 11 April . The design was quite innovative in several different ways . It was the first battleship to use Harvey armour , which allowed the secondary casemates to be armoured , the first to use a sloping armour deck and the first to provide armoured shields over the main armament . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Renown had an overall length of 412 feet 3 inches ( 125 @.@ 7 m ) , a beam of 72 feet 4 inches ( 22 @.@ 0 m ) , and a draught of 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 3 m ) at deep load . She displaced 11 @,@ 690 long tons ( 11 @,@ 880 t ) at normal load and 12 @,@ 865 long tons ( 13 @,@ 071 t ) at deep load . The ship had a metacentric height of 3 @.@ 75 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load . 
 In 1903 , the crew numbered between 651 and 674 officers and enlisted men . She was considered to handle well by her captains and was a good sea @-@ boat . In view of her intended duties abroad , her bottom was coppered to reduce biofouling . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Renown was powered by two three @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller . Steam for the engines was provided by eight cylindrical boilers at a working pressure of 155 psi ( 1 @,@ 069 kPa ; 11 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines were designed to produce a total of 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) which was intended to allow her to reach a speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . The engines proved to be more powerful than anticipated and Renown reached 18 @.@ 75 knots ( 34 @.@ 73 km / h ; 21 @.@ 58 mph ) during sea trials under forced draught . The ship carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 890 long tons ( 1 @,@ 920 t ) of coal , enough to steam 6 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 900 km ; 7 @,@ 400 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 She was armed with four 40 @-@ calibre , breech @-@ loading 10 @-@ inch Mk III guns in two twin @-@ gun barbettes , one forward and one aft . Each gun was provided with 105 shells per gun . Her secondary armament consisted of ten QF ( quick @-@ firing ) 6 @-@ inch Mk II guns . Half a dozen of these guns were mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and the remaining guns were mounted on the upper deck in casemates in the superstructure . Defence against torpedo boats was provided by a dozen QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 @-@ cwt guns . Eight of these were mounted on the upper deck amidships . They fired 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) , 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 548 ft / s ( 777 m / s ) . 200 rounds per gun were carried by each ship . Renown also carried eight QF 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns . Each gun was provided with 500 rounds of ammunition . She had five 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes , one in the stern above water and two on each broadside underwater . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The ship 's armour was generally composed of Harvey steel and her waterline main belt was 6 – 8 inches ( 152 – 203 mm ) thick . It was 210 feet ( 64 @.@ 0 m ) long amidships and 7 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) high of which 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) was below the waterline at normal load . Fore and aft oblique bulkheads , 10 inches ( 254 @.@ 0 mm ) and 6 inches ( 152 mm ) ] thick , connected the belt armour to the barbettes . The upper strake of six @-@ inch armour was 180 feet ( 54 @.@ 9 m ) long and 6 @.@ 75 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) high . It covered the ship 's side between the rear of the barbettes up to the level of the main deck . Oblique bulkheads six inches thick connected the upper armour to the barbettes . 
 Renown was the first British battleship to be built with a sloped armoured deck behind the main belt as was commonly used on British protected cruisers . The top of the protective deck was even with the top of the main armoured belt and sloped down at 45 ° angle to meet the bottom of the belt . It was 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick on the flat and 3 inches ( 76 mm ) on the slope and ran between the barbettes . Outside the barbettes , the lower deck was three inches thick and ran towards the ends of the ship . 
 The barbettes were protected by 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) armour plates . The gun turrets that protected the main armament were six inches thick on their face , with three @-@ inch sides and a 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) roof . They were initially built without a rear plate because of weight distribution problems with the turrets . The upper deck casemates were protected by 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) plates on the front and sides , but the main deck casemates had six @-@ inch faces and sides . The stern torpedo tube was protected by a mantlet three to six inches thick . The sides of the forward conning tower were 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick while those of the rear conning tower were only three inches in thickness . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Renown was laid down at Pembroke Dockyard on 1 February 1893 and launched on 8 May 1895 . She was completed in January 1897 at a cost of £ 751 @,@ 206 , but then underwent lengthy sea trials that included the changing of her propeller blades that lasted until June . The ship commissioned on 8 June 1897 and served as flagship for the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Vice Admiral Sir Nowell Salmon , VC , on 26 June , at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria , with the Prince of Wales aboard . She was briefly attached to the 1st Division , of the Channel Squadron , from 7 to 12 July for manoeuvres off the south coast of Ireland . On 24 August , Renown became Fisher 's flagship , relieving the protected cruiser Crescent as flagship of the North America and West Indies Station . The ship continued as such until beginning a refit in May 1899 . 
 Upon completion of her refit in July , she transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet , once again becoming Fisher 's flagship . A strong proponent of the design of Renown , Fisher also found her highly desirable for the hosting of the social events required of a flagship in peacetime . Captain Hugh Tyrwhitt was appointed in command on 19 March 1900 . Renown also underwent a special refit at Malta from February to May 1900 to meet Fisher 's requirements for her . This included the transfer of the main deck 12 @-@ pounders to the superstructure . The ship recommissioned on 19 November 1900 , and served as flagship until Fisher ended his tour as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief on 4 June 1902 , after which she continued to serve in the Mediterranean Fleet as a private ship under a new captain , Arthur Murray Farquhar . Renown participated in combined manoeuvres off Cephalonia and Morea between 29 September and 6 October 1902 . 
 After the manoeuvres ended , she was detached from the Mediterranean Fleet and returned to the United Kingdom to be specially fitted out at Portsmouth to carry the Duke and Duchess of Connaught on a royal tour of India . These modifications included removal of the main deck six @-@ inch guns . After the modifications , she was nicknamed the " Battleship Yacht . " Renown carried the Duke and Duchess on their royal tour of India from November 1902 to March 1903 . The ship rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet in April . In August , she relieved Venerable as flagship of the fleet so that the latter ship could undergo a refit . From 5 to 9 August 1903 , Renown participated in manoeuvres off the coast of Portugal . 
 Renown was placed into reserve at Devon on 15 May 1904 , although she participated in manoeuvers the following month . On 21 February 1905 , the ship began a special refit at Portsmouth to configure her as a royal yacht . During the refit , the remainder of her secondary armament was removed to increase her accommodations . On 8 October , Renown left Portsmouth bound for Genoa , Italy . At Genoa , the Prince and Princess of Wales — the future King George V and Queen Mary — embarked for a royal tour of India . The first @-@ class protected cruiser Terrible escorted the ship during the tour . At the conclusion of the tour , Renown departed Karachi on 23 March 1906 and arrived at Portsmouth on 7 May . She was placed into reserve on 31 May . 
 In May 1907 , Renown was attached to the Home Fleet as a " subsidiary yacht " . Between October and December 1907 , Renown carried King Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain on an official trip to and from the United Kingdom . The ship was transferred to the 4th Division , Home Fleet , at Portsmouth on 1 April 1909 . Five months later , 25 September , she began a refit in Portsmouth Dockyard to convert her for use as a stoker 's training ship . 
 Renown briefly served as a tender to HMS Victory in October before her refit was completed in November . During the Coronation Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911 for King George V , the ship was used as an accommodation ship . She was slightly damaged when water tanker Aid rammed her on 26 November 1911 . Renown was offered for sale on 31 January 1913 and partially dismantled . In December 1913 , she was moored at the Motherbank , awaiting disposal , and on 2 April 1914 she was sold for scrap at a price of £ 39 @,@ 000 . She was broken up at Blyth . 
 = Provisional Government of Oregon = 
 The Provisional Government of Oregon was a popularly elected settler government created in the Oregon Country , in the Pacific Northwest region of North America . It existed from May 2 , 1843 until March 3 , 1849 , and provided a legal system and a common defense amongst the mostly American pioneers settling an area then inhabited only by the many Indigenous Nations . Much of the region 's geography and many of the Natives were not known by people of European descent until several exploratory tours were authorized at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries . The Organic Laws of Oregon were adopted in 1843 with its preamble stating that settlers only agreed to the laws " until such time as the United States of America extend their jurisdiction over us . " According to a message from the government in 1844 , the rising settler population was beginning to flourish among the " savages " , who were " the chief obstruction to the entrance of civilization " in a land of " ignorance and idolatry . " 
 The government had three branches that included a legislature , judiciary , and executive branch . The executive branch was first the Executive Committee , consisting of three members , in effect from 1843 to 1845 ; in 1845 , a single governor position was created . The judicial branch had a single supreme judge along with several lower courts , and a legislative committee of nine served as a legislature until 1845 when the Oregon House of Representatives was established . 
 = = Background = = 
 A series frontiersmen assemblies were held over several years across the Willamette Valley , with many on the French Prairie at Champoeg . The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841 , who left neither a will or had an heir in Oregon Country , left the future of his property uncertain . Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised to discuss the matter on the 17th . He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers centered on a governor . French @-@ Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed . 
 Further attempts of a pioneer government floundered until the numbers of American increased from travel over the Oregon Trail . Initiated by William Gray , the " Wolf Meetings " of early 1843 created a bounty system on predators of settler livestock . Further discussions began among the settlers until A gathering was held at Champoeg on 2 May , with under 150 Americans and French @-@ Canadians participating . The proposal for forming a provisional government was tabled and voted on twice . The first vote rejected the presented report due to the inclusion of a governor , with a second vote on each individual item proposed . On 5 July 1843 the Organic Laws of Oregon , modeled after Iowa ’ s Organic Law and the Ordinance of 1787 , were adopted by white colonists of the Willamette Valley , establishing the Provisional Government of Oregon . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The Organic Laws were drafted by a legislative committee on May 16 , 1843 and June 28 , 1843 , before being adopted on July 5 . Although not a formal constitution , the document outlined the laws of the government . Two years later , on July 2 , 1845 , a new set of Organic Laws was drafted to revise and clarify the previous version ; this newer version was adopted by a majority vote of the people on July 26 , 1845 . This constitution @-@ like document divided the government into three departments : a judiciary branch , an executive branch , and a legislature . The definition of the executive branch had previously been modified , in late 1844 , from a three @-@ person committee to a single governor ; this change took effect in 1845 . 
 When appealing for military aid from the American Government in the aftermath of the Whitman massacre , the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government : 
 The very nature of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy , is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government . This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments . Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government , from its very nature weak and insufficient . 
 = = = Executive branch = = = 
 With the first set of laws , the people created a three @-@ person Executive Committee to act as an executive . The Second Executive Committee was elected on May 14 , 1844 , and served until June 12 , 1845 . A December 1844 amendment of the Organic Laws eliminated the Executive Committee in favor of a single governor , taking effect in June 1845 . At that time George Abernethy was elected as the first governor . Abernethy would be the only governor under the Provisional Government . He was reelected in 1847 , and served until 1849 . 
 = = = Legislative branch = = = 
 The Provisional Legislature held session mainly in Oregon City . They met at different times each year , and in 1848 they did not meet ; too many members had left for the California gold fields . The legislature enacted various laws , sent memorials to Congress , incorporated towns and organizations , and granted divorces and licenses to run ferries . After the establishment of the Oregon Territory , the legislature was replaced with the two house Oregon Territorial Legislature . 
 = = = Judicial branch = = = 
 The Provisional Government also included a judiciary . The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single supreme judge and two justices of the peace . The supreme judge was elected by the people , but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed . This supreme court had original and appellate jurisdiction over legal matters , whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could only hear original jurisdictional matters when the amount in controversy was less than $ 50 and did not involve land disputes . Some judges under the Provisional Government were Nathaniel Ford , Peter H. Burnett , Osborne Russell , Ira L. Babcock , and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith . 
 = = = Districts = = = 
 During its existence the Provisional Government 's authority was restricted to the pioneer settlements , generally located in or around the Willamette Valley . The entire Oregon Country was decreed to be covered by four administrative divisions . Initially created on 5 July 1843 were the Twality , Yamhill , Clackamas and Champooick ( later Champoeg ) districts . Yamhill district claimed the lands west of the Willamette River and a line extending from its course , and south of the Yamhill River . Champooick District was adjacent to the east , its northern border the confluence of the Pudding and <unk> Rivers . Twality District was directly north of Yamhill District , its eastern border extending from the mouth of the Willamette River . Clackamas District was to contain " all the territory " that wasn 't decreed a part of the other three districts , located east of Twality District and north of Champooick District . The extent of land claimed north was vague , being " south of the northern boundary of the United States " . Despite this the government was defined to extend over all the lands east to the Rocky Mountains and north of the Mexican territory of Alta California . 
 Throughout 1843 and 1844 , no attempts were made at controlling lands north of the Columbia River , then under the influence of the Hudson 's Bay Company through Fort Vancouver . In June 1844 the Columbia River was declared as the northern border of the Provisional Government , but by December the most expansive American claim in the Oregon boundary dispute of Parallel 54 ° 40 ′ north was adopted . On December 22 , 1845 districts were renamed to counties . Additional districts were created over time from the original four , including the Clatsop , Vancouver , Linn , Clark , Polk , Benton counties .

 Other government positions included Recorder , Treasurer , Attorney , and Sheriff . The recorder position would later become the position of Secretary of State . 
 = = Laws = = 
 Over the course of nearly six years under the provisional government , the settlers passed numerous laws . One law allowed people to claim 640 acres ( 2 @.@ 6 km2 ) if they improved the land , which would be solidified later by Congress ’ adoption of the Donation Land Claim Act . Another law allowed the government to organize a militia and call them out by order of the Executive or Legislature . Under the first Organic Laws of 1843 inhabitants were guaranteed due process of law and a right to a trial by jury . Some other rights established were : no cruel and unusual punishment , no unreasonable bails for defendants , and no takings of property without compensation . 
 In 1844 the legislature decreed that African Americans could not reside in the Oregon Country , only David Hill and Asa Lovejoy voting against the bill . The punishment for any freemen was to be administered every six months of their residency being " not less than twenty nor more than thirty @-@ nine stripes " . The law was never actually enforced and was struck down in July 1845 . However , in 1849 the legislature passed a new law once again prohibiting African Americans in the territory , but differed from the original 1844 law in that it applied to African Americans entering after it was passed , and it used different means to enforce it . Despite facing legal discrimination that denied them suffrage and threatened violence , black pioneers remained in Oregon . While the USS Shark was in the region in 1846 , its commanding officer estimated there were around 30 black settlers . 
 In 1844 , the legislature passed a law banning the sale of ardent spirits , out of concern that the Native Americans would become hostile if intoxicated . 
 = = Finances = = 
 Prior to the creation of the Provisional Government , the economic activities by in the Oregon European descendants Country were focused on the fur trade . A system called " wheat credit " was established in the 1830s for French @-@ Canadian settlers on the French Prairie . The farmers would take their harvests to a granary in Champoeg , where a receipt for its market value was given , valid for use at HBC stores . Another item used for transactions by French @-@ Canadian and later American pioneers were beaver skins . 
 The first Organic Laws only authorised voluntary donations , a measure deemed a " utopian scheme " and provided scant funds . A tax on real estate and personal property was created in 1844 , that covered a third of that year 's expenses . The next year the property tax was doubled to <unk> % and a 50 ¢ poll tax was levied as well , with failure to pay resulting in disenfranchisement . Sheriffs acted as tax collectors , but their position was made difficult due to the poverty or unwillingness of many colonists to pay what was owed . Taxes were paid in wheat and gathered at appointed locations for the district , largely HBC warehouses . 
 A small amount of silver coins from Peru and Mexico freely circulated as legal tender . Minor financial agreements were completed in lieu of currency with assorted agricultural products , such as " wheat , hides , tallow , beef , pork , butter , lard , peas , lumber and other articles of export of the territory . " One pioneer recalled the lack of currency , receiving at most 25 ¢ in transactions between 1844 and 1848 . To overcome the lack of circulating coins , Abernethy gathered scraps of flint left over from arrowhead production by local indigenous . After attaching scraps of paper to them , the amount owed by Abernethy was written on one and given to customers , transferable for other supplies at his store . Coins remained a prized item by settlers for example , during a sale of lots in Oregon City a property manager offered a discount of 50 % if paid in specie . 
 A traveler who visited Oregon before the arrival of American merchants reported that HBC stores sold goods at rates lower than in the United States . As merchants from the United States became established in the region , they chaffed under the economic hegemony of the HBC . The vendors pressed for the HBC to charge more for sales to pioneers , which the company did for two years , only for American customers . Joel Palmer reported that without the British company " the prices would be double what they are now . " 
 The small American merchant class and officers of the HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund . Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat receipts and <unk> issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845 . The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants , who were de facto bankers . Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for wheat became flooded from overproduction , causing a decline in its value . The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847 , making only gold , silver and treasury drafts on valid currency . Thus , the creditors of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing wheat as tender . 
 Around $ 8 @,@ 000 from the poll and property taxes were collected over the course of the government , far short of the expenses amounting to $ 23 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = California = = = 
 After the Conquest of California during the ongoing Mexican @-@ American War , American settlers began to move to the newly seized land . This created a demand for Oregonian wheat , proceeds from the sale barrels of flour amounted to $ 10 per keg in 1847 . The start of the Gold Rush caused an immense rise in demand for various products in Californian markets . Economic transactions with the pioneer settlements of Oregon increased greatly , with the number of visiting vessels in 1849 was triple that of the previous eight years . Between 1848 and 1851 Oregon lumber and wheat sent to the new markets fetched rates two to three times higher than in 1847 . Significant amounts of gold dust began to circulate in the Willamette Valley , though impurities were common . The Oregon Exchange Company was authorized by the legislature to begin producing Beaver Coins in early 1849 , though production began on 10 March , a week after the dissolution of the Provisional Government .

 The mounting debts of the government , though it could " scarcely hope " to force the HBC company posts to adhere to its authority , made establishing an agreement with the HBC a priority . An employee of the Company , Francis <unk> , was elected to the position of Treasurer in July after carrying the French @-@ Canadian vote . In August Applegate inquired to Chief Factor John McLoughlin if the HBC would pay taxes and join the Provisional Government . At the same time a member of the legislature , David Hill , tabled a bill on 15 August that would deny any HBC employees citizenship or suffrage . The measure failed to pass , but demonstrated the feelings of the " Ultra @-@ Americans " towards the Company . 
 While Applegate and McLoughlin held a conference , plans for the administration of the territory above the Columbia River , to be named Vancouver , were begun . The Chief Factor found the Provisional Government a satisfactory way to pursue the debts owed to the HBC by settlers , and protect company property against claim jumpers . Additionally he felt if the government were to openly declare independence from outside powers he could " be elected head were I to retire among them . " The negotiations ended with the condition that only sales with settlers would be taxed . Taxes paid to the Provisional Government by the HBC and the Puget Sound Agricultural Company amounted to $ 226 that year . Several more employees of the HBC were then included in the government . Chief Trader James Douglas was appointed as a justice for Vancouver after the signing of the agreement and in 1846 he and fellow employee Henry Peers were elected to the legislature . If there were any sessions of the Vancouver court , none of the records or correspondence remain . Claims were filed by British subjects covering the HBC forts of Vancouver , Cowlitz , and Nisqually . Vancouver in particular was covered by 18 claims . 
 British reaction to the agreement was generally negative . It was seen as unneeded by William Peel , son of Prime Minister Peel , who arrived with small flotilla several days after its signing . Mervin Vavasour was in the Oregon Country gathering intelligence about the defensive capabilities of the HBC posts and voiced the minority view that the compact was to the benefit of " peace and prosperity of the community at large . "

 The organic laws laid out plans for a militia of a battalion of mounted riflemen commanded by an officer with the rank of major , with annual inspections . Every male settler between 16 and 60 who wanted to be " considered a citizen " had to be a part of the military , failure to do so would incur fines . ( This remains so under modern Oregon law , though now both sexes are included , and the age range is only 18 to 45 . ) Under the first Organic Laws , power to call out the militia was vested in the Executive Committee , though any officer of the militia could also call them out in times of insurrection or invasion .

 In December 1847 , after learning of the Whitman Massacre from HBC Chief Factor James Douglas , Governor Abernethy and the legislature met to discuss the situation . Major Henry A. G. Lee was placed in charge of a company called the Oregon Rifles on December 8 and was ordered to The Dalles . At that location the force established Fort Lee on December 21 . An additional force of 500 men were to meet in Oregon City by December 25 . This group prosecuted the war east of the Cascades under the command of Cornelius Gilliam . 
 The war continued until five Cayuse emissaries , which according to Archbishop François Norbert Blanchet , were sent to " have a talk with the whites and explain all about the murderers , ten in number , who were no more , and had been killed by the whites , the <unk> and were all dead . " However , the Cayuse party was imprisoned and transported to Oregon City . When the group was asked why they offered themselves to the militia , <unk> stated " Did not your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people ? So die we to save our people . " At a military court <unk> and the four other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , were found guilty and hanged on June 3 , 1850 , at Oregon City .

 Signed on June 15 , 1846 , the Oregon Treaty ended the dispute between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States , by dividing the Oregon Country at the 49th parallel . This extended U.S. sovereignty over the region , but effective control would not occur until government officials arrived from the United States . Two years later , on August 14 , 1848 , the United States Congress created the Oregon Territory ; this territory included today 's states of Oregon , Washington , and Idaho , and parts of Montana and Wyoming . Appointed Governor of the Oregon Territory by President Polk , Joseph Lane arrived at Oregon City on 2 March 1849 . 
 Governor Lane kept the legal code of the dissolved the provisional government , only immediately repealing the law authorizing the minting of the Beaver Coins , as this was incompatible with the United States Constitution ( Article I , Section 8 ) . The creation of the Washington Territory in 1854 removed the northern half of the Oregon Territory . Established on 14 February 1859 , the state of Oregon was composed roughly the western half the territory , the remaining eastern section being added to the Washington Territory . 
 U.S. states created in whole or in part from the Oregon Territory

At the start of their trip , they try going through Old Man Pressman 's ( Stewie ) junkyard , only to be chased out by Pressman and his dog Chopper ( Brian ) . As they travel further down the tracks , they are chased across a bridge by a train , which ends up running over Joey 's legs , as does another train that follows closely behind , which effectively cripples him . The others end up going all the way back to Pressman 's junkyard to get him a wheelchair . 
 Upon finding the body ( Meg Griffin ) , they are confronted by the town bully Ace ( Mayor West ) and his gang , consisting of Beast @-@ Man , Mer @-@ Man , and Norm from Cheers , who come to take credit for finding the body . Ace threatens the boys with a knife , but Petey pulls out a gun to intimidate Ace , who swears he will come back for revenge and could get a gun tomorrow . However , since their next meeting will be inevitable , as they live in the same neighborhood , Petey lets Ace have the body to avoid further consequences .

 Famed writer Paul Sheldon ( Brian ) has just finished his latest and final installment in his series entitled Snuggly Jeff , a series of children 's books in which he kills off the titular character so he can focus on more serious work , despite objections from his agent , Marcia ( Lois ) . While driving through a snowstorm , Paul accidentally hits Stephen King with his car , causing Paul to swerve off the road and crash into a snowbank , while King gets the idea for another novel within seconds and manages to finish writing the plot in just a few seconds before hitting the ground completely unscathed . 
 Paul is rescued by Stewie Wilkes ( Stewie ) , Paul 's self @-@ proclaimed number @-@ one fan , who takes the injured Paul to his remote cabin . Upon finding and reading the manuscript of Paul 's latest Snuggly Jeff book , Stewie is infuriated about the main character 's death and forces Paul to rewrite it and bring Snuggly Jeff back to life , holding him hostage until he manages to do so . Stewie rejects the idea of bringing Snuggly Jeff back to life with a child 's wish , calling it bad storytelling and comparing it to a plot hole in the film Contact . 
 After sending Stewie out for more paper , Paul finds several news articles in an album that imply Wilkes is actually a serial killer . Just then , the local sheriff ( Joe ) appears , and is surprised to find Paul there . Before he can help him , however , Stewie blows his legs off with a shotgun . The sheriff then complains that he will now have to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair , only to be shot again and killed by Stewie . Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go , but Stewie refuses , knowing he will try to turn him in to the police and tell them he kidnapped him , held him hostage , and <unk> him in his sleep , which Paul did not know originally .

 = = = The Shawshank Redemption = = = 
 Andy Dufresne ( Peter ) is sent to Shawshank Prison , though none of the inmates think much of him , particularly Red ( Cleveland , who narrates the story ) . A month passes before Andy literally says two words to Red , and later asks him for a rock hammer , claiming he carves Star Wars figurines out of stone . He also suggests in a poorly veiled manner that he will use the hammer to tunnel out of the prison . Andy and Red end up becoming fast friends , and Red provides him with the rock hammer . One day , the prison 's stern warden Samuel Norton ( Carter ) takes a liking to Andy 's figurines and offers to sell them so he can take all the money for himself , crippling Bogs ( Joe ) , one of the inmates who had raped Andy in the shower , as a sign of good will ( despite Andy saying that he liked him ) . Andy is then given permission to clean Norton 's office , and , while doing so , plays a record of " Hollaback Girl " across the whole prison , which utterly confuses all the inmates and infuriates Norton , who calls Andy into his office and places him in solitary confinement for two months after Andy indirectly insults him . 
 Afterward , Andy grows determined to escape from Shawshank , and informs Red that he is going to Zihuatanejo in Mexico , telling him that if he should ever get out of prison , he should go to a <unk> in Buxton , Maine , and there will be a volcanic rock , and a gift for him under it . During an inspection the next day , Andy has disappeared without a trace . In a fury , Norton throws one of Andy 's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy 's cell , tearing a hole through Cassidy 's rectum . Norton then pulls the poster off , discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before . Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends , allowing him to crawl out to freedom . Sometime later , Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important , and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released ; for no apparent reason , Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank . Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy , finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about ; unfortunately , to Red 's annoyance , he does not . Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo , eagerly waiting for Red to arrive , though Red never does . 
 At the end of the show , Peter thanks Stephen King and says they will see him in court , then tells the viewers to " stay tuned for whatever FOX is limping to the barn with . "

 In his second episode for the season , the first being " Stew @-@ Roids " , the episode was written by series regular Alec Sulkin , and directed by Dominic Bianchi before the conclusion of the seventh production season . It was the last episode to be <unk> in animatics . 
 The three stories were chosen , according to series creator Seth MacFarlane , mostly due to their " iconic " movie stature . Before producing the episode , writer Stephen King was approached by the Family Guy production team to create the episode , and obtain his written permission to create it ; with King agreeing to allow the show to create the parody . King later stated that he enjoyed the episode and found it funny . 
 In addition to the regular cast , actor Richard Dreyfuss , actor Roy Scheider ( who recorded his part in the episode shortly before his death in February 2008 ) , and actor George Wendt guest starred in the episode . Recurring guest voice actors Chris Cox , actor Ralph Garman , writer Danny Smith , writer Alec Sulkin , and writer John Viener also made minor appearances .

 The episode received generally positive reviews from television sources and critics . Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode an 8 @.@ 4 / 10 , calling the change of pace from the show 's usual random storytelling " pleasant " . The Misery segment was criticized as being flat , but was made up for by the other two , particularly The Shawshank Redemption . Steve Heisler of The A.V.

He called Misery a " hoot " , stating : " Anything where Brian is held in the palm of diabolical Stewie works wonders for me " . 
 = I Love Bees = 
 I Love Bees ( also known as ilovebees or ILB for short ) was an alternate reality game ( ARG ) that served as both a real @-@ world experience and viral marketing campaign for the release of developer Bungie 's 2004 video game Halo 2 . The game was created and developed by 42 Entertainment . Many of the same personnel had previously created an ARG for the film A.I. titled The Beast . I Love Bees was commissioned by Microsoft , Halo 2 's publisher . 
 I Love Bees was first advertised by a hidden message in a Halo 2 trailer ; players who investigated the titular website discovered that the pages appeared to be hacked by a mysterious intelligence . As players solved puzzles , audio logs were posted to the ilovebees.com site which gradually revealed more of the fictional back @-@ story , involving a marooned artificial intelligence stranded on Earth and its attempts to put itself back together . 250 @,@ 000 people viewed the ilovebees website when it was launched in August 2004 , and more than 500 @,@ 000 returned to the site every time the pages were updated . More than three million visitors viewed the site over the course of three months , and thousands of people around the world participated in the game . I Love Bees won numerous awards for its innovation and helped spawn numerous other alternate reality games for video games . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Alternate reality games or ARGs are designed to involve fans of video games or other media in a form of viral marketing which CNET described as encompassing " real @-@ life treasure hunting , interactive storytelling , video games and online [ communities ] " . I Love Bees began when jars of honey were received in the mail by people who had previously participated in alternate reality games . The jars contained letters leading to the I Love Bees website and a countdown . At around the same time , theatrical trailers for Halo 2 concluded with the Xbox logo and a URL , Xbox.com , that quickly flashed a link to ilovebees.com , ostensibly a hacked site related to beekeeping . 
 Both events , not connected publicly for several weeks , caused the curious to visit the website <unk> The site , which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping , was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments . Dana , the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site , created a weblog stating that something had gone wrong with her website , and the site itself had been hacked . Suspecting that this was a mystery that could be unraveled , Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on . 
 The gameplay of I Love Bees tasked players around the world to work together to solve problems , with little or no direction or guidance . For example , the game presented players with 210 pairs of global positioning system coordinates and time codes , with no indications to what the locations referred to . Players eventually figured out the coordinates referred to pay phones and the times to when the phones would ring ; one player in Florida stayed by a phone while Hurricane Frances was minutes away in order to recite answers to prerecorded questions . Other phone calls were made by live persons known as " operators " ; these calls allowed players to interact with the characters of the games in spontaneous and occasionally humorous ways . Other players treated the corrupted data on ilovebees.com as encrypted files to decipher , or used image files found on the web server to solve puzzles . After players completed certain tasks , they were rewarded with new installments to an audio drama which revealed the reasons for the ilovebees.com malfunction . 
 Over time , the game 's mechanisms for contacting players grew more complex . Players were sent messages via email , called on their cell phones , and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters . The game culminated by inviting players of the game to visit one of four cinemas where they could get a chance to play Halo 2 before its release and collect a commemorative DVD . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game 's plot begins with a military spaceship crashing to Earth in an unknown location , leaving the craft 's controlling artificial intelligence or AI damaged . This AI , known as the " Operator " or " Melissa " ( from the Latin for " very sweet , " etymologically akin to Latin melis , " honey " ) , is not alone ; other AI programs share its system . In an effort to survive and contact any surviving allies , Melissa transfers herself to a San Francisco @-@ area web server , which happens to host a bee enthusiast website known as I Love Bees . To the distress of Dana <unk> , the website 's maintainer , Melissa 's attempts to send signals began to appear largely as codes , hidden in images or other text , interfering with the operation of the I Love Bees site and corrupting much of the content . 
 Dana , attempting to regain control over the corrupted website , accidentally erases data which comprises part of Melissa 's memory . Furious , Melissa lashes out at the webmaster , obtaining pictures of her using the webcam on her computer and promising to take revenge . Alarmed , Dana announces that she is removing herself from the situation and is taking a previously planned trip to China earlier than expected . 
 All AI units contain a program called <unk> , short for System Peril Distributed Reflex . As <unk> attempts to fix Melissa , random dumps from Melissa 's memory began to spill into the website , largely detailing Melissa 's history and revealing the presence of a malicious Trojan @-@ horse virus known as the " Pious Flea . " The Spider tries to erase the Flea but is outwitted , as Melissa erases the Spider instead of the Flea . The Flea continues to overwrite Melissa 's programming with its own mysterious goals , with it eventually being revealed that it is actually an espionage AI more properly called the Seeker , built by the Covenant . 
 With the assistance of other characters revealed by audio chapters , the fictional protagonists break into a secure military installation and manage to deactivate a Forerunner device which is implied to begin the firing sequence of the Halo installations . However , the price paid for the deactivation is a powerful energy transmission alerting the Covenant to the location of Earth . Whole again , Melissa sees how she has been manipulated by the Pious Flea , and returns to her time . I Love Bees ends with the Covenant invading Earth , corresponding to a major plot point in Halo 2 . 
 Due to Bungie 's commitment to the development of Halo 2 during I Love Bees ' run , they were unable to assist 42 Entertainment with story creation , and so the ARG 's story is only tangentially related to the main Halo storyline . The events of I Love Bees were , therefore , originally not considered to be Halo canon . In a 2006 interview , however , Bungie 's content manager Frank O 'Connor expressly confirmed that I Love Bees is part of " things that we embrace as canon . " References to elements of I Love Bees have since appeared in the 2006 Halo Graphic Novel and the 2009 Halo Encyclopedia , both of which are official canon . 
 = = Development = = 
 I Love Bees ' developer , 42 Entertainment , was founded by Jordan Weisman , the former creative director for Microsoft 's Xbox division . 42 Entertainment had previously created the first ARG , The Beast , which had been used to promote the movie A.I .. Other members of the I Love Bees team included Sean Stewart , a World Fantasy Award @-@ award @-@ winning author who served as I Love Bees ' writer , and Jim <unk> , I Love Bees ' technical lead who produced the first commercial 3D game delivered by the internet . Weisman stated that the goal of I Love Bees was to utilize every person who interacted with the game , and to use any electronic resource to do so : " If we could make your toaster print something we would . Anything with an electric current running through it . A single story , a single gaming experience , with no boundaries . A game that is life itself . " 
 42 Entertainment conceived I Love Bees as a radio drama , and used the pay phones as a way to excite players . Chris Di Cesare , Microsoft 's director of marketing , stated that the radio drama 's similarities with War of the Worlds was intentional , and that " [ ILB ] remains true to the radio drama tradition of Orson Welles that we were shooting for and also allowed us to tell the story in an unorthodox way . " In order to prevent non @-@ players from being scared by the sounds of gunfire from the pay phones , 42 Entertainment established passwords that had to be repeated . Stewart described writing for the game as more enjoyable than writing printed fiction , both for the money and the unique experience of ARGs as opposed to other media : 
 The audiences that we built for those campaigns are having a different experience . They ’ re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces , one to the next , swap them back and forth , gossip about them . They have an element of <unk> and a collaborative nature that doesn ’ t really have an analog that I ’ ve been able to think of in the arts .

 I Love Bees is credited with helping drive attention to Halo 2 ; former Electronic Gaming Monthly editor Dan Hsu stated in an interview that " I Love Bees really got existing gamers and other consumers talking about the universe of [ Halo ] . " Billy Pidgeon , a game analyst , noted that I Love Bees achieved what it had been designed to do : " This kind of viral guerrilla marketing worked ... Everyone started instant messaging about it and checking out the site . " I Love Bees not only received coverage from gaming publications , but attracted mainstream press attention as well . At its height , ilovebees received between two and three million unique visitors over the course of three months . 9 @,@ 000 people also actively participated in the real @-@ world aspects of the game . The players of I Love Bees themselves were quite varied . The target demographic for the promotion was younger males , but one player noted that even middle @-@ aged men and women were engaged in the game . 
 I Love Bees received several awards for its innovation . The design team was one of the recipients of the Innovation Award at the 5th annual Game Developers Choice Awards . I Love Bees was also announced as the winner of a Webby Award in the Game @-@ Related category , presented by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences .

 Along with 42 Entertainment 's previous ARG known as The Beast , I Love Bees is credited with bringing greater attention to the fledgling marketing form ; I Love Bees not only helped assuage fears by marketers about the costs of ARG failure , but attracted interest from other game developers in using alternate reality games to promote their own products . Before I Love Bees , The Guardian stated that " ARGs were destined to join <unk> and Barcode Battlers in the e @-@ dustbin of nice ideas that never really caught on " ; the explosion of broadband internet access and a renewed interest in codes allowed I Love Bees to become wildly successful . Bungie would later use another ARG called " Iris " to promote Halo 2 's sequel , Halo 3 . 
 I Love Bees also attracted attention in the wider discussion of user @-@ based marketing and cooperation . Author Charles Leadbeater argued that I Love Bees was an example of " We @-@ Think " collective thinking ; Leadbeater noted that after the " puppet masters " began the game , I Love Bees " displayed all the characteristics of a mass movement , propelled into existence in a matter of weeks simply by collective enthusiasm guided by a few cyberspace ' avatars ' " . The game proved successful with gamers , as well as attracting nontraditional players who had no experience with Halo before joining the game . 
 = Flocabulary = 
 Flocabulary is a Brooklyn @-@ based company that creates educational hip hop songs , videos and additional materials for students in grades K @-@ 12 . Founded in 2004 by Blake Harrison and Alex Rappaport , the company takes a nontraditional approach to teaching vocabulary , United States history , math , science and other subjects by integrating content into recorded raps . Flocabulary 's website features videos , lesson plans , activities and assessments . 
 The company has emphasized outreach to underprivileged schools in its business decisions . As of 2015 , more than 35 @,@ 000 schools use Flocabulary products in the classroom . Flocabulary has been praised by rapper Snoop Dogg ( AKA Snoop Lion ) and historian Howard Zinn , and the company 's products have been generally well received by educators and the press . However , the project has been criticized for perceived cultural inauthenticity and politically charged material in some song lyrics . 
 = = History = = 
 Blake Harrison conceived of the idea that would become Flocabulary while in high school . Inspired by hip hop artists like Outkast and A Tribe Called Quest , Harrison wanted to combine the easy <unk> of hip hop lyrics with educational content . Harrison graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English . He then moved to San Francisco , where he met Alex Rappaport , a music graduate of Tufts University . Harrison shared his idea with Rappaport , and in 2004 the two made a demo recording of two songs with a combined total of 80 SAT words . Within two months <unk> made the songs available for free streaming , and soon afterward Harrison and Rappaport set up a Flocabulary website . Cider Mill Press published Flocabulary books and distributed them through Sterling Publishing to sell the book at Barnes & Noble and Borders stores . The Hip Hop Approach to SAT Vocabulary sold 10 @,@ 000 copies in its first year of publication and was reprinted five times . In 2005 , Flocabulary went on a promotional tour of concerts at schools . 
 By early 2006 , Flocabulary began self @-@ publishing its products . Harrison and Rappaport raised $ 50 @,@ 000 from family and friends and began visiting schools and education conferences to sell their products . Flocabulary entered into a contest for startup businesses at Columbia Business School and won a social value award . After participating in a collaborative business advice program with Columbia students , Harrison and Rappaport decided to stop self @-@ publishing and returned to Cider Mill . Flocabulary raised $ 110 @,@ 000 from investors and hired 30 sales representatives . In September 2007 , a line of Flocabulary products was released called " Word Up " for teaching standardized test vocabulary . 
 Word Up ! proved successful and helped to double their annual revenue in 2008 to $ 600 @,@ 000 . Flocabulary 's 2007 release Shakespeare Is Hip @-@ Hop featured musical and lyrical contributions from a number of hip hop artists , including Grammy Award @-@ winner 9th Wonder . In 2008 , Harrison and Rappaport created The Week in Rap , a weekly series of songs that has covered current events including the 2008 presidential election and the results of California Proposition 8 . By 2009 , Flocabulary made $ 900 @,@ 000 in annual revenue . 
 Rappaport says that Flocabulary has made access to its products a priority over profitability , saying , " We wanted to reach the kids who might never get to the SATs , whose families weren 't buying books at Barnes & Noble . " According to Rappaport , Flocabulary has made " social responsibility a core value [ of the company ] and never [ let ] it get overshadowed by our revenue goals , " and , " we 're trying to make this as affordable as possible , because unfortunately the schools with money aren 't necessarily the schools that need Flocabulary . So we 're trying to work with some government organizations and other charities to really get these into the schools that need them . " Flocabulary 's non @-@ profitable social projects have included charitable donations and outreach to underprivileged schools . 
 In September 2010 , the use of Flocabulary was postponed in Oklahoma City Public Schools after several teachers voiced concern over some of the lyrics in the program . The lyrics to the song " Old Dead White Men " drew complaints for referring to the Founding Fathers of the United States as dead white males , a term used to criticize perceived disproportionate emphasis on the contributions of historical European males . The lyrics to " <unk> " also compare Andrew Jackson 's policy of Indian removal to Adolf Hitler 's Final Solution . Rappaport responded that the materials were meant to keep the students engaged and promote discussion , but the company has since replaced the song on its site . Tucker Carlson said Flocabulary was a " get @-@ educated @-@ quick [ scheme ] " that disregards historical " context or accuracy " , and said " there are still no independent studies that demonstrate rapping about social studies is any more educational than rapping about sex or gunfights . " Carlson particularly noted what he saw as over @-@ simplification of the African @-@ American Civil Rights Movement in the song " Let Freedom Ring " . 
 By June 2016 , when Flocabulary raised a $ 1 @.@ 5 million convertible note from Rethink Education , the company had produced more than 725 educational rap videos . [ 1 ]

 School Library Journal notes that , " [ Flocabulary 's ] catchy songs hook K @-@ 12 students in a way that textbooks can 't . " A reporter for The Wall Street Journal visited classrooms where Flocabulary was being used and remarked that , " When third @-@ grade teachers asked questions about the videos and vocabulary , the problem wasn ’ t getting children to raise their hands , but to put them down . " A reporter for <unk> writes that " As a lesson supplement , it gets the job done — not every memory tool inspires comments like " <unk> " on YouTube . " Academics Howard Zinn and Cornel West endorsed Hip @-@ Hop U.S. History . Menchville High reported that use of Flocabulary increased SAT scores from 420 to 477 , though the principle said the school can 't verify to what extent Flocabulary did or didn 't have an influence . A study conducted across six US states by former International Reading Association president Roger Farr demonstrated improvement in reading and writing skills among middle schools students who studied with Flocabulary . Proficiency increased by more than 20 percent . Snoop Dogg has expressed support for the company 's products . Jack Rosenthal of The New York Times says that Flocabulary is " one example of how Web sites have latched onto mnemonics as ways to teach SAT words to high @-@ school students . " In November 2014 , <unk> reporter Laura <unk> called a video about credit cards in Flocabulary ’ s financial literacy series “ direct , clear and insanely catchy . ” Common Sense Media notes that , " One of Flocabulary 's best qualities is that the songs sound like real rap songs , not an embarrassing facsimile that 's obviously for educational purposes . The backing beats and samples are catchy and memorable , and videos contain a fun combo of stock footage , original animation , and , for The Week in Rap , current news clips . " In the book Slam School : Learning Through Conflict in the Hip @-@ Hop and Spoken Word Classroom Bronwen Low , while praising Flocabulary and similar programs for incorporating hip hop into American schools , argues that Flocabulary is culturally inauthentic and refers to Flocabulary 's methods as a gimmick . Similarly , while the book The Anthology of Rap supports Shakespeare Is Hip Hop as an " effective and entertaining [ tool ] " , the author said Flocabulary failed to " illuminate rap 's distinct poetic tradition .

This globally distributed species has been reported down to a depth of 3 @,@ 675 m ( 12 @,@ 057 ft ) , making it the deepest @-@ living shark known . It inhabits lower continental slopes and abyssal plains , usually staying near the bottom . Stocky and dark brown in color , the Portuguese dogfish can be distinguished from similar @-@ looking species ( such as the kitefin shark , Dalatias licha ) by the small spines in front of its dorsal fins . Its dermal denticles are also unusual , resembling the scales of a bony fish . This species typically reaches 0 @.@ 9 – 1 m ( 3 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 3 ft ) in length ; sharks in the Mediterranean Sea are much smaller and have distinct depth and food preferences . 
 Relatively common , the Portuguese dogfish is an active hunter capable of tackling fast , large prey . It feeds mainly on cephalopods and fishes , though it also consumes invertebrates and cetacean carrion . This shark has acute vision optimized for detecting the bioluminescence of its prey , as sunlight does not reach the depths at which it lives . The Portuguese dogfish is aplacental viviparous , with the young provisioned by yolk and perhaps uterine fluid . The females give birth to up to 29 young after a gestation period of over one year . Valued for its liver oil and to a lesser extent meat , Portuguese dogfish are important to deepwater commercial fisheries operating off Portugal , the British Isles , Japan , and Australia . These fishing pressures and the low reproductive rate of this species have led the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) to assess it as Near Threatened .

 The first scientific description of the Portuguese dogfish was published by Portuguese zoologists José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage and Félix António de Brito Capello , in an 1864 issue of Proceedings of the General Meetings for Scientific Business of the Zoological Society of London . They created the new genus Centroscymnus for this shark , and gave it the specific epithet coelolepis , derived from the Greek koilos ( " hollow " ) and lepidos ( " fish scale " ) and referring to the structure of the dermal denticles . The type specimen , caught off Portugal , has since been destroyed in a fire . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 One of the widest @-@ ranging deepwater sharks , the Portuguese dogfish is patchily distributed around the world . In the western Atlantic , it occurs from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to the U.S. state of Delaware . In the eastern Atlantic , it is found from Iceland to Sierra Leone , including the western Mediterranean Sea , the Azores and Madeira , as well as from southern Namibia to western South Africa . In the Indian Ocean , this species has been caught off the Seychelles . In the Pacific , this shark occurs off Japan , New Zealand , and Australia from Cape Hawke , New South Wales , to <unk> , South Australia , including Tasmania . 
 The deepest @-@ living shark known , the Portuguese dogfish has been reported at depths of 150 m ( 490 ft ) to 3 @,@ 675 m ( 12 @,@ 057 ft ) from the lower continental slope to the abyssal plain , and is most common between 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) and 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . This species is found deeper in the Mediterranean , seldom occurring above a depth of 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) and being most common at 2 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 m ( 8 @,@ 200 – 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . The deep Mediterranean has a relatively constant temperature of 13 ° C ( 55 ° F ) and a salinity of 38 @.@ 4 ppt , whereas in the deep ocean the temperature is generally only 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) and the salinity 34 – 35 ppt . The Portuguese dogfish is essentially benthic in nature , though young sharks can be found a considerable distance off the bottom . There is depth segregation by size and sex ; pregnant females are found in shallower water , above 1 @,@ 200 – 1 @,@ 500 m ( 3 @,@ 900 – 4 @,@ 900 ft ) , while juveniles are found deeper . There may be several separate populations in the Atlantic , and sharks in the Mediterranean and off Japan appear to be distinct as well .

 The Portuguese dogfish typically reaches a length of 0 @.@ 9 m ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) for males and 1 @.@ 0 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) for females , though specimens up to 1 @.@ 2 m ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) long have been recorded . Sharks in the Mediterranean are smaller , growing no more than 65 cm ( 26 in ) long . This species has a flattened , broadly rounded snout that is shorter than the mouth is wide . The nostrils are preceded by short flaps of skin . The eyes are large and oval in shape , positioned laterally on the head and equipped with a reflective tapetum lucidum that produces a yellow @-@ green " eye shine " . The mouth is wide and slightly arched , with moderately thick , smooth lips and short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws . The upper teeth are slender and upright with a single cusp , numbering 43 – 68 rows . The lower teeth have a short , strongly angled cusp and number 29 – 41 rows ; their bases interlock to form a continuous cutting surface . The five pairs of gill slits are short and nearly vertical . 
 The body of the Portuguese dogfish is thick and cylindrical except for the flattened belly . The two dorsal fins are small and of similar size and shape , each bearing a tiny grooved spine in front . The first dorsal fin originates well behind the pectoral fins , while the second dorsal originates over the middle of the pelvic fin bases . The pectoral fins are medium @-@ sized with a rounded margin . There is no anal fin . The caudal fin has a short but well @-@ developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe . The very large dermal denticles change in shape with age : in juveniles , they are widely spaced and heart @-@ shaped with an incomplete midline ridge and three posterior points , while in adults they are overlapping , roughly circular , smooth , and flattened with a round central concavity , superficially resembling the scales of bony fishes . Young sharks are a uniform blue @-@ black in color , while adults are brown @-@ black ; there are no prominent fin markings . In 1997 , a partially albino individual , with a pale body but normal eyes , was caught in the northeastern Atlantic . This represented the first documented case of albinism in a deep @-@ sea shark . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Living almost exclusively in the aphotic zone where little to no sunlight penetrates , the Portuguese dogfish is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters . The large , squalene @-@ rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover with minimal effort ; males contain more squalene in their livers than females . A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight has found that the Portuguese dogfish has an average swimming speed of 0 @.@ 072 m / s ( 0 @.@ 24 ft / s ) , and does not remain in any particular area for long . This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks . Known parasites of this species include monogeneans in the genus <unk> , and the tapeworms <unk> viridis , S. <unk> , and Anthobothrium sp . 
 An active predator of mobile , relatively large organisms , the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods ( including <unk> spp . ) and bony fishes ( including <unk> , orange roughy , lantern fishes , and rattails ) . It has also been known to take other sharks and invertebrates ( such as the medusa <unk> <unk> ) , as well as scavenging from whale carcasses . The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other <unk> sharks : in addition to having a large pupil and lens , and a tapetum lucidum , its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center ; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane . The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence : the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey , such as the squids <unk> dispar , Histioteuthis spp . , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . 
 In the Mediterranean sea , the Portuguese dogfish is one of the most common deepwater sharks along with the blackmouth catshark ( Galeus melastomus ) and the velvet belly lantern shark ( Etmopterus spinax ) , and the only shark abundant below a depth of 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) . By inhabiting deeper water , Portuguese dogfish in the Mediterranean may reduce competition with the other two species . The smaller size of Mediterranean sharks relative to those from the rest of the world may be due to limited food availability and / or the warmer , saltier environment . Some 87 % of the diet of Portuguese dogfish in the Mediterranean consists of cephalopods . Bony fishes are a secondary food source , while immature sharks favor the shrimp <unk> eximia , the most common decapod crustacean in their environment . Unlike in other regions , Mediterranean sharks seldom scavenge . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 The Portuguese dogfish is aplacental viviparous , with the female retaining eggs internally until they hatch . The embryos are sustained by yolk , and possibly also by uterine fluid secreted by the mother . Figueiredo et al . ( 2008 ) reported that there are two breeding seasons per year off Portugal , from January to May and from August to December , with only a fraction of the population reproductively active at a time . However , previous accounts have described continuous reproduction with females in various stages of pregnancy present year @-@ round . The ovarian follicles take some time to mature ; they are ovulated into the uterus at a diameter of 5 – 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) . Studies of females have found no traces of sperm inside their reproductive tracts , which suggests that fertilization occurs immediately following copulation , which may also trigger ovulation . The reproductive cycles of Portuguese dogfish in the Atlantic and Pacific are generally similar ; sharks off Japan tend to produce larger numbers of smaller oocytes than elsewhere , while sharks off the British Isles exhibit a larger litter size and birth size ( but smaller oocytes ) than those off Portugal . There is a record of a hermaphroditic specimen with an ovary on its right side and a testis on its left . 
 Early in development , the embryos are sexually undifferentiated , unpigmented , and possess filamentous external gills ; the external yolk sac in this stage weighs 120 – 130 g ( 4 @.@ 2 – 4 @.@ 6 oz ) . <unk> sex organs develop by an embryonic length of 92 mm ( 3 @.@ 6 in ) , and tissue differentiation is complete by a length of 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) . Body pigmentation appears when the embryo is 100 – 150 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) long ; the external gills regress at around the same time . An internal yolk sac develops when the embryo is 140 mm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) long , which begins to take in yolk as the external yolk sac shrinks ; by the time the embryo is 233 – 300 mm ( 9 @.@ 2 – 11 @.@ 8 in ) long the external yolk sac has been completely resorbed . Off Portugal , the young seem to be born in May and December following a gestation period of over a year . As they near giving birth , the females undergo ovarian atresia ( regression of the follicles ) , suggesting that they enter a resting period afterwards . The litter size ranges from 1 to 29 ( typically 12 ) , and is not correlated with female size . Parturition may occur in a yet @-@ unknown nursery area , as newborns are rarely ever caught . The length at birth has been reported as 23 – 30 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 – 11 @.@ 8 in ) in the Atlantic , and 30 – 35 cm ( 12 – 14 in ) in the Pacific . 
 Aside from the distinctive Mediterranean population , Portuguese dogfish attain sexual maturity at similar sizes around the world : males and females mature at 90 – 101 cm ( 35 – 40 in ) and 85 – 115 cm ( 33 – 45 in ) respectively off the Iberian Peninsula , 86 cm ( 34 in ) and 102 cm ( 40 in ) respectively west of the British Isles , 70 cm ( 28 in ) and 95 – 100 cm ( 37 – 39 in ) respectively in Suruga Bay , Japan , and 82 – 90 cm ( 32 – 35 in ) and 99 – 110 cm ( 39 – 43 in ) respectively off southeastern Australia . In the Mediterranean , males mature at around 53 cm ( 21 in ) long . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The Portuguese dogfish is too small and occurs too deep to pose a danger to humans . This species has long been commercially fished , using hook @-@ and @-@ line , gillnets , and trawls . It is mainly valued for its liver , which contains 22 – 49 % squalene by weight and is processed for vitamins . The meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption , or converted into fishmeal . An important fishery for the Portuguese dogfish exists in Suruga Bay for liver oil ; catches peaked during World War II , but declined soon after from over @-@ exploitation . In the past few years , catches by the South East Trawl Fishery off Australia have been increasing , as fishers have been seeking out species not covered by commercial quotas following the relaxation of seafood mercury regulations . Shark landings in this fishery are affected by a prohibition on landing livers without the rest of the carcass . 
 Until recently , Portugal was the only European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish . An important bycatch of the black scabbardfish ( <unk> carbo ) longline fishery , between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999 . Its per @-@ weight value has been increasing since 1986 , and thus exploitation is likely to continue . Around 1990 , French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and <unk> <unk> sharks ( Centrophorus squamosus ) west of the British Isles for meat and livers ; these two species are together referred to as <unk> . The <unk> catch peaked at 3 @,@ 284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1 @,@ 939 tons in 1999 . The French have since been joined by Norwegian , Irish , and Scottish longliners and trawlers , making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic . While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now , stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years ; this may reflect the disparity between the less <unk> Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as Near Threatened , because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity . 
 = And the Band Played On = 
 And the Band Played On : Politics , People , and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle journalist Randy Shilts . In it , Shilts chronicles the discovery and spread of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting — specifically in the United States — to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease . Shilts ' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen : while AIDS is caused by a biological agent , incompetence and apathy toward those who were initially affected by AIDS allowed the spread of the disease to become much worse . 
 The book is an extensive work of investigative journalism , written in the form of an encompassing time line ; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter @-@ of @-@ fact summaries . Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay , medical , and political communities . Shilts begins his discussion in the late 1970s with the then @-@ first confirmed case of AIDS , that of Grethe Rask , a Danish doctor working in Africa . He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS , when international attention on the disease exploded . 
 And the Band Played On was critically acclaimed and became a best @-@ seller . Judith <unk> of the Library Journal called it " one of the most important books of the year " , upon its release . It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community . He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release , saying , " Any good reporter could have done this story , but I think the reason I did it , and no one else did , is because I am gay . It was happening to people I cared about and loved . " The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993 . Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book ; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Shilts decided to write And the Band Played On after attending an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS . As described in the book , television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke : " What 's the hardest part about having AIDS ? Trying to convince your wife that you 're Haitian . " Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it " says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS . Bill Kurtis felt that he could go in front of a journalists ' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes . First of all , he could assume that nobody there would be gay and , if they were gay , they wouldn 't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that . To me , that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media . Obviously , the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that , to me , it was never something that happened to those other people . " 
 After publication of the book , Shilts explained his use of the title : " And the Band Played On is simply a snappier way of saying ' business as usual ' . Everyone responded with an ordinary pace to an extraordinary situation . " 
 = = Summary = = 
 Shilts focuses on several organizations and communities that were either hit hardest by AIDS — and were given the " <unk> " task of finding the cause of the disease — or begging the government for money to fund research and provide social services to people who were dying . He often uses an omniscient point of view to portray individuals ' thoughts and feelings . 
 = = = Gay community = = = 
 AIDS in the United States first struck gay men and IV drug users in Los Angeles , New York City , and San Francisco due to unsafe sexual and drug @-@ taking practices . Shilts ' sources in the gay community tried to remember the last time everyone they knew was healthy , which was the U.S. Bicentennial celebration in 1976 , when sailors came from all over the world to New York . Some of them carried sexually transmitted diseases and rare tropical fevers . A marked difference in these cities arose in two phases of consciousness in the gay community : " Before " in 1980 , and " After " by 1985 . " Before " , according to Shilts , was characterized by a care @-@ free innocence , preceding the period when gay men were aware of a deadly infectious disease . " After " signified the realization that gay men knew most or all of their friends were infected with AIDS , and the syndrome became pervasive throughout the media . 
 In San Francisco , particularly in the Castro District , gay community politicians such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980 . The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease , linked it to certain sexual practices , and made recommendations — stop having sex — to gay men to avoid getting sick , a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro , and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years . Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two @-@ fronted battle : against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected such an undesirable population as gay men , and the gay men themselves , who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior . 
 In New York City , men like Larry Kramer and Paul Popham , who had previously shown no desire for leadership , were forced by bureaucratic apathy into forming the Gay Men 's Health Crisis to raise money for medical research and to provide social services for scores of gay men who began getting sick with opportunistic infections . Shilts describes the desperate actions of the group to get recognition by Mayor Ed Koch and assistance from the city 's Public Health Department to provide social services and preventive education about AIDS and unsafe sex . 
 In these cities , however , the sizable gay communities in most instances were responsible for raising the most money for research , providing the money for and subsequently the social services for the dying , and educating themselves and other high @-@ risk groups . Larry Kramer would go on to form AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ( ACT @-@ UP ) , a political activist organization that forced government and media to pay attention to AIDS . Cleve Jones formed the <unk> Project that created the AIDS Memorial Quilt , the largest folk art display in the world . 
 = = = Medical community = = = 
 Doctors were the first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States . Some — like Marcus Conant , James Curran , Arye Rubenstein , Michael S. Gottlieb , and Mathilde <unk> — would also realize their professional life 's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses , most notably lymphadenopathy , pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , Kaposi 's Sarcoma , toxoplasmosis , cytomegalovirus , <unk> , and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a nonexistent immune system . With no information on how the disease was spread , hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients , and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all . 
 Shilts praised the Public Health Department of San Francisco 's handling of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms , although some of them were living in different parts of the country . He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little , specifically when Public Health Director David <unk> refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was handling it sufficiently . 
 Around the same time gay men were getting sick in the U.S. , doctors in Paris , France , were receiving patients who were African or who had lived in Africa with the same symptoms as Americans . Parisian researchers Jean @-@ Claude <unk> , Françoise Barre , Luc Montagnier , and doctor Willy <unk> began taking biopsies of HIV @-@ infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus . As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV , French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute , where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus . The colleague switched the samples , Shilts reported , because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute . Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples , he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample , putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year . 
 Departmental ego and pride , according to Shilts , also confounded research as the Centers for Disease Control and the National Cancer Institutes battled over funding and who might get credit for medical discoveries that were to come from the isolation of HIV , blood tests to find HIV , or any possible vaccine . Once AIDS became known as a " gay disease " there was particular difficulty for many doctors in different specialties to get other medical professionals to acknowledge that AIDS could be transmitted to people who were not gay , such as infants born from drug @-@ using mothers , children and adults who had hemophilia ( and later , their wives ) , Haitians , and people who had received blood transfusions . 
 The discovery of AIDS in the nation 's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by the blood banking leadership occurred as early as 1982 , yet not until 1985 , when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , did blood bank industry leaders acknowledge that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions . Shilts ' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for hepatitis alone might offend the donors , and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible . 
 = = = Political and governmental agencies = = = 
 The Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , the agency responsible for tracking down and reporting all communicable diseases in the U.S. , faced governmental apathy in the face of mounting crisis . Shilts reported how CDC epidemiologists forged ahead blindly after being denied funding for researching the disease repeatedly . Shilts expressed particular frustration describing instances of the CDC fighting with itself over how much time and attention was being paid to AIDS issues . 
 Although Reagan Administration officials like Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler and Assistant Secretary Edward Brandt spoke publicly about the epidemic , calling it in 1983 its " Number One Health Priority " no extra funding was given to the Centers for Disease Control or the National Institutes of Health for research . What the U.S. Congress pushed through was highly politicized and embattled , and a fraction of what was spent on similar public health problems . 
 Shilts made comparisons to the government 's disparate reaction to the Chicago Tylenol murders , and the recent emergence of Legionnaire 's Disease in 1977 . In October 1982 , seven people died after ingesting cyanide @-@ laden Tylenol capsules . The New York Times wrote a front @-@ page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October , and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that . More than 100 law enforcement agents , and 1 @,@ 100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case . Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $ 100 million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles . In October 1982 , 634 people were reported having AIDS , and of those , 260 had died . The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS , none on the front page . The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product @-@ tampering ; Legionnaire 's Disease was a public health emergency . Twenty @-@ nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia . The National Institute of Health spent $ 34 @,@ 841 per death of Legionnaire 's Disease . In contrast , the NIH spent $ 3 @,@ 225 in 1981 and about $ 8 @,@ 991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS . 
 Shilts accused Ronald Reagan of neglecting to address AIDS to the American people until 1987 — calling his behavior " ritualistic silence " — even after Reagan called friend Rock Hudson to tell him to get well . After Hudson 's death and in the face of increasing public anxiety , Reagan directed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to provide a report on the epidemic . Though Koop was a political conservative , his report was nevertheless clear about what causes AIDS and what people and the U.S. government should do to stop it , including sex and AIDS education provided for all people . 
 On a civic level , the closure of gay bathhouses in San Francisco became a bitter political fight in the gay community . Activists put pressure on the San Francisco Public Health director to educate people about how AIDS is transmitted , and demanded he close bathhouses as a matter of public health . 
 = = = News media = = = 
 Shilts was assigned to AIDS full @-@ time at The San Francisco Chronicle in 1982 . It was from this unique vantage point that he repeatedly criticized the U.S. news media for ignoring the medical crisis because it did not affect people who mattered , only gays and drug addicts . Shilts noted most newspapers would print stories about AIDS only when it affected heterosexuals , sometimes taking particular interest in stories about AIDS in prostitutes . AIDS was not reported in the Wall Street Journal until it involved heterosexuals . Many stories called AIDS a " gay plague " or " homosexual disease " in articles that pointed to it showing up in new populations , like hemophiliacs or people who had received blood transfusions . Shilts recounted the irony of a reporter commenting on how little was reported about the disease , then linking it once more to rarer instances of transmission to non @-@ drug @-@ using heterosexuals . On the other end of the extreme , a general phobia of AIDS was exacerbated by the news media who erroneously reported that AIDS could be contracted by household contact , without checking any facts in their stories , which prompted mass hysteria across the United States . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The book became a commercial success , contrary to Shilts ' own expectations . It remained on the New York Times Bestseller List for five weeks , was translated into seven languages , nominated for a National Book Award , and made Shilts an " AIDS celebrity " . In Rolling Stone , Shilts is compared to great American writers whose careers were made by the circumstances surrounding them , such as Thomas Paine in the American Revolution , Edward R. Murrow during the Blitz , and David Halberstam during the Vietnam War . Writer Jon Katz explains , " No other mainstream journalist has sounded the alarm so frantically , caught the dimensions of the AIDS tragedy so poignantly or focused so much attention on government delay , the <unk> of research funding and institutional intrigue " . In the American Journal of Public Health , Howard Merkel characterizes And the Band Played On as the first volume of the historiography of AIDS . Because the content expanded into law and science , reviews were published not only in literary sources but legal and medical journals as well . 
 = = = Literary = = = 
 Literary reviews of the work were generally positive , with reviewers commenting on the hypnotic and thriller @-@ like qualities of the book . Shilts ' investigative and journalistic endeavors were praised , and reviewers seemed genuinely moved by the personal stories of the major players . And the Band Played On won the Stonewall Book Award for 1988 . It earned the 10th spot on " 100 Lesbian and Gay Books That Changed Our Lives " , compiled by the Lambda Book Report . In 1999 , The New York City Public Library topped its list of " 21 New Classics for the 21st Century " with And the Band Played On . Two years after it was published however , Shilts remained " fundamentally disappointed " when a radical response to the AIDS crisis did not materialize , despite the reaction to his book . 
 In a 1988 book review , Jack Geiger of The New York Times commented that the detail in Shilts ' work was too confusing , being told " in five simultaneous but disjointed chronologies , making them all less coherent " , and notes that Shilts neglected to dedicate as much detail to black and Hispanic intravenous drug users , their partners and their children as to gay men . Geiger also expressed doubts that a swifter response by the government would have stemmed the spread of AIDS as quickly as Shilts was implying . Woodrow Myers from the Los Angeles Times was frustrated by Shilts not asking the right questions : " Shilts fails to probe the broader questions and stops where far too many of us stop : We don 't ask why the Department of Defense and the entitlements like Social Security are getting all the money when the homosexuals and the IV drug abusers with AIDS and the multiple sclerosis patients are not . " The Gay Community News in Boston also criticized the book 's implications that a diagnosis of HIV indicated that death was sure and imminent . Richard <unk> , editor of The Advocate in 1992 criticized Shilts for being out of touch with the contemporary style of activism and its sexual overtones . 
 = = = Science and law = = = 
 Shilts ' book has been used as a standard by the lay press when reviewing books chronicling subsequent medical crises including breast cancer , chronic fatigue syndrome , Agent Orange , and continued response to AIDS . However , the academic and scientific communities have been somewhat more critical . Howard Merkel , in the American Journal of Public Health , notes Shilts ' tendency to assign blame , writing " A requirement of the journalist , and certainly the historian , however , is to explain human society rather than to point fingers " . Jon Katz in Rolling Stone refutes this by stating " [ Shilts ] fused strong belief with the gathering of factual information and the marshaling of arguments , the way the founders of the modern press did . In doing so , he has exposed the notion of objectivity as bankrupt , ineffective , even lethal " . 
 Although Sandra Panem in the journal Science praised Shilts ' efforts and the attention the book brought to AIDS , she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight to the issue of homophobia hampering attention on the disease , but remarks that even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people , similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress . 
 Wendy Parmet , a professor at Northeastern University Law School , highlights the greatest strengths of And the Band Played On to be " the pain and courage of individual confronted with AIDS " and how it " eloquently portrays the human side of the crisis " and believes the blame others criticized to be justified ; but Parmet considers his technique of assigning an omniscient point of view a weakness , suggesting that it blurs the lines between fact and fiction . In Contemporary Sociology , Peter Manning and Terry Stein also call Shilts ' narrative method into question , and ask why , for a syndrome that affects people beyond race , class , and sexual orientation , that Shilts focuses so narrowly on AIDS as it is related to homosexuality . The writers , however , were mostly impressed with the book , calling it an " informative , often brilliant , overview of the emergent meanings of the AIDS epidemic " . 
 Shilts is often quoted as claiming that Ronald Reagan neglected to mention AIDS publicly until 1987 . However , Reagan briefly mentioned AIDS research in questions and answers during a news conference on September 17 , 1985 . 
 = = = Gaëtan Dugas as " Patient Zero " = = = 
 The book includes extensive discussion of Gaëtan Dugas , a Canadian flight attendant who died in 1984 . Dugas was labeled Patient Zero of AIDS , because he was linked directly or indirectly with 40 of the first 248 reported cases of AIDS in the U.S. , and after he was told of his ability to infect others , defiantly continued to have unprotected sex . Many book reviews concentrated their material on Dugas , or led their assessment of the book with discussion of his behavior . Some reviewers interpreted Shilts ' naming Dugas " Patient Zero " to mean that Dugas brought AIDS to North America ; the National Review called Dugas the " Columbus of AIDS " and in their review of And the Band Played On states , " [ Dugas ] picked up the disease in Europe through sexual contact with Africans . Traveling on his airline @-@ employee privileges , he spread it here from coast to coast . " Shilts never stated this in the book , instead writing , " Whether Gaëtan Dugas actually was the person who brought AIDS to North America remains a question of debate and is ultimately unanswerable ... there 's no doubt that Gaëtan played a key role in spreading the new virus from one end of the United States to the other . " Time titled its review of And the Band Played On " The Appalling Saga of Patient Zero " , erroneously restating the claim that Dugas had brought AIDS to the continent . Even a press release by St. Martin 's Press made the connection between Dugas and the introduction of AIDS to the Western World in its title , but not its text . 
 When the book was released , Dugas ' story became a controversial subject in the Canadian media . Shilts claimed that " the Canadian press went crazy over the story " and that " Canadians ... saw it as an offense to their nationhood . " The original study identifying Dugas as the index case had been completed by William Darrow , but it was called into question by University of California San Francisco epidemiologist Andrew Moss . Moss wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Review of Books , " There is very little evidence that <unk> was ' patient zero ' for the US or for California , " while also stating that Shilts did not <unk> Dugas ' lack of personal responsibility . Sandra Panem in Science uses Shilts ' approach toward Dugas ' behavior as an example of his " glib " treatment of the science involved in the epidemic . Author Douglas Crimp suggests that Shilts ' representation of Dugas as " murderously irresponsible " is in actuality " Shilts ' homophobic nightmare of himself " , and that Dugas is offered as a " scapegoat for his heterosexual colleagues , in order to prove that [ Shilts ] , like them , is horrified by such creatures . " Many years later , in the 2000s , it was shown , by tracing the roots of the virus , that it had spread from Africa to Haiti , and then to the U.S. in the mid 1960s , before Dugas would have been very sexually active , if at all , and before he was working as a flight attendant .

 While Shilts was writing the book he was tested for HIV but insisted his doctor not tell him the results until the book was finished so it would not affect his journalistic integrity . On the day he sent the final manuscript to the publisher , he learned he was HIV @-@ positive . He also revealed that he received abuse from gays for the articles he wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle supporting the bathhouse closures , as well as for And the Band Played On , saying it was common for him to be spat upon in the Castro District . He was openly booed when he attended the premiere of The Times of Harvey Milk — based on his book The Mayor of Castro Street — at the Castro Theatre . Footage he had shot as a television reporter was included in the film , but during the construction of the documentary he was so controversial that the film 's editors removed him from footage showing him with Milk . Following the publication of And the Band Played On , however , he was " worshiped " by many in the gay community for writing the book , but also seen as someone who pandered to publicity . 
 Shilts declared while promoting the book in Australia in 1988 that AIDS in the western world could be eradicated , and by 1994 , " AIDS could be as manageable as diabetes " . However , in reference to Africa , Shilts noted , " At this point it 's inconceivable that there will be an AIDS @-@ free world in Central Africa , as we 're looking at a death rate on the scale of the Holocaust . " Shilts gave an interview in 1991 where he noticed , " the stellar AIDS reporters in the early years ... the people who did the best job — and the reporters who wanted to cover AIDS but their male editors wouldn 't let them — tended to be women " , and made a connection that if more women were allowed to write about the epidemic , media coverage would have been vastly different . 
 Randy Shilts died from complications of AIDS in 1994 . Upon his death he was eulogized by Cleve Jones , who said " Randy 's contribution was so crucial . He broke through society 's denial and was absolutely critical to communicating the reality of AIDS . " Larry Kramer said of him , " He single @-@ handedly probably did more to educate the world about AIDS than any single person . "

 And the Band Played On was used as the basis for a 1993 Emmy @-@ winning HBO movie of the same name . It was produced by Aaron Spelling , directed by Roger Spottiswoode , and starred Matthew Modine as epidemiologist Don Francis and Richard Masur as Dr. William Darrow at the Centers for Disease Control . Alan Alda portrayed controversial viral researcher Robert Gallo , and many other stars appeared in supporting and cameo roles , who agreed to appear in the film for union @-@ scale pay . The film was released the same year as Philadelphia and Angels in America , which prompted one reviewer to note it a triumph and a loss : 12 years after the epidemic had begun , such works of art were necessary still to draw attention to it . Reviews of the film were mixed , claiming that it was a noble try , but failed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the intricacies of the response to AIDS .

 = Mewtwo = 
 Mewtwo ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> ) is a fictional creature from Nintendo and Game Freak 's Pokémon media franchise . Created by Ken Sugimori , it first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and their sequels , and later appeared in various merchandise , spinoff titles , as well as animation adaptations of the franchise . Masachika Ichimura voiced the franchise 's original Mewtwo character in Japanese , and the creature 's younger self is voiced by Fujiko Takimoto in the Sound Picture Box : Mewtwo 's Origin CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo in the anime adaptation . In English , Jay <unk> voiced Mewtwo in Mewtwo Strikes Back and the Pokémon Live ! musical . For the former production , he was credited under the pseudonym " Philip Bartlett " . Dan Green provided the voice in Mewtwo Returns . Actress Reiko Takashima voices a separate Mewtwo character in the prequel special Mewtwo : Prologue to Awakening and the film <unk> Genesect : Mewtwo Awakens ; this second Mewtwo is voiced by actress Miriam <unk> in the English dub . 
 In the video games , the player can fight and capture Mewtwo to pit it against other Pokémon . The player first learns of Mewtwo late in Pokémon Red and Blue by reading research documents left in a ruined laboratory on Cinnabar Island . The documents reveal that a solitary scientist spent years genetically engineering a descendant of the Pokémon Mew . Mewtwo eventually escaped after proving too strong to contain . 
 Regarded as one of the series ' strongest Pokémon , it changed the way players approached the games by forcing them to find ways to counteract those using Mewtwo . Studies found the character popular with older male children , which contrasted with its counterpart Mew . Reactions to the creature 's first anime portrayal have been divided , as reviewers such as Daily Record cited it as a cliché villain , while others such as Animerica and Sight & Sound praised the character 's depth . 
 = = Design and characteristics = = 
 Japanese video game designer Ken Sugimori designed Mewtwo for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games , Red and Green , known outside Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue . Its name , which means the " second of Mew " , derives from its existence as a genetic duplicate of the original Mew . Until the first Pokémon movie was released in the United States , Mewtwo was rarely referred to as a " clone " in Japanese sources . Kubo Masakazu , executive producer of Mewtwo Strikes Back , explained that they " intentionally avoid using the term ' <unk> ' [ clone ] … because the word has a frightening feel " . Despite being Mew 's descendant , Mewtwo directly precedes Mew in the game 's numerical Pokémon index owing to the latter 's secret inclusion by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto . During an interview , Pokémon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara stated that Mewtwo was expected to be popular with North American audiences , citing their preference for strong , powerful characters . 
 Its build is very different compared to Mew 's , appearing as a large bipedal feline , with a white body , pronounced purple tail and stomach , feline head , and a mass of flesh connecting the center of its back to its head behind its neck . Its appearance has been likened to " an oversized cross of cat , squirrel and kangaroo " . In the original games , Mewtwo is intended to be " the strongest Pokémon ever " . It is psychic , uses telekinesis for flight and telepathy to speak . When fighting , it uses its abilities to shield itself or throw opponents to compensate for its lack of speed . Otherwise , it conserves its energy until needed . It can regenerate as well , and is able to quickly recover from near @-@ fatal injuries . Mewtwo stands 6 feet 7 inches ( 201 cm ) tall . 
 As a character in the games , Mewtwo seldom has spoken dialogue , but when it does it is presented as vicious and primarily interested in proving its own strength . The franchise 's non @-@ video game media , particularly the anime , has expanded upon the character , giving Mewtwo a male voice and , while aware of why it was created , actively questioning its own existence .

 In Pokémon Red and Blue , the player learns of Mewtwo 's existence by reading research notes left in the ruined " Pokémon Mansion " on Cinnabar Island . The notes say that the island 's scientists discovered a new Pokémon in a Guyana jungle , that they christened it Mew , and that it later gave birth to a creature they called Mewtwo ; the game 's Pokédex entry states that Mewtwo was " created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments " . Mewtwo proved too mighty to control , destroying the laboratory and escaping . The player is later given an opportunity to capture Mewtwo in the Cerulean Cave ( called the ' Unknown Dungeon ' in the original games ) , which is accessible only after defeating the game 's final bosses , the Elite Four and Blue ; in the remake titles Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen this prerequisite was expanded , requiring the player to explore more thoroughly and record information on sixty Pokémon species before access to the cave would be granted . Mewtwo is catchable in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver in the same location as before after defeating all of the gym leaders in Kanto . The character was the focus of a promotion and downloadable content giveaway for Pokémon Black and White . Mewtwo appears in Pokémon X and Y after completing the main story and is one of several Pokémon that is able to use the new Mega Evolution mechanic , becoming either Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y. 
 Since its debut , Mewtwo has appeared in other Nintendo games . In Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Pinball , Mewtwo appears as a final boss after all competitions have been completed . In Pokémon Puzzle League , Mewtwo serves not only as the final opponent , but also as the main antagonist responsible for the game 's events . Other games , such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series have featured Mewtwo as an unlockable player character that must be defeated before it may be used , while games such as Pokémon Snap have featured the character in cameos , appearing once certain conditions have been met . For all appearances in which the character has spoken dialogue , Mewtwo is voiced by Masachika Ichimura , with the exception of Pokémon Puzzle League , where it is voiced by Philip Bartlett . After failing to make a playable appearance in Super Smash Bros. Brawl , Mewtwo became available as a DLC character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U on April 28 , 2015 , though it was made available to Club Nintendo members who registered both versions on April 15 , 2015 . In 3DS / Wii U , its Final Smash involves becoming Mega Mewtwo Y and using <unk> . A new form of Mewtwo , Shadow Mewtwo , appears as a boss character in Pokkén Tournament , becoming Mega Mewtwo X as its special attack . The traditional Mewtwo appears as a playable character in the Wii U version as well .

 Mewtwo is featured in the 1998 animated film Pokémon : The First Movie as the main antagonist , in which it is shown to be the creation of the criminal organization Team Rocket . After Mewtwo destroys the laboratory where it was born , Team Rocket 's leader , Giovanni , convinces it he can help it control its powers . He instead uses Mewtwo as a weapon . After escaping Giovanni , Mewtwo questions its reason for existence and declares revenge on its creators . To this end , it lures several Pokémon trainers , among them movie protagonist Ash Ketchum , to its island in order to clone their Pokémon . Once it does so , Mewtwo forces the originals to battle the clones in an effort to determine which set is superior , while Mewtwo faces its own original , Mew . Ash sacrifices himself to stop the fighting , though he is later revived . Mewtwo , Mew , and the clones then leave to find a sanctuary , striking memory of the events from those gathered . In localizing the film for English @-@ language audiences , Mewtwo 's personality became more arrogant and megalomaniacal ; localization director Norman <unk> ruled the changes necessary , as he believed American audiences needed a " clearly evil " rather than ambiguous villain . In the film , Mewtwo is voiced by Philip Bartlett in English , and by Ichimura in Japanese . In this film , Mewtwo displayed unique abilities and powers unseen in other Pokémon , such as blocking all Pokémon moves in his arena when the clones face off against the originals . 
 In September 1999 , Nintendo published Sound Picture Box Mewtwo , which included The Birth of Mewtwo : Pokémon Radio Drama , a CD drama that expands upon Mewtwo 's origins . Created by scientist Dr. Fuji , Mewtwo is one of several cloning attempts , which also include a clone of Fuji 's deceased daughter . The young Mewtwo befriends her , communicating telepathically ; however the cloning process proves unstable , and she dies . To save the traumatized Mewtwo , Fuji erases its memories and puts it under sedation until its body finishes developing , leading to the events of the film . The CD drama was later adapted into a short anime , and was included with Japanese home releases and broadcasts of Mewtwo Strikes Back and later in North America in December 2001 as part of Mewtwo Returns . Mewtwo as a child is voiced in Japanese by Fujiko Takimoto for the CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo for the anime , while in the English localization the voice actor is uncredited . 
 In December 2000 , the film was followed by a sequel , Pokémon : Mewtwo Returns , which was broadcast on Japanese television in December 2000 and released worldwide on home video and DVD in 2001 . Voiced by Dan Green in English with Ichimura reprising the role in Japanese , Mewtwo and the clones have since found peace in another region . However , Giovanni , whose memories were left intact after the first film , locates and pursues Mewtwo . Assisted by Ash and his companions , Mewtwo comes to terms with its existence and defeats Giovanni , removing any memory of itself from his and his soldiers ' minds , while leaving the others unaffected . As everyone departs , Mewtwo sets out on its own . 
 Mewtwo also appears in the musical Pokémon Live ! , a live action adaptation of the anime set after Pokémon : The First Movie , and is portrayed by Marton <unk> . In it , Mewtwo faces a robotic replica of itself , <unk> , created by Giovanni and able to learn any attacks used against it . However , after learning compassion from Mewtwo , the machine rebels and self @-@ destructs . The 2006 television special Pokémon : The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon features a hologram version of Mewtwo , created and controlled by the story 's antagonist Dr. Yung . With help from a hologram Mew , Ash and his companions destroy the Mewtwo hologram and defeat Yung . 
 Another Mewtwo appears in the anime special Mewtwo : Prologue to Awakening and the film Genesect and the Legend Awakened , voiced by the actress Reiko Takashima , to protect Ash , Iris , <unk> , and Eric from the rampaging Genesect army . This Mewtwo is able to Mega Evolve into Mega Mewtwo Y , referred to in the film as Mewtwo 's " Awakened Form " ( <unk> , Kakusei @-@ shita <unk> ) . 
 A Mewtwo , which was created by Mr. Fuji , appears in the anime miniseries Pokémon Origins , which is generally based on the plot of the video games Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen . As such , Red goes to Cerulean Cave , and uses the Mega Evolution mechanic introduced in Pokémon X and Y to Mega Evolve his Charizard for the fight with Mewtwo , whom Red captures .

 Mewtwo has appeared as a central character in several books related to the Pokémon franchise , including novelizations of Mewtwo Strikes Back and Mewtwo Returns , both of which closely follow the events of the films . In December 1999 , Viz Media published the children 's picture book I 'm Not Pikachu ! : Pokémon Tales Movie Special , which featured children taking on traits of the characters from the film , including Mewtwo . In May 2001 , Viz released a second children 's book , Mewtwo 's Watching You ! , which featured a shy Mewtwo <unk> watching other Pokémon play . 
 In the manga series Pokémon Adventures , Team Rocket creates Mewtwo , but some of his DNA is placed inside of the Gym leader Blaine . Because of the DNA that they share , the two are unable to be separated for very long without becoming ill . Later , another Pokémon , Entei is able to break the bond between the two by removing the DNA in Blaine 's arm , at which point Mewtwo leaves . It eventually helps the main character of the series , Red , fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys . 
 In 1998 , Toshihiro Ono was asked to write a story detailing Mewtwo 's origin to coincide with the release of Mewtwo Strikes Back . The 52 @-@ page comic , presented in the form of a flashback , was replaced midway by the " The Birth of Mewtwo " animated short , resulting in little connection between Ono 's work and the film . Regardless , it saw print as a side story for Pokémon : The Electric Tale of Pikachu in the July 1998 issue of CoroCoro Comic . In it , Mewtwo 's creator Dr. Fuji takes on the role of a coach for the fully developed Pokémon , while his employer , Team Rocket , tests its abilities . Learning of a plan to mass @-@ produce it as a weapon , Fuji approaches Mewtwo and tells it to destroy the lab and Fuji himself . Mewtwo refuses , stating it cannot harm the doctor , who it regards as its father . Once captured by Team Rocket , Fuji tells Mewtwo that he is honored by the statement , and is then killed . Angered by his death , Mewtwo destroys the lab and escapes . In the present , Mewtwo cries in its sleep as it dreams of the events . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 In the games , Mewtwo is consistently noted as being one of the strongest opponents , and has been described in Pokémon Red and Blue as being " the best Pokémon in the game " , as well as " one of the rarest — and hardest to catch " . Because of the character 's multiple strengths and few weaknesses , it changed how players approached playing against each other , causing players to either develop strategies solely to defeat an opposing Mewtwo , or prohibit its use when battling other players . IGN 's staff bemoaned its exclusion from Super Smash Bros. Brawl . A poll by IGN on whether the character was missed by others in Brawl shared a similar sentiment , though they also described it as one of Super Smash Bros. Melee 's weakest characters . Professional Super Smash Bros. player Jason " <unk> " Zimmerman takes his handle from Mewtwo , although he uses other characters in competition . Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Mewtwo the fifth best Legendary Pokémon and the sixth best Pokémon overall . 
 The book Pikachu 's Global Adventure : The Rise and Fall of Pokémon noted Mewtwo as popular with older male children who tend to be drawn to " tough or scary " characters ; Mew in contrast was described as a polar opposite , a character popular with young girls who tend to be drawn to " cute " characters . Others books , such as Media and the Make @-@ believe Worlds of Children , have noted a similar comparison , citing Mewtwo as " more aggressive @-@ looking " compared to Mew and emphasizing the importance of the contrast for children . The book Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia @-@ Pacific compares Sugimori 's design of Mewtwo to that of Japanese tokusatsu films , namely monster films like the 1954 Godzilla in creating " monstrous yet familiar silhouettes from the past renewed agency in the form of eyes and expressions which cut through the viewer " . 
 In reception to extended media for the Pokémon franchise , Mewtwo has been likened to Frankenstein 's monster as a being born from artificial means and discontent with the fact . Theology Secretary for the Church of England Anne Richards described Mewtwo as representing a " parable about the pointlessness of force " , and praised the character for displaying the Christian value of redemption . Other reactions have been mixed . While it has been cited as a " complex and compelling villain " by some critics , its goal of world domination was received as a trait shared by " … every anime villain … " , and likened to a James Bond villain by Daily Record . However , Animerica praised Mewtwo as a character with " philosophical depth " as well as for serving as " an adversary of almost infinite power and genuine malice " that the anime series had been lacking . Ken Hollings of Sight & Sound described Mewtwo as " brooding , articulate and vengeful where the other Pokémon remain bright blobs of wordless energy " , and " Like a troubled elder brother , Mewtwo represents an older order of experience . " Anime Classics <unk> ! : 100 Must @-@ See Japanese Animation Masterpieces praised the character as the best villain of the Pokémon film series , and one of Mewtwo Strikes Back 's strongest elements . The Los Angeles Times cited its behavior as a point of humor in relation to its appearance as a " decidedly feline character . " 
 Mewtwo 's image is utilized for merchandise related to the Pokémon franchise , which includes toys , children 's toothbrushes , and a playing piece for a Pokémon @-@ themed version of Monopoly . Several action figures have been made , such as a posable figure by Hasbro in 2006 that included accessories to recreate its " Hyper Beam " and " Light Screen " attacks , and a six @-@ inch @-@ tall " talking " figurine by Jakks Pacific as part of a series to commemorate the anime 's Battle Frontier story arc .

 = Cosima Wagner = 
 Cosima Wagner ( born Francesca <unk> Cosima Liszt ; 24 December 1837 – 1 April 1930 ) was the illegitimate daughter of the Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt and Marie d 'Agoult . She became the second wife of the German composer Richard Wagner , and with him founded the Bayreuth Festival as a showcase for his stage works ; after his death she devoted the rest of her life to the promotion of his music and philosophy . Commentators have recognised Cosima as the principal inspiration for Wagner 's later works , particularly Parsifal . 
 In 1857 , after a childhood largely spent under the care of her grandmother and with governesses , Cosima married the conductor Hans von Bülow . Although the marriage produced two children , it was largely a loveless union , and in 1863 Cosima began a relationship with Wagner , who was 24 years her senior . She married him in 1870 ; after his death in 1883 she directed the Bayreuth Festival for more than 20 years , increasing its repertoire to form the Bayreuth canon of ten operas and establishing the festival as a major event in the world of musical theatre . 
 During her directorship , Cosima opposed theatrical innovations and adhered closely to Wagner 's original productions of his works , an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907 . She shared Wagner 's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority , and under her influence , Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism . This was a defining feature of Bayreuth for decades , into the Nazi era which closely followed her death in 1930 . Thus , although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival , her legacy remains controversial . 
 = = Family background and early childhood = = 
 In January 1833 the 21 @-@ year @-@ old Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt met Marie d 'Agoult , a Parisian socialite six years his senior . Marie 's antecedents were mixed ; her German mother , from a prominent Frankfurt banking family , had married a French nobleman , the Comte de Flavigny . Marie had been married since 1827 to Charles , Comte d 'Agoult , and had borne him two daughters , but the union had become sterile . Drawn together by their mutual intellectual interests , Marie and Liszt embarked on a passionate relationship . In March 1835 the couple fled Paris for Switzerland ; ignoring the scandal they left in their wake , they settled in Geneva where , on 18 December , Marie gave birth to a daughter , Blandine @-@ Rachel . 
 In the following two years Liszt and Marie travelled widely in pursuit of his career as a concert pianist . Late in 1837 , when Marie was heavily pregnant with their second child , the couple were at Como in Italy . Here , on 24 December in a lakeside hotel in Bellagio , a second daughter was born . They named her Francesca <unk> Cosima , the unusual third name being derived from St Cosmas , a patron saint of physicians and apothecaries ; it was as " Cosima " that the child became known . With her sister she was left in the care of wet nurses ( a common practice at the time ) , while Liszt and Marie continued to travel in Europe . Their third child and only son , Daniel , was born on 9 May 1839 in Venice . 
 In 1839 , while Liszt continued his travels , Marie took the social risk of returning to Paris with her daughters . Her hopes of recovering her status in the city were dented when her influential mother , Madame de Flavigny , refused to acknowledge the children ; Marie would not be accepted socially while her daughters were clearly in evidence . Liszt 's solution was to remove the girls from Marie and place them with his mother , Anna Liszt , in her Paris home while Daniel remained with nurses in Venice . By this means , both Marie and Liszt could continue their independent lives . Relations between the couple cooled , and by 1841 they were seeing little of each other ; it is likely that both engaged in other affairs . By 1845 the breach between them was such that they were communicating only through third parties . Liszt forbade contact between mother and daughters ; Marie accused him of attempting to steal " the fruits of a mother 's womb " , while Liszt insisted on his sole right to decide the children 's future . Marie threatened to fight him " like a lioness " , but soon gave up the struggle , perhaps valuing the preservation of her social status above her duties as a mother . Though they were living in the same city , she did not see either of her daughters for five years , until 1850 . 
 = = Schooling and adolescence = = 
 Cosima and Blandine remained with Anna Liszt until 1850 , joined eventually by Daniel . Cosima 's biographer George Marek describes Anna as " a simple , uneducated , unworldly but warmhearted woman ... for the first time [ the girls ] experienced what it was to be touched by love " . Of the sisters , Blandine was evidently the prettier ; Cosima , with her long nose and wide mouth was described as an " ugly duckling " . Although Liszt 's relations with his children were formal and distant , he provided for them liberally , and ensured that they were well educated . Both girls were sent to Madame Bernard 's , an exclusive boarding school , while Daniel was prepared for the prestigious Lycée Bonaparte . 
 In 1847 Liszt met Princess Carolyne zu Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein , the estranged wife of a Russian prince . By the autumn of 1848 she and Liszt had become lovers , and their relationship lasted for the remainder of his life . She quickly assumed responsibility for the management of Liszt 's life , including the upbringing of his daughters . Early in 1850 Liszt had been disturbed to learn that Blandine and Cosima were seeing their mother again ; his response , guided by the princess , was to remove them from their school and place them into the full @-@ time care of Carolyne 's old governess , the 72 @-@ year @-@ old Madame Patersi de <unk> . Liszt 's instructions were clear — Madame Patersi was to control every aspect of the girls ' lives : " She alone is to decide what is to be permitted them and what forbidden " . 
 Blandine and Cosima were subjected to the Patersi curriculum for four years . Cosima 's biographer Olive Hilmes likens the regime to that used for breaking in horses , though Marek describes it as exacting but ultimately beneficial to Cosima : " Above all , Patersi taught her how a ' noble lady ' must behave , how to alight from a carriage , how to enter a drawing room , how to greet a duchess as against a commoner ... and how not to betray herself when she was hurt " . On 10 October 1853 Liszt arrived at the Patersi apartment , his first visit to his daughters since 1845 . With him were two fellow @-@ composers : Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner . Carolyne 's daughter Marie , who was present , described Cosima 's appearance as " in the worst phase of adolescence , tall and angular , sallow ... the image of her father . Only her long golden hair , of unusual sheen , was beautiful " . After a family meal , Wagner read to the group from his text for the final act of what was to become Götterdämmerung . Cosima seems to have made little impression on him ; in his memoirs he merely recorded that both girls were very shy .

 As his daughters approached womanhood , Liszt felt that a change in their lives was called for and in 1855 he arranged ( over their mother 's bitter protests ) for them to move to Berlin . Here they were placed in the care of Franziska von Bülow , whose son Hans was Liszt 's most outstanding pupil ; he would take charge of the girls ' musical education while Frau von Bülow supervised their general and moral welfare . Hans von Bülow , born in 1830 , had abandoned his legal education after hearing Liszt conduct the premiere of Wagner 's Lohengrin at Weimar in August 1850 , and had decided to dedicate his life to music . After a brief spell conducting in small opera houses , Bülow studied with Liszt , who was convinced that he would become a great concert pianist . Bülow was quickly impressed by Cosima 's own skill as a pianist , in which he saw the stamp of her father , and the pair developed romantic feelings for each other . Liszt approved the match , and the marriage took place at St. Hedwig 's Cathedral , Berlin , on 18 August 1857 . During their honeymoon , along with Liszt they visited Wagner at his home near Zurich . This visit was repeated the following year , when Cosima , on taking her leave , shocked Wagner with an emotional demonstration : " [ S ] he fell at my feet , covered my hands with tears and kisses ... I pondered the mystery , without being able to solve it " . 
 Cosima , a Parisian by upbringing , found it hard to adjust to life in Berlin , which was then a more provincial city than Paris . Her attempts to mix with local society , according to Marie zu Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein , were handicapped by " [ h ] er exaggerated self @-@ esteem and innate <unk> " , which alienated the men and women in her circle . At least initially , Cosima took an interest in her husband 's career , encouraging him to extend his activities into composition . On one occasion she provided him with a scenario she had written for an opera based on the story of Merlin , court magician to King Arthur . However , nothing came of this project . Bülow 's crowded professional schedule left Cosima alone for long periods , during which she worked for the French @-@ language magazine Revue <unk> as a translator and contributor . In December 1859 she was saddened by the death of her brother Daniel , at the age of twenty , after a long wasting illness . Cosima 's first child , a daughter born on 12 October 1860 , was named Daniela in Daniel 's memory . A further , unexpected blow for Cosima fell in September 1862 , when her sister Blandine , who had shared much of her upbringing , died in childbirth — she had been married to Émile Ollivier , a Parisian lawyer , since October 1857 . Cosima 's second daughter , born in March 1863 , was named Blandina Elisabeth Veronica . 
 Bülow was committed to Wagner 's music ; in 1858 he had undertaken the preparation of a vocal score for Tristan und Isolde , and by 1862 he was making a fair copy of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg . A social relationship developed , and during the summer of 1862 the Bülows stayed with Wagner at the composer 's home at Biebrich . Wagner records that Cosima became " transfigured " by his rendering of " Wotan 's Farewell " from Die Walküre . In October 1862 , just after Blandine 's death , Wagner and Bülow shared conducting duties at a concert in Leipzig ; Wagner records that , during a rehearsal , " I felt utterly transported by the sight of Cosima ... she appeared to me as if stepping from another world " . In these years Wagner 's emotional life was in disarray . He was still married to his first wife , Minna Planer ( she was to die in 1866 ) , and was involved in several extramarital relationships . On 28 November 1863 Wagner visited Berlin ; while Bülow was rehearsing a concert , Wagner and Cosima took a long cab ride through Berlin and declared their feelings for each other : " with tears and sobs " , Wagner later wrote , " we sealed our confession to belong to each other alone " .

 In 1864 Wagner 's financial position was transformed by his new patron , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old King Ludwig II of Bavaria , who paid off the composer 's debts and awarded him a generous annual stipend . Ludwig also provided Wagner with a lakeside retreat at Lake Starnberg , and a grand house in Munich . At Wagner 's instigation , von Bülow accepted a post as Ludwig 's " royal pianist " ; he and Cosima moved to Munich , and took a house conveniently close to Wagner 's , ostensibly so that Cosima could work as the composer 's secretary . From 29 June 1864 Cosima spent more than a week alone with Wagner at Lake Starnberg , before von Bülow joined them on 7 July . According to Wagner 's housekeeper , Anna Mrazek , " it was easy to tell that something was going on between Frau Cosima and Richard Wagner " . Mrazek said that later in the visit von Bülow found his wife in Wagner 's bedroom , but nevertheless made no demands for an explanation , either from Wagner or from his wife . Nine months after this visit , on 10 April 1865 , Cosima gave birth to a daughter , Isolde . Such was von Bülow 's devotion to Wagner that he accepted the child as his own , and registered her as " the legitimate daughter " of Hans and Cosima von Bülow . Wagner attended the Catholic baptism on 24 April . On 10 June 1865 , at the Munich Hofoper , von Bülow conducted the premiere of Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde . 
 Wagner 's role at Ludwig 's court became controversial ; in particular , Ludwig 's habit of referring Wagner 's policy ideas to his ministers alarmed the court . When Wagner demanded the sacking both of Ludwig 's cabinet secretary and of his prime minister , there was a public outcry , and in December 1865 Ludwig reluctantly told Wagner to leave Bavaria . The king did not , however , withdraw his patronage or financial support . After a few months ' wandering , in March 1866 Wagner arrived in Geneva , where Cosima joined him . They travelled together to Lucerne where they found a large lakeside house , the Villa Tribschen . Wagner made immediate arrangements to rent the house , at the king 's expense , and by 15 April was installed in his new home . 
 Immediately upon signing the lease , Wagner invited the von Bülows and their children to stay with him . They spent the summer there , returning briefly to Munich before von Bülow left for Basel while Cosima went back to Tribschen . By now von Bülow understood his wife 's relationship with Wagner ; he wrote to a friend that " since February 1865 I was in absolutely no doubt about the extremely peculiar nature of the situation " . Wagner , anxious to avoid associating Cosima in a public scandal , deceived Ludwig into issuing a statement in June 1866 which declared the unbroken sanctity of the von Bülows ' marriage , and promised retribution for those daring to suggest otherwise . By this time Cosima was pregnant with her second child by Wagner ; a daughter , Eva , was born at Tribschen on 17 February 1867 . Through all this , von Bülow retained his devotion to Wagner 's music . He had been appointed music director of the Munich Hofoper , and threw himself into the preparations for the premiere of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg . This took place on 21 June 1868 under his baton , and was a great success . Shortly afterwards , Cosima rejoined Wagner at Tribschen ; Wagner explained to the king that she could not bear the insults to which she was continually subjected in Munich , and wished to escape from the world . 
 In October 1868 Cosima asked her husband for a divorce , to which he would not initially agree . To sceptical enquirers he explained her absence from the von Bülow family home by a supposed visit to her half @-@ sister in Versailles . In June 1869 , immediately after the birth of her and Wagner 's third and final child , Siegfried , Cosima wrote to von Bülow in what she called a " final attempt at an understanding " . His reply was conciliatory ; he wrote : " You have preferred to consecrate the treasures of your heart and mind to a higher being : far from censuring you for this step , I approve of it " . Legal processes extended the marriage until 18 July 1870 , when the divorce was finally sanctioned by a Berlin court . After the divorce von Bülow distanced himself from both Wagner and Cosima ; he never again spoke to Wagner , and 11 years passed before his next meeting with Cosima . 
 Wagner and Cosima were married at Lucerne , on 25 August 1870 , in a Protestant church . Cosima 's journal for that day records : " May I be worthy of bearing R 's name ! " Liszt was not informed in advance of the wedding , and learned of it first through the newspapers . The year ended on a high note for the Wagners : on 25 December , the day on which Cosima always celebrated her birthday although she had been born on the 24th , she awoke to the sounds of music . She commemorated the event in her journal : " ... music was sounding , and what music ! After it had died away , R ... put into my hands the score of his " Symphonic Birthday Greeting . ... R had set up his orchestra on the stairs , and thus consecrated our Tribschen forever ! " This was the first performance of the music that became known as the Siegfried Idyll .

 Wagner 's deception over his relationship with Cosima had seriously damaged his standing with Ludwig . Matters were worsened by Ludwig 's insistence , over Wagner 's objections , that the premieres of the two completed Ring operas , Das Rheingold and Die Walküre , be given at once , in Munich , rather than as part of a complete Ring cycle on some future date at a venue of Wagner 's choosing . To Wagner 's mortification these premieres took place , under Franz Wüllner , on 22 September 1869 and 26 June 1870 respectively . The need for a theatre of his own , and full artistic control , was now clear to Wagner . On 5 March 1870 Cosima , according to her journal , advised him to " look up the article on <unk> [ sic ] in the encyclopaedia " . Wagner knew the town from a short visit he had made there in 1835 ; he was attracted to it by its central location and by its quiet non @-@ fashionability . When he and Cosima visited in April 1871 they decided immediately that they would build their theatre there , and that the town would be their future home . 
 Wagner announced the first Bayreuth Festival for 1873 , at which his full Ring cycle would be performed . Aware of the honour that such an event would bring to the town , the local council donated a large plot of land — the " Green Hill " — overlooking the town , as a site for the theatre . Since Ludwig had declined to finance the project , the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the initial festival was deferred . By the spring of 1873 only a third of the required funds had been raised ; further pleas to Ludwig were initially ignored , but early in 1874 , with the entire project on the verge of collapse , the king relented and provided a loan . The full building programme included a handsome villa , " Wahnfried " , into which Wagner , with Cosima and the children , moved from their temporary accommodation on 18 April 1874 . The theatre was completed in 1875 , and the festival scheduled for the following year . Commenting on the struggle to finish the building Wagner remarked to Cosima : " Each stone is red with my blood and yours " . 
 During this period Cosima admitted to Liszt , who had taken minor orders in the Catholic Church , that she intended converting to Protestantism . Her motive may have been more the desire to maintain solidarity with Wagner than from religious conviction ; Hilmes maintains that at heart , " Cosima remained a pietistic Catholic until her dying day " . On 31 October 1872 Cosima received her first Protestant sacrament alongside Wagner : " a deeply moving occasion ... what a lovely thing religion is ! What other power could produce such feelings ! " 
 = = = = First festival = = = = 
 In March 1876 , Cosima and Wagner were in Berlin when they learned that Marie d 'Agoult had died in Paris . Unable to attend the funeral , Cosima expressed her feelings in a letter to her daughter Daniela : " There is nothing left for me to do , except to grieve for the woman that brought me into the world " . 
 From June onwards , Cosima 's journal entries consist almost entirely of comments on the forthcoming festival 's rehearsals , sometimes warmly approving , often critical and anxious ; for example , she found the costumes " reminiscent throughout of Red Indian chiefs ... all the marks of provincial tastelessness " . From the beginning of August 1876 distinguished guests began to converge on the town ; Ludwig , incognito , attended the final dress rehearsals between 6 and 9 August , but then left the town , reappearing in time to attend the final performances of the festival . Among other royal visitors were the German emperor Wilhelm I , Dom Pedro II of Brazil and an assortment of princes and grand dukes from the European royal families . Many of Europe 's leading composers came : Bruckner , Tchaikovsky , Saint @-@ Saëns , and Cosima 's father , Liszt , who held court at Wahnfried among the notables who gathered there . Also in Bayreuth was Wagner 's current mistress , Judith Gautier . It is unlikely that Cosima knew of the affair at this time , though she may have harboured a degree of suspicion . Cosima 's demeanour as the festival 's hostess was described by a young American visitor in fulsome terms : " Mme Wagner is exceedingly gracious and affable ... a magnificent @-@ looking woman , a perfect queen ... " 
 The festival began on 13 August and lasted until 30th . It consisted of three full Ring cycles , all under the baton of Hans Richter . At the end , critical reactions ranged between that of the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg , who thought the entire work " divinely composed " , and that of the French newspaper Le Figaro who called the music " the dream of a lunatic " . Wagner himself was far from satisfied ; in a letter to Ludwig he denounced the singers Albert Niemann and Franz Betz as " theatrical parasites " and complained that Richter had not got a single tempo correct . Months later , Cosima records , his attitude towards the productions was " Never again , never again ! " . 
 = = = = Parsifal = = = = 
 After the conclusion of the festival and the departure of the guests , Wagner and Cosima left with the children for Venice , where they remained until December . The festival had accumulated a large financial deficit ; this , and Wagner 's deep artistic dissatisfaction , precluded the possibility of any repeat in the near future . Wagner 's mood was such that he seriously contemplated giving up the entire Bayreuth project ; he was distracted from such thoughts by an invitation to conduct a series of concerts in London . Leaving the children behind , he and Cosima enjoyed a two @-@ month break in England where , among others , Cosima met the novelist George Eliot , the poet Robert Browning , and the painter Edward Burne @-@ Jones ( who made a number of sketches of Cosima from which no finished painting emerged ) . On 17 May both Wagners were received by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle . 
 The English tour raised little money but restored Wagner 's spirits . On his return he began work on what would prove to be his final stage work , Parsifal , a project that would occupy him for most of the next five years . Cosima 's influence was such that Wagner asserted that he would not have written another note , had she not been there . On a practical level , when the festival 's creditors began to press for payment , Cosima 's personal plea to Ludwig in 1878 persuaded the king to provide a loan to pay off the outstanding debt and open the door to the prospect of a second Bayreuth Festival . For Cosima 's birthday on 25 December 1878 , Wagner hired an orchestra to play the newly composed prelude to Parsifal . The concert also included the Siegfried Idyll ; Cosima wrote afterwards : " There stands he who has called forth these wonders , and he loves me . He loves me ! " . 
 Progress on Parsifal was hampered by Wagner 's recurrent ill @-@ health , but by late 1880 he announced the next festival for 1882 , to be devoted entirely to the new work . Wagner secured Ludwig 's agreement that Parsifal should be staged exclusively at Bayreuth , but in return , Ludwig required that his current Munich Kapellmeister , Hermann Levi , should conduct the festival . Wagner objected on the grounds of Levi 's Jewish faith ; Parsifal , he maintained , was a " Christian " opera . Both he and Cosima were vehement anti @-@ Semites ; Hilmes conjectures that Cosima inherited this in her youth , from her father , from Carolyne zu Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein , probably from Madame Patersi and , a little later , from Bülow , " an anti @-@ Semite of the first order " . Thus Cosima 's anti @-@ Semitism predates her association with Wagner , although Marek observes that he nurtured it in her , to the extent that derogatory references to Jews occur , on average , on every fourth page of her 5 @,@ 000 @-@ page journal . The musicologist Eric Werner argues that Wagner 's anti @-@ Semitism derived in part from his initial revolutionary philosophy ; as a disciple of Proudhon he saw Jewry as " the embodiment of possession , of monopoly capitalism " . Cosima 's had no such basis , and whereas Wagner retained an ability to revise his views on the basis of his experiences , Cosima 's anti @-@ Semitism was visceral and remained unchanged . Cosima records Levi 's astonishment on being informed of his appointment . Ludwig was insistent that , despite Wagner 's objections , the appointment would stand . Levi would subsequently establish himself as the supreme conductor of the work , held by critical opinion to be " beyond praise " . 
 At the second Bayreuth Festival Parsifal was performed 16 times ; at the last performance on 29 August , Wagner himself conducted the final scene . Cosima wrote afterwards of how different the orchestra and singers sounded under Wagner . Overall , she and Wagner were entirely satisfied with the outcome of the festival which , unlike its predecessor , had made a handsome profit . : " [ N ] ot once did the spirit of toil and dedication on the part of the artists abate ... I believe one may be satisfied " . One dissident voice was that of Friedrich Nietzsche , once a devoted friend of Wagner 's but latterly a harsh critic . Nietzsche considered Parsifal an abomination for which Cosima was responsible ; she had corrupted Wagner , and as a non @-@ German she had no business meddling in matters of German culture . 
 = = = Venice and widowhood = = = 
 At the conclusion of the festival the Wagner family departed for an extended stay in Venice . To accommodate the large party of children , servants and expected guests they took a spacious apartment in the Palazzo <unk> <unk> , overlooking the Grand Canal . The principal concern during the autumn and winter months was Wagner 's declining health ; his heart spasms had become so frequent that on 16 November 1882 Cosima recorded : " Today he did not have a spasm ! " . Cosima 's journal entry for 12 February 1883 — the last she was to make — records Wagner reading <unk> 's novel Undine , and playing the Rhinemaidens ' lament from Das Rheingold on the piano . However , an underlying cause of domestic friction may have surfaced concerning Carrie Pringle , an English soprano from the Parsifal cast who was rumoured to be having an affair with Wagner . According to Isolde , recalling the occasion much later , the Pringle suspicions led to a furious row between Cosima and Wagner on the morning of 13 February . There is no solid evidence of an affair between Wagner and Pringle , nor is Isolde 's story of a row supported by any other testimony . At around noon on that day , Wagner suffered a fatal heart attack , and died in the middle of the afternoon . 
 Cosima sat with Wagner 's body for more than 24 hours , refusing all refreshment or respite . During the embalming process , which occupied the next two days , Cosima sat with the body as often as possible , to the dismay of her children . She also asked her daughters to cut her hair , which was then sewn into a cushion and placed on Wagner 's breast . On 16 February the journey back to Bayreuth began , and on Sunday 18 February the cortège processed to Wahnfried , where , following a brief service , Wagner was buried in the garden . Cosima remained in the house until the ceremonies were over ; according to her daughter Daniela she then went to the grave " and for a long time lay down on the coffin until <unk> ( Siegfried ) went to fetch her " . Afterwards she went into seclusion for many months , barely even seeing her children , with whom she communicated mainly through written notes . Among many messages , she received a telegram from Bülow : " <unk> il faut vivre " ( " Sister , it is necessary to live " ) . 
 = = Mistress of Bayreuth = =

 Wagner had left neither a will , nor instruction on the management of the Bayreuth Festival after his death . He had written of the future : " I ... cannot think of a single person who could say what I believe needs to be said ... there is practically no one on whose judgement I could rely " . The festival 's uncertain outlook was aggravated by Cosima 's total withdrawal from all contact except that of her daughters and her friend and adviser Adolf von Groß . Without Cosima 's participation the 1883 festival , as planned by Wagner — 12 performances of Parsifal — went ahead , with Emil <unk> ( who sang the role of Gurnemanz in the opera ) doubling as artistic director . The cast was largely that of 1882 , and Levi remained as conductor . 
 At the conclusion of the festival Cosima received a long , critical memorandum from an unknown observer , which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner 's directions . This , says Marek , proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life 's mission : the maintenance of Wagner 's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations . In her seclusion , Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius <unk> , the festival 's chorus @-@ master , by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor . Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement , and the plan died . With Groß 's assistance , Cosima pre @-@ empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy , by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner 's property , physical and intellectual . By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival 's future . 
 = = = In control = = = 
 In 1885 Cosima announced that she would direct the 1886 festival . Her tenure as Bayreuth 's director lasted for 22 years , until 1907 . During that time she oversaw 13 festivals , and by gradually increasing the repertory established the " Bayreuth canon " of ten mature Wagner works . Her triumvirate of conductors — Levi , Richter and Felix Mottl — shared the musical direction until 1894 , when Levi left . Richter and Mottl served throughout Cosima 's years , joined by several of the leading conductors of the day , although Bülow resisted all offers to participate . In the course of her long stewardship Cosima overcame the misgivings of the hardline Wagnerites patrons who believed , like Nietzsche , that Wagner 's works should not be entrusted to a non @-@ German . Under her watch the festival moved from an uncertain financial basis into a prosperous business undertaking that brought great riches to the Wagner family . 
 Although the festival 's historian , Frederic Spotts , suggests that Cosima was more creative than she affected to be , the primary purpose of all her productions was to follow the instructions and reflect the wishes of the Master : " There is nothing left for us here to create , but only to perfect in detail " . This policy incurred criticism , among others from Bernard Shaw , who in 1889 mocked Cosima as the " chief <unk> " . Shaw scorned the idea that Wagner 's wishes were best represented by the slavish copying in perpetuity of the performances he had witnessed . Ten years later Shaw highlighted as a feature of the " Bayreuth style " the " intolerably old @-@ fashioned tradition of half rhetorical , half historical @-@ pictorial attitudes and gestures " , and the characteristic singing , " sometime tolerable , sometimes abominable " . The subordination of the music to text , diction and character portrayal was a specific feature of the Bayreuth style ; Cosima , according to Spotts , turned the principle of clear enunciation into " a fetish ... The resulting harsh declamatory style came to be derided as ... the infamous Bayreuth bark " . 
 Parsifal was shown alongside other works at each of Cosima 's festivals except for 1896 , which was devoted to a revival of the Ring cycle . In 1886 , her first year in charge , she added Tristan und Isolde to the canon . Amid the bustle of the festival Cosima refused to be distracted by the illness of her father , Liszt , who collapsed after attending a performance of Tristan and died several days later . Cosima supervised her father 's funeral service and burial arrangements , but refused a memorial concert or any overt display of remembrance . According to Liszt 's pupil Felix Weingartner , " Liszt 's passing was not of sufficient importance to dim the glory of the Festival , even for a moment " . 
 Die Meistersinger was added in 1888 , Tannhäuser in 1891 , Lohengrin in 1894 and Der fliegende Holländer in 1901 . After the 1894 festival Levi resigned , the years of working in an anti @-@ Semitic ambience having finally had their effect . At the 1896 festival Siegfried made his Bayreuth conducting debut in one of the five Ring cycles ; he remained one of Bayreuth 's regular conductors for the remainder of Cosima 's tenure . 
 In common with Wagner , Cosima was willing to shelve her anti @-@ Semitic prejudices in the interests of Bayreuth , to the extent of continuing to employ Levi for whom she developed considerable artistic respect . However , she frequently undermined him behind his back in private letters , and allowed her children to mimic and mock him . Cosima expressed to Weingartner the view that " between Aryan and Semite blood there could exist no bond whatever " . In accordance with this doctrine , she would not invite Gustav Mahler ( born Jewish though a convert to Catholicism ) to conduct at Bayreuth , although she frequently took his advice over artistic matters . 
 Cosima was determined to preserve Bayreuth 's exclusive right , acknowledged by Ludwig , to perform Parsifal . After Ludwig 's death in 1886 this right was briefly challenged by his successor , an attempt swiftly defeated by Cosima with the help of Groß . A more serious threat arose from the German copyright laws , which only protected works for 30 years following the creator 's death ; thus Parsifal would lose its protection in 1913 regardless of any agreement with the Bavarian court . In anticipation , in 1901 Cosima sought to have the period of copyright protection extended by law to 50 years . She lobbied members of the Reichstag tirelessly , and was assured by Kaiser Wilhelm II of his support . These efforts failed to bring about any change in the law . In 1903 , taking advantage of the lack of a copyright agreement between the United States and Germany , Heinrich <unk> of the New York Metropolitan Opera announced that he would stage Parsifal later that year . Cosima was enraged , but her efforts to prevent him were to no avail ; the first of 11 performances took place on 24 December 1903 . The enterprise was a popular and critical success , though in Cosima 's view it was a " rape " ; her hostility towards the Metropolitan lasted for the remainder of her life . 
 By the beginning of the new century three of Cosima 's daughters had married : Blandina to Count Biagio Gravina in the closing days of the 1882 festival , Daniela to Henry Thode , an art historian , on 3 July 1886 , and Isolde , Cosima 's first child by Wagner , who married a young conductor , Franz Beidler , on 20 December 1900 The youngest daughter , Eva , rejected numerous suitors to remain her mother 's secretary and companion for the rest of Cosima 's tenure . 
 = = = Transfer of power = = = 
 On 8 December 1906 , having directed that year 's festival , Cosima suffered an Adams @-@ Stokes seizure ( a form of heart attack ) while visiting her friend Prince Hohenlohe at Langenburg . By May 1907 it was clear that her health was such that she could no longer remain in charge at Bayreuth ; this responsibility now passed to Siegfried , her long @-@ designated heir . The succession was accomplished against a background of family disagreement ; Beidler thought that he had rights , based partly on his greater conducting experience and also because he and Isolde had produced Wagner 's only grandchild , a son born in October 1901 , who could establish a dynastic succession . Beidler 's claims were dismissed by Cosima and by Siegfried ; he never conducted at Bayreuth again , and the rift between the <unk> and Cosima developed in due course into a major family feud . 
 = = Retirement , decline and death = = 
 Cosima moved into rooms to the rear of Wahnfried , away from the house 's daily bustle , where she passed her days surrounded by Wagner 's possessions and numerous family portraits . Although at first Siegfried discussed his festival plans with her , she avoided the <unk> , content to read reports of the productions . Siegfried made few changes to the production traditions set by Wagner and Cosima ; Spotts records that " whatever had been laid down by his parents was preserved unchanged out of a sense of strict filial duty " . Only in matters on which they had not spoken was he prepared to exercise his own judgement . As a result , the original Parsifal sets remained in use even when they were visibly crumbling ; the view of Cosima and her daughters was that no changes should ever be made to stage sets " on which the eye of the Master had rested " . 
 In December 1908 Eva , then 41 , married Houston Stewart Chamberlain , a British @-@ born historian who had adopted as his personal creed a fanatical form of German nationalism based on principles of extreme racial and cultural purity . He had known Cosima since 1888 , though his affinity with Wagner extended back to 1882 , when he had attended the premiere of Parsifal . He had successively courted Blandina and then Isolde , before settling on Eva . Cosima had considerable empathy with his theories ; according to Carr " she came to love him as her son — perhaps even more " . Chamberlain became the dominant figure within the Wagner circle , and was largely responsible for the increasing alienation of the <unk> . Cosima may have been unaware of Isolde 's attempts at rapprochement , because Eva and Chamberlain withheld Isolde 's letters . In 1913 Isolde was effectively disinherited when she sought to confirm her rights as a co @-@ heir to the considerable Wagner fortunes in a court case , which she lost . After this she withdrew , and to the time of her death in 1919 never again saw or communicated directly with Cosima . 
 A happier family event from Cosima 's standpoint was Siegfried 's marriage in 1915 , at the age of 46 , to Winifred Williams , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old foster @-@ daughter of Karl Klindworth who had been friends with both Wagner and Liszt . When the couple 's first son , Wieland , was born on 5 January 1917 , Cosima celebrated by playing excerpts from the Siegfried Idyll on Wagner 's piano . 
 The outbreak of the First World War curtailed the 1914 festival ; the conflict and the political and economic upheavals that followed the war closed the <unk> until 1924 . Plans for the festival 's resumption coincided with an upsurge in Germany of extreme nationalist politics . Adolf Hitler , a fervent Wagner admirer , first visited Wahnfried in 1923 , and although he was not received by Cosima he befriended the family and was thereafter a regular visitor . The <unk> , together with Winifred , became enthusiastic members of the Nazi Party , and the 1924 festival became an overt rally for the party and its leading supporters . That year Cosima , then 86 , ended her long absence from the theatre by attending the dress rehearsals for Parsifal , and watching the first act at the opening performance on 23 July . The tenor Lauritz Melchior remembered Siegfried returning from frequent visits to a small gallery above the stage and saying " Mama wants ... " 
 By 1927 , the year of her 90th birthday , Cosima 's health was failing . The birthday was marked in Bayreuth by the naming of a street in her honour , although she was unaware ; the family thought that knowledge of the celebrations would <unk> her . In her last years she was virtually bedridden , became blind , and was only lucid at intervals . She died , aged 92 , on 1 April 1930 ; after a funeral service at Wahnfried her body was taken to Coburg and cremated . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Cosima 's life mission was total service to Wagner and his works ; in the words of the music critic Eric Salzman she " submitted herself body and soul to the Master " . In Wagner 's lifetime she fulfilled this purpose primarily by recording in her journal every facet of his life and ideas . After his death the journal was abandoned ; she would henceforth serve the master by perpetuating his artistic heritage through the Bayreuth Festival . Guided by Groß , but also using her own acumen — Werner calls her a " superb business woman " — she succeeded in making the festival first solvent , then profitable . 
 While acknowledging that Cosima was an effective " keeper of the flame " , commentators have criticised the nature of her legacy . The Ring historian J.K. Holman describes it as one of " stifling conservatism " . Her policy of sticking to Wagner 's original stage conceptions was not fully abandoned until after the Second World War , when a new generation took charge of the festival . Hilmes likens Cosima 's role to that of the abbess of a religious community : " a cohesive , quasi @-@ religious congregation of <unk> sharing a common philosophical outlook " . Anti @-@ Semitism was integral to this philosophy ; although in 1869 Cosima had opposed the re @-@ publication of Wagner 's anti @-@ Jewish treatise Jewishness in Music , this was on grounds of commercial prudence rather than sensitivity . In 1881 she encouraged Wagner to write his essay " Know <unk> " , and to include in it a tirade against Jewish assimilation . 
 The critic and one @-@ time librettist Philip Hensher writes that " under the guidance of her repulsive racial @-@ theorist son @-@ in @-@ law [ Chamberlain ] ... Cosima tried to turn Bayreuth into a centre for the cult of German purity . " Thus , he continues , " By the time she died , Wagner 's reputation was ... at the forefront of a terrible political dynamism : antique stagings of his works were presented to audiences of Brownshirts " . The close association of the festival with Hitler and the Nazis during the 1930s was much more the work of Winifred — an overt Hitler supporter — than of Cosima , though Hensher asserts that " Cosima was as much to blame as anyone " . 
 In the immediate aftermath of Cosima 's death , some writers heaped copious praise on her . Ernest Newman , Wagner 's biographer , called her " the greatest figure that ever came within [ Wagner 's ] circle " ; Richard du Moulin Eckart , Cosima 's first biographer , introduced her as " the greatest woman of the century " . In time judgements became more measured , and divided . Marek closes his account by emphasising her role not only as Wagner 's protector but as his muse : " Without her there would have been no Siegfried Idyll , no Bayreuth , and no Parsifal " . In Hensher 's judgement , " Wagner was a genius , but also a fairly appalling human being . Cosima was just an appalling human being . " In 1977 , 47 years after her death , Cosima 's urn was recovered from Coburg and buried alongside Wagner in the Wahnfried garden .

 Star Trek : The Motion Picture is a 1979 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures . It is the first Star Trek film and stars the cast of the original 1966 – 1969 Star Trek television series . The film is set in the twenty @-@ third century when a mysterious and immensely powerful alien cloud known as V 'Ger approaches Earth , destroying everything in its path . Admiral James T. Kirk ( William Shatner ) resumes command of his previous starship — the recently refitted USS Enterprise — to lead it on a mission to save the planet and determine V 'Ger 's origins . 
 When the original television series was cancelled in 1969 , Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry lobbied Paramount to continue the franchise through a film . The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on a feature film in 1975 . A series of writers attempted to craft a suitably epic script , but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount , so the studio scrapped the project in 1977 . Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series , Star Trek : Phase II . The box office success of Close Encounters of the Third Kind convinced Paramount that science fiction films other than Star Wars could do well at the box office , so the studio cancelled production of Phase II and resumed its attempts at making a Star Trek film . In 1978 , Paramount assembled the largest press conference held at the studio since the 1950s to announce that double Academy Award – winning director Robert Wise would direct a $ 15 million film adaptation of the television series . 
 With the cancellation of Phase II , writers rushed to adapt its planned pilot episode , " In Thy Image " , into a film script . Constant revisions to the story and shooting script continued , to the extent of hourly script updates on shooting dates . The Enterprise was modified inside and out ; costume designer Robert Fletcher provided new uniforms and production designer Harold Michelson fabricated new sets . Jerry Goldsmith composed the score , beginning an association with Star Trek that would continue until 2002 . When the original contractors for the optical effects proved unable to complete their tasks in time , effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull was given carte blanche to meet the December 1979 release date . The film came together only days before the premiere ; Wise took the just @-@ completed film to its Washington , D.C. , opening , but always felt that the theatrical version was a rough cut of the film he wanted to make . 
 Released in North America on December 7 , 1979 , Star Trek : The Motion Picture received mixed reviews from critics , many of whom faulted the film for its lack of action and over @-@ reliance on special effects . The final production cost ballooned to approximately $ 46 million . The film earned $ 139 million worldwide , falling short of studio expectations but enough for Paramount to propose a cheaper sequel . Roddenberry was forced out of creative control for The Wrath of Khan . In 2001 , Wise oversaw a director 's cut for a special DVD release of the film , with remastered audio , tightened and added scenes , and new computer @-@ generated effects . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In <unk> , a Starfleet monitoring station , Epsilon Nine , detects an alien force , hidden in a massive cloud of energy , moving through space towards Earth . The cloud destroys three of the Klingon Empire 's new K <unk> @-@ class warships and the monitoring station en route . On Earth , the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit ; her former commanding officer , James T. Kirk , has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations . Starfleet dispatches Enterprise to investigate the cloud entity as the ship is the only one in intercept range , requiring her new systems to be tested in transit . 
 Kirk takes command of the ship citing his experience , angering Captain Willard Decker , who had been overseeing the refit as its new commanding officer . Testing of Enterprise 's new systems goes poorly ; two officers , including the science officer , are killed by a malfunctioning transporter , and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship . Kirk 's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker . Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer , explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion , he felt a consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud . 
 Enterprise intercepts the energy cloud and is attacked by an alien vessel within . A probe appears on the bridge , attacks Spock and abducts the navigator , Ilia . She is replaced by a robotic doppelgänger , a probe sent by " V 'Ger " to study the crew . Decker is distraught over the loss of Ilia , with whom he had a romantic history . He becomes troubled as he attempts to extract information from the doppelgänger , which has Ilia 's memories and feelings buried within . Spock takes a spacewalk to the alien vessel 's interior and attempts a telepathic mind meld with it . In doing so , he learns that the vessel is V 'Ger itself , a living machine . 
 At the center of the massive ship , V 'Ger is revealed to be Voyager 6 , a 20th @-@ century Earth space probe believed lost . The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned , and return that information to its creator . The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission , and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness . Spock realizes that V 'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission ; having learned what it could on its journey home , it finds its existence empty and without purpose . Before transmitting all its information , V 'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence . Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator , Decker offers himself to V 'Ger ; he merges with the Ilia probe and V 'Ger , creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension . With Earth saved , Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions .

 William Shatner as James T. Kirk , the former commanding officer of the USS Enterprise and an Admiral at Starfleet headquarters , who re @-@ assumes command of the Enterprise , and with it , temporary demotion to his previous rank , captain . When asked during a March 1978 press conference about what it would be like to reprise the role , Shatner said , " An actor brings to a role not only the concept of a character but his own basic personality , things that he is , and both Leonard Nimoy and myself have changed over the years , to a degree at any rate , and we will bring that degree of change inadvertently to the role we recreate . " 
 Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock , the Enterprise 's half @-@ Vulcan , half @-@ human science officer . Nimoy had been dissatisfied with unpaid royalties from Star Trek and did not intend to reprise the role , so Spock was left out of the screenplay . Director Robert Wise , having been informed by his daughter and son @-@ in @-@ law that the film " would not be Star Trek " without Nimoy , sent Jeffrey Katzenberg to New York City to meet with Nimoy . Katzenberg gave Nimoy a check to make up for his lost royalties , and the actor attended the March 1978 press conference with the rest of the returning cast . Nimoy was dissatisfied with the script , and his meeting with Katzenberg led to an agreement that the final script would need Nimoy 's approval . Despite the financial issues , Nimoy said he was comfortable with being identified as Mr. Spock because it had a positive impact on his fame . 
 DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy , the chief medical officer aboard the Enterprise . Kelley had reservations with the script , feeling that the characters and relationships from the series were not in place . Along with Shatner and Nimoy , Kelley lobbied for greater characterization , but their opinions were largely ignored . 
 James Doohan as Montgomery Scott , the Enterprise 's chief engineer . Doohan created the distinctive Klingon vocabulary heard in the film . Linguist Marc Okrand later developed a fully realized Klingon language based on the actor 's made @-@ up words . 
 Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov , the Enterprise 's weapons officer . Koenig noted that the expected sense of camaraderie and euphoria at being assembled for screen tests at the start of the picture was nonexistent . " This may be Star Trek , " he wrote , " but it isn 't the old Star Trek . " The actor was hopeful for the film , but admitted he was disappointed by his character 's bit part . 
 Nichelle Nichols as Uhura , the communications officer aboard the Enterprise . Nichols noted in her autobiography that she was one of the actors most opposed to the new uniforms added for the film because the drab , unisex look " wasn 't Uhura " . 
 George Takei as Hikaru Sulu , the Enterprise 's helmsman . In his autobiography , Takei described the film 's shooting schedule as " astonishingly luxurious " , but noted that frequent script rewrites during production " usually favored Bill " [ Shatner ] . 
 Persis Khambatta as Ilia , the <unk> navigator of the Enterprise . Khambatta was originally cast in the role when The Motion Picture was a television pilot . She took the role even after Roddenberry warned her that she would have to shave her head completely for filming . 
 Stephen Collins as Willard Decker , the new commanding officer of the Enterprise at the start of the film . He is temporarily demoted from captain to commander and first officer when Kirk takes command of the Enterprise . Collins was completely unfamiliar with the franchise , having never seen an episode of the series . Kelley 's dressing room was next to Collins ' , and the older actor became his mentor for the production . Given the preexisting television cast , Collins ' casting was the only one that director Wise participated in ; he called Collins ' performance " excellent — in a difficult role . " 
 Other actors from the television series who returned include Majel Barrett as Christine Chapel , a doctor aboard the Enterprise ; and Grace Lee Whitney as Janice Rand , formerly one of Kirk 's yeomen and now a transporter operator . David <unk> , who had been cast as Xon in the aborted second television series , cameos as Branch , the commander of the Epsilon 9 communications station . Mark Lenard portrays the Klingon commander in the film 's opening sequence ; he also played Spock 's father , Sarek , in the television series and in later feature films .

 The original Star Trek television series ran for three seasons from 1966 to 1969 on NBC . The show was never a hit with network executives , and the show 's low Nielsen ratings bolstered their concerns . When the show was cancelled , owner Paramount Studios hoped to recoup their production losses by selling the syndication rights to the show . The series went into reruns in the autumn ( September / October ) of 1969 , and by the late 1970s had been sold in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets . The show developed a cult following , and rumors of reviving the franchise began . 
 Roddenberry had first proposed a Star Trek feature at the 1968 World Science Fiction Convention . The movie was to have been set before the television series , showing how the crew of the Enterprise met . The popularity of the syndicated Star Trek caused Paramount Pictures and Roddenberry to begin developing the film in May 1975 . Roddenberry was allocated $ 3 to $ 5 million to develop a script . By June 30 , he had produced what he considered an acceptable script , but studio executives disagreed . This first draft , The God Thing , featured a grounded Admiral Kirk assembling the old crew on the refitted Enterprise to clash with a godlike entity many miles across , hurtling towards Earth . The object turns out to be a super @-@ advanced computer , the remains of a scheming race who were cast out of their dimension . Kirk wins out , the entity returns to its dimension , and the Enterprise crew resumes their voyages . The basic premise and scenes such as a transporter accident and Spock 's Vulcan ritual were discarded , but later returned to the final script . The film was postponed until spring ( March / April ) 1975 while Paramount fielded new scripts for Star Trek II ( the working title ) from acclaimed writers such as Ray Bradbury , Theodore Sturgeon and Harlan Ellison . Ellison 's story had a snake @-@ like alien race tampering with Earth 's history to create a kindred race ; Kirk reunites with his old crew , but they are faced with the dilemma of killing off the reptilian race in Earth 's prehistory just to maintain humanity 's dominance . When Ellison presented his idea , an executive suggested Ellison read Chariots of the Gods ? and include the Maya civilization into his story , which enraged the writer because he knew Mayans did not exist at the dawn of time . By October 1975 , Robert Silverberg had been signed to work on the screenplay along with a second writer , John D. F. Black , whose treatment featured a black hole that threatened to consume all of existence . Roddenberry teamed up with Jon Povill to write a new story that featured the Enterprise crew setting an altered universe right by time travel ; like Black 's idea , Paramount did not consider it epic enough . 
 The original Star Trek cast — who had agreed to appear in the new movie , with contracts as @-@ yet unsigned pending script approval — grew anxious about the constant delays , and pragmatically accepted other acting offers while Roddenberry worked with Paramount . The studio decided to turn the project over to the television division , reasoning that since the roots of the franchise lay in television the writers would be able to develop the right script . A number of screenwriters offered up ideas that were summarily rejected . As Paramount executives ' interest in the film began to wane , Roddenberry , backed by fan letters , applied pressure to the studio . In June 1976 , Paramount assigned Jerry Isenberg , a young and active producer , to be executive producer of the project , with the budget expanded to $ 8 million . Povill was tasked with finding more writers to develop a script . His list included Edward Anhalt , James Goldman , Francis Ford Coppola , George Lucas , Ernest Lehman and Robert Bloch . To cap off his list , Povill put as his last recommendation " Jon Povill — almost credit : Star Trek II story ( with Roddenberry ) . Will be a big shot some day . Should be hired now while he is cheap and humble . " The end result was a compiled list of 34 names , none of whom were ever chosen to pen the script . Finally , British screenwriters Chris Bryant and Allan Scott , who had penned the creepy Donald Sutherland thriller Don 't Look Now were hired to write a script . Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on ; " one of Horatio Nelson 's captains in the South Pacific , six months away from home and three months away by communication " . Povill also wrote up a list of possible directors , including Coppola , Steven Spielberg , Lucas and Robert Wise , but all were busy at the time ( or were not willing to work on the small script money budget ) . Philip Kaufman signed on to direct and was given a crash course in the series . Roddenberry screened ten episodes from the original series for Kaufman , including the most representative of the show and those he considered most popular : " The City on the Edge of Forever " , " The Devil in the Dark " , " Amok Time " , " Journey to Babel " , " Shore Leave " , " The Trouble with Tribbles " , " The Enemy Within " , " The <unk> Maneuver " , " This Side of Paradise " and " A Piece of the Action " . Early work was promising and , by the fall of 1976 , the project was building momentum . 
 During this time , fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the White House with letters , influencing Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise . , and Roddenberry and most of the Star Trek cast were present for its roll @-@ out on September 17 , 1976 . 
 On October 8 , Bryant and Scott delivered a twenty @-@ page treatment entitled Planet of the Titans , which executives Barry Diller and Michael Eisner liked . In the treatment , Kirk and his crew encounter beings they believe to be the mythical Titans and travel back millions of years in time , accidentally teaching early man to make fire . Planet of the Titans also explored the concept of the third eye . With the studio 's acceptance of this treatment Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek , and the screenwriters and Isenberg were swamped with grateful fan mail . Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators . Key amongst these were famed production designer Ken Adam , who said that " I was approached by Gene Roddenberry and we got on like a house on fire " , and thus he was employed to design the film . In turn Adam employed artist Ralph McQuarrie fresh off the yet to be released Star Wars . They worked on designs for planets , planetary and asteroid bases , a black hole " shroud " , a crystalline " super brain " , and new concepts for the Enterprise , including interior concepts which Adam later <unk> for the film Moonraker and a flat @-@ hulled starship design ( frequently credited to McQuarrie , but which McQuarrie 's own art of book identifies as an Adam design ) . McQuarrie wrote that " there was no script " thus much of the work was " winging it " . When that film folded after three months for Adam and " a month and a half " for McQuarrie , their concepts were shelved , although a handful of them were revisited in later productions . 
 The first draft of the completed script was not finished until March 1 , 1977 , and it was described as " a script by committee " and rejected by the studio a few weeks later . Bryant and Scott had been caught between Roddenberry and Kaufman 's conflicting ideas about of what the film should be and Paramount 's indecision . Feeling it was " physically impossible " to produce a script that satisfied all parties , they left the project by mutual consent on March 18 , 1977 . " We begged to be fired . " Kaufman reconceived the story with Spock as the captain of his own ship and featuring Toshiro Mifune as Spock 's Klingon nemesis , but on May 8 Katzenberg informed the director the film was cancelled , less than three weeks before Star Wars would be released .

 Barry Diller had grown concerned by the direction Star Trek had taken in Planet of the Titans , and suggested to Roddenberry that it was time to take the franchise back to its roots as a television series . Diller planned on a new Star Trek series forming the cornerstone for a new television network . Though Paramount was loath to abandon its work on the film , Roddenberry wanted to bring many of the production staff from the original series to work on the new show , titled Star Trek : Phase II . 
 Producer Harold Livingston was assigned to find writers for new episodes , while Roddenberry prepared a writers ' guide briefing the uninitiated on the franchise canon . Of the original cast , only Leonard Nimoy stated he would not return . To replace Spock , Roddenberry created a logical Vulcan prodigy named Xon . Since Xon was too young to fill the role of first officer , Roddenberry developed Commander William Decker , and later added Ilia . The new series ' pilot episode " In Thy Image " was based on a two @-@ page outline by Roddenberry about a NASA probe returning to Earth , having gained sentience . Alan Dean Foster wrote a treatment for the pilot , which Livingston turned into a teleplay . When the script was presented to Michael Eisner , he declared it worthy of being told as a feature film . At the same time , the success of Close Encounters of the Third Kind showed Paramount that Star Wars ' success in the science fiction genre at the box office could repeat . On November 11 , just two and a half weeks before production on Phase II was due to start , the studio announced that the television series had been cancelled in favor of a new feature film . Cast and crew who had been hired that Monday were laid off by Friday , and construction came to a halt . Production was moved to April 1978 so that the necessary scripts , sets , and wardrobe could be upgraded . 
 On March 28 , 1978 , Paramount assembled the largest press conference held at the studio since Cecil B. DeMille announced he was making The Ten Commandments . Eisner announced that Academy @-@ Award winning director Robert Wise would direct a film adaptation of the television series , titled Star Trek — The Motion Picture . Wise had only seen a few Star Trek episodes , so Paramount gave him about a dozen to watch . The budget was projected at $ 15 million . Dennis Clark ( Comes a Horseman ) was invited to rewrite the script and to include Spock , but he disliked Roddenberry , who demanded sole credit . Livingston returned as writer , and although he also found Roddenberry unreasonable , Wise and Katzenberg convinced him to continue rewriting the script throughout production . 
 The writers began to adapt " In Thy Image " into a film script , but the script was not completed until four months after production commenced . Wise felt that the story was sound , but the action and visuals could be made more exciting . As the intended start of filming in late spring 1978 approached , it was clear a new start date was needed . Time was of the essence ; Paramount was worried that their science fiction film would appear at the tail end of a cycle , now that every major studio had such a film in the works . Livingston described the writers ' issue with the story , calling it " unworkable " : 
 We had a marvelous antagonist , so omnipotent that for us to defeat it or even communicate with it , or have any kind of relationship with it , made the initial concept of the story false . Here 's this gigantic machine that 's a million years further advanced than we are . Now , how the hell can we possibly deal with this ? On what level ? As the story developed , everything worked until the very end . How do you resolve this thing ? If humans can defeat this marvelous machine , it 's really not so great , is it ? Or if it really is great , will we like those humans who do defeat it ? Should they defeat it ? Who is the story 's hero anyway ? That was the problem . We experimented with all kinds of approaches ... we didn 't know what to do with the ending . We always ended up against a blank wall . 
 The script received constant input from the producers and from Shatner and Nimoy . The discussions led to repeated rewrites , right up to the day the pages were to be shot . At one point , scenes were being rewritten so often it became necessary to note on script pages the hour of the revision . Though changes were constant , the biggest push for alteration revolved around the ending . Much of the rewriting had to do with the relationships of Kirk and Spock , Decker and Ilia , and the Enterprise and V 'ger . A final draft of the third act was approved in late September 1978 , but had it not been for a Penthouse interview where NASA director Robert Jastrow said that mechanical forms of life were likely , the ending may not have been approved at all . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The first new sets ( intended for Phase II ) were constructed beginning July 25 , 1977 . The fabrication was supervised by Joseph Jennings , an art director involved in the original television series , special @-@ effects expert Jim Rugg , and former Trek designer Matt Jefferies , on loan as consultant from Little House on the Prairie . When the television series was cancelled and plans for a film put into place , new sets were needed for the large 70 mm film format . 
 Wise asked Harold Michelson to be the film 's production designer , and Michelson was put to work on finishing the incomplete Phase II sets . The designer began with the bridge , which had nearly been completed . Michelson first removed Chekov 's new weapons station , a semicircular plastic bubble grafted onto one side of the bridge wall . The idea for Phase II was that Chekov would have looked out toward space while crosshairs in the bubble tracked targets . Wise instead wanted Chekov 's station to face the Enterprise 's main viewer , a difficult request as the set was primarily circular . Production illustrator Michael Minor created a new look for the station using a flat edge in the corner of the set . 
 The bridge ceiling was redesigned , with Michelson taking structural inspiration from a jet engine fan . Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling to give the bridge a human touch . Ostensibly , the bubble functioned as a piece of sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship 's attitude . Most of the bridge consoles , designed by Lee Cole , remained from the scrapped television series . Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created . To inform actors and series writers , Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions . It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat @-@ sensitive plates . The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25 watts to 6 watts after the generated heat began melting the controls . The seats were covered in girdle material , used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed . For the science station , two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use , but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered it would be easier to move them by hand . 
 Aside from control interfaces , the bridge set was populated with monitors looping animations . Each oval monitor was a rear @-@ projection screen on which super 8 mm and 16 mm film sequences looped for each special effect . The production acquired 42 films for this purpose from an Arlington , Virginia @-@ based company , <unk> Enterprises . <unk> 's footage was exhausted only a few weeks into filming , and it became clear that new monitor films would be needed faster than an outside supplier could deliver them . Cole , Minor , and another production designer , Rick Sternbach , worked together with Povill to devise faster ways of shooting new footage . Cole and Povill rented an oscilloscope for a day and filmed its distortions . Other loops came from Long Beach Hospital , the University of California at San Diego , and experimental computer labs in New Mexico . In all , over two hundred pieces of monitor footage were created and catalogued into a seven @-@ page listing . 
 The Enterprise engine room was redesigned while keeping consistent with the theory that the interior appearance had to match the corresponding area visible in exterior views of the starship . Michelson wanted the engine room to seem vast , a difficult effect to achieve on a small sound stage . To create the illusion of depth and long visible distances , the art department staff worked on designs that would utilize forced perspective ; set designer Lewis <unk> considered the engine room the most difficult set to realize . On film the engine room appeared hundreds of feet long , but the set was actually only 40 feet ( 12 m ) in length . To achieve the proper look , the floor slanted upward and narrowed , while small actors of three , four , and five feet in height were used as extras to give the appearance of being far from the camera . For " down shots " of the engineering complex , floor paintings extended the length of the warp core several stories . J.C. <unk> Company created these paintings ; similar backings were used to extend the length of ship hallways and the rec room set . 
 <unk> the Enterprise corridors was also Michelson 's responsibility . Originally the corridors were of straight plywood construction reminiscent of the original series , which Roddenberry referred to as " Des Moines Holiday Inn Style " . To move away from this hotel look , Michelson created a new bent and angular design . Roddenberry and Wise agreed with Michelson that in three hundred years , lighting did not need to be overhead , so they had the lighting radiate upward from the floor . Different lighting schemes were used to simulate different decks of the ship with the same length of corridor . Aluminum panels on the walls outside Kirk 's and Ilia 's quarters were covered with an orange <unk> to represent the living area of the ship . 
 The transporter had originally been developed for the television series as a matter of convenience ; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet . For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful . He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful forces at work . The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery , and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere . 
 After the redesign of the Enterprise sets was complete , Michelson turned his attention to creating the original sets needed for the film . The recreation deck occupied an entire soundstage , dwarfing the small room built for the planned television series ; this was the largest interior in the film . The set was 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) high , decorated with 107 pieces of custom @-@ designed furniture , and packed with 300 people for filming . Below a large viewing screen on one end of the set was a series of art panels containing illustrations of previous ships bearing the name Enterprise . One of the ships was NASA 's own Enterprise , added per Roddenberry 's request : 
 Some fans have suggested that our new Enterprise should carry a plaque somewhere which commemorates the fact it was named after the first space shuttle launched from Earth in 1970s . This is an intriguing idea . It also has publicity advantages if properly released at the right time . It won 't hurt NASA 's feelings either . I 'll leave it to you where you want it on the vessel . 
 Another large construction task was the V 'ger set , referred to by the production staff as " the Coliseum " or " the microwave wok " . The set was designed and fabricated in four and a half weeks , and was filmable from all angles ; parts of the set were designed to pull away for better camera access at the center . Throughout production Star Trek used eleven of Paramount 's thirty @-@ two sound stages , more than any other film done there at the time . To save money , construction coordinator Gene Kelley struck sets with his own crew immediately after filming , lest Paramount charge the production to have the sets dismantled . The final cost for constructing the sets ran at approximately $ 1 @.@ 99 million , not counting additional costs for Phase II fabrication . 
 = = = Props and models = = = 
 The first Star Trek movie models constructed were small study models for Planet of the Titans based on designs by Adam and McQuarrie , but these flat @-@ hulled Enterprise concepts were abandoned when that film was cancelled ( although one was later used in the <unk> in the movie Star Trek III , and another later appeared in the Star Trek : The Next Generation episode " The Best of Both Worlds " ) . 
 When the Phase II series was in development , original series designer Matt Jefferies updated the Enterprise design to feature a larger saucer with twin elevators ( <unk> ) to the bridge , a wider secondary hull , docking ports , a dedicated phaser weapon assembly at the base of the ship 's neck , and angled struts supporting the nacelles . The nacelles themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes and designed to feature glowing grilles on the sides . Likewise , an orbiting drydock , space office complex , and V 'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor . At the time Phase II was cancelled a roughly five foot long model of the Enterprise was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures , and models of the drydock and V 'ger were under construction as well . All of these models were abandoned , unfinished ( although a Brick Price Enterprise was repurposed as the exploded Enterprise wreck in Star Trek III ) . 
 When the project finally became The Motion Picture , Robert Abel and Associates art director Richard Taylor wanted to completely redesign the ship , but Roddenberry insisted on the same shape as designed by Jefferies for Phase II . Taylor focused on the details , giving it a stylization he considered " almost Art Deco " . Concept artist Andrew Probert helped refine the redesign . The general shape and proportions of the Phase II ship were retained , but the angles , curves and details refined . Taylor took on the nacelles , and Probert the rest of the ship . Changes included " radiator grill " nacelle caps , a glowing deflector dish , a new impulse engine , new shapes for the aft end and hangar doors of the secondary hull , more docking ports , rounder windows , hatches , and windows for an observation lounge , recreation deck , and arboretum . Probert also replaced the Phase II ship weapons tube with a twin launcher torpedo deck and added elements such as features for a separating saucer and landing pads that were never utilized on any film featuring the model . 
 Most of the models in The Motion Picture were created by Magicam , a Paramount subsidiary . The main Enterprise model was eight feet long , to a scale of 1 / 120th scale size , or 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) to 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . It took 14 months and $ 150 @,@ 000 to build . Instead of standard fiberglass used for older models , the new Enterprise was constructed with lightweight plastics , weighing 85 pounds ( 39 kg ) . The biggest design issue was making sure that the connective dorsal neck and twin warp nacelle struts were strong enough so that no part of the ship model would sag , bend , or quiver when the model was being moved , which was accomplished via an arc @-@ welded aluminum skeleton . The completed model could be supported at one of five possible points as each photographic angle required . A second , 20 @-@ inch ( 50 @.@ 8 cm ) model of the ship was used for long shots . While the hull surface was kept smooth , it was treated with a special paint finish that made its surface appear iridescent in certain light . <unk> of the film 's sets were inserted behind some windows , and as jokes , some featured Probert , other production staff members , and Mickey Mouse . The Enterprise was revised again after Abel & Associates were dismissed . 
 Magicam also produced the orbital dry dock seen during the Enterprise 's first appearance in the film . Measuring 4 ft x 10 ft x 6 ft ( <unk> x <unk> x <unk> ) , its 56 neon panels required 168 @,@ 000 volts of electricity to operate , with a separate table to support the transformers ; the final price for the dock setup was $ 200 @,@ 000 . 
 The creation of V 'Ger caused problems for the entire production . The crew was dissatisfied with the original four @-@ foot clay model created by the Abel group , which looked like a modernized Nemo 's Nautilus submarine . Industrial designer Syd Mead was hired to visualize a new version of the mammoth craft . Mead created a machine that contained organic elements based on input from Wise , Roddenberry , and the effects leads . The final model was 68 feet ( 21 m ) long , built from the rear forward so that the camera crews could shoot footage while the next sections were still being fabricated . The model was built out of a plethora of materials — wood , foam , <unk> , Styrofoam cups , incandescent , neon and strobe lights . 
 Dick Rubin handled the film 's props , and set up a makeshift office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production . Rubin 's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands . As such , Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film , 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone . Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series , such as phasers and handheld communicators . The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura 's wireless earpiece , which Nichols specifically requested on the first day of shooting ( and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about ) . The new phaser was entirely self @-@ contained , with its own circuitry , batteries , and four blinking lights . The prop came with a hefty $ 4000 price tag ; to save money , the lights were dropped , reducing the size of the phaser by a third . A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film . The communicators were radically altered , as by the 1970s the micro @-@ miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable . A wrist @-@ based design was decided upon , with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous . Two hundred communicators were fashioned , but only a few were the $ 3500 top models , used for close @-@ ups of the device in action . Most of the props were made from plastic , as Rubin thought that in the future man @-@ made materials would be used almost exclusively . 
 = = = Costumes and makeup = = = 
 Roddenberry firmly believed that throwaway clothes were the future of the industry , and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture . William Ware Theiss , the designer who created the original television series costumes , was too busy to work on the film . Instead Robert Fletcher , considered one of American theater 's most successful costume and scenic designers , was selected to design the new uniforms , suits , and robes for the production . Fletcher eschewed man @-@ made synthetics for natural materials , finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted longer . As times had changed , the Starfleet uniforms , with their bright reds , blues , greens , and golds , had to be revised : the miniskirts worn by females on the show seemed exciting in the 1960s but would now be considered sexist . Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish , and Fletcher believed that the brightness of these old designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen — the designer 's first task was to create new , less conspicuous uniforms . 
 In the original series , divisions in ship assignments were denoted by shirt color ; for the movie , these color codes were moved to small patches on each person 's uniform . The Starfleet delta symbol , which previously indicated duty branches — command , science , medical , engineering , and so forth — was replaced with the command symbol for all branches , superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service . The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded , for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects . Three types of uniforms were fabricated : dress uniforms used for special occasions , Class A uniforms for regular duty , and Class B uniforms as an alternative . The Class A designs were double @-@ stitched in gabardine and featured gold braid designating rank . It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain 's rank was too blatantly militaristic . Povill had to send out a memo to Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system , as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused . Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T @-@ shirts , with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions . Each costume had the shoes built into the pant leg to further the futuristic look . An Italian shoemaker decorated by the Italian government for making Gucci shoes was tasked with creating the futuristic footwear . Combining the shoes and trousers was difficult , time @-@ consuming , and expensive , as each shoe had to be sewn by hand after being fitted to each principal actor . There were difficulties in communication , as the shoemaker spoke limited English and occasionally confused shoe orders due to similar @-@ sounding names . <unk> , serving a more utilitarian function , were the only costumes to have pockets , and were made with a heavyweight spandex that required a special needle to puncture the thick material . A variety of field jackets , leisure wear , and spacesuits were also created ; as these parts had to be designed and completed before most of the actors ' parts had been cast , many roles were filled by considering how well the actors would fit into existing costumes . 
 For the civilians of San Francisco , Fletcher decided on a greater freedom in dress . Much of the materials for these casual clothes were found in the old storerooms at Paramount , where a large amount of unused or forgotten silks , <unk> , and leathers lay in storage . One bolt of material had been handpicked by Cecil DeMille in 1939 , and was in perfect condition . The red , black , and gold brocade was woven with real gold and silver wrapped around silk thread ; the resulting costume was used for a <unk> ambassador and , at a price of $ 10 @,@ 000 for the fabric alone , was the most expensive costume ever worn by a Hollywood extra . Fletcher also recycled <unk> from The Ten Commandments for the <unk> costumes . With the approval of Roddenberry , Fletcher fashioned complete backgrounds for the alien races seen in the Earth and recreation deck sequences , describing their appearances and the composition of their costumes . 
 Fred Phillips , the original designer of Spock 's Vulcan ears , served as The Motion Picture 's makeup artist . He and his staff were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film . The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher 's sketches . In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture . Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer , then baked for six hours . Though Phillips had saved the original television series casts used for making the appliances , Nimoy 's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated . While on the small screen the ears could be used up to four times , since nicks and tears did not show up on television , Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming . The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail , and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming — twice as long as it had for television . 
 Besides developing Vulcan ears and alien masks , Phillips and his assistant Charles Schram applied more routine makeup to the principal actors . Khambatta 's head had to be freshly shaved each day , then given an application of makeup to reduce glare from the hot set lights . Khambatta had no qualms about shaving her head at first , but began worrying if her hair would grow back properly . Roddenberry proposed insuring Khambatta 's hair after the actress voiced her concerns , believing the price of such insurance to be negligible . Roddenberry also saw other benefits to taking out a policy : 
 ... Second , [ the insurance ] would have the advantage of reassuring [ Khambatta ] and making her feel more comfortable during her role . Third and finally , if the price does turn out to be negligible , John Rothwell , our publicist , assures me that we would probably get many times the cost back in publicity about the insurance . 
 The idea was ultimately scrapped , as it turned out such a guarantee would be highly expensive ; the insurance company believed that there would be difficulty in proving that the hair grew back exactly the same as before . Instead , Khambatta visited the Georgette Klinger Skin Care Salon in Beverly Hills , where experts recommended that she receive six facials and scalp treatments during the course of production . The salon also prescribed a daily scalp treatment routine of cleansing bars , <unk> lotion , conditioner , makeup remover , and cleansing lotion . The studio agreed these measures were necessary and footed the bill while Khambatta spent six months following the tedious instructions ( her hair eventually regrew without issue , though she kept her shaven locks after production had ended . ) 
 = = = Technical consulting = = = 
 In the decade between the end of the Star Trek television series and the film , many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show — electronic doors that open automatically , hypodermic injections , talking computers , weapons that stun rather than kill , and personal communication devices — had become a reality . Roddenberry had insisted that the technology aboard the Enterprise be grounded in established science and scientific theories . The Motion Picture likewise received technical consultation from NASA , the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology , and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov . 
 The greatest amount of technical advice for the production came from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , who provided Trek fan <unk> von Puttkamer as advisor to the film . Roddenberry had known Puttkamer since 1975 , when they had been introduced by a mutual friend , the Assistant Director of Astronautics at the Smithsonian Institution . From 1976 until the completion of the film Puttkamer provided the writers , producer , and director with memos on everything technical in the script ; the scientist reviewed every line in the script , and was unpaid for his assistance . " Science fiction films , including those of the recent past , have been woefully short of good science advice , " he said . " Star Wars [ is ] really not science fiction . I loved it , but it 's a fairy tale of princes and knights in another galaxy . The technology was improbable , the science impossible . " 
 During the rewrite of the final scenes , the studio executives clashed with Roddenberry about the script 's ending , believing that the concept of a living machine was too far @-@ fetched . The executives consulted Asimov : if the writer decided a sentient machine was plausible , the ending could stay . Asimov loved the ending , but made one small suggestion ; he felt that the use of the word " wormhole " was incorrect , and that the anomaly that the Enterprise found itself in would be more accurately called a " temporal tunnel " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming of The Motion Picture 's first scene began on August 7 , 1978 . A few ad @-@ libbed ceremonies were performed before the cameras rolled ; Roddenberry gave Wise his baseball cap , emblazoned with " Enterprise " in gold lettering ( the cap was a gift from the captain of the nuclear carrier Enterprise . ) Wise and Roddenberry then cracked a special breakaway bottle of champagne on the bridge set ( there was no liquid inside , as flying champagne would have damaged the readied set . ) The scene planned was the chaotic mess aboard the Enterprise bridge as the crew readies the ship for space travel ; Wise directed 15 takes into the late afternoon before he was content with the scene . The first day 's shots used 1 @,@ 650 feet ( 500 m ) of film ; 420 feet ( 130 m ) were considered " good " , 1 @,@ 070 feet ( 330 m ) were judged " no good " , and 160 feet ( 49 m ) were wasted ; only one and one @-@ eighth pages had been shot . 
 Alex Weldon was hired to be supervisor of special effects for the film . Weldon was planning on retiring after 42 years of effects work , but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought he did not have enough to do . When Weldon was hired , many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg ; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher @-@ budgeted effects for the motion picture . The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number , duration , and type of effects . Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items , he and the other members of the special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner . 
 Richard H. Kline served as the film 's cinematographer . Working from sketch artist Maurice <unk> 's concepts , Wise would judge if they were on the right track . Kline and Michelson would then discuss the look they wanted ( along with Weldon , if effects were involved . ) Each sequence was then storyboarded and left to Kline to execute . The cinematographer called his function to " interpret [ the ] <unk> and make it indelible on film . It 's a way of everybody being on the same wavelength . " Kline would recall that there was not a single " easy " shot to produce for the picture , as each scene required special consideration . The bridge , for example , was lit with a low density of light to make the console monitors display better . It was hard to frame shots so that reflections of the crew in monitors or light spilling through floor grilles were not seen in the final print . 
 While Kline was concerned with lighting , print quality , and color , Bonnie Prendergast , the script supervisor , took notes that would be written up after the company had finished for the day . Prendergast 's role was to ensure continuity in wardrobe , actor position , and prop placement . Any changes in dialogue or ad @-@ libbed lines were similarly written down . Assistant director Danny McCauley was responsible for collaborating with unit production manager Phil Rawlins to finalize shooting orders and assigning extras . Rawlins , McCauley , production manager Lindsley Parsons Jr . , and Katzenberg were all tasked with keeping things moving as fast as possible and keeping the budget under control ; every hour on stage cost the production $ 4000 . 
 The production was for most of the filming a closed set , with great measures taken to maintain the secrecy of the plot . Scripts were numbered and lists kept of who received each copy . The press was told nothing about the story and only a few production stills were allowed to be published . During construction one young visitor to a soundstage stole a copy of blueprints for the bridge set and sold duplicates of them to any fans who would pay him $ 75 ; Paramount reported the matter to the FBI , who turned the case over to the Los Angeles Police Department . The police arrested , convicted , and fined the culprit $ 750 ; it was later discovered that the stolen plans were not the final copies . Visitor 's badges were created to keep track of guests , and due to the limited number were constantly checked out ; among the visitors included friends of the cast and crew , the press , fan leaders , and actors such as Clint Eastwood , Tony Curtis , Robin Williams , and Mel Brooks . Security swept cars leaving the lots for stolen items ; even the principal actors were not spared from this inconvenience . 
 By August 9 , the production was already a full day behind schedule . Despite the delays , Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set , feeling he lost his edge afterwards . The director was patient on set ; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper , but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool . Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors , especially Shatner , to help ensure that dialog and characterizations were consistent with the show . While the bridge scenes were shot early , trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work . Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests . Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays . The footage for the scene was filmed two ways ; first , at the standard 24 frames per second , and then at the faster 48 frames ; the normal footage was a back @-@ up if the slow @-@ motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned . The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole @-@ related puns . The scene was finally completed on August 24 , while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage . 
 The planet Vulcan setting was created using a mixture of on @-@ location photography at Minerva Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park and set recreation . Yellowstone was selected after filming in Turkish ruins proved to be too expensive . Securing permission for filming the scenes was difficult in the middle of the summer tourist season , but the Parks Department acquiesced so long as the crew remained on the boardwalks to prevent damage to geological formations . <unk> , who had helped select the site for the shoot , traveled to Yellowstone and returned with a number of photos . Minor also made a trip and returned to create a large painting depicting how the scene might look . In consultations with Michelson , the crew decided to use miniatures in the foreground to create the Vulcan temples , combined with the real hot springs in the background . In the film , the bottom third of the frames were composed of miniature stairs , rocks , bits of red glass and a Vulcan statue . The center of the frame contained Nimoy 's shots and the park setting , while the final third of the frame was filled with a matte painting . On August 8 , the day after production began at Paramount , an eleven @-@ person second unit left for Yellowstone . The sequence took three days to shoot . 
 On returning to Paramount , the art department had to recreate parts of Yellowstone in a large " B tank " , 110 by 150 feet ( 34 by 46 m ) long . The tank was designed to be flooded with millions of gallons of water to represent large bodies of water . Minor set up miniatures on the tank 's floor before construction and made sure that the shadows that fell on Spock at Yellowstone could be properly recreated . A plywood base was built on metal platforms to create stone silhouettes , reinforced with chicken wire . Polyurethane foam was sprayed over the framework under the supervision of the Los Angeles Fire Department . The bottom part of the statue miniature was represented by a 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) high fiberglass foot . Weldon matched the effects filmed at Yellowstone using dry ice and steam machines . To recreate the appearance of the swirling eddies of water in the real Yellowstone , a combination of evaporated milk , white poster paint , and water was poured into the set 's pools . The pressure of the steam channeled into the pools through hidden tubing causes enough movement in the whirlpools to duplicate the location footage . Due to the requirement that the sun be in a specific location for filming and that the environment be bright enough , production fell behind schedule when it was unseasonably cloudy for three days straight . Any further scenes to recreate Vulcan would be impossible , as the set was immediately torn down to serve as a parking lot for the remainder of the summer . 
 The computer console explosion that causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using <unk> pads . Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire . The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding , causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks ; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare @-@ ups , resulting in additional takes . Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti @-@ gravity throughout the film . These effects were executed by several of Weldon 's assistants . The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track . The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal ; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not show up in the deep blue corridor lighting . Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support . 
 As August ended , production continued to slip farther behind schedule . Koenig learned that rather than being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed , his last day would be on October 26 — eight weeks later than expected . The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence , Enterprise 's approach to V 'Ger and the machine 's resulting attack , were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented , and the engine room scenes could be shot . Chekov 's burns sustained in V 'Ger 's attack were difficult to film ; though the incident took only minutes on film , Weldon spent hours preparing the effect . A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig 's arm , covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve . Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig 's sleeve , causing it to smoke . Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times ; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor , whose arm was slightly burned when some of the solution leaked through to his arm . 
 Khambatta also faced difficulties during filming . Due to the actress ' personal objections , she would not appear nude as called for in the script during the Ilia probe 's appearance . The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin @-@ colored body stocking , but she caught a cold as a result of the shower mist , created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube . Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia . One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay ; doors made out of paper , corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil , and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached . The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe 's throat was a 12 – volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires ; the bulb 's heat eventually caused a slight burn . 
 The last week of production was fraught with issues . Red gel lights appeared orange upon reviewing the daily footage ; the lights were faulty , and three people were nearly electrocuted . On January 26 , 1979 , the film finally wrapped after 125 days . The three leads ( Shatner , Nimoy , and Kelley ) delivered their final lines at 4 : 50 pm . Before the crew could go home , a final shot had to be filmed — the climactic fusing of Decker and V 'Ger . The script prescribed a heavy emphasis on lighting , with spiraling and blinding white lights . Collins was covered in tiny dabs of cotton glued to his jacket ; these highlights were designed to create a body halo . Helicopter lights , 4000 – watt lamps and wind machines were used to create the effect of Decker 's fusion with the living machine . The first attempts at filming the scene became a nightmare for the crew . The extreme lighting caused normally invisible dust particles in the air to be illuminated , creating the appearance that the actors were caught in a blizzard . During the retakes throughout the week the crew mopped and dusted the set constantly , and it required later technical work to completely eliminate the dust in the final print . 
 Two weeks later , the entire cast and crew joined with studio executives for a traditional wrap party . Four hundred people attended the gathering , which spilled over into two restaurants in Beverly Hills . While much of the crew readied for post @-@ production , Wise and Roddenberry were grateful for the opportunity to take a short vacation from the motion picture before returning to work . 
 = = = Post @-@ production = = = 
 While the cast departed to work on other projects , the post @-@ production team was tasked with finalizing the film in time for a Christmas release ; the resulting work would take twice as long as the filming process had taken . Editor Todd Ramsay and assistants spent principal photography syncing film and audio tracks . The resulting rough cuts were used to formulate plans for sound effects , music , and optical effects that would be added later . 
 Roddenberry also provided a large amount of input , sending memos to Ramsay via Wise with ideas for editing . Ramsay tried to cut as much unnecessary footage as he could as long as the film 's character and story development were not damaged . One of Roddenberry 's ideas was to have the Vulcans speak their own language . Because the original Vulcan scenes had been photographed with actors speaking English , the " language " needed to lip @-@ sync with the actor 's lines . 
 After the groundbreaking opticals of Star Wars , The Motion Picture 's producers realized the film required similarly high @-@ quality visuals . Douglas Trumbull , a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood who had worked on 2001 : A Space Odyssey , was the first choice for director of special effects , but declined the offer . When approached , Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters , and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to churn out special effects for someone else 's production ; after completing the effects work , Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process . The next choice , John Dykstra , was similarly wrapped up in other projects . Post @-@ production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel 's production company Robert Abel and Associates might be up to the task . The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture . Abel and Associates bid $ 4 million for doing the film 's effects and Paramount accepted . As new effects were added , Abel increased their bid by $ 750 @,@ 000 , and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined . 
 Rumors surfaced about difficulties regarding the special effects . By a year into the production , millions of dollars had been spent , yet almost no usable footage had been created ; Abel and Associates was not experienced in motion picture production and the steep learning curve worried the producers . Due to contract obligations , Trumbull served as a consultant to Abel and Associates , while effects artist Richard Yuricich acted as a liaison between Abel and Paramount . To speed up the work , Abel passed off miniature and matte painting tasks to Yuricich . Despite being relieved of nearly half the effects work , it became clear by early 1979 that Abel and Associates would not be able to complete the remainder on time . Creative differences grew between Abel and Associates and the Paramount production team , and by mid @-@ February 1979 the two companies parted ways . 
 The studio had wasted $ 5 million and a year 's worth of time with Abel and Associates , although Abel reportedly gained a new production studio filled with equipment using Paramount 's money . Trumbull , meanwhile , had completed Close Encounters but his plan for a full feature had been cancelled by Paramount , a move some considered punishment for passing on Star Trek . With Trumbull now available , primary responsibility for The Motion Picture 's optical effects passed on to him . In March the studio offered Trumbull virtual carte blanche if he could get the opticals work completed by December , the release date to which Paramount was financially committed ( having accepted advances from exhibitors planning on a Christmas delivery ) . Trumbull was confident that he could get the work done without a loss of quality despite a reputation for missing deadlines because of his perfectionism . Paramount assigned a studio executive to Trumbull to make sure he would meet the release date , and together with Yuricich the effects team rushed to finish . The effects budget climbed to $ 10 million . 
 Yuricich 's previous work had been as Director of Photography for Photographic Effects on Close Encounters , and he and Trumbull reassembled the crew and equipment from the feature , adding more personnel and space . Time , not money , was the main issue ; Trumbull had to deliver in nine months twice the effects as found in Star Wars or Close Encounters , which had taken years to complete . The Glencoe @-@ based facilities the teams had used for Close Encounters were deemed insufficient , and a nearby facility was rented and outfitted with five more stages equipped with camera tracks and systems . Dykstra and his 60 @-@ person production house Apogee Company were subcontracted to Trumbull . 
 Trumbull and Dykstra found the Magicam models problematic . The Klingon cruiser 's lighting was so dim that there was no way to make them bright enough on film . As Trumbull also felt the Enterprise 's lights were ill @-@ suited for his needs , he rewired both models . He questioned that the Enterprise could be traveling years from any source of light and yet still be fully illuminated . Instead of having the ship completely dark save for <unk> , Trumbull came up with a system of self @-@ illumination ; he pictured the ship as something like an <unk> , " a grand lady of the seas at night " . A similar method was used on the Klingon cruiser model , but he made it less well @-@ lit to convey a different look than the clean visuals of the Federation — the cruiser was meant to evoke " an enemy submarine in World War II that 's been out at sea for too long " . The models were filmed in multiple passes and composited together in post @-@ production ; multiple passes with only the model 's lighting running were added to the original pass for the final look . The Klingon cruiser sequence was developed to avoid an opening similar to Star Wars , with one model used for all three seen in the film . 
 While Dykstra 's team handled the ships , the V 'Ger cloud was developed by Trumbull . Trumbull wanted the cloud to have a specific shape to it — " it couldn 't just be a blob of cotton , " he said , " it had to have some shape that you could get camera angles on . " A special camera support track was built that could pan and focus over a 40 by 80 feet ( 12 by 24 m ) piece of art , with the light <unk> to provide depth . While the team planned on compositing multiple passes to provide physical movement to the cloud shots , Trumbull felt that it detracted from the sense of scale , and so small animations were subtly introduced in the final product . The torpedo effects were simulated by shooting a laser through a piece of crystal mounted on a rotating rod after experiments with Tesla coils proved insufficient . The same effect was recolored and used for the Klingons and the Enterprise ; the aliens ' torpedoes glowed red while the " good guys " had blue @-@ colored weaponry . V 'Ger 's destruction of the ships was created using scanning lasers , with the multiple laser passes composited onto the moving model to create the final effect . 
 The scenes of Kirk and Scott approaching the Enterprise in drydock spanned two pages of script but took forty @-@ five different shots — averaging one shot a day — for the travel pod containing Kirk to make its flight from the space office complex to the docking ring . Double shifts around the clock were required to finish the effect on time . For close shots of the pod traveling to the Enterprise , close @-@ ups of Shatner and Doohan were composited into the model , while in long shots lookalike puppets were used . 
 Dykstra and Apogee created three models to stand in for the Epsilon 9 station . A 6 @-@ by @-@ 3 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 8 by 1 @.@ 1 m ) model was used for distance shots , while an isolated 5 @-@ by @-@ 6 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 by 1 @.@ 8 m ) panel was used for closer shots . The station control tower was replicated with rear @-@ projection screens to add the people inside . A 2 ft model spaceman created for the shot was used in the drydock sequence and Spock 's spacewalk . Unique destruction effects for the station had to be discarded due to time constraints . V 'Ger itself was filmed in a hazy , smoky room , in part to convey depth and also to hide the parts of the ship still under construction . The multiple passes were largely based on guesswork , as every single available camera was in use and the effects had to be generated without the aid of a bluescreen . 
 Even after the change in effects companies , Yuricich continued to provide many of the matte paintings used in the film , having previously worked on The Day the Earth Stood Still , Ben @-@ Hur , North by Northwest and Logan 's Run . The paintings were combined with live action after a selected area of the frame was matted out ; the blue Earth sky over Yellowstone , for example was replaced with a red @-@ hued Vulcan landscape . More than 100 such paintings were used . 
 Despite being hired after the completion of nearly all the principal photography , Trumbull had an enormous amount of creative input on the film . The Spock spacewalk sequence , for example , was radically changed from the Abel version . The original plan was for Kirk to follow Spock in a spacesuit and come under attack from a mass of sensor @-@ type organisms . Spock would save his friend , and the two would proceed through V 'ger . Wise , Kline and Abel had been unable to agree on how to photograph the sequence , and the result was a poorly designed and ungainly effect that Trumbull was convinced was disruptive to the plot and would have cost millions to fix . Instead , he recommended a stripped @-@ down sequence that omitted Kirk entirely and would be simple and easy to shoot ; Robert McCall , known for designing the original posters to 2001 : A Space Odyssey , provided Trumbull with concept art to inform the new event .

 The score for Star Trek : The Motion Picture was predominantly written by Jerry Goldsmith , who later composed the scores for The Final Frontier , First Contact , Insurrection , and Nemesis , as well as the themes to the television series The Next Generation ( a simplified arrangement of the theme from Star Trek : The Motion Picture and fronted with Alexander Courage 's " Star Trek Fanfare " intro from The Original Series ) and Voyager . Gene Roddenberry had originally wanted Goldsmith to score Star Trek 's pilot episode , " The Cage " , but the composer was unavailable . When Wise signed on to direct , Paramount asked the director if he had any objection to using Goldsmith . Wise , who had worked with the composer for The Sand Pebbles , replied " Hell , no . He 's great ! " Wise later considered his work with Goldsmith one of the best relationships he ever had with a composer . 
 Goldsmith was influenced by the style of the romantic , sweeping music of Star Wars . " When you stop and think about it , space is a very romantic thought . It is , to me , like the Old West , we ’ re up in the universe . It ’ s about discovery and new life [ ... ] it ’ s really the basic premise of Star Trek , " he said . Goldsmith 's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships . Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece , Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece . Although irked by the rejection , Goldsmith consented to re @-@ work his initial ideas . The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece . The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited , requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue . Star Trek : The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture , using " Ilia 's Theme " ( later re @-@ recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as " A Star Beyond Time " with lyrics by Larry <unk> ) in this role , most noticeably in the " Director 's Edition " DVD release . Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 ( with Lars von Trier 's Dancer in the Dark ) . 
 Much of the recording equipment used to create the movie 's intricately complicated sound effects was , at the time , extremely cutting edge . Among these pieces of equipment was the ADS ( Advanced Digital Synthesizer ) 11 , manufactured by Pasadena , California custom synthesizer manufacturer Con Brio , Inc . The movie provided major publicity and was used to advertise the synthesizer , though no price was given . The film 's soundtrack also provided a debut for the Blaster Beam , an electronic instrument 12 to 15 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 to 4 @.@ 6 m ) long . It was created by musician Craig Huxley , who played a small role in an episode of the original television series . The Blaster had steel wires connected to amplifiers fitted to the main piece of aluminum ; the device was played with an artillery shell . Goldsmith heard it and immediately decided to use it for V 'Ger 's cues . Several state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art synthesizers were used as musical instruments , notably the Yamaha CS @-@ 80 , ARP 2600 , Oberheim OB @-@ X , and Serge synthesizer . An enormous pipe organ first plays the V 'Ger theme on the Enterprise 's approach , a literal indication of the machine 's power . 
 Goldsmith scored The Motion Picture over a period of three to four months , a relatively relaxed schedule compared to typical production , but time pressures resulted in Goldsmith bringing on colleagues to assist in the work . Alexander Courage , composer of the original Star Trek theme , provided arrangements to accompany Kirk 's log entries , while Fred Steiner wrote eleven cues of additional music , notably the music to accompany the Enterprise achieving warp speed and first meeting V 'Ger . The rush to finish the rest of the film impacted the score . The final recording session finished at 2 : 00 am on December 1 , only five days before the film 's release . 
 A soundtrack featuring the film 's music was released by Columbia Records in 1979 together with the film debut , and was one of Goldsmith 's best @-@ selling scores . Sony 's Legacy Recordings released an expanded two @-@ disc edition of the soundtrack on November 10 , 1998 . The album added an additional 21 minutes of music to supplement the original track list , and was resequenced to reflect the story line of the film . The first disc features as much of the score as can fit onto a 78 @-@ minute disc , while the second disc contains " Inside Star Trek " , a spoken word documentary from the 1970s . In 2012 , the score was released yet again via La @-@ La Land Records in association with Sony Music . This 3 @-@ CD set contains the complete score for the first time , plus unreleased alternate and unused cues , in addition to the remastered original 1979 album .
