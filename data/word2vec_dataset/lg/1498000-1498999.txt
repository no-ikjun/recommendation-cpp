 Three major challenges face the design of disruptively patterned uniforms , however . Firstly , units frequently move from one terrain to another , where the background colours and contrasts may differ greatly . A uniform designed for woodland will be too strongly contrasting for desert use , and too green for urban use . Therefore , no single camouflage pattern is effective in all terrains . The American UCP of 2004 attempted to suit all environments but was withdrawn after a few years of service . Terrain specific patterns like " Berlin camouflage " , which was applied to British vehicles operating in Berlin during the Cold War , have sometimes been developed but are ineffective in other terrains . Secondly , the effectiveness of any pattern in disrupting a soldier 's outlines varies with lighting , depending on the weather and the height of the sun in the sky . And thirdly , any given patch of printed colour varies in apparent size with distance from the enemy observing the pattern . A pattern printed with small patches of colour blends into a single perceived mass at a certain range , defeating the disruptive effect . Conversely , a pattern printed with large patches of colour appears conspicuous at shorter ranges . This problem has been solved with pixellated shapes , often designed digitally , that provide a fractal @-@ like range of patch sizes , enabling them to be effectively disruptive both at close range and at a distance . The first genuinely digital camouflage pattern was the Canadian CADPAT , soon followed by the American MARPAT . A pixellated appearance is not essential for this effect , though it is simpler to design and to print .

 = Battle of Saint @-@ Pierre = 
 The Battle of Saint @-@ Pierre was a military confrontation on March 25 , 1776 , near the Quebec village of Saint @-@ Pierre , south of Quebec City . This confrontation , which occurred during the Continental Army 's siege of Quebec following its defeat at the Battle of Quebec , was between forces that were both largely composed of Canadian militia , including individuals on both sides of the conflict that had been recruited in the same communities . The Patriot forces routed the Loyalist forces , killing at least 3 and capturing more than 30 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Early in the American Revolutionary War , the Second Continental Congress had invited the citizens of the Province of Quebec to join them , first by addressing letters to them , and then by invading the province with the goal of ousting the British government of General Guy Carleton . The invasion reached a peak on December 31 , 1775 , when the Continental Army , under the command of General Richard Montgomery , was defeated before the gates of the city of Quebec . The battle resulted in the death of Montgomery and the capture of over 400 men . 
 Following the defeat , the remnants of the Army , now under the command of General Benedict Arnold , besieged the city . During this time , they worked to recruit French @-@ speaking Canadians to support their efforts toward independence , while Carleton and the British worked to build Loyalist support among the Canadiens . 
 = = Loyalist militia recruitment = = 
 Early on the morning of March 14 , 1776 , Jean @-@ Baptiste Chasson , a Canadian miller from Saint @-@ Vallier , crossed the Saint Lawrence River by canoe and reached the city of Quebec . He brought news to General Carleton that the Americans were setting up a gun battery at Pointe @-@ Lévis , on the south shore of the river , across from the city . This battery would command the city 's harbor and shipping on the river . Chasson also told Carleton that people to the south of the city were prepared to rise up against the Americans . 
 Carleton gave Chasson instructions to deliver to Louis Liénard de Beaujeu , the seigneur of the Isle @-@ aux @-@ <unk> ( Crane Island ) , an island in the Saint Lawrence , and a man with previous military experience in the French and Indian War . The instructions included intercepted communications from Arnold describing the difficult conditions in the siege camp and an amnesty for people who had previously supported the Americans but were now willing to assist the British . Beaujeu , who had previously been asked to raise militia in support of the British , set about raising a force to make an attack on the unfinished battery at Pointe @-@ Lévis . By March 23 , he had assembled over 100 men at Sainte @-@ Anne @-@ de @-@ la @-@ <unk> . When this force reached Saint @-@ Thomas on the night of March 24 , it was joined there by an additional 70 men . An advance guard from this force , numbering 46 , was sent to Saint @-@ Pierre under the command of Couillard and Gaspé , where they established a base at the house of Michel <unk> , a Loyalist and former commander of the local militia . 
 = = Americans warned = = 
 Habitants from Beaumont friendly to the Americans notified the commander at Pointe @-@ Lévis of the recruiting activity . In response , General Arnold , sent a detachment of 80 Americans under John Dubois to deal with the situation . Pierre Ayotte and Clément Gosselin , recruiters working for Moses Hazen , the commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment , raised about 150 men who joined the Americans . These forces headed up the southern shore to investigate the reports . Some of these recruits were from the same villages from which Beaujeu had recruited men . A small band of militia from Beaumont went to Saint @-@ Michel and arrested Chasson , who was planning to return to the city . 
 = = Conflict = = 
 The Loyalist advance guard was surprised by the arrival of the Patriot forces at Saint @-@ Pierre , and barricaded themselves in the house , where they were attacked by Dubois ' men with musket and cannon . While a few escaped , the majority surrendered , and three were killed . Their priest , Charles @-@ François Bailly de <unk> , was wounded in this battle . It is said that , because both sides recruited in the same areas to build their militias , that there were some families whose members fought against each other in this battle . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Beaujeu , his plans uncovered , disbanded the militia and went into hiding on Île @-@ aux @-@ <unk> . After Dubois established that the action had been sanctioned by the British , some of the prisoners were released after promising not to take up arms again . The remaining 21 prisoners were sent to the American camp outside Quebec . 
 The skirmish itself had no notable effect on relations between the people and the occupying Americans , which were already deteriorating as the siege dragged on . This was due in part to the fact that the Americans , rather than paying for their supplies in coin , paid with Continental paper currency or promissory notes , deemed to be of little worth by the locals . 
 = Oklahoma State Highway 32 = 
 State Highway 32 ( SH @-@ 32 or OK @-@ 32 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Oklahoma . The highway runs from west to east across the southern part of the state , just north of the Red River . The route begins at US @-@ 81 in Ryan and ends at US @-@ 70 in Kingston , a length of 77 @.@ 3 miles ( 124 @.@ 4 km ) . 
 SH @-@ 32 was first added to the state highway system at the end of 1934 ; none of the highway as created is part of the present @-@ day SH @-@ 32 ( having been encroached upon by US @-@ 70 ) . SH @-@ 32 is also linked with SH @-@ 199 — part of SH @-@ 32 was spun off to create SH @-@ 199 in 1938 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SH @-@ 32 begins at US @-@ 81 in Ryan , where it follows the street grid , heading in a northeast direction . As the route leaves Ryan , it turns onto a due east course . It is 17 miles ( 27 km ) until the next town , Grady . SH @-@ 32 turns to the southeast to serve this town . Six more miles ( 10 km ) from Grady , SH @-@ 32 meets another highway for the first time , SH @-@ 89 . At the junction , SH @-@ 32 turns south , overlapping SH @-@ 89 for six miles ( 10 km ) . While concurrent , the two highways pass through the unincorporated community of Petersburg , then turn to the west . The two routes divide at Courtney , where SH @-@ 89 heads south towards the Red River and Texas . 
 SH @-@ 32 continues east from Courtney , crossing over Mud Creek , then passing through unincorporated <unk> . East of <unk> , the highway comes to the intersection with SH @-@ 76 . The next unincorporated community SH @-@ 32 passes through is Turner . Eight miles ( 13 km ) east of the SH @-@ 76 junction , at Dunbar , SH @-@ 32 serves as the northern terminus of SH @-@ 96 , which serves <unk> . 
 Nine miles ( 14 km ) east of <unk> , SH @-@ 32 has an interchange with I @-@ 35 outside Marietta , the seat of Love County . Soon after passing I @-@ 35 , SH @-@ 32 forms a brief concurrency with US @-@ 77 , and passes through Marietta . East of town , the route comes to a junction with SH @-@ <unk> ( one of SH @-@ <unk> 's four termini ) . SH @-@ 32 continues east , following the curve of Lake Texoma 's shoreline , passing through Lebanon . The highway then intersects with SH @-@ <unk> . 
 Five miles ( 8 km ) east of SH @-@ <unk> , SH @-@ 32 crosses US @-@ 377 / SH @-@ 99 . Two miles ( 3 km ) further east , SH @-@ 32 acts as the southern endpoint of SH @-@ <unk> . Two miles ( 3 km ) after that , SH @-@ 32 ends at US @-@ 70 in Kingston . 
 = = History = = 
 State Highway 32 was commissioned on December 12 , 1934 . As originally created , the route ran from SH @-@ 14 ( present @-@ day US @-@ 183 ) in Davidson to Waurika , passing through the towns of <unk> , Devol , and Randlett and the counties of Tillman , Cotton , and Jefferson . SH @-@ 32 was extended to cover approximately the west half of its present @-@ day route on June 16 , 1936 ; the route 's new eastern terminus was US @-@ 77 in Marietta . On March 29 , 1937 , the highway was expanded even further east to end at US @-@ 70 in <unk> . This extension was split off to form SH @-@ 199 on October 13 , 1938 . 
 Meanwhile , changes were occurring in the eastern part of Jefferson County . The portion of highway from Ryan east to the Love County line was removed from the highway system on December 31 , 1937 . As a result , SH @-@ 32 was discontiguous ; one section stretched from Davidson to Ryan , while another began at a spur ending at the Jefferson – Love county line and continued east from there . The portion of SH @-@ 32 concurrent with US @-@ 81 between Waurika and Ryan , once necessary to connect to the now @-@ decommissioned road , was removed on February 24 , 1938 . Both of these sections of road were reinstated as part of SH @-@ 32 on February 29 , 1944 . 
 Changes in US @-@ 70 's routing in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in the western part of SH @-@ 32 becoming concurrent with the U.S. highway through southwest Oklahoma during the late 1930s . US @-@ 70 as first designated in Oklahoma crossed into the state north of Burkburnett , Texas and intersected SH @-@ 32 in Randlett ; continuing north of SH @-@ 32 , the U.S. highway turned east , running through Walters . In Comanche , US @-@ 70 turned south along US @-@ 81 and followed it until reaching the present @-@ day US @-@ 70 routing in Waurika . Between Randlett and Waurika , SH @-@ 32 provided a much more direct route . On May 6 , 1936 , US @-@ 70 was realigned to follow SH @-@ 32 between these two cities . On March 3 , 1945 , US @-@ 70 was realigned again . This brought the highway into Oklahoma much earlier , crossing the Red River much further west , in effect bypassing Wichita Falls , Texas . As a result of the realignment , US @-@ 70 intersected SH @-@ 32 at its western terminus in Davidson and followed it all the way to Waurika . The westernmost 64 miles ( 103 km ) of SH @-@ 32 ( as measured along the present @-@ day US @-@ 70 alignment ) were concurrent with US @-@ 70 . 
 SH @-@ 32 was resumed its expansion to the east on September 16 , 1946 . On that date , the highway 's eastern terminus was set at its present location at US @-@ 70 in Kingston . Much of this extension reclaimed for SH @-@ 32 the stretch of road lost by the creation of SH @-@ 199 . At this time , SH @-@ 32 was at its zenith ; stretching from Davidson to Kingston , the route covered a total of 152 miles ( 245 km ) along present @-@ day roads . However , the westernmost 64 miles ( 103 km ) of SH @-@ 32 still overlapped US @-@ 70 . 
 On September 6 , 1966 , after over twenty years of <unk> , SH @-@ 32 was truncated to its current western terminus in Ryan . Everything west of Waurika was now solely US @-@ 70 . After the truncation of 1966 , SH @-@ 32 had the same route that it does today .

 = Drexler – Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology = 
 The Drexler – Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology was a public dispute between K. Eric Drexler , the originator of the conceptual basis of molecular nanotechnology , and Richard Smalley , a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for the discovery of the nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene . The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers , which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules . The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler 's conception of molecular nanotechnology , but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible . The two also traded accusations that the other 's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research . 
 The debate was carried out from 2001 to 2003 through a series of published articles and open letters . It began with a 2001 article by Smalley in Scientific American , which was followed by a rebuttal published by Drexler and coworkers later that year , and two open letters by Drexler in early 2003 . The debate was concluded in late 2003 in a " Point – Counterpoint " feature in Chemical & Engineering News in which both parties participated . 
 The debate has been often cited in the history of nanotechnology due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of nanotechnology . It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone , with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work , and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science , causing commentators to go so far as to characterize the tone of the debate as similar to " a pissing match " and " reminiscent of [ a ] Saturday Night Live sketch " . 
 = = The participants = = 
 = = = K. Eric Drexler = = = 
 K. Eric Drexler is generally considered to have written the first scholarly paper on the topic of nanotechnology , and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work . Trained as an engineer , Drexler was inspired by a then @-@ obscure 1959 talk by physicist Richard Feynman called There 's Plenty of Room at the Bottom , which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using top @-@ down engineering methodologies . Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in molecular biology such as recombinant DNA technology . In a 1981 publication in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology , he argued that biological systems such as the ribosome were already capable of building molecules atom @-@ by @-@ atom , and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed . Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology : Engines of Creation in 1986 , which was intended for the public , and the technical work Nanosystems in 1992 . He also co @-@ founded the Foresight Institute , a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology . 
 Drexler 's vision of nanotechnology , now called molecular nanotechnology , is based on the concept of the molecular assembler , a molecular machine which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom @-@ by @-@ atom . Drexler drew a distinction between wet nanotechnology based on biological systems , and " second @-@ generation " dry nanotechnology which would be based on mechanosynthesis , positional control of molecules through principles more related to mechanical engineering . Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology , but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems . 
 = = = Richard Smalley = = = 
 Richard E. Smalley , a chemist at Rice University , was best known as a co @-@ discoverer of the C60 form of carbon known as <unk> in 1985 , along with Harry Kroto , Robert Curl , James Heath , and Sean O 'Brien . <unk> was the first to be discovered of the class of molecules known as fullerenes , which also includes carbon nanotubes . The study and application of fullerenes forms a significant part of the fields of nanomaterials and <unk> , and Smalley , Kroto , and Curl were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery . 
 Smalley had also taken a prominent public policy role in relation to nanotechnology , and was an outspoken advocate for using nanotechnology to develop solutions to the world 's energy and health problems , for example raising the possibility of using nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission , and of developing nanomaterial @-@ based drugs for targeted drug delivery . Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes , having founded Carbon <unk> Inc . , and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology startups . Smalley died of leukemia in October 2005 , after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler .

 = = = Smalley 's Scientific American article = = = 
 Smalley wrote an article , " Of Chemistry , Love , and Nanobots " , for the September 2001 issue of the popular science magazine Scientific American , which was a special issue on the topic of nanotechnology . Smalley opened by comparing a chemical reaction to an intricate dance of atoms : 
 When a boy and a girl fall in love , it is often said that the chemistry between them is good . This common use of the word " chemistry " in human relations comes close to the subtlety of what actually happens in the more mundane coupling of molecules . In a chemical reaction between two ' consenting ' molecules , bonds form between some of the atoms in what is usually a complex dance involving motion in multiple dimensions .... And if the chemistry is really , really good , the molecules that do react will all produce the exact product required . 
 He referenced the idea of a molecular assembler , a nanorobot capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product , posing the question of how long it would take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material . He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one mole of material , but self @-@ replicating assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond . Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely , causing a grey goo scenario , or , referring to Bill Joy 's previous article " Why the future doesn 't need us " , that the nanorobots could develop swarm intelligence and become alive in some sense . 
 Smalley then considered how realistic was the concept of a self @-@ replicating nanorobot . He noted that in a chemical reaction , the chemical bonds are all interconnected and that the placement of each atom is sensitive to the position of all the other atoms in the vicinity . He then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work , and would thus have to have many manipulator arms . This led him to raise two objections to the concept of molecular assembler , which he calls the " fat fingers problem " and the " sticky fingers problem " : 
 Because the fingers of a manipulator arm must themselves be made out of atoms , they have a certain irreducible size . There just isn 't enough room in the nanometer @-@ size reaction region to accommodate all the fingers of all the manipulators necessary to have complete control of the chemistry .... [ Also , ] the atoms of the manipulator hands will adhere to the atom that is being moved . So it will often be impossible to release this minuscule building block in precisely the right spot . Both these problems are fundamental , and neither can be avoided . Self @-@ replicating , mechanical nanobots are simply not possible in our world . 
 Smalley closed the article by returning to the analogy of chemistry as a dance of love , remarking that " you don 't make a girl and a boy fall in love by pushing them together . " 
 = = = Drexler 's response = = = 
 Drexler responded by publishing a rebuttal later in 2001 through the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing , which was co @-@ authored with others including Robert Freitas , J. Storrs Hall , and Ralph Merkle . The authors first discussed the " fat fingers " argument by attacking Smalley 's notion that a chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms , stating that many reactions involve only two reactants , one of which can be immobilized and the other attached to a single " finger " . They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) tips and related technologies could be used as a reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface @-@ bound molecules . They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction . The authors noted that the " sticky fingers " problem is valid in some reactions , but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem . 
 The authors put forth the ribosome as an example of a natural molecular machine ; because the ribosome suffers from neither problem , they must not be fundamental , saying : 
 This ubiquitous biological molecular assembler suffers from neither the “ fat finger ” nor the “ sticky finger ” problem . If , as Smalley argues , both problems are “ fundamental , ” then why would they prevent the development of mechanical assemblers and not biological assemblers ? If the class of molecular structures known as proteins can be synthesized using positional techniques , then why would we expect there to be no other classes of molecular structures that can be synthesized using positional techniques ? 
 The authors also questioned Smalley 's figures for the replication time of nanomachines . Instead of Smalley 's figure of 1 GHz for the atomic placement frequency , they point out that Nanosystems suggested a frequency of 1 MHz , a thousand times slower , and that at Smalley 's higher frequency <unk> nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds . The authors called this a straw man argument , writing that " in a serious scientific discussion , a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in the literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of the proposal . " The authors closed by stating that the best way to find out whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work , and that " there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome , but thus far , there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible . " 
 Drexler followed up with two open letters to Smalley in April and July 2003 . The April letter began , " I have written this open letter to correct your public misrepresentation of my work . " Drexler accused Smalley of continuing to dismiss his work by publicly describing molecular assemblers as requiring what Drexler now calls " Smalley fingers " , which he stated to be unlike the enzyme @-@ like systems he had actually proposed . He asserted : 
 The impossibility of " Smalley fingers " has raised no concern in the research community because these fingers solve no problems and thus appear in no proposals . Your reliance on this straw @-@ man attack might lead a thoughtful observer to suspect that no one has identified a valid criticism of my work . For this I should , perhaps , thank you . 
 Drexler compared the nanotechnology debate 's importance to that of discussions of spaceflight before Sputnik or to theoretical work on nuclear chemistry before the Manhattan Project . He disputed Smalley 's arguments that the fear of a grey goo scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research , arguing that the potential for long @-@ term risks made research even more important . His conclusion stated , " your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long @-@ term security concerns . " 
 The July 2003 letter referenced a note from Smalley promising to respond , which had yet gone unfulfilled . Drexler mentions inconsistencies in Smalley 's previous public statements on atom @-@ by @-@ atom construction , and ended by stating " I would not ordinarily raise an issue so persistently , but the question of what nanotechnology can ultimately achieve is perhaps the most fundamental issue in the field today — it shapes basic objectives and expectations — and your words have been remarkably effective in changing how this issue is perceived . " 
 = = = Exchange of letters in Chemical & Engineering News = = = 
 The debate was concluded in a " Point – Counterpoint " feature that was the 1 December 2003 cover story of Chemical & Engineering News , the newsmagazine of the American Chemical Society . The feature first reproduced Drexler 's April 2003 open letter to Smalley . Smalley 's response began by apologizing for any offense his September 2001 article had caused , and stating that Drexler 's book Engines of Creation had triggered Smalley 's own interest in nanotechnology . He agreed that " Smalley fingers " could not work , and then asserted that the same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude the manipulation of larger building blocks , since each molecule would have multiple atoms which would need to be controlled 
 He then agreed that something like an enzyme or ribosome would be capable of precise chemistry , but asked how the nanorobot would be able to obtain , control , and repair such an enzyme , and noted the incompatibility of many reactions with water @-@ based biological systems , stating that " biology is wonderous in the vast diversity of what it can build , but it can 't make a crystal of silicon , or steel , or copper , or aluminum , or titanium , or virtually any of the key materials on which modern technology is built . " Smalley asked what kind of " nonaqueous <unk> chemistry " Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon , calling this " a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries . " 
 Drexler 's <unk> began by returning to Feynman 's 1959 talk , stating that " although inspired by biology ... Feynman 's vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical , not biological . " He characterized the challenges as being that of systems engineering rather than solely chemistry , and referred Smalley to Nanosystems , with its vision of mechanical control of chemical reactions with no enzymes and no reliance on solvents or thermal motion . He stated : 
 Positional control naturally avoids most side reactions by preventing unwanted encounters between potential reactants . Transition @-@ state theory indicates that , for suitably chosen reactants , positional control will enable synthetic steps at megahertz frequencies with the reliability of digital switching operations in a computer . The supporting analysis for this conclusion appears in " Nanosystems " and has withstood a decade of scientific scrutiny . 
 Drexler reiterated that these molecular assemblers would require no impossible fingers , and would augment solution @-@ phase chemistry to produce macroscopic products with precise arrangements of chemical building blocks , using solution @-@ phase molecular assemblers to bootstrap the construction of more sophisticated assemblers . He concluded by writing : 
 U.S. progress in molecular manufacturing has been impeded by the dangerous illusion that it is infeasible . I hope you will agree that the actual physical principles of molecular manufacturing are sound and quite unlike the various notions , many widespread in the press , that you have correctly rejected . I invite you to join me and others in the call to augment today 's nanoscale research with a systems engineering effort aimed at achieving the grand vision articulated by Richard Feynman . 
 Smalley began his concluding letter : 
 I see you have now walked out of the room where I had led you to talk about real chemistry , and you are now back in your mechanical world . I am sorry we have ended up like this . For a moment I thought we were making progress . You still do not appear to understand the impact of my short piece in Scientific American . Much like you can 't make a boy and a girl fall in love with each other simply by pushing them together , you cannot make precise chemistry occur as desired between two molecular objects with simple mechanical motion along a few degrees of freedom in the assembler @-@ fixed frame of reference . Chemistry , like love , is more subtle than that . 
 Smalley stated his belief that most reactions using mechanosynthesis would simply give the wrong product , and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach . He asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme @-@ like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium , and as all known enzymes use water as that medium , the range of products must be limited to the " meat and bone of biology . " He accused Drexler of creating " a pretend world where atoms go where you want because your computer program directs them to go there . " 
 Lastly , Smalley recounted his recent experience reading essays written by middle and high school students after an outreach visit , saying that nearly half of them thought that self @-@ replicating nanorobots were possible and that most were worried about the results of them spreading across the world . Smalley called this a deeply troubling bedside story that he did his best to allay . Smalley concluded his letter : 
 You and people around you have scared our children . I don 't expect you to stop , but I hope others in the chemical community will join with me in turning on the light , and showing our children that , while our future in the real world will be challenging and there are real risks , there will be no such monster as the self @-@ replicating mechanical nanobot of your dreams .

 The debate has been widely criticized for its adversarial tone . David Berube in Nano @-@ Hype : The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz characterized it as " two people talking over each other ... not conducive to reasonable rebuttal , " and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard <unk> as saying " the tenor of the debate is about personal pride , reputation , and a place in the pantheon . " Zyvex founder James von Ehr remarked that " Eric [ Drexler ] didn 't do himself any favors by getting into a pissing match with a Nobel @-@ prize winner . " An article in The New York Times called the debate " reminiscent of that old Saturday Night Live sketch ... [ with ] Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue , " referring to a version of the long @-@ running Weekend Update segment . 
 = = = Technical commentary = = = 
 The debate has received technical criticism as well . Steven A. Edwards in The <unk> Pioneers noted that the ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes an evaluation of the argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications . He remarked that " nowhere in it does Nanosystems contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler ... We are told , for instance , that a manipulator arm would involve 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 atoms , but we are not told which atoms , or how they would be put together . " He concludes that " the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants , but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most <unk> . " 
 On the other hand , futurist Ray Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Near declared Drexler as the winner of the debate , reiterating the view that Smalley distorted Drexler 's ideas and calling Smalley 's responses " short on specific citations and current research and long on imprecise metaphors " and asserting that " Smalley is ignoring the past decade of research on alternative means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided molecular reactions ... [ which have ] been extensively studied . " He quoted experimental results on enzyme function in nonaqueous solutions , and pointed out that modern non @-@ biological technology such as airplanes and computers have exceeded the capabilities of natural biological systems . He also noted that " earlier critics also expressed skepticism that either worldwide communication networks or software viruses that would spread across them were feasible ... [ but today ] we are obtaining far more gain than harm from this latest example of intertwined promise and peril . "

 The debate 's focus on the public perception of nanotechnology has also received commentary . Political blogger Glenn Reynolds stated that " the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too , well , spooky — and worse , that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market . " Lawrence Lessig criticized the scientific establishment , represented by Smalley , for arguing that " if so @-@ called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci @-@ fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day , then serious work can continue , supported by billion @-@ dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries , for example , stem cell research . " Kurzweil wrote that Smalley 's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology . 
 = 1891 – 92 Sheffield United F.C. season = 
 The 1891 – 92 season was the third in existence for Sheffield United . This was their first season playing in the recently formed Northern League as the club sought to establish itself as a major footballing force . The Blades had a reasonably successful season , finishing third in the league , and registering some comprehensive victories along the way . They improved on the previous season by reaching the second round proper of the FA Cup and were victorious in the local cup competitions , winning both the Sheffield Challenge Cup and the Wharncliffe Charity Cup for the first time . 
 Under the stewardship of Joseph Wostinholm , United continued to recruit more experienced players . Bob Cain was signed from Bootle and Harry Hammond arrived from Everton , both players cementing their place in United 's first team for several years to come . Most significant however was the emergence of a young Ernest Needham who made his United debut in the early part of the season and would go on to be one of the club 's greatest ever players and ultimately captain England . The season did see the first United players to gain international caps with both Harry Lilley and Michael Whitham appearing for England on 5 March , ( although in different matches as England played two different games concurrently on that day . )

Previously both sides had provided an umpire who jointly officiated the game and consulted with a third official should they be unable to agree . Penalty kicks were also introduced to penalise fouls made within eighteen yards of the goal , and United used nets in the goals at Bramall Lane for the first time . 
 The previous season had been a mixed one , with an improvement in the quality of players and increasing attendances for home games , but a mid – table finish in the Midland Counties League had been the result . Under the guidance of club secretary J.B. Wostinholm , the football committee still wanted to improve the standard of matches played by United and so opted to leave the Midland Counties League and seek election to The Football League instead . They were unsuccessful in their attempt , amidst accusations that local rivals The Wednesday had voted against their acceptance and had even petitioned other clubs to vote against their entry . Instead United joined the newly formed Northern League which comprised mainly teams from the north – east , meaning that their nearest away match in the league was at Darlington , some 85 miles away from Sheffield . 
 Despite now being focussed on league football , the club also arranged a large number of friendly fixtures throughout the season which resulted in a congested fixture list and United playing 75 first team games in the space of eight months . This season also saw the introduction of an official reserve side for United , dubbed The Sheffield Strollers , who played a number of fixtures in addition to those played by the first team . 
 = = Kit = = 
 United dropped the thin red vertical stripes that had been introduced the previous season , reverting to a plain white shirt along with blue shorts and socks . This season saw the introduction of a club crest ( or badge ) on the shirts for the first time , utilising a red heraldic shield emblazoned with three sheaves of wheat and a lions head , along with the letters <unk> .

 = = = Northern League = = = 
 United continued with a sizable turnover of playing staff but were now focusing on using their financial position to target experienced professionals rather than relying on the untied talents of previous seasons . Bob Cain and Harry Hammond arrived in August , recruited from Bootle and Everton respectively , while previous stalwarts like Edward Cross , Billy Bridgewater and W. Robertson were allowed to leave . A young Ernest Needham was promoted to the first team and began to feature regularly as the season progressed ; he would eventually go on to make over 450 league appearances for the Blades and to captain England during his career . 
 The league season started well as United registered a 4 – 2 away victory over Sunderland Albion followed by two comprehensive home wins ; beating Darlington 7 – 1 and South Bank 6 – 0 . It was not until early November that the Blades dropped points , suffering a 3 – 0 home defeat by Middlesbrough before a 2 – 0 reverse at the hands of struggling Darlington . 
 United continued to add to the squad , signing keeper Will Lilley from Staveley , before registering a string of victories until the end of the year , culminating in a 6 – 0 win over Stockton at the end of December . The league then took a winter break of almost three months , not resuming until almost the end of March . The club continued to strengthen their attacking options by recruiting three additional forwards from Scotland ; Sandy Wallace , John Scott and resigning former player James Duncan . William Calder and Harry Munro were both allowed to join Gainsborough Trinity , before United resumed their league campaign with a 4 – 3 loss away at Newcastle West End who were struggling at the bottom of the table . This signalled a down – turn in form and inconsistent results until the end of the season meant that United lost touch with the top of the table and eventually finished third . 
 United 's growing reputation was such that their players were beginning to come to the attention of the FA and both Michael Whitham and Harry Lilley received an England call – up in March 1892 . Both players made their debut on 5 March , Whitham in a Home Championship game against Ireland in Belfast , and Lilley in a friendly against Wales . 
 The club 's organising football committee were still determined to gain entry to The Football League and applied for election for the second year in succession . On this occasion however United were successful and were given entry into the newly formed Second Division for the 1892 – 93 season . Cross – town rivals The Wednesday had also been accepted into the Football League , but had been placed in the First Division , much to the annoyance of United 's board of directors . United asked to review the ballot papers upon which this decision had been based but were told that they had been destroyed , angering the club 's directors still further . 
 = = = FA Cup = = = 
 As in previous years United had to play a number of qualifying rounds against local opposition before they gained entry to the FA Cup proper . Lincoln City were dispatched 4 – 1 at Bramall Lane , before much closer games against Grimsby and Gainsborough <unk> saw the Blades reach the first round proper . United travelled to Blackpool in the First Round , coming away comfortable 3 – 0 winners to secure a place in Round Two for only the second time . They met an experienced Wolverhampton Wanderers side at Molineux Stadium but were to progress no further , losing 3 – 1 to their Midlands opponents . 
 = = = Local cups = = = 
 As football in the area developed , so the standing of the local cups diminished amongst the area 's leading sides . United entered the Sheffield Challenge Cup at the third round stage and comfortably saw off Doncaster Rovers 4 – 0 at Bramall Lane . The semi @-@ final saw an away trip to Kilnhurst , who the Blades beat by the same 4 – 0 scoreline to secure a place in the final for the second year in succession . United faced local rivals The Wednesday at Bramall Lane , but the opposition had fielded their reserve side during the competition and as such a largely second – string United side beat the Wednesday Wanderers 2 – 1 to lift the club 's first ever trophy . 
 The Wharncliffe Charity Cup garnered even less attention this season and United were given an automatic place in the final where they faced Attercliffe at the Olive Grove ground , beating them 2 – 0 at the end of March to win their second trophy in a month . 
 = = = Friendlies = = = 
 As in the previous two seasons , the football committee filled the fixture list by arranging a large number of friendlies and exhibition games throughout the year . The results of these games were mixed and mirrored the team 's performance in the league ; starting promisingly in the Autumn but tailing off after the turn of the year . United began the programme well , gaining victories against emerging Woolwich Arsenal , and the established Notts County and Bolton Wanderers , in the early part of the season . From October onwards the results became less consistent with the Blades suffering heavy defeats at the hands of Grimsby Town and Birmingham St. George 's . It wasn 't until February that United 's form improved , beating Burnley and Everton twice in consecutive games , running out 5 – 0 victors over the Merseyside club at Bramall Lane . Another run of poor results followed until the Blades registered their most comprehensive victory of the season at the end of March , beating Burnley 8 – 1 . 
 For the second season in succession the highlights of the fixture list were the games against local rivals The Wednesday , with a record 22 @,@ 900 supporters attending Bramall Lane to see the Blades record a 5 – 0 victory at the end of October . Just under a month later United lost the return fixture at Olive Grove 4 – 1 in front of a more modest crowd of just under 12 @,@ 000 .

 = An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory = 
 An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory is a 2010 textbook by the British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane . It is the first book in publisher Palgrave Macmillan 's Animal Ethics Series , edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn . Cochrane 's book examines five schools of political theory — utilitarianism , liberalism , communitarianism , Marxism and feminism — and their respective relationships with questions concerning animal rights and the political status of ( non @-@ human ) animals . Cochrane concludes that each tradition has something to offer to these issues , but ultimately presents his own account of interest @-@ based animal rights as preferable to any . His account , though drawing from all examined traditions , builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism . 
 An Introduction was reviewed positively in several academic publications . Political philosopher Steve Cooke said Cochrane 's own approach showed promise , and that the book would have benefited from devoting more space to it . Robert Garner praised Cochrane 's synthesis of such a broad range of literature , but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of justice as it might apply to animals . Cochrane 's account of interest @-@ based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation , published by Columbia University Press . An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory was one of the first books to explore animals from a political @-@ theory perspective , becoming an established part of a literature critical of the topic 's traditional neglect . 
 = = Background and publication = = 
 In the 1990s and 2000s , Alasdair Cochrane studied politics at the University of Sheffield and the London School of Economics ( LSE ) . His doctoral thesis , supervised by Cécile Fabre with Paul Kelly acting as an adviser , was entitled Moral obligations to non @-@ humans . He subsequently became a fellow and lecturer at the LSE . During this time , Cochrane published articles in Res Publica , Utilitas and Political Studies presenting aspects of his interest @-@ based theory of animal rights , which is defended in the final chapter of An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory . The book was Cochrane 's first , and the political theorist Robert Garner acted as an important <unk> during the writing process . 
 An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory was first published in the UK on 13 October 2010 by Palgrave Macmillan in paperback , hardback and eBook formats . It was the first book to appear as part of the Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series , a partnership between Palgrave Macmillan and the Ferrata Mora Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics . The series 's general editors are Andrew Linzey and Priscilla N. Cohn . Interdisciplinary in focus , the Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series aims to explore the practical and conceptual challenges posed by animal ethics . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory begins by discussing the history of animals in political theory before considering the approaches taken to the status of animals by five schools of political theory : utilitarianism , liberalism , communitarianism , Marxism and feminism . The final chapter outlines Cochrane 's own approach , which he situates between liberalism and utilitarianism . 
 Opening chapters 
 After introducing the purpose of the book , establishing it as a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals should be included in the domain of justice , Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals . He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice , in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded , and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement . 
 Utilitarianism 
 Chapter three considers utilitarianism . Utilitarianism , Cochrane argues , posed a challenge to the medieval and early modern assumption that animals are owed nothing . Its focus on welfare and sentience , and its egalitarian nature , allow the extension of justice to animals . The ideas of Peter Singer are outlined . Cochrane then defends Singer 's account both against those presenting arguments in defence of speciesism , and against critics ( such as R. G. Frey ) who maintain that animals do not have interests . He then considers utilitarian critics of Singer , who argue that meat @-@ eating maximises utility , even when animal interests are taken into account . This leads to the criticism that judging the best consequences is an extremely difficult task for political communities , but Cochrane concludes that a utilitarian consensus does support the abolition of factory farming , regardless of the alternative . Finally , he addresses critics who argue that Singer 's position offers insufficient protection for animals . Nussbaum 's argument that animals can suffer <unk> harms is considered , as is Tom Regan 's criticism that , under Singer 's account , animals are protected only insofar as their protection maximises welfare , rather than in their own right . 
 Liberalism 
 Chapter four considers liberalism . Cochrane focuses primarily upon John Rawls , whose social contract account offers two reasons for the rejection of animals from issues of basic justice : questions of reciprocity , for which animals are ill @-@ suited , and questions of personhood , as all parties to the contract must be moral persons . Cochrane criticises Rawls 's exclusion of animals , before identifying the risks to animals inherent within liberal pluralism . The possibility of a <unk> account including animals , such as those offered by Donald <unk> and Mark Rowlands , is considered and rejected ; Cochrane outlines problems with placing questions of species membership behind the veil of ignorance and outlines Garner 's fundamental criticisms of Rawls . Modified versions of personhood that include animals are discussed . Cochrane closes the chapter by arguing that personhood and welfare should both be considered important ; in so doing , he points towards his own conception of justice for animals . 
 Communitarianism 
 Chapter five assesses the relationship between animals and communitarianism . Cochrane initially argues that communitarianism , using British society as an example , can be used to expand justice to animals . He devotes the remainder of the chapter to four arguments against this line of thought . First , communitarianism is particularist ; that is , the principles it expounds are wholly contingent on the values in the particular society . Second , there are difficulties inherent in finding " authentic " values within a given society . Third , societies often favour some animals over others , leaving <unk> animals vulnerable . Fourth , there is the question of whose values within a society matter : states often contain multiple communities with very different attitudes to animals . Consideration of this fourth question involves analysis of multiculturalism . 
 Marxism 
 Cochrane goes on , in chapter six , to consider Marxism . He outlines the discontinuities between humans and animals that exist for Karl Marx and considers the extent to which animal @-@ rights thinking is an example of bourgeois morality . These analyses serve to illustrate how Marxist thinking can be used to exclude animals , but counterarguments are offered . Cochrane then draws upon Catherine <unk> and Barbara Noske , who have argued that animals may represent an exploited group in a Marxist sense , but he is critical of the argument that this exploitation is caused by capitalism and that overthrowing capitalism would be a necessary step for achieving justice . He next considers David <unk> and Ted Benton , who have drawn upon the adage of " From each according to his ability , to each according to his need " in relation to animals ; Cochrane is wary about the use of the phrase for three reasons . First , it is unclear how central the idea is to Marxist thought ; second , it is a principle only for societies in advanced stages of communism ; and third , even if we assume we can know the needs of animals , it assumes that we should extend justice beyond sentient animals . Finally , Cochrane considers Benton 's proposal that liberal rights @-@ based approaches to animal justice cannot achieve their goal , and that Marxism can be used as a resource for political achievement . This is , for Cochrane , Marxism 's most important contribution in the area . 
 Feminism 
 Cochrane considers feminism , the final tradition he examines , in chapter seven . As with Marxism , there are historical links between feminism and animal liberation . Cochrane considers the putative interrelatedness , posited by some feminist theorists , of the oppression of animals and women , but denies that the liberation of animals and women are necessarily interdependent . He suggests that there are four ways that this relationship could be grounded . The first is an idea taken from theorists drawing upon ecofeminism , like Josephine Donovan . This is the claim the domination of women and animals are both due to a patriarchal elevation of the " rational " over the " natural " . The second is Carol J. Adams 's argument that the connection of meat @-@ eating and masculinity serves to oppress both women and animals , meaning that the liberation of both depends upon the end of meat @-@ eating . The third is that , as identified by Adams and Catharine MacKinnon , women and animals are linked and oppressed by linguistic norms . For example , women might be called cow , bitch or dog , which serves to denigrate both woman and animals . The fourth is the way that both animals and women are objectified , treated as mere things to be used towards the ends of others . Cochrane argues that women are not irrational , though animals are qualitatively less rationale than humans , meaning that the oppression and liberation of the two groups may differ . He challenges Adams 's claims about meat by envisioning a vegetarian but misogynistic society on the one hand and a society where the genders are equal but meat continues to be eaten . He challenges the claims about language by observing that some animal @-@ based insults are gender @-@ neutral ( for example , rat , pig , sheep ) , and some slurs to women ( for example , witch , <unk> , whore ) are unrelated to animals . Concerning objectification , Cochrane notes that women are not considered property under the law , though animals are . This makes their respective objectification importantly different . Next , the author rebuts five criticisms of reason @-@ based approaches — epitomised , for Cochrane , by Singer and Regan — to animal liberation from thinkers supportive of feminist care @-@ based approaches , before outlining and rejecting an emotionally driven , care @-@ based approach to animal justice . 
 Conclusion 
 In the final chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an important contribution to make to animal justice , particularly liberalism and utilitarianism . He then outlines his own approach . He writes that , while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever , it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory . He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory , and that animals are owed justice . If the book 's claims are correct , Cochrane concludes , questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today . 
 = = Central argument = = 
 Cochrane argues that while each of the schools of thought he has considered has problems , they all have something important to contribute to the debate . Utilitarianism 's most important contribution is its focus on sentience , but its major failing is its lack of respect for individuals . Liberalism , on the other hand , asserts the centrality of the individual . Communitarianism , though it is too ready to attribute cohesion to the values of a given society , observes that individuals can flourish only within appropriate communities , and stresses the importance of changing the views of society at large . This latter idea is shared by Marxism , which points out that legal change does not necessarily equate to effective change . While Cochrane does not agree that capitalism must be overthrown , he recognises that " fundamental shifts in the organisation , norms and institutions of society " are needed for justice to be extended to animals . Care @-@ based feminist approaches , despite Cochrane 's criticism , remind us that emotions and sympathy should not be ignored . 
 Cochrane 's own sympathies lie most strongly with utilitarianism and liberalism ; his own account is most influenced by them . He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on what can be done to them . These rights cannot be violated , even in the name of the greater good , which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected . Anticipating criticism , Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right . A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book . The argument was expanded in Cochrane 's Animal Rights Without Liberation ( 2012 ) which , though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory , was based on his doctoral thesis . 
 = = Academic reception = = 
 An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory was reviewed by Garner for the Journal of Animal Ethics , the political philosopher Steve Cooke for the Political Studies Review and the sociologist Richard Seymour for the LSE Review of Books . All three reviewers were broadly positive towards the work . Cooke recommended it for " readers interested both in the moral and political standing of animals and in political theory in general " , the latter group because the work 's methodological approach allows it to serve as a good introduction to political theory generally . Seymour considered the book a " refreshing and comprehensive overview of a highly interesting issue " . Garner said that the book came " highly recommended " ; he considered it " a very fine book " , in which " Cochrane expertly simplifies and synthesizes a huge and complex literature in the limited space available to him , while retaining high scholarly standards " . Garner also praised the fact that the book remained interesting , unlike many textbooks . 
 Palgrave Macmillan advertised the book with quotes taken from Cooke and Garner 's respective reviews , as well as with quotes from Daniel A. Dombrowski and Siobhan O 'Sullivan . Dombrowski was quoted as saying that the " book will be welcomed by all who are interested in the relationship between non @-@ human animals and political theory , a relationship that has been underexplored by scholars . Highly recommended ! " Meanwhile , O 'Sullivan wrote : 
 If only Cochrane had been writing when I was an undergraduate political science student ! But this book 's appeal will not be limited to students . This is one of the first comprehensive articulations of what mainstream political values might mean for animals – something the academic community has desperately needed for far too long . It 's a great read and an important contribution . 
 Cooke considered Cochrane 's own account to be " interesting and worthy of further consideration " and found his supporting arguments to be " convincing " , but he worried that the account was not considered in the depth it warranted . He wrote that An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory would have benefited if more space had been given to the interest @-@ based account . Further , Cooke noted that , in covering such a wide array of positions , Cochrane had to sacrifice depth of argument ; Cooke considered this unproblematic , as readers could easily follow up the thinkers cited . Seymour was particularly critical of Cochrane 's coverage of feminism , which was , for him , " an unfortunate lapse in an otherwise fascinating review " . Seymour argued that Cochrane 's critique was superficial or " [ missed ] the point entirely " . Instead , he suggested , feminist approaches provide a potentially highly productive approach to the subject . 
 In response to An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory , Garner raised two themes , the first of which was the use of the concept of justice . Agreeing with Cochrane that the concept is the defining feature of a political account , as opposed to more general accounts of animal ethics , Garner nevertheless found Cochrane 's account of justice to be " too broad and loose " . In the book , Cochrane considers justice for animals to be " about recognising that the treatment of animals is a matter for political communities to enforce " and " recognising that the treatment of animals is something that political communities ought to enforce for the sake of animals themselves " . For Garner , 
 The problem with this is that it arguably includes too much — for it implies that once the state recognizes that we have direct duties to animals , that what we do to them matters to them , then the demands of justice are met . This means that , with the exception of those who hold that we have only indirect duties to animals , all the traditions that Cochrane discusses can lay claim to offering a theory of justice for animals . 
 Further , Garner suggests that Cochrane is " perhaps unduly uncritical of the utility of employing justice as a means to protect the interests of animals " . He outlines two ways that animals might be protected without being the recipients of justice ; first , they may be owed direct duties outside of justice , or , second , they might be protected by means of indirect duties , meaning that they are protected because of what humans owe to one another . Despite raising these themes in his review of An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory , Garner later rejected both possibilities in his own work , arguing that animals should be considered recipients of justice . 
 The second theme Garner identified was the divide between ideal and nonideal theory , which he understands as a way political theory may be used to <unk> animal ethics and further the debate . Ultimately , for Garner , Cochrane 's theory serves as a challenge to abolitionism , which , Garner fears , both polarises the debate and is unrealistic . The themes of this review were built upon in Garner 's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals . In the course of his review of the book , Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane 's second book , Animal Rights Without Liberation , which offers a lengthier defence of the interest @-@ based rights theory . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics described An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory as " the first introductory level text to offer an accessible overview on the status of animals in contemporary political theory " , while commentators noted that it was one of the first works — previous books on the subject having been written by Garner and Martha Nussbaum — to link the question of animal rights to the concept of justice in political philosophy . Since the book 's publication , a number of works exploring animals in political theory have been published ; these works have been collectively referred to as belonging to the " political turn " in animal ethics / animal rights , or the disciplines of " animal political philosophy " and " Animal Politics " . Both An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory and Animal Rights Without Liberation have become an established part of this literature .

 Portman Road is an association football stadium in Ipswich , Suffolk , England . It has been the home ground of Ipswich Town F.C. since 1884 . The stadium has also hosted a number of England youth international matches , and one senior England friendly international match , against Croatia in 2003 . It has staged several other sporting events , including athletics meetings and international hockey matches . In addition , musical concerts and Christian events have been held at the ground . 
 The stadium underwent significant redevelopments in the early 2000s , which increased the capacity from 22 @,@ 600 to a current figure of 30 @,@ 311 , making it the largest capacity football ground in East Anglia . Each of its four stands have since been converted to all @-@ seater , following the recommendations of the Taylor Report . Also located at the ground are conference and banqueting facilities , the Sir Bobby Robson Suite , Legends Bar and a club store selling Ipswich Town merchandise . 
 = = History = = 
 Ipswich played their early matches at Broomhill Park , but in 1884 , the club moved to Portman Road and have played there ever since . The ground was also used as a cricket pitch during the summer by the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855 . The cricket club had erected a pavilion , the first fixed building at the ground . More substantial elements of ground development did not begin for a further 11 years , though Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets in 1890 . At this time , Ipswich were an amateur side ( the team became professional in 1936 ) and the first visit of a professional club came in 1892 , when Preston North End played a Suffolk County Football Association team . This was followed six years later by a visit from Aston Villa , a game which was so popular that a temporary stand was erected in order to accommodate a crowd of around 5 @,@ 000 . In 1901 , a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground by the Churchman brothers , a name which would later become synonymous with the south stand located there . 
 The first permanent stand , a wooden structure known affectionately as the " Chicken Run " , was built on the Portman Road side of the ground in 1906 . This structure was sold in 1971 to the local speedway team , the Ipswich Witches , who installed it at Foxhall Stadium . Two amateur internationals were held at the ground in 1910 , with England winning 10 – 1 against Bohemia and 20 – 0 against France . In 1914 , the ground was commandeered by the British Army for use as a training camp for the duration of the First World War . Control of Portman Road was not returned to the club until two years after the end of the war and significant work was required to repair damage to the ground caused by heavy machinery . 
 For a short period during the 1920s , Portman Road was host to a number of whippet races in an attempt to increase revenue , and in 1928 a small stand was built on the west side of the ground . The football club turned professional in 1936 and the cricket club were forced to move out , so work began on the first bank of terracing at the north end of the pitch . The following year , on the back of winning the Southern League , a similar terrace was built at the southern " Churchmans " end and 650 tip @-@ up seats , bought from Arsenal , were installed . Portman Road was home to Ipswich Town 's first Football League match on 27 August 1938 , a 4 – 2 victory against Southend United in Division Three ( South ) witnessed by more than 19 @,@ 000 spectators . 
 The Supporters ' Association funded a number of improvements at Portman Road ; in 1952 , concrete terracing replaced the wooden terraces at the cost of £ 3 @,@ 000 and another £ 3 @,@ 000 was used to re @-@ terrace the North Stand in 1954 , bringing the capacity of the ground to approximately 29 @,@ 000 . In 1957 , the association raised £ 30 @,@ 500 towards the building of a new West Stand , increasing ground capacity to around 31 @,@ 000 . Floodlights were installed two years later ; the result of £ 15 @,@ 000 raised by the association . The floodlights were switched on by club president Lady Blanche Cobbold for the first floodlit match at the ground , a friendly against Arsenal , in February 1960 . 
 Television cameras made their debut at Portman Road in 1962 as Anglia Television arrived for Match of the Week ; it was another six years before the BBC televised a match at the ground , Match of the Day visiting Portman Road for the first time in 1968 to witness Ipswich 's league fixture against Birmingham City . 
 Meanwhile , ground development continued with roofing enhancements to the North Stand and an increase in capacity to 31 @,@ 500 by 1963 . Dressing rooms were constructed in 1965 and new turnstiles were introduced two years later , including a separate entrance for juveniles at the Churchmans end . In 1968 the club agreed to a new 99 @-@ year lease on the ground with owners Ipswich Borough Council . 
 The two @-@ tier propped cantilever Portman Stand was built along the east side of the ground in place of the existing terraces in 1971 , providing 3 @,@ 500 additional seats and increasing the capacity of the ground to approximately 37 @,@ 000 . Advertising appeared around the perimeter of the ground in the same year , while the following year saw the construction of the " Centre Spot " restaurant underneath the Portman Stand . Additional seating was added to the Portman Stand in 1974 and the ground saw its record attendance of 38 @,@ 010 the following year in an FA Cup tie against Leeds United . Following success in the 1978 FA Cup , the club invested in 24 executive boxes in front of the Portman Stand and , as a result of the Safety of Sports Ground Act ( 1975 ) , reduced the capacity in front by introducing seats , taking the overall capacity down to 34 @,@ 600 . 
 Plastic seats replaced wooden benches in the West Stand in 1980 and in the following year , the club announced a deal with electronics company Pioneer Corporation with the stand expanded at a cost of around £ <unk> , renamed as the Pioneer Stand and re @-@ opened in 1983 . However , the cost of building the stand meant the club had to sell players , and led to a decline in fortunes on the pitch . Safety barriers were removed from the North Stand in 1989 following the Hillsborough disaster and following the recommendations of the Taylor Report , the terraces in both the North and South stands were also converted to all @-@ seating . The Pioneer Stand was renamed as the Britannia Stand following a new sponsorship deal with the building society in 1999 , and in the following year a statue of Sir Alf Ramsey was unveiled at the corner of Portman Road and Sir Alf Ramsey Way . 
 Success for Ipswich Town in promotion to the Premier League in 2000 led to further investment in the infrastructure , with the club spending around £ 22 million on redeveloping both the North and South stands . The complete renovation of the South Stand into a two @-@ tier stand added 4 @,@ 000 seats to the stadium . The subsequent demolition and reconstruction of a two @-@ tier North Stand added a further 4 @,@ 000 seats and brought the total capacity of the ground to more than 30 @,@ 000 . In 2001 , local brewery Greene King took on the sponsorship of the updated South Stand and as such , the stand was renamed the Greene King stand until 2009 , when the sponsorship deal ended and the name changed back to the original ' South Stand ' . 
 Following the death of former manager Bobby Robson in 2009 , the club announced that the North Stand would be renamed as the Sir Bobby Robson Stand . The official unveiling took place at half time during the league match hosting Newcastle United , another of Robson 's former clubs , on 26 September 2009 . On 31 March 2012 , the South Stand was renamed the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand in memory of Sir Alf Ramsey who guided Ipswich Town to the Old First Division title . The season was the 50th anniversary of Ipswich Town winning the old First Division title . On 10 July 2012 , the Britannia Stand was renamed East of England Co @-@ operative Stand following a sponsorship deal with the East of England Co @-@ operative Society .

 The pitch is surrounded by four all @-@ seater stands , the Sir Bobby Robson Stand , the Cobbold Stand , the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the East of England Co @-@ operative Stand Stand . All stands are covered and are multi @-@ tiered . 
 The Cobbold Stand was constructed in 1971 , and originally known as the Portman Stand . With two tiers and a cantilever roof , it is used to accommodate away fans , with an allocation of up to 3 @,@ 000 seats per game and for family seating . It also contains a number of executive boxes as well as regular seating for home fans . The Sir Alf Ramsey Stand is a two @-@ tiered stand which has a match @-@ day capacity of approximately 7 @,@ 000 . It also houses the " Sir Bobby Robson Suite " restaurant and " Legends Bar " . The tunnel , from which the players emerge onto the pitch from their dressing rooms , is unusually located in the corner of the stadium between the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the East of England Co @-@ operative <unk> . 
 The East of England Co @-@ operative <unk> was originally constructed in 1952 as a simple concrete seating area . It was updated to an all @-@ seater stand in 1990 and currently has three tiers consisting of home fan seating and an additional family area . It also contains the directors ' box , further executive boxes and the press area . Behind the stand is a full @-@ size AstroTurf pitch which is often used on a casual basis by fans before home games . The Sir Bobby Robson Stand was completely rebuilt in 2001 and has a capacity of around 7 @,@ 500 . It is a two @-@ tier cantilever stand which is divided into an adults @-@ only lower tier " ... traditionally for the ' hard core ' Town fan ... " and a mixed upper tier . 
 There are nine areas throughout the ground designated for disabled supporters , in the lower East of England Co @-@ operative Stand , the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the Sir Bobby Robson Stand . These provide over 300 spaces to accommodate wheelchair users and <unk> disabled , together with their carers . The ground also provides 12 seats in the East of England Co @-@ operative Stand for visually impaired spectators with commentary via individual radio headsets in each seat , provided by local radio station BBC Radio Suffolk . 
 The former groundsman , Alan Ferguson , received a number of accolades , including both Premiership and Championship Groundsman of the Year , and the pitch was voted the best in the Championship for two consecutive seasons in 2004 and 2005 . 
 There are statues of Sir Alf Ramsey and Sir Bobby Robson , both former Ipswich Town and England managers , outside the ground . Nearby Portman 's Walk was renamed Sir Alf Ramsey Way in 1999 .

 The official synopsis for both films was published in The Moving Picture World on January 14 , 1911 . The first film , Everybody Saves Father is focused on Jennie Gear , a young woman whose affections are sought by many men . Jennie 's father thinks his daughter is too young to be married and drives off four of her suitors . One of the men , John , concocts a plan to save his life to win the man 's approval . The plan is heard by another suitor , George , who decides to hire a rowboat to save the old man himself . This is over heard by George who concocts his own rescue to foil George .

All the miners are lured to the building , save the girl , and Bill 's accomplices proceed to rob the men . She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery , but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men . Struck with an idea , she returns home for her father 's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall . The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps , where they are captured .

 Film historian Q. David Bowers does not cite credits for Everybody Saves Father . Though Bowers does not cite credits for The Only Girl in Camp , the rediscovered film and identification of film stills have provided credit for Frank H. Crane , William Garwood , Violet Heming and Tom Fortune . The other cast credits are unknown , but many Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes G.W. Abbe , Justus D. Barnes , Frank H. Crane , Irene Crane , Marie Eline , Violet Heming , Martin J. Faust , Thomas Fortune , George Middleton , Grace Moore , John W. Noble , Anna Rosemond , Mrs. George Walters . 
 The writer of the scenarios was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director may have been Barry O 'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions though cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith , Alfred H. Moses , Jr. and Carl Louis Gregory .

 Everybody Saves Father and The Only Girl in Camp were released together on a single reel , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet in length , on January 10 , 1911 . The total length of Everybody Saves Father is approximately 450 feet long and the Only Girl in Camp is 480 feet long . Though both films were on a split reel , sometimes the films were advertised independently or listed Everybody Saves Father only . Theaters showing the one or possibly both films are known in North Carolina Indiana , Texas , Kansas , Arizona , Pennsylvania , and California . A surviving nitrate print of The Only Girl in Camp was sold on eBay in 2009 . The film was purchased and deposited in the Library of Congress for preservation . 
 Everybody Saves Father was met with positive reviews in the trade publications . The Billboard review stated , " The comedy is distinctively American and makes a good subject . The photography is excellent and the acting clever . " The Moving Picture World affirmed that it was a good lively and laughable comedy . The two reviews were also backed by The New York Dramatic Mirror 's positive review of the comedy production . The publications would also review The Only Girl in Camp were more or less neutral , but the The Billboard highlighted how the prop traps could not believably work and hold a man as they did in the film . The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for the novelty of the production without any criticism . 
 = Reinhard Scheer = 
 Reinhard Scheer ( 30 September 1863 – 26 November 1928 ) was an Admiral in the Imperial German Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . Scheer joined the navy in 1879 as an officer cadet ; he progressed through the ranks , commanding cruisers and battleships , as well as major staff positions on land . At the outbreak of World War I , Scheer was the commander of the II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet . He then took command of the III Battle Squadron , which consisted of the newest and most powerful battleships in the navy . In January 1916 , he was promoted to Admiral and given control of the High Seas Fleet . Scheer led the German fleet at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , one of the largest naval battles in history . 
 Following the battle , Scheer joined those calling for unrestricted submarine warfare against the Allies , a move the Kaiser eventually permitted . In August 1918 , Scheer was promoted to the Chief of Naval Staff ; Admiral Franz von Hipper replaced him as commander of the fleet . Together they planned a final battle against the British Grand Fleet , but war @-@ weary sailors mutinied at the news and the operation was abandoned . Scheer retired after the end of the war . 
 A strict disciplinarian , Scheer was popularly known in the Navy as the " man with the iron mask " due to his severe appearance . In 1919 , Scheer wrote his memoirs ; a year later they were translated and published in English . He wrote his autobiography in 1925 . Scheer died at <unk> . He is buried in the municipal cemetery at Weimar . The admiral was commemorated in the renascent Kriegsmarine by the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer , built in the 1930s . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Scheer was born in <unk> , present @-@ day Lower Saxony . He came from a middle @-@ class background , which initially hampered his naval career , as the Kaiserliche Marine was dominated by wealthy families . 
 Reinhard Scheer entered the navy on 22 April 1879 aged 15 as a cadet . His first sea assignment was aboard the sail @-@ frigate SMS Niobe . His first cruise aboard Niobe lasted from June to September 1879 . During the cruise he was trained in navigation and engineering . Following his return to Germany in September , Scheer was assigned to the Naval School in Kiel to continue his officer training . He received only a " satisfactory " rating on his cadet evaluation in 1879 , but received the second highest grade in his class for the Sea Cadet 's Exam the following year . Following his graduation from the Naval School , Scheer embarked on a six @-@ month @-@ long special training program for gunnery , torpedo warfare , and infantry training . Afterward , he was assigned to the gunnery training ship SMS Renown . Scheer was for a short time assigned to the armored frigate SMS Friedrich Carl . For his last year in cadet training , he was assigned to the frigate SMS Hertha , which conducted a world tour . The ship sailed to Melbourne , Australia , Yokohama , Kobe , and Nagasaki in Japan , and Shanghai , China during the trip . 
 Following his commission into the German navy , he was transferred to the East Africa Squadron ; his first tour with the unit lasted from 1884 to 1886 . He was assigned to the crew of the frigate SMS Bismarck . Here he was promoted to Leutnant . He also made important connections in Africa ; among those he befriended was Leutnant Henning von Holtzendorff , who would later serve as commander of the High Seas Fleet . During the assignment , on December 1884 , Scheer participated in a landing party that suppressed a pro @-@ British indigenous chieftain in Kamerun . 
 After his return to Germany in 1886 , Scheer took part in torpedo training aboard SMS Blücher , from January to May 1888 . In May 1888 , Scheer returned to the East Africa Squadron as a torpedo officer aboard the corvette SMS Sophie . This tour lasted until early summer 1890 , at which point Scheer returned to Germany , where he was made an instructor at the Torpedo Research Command in Kiel . Thus far in his career , Scheer had made a strong reputation for himself as a torpedo specialist . While stationed in Kiel , Scheer met Alfred von Tirpitz , who took note of his expertise . In 1897 , following von Tirpitz 's promotion to Secretary of State of the Imperial Navy Office , he transferred Scheer to the Reichsmarineamt ( RMA ) to work in the Torpedo Section . 
 After promotion to Korvettenkapitän , Scheer commanded the light cruiser SMS Gazelle . 
 Scheer was promoted to Kapitän zur See in 1905 and took command of the battleship SMS Elsass in 1907 , a command he held for two years . A report dated 1 December 1909 recommended Scheer for promotion ; he became chief of staff to the commanding officer of the High Seas Fleet , Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff , under whom Scheer had served on the cruiser SMS Prinzess Wilhelm . Scheer reached flag rank less than six months after taking his post on von Holtzendorff 's staff , at the age of 47 . He held the Chief of Staff position until late 1911 , when he was transferred back to the RMA under Alfred von Tirpitz . Here , he held the position of Chief of the General Naval Department through 1912 . Following this appointment , Scheer returned to a sea command , in the form of squadron commander for the six battleships of the II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet in January 1913 . 
 = = World War I = = 
 On 9 December 1913 , Scheer was promoted to Vizeadmiral . He remained with the II Battle Squadron until January 1915 , by which time World War I had begun . He thereafter took command of the III Battle Squadron , which consisted of the most powerful battleships in the German fleet : the dreadnoughts of the Kaiser and König classes . Scheer advocated raids on the British coast to lure out portions of the numerically superior Royal Navy so they could be overwhelmed by the German fleet . He was highly critical of Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl , who he felt was overcautious . 
 Following the bombardment of Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby , during which Ingenohl had withdrawn instead of attacking a weaker British squadron , Scheer remarked , " [ Ingenohl ] had robbed us of the opportunity of meeting certain divisions of the enemy according to the prearranged plan , which was now seen to be correct . " Following the loss of SMS Blücher at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 , the Kaiser removed Ingenohl from his post on 2 February . Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet . Pohl was exceedingly cautious ; in the remainder of 1915 , he conducted only five ineffective fleet actions , all of which remained within 120 nautical miles of Helgoland . 
 = = = Command of the High Seas fleet = = = 
 Vice Admiral Scheer became Commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Pohl became too ill to continue in that post . Upon promotion to the position , Scheer wrote Guiding Principles for Sea Warfare in the North Sea , which outlined his strategic plans . His central idea was that the Grand Fleet should be pressured by higher U @-@ boat activity and zeppelin raids as well as increased fleet sorties . The Grand Fleet would be forced to abandon the distant blockade and would have to attack the German fleet ; the Kaiser approved the memorandum on 23 February 1916 . Now that he had approval from the Kaiser , Scheer could use the fleet more aggressively . 
 Following the Kaiser 's order forbidding unrestricted submarine warfare on 24 April 1916 , Scheer ordered all of the U @-@ boats in the Atlantic to return to Germany and abandon commerce raiding . Scheer intended to use the submarines to support the fleet by stationing the U @-@ boats off major British naval bases . The U @-@ boats would intercept British forces leaving the ports when provoked by a bombardment by the I Scouting Group battlecruisers under the command of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper . Scheer planned the operation for 17 May , but damage to the battlecruiser SMS Seydlitz from the previous month , coupled with condenser trouble on several of the battleships of III Battle Squadron caused the plan to be delayed , ultimately to 31 May . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 Admiral Scheer 's fleet , composed of 16 dreadnoughts , six pre @-@ dreadnoughts , six light cruisers , and 31 torpedo boats departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May . The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper 's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats . The British navy 's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation , and so sortied the Grand Fleet , totaling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers , the night before in order to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet . 
 At 16 : 00 UTC , the two battlecruiser forces encountered each other and began a running gun fight south , back towards Scheer 's battle fleet . Upon reaching the High Seas Fleet , Vice Admiral David Beatty 's battlecruisers turned back to the north to lure the Germans towards the rapidly approaching Grand Fleet , under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe . During the run to the north , Scheer 's leading ships engaged the Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron . By 18 : 30 , the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene , and was deployed into a position that would cross Scheer 's " T " from the northeast . To extricate his fleet from this precarious position , Scheer ordered a 16 @-@ point turn to the south @-@ west . At 18 : 55 , Scheer decided to conduct another 16 @-@ point turn to launch an attack on the British fleet ; he later explained his reasoning : 
 It was as yet too early to assume ' night cruising order . ' The enemy could have compelled us to fight before dark , he could have prevented our exercising our initiative , and finally he could have cut off our return to the German Bight . There was only one way of avoiding this : to inflict a second blow on the enemy with another advance carried through regardless of cost ... It also offered the possibility of a last attempt being made to bring help to the hard @-@ pressed Wiesbaden , or at least of rescuing her ship 's company . 
 This maneuver again put Scheer in a dangerous position ; Jellicoe had turned his fleet south and again crossed Scheer 's " T. " A third 16 @-@ point turn followed , which was covered by a charge by Hipper 's mauled battlecruisers . Scheer then ordered the fleet to adopt the night cruising formation , which was completed by 23 : 40 . A series of ferocious engagements between Scheer 's battleships and Jellicoe 's destroyer screen ensued , though the Germans managed to punch their way through the destroyers and make for Horns Reef . The High Seas Fleet reached the Jade between 13 : 00 and 14 : 45 on 1 June ; Scheer ordered the undamaged battleships of the I Battle Squadron to take up defensive positions in the Jade roadstead while the Kaiser @-@ class battleships were to maintain a state of readiness just outside Wilhelmshaven . 
 = = = = Post @-@ Jutland = = = = 
 After the battle was finished , Scheer wrote an assessment of the engagement for the Kaiser ; in it , he strongly urged for the resumption of the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign in the Atlantic . He argued that it was the only option to defeat Great Britain . Scheer spent the majority of the remainder of the year debating the issue with the naval command . Ultimately , Scheer and his allies prevailed and the unrestricted submarine campaign was resumed in February 1917 . Despite his conviction that only the U @-@ boats could defeat Britain , Scheer continued to utilize the surface fleet . On 18 – 19 August 1916 , the High Seas Fleet again sortied in an attempt to draw out and defeat Admiral Beatty 's battlecruiser squadron . The Royal Navy again intercepted German communications and sent the Grand Fleet out . In this case , however , Scheer 's reconnaissance worked as intended , and warned him of the Grand Fleet 's approach in time to retreat back to Germany . In later 1917 , Scheer began to use light elements of the fleet to raid British convoys to Norway in the North Sea . This forced the British to deploy battleships to escort the convoys , which presented Scheer with the opportunity to attempt to isolate and destroy several battleships of the Grand Fleet . On 23 April 1918 , Scheer sent the entire High Seas Fleet to intercept one of the convoys . However , Hipper 's battlecruisers crossed the convoy 's path several times without sighting any ships ; it was later discovered that German intelligence had miscalculated the date the convoy would depart Britain . The German fleet turned south and reached their North Sea bases by 19 : 00 . 
 = = = Chief of Naval Staff = = = 
 In June 1918 , Scheer was informed that the state of Admiral von Holtzendorff 's health would not permit him to remain in his post as chief of the naval staff much longer . On 28 July , Scheer was informed that von Holtzendorff had submitted his resignation to the Kaiser . Two weeks later , on 11 August 1918 , Scheer was promoted to the Chief of Naval Staff ; his subordinate Franz von Hipper succeeded him in command of the High Seas Fleet . The following day , Scheer met with Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff to discuss the deteriorating war situation . The three agreed that the U @-@ boat campaign would be the sole hope for a German victory , as the German army had been pushed to the defensive . Scheer then called for a crash program to build a vastly increased number of U @-@ boats . He stipulated that , at a minimum , at least 16 additional U @-@ boats be constructed per month in the last quarter of 1918 . This was to increase to at least an additional 30 per month by the third quarter of 1919 . In total , the plan called for 376 to 450 new U @-@ boats . However , German naval historian Holger Herwig suggested the program was " a massive propaganda effort designed to have an effect at home and abroad . " 
 In October , with the war largely lost , Scheer and Hipper envisioned one last major fleet advance to attack the British Grand Fleet . Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , to achieve a better bargaining position for Germany regardless of the cost to the navy . The plan involved two simultaneous attacks by light cruisers and destroyers , one on Flanders and another on shipping in the Thames estuary ; the five battlecruisers were to support the Thames attack while the dreadnoughts remained off Flanders . After both strikes , the fleet was to concentrate off the Dutch coast , where it would meet the Grand Fleet in battle . While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven , however , war @-@ weary sailors began deserting en masse . As Von der Tann and Derfflinger passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven 's inner harbor and roadstead , some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore . On 24 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on several battleships mutinied ; three ships from the III Squadron refused to weigh anchors , and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships Thüringen and Helgoland . In the face of open rebellion , the order to sail was rescinded and the planned operation was abandoned . In an attempt to suppress the mutiny , the High Seas Fleet squadrons were dispersed . 
 = = Post @-@ war = = 
 Scheer wrote his memoirs of the Great War in 1919 , which were translated into English the following year . In October 1920 , an intruder broke into Scheer 's house and murdered his wife , <unk> and his maid , and injured his daughter Else . The man then committed suicide in the cellar . Following the incident , Scheer retreated into solitude . He wrote his autobiography , entitled Vom <unk> zum U @-@ Boot ( From Sailing Ship to Submarine ) , which was published on 6 November 1925 . 
 In 1928 , Scheer accepted an invitation to meet his adversary from Jutland , Admiral of the Fleet Lord Jellicoe , in England . However , at the age of 65 , Scheer died at <unk> before he could make the trip . He was buried in the municipal cemetery at Weimar . His tombstone reads : hier <unk> admiral <unk> <unk> [ Here rests Admiral Reinhard Scheer ] — with the dates of his life , his flag in metal <unk> and the single word <unk> ( the German name for the Battle of Jutland ) . 
 The heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer was named after Reinhard Scheer and christened by his daughter Marianne . The ship was ordered and funded by the Reichsmarine of the Weimar Republic and launched in 1933 .

 = Ontario Highway 409 = 
 King 's Highway 409 , commonly referred to as Highway 409 and historically as the Belfield Expressway , is a 400 @-@ series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that extends from Highway 401 in Toronto to Pearson International Airport , west of Highway 427 , in Mississauga . It is a short freeway used mainly as a spur route bypass for traffic approaching the airport or Highway 427 northbound from Highway 401 westbound , as both are not accessible at the complex interchange between Highways 401 and 427 . 
 Planning for Highway 409 took place throughout the late 1960s amidst considerable controversy around its original path through the historic town of Malton . Eventually the route was changed to provide access to the airport instead of towards Brampton and completed through the mid @-@ 1970s , opening in 1978 . The significance of the route has increased over the years alongside expansion of the airport . In 2000 , the Greater Toronto Airports Authority ( GTAA ) purchased the section west of Highway 427 in order to modify the ramps leading into the airport . 
 The speed limit along Highway 409 is 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) east of Highway 427 and 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) west of it . It is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police east of the Toronto – Peel boundary and by the Peel Regional Police to the west of it . The original name of the freeway was derived from the road running parallel to and north of it , Belfield Road . Belfield is a local road managed by the City of Toronto and runs from Kipling Avenue to Atwell Drive . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 409 serves as a direct link between Highway 401 , Highway 427 , and Pearson International Airport . While it is not intended as a commuter route , there are several exits serving the industrial areas of Etobicoke centred on the highway . Highway 409 also serves as the only connection between westbound Highway 401 and northbound Highway 427 , as no access is provided at the 401 – 427 interchange . 
 Highway 409 begins at Airport Road as the knotted flyovers from Toronto Pearson Airport converge into the freeway from the various terminals . Through this section to Highway 427 , the highway is maintained by the Greater Toronto Airport Authority ( GTAA ) and has a posted speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour ( 37 mph ) . 
 As the highway passes under Highway 427 , it turns right and takes on an east @-@ west orientation . It passes over Carlingview Drive , and begins to descend into a trench . It passes beneath Highway 27 , two railway spurs , and Iron Street before returning to level grade . Around the interchange with Martin Grove Road , the freeway twists slightly to the left and right between factories and warehouses . 
 At its eastern terminus , Highway 409 crosses Kipling Avenue and merges onto Highway 401 express and collector lanes , while the westbound collector lanes diverge and become the westbound lanes of Highway 409 . 
 = = History = = 
 Plans for Highway 409 , originally known as the Belfield Expressway , were first presented in 1965 to the Mississauga council . In September 1968 , three possible routes were submitted to the council . At the time , the town of Malton occupied the area of the planned expressway , having not yet been annexed as part of Mississauga . The 45 m ( 148 ft ) wide strip of land would require the expropriation and demolition of 50 houses , as well as several businesses , a school , and two community parks . Citizens of the village formed a group to protest the freeway and to demand another route be taken . An above grade alternative , similar to the Gardiner Expressway was proposed , as well as a tunnel under the airport . 
 However , at the same time , Toronto was embroiled in heated debate over the fate of its planned urban expressway system . When the Spadina Expressway was cancelled in 1971 , the planned Belfield Expressway was completely revised . Instead of continuing northwest from Highway 427 and through Malton 's four @-@ corners at Derry Road and Airport Road towards Brampton , it would curve southwest and provide access to the developing Pearson Airport . 
 Before plans for the new route were finalized , a flyover was built to provide access from Belfield Road to eastbound Highway 401 , opening on October 7 , 1968 . Because the lands on which the freeway was to be built were occupied , the province elected to apply to expropriate the right @-@ of @-@ way in April 1972 . Construction was underway by the end of the year , with the first contracts constructing the trench section near Highway 27 . Structures , drainage and grading were completed west of Iron Street to Carlingview Avenue in 1974 . In June of that year , contracts were awarded for the same work east of Iron Street to Highway 401 . When this was completed in 1975 , a paving contract was awarded from Carlingview Avenue to Highway 401 . 
 Highway 409 first opened to traffic by 1976 , with temporary ramps at Carlingview Avenue acting as the western terminus . That year the final contracts were awarded to construct portions of the Highway 427 interchange and connect Highway 409 with the airport road system . The entire freeway opened on August 25 , 1978 . 
 The flyover ramp , which connects southbound Highway 427 with eastbound Highway 409 was constructed in the early 1990s . Prior to that , an at @-@ grade intersection crossed the northbound lanes of Highway 427 , controlled by a traffic signal . This signal had the longest cycle of any traffic light in Toronto during its years of operation . 
 The portion of Highway 409 west of Highway 427 is owned and operated by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority ( GTAA ) . Despite its private ownership , the section east of Airport Road is still considered a part of Highway 409 . The GTAA purchased this section of the highway in 2000 in order to rebuild the approaches to Toronto Pearson Airport . 
 Until 2008 , Highway 409 remained almost unchanged from its original construction . However , beginning on July 10 , 2008 , traffic access was restricted to the outermost lanes . The steel " W " guardrail and truss light posts in the median were replaced by an Ontario Tall Wall barrier with a high @-@ mast lighting system . Construction was carried out over several years and was scheduled for completion on September 1 , 2011 .

 = Robert Tatton = 
 Robert Tatton ( 1606 – 19 August 1669 ) was the High Sheriff of Chester between 1645 and 1646 . A supporter of King Charles I in the English Civil War , Robert is perhaps best known for the ultimately unsuccessful defence of his family home , Wythenshawe Hall , during its three @-@ month siege by a Parliamentary force in the winter of 1643 / 44 . 
 Robert was fined heavily by Parliament for fighting on the side of the king , but he was subsequently rewarded for his loyalty by Charles II following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 . He and his wife Anne had six children the eldest of whom , William , inherited Robert 's Wythenshawe estate after his father 's death in 1669 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Robert 's father , William Tatton , drowned in the River Mersey when Robert was 10 years old . As the only male heir Robert inherited his father 's estate in Wythenshawe , but as a minor he was made a ward of the king , Charles I , until he came of age . On 9 January 1628 , Robert married Anne Brereton , the third daughter of William Brereton of Ashley . The couple went on to have four sons and two daughters . 
 Robert 's father @-@ in @-@ law William Brereton was a close relative of his namesake Sir William Brereton , who the year after Robert 's marriage was appointed Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Parliamentary troops in Cheshire following the outbreak of the English Civil War . The first pitched battle of the war was fought at Edgehill on 23 October 1642 , and Robert decided to join the Royalist side . 
 = = Siege of Wythenshawe Hall = = 
 Towards the end of 1643 the commander of the local Parliamentary forces in Cheshire , Colonel Robert <unk> , was ordered to seize Wythenshawe Hall and to remove anything of value that could be found . Forewarned , Robert Tatton recruited a group of more than 50 defenders from among his staff and Royalist friends . After ransacking the nearby village of Northenden the Roundheads arrived at Wythenshawe Hall on 21 November 1643 , but they did not find the task of taking it as easy as they had imagined . At one point during the siege the attackers almost took possession of the house in a struggle during which six of the defenders were killed . The Parliamentarians refused a truce to allow the bodies to be taken to the local church for proper services to be held , necessitating their burial in the garden behind the house . One of those killed was the fiancé of Mary Webb , a young woman who had been brought up by the <unk> and had remained in the house with the defenders . Towards the end of the siege Mary saw the man who had led the attack , <unk> 's second @-@ in @-@ command Captain Adams , sitting on a wall near the house . Borrowing a musket from one of the defenders , she shot him dead . 
 The siege ended on 27 February 1644 after the Parliamentarians brought two cannons from nearby Manchester , with which they " reduced " the hall . By then the defenders had exhausted their ammunition and had very little food left . The hall was confiscated ; an inventory taken after the surrender valued its contents at almost £ 1650 , equivalent to about £ 250 @,@ 000 as of 2016 . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Robert escaped and made his way to Chester , where in 1645 he was made High Sheriff of the county of Cheshire . But he was forced to flee from the city early the following year when it too was besieged by Parliamentary forces . This time he made for Oxford , where King Charles I was in residence , but it fell only a few months later on 24 June 1646 , effectively ending the war . 
 In the aftermath of the conflict Wythenshawe was included in a list of estates owned by Royalists that were to be forfeited to the new government . Robert 's entry is as follows : 
 His [ Robert 's ] <unk> , that hee deserted his owne <unk> , and went and lived in Oxford <unk> it was a Garrison holden for the <unk> <unk> the Parliament , and was there at the tyme of the surrender ... Hee hath neither taken the Negative Oath nor <unk> , but <unk> to be exempt upon the articles of Oxford and the Vote of the House of Commons <unk> . 
 Parliament allowed Robert to keep his estate on payment of a fine of £ 804 10s , reduced to £ 707 13s 4d in December 1646 , and Wythenshawe Hall was returned to him two years after its confiscation . Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 King Charles II rewarded Robert 's loyalty to the Crown by presenting him with a silver snuff box . 
 Robert Tatton died on 19 August 1669 and was buried at St Wilfrid 's parish church in Northenden , which contains a wall monument in his memory . His eldest son William ( born 1636 ) inherited the Wythenshawe estate .

 " Pumpin ' Up the Party " is a pop song by American recording artist and actress Miley Cyrus . She is performing as Hannah Montana – the alter ego of Miley Stewart , a character she played on the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana . " Pumpin ' Up the Party " was written and produced by Jaime Houston . The song was released to Radio Disney as promotion for the series and its first soundtrack , Hannah Montana . The song has teen pop and dance @-@ pop influences . 
 In the United States , the song peaked at number eighty @-@ one on the Billboard Hot 100 and within the top seventy on the Pop 100 . Its appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 made Cyrus the first act to have six songs debut on the chart in the same week . A music video for " Pumpin ' Up the Party " was taken from footage of a concert performance . Cyrus , dressed as Hannah Montana , performed the song during the Best of Both Worlds Tour ( 2007 – 08 ) .

 Due to the success of several tracks he wrote for the High School Musical soundtrack ( 2006 ) , Walt Disney Records representatives contacted songwriter Jaime Houston to propose work for Hannah Montana . Houston accepted the proposal and solely penned " Pumpin ' Up the Party " for the series ' first soundtrack . A karaoke version appears on Disney 's Karaoke Series : Hannah Montana ( 2007 ) , while a remixed version appears on Hits Remixed ( 2008 ) . The song first premiered on Radio Disney in order to promote the series and soundtrack . 
 " Pumpin ' Up the Party " is pop song that lasts three minutes and nine seconds . Heather Phares of Allmusic described the song as a groove that is influenced by teen pop and dance @-@ pop genres . " Pumpin ' Up the Party " is set in common time and has a moderately fast tempo of 150 beats per minute . It is written in the key of E major and Cyrus ' vocals spans one octave , from A3 to B4 .

 = Maurice Ravel = 
 Joseph Maurice Ravel ( French : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937 ) was a French composer , pianist and conductor . He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term . In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France 's greatest living composer . 
 Born to a music @-@ loving family , Ravel attended France 's premier music college , the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment , whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal . After leaving the conservatoire Ravel found his own way as a composer , developing a style of great clarity , incorporating elements of baroque , neoclassicism and , in his later works , jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form , as in his best @-@ known work , Boléro ( 1928 ) , in which repetition takes the place of development . He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers ' music , of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known . 
 As a slow and painstaking worker , Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries . Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano , chamber music , two piano concertos , ballet music , two operas , and eight song cycles ; he wrote no symphonies or religious works . Many of his works exist in two versions : a first , piano score and a later orchestration . Some of his piano music , such as Gaspard de la nuit ( 1908 ) , is exceptionally difficult to play , and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chloé ( 1912 ) require skilful balance in performance . 
 Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public . From the 1920s , despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor , he took part in recordings of several of his works ; others were made under his supervision . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Ravel was born in the Basque town of <unk> , France , near Biarritz , 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) from the Spanish border . His father , Pierre @-@ Joseph Ravel , was an educated and successful engineer , inventor and manufacturer , born in <unk> near the Franco @-@ Swiss border . His mother , Marie , née <unk> , was Basque but had grown up in Madrid . In 19th @-@ century terms , Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one . Some of Joseph 's inventions were successful , including an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine , the " Whirlwind of Death " , an automotive loop @-@ the @-@ loop that was a big draw until a fatal accident at Barnum and Bailey 's Circus in 1903 . 
 Both Ravel 's parents were Roman Catholics ; Marie was also something of a free @-@ thinker , a trait inherited by her elder son , who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life . He was baptised in the <unk> parish church six days after he was born . The family moved to Paris three months later , and there a younger son , Édouard , was born . He was close to his father , whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession . Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother ; her Basque @-@ Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music . Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him . The household was not rich , but the family was comfortable , and the two boys had happy childhoods . 
 Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices , but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general . In later life , Ravel recalled , " Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music . My father , much better educated in this art than most amateurs are , knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age . " There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years ; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father . 
 When he was seven Ravel started piano lessons with Henry <unk> , a friend of Emmanuel Chabrier ; five years later , in 1887 , he began studying harmony , counterpoint and composition with Charles @-@ René , a pupil of Léo Delibes . Without being anything of a child prodigy , he was a highly musical boy . Charles @-@ René found that Ravel 's conception of music was natural to him " and not , as in the case of so many others , the result of effort " . Ravel 's earliest known compositions date from this period : variations on a chorale by Schumann , variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata . They survive only in fragmentary form . 
 In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist Ricardo Viñes , who became not only a lifelong friend , but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works , and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music . The two shared an appreciation of Wagner , Russian music , and the writings of Poe , Baudelaire , and Mallarmé . At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889 , Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky @-@ Korsakov . This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy , as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan , also heard during the Exposition . 
 Émile <unk> took over as Ravel 's piano teacher in 1889 ; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance . Aged fourteen , he took part in a concert at the Salle Érard along with other pupils of <unk> , including Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot . 
 = = = Paris Conservatoire = = = 
 With the encouragement of his parents , Ravel applied for entry to France 's most important musical college , the Conservatoire de Paris . In November 1889 , playing music by Chopin , he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène <unk> . Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire 's piano competition in 1891 , but otherwise he did not stand out as a student . Nevertheless , these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer . The musicologist <unk> Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period " of immense growth ... from adolescence to maturity . " 
 In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles @-@ Wilfrid de <unk> , for piano , and Émile <unk> , for harmony . He made solid , unspectacular progress , with particular encouragement from <unk> but , in the words of the musical scholar Barbara L. Kelly , he " was only teachable on his own terms " . His later teacher Gabriel Fauré understood this , but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s . Ravel was expelled in 1895 , having won no more prizes . His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days : Sérénade grotesque , for piano , and " Ballade de la Reine morte d 'aimer " , a mélodie setting a poem by Rolande de <unk> ( both 1893 ) . 
 Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were . It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them , and his overriding ambition was to be a composer . From this point he concentrated on composition . His works from the period include the songs " Un grand sommeil noir " and " D 'Anne <unk> de l <unk> " to words by Paul Verlaine and Clément Marot , and the piano pieces Menuet antique and Habanera , the latter eventually incorporated into the Rapsodie espagnole . At around this time , Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie , who was earning a living as a café pianist . Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie 's originality and talent . Satie 's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel , who counted them " of inestimable value " . 
 In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire , studying composition with Fauré , and taking private lessons in counterpoint with André <unk> . Both these teachers , particularly Fauré , regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer . As Ravel 's course progressed , Fauré reported " a distinct gain in maturity ... engaging wealth of imagination " . Ravel 's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director , Théodore Dubois , who deplored the young man 's musically and politically progressive outlook . Consequently , according to a fellow @-@ student , Michel @-@ Dimitri Calvocoressi , he was " a marked man , against whom all weapons were good " . He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré , including the overture Shéhérazade and a violin sonata , but he won no prizes , and therefore was expelled again in 1900 . As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré 's classes as a non @-@ participating " <unk> " until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903 . 
 In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known , though it made little impact initially : Pavane pour une infante défunte ( " Pavane for a dead princess " ) . It was originally a solo piano work , commissioned by the Princesse de Polignac . In the same year he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture , which had a mixed reception , with boos mingling with applause from the audience , and unflattering reviews from the critics . One described the piece as " a jolting debut : a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School " and called Ravel a " <unk> gifted debutant ... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years , if he works hard . " Another critic , Pierre Lalo , thought that Ravel showed talent , but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven . Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel 's most implacable critic . 
 From the start of his career , Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise . Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine . The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own , perfectionist and severely self @-@ critical . At twenty years of age he was , in the words of the biographer Burnett James , " self @-@ possessed , a little aloof , intellectually biased , given to mild banter . " He dressed like a dandy and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour . Orenstein comments that , short in stature , light in frame , and bony in features , Ravel had the " appearance of a well @-@ dressed jockey " , whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect . During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century , Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day ; from his mid @-@ thirties he was clean @-@ shaven . 
 = = = Les Apaches and Debussy = = = 
 Around 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists , poets , critics , and musicians joined together in an informal group ; they came to be known as Les Apaches ( " The Hooligans " ) , a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as " artistic outcasts " . They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War , and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works . The membership of the group was fluid , and at various times included Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla as well as their French friends . 
 Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy . Ravel , twelve years his junior , had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s , and their friendship , though never close , continued for more than ten years . In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy 's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra @-@ Comique . It divided musical opinion . Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend , and the conductor 's friend and former teacher Camille Saint @-@ Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece . The Apaches were loud in their support . The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances : Ravel attended all of them . 
 Debussy was widely held to be an impressionist composer – a label he intensely disliked . Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel , and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre . Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not . Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship . Ravel wrote that Debussy 's " genius was obviously one of great individuality , creating its own laws , constantly in evolution , expressing itself freely , yet always faithful to French tradition . For Debussy , the musician and the man , I have had profound admiration , but by nature I am different from Debussy ... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of [ his ] symbolism " . During the first years of the new century Ravel 's new works included the piano piece Jeux d 'eau ( 1901 ) , the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade ( both 1903 ) . Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works . Nichols calls the quartet " at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy 's influence " . 
 The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the 1900s , for musical and possibly personal reasons . Their admirers began to form factions , with adherents of one composer denigrating the other . Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers ' works and who influenced whom . Prominent in the anti @-@ Ravel camp was Lalo , who wrote , " Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity , M. Ravel is all insensitivity , borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people . " The public tension led to personal estrangement . Ravel said , " It 's probably better for us , after all , to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons . " Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift . In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac . Ravel , together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne <unk> , contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy , a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband . 
 = = = Scandal and success = = = 
 During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France 's most prestigious prize for young composers , the Prix de Rome , past winners of which included Berlioz , Gounod , Bizet , Massenet and Debussy . In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round ; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition . In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing : according to the musicologist Paul <unk> , the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies . In 1905 Ravel , by now thirty , competed for the last time , inadvertently causing a furore . He was eliminated in the first round , which even critics unsympathetic to his music , including Lalo , denounced as unjustifiable . The press 's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire , Charles <unk> , was on the jury , and only his students were selected for the final round ; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received . L 'affaire Ravel became a national scandal , leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré , appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire . 
 Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was Alfred Edwards , owner and editor of Le Matin , for which Lalo wrote . Edwards was married to Ravel 's friend Misia ; the couple took Ravel on a seven @-@ week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905 , the first time he had travelled abroad . 
 By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra . He was in general a slow and painstaking worker , and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed . There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this ; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters . The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte ( orchestrated 1910 ) , Une barque sur l <unk> ( 1906 , from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs ) , the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole ( 1907 – 08 ) , Ma mère l 'Oye ( 1908 – 10 , orchestrated 1911 ) , Valses nobles et sentimentales ( 1911 , orchestrated 1912 ) , Alborada del gracioso ( from Miroirs , orchestrated 1918 ) and Le tombeau de Couperin ( 1914 – 17 , orchestrated 1919 ) . 
 Ravel was not by inclination a teacher , but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them . Manuel Rosenthal was one , and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent . Like his own teacher , Fauré , he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters . He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy 's music : " Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound . " When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s , Ravel , after serious consideration , refused , on the grounds that they " would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity " . The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams , who was his pupil for three months in 1907 – 08 . Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from " the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner ... Complexe mais pas <unk> was his motto . " 
 Vaughan Williams 's recollections throw some light on Ravel 's private life , about which the latter 's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation . Vaughan Williams , Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels . Long attributed this to his self @-@ consciousness about his diminutive stature , and consequent lack of confidence with women . By other accounts , none of them first hand , Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards , or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan @-@ Morhange . Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel , a lifelong bachelor , may have been homosexual . Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry ; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel 's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery . 
 Ravel 's first concert outside France was in 1909 . As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses , he visited London , where he played for the Société des Concerts Français , gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation . 
 = = = 1910 to First World War = = = 
 The Société Nationale de Musique , founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers , had been dominated since the mid @-@ 1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d 'Indy . Ravel , together with several other former pupils of Fauré , set up a new , modernist organisation , the Société Musicale <unk> , with Fauré as its president . The new society 's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910 ; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré 's song cycle La chanson d 'Ève , Debussy 's piano suite D 'un <unk> d <unk> , Zoltán Kodály 's Six pièces pour piano , and the original piano duet version of Ravel 's Ma mère l 'Oye . The performers included Fauré , Florent Schmitt , Ernest Bloch , Pierre Monteux and , in the Debussy work , Ravel . Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel 's new influence that the society featured Satie 's music in a concert in January 1911 . 
 The first of Ravel 's two operas , the one @-@ act comedy L 'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911 . The work had been completed in 1907 , but the manager of the Opéra @-@ Comique , Albert Carré , repeatedly deferred its presentation . He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra @-@ respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Opéra @-@ Comique 's audience . The piece was only modestly successful at its first production , and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular . 
 In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered . The first , to the orchestrated and expanded version of Ma mère l 'Oye , opened at the Théâtre des Arts in January . The reviews were excellent : the Mercure de France called the score " absolutely ravishing , a masterwork in miniature " . The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire ; it was played at the Queen 's Hall , London , within weeks of the Paris premiere , and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year . The Times praised " the enchantment of the work ... the effect of mirage , by which something quite real seems to float on nothing . " New York audiences heard the work in the same year . Ravel 's second ballet of 1912 was Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs , danced to the score of Valses nobles et sentimentales , which opened at the Châtelet in April . Daphnis et Chloé opened at the same theatre in June . This was his largest @-@ scale orchestral work , and took him immense trouble and several years to complete . 
 Daphnis et Chloé was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company , the Ballets Russes . Ravel began work with Diaghilev 's choreographer , Michel Fokine , and designer , Léon Bakst . Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance , with individual numbers replaced by continuous music . This appealed to Ravel , and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine , Ravel began composing the music . There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators , and the premiere was under @-@ rehearsed because of the late completion of the work . It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn , although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London . The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel 's health ; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere . 
 Ravel composed little during 1913 . He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky 's unfinished opera Khovanshchina , and his own works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble , and two short piano pieces , À la manière de <unk> and À la manière de Chabrier . In 1913 , together with Debussy , Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring . Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music . Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande .

 When Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the French Air Force . He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator , but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint . After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist , Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915 , when he was forty . Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend 's courage : " at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place , or done nothing " . Some of Ravel 's duties put him in mortal danger , driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment . At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother 's failing health . His own health also deteriorated ; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems , underwent a bowel operation following amoebic dysentery in September 1916 , and had frostbite in his feet the following winter . 
 During the war , the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française was formed by Saint @-@ Saëns , Dubois , d 'Indy and others , campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music . Ravel declined to join , telling the committee of the league in 1916 , " It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues , and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie : our musical art , which is so rich at the present time , would soon degenerate , becoming isolated in banal formulas . " The league responded by banning Ravel 's music from its concerts . 
 Ravel 's mother died in January 1917 , and he fell into a " horrible despair " , compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war . He composed few works in the war years . The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began , and the most substantial of his wartime works is Le tombeau de Couperin , composed between 1914 and 1917 . The suite celebrates the tradition of François Couperin , the 18th @-@ century French composer ; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel 's who died in the war .

 After the war those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina . As the musicologist Stephen <unk> puts it , " Ravel 's emotional equilibrium , so hard won in the previous decade , had been seriously compromised " . His output , never large , became smaller . Nonetheless , after the death of Debussy in 1918 , he was generally seen , in France and abroad , as the leading French composer of the era . Fauré wrote to him , " I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly . It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor . " Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920 , and though he declined the decoration he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie 's protégés Les Six as an establishment figure . Satie had turned against him , and commented , " Ravel refuses the Légion d 'honneur , but all his music accepts it . " Despite this attack , Ravel continued to admire Satie 's early music , and always acknowledged the older man 's influence on his own development . Ravel took a benign view of Les Six , promoting their music , and defending it against journalistic attacks . He regarded their reaction against his works as natural , and preferable to their copying his style . Through the Société Musicale <unk> , he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries . The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland , Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott . 
 Orenstein and <unk> both comment that , although Ravel 's post @-@ war output was small , averaging only one composition a year , it included some of his finest works . In 1920 he completed La valse , in response to a commission from Diaghilev . He had worked on it intermittently for some years , planning a concert piece , " a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz , mingled with , in my mind , the impression of a fantastic , fatal whirling " . It was rejected by Diaghilev , who said , " It 's a masterpiece , but it 's not a ballet . It 's the portrait of a ballet " . Ravel heard Diaghilev 's verdict without protest or argument , left , and had no further dealings with him . Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died . A ballet danced to the orchestral version of Le tombeau de Couperin was given at the Théâtre des Champs @-@ Elysées in November 1920 , and the premiere of La valse followed in December . The following year Daphnis et Chloé and L 'heure espagnole were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra . 
 In the post @-@ war era there was a reaction against the large @-@ scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss . Stravinsky , whose Rite of Spring was written for a huge orchestra , began to work on a much smaller scale . His 1923 ballet score Les noces is composed for voices and twenty @-@ one instruments . Ravel did not like the work ( his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky 's friendship with him ) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for " <unk> " – the " stripping away " of pre @-@ war extravagance to reveal the essentials . Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces . Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality . Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés , and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work . Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera , and its influence is heard in his later music . Arnold Schönberg 's abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel 's music such as the Chansons <unk> ( 1926 ) , which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of Pierrot Lunaire . His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky 's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition ( 1922 ) , the opera L 'enfant et les sortilèges to a libretto by Colette ( 1926 ) , Tzigane ( 1924 ) and the Violin Sonata ( 1927 ) . 
 Finding city life fatiguing , Ravel moved to the country . In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belvédère , a small house on the fringe of Montfort @-@ l 'Amaury , 88 kilometres ( 55 mi ) west of Paris , in the Yvelines département . Looked after by a devoted housekeeper , Mme <unk> , he lived there for the rest of his life . At Le Belvédère Ravel composed and gardened , when not performing in Paris or abroad . His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s , with concerts in Britain , Italy , Sweden , Denmark , the US , Canada , Spain and Austria . 
 After two months of planning Ravel made a four @-@ month tour of North America in 1928 , playing and conducting . His fee was a guaranteed minimum of $ 10 @,@ 000 and a constant supply of <unk> cigarettes . He appeared with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty @-@ five cities . Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary . At an all @-@ Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat . Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed , " You know , this doesn 't happen to me in Paris . " Orenstein , commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel 's international reputation , lists its non @-@ musical highlights as a visit to Poe 's house in New York , and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon . Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity . He commented that the critics ' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment , when they called him " the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion " . 
 The last work Ravel completed in the 1920s became his most famous : Boléro . He was commissioned to provide a score for Ida Rubinstein 's ballet company , and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate Albéniz 's Iberia he decided on " an experiment in a very special and limited direction ... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music . " Ravel continued that the work was " one long , very gradual crescendo . There are no contrasts , and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution . The themes are altogether impersonal " . He was astonished , and not wholly pleased , that it became a mass success . When one elderly member of the audience at the Opéra shouted " Rubbish ! " at the premiere he remarked , " That old lady got the message ! " The work was popularised by the conductor Arturo Toscanini , and has been recorded several hundred times . Ravel commented to Arthur Honegger , one of Les Six , " I 've written only one masterpiece – Boléro . Unfortunately there 's no music in it . " 
 = = = Last years = = = 
 At the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos . He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first . It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein , who had lost his right arm during the war . Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project : " In a work of this kind , it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands . " Ravel , not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand , demonstrated it with both hands . Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece , but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work . In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim , and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year . The critic Henry <unk> wrote , " From the opening measures , we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us . " 
 The Piano Concerto in G major was completed a year later . After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist , Marguerite Long , and for Ravel 's score , though not for his conducting . Long , the dedicatee , played the concerto in more than twenty European cities , with the composer conducting ; they planned to record it together , but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted . 
 In October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident . The injury was not thought serious at the time , but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition . As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel 's growing absent @-@ mindedness , and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia . Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film , Don Quixote ( 1933 ) , but he was unable to meet the production schedule , and Jacques <unk> wrote most of the score . Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film ; they were published as Don Quichotte à <unk> . The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel 's hand , but Lucien <unk> and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription . Ravel composed no more after this . The exact nature of his illness is unknown . Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour , and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia , Alzheimer 's disease and Creutzfeldt @-@ Jakob disease . Though no longer able to write music or perform , Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months . Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head . 
 In 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition , and was examined by Clovis Vincent , a well @-@ known Paris neurosurgeon . Vincent advised surgical treatment . He thought a tumour unlikely , and expected to find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing . Ravel 's brother Edouard accepted this advice ; as Henson comments , the patient was in no state to express a considered view . After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition , but it was short @-@ lived , and he soon lapsed into a coma . He died on 28 December , at the age of 62 . 
 On 30 December 1937 Ravel was buried next to his parents in a granite tomb at the cemetery at Levallois @-@ Perret , a suburb of northwest Paris . Ravel was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony . 
 = = Music = = 
 Marcel <unk> 's catalogue of Ravel 's complete works lists eighty @-@ five works , including many incomplete or abandoned . Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries , it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel 's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra . The performable body of works numbers about sixty ; slightly more than half are instrumental . Ravel 's music includes pieces for piano , chamber music , two piano concerti , ballet music , opera , and song cycles . He wrote no symphonies or religious works . 
 Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy . Foreign influences include Mozart , Schubert , Liszt and Chopin . He considered himself in many ways a classicist , often using traditional structures and forms , such as the ternary , to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies . The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata . 
 Ravel placed high importance on melody , telling Vaughan Williams that there is " an implied melodic outline in all vital music " . His themes are frequently modal instead of using the familiar major or minor scales . As a result , there are few leading notes in his output . Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas , such as those in the Valses nobles et sentimentales , are characteristic of Ravel 's harmonic language . 
 Dance forms appealed to Ravel , most famously the bolero and <unk> , but also the minuet , <unk> , <unk> , waltz , <unk> , habanera and passacaglia . National and regional consciousness was important to him , and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised , his works include allusions to Hebraic , Greek , Hungarian and gypsy themes . He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin , Chabrier , Fauré and Haydn , interpreting their characteristics in a <unk> style . Another important influence was literary rather than musical : Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that " true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion " , with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude . 
 = = = Operas = = = 
 Ravel completed two operas , and worked on three others . The unrealised three were Olympia , La cloche <unk> and Jeanne d 'Arc . Olympia was to be based on Hoffmann 's The Sandman ; he made sketches for it in 1898 – 99 , but did not progress far . La cloche <unk> after Hauptmann 's The Sunken Bell occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912 , Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works , except for a " Symphonie <unk> " which he incorporated into the opening of L 'heure espagnole . The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph <unk> 's 1925 novel about Joan of Arc . It was to be a large @-@ scale , full @-@ length work for the Paris Opéra , but Ravel 's final illness prevented him from writing it . 
 Ravel 's first completed opera was L 'heure espagnole ( premiered in 1911 ) , described as a " comédie musicale " . It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career . Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra , which the composer considered " perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects " . Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel 's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work , " giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action " , and " commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage . " Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity . The critic David Murray writes that the score " glows with the famous Ravel <unk> " . 
 The second opera , also in one act , is L 'enfant et les sortilèges ( 1926 ) , a " fantaisie lyrique " to a libretto by Colette . She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet , but at the composer 's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto . It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L 'heure espagnole , and the jazz elements and bitonality of much of the work upset many Parisian opera @-@ goers . Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion , but Nichols finds " profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work " . The score presents an impression of simplicity , disguising intricate links between themes , with , in Murray 's phrase , " extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout " . 
 Although one @-@ act operas are generally staged less often than full @-@ length ones , Ravel 's are produced regularly in France and abroad . For 2013 – 15 Operabase records eight productions around the world of L 'heure espagnole and twenty @-@ four of L 'enfant et les sortilèges . 
 = = = Other vocal works = = = 
 A substantial proportion of Ravel 's output was vocal . His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome . His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy 's influence , in what Kelly describes as " a static , recitative @-@ like vocal style " , prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility . By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural , sometimes colloquial , setting of the French language in Histoires naturelles . The same technique is highlighted in Trois poèmes de Stéphane Mallarmé ( 1913 ) ; Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel , and the former 's word @-@ setting is noticeably more formal than the latter 's , in which syllables are often elided . In the cycles Shéhérazade and Chansons <unk> Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic , even the sensual , in both the vocal line and the accompaniment . 
 Ravel 's songs often draw on vernacular styles , using elements of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires <unk> , Deux mélodies <unk> and Chants populaires . Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot , Léon @-@ Paul <unk> , Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine . For three songs dating from 1914 – 15 he wrote his own texts . 
 Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices , he is chiefly associated , in his songs , with the soprano and mezzo @-@ soprano voices . Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man , he often favoured a female voice , and he seems to have preferred his best @-@ known cycle , Shéhérazade , to be sung by a woman , although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score . 
 = = = Orchestral works = = = 
 During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous . He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential , putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use . The critic Alexis Roland @-@ Manuel wrote , " In reality he is , with Stravinsky , the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone @-@ note , the harmonics of a ' cello or a pp tam @-@ tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another . " 
 For all Ravel 's orchestral mastery , only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra : Rapsodie espagnole , La valse and the two concertos . All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage , as in Daphnis et Chloé , or as a reworking of piano pieces , Alborada del gracioso and Une barque sur l <unk> , ( Miroirs ) , Valses nobles et sentimentales , Ma mère l 'Oye , Tzigane ( originally for violin and piano ) and Le tombeau de Couperin . In the orchestral versions , the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms . Occasionally , as in the Alborada del gracioso , critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp @-@ edged piano original . 
 In some of his scores from the 1920s , including Daphnis et Chloé , Ravel frequently divides his upper strings , having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility . His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple @-@ forte outbursts at climactic points . In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures . The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint @-@ Saëns , alongside use of jazz @-@ like themes . The critics Edward Sackville @-@ West and Desmond Shawe @-@ Taylor comment that in the slow movement , " one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented " , the composer " can truly be said to join hands with Mozart " . The most popular of Ravel 's orchestral works , Boléro ( 1928 ) , was conceived several years before its completion ; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating " a symphonic poem without a subject , where the whole interest will be in the rhythm " . 
 Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann , Chabrier , Debussy and Mussorgsky 's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition . Orchestral versions of the last by Mikhail <unk> , Sir Henry Wood and Leo <unk> predated Ravel 's 1922 version , and many more have been made since , but Ravel 's remains the best known . Kelly remarks on its " dazzling array of instrumental colour " , and a contemporary reviewer commented on how , in dealing with another composer 's music , Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own . 
 = = = Piano music = = = 
 Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano , they exemplify his range ; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch " from the striking simplicity of Ma mère l 'Oye to the transcendental virtuosity of Gaspard de la nuit . " Ravel 's earliest major work for piano , Jeux d 'eau ( 1901 ) , is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy , whose major works for piano all came later . When writing for solo piano Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy , but sought a <unk> virtuosity . The authors of The Record Guide consider that works such as Gaspard de la Nuit and Miroirs have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration " in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself . " 
 Most of Ravel 's piano music is extremely difficult to play , and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges . Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013 , " A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing . It involves subtle musicianship , a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso ... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit . Too much temperament , and the music loses its classical shape ; too little , and it sounds pale . " This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes , who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit " Le <unk> " would " bore the audience to death " . Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over @-@ interpreting Ravel 's piano writing . 
 Ravel 's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works ; Menuet sur le nom de Haydn ( 1909 ) , À la manière de <unk> ( 1912 ) , À la manière de Chabrier ( 1913 ) and Le tombeau de Couperin all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically <unk> manner . Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions : " Listen to Le tombeau de Couperin and the complete ballet music for Ma mère L 'Oye in the classic recordings conducted by André Cluytens , and the piano versions never sound quite the same again . " 
 = = = Chamber music = = = 
 Apart from a one @-@ movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899 , unpublished in the composer 's lifetime , Ravel wrote seven chamber works . The earliest is the String Quartet ( 1902 – 03 ) , dedicated to Fauré , and showing the influence of Debussy 's quartet of ten years earlier . Like the Debussy it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers , with more succinct melodies , fluently interchanged , in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour . The Introduction and Allegro for harp , flute , clarinet , and string quartet ( 1905 ) was composed very quickly by Ravel 's standards . It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the Pavane pour une infante défunte . Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio ( 1914 ) to complete it before joining the French army . It contains Basque , Baroque and far Eastern influences , and shows Ravel 's growing technical skill , dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello , " blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own , " in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson . 
 Ravel 's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello ( 1920 – 22 ) , the " Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré " for violin and piano ( 1922 ) , the chamber original of Tzigane for violin and piano ( 1924 ) and finally the Violin Sonata ( 1923 – 27 ) . The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel 's teacher , and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist Jelly d <unk> . The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre @-@ war Piano Trio : the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career , with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody . His last chamber work , the Violin Sonata ( sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata ) , is a frequently dissonant work . Ravel said that the violin and piano are " essentially incompatible " instruments , and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility . Sackville @-@ West and Shawe @-@ Taylor consider the post @-@ war sonatas " rather laboured and unsatisfactory " , and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel 's pre @-@ war chamber works . 
 = = = Recordings = = = 
 Ravel 's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on piano roll between 1914 and 1928 , although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by Robert Casadesus , a better pianist . Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc . In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of Jeux d 'eau played by Mark <unk> , and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the Pavane pour une infante défunte and Ondine , and movements from the String Quartet , Le tombeau de Couperin and Ma mère l 'Oye . Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public , and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works , some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor . A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as " Conducted by the composer " , although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton . Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a Boléro in 1930 , and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist . 
 = = Honours and legacy = = 
 Ravel declined not only the Légion d 'honneur but all state honours from France , refusing to let his name go forward for election to the Institut de France . He accepted foreign awards , including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921 , the Belgian Ordre de Léopold in 1926 , and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928 . 
 After Ravel 's death his brother and legatee , Edouard , turned the composer 's house at Montfort @-@ l 'Amaury into a museum , leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it . As of 2016 the maison @-@ musée de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours . 
 In his later years Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer 's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music , but evidently changed his mind . After his death in 1960 the estate passed through several hands . Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel 's music , the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were . The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort @-@ l 'Amaury , which was in a poor state of repair .

 = New York State Route 284 = 
 New York State Route 284 ( NY 284 ) is a north – south state highway located entirely within Orange County , New York , in the United States . It begins just south of the village of Unionville at the New Jersey state line in the town of Minisink , where it connects to that state 's Route 284 . From Unionville , the route heads through rural parts of Orange County for just over 9 miles ( 14 km ) to an intersection with U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) in the hamlet of Slate Hill , located 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) southwest of the city of Middletown in the town of Wawayanda . 
 The highway has been part of a state route since 1924 when it became part of New York State Route 8 , a road continuing northeast through Middletown and Montgomery to Newburgh . NY 8 was split into two routes as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , with the portion of the highway south of Montgomery becoming New York State Route 84 . When Interstate 84 ( I @-@ 84 ) was built along a similar alignment to NY 84 in the mid @-@ 1960s , the state route was renumbered again in May 1966 to prevent confusion between the two roads . The section of NY 84 south of Slate Hill was redesignated as NY 284 while the rest of the highway was absorbed by other , pre @-@ existing routes . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 284 begins at the New Jersey state line in the town of Minisink as a northerly continuation of that state 's Route 284 . The route heads northwest for a short distance into the village of Unionville , where it serves as the main thoroughfare through the community . In the center of the village , the highway reaches an intersection with County Route 36 ( CR 36 , named Main Street ) , which heads west to the New Jersey state line and becomes CR 651 upon entering Sussex County . NY 284 turns north at this junction , passing a handful of homes before bending to the northwest and leaving the village limits for less developed areas of Minisink . 
 Outside of Unionville , the route slowly bends to the northeast , paralleling the former right @-@ of @-@ way of the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad ( <unk> ) as it runs northwest through farmlands . At the far eastern end of the hamlet of Waterloo Mills , the highway also begins to follow Rutgers Creek . The waterway , the former railroad right @-@ of @-@ way and the road take similar paths to the hamlet of Westtown , where NY 284 serves as the main north – south route through the community . It passes <unk> Pond in the southern part of the hamlet before meeting CR 1 near Art Fords Lake . Past Westtown , NY 284 winds its way northeastward across another rural part of Minisink , intersecting CR 62 and CR 22 at back @-@ to @-@ back junctions near the northern town line . The latter route provides access to the hamlet of Johnson , which NY 284 bypasses to the southeast . 
 North of CR 22 , Rutgers Creek merges with <unk> Creek , a small stream forming part of the Minisink – Wawayanda town line . The combined stream continues to serve as the boundary between the two towns as Rutgers Creek takes on a southeasterly course from this point . NY 284 crosses over the waterway , entering Wawayanda and connecting to CR 93 ( Lime Kiln Road ) just north of the town line . From CR 93 , the highway runs northeastward across open , rolling terrain , following an active part of the <unk> Railroad to the hamlet of Slate Hill . NY 284 ends in the center of the community at a junction with US 6 . 
 = = History = = 
 Modern NY 284 was gradually acquired by the state of New York over the course of the early 20th century . The first stretch to be added to the state highway system was the section between the northern village line of Unionville and the hamlet of Slate Hill , which was improved by the state under a contract awarded on June 18 , 1904 . Work to bring the existing highway up to state highway standards cost $ 50 @,@ 879 ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 34 million in 2016 ) , and the rebuilt road was taken over by the state on December 19 , 1906 . It was designated but not signed as State Highway 160 ( SH 160 ) . A contract to improve the highway 's continuation to the New Jersey state line south of Unionville was awarded on June 19 , 1922 , and the highway was reconstructed and taken over by the state by 1926 as SH 500 . 
 When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , SH 160 and SH 500 became the westernmost portion of NY 8 , which continued northeast to Newburgh by way of Middletown and Montgomery . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the NY 8 designation was reassigned to another highway serving the Central New York Region and the North Country . The portion of its former alignment east of Montgomery became part of the new NY 215 while the rest was renumbered to NY 84 . Another , much smaller renumbering was carried out in May 1966 after I @-@ 84 was built along an alignment similar to that of NY 84 . To prevent confusion between the two nearby roads , the section of NY 84 south of Slate Hill was renumbered to NY 284 while the part east of Middletown became an extension of NY 211 . From Slate Hill to Middletown , the road remained part of US 6 and NY 17M , which NY 84 had previously overlapped .

 The McDonnell Douglas A @-@ 4G Skyhawk is a variant of the Douglas A @-@ 4 Skyhawk attack aircraft developed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . The model was based on the A @-@ 4F variant of the Skyhawk , and was fitted with slightly different avionics as well as the capacity to operate AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder air @-@ to @-@ air missiles . The RAN received ten A @-@ 4Gs in 1967 and another ten in 1971 , and operated the type from 1967 to 1984 . 
 In Australian service the A @-@ 4Gs formed part of the air group of the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne , and were primarily used to provide air defence for the fleet . They took part in exercises throughout the Pacific region and also supported the training of RAN warships as well as other elements of the Australian military . The Skyhawks did not see combat , and a planned deployment of some of their pilots to fight in the Vietnam War was cancelled before it took place . Ten A @-@ 4Gs were destroyed as a result of equipment failures and non @-@ combat crashes during the type 's service with the Navy , causing the deaths of two pilots . 
 The RAN had no need for most of its fixed @-@ wing aircraft after Melbourne was decommissioned in 1982 , and the ten remaining A @-@ 4Gs were sold to the Royal New Zealand Air Force ( RNZAF ) in 1984 where they were initially used for training purposes . Between 1986 and 1991 these aircraft were upgraded and re @-@ designated A @-@ 4Ks . Two of the former A @-@ 4Gs crashed during 2001 , resulting in the death of a pilot . The RNZAF 's Skyhawks were retired in 2001 . Eight A @-@ 4Ks , including six former A @-@ 4Gs , were sold to Draken International in 2012 and are in service supporting United States military training exercises .

 During the late 1950s the Australian Government and Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) considered options to replace the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne , and her air group . While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955 , the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) were becoming obsolete . It was believed that Melbourne was too small to operate more modern aircraft types , and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier . The Government judged that the cost of a new aircraft carrier was too high , especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force 's ( RAAF 's ) procurement programs at that time , and in November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed @-@ wing aircraft in 1963 . 
 As a result of intervention by the Minister for the Navy , Senator John Gorton , the Government eventually agreed to purchase new fixed @-@ wing aircraft . Gorton had served as a fighter pilot in World War II and had a strong interest in his portfolio . In 1961 Gorton convinced Cabinet to fund a program to reinvigorate the FAA , starting with the purchase of 27 Westland Wessex anti @-@ submarine helicopters . At this time it was planned to retain Melbourne as a helicopter carrier , but in mid @-@ 1963 the Government gave the Navy permission to retain the Sea Venoms and Gannets in service until at least 1967 . Minister for Defence Senator Shane <unk> rejected a proposal from the Navy to purchase an Essex @-@ class aircraft carrier from the United States Navy in June 1964 , and the next month Melbourne undertook flight trials with A @-@ 4 Skyhawks and Grumman S @-@ 2 Trackers during a visit to the major American base at Subic Bay in the Philippines . The Skyhawk was a particularly light and compact attack plane , with a wing small enough to not require a folding mechanism . American Trackers had previously flown off the carrier during exercises in 1957 , and the Royal Canadian Navy had successfully trialled Skyhawks from Melbourne 's sister ship HMCS Bonaventure . The trials conducted at Subic Bay went well , and confirmed that Melbourne would need only minor modifications to safely operate both types of aircraft . 
 In late 1964 the RAN sought the Government 's approval to upgrade Melbourne and purchase a force of 18 Skyhawks and 16 Trackers . The Skyhawks were intended to be used to provide air defence for the fleet as well as to attack warships and targets on land . While the Naval Board saw maritime strike as being a logical task for the FAA , the RAAF argued that the 24 General Dynamics F @-@ 111C aircraft it had ordered would be more effective in this role . Cabinet agreed to the proposal to modernise the carrier and acquire Trackers in November 1964 , but delayed a decision on the Skyhawks at that time . Following further lobbying and staff work by the Navy , the Government eventually agreed to purchase ten Skyhawks in early 1965 for a cost of £ 9 @.@ 2 million . This order comprised eight single @-@ seat fighter aircraft and a pair of two @-@ seat TA @-@ 4 Skyhawk trainers . These aircraft were the first newly built Skyhawks to be sold to a country other than the United States . 
 The Australian Skyhawks , which were designated the A @-@ 4G , were a variant of the A @-@ 4F Skyhawk . The A @-@ 4F was the final single @-@ seat version of the Skyhawk to be designed specifically for the US Navy , and first flew in 1966 ; 164 were eventually delivered . This variant had a more powerful engine than that fitted to earlier Skyhawks , as well as better protection against ground fire and a distinctive " hump " containing avionics , which earned it the nickname " Camel " . The main differences between the F and G variants were that the latter did not have an avionics hump and was fitted to operate AIM @-@ 9B Sidewinder air @-@ to @-@ air missiles . The A @-@ 4Gs also lacked the A @-@ 4F 's ability to operate guided air @-@ to @-@ ground weapons . The two @-@ seat TA @-@ 4G trainers were fitted with the same avionics and weapons as the single @-@ seat aircraft , but were unable to be operated from Melbourne as their flight characteristics meant that they could not safely take off from the ship in the event of a " bolter " landing . 
 The ten Skyhawks were delivered to the RAN during 1967 . The first A @-@ 4G test flight took place on 19 July that year , and the initial TA @-@ 4G first flew two days later . On 26 July an A @-@ 4G and a TA @-@ 4G were handed over to the RAN at a ceremony conducted at McDonnell Douglas ' factory at Long Beach , California . In October that year , Melbourne sailed to the United States to pick up the Skyhawks and Trackers , with the A @-@ 4s being embarked at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego . The carrier transported these aircraft back to Jervis Bay , New South Wales , from where they were unloaded and moved by road to the Navy 's air station at HMAS Albatross near Nowra . After completing this task Melbourne proceeded to Sydney to begin a refit that would prepare her to operate the new air group . 
 A further ten A @-@ 4Gs were purchased in 1969 . The aircraft were funded by cancelling plans to expand the Navy 's force of Oberon class submarines from six to eight boats ; this change was justified on the grounds that it would improve the effectiveness of the carrier and expand the FAA 's strike capabilities . As with the first order , this purchase comprised eight A @-@ 4Gs and two TA @-@ 4Gs . The Skyhawks were former US Navy A @-@ 4Fs , and were modified to A @-@ 4G standard before being delivered to Australia . These aircraft were collected from San Diego by HMAS Sydney in July 1971 , which delivered them to Jervis Bay the next month . 
 The Australian Skyhawks retained their US Navy serial numbers , but were also allocated shorter " buzz " numbers painted near their nose . The first batch of A @-@ 4Gs were allocated buzz numbers 882 to 889 , and the second batch were assigned 870 to 877 . The first two TA @-@ 4Gs were 880 and 881 , and the second pair 878 and 879 .

 = = = Royal Australian Navy = = = 
 RAN Skyhawk operations began in 1968 . On 10 January that year 805 Squadron was recommissioned at HMAS Albatross to operate the type from Melbourne . Skyhawk flight training started later that month , with six experienced pilots being instructed by a US Navy officer and two other Australian pilots who had previously been posted to the United States to qualify as instructors . Shortages of spare parts disrupted flying activities for much of the year , and the first course graduated in mid @-@ December 1968 rather than May as had been originally planned ; the shortages were largely the result of the US Navy prioritising deliveries to its forces fighting in Vietnam over the needs of the RAN . The A @-@ 4Gs first operated at sea in November 1968 , when they landed on board the British carrier HMS Hermes while she was visiting Australia . 
 The Australian Government considered deploying pilots from 805 Squadron to fight in Vietnam during 1967 and 1968 . On 12 May 1967 , the Naval Board recommended to the Government that six Skyhawk pilots and their ground crew be offered to the US Navy during May the next year after these personnel had completed their training on the new aircraft . This decision was motivated by a desire to keep the pilots gainfully occupied while Melbourne completed her refit , and would not involve deploying the A @-@ 4Gs as they lacked the weapons systems and avionics needed to counter North Vietnamese air defences . As part of the initial consideration of this option , the Minister for Air suggested that the Australian Skyhawks could be sent to Ubon Air Force Base in Thailand to relieve the CAC Sabre @-@ equipped No. 79 Squadron RAAF stationed there , but such a deployment was found to be impractical . The Government 's Defence Committee subsequently recommended that FAA fighter pilots be attached to a United States Marine Corps ( USMC ) unit stationed at Chu Lai Air Base and conduct combat missions over South Vietnam . While the USMC Skyhawk units frequently attacked targets in North Vietnam , the FAA aircrew were to be prohibited from joining these operations as the Government had previously decided to restrict Australia 's war effort to South Vietnam . This plan was announced by Prime Minister Harold Holt in October 1967 as part of a package of Australian reinforcements to the war effort in Vietnam . In the event , the deployment did not proceed as the delays to 805 Squadron 's initial Skyhawk conversion course meant that the pilots were not ready until after Melbourne re @-@ entered service . The Navy assessed that it would not be possible to both man a fighter squadron on the carrier and post pilots to Vietnam , and delaying the reactivation of Melbourne 's air group could lead to criticism of the Skyhawk acquisition . In February 1969 the Minister for Defence directed that no further consideration was to be given to sending naval fighter pilots to Vietnam . 
 724 Squadron , the RAN 's jet aircraft operational conversion unit , was also equipped with Skyhawks during 1968 . By December that year the squadron was operating a mixed fleet of TA @-@ 4G Skyhawks , de Havilland Sea Vampires and Sea Venoms from Albatross . The Skyhawk conversion courses conducted by this unit lasted for six months , and involved a total of about 110 hours of flying in TA @-@ 4Gs and A @-@ 4Gs . During this period pilots became familiar with flying the type and practised combat missions as well as air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling from other Skyhawks using buddy fuel tanks . They were also required to complete about 100 simulated carrier landings at Albatross before landing a Skyhawk on board Melbourne . 
 After Melbourne 's refit was completed , the ship put to sea with Skyhawks in 1969 . At this time her air group typically comprised four Skyhawks from 805 Squadron , six S @-@ 2 Trackers operated by 816 Squadron and eight of 817 Squadron 's Wessex anti @-@ submarine helicopters . The mix of aircraft carried varied from time to time . During the late 1960s and 1970s Melbourne made regular deployments throughout the Pacific region to exercise with the Royal Navy and US Navy . In May 1972 , 805 Squadron 's strength was increased to eight Skyhawks , and it temporarily operated with ten of the type during Exercise Kangaroo in May 1974 . A @-@ 4Gs were embarked on board the carrier when she visited the United Kingdom in 1977 to participate in the Jubilee Fleet Review , and one of the Skyhawks also took part in that year 's Royal International Air Tattoo . Melbourne underwent major refits between December 1970 and August 1971 , mid @-@ 1975 to June 1976 and from July 1978 to February 1979 . During the periods the carrier was under refit her air group operated from Albatross . Melbourne was the smallest carrier to regularly operate Skyhawks . 
 The A @-@ 4Gs operated in several roles while embarked on board Melbourne , and also took part in training exercises from air bases around Australia . While their main role was to provide air defence for the carrier and other warships using Sidewinder missiles and cannon , the Skyhawks lacked the manoeuvrability needed to be effective fighters , and had relatively poor performance at high altitude . The A @-@ 4Gs carried " dumb " bombs and rockets in the ground attack and maritime strike roles as they were unable to operate guided weapons . The aircraft could also be fitted with a D @-@ 704 buddy pod aerial refuelling system , which allowed them to refuel from one another in flight , as well as 150 or 300 gallon capacity drop tanks to extend their range . At this time the A @-@ 4Gs were the only Australian military aircraft capable of in @-@ flight refuelling . The Skyhawks ' long range and ability to carry a large weapons load meant that they proved more successful in air @-@ to @-@ ground roles than as air defence fighters . While 724 Squadron did not deploy on board the carrier , it took part in training exercises with other RAN units as well as elements of the Australian Army . A particularly important task for the squadron was supporting the work @-@ up of RAN warships by acting as targets ; in this role Skyhawks were often deployed to RAAF Base Laverton in Victoria and RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia . 724 Squadron also formed a Skyhawk @-@ equipped aerobatics team called the <unk> . 
 From the mid @-@ 1970s the RAN investigated options to replace Melbourne and her air group . During 1977 the Navy sought tenders for an aircraft carrier capable of operating Harrier Jump Jets and helicopters . In February 1982 the Australian Government reached an agreement to purchase HMS Invincible from Britain the following year . As a result of this deal , Melbourne was decommissioned on 30 June 1982 , followed by 805 and 816 Squadrons on 2 July . All of the remaining ten Skyhawks were assigned to 724 Squadron , which continued to operate from Albatross . The sale of Invincible to Australia was cancelled in mid @-@ 1982 as a result of the Falklands War , and in March 1983 the new Hawke Government decided to not replace Melbourne . In May that year the Government also announced that the disbandment of the FAA 's fixed @-@ wing force would be brought forward as the RAN no longer needed such aircraft . Six of the A @-@ 4Gs were taken out of service on 30 June 1983 , and the other four were retained for target towing , radar and weapon calibration duties , and other fleet support tasks . While some consideration was given to using the Skyhawks in the close air support role , it was decided to retire the type . The last Australian A @-@ 4G flights took place on 30 June 1984 . 
 = = = Royal New Zealand Air Force = = = 
 The Royal New Zealand Air Force ( RNZAF ) had purchased a fleet of 14 A @-@ 4K Skyhawks in 1970 . These aircraft were a variant of the A @-@ 4E , and were used mainly in the close air support role . By the early 1980s they were becoming outdated , and lacked the air @-@ to @-@ air and advanced air @-@ to @-@ ground capabilities identified as requirements for the RNZAF in the 1983 Defence Review . Two of the A @-@ 4Ks had been destroyed in flying accidents and the remaining twelve aircraft fleet was not considered a viable force . 
 During the early 1980s the RNZAF considered options to replace or upgrade its A @-@ 4Ks . A team of senior RNZAF personnel visited France , the United Kingdom and the United States to assess new aircraft , and the New Zealand Government released a tender in May 1982 seeking proposals to upgrade the Skyhawks . After the decision was made to disband the RAN 's fighter force , the Australian Government offered the ten surviving A @-@ 4Gs and spare parts for these aircraft to New Zealand for $ <unk> million . The Cabinet of New Zealand gave the RNZAF authority to begin formal discussions of this deal on 5 September 1983 . A team of Air Force personnel inspected the A @-@ 4Gs at Albatross in November that year and judged that they were in generally good condition . The commander of the RNZAF , Air Vice @-@ Marshal David Crooks , favoured purchasing the A @-@ 4Gs and then upgrading the entire A @-@ 4 fleet over the alternative of buying new aircraft , as this option was the cheapest way to improve the Air Force 's capabilities . He recommended to Prime Minister Rob Muldoon that the deal be taken up , and a decision to acquire the aircraft was made in May 1984 . As part of the purchase agreement , the New Zealand Government committed to return one of the Skyhawks to Australia for display after the type was retired from service . 
 The eight A @-@ 4Gs and two TA @-@ 4Gs were ferried from Nowra to RNZAF Base <unk> in three groups from July 1984 . While they received minor modifications ( at a total cost of $ <unk> million ) and new serial numbers before entering service with the RNZAF , the aircraft retained the A @-@ 4G designation at this time . All of the A @-@ 4Gs were initially assigned to No. 2 Squadron RNZAF , which was reformed on 11 December 1984 as an operational conversion and training unit . The spare parts sold with the A @-@ 4Gs greatly increased the RNZAF 's stocks , and were calculated to be worth about $ <unk> million at commercial rates . 
 In order to address the shortcomings of the RNZAF 's Skyhawk fleet , the New Zealand Government approved the Project Kahu program in May 1985 . This project had a total cost of NZ $ 140 million , and primarily involved upgrading the A @-@ 4G and A @-@ 4Ks ' avionics to almost the standard of those fitted to the modern General Dynamics F @-@ 16C Fighting Falcon . The Skyhawks also received new wings drawn from the stock of spare parts purchased from the RAN in 1984 . Work began on the first aircraft in 1986 , and the program was completed in 1991 . After receiving the Kahu upgrade package the A @-@ 4Gs were re @-@ designated A @-@ 4Ks . 
 From 1990 until 2001 , No. 2 Squadron was stationed at HMAS Albatross , where it operated four A @-@ 4Ks and two TA @-@ 4Ks and trained alongside the Australian Defence Force ; several former Australian aircraft were among those serving with No. 2 Squadron during this period . The RNZAF continued to operate Skyhawks until 13 December 2001 , when both of its fighter squadrons were disbanded . In 2012 eight of the A @-@ 4Ks were sold to Draken International to provide training support for the US military ; six of these aircraft were former A @-@ 4Gs . The remaining nine A @-@ 4Ks were donated to museums .

 In April 2011 , the New Zealand Government returned TA @-@ 4K N13 @-@ <unk> ( 880 in RAN service and <unk> in RNZAF service ) to Australia . The Skyhawk had served with 724 Squadron from 1967 until 1984 , and was flown back to Australia in April 2012 within one of the RAAF 's Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III transports . This aircraft is currently displayed at the RAN 's Fleet Air Arm Museum . Since November 1999 a former American A @-@ 4B ( <unk> ) was first displayed as A @-@ 4G 885 ( <unk> ) and from 2007 as A @-@ 4G 882 ( <unk> ) at this museum . 
 = = Accidents and incidents = = 
 Ten of the twenty A @-@ 4Gs were lost during the type 's service with the RAN . This gave the Skyhawk a poor safety record , but the high loss rate was at least partially attributable to the intrinsic dangers involved in operating from an aircraft carrier . Two pilots were killed in these accidents . 
 Four Skyhawks were destroyed in accidents during the mid @-@ 1970s . The first A @-@ 4G to be lost was 873 , which crashed into the sea off Williamtown , New South Wales , on 5 June 1973 due to an engine failure ; its pilot ejected and was rescued by a RAAF helicopter . On 8 November that year Melbourne suffered a catapult failure while launching 889 near Singapore , and the aircraft landed in the sea in front of the carrier . While Melbourne sailed directly over the downed Skyhawk , its pilot managed to free himself and was picked up by a helicopter . The next loss took place on 16 May 1974 when TA @-@ 4G 879 crashed into the sea while conducting a practice attack on Melbourne off the south coast of New South Wales , killing the pilot . On 16 May the next year A @-@ 4Gs 870 and 872 collided while flying near Jervis Bay ; 872 crashed , resulting in the death of its pilot , but 870 managed to return to Albatross . 
 The other six A @-@ 4G losses occurred during 1979 and 1980 . On 23 January 1979 , 870 suffered an in @-@ flight turbine failure and crashed near Braidwood , New South Wales ; its pilot was rescued by a RAAF helicopter . On 23 May that year 888 ran off the flight deck of Melbourne after an arrester wire snapped during a landing near Jervis Bay . Its pilot , a US Navy exchange officer , survived . On 24 September 1979 , 886 rolled over the side of the carrier while being moved along the flight deck in heavy seas ; an FAA ground crewman who was sitting in the cockpit at the time managed to escape after the aircraft hit the water and was rescued by the destroyer HMAS Hobart . The next loss occurred on 28 April 1980 when the engine of TA @-@ 4G 878 failed while it was preparing to land at HMAS Albatross . The pilot of this aircraft ejected safely and was rescued by a RAN helicopter . On 2 October that year the A @-@ 4G 875 crashed into the sea near Sumatra , when its engine failed while being launched from Melbourne ; its pilot ejected and was rescued . The final loss occurred on 21 October 1980 , when 885 crashed into the sea as a result of a catapult failure ; the pilot was picked up by a Wessex . 
 Two of the former A @-@ 4Gs were also lost during their service with the RNZAF . On 16 February 2001 , <unk> ( 882 in Australian service ) crashed near Nowra while practising an aerobatic manoeuvre with another Skyhawk ; its pilot , who was also the commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron , was killed instantly . The last former A @-@ 4G to be lost was TA @-@ 4K <unk> ( the former 881 ) , which crashed into the Indian Ocean off Perth , Western Australia on 20 March 2001 . Its pilot ejected and survived .

 The song thrush ( Turdus philomelos ) is a thrush that breeds across much of Eurasia . It has brown upperparts and black @-@ spotted cream or buff underparts and has three recognised subspecies . Its distinctive song , which has repeated musical phrases , has frequently been referred to in poetry . 
 The song thrush breeds in forests , gardens and parks , and is partially migratory with many birds wintering in southern Europe , North Africa and the Middle East ; it has also been introduced into New Zealand and Australia . Although it is not threatened globally , there have been serious population declines in parts of Europe , possibly due to changes in farming practices . 
 The song thrush builds a neat mud @-@ lined cup nest in a bush or tree and lays four or five dark @-@ spotted blue eggs . It is omnivorous and has the habit of using a favourite stone as an " anvil " on which to break open the shells of snails . Like other perching birds ( passerines ) , it is affected by external and internal parasites and is vulnerable to predation by cats and birds of prey . 
 = = Taxonomy and systematics = = 
 = = = Name = = = 
 The song thrush was described by German ornithologist Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831 , and still bears its original scientific name , Turdus philomelos . The generic name , Turdus , is the Latin for thrush , and the specific epithet refers to a character in Greek mythology , Philomela , who had her tongue cut out , but was changed into a singing bird . Her name is derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> <unk> ( loving ) , and <unk> <unk> ( song ) . The dialect names throstle and mavis both mean thrush , being related to the German <unk> and French <unk> respectively . Throstle dates back to at least the fourteenth century and was used by Chaucer in the Parliament of Fowls . Mavis is derived via Middle English <unk> and Old French <unk> from Middle Breton <unk> meaning " thrush . " Mavis ( <unk> ) can also mean " purple " in Greek . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 A recent molecular study indicates that the song thrush 's closest relatives are the similarly plumaged mistle thrush ( T. viscivorus ) and Chinese thrush ( T. <unk> ) ; these three species are early offshoots from the lineage of Turdus thrushes before they diversified and spread across the globe , and hence are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird ( T. merula ) . 
 The song thrush has three subspecies , with the nominate subspecies , T. p. philomelos , covering the majority of the species ' range . T. p. hebridensis , described by British ornithologist William Eagle Clarke in 1913 , is a mainly sedentary ( non @-@ migratory ) form found in the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye in Scotland . It is the darkest subspecies , with a dark brown back , greyish rump , pale buff background colour to the underparts and grey @-@ tinged flanks . 
 T. p. clarkei , described by German zoologist Ernst Hartert in 1909 , and named for William Eagle Clarke , breeds in the rest of Great Britain and Ireland and on mainland Europe in France , Belgium , the Netherlands and possibly somewhat further east . It has brown upperparts which are warmer in tone than those of the nominate form , an olive @-@ tinged rump and rich yellow background colour to the underparts . It is a partial migrant with some birds wintering in southern France and Iberia . This form intergrades with the nominate subspecies in central Europe , and with T. p. hebridensis in the Inner Hebrides and western Scotland , and in these areas birds show intermediate characteristics . Additional subspecies , such as T. p. <unk> of Siberia , proposed by the Russian Sergei Buturlin in 1929 , are not widely accepted . 
 = = Description = = 
 The song thrush ( as represented by the nominate subspecies T. p. philomelos ) is 20 to 23 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 8 to 9 @.@ 25 in ) in length and weighs 50 – 107 grammes ( 1 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 8 oz ) . The sexes are similar , with plain brown backs and neatly black @-@ spotted cream or yellow @-@ buff underparts , becoming paler on the belly . The underwing is warm yellow , the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink . The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia . The juvenile resembles the adult , but has buff or orange streaks on the back and wing coverts . 
 The most similar European thrush species is the redwing ( T. <unk> ) , but that bird has a strong white supercilium , red flanks , and shows a red underwing in flight . The mistle thrush ( T. viscivorus ) is much larger and has white tail corners , and the Chinese thrush ( T. <unk> ) , although much more similar in plumage , has black face markings and does not overlap in range . 
 The song thrush has a short , sharp <unk> call , replaced on migration by a thin high seep , similar to the redwing 's call but shorter . The alarm call is a chook @-@ chook becoming shorter and more strident with increasing danger . The male 's song , given from trees , rooftops or other elevated perches , is a loud clear run of musical phrases , repeated two to four times , filip filip filip <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tereret tereret tereret , and interspersed with grating notes and mimicry . It is given mainly from February to June by the Outer Hebridean race , but from November to July by the more widespread subspecies . For its weight , this species has one of the loudest bird calls . 
 An individual male may have a repertoire of more than 100 phrases , many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds . Mimicry may include the imitation of man @-@ made items like telephones , and the song thrush will also repeat the calls of captive birds , including exotics such as the white @-@ faced whistling duck . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The song thrush breeds in most of Europe ( although not in the greater part of Iberia , lowland Italy or southern Greece ) , and across the Ukraine and Russia almost to Lake Baikal . It reaches to 75 ° N in Norway , but only to about 60 ° N in Siberia . Birds from Scandinavia , Eastern Europe and Russia winter around the Mediterranean , North Africa and the Middle East , but only some of the birds in the milder west of the breeding range leave their breeding areas . 
 Birds of the nominate subspecies were introduced to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880 , apparently for purely sentimental reasons . In New Zealand , where it was introduced on both the main islands , the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the <unk> , Chatham and Auckland Islands . Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand , in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne . In New Zealand , there appears to be a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species , and the song thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country . As an introduced species it has no legal protection in New Zealand , and can be killed at any time . 
 The song thrush typically nests in forest with good undergrowth and nearby more open areas , and in western Europe also uses gardens and parks . It breeds up to the tree @-@ line , reaching 2 @,@ 200 metres ( 7 @,@ 250 ft ) in Switzerland . The island subspecies T. p. hebridensis breeds in more open country , including heathland , and in the east of the song thrush 's Eurasian range , the nominate subspecies is restricted to the edge of the dense conifer forests . 
 In intensively farmed areas where agricultural practices appear to have made cropped land unsuitable , gardens are an important breeding habitat . In one English study , only 3 @.@ 5 % of territories were found in farmland , whereas gardens held 71 @.@ 5 % of the territories , despite that habitat making up only 2 % of the total area . The remaining nests were in woodlands ( 1 % of total area ) . 
 The winter habitat is similar to that used for breeding , except that high ground and other exposed localities are avoided ; however , the island subspecies T. p. hebridensis will frequent the seashore in winter . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 The song thrush is not usually gregarious , although several birds may roost together in winter or be loosely associated in suitable feeding habitats , perhaps with other thrushes such as the blackbird , fieldfare , redwing and dark @-@ throated thrush . Unlike the more nomadic fieldfare and redwing , the song thrush tends to return regularly to the same wintering areas . 
 This is a monogamous territorial species , and in areas where it is fully migratory , the male re @-@ establishes its breeding territory and starts singing as soon as he returns . In the milder areas where some birds stay year round , the resident male remains in his breeding territory , singing intermittently , but the female may establish a separate individual wintering range until pair formation begins in the early spring . 
 During migration , the song thrush travels mainly at night with a strong and direct flight action . It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short crossings ( as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds ) , and calls frequently to maintain contact . Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range , but the majority of birds , with shorter distances to cover , head south from September to mid @-@ December . However , hard weather may force further movement . Return migration varies between mid @-@ February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia . Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland , various Atlantic islands , and West Africa . 
 = = = Breeding and survival = = = 
 The female song thrush builds a neat cup @-@ shaped nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush , tree or creeper , or , in the case of the Hebridean subspecies , on the ground . She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple ; they are typically 2 @.@ 7 x 2 @.@ 0 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 79 x 1 @.@ 06 in ) in size and weigh 6 @.@ 0 grammes ( 0 @.@ 21 oz ) , of which 6 % is shell . The female incubates the eggs alone for 10 – 17 days , and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge . Two or three broods in a year is normal , although only one may be raised in the north of the range . On average , 54 @.@ 6 % of British juveniles survive the first year of life , and the adult annual survival rate is 62 @.@ 2 % . The typical lifespan is three years , but the maximum recorded age is 10 years 8 months . The song thrush is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos , such as the common cuckoo , but this is very rare because the thrush recognizes the cuckoo 's non @-@ mimetic eggs . However , the song thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult cuckoo that is shown by the blackbird . The introduced birds in New Zealand , where the cuckoo does not occur , have , over the past 130 years , retained the ability to recognise and reject non @-@ mimetic eggs . 
 Adult birds may be killed by cats , little owls and sparrowhawks , and eggs and nestlings are taken by magpies , jays , and , where present , grey squirrels . As with other passerine birds , parasites are common , and include endoparasites , such as the nematode <unk> ( <unk> ) mavis whose specific name mavis derives from this thrush . A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the fieldfares , redwings and song thrushes sampled carried <unk> , particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma . Ixodes ticks are also common , and can carry pathogens , including tick @-@ borne encephalitis in forested areas of central and eastern Europe and Russia , and , more widely , Borrelia bacteria . Some species of Borrelia cause Lyme disease , and ground @-@ feeding birds like the song thrush may act as a reservoir for the disease . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The song thrush is omnivorous , eating a wide range of invertebrates , especially earthworms and snails , as well as soft fruit and berries . Like its relative , the blackbird , the song thrush finds animal prey by sight , has a run @-@ and @-@ stop hunting technique on open ground , and will rummage through leaf @-@ litter seeking potential food items . 
 Land snails are an especially important food item when drought or hard weather makes it difficult to find other food . The thrush often uses a favourite stone as an " anvil " on which to break the shell of the snail before extracting the soft body and invariably wiping it on the ground before consumption . Young birds initially flick objects and attempt to play with them until they learn to use anvils as tools to smash snails . The nestlings are mainly fed on animal food such as worms , slugs , snails and insect larvae . 
 The grove Snail ( Cepaea nemoralis ) is regularly eaten by the song thrush , and its polymorphic shell patterns have been suggested as evolutionary responses to reduce predation ; however , song thrushes may not be the only selective force involved . 
 = = Status and conservation = = 
 The song thrush has an extensive range , estimated at 10 million square kilometres ( 3 @.@ 8 million square miles ) , and a large population , with an estimated 40 to 71 million individuals in Europe alone . 
 In the western Palaearctic , there is evidence of population decline , but at a level below the threshold required for global conservation concern ( i.e. , a reduction in numbers of more than 30 % in ten years or three generations ) and the IUCN Red List categorises this species as of " Least Concern " . In Great Britain and the Netherlands , there has been a more than 50 % decline in population and the song thrush is included in regional Red Lists . The decreases are greatest in farmlands ( 73 % since the mid @-@ 1970s ) and believed to be due to changes in agricultural practices in recent decades . The precise reasons for the decline are not known but may be related to the loss of hedgerows , a move to sowing crops in autumn rather than spring , and possibly the increased use of pesticides . These changes may have reduced the availability of food and of nest sites . In gardens , the use of poison bait to control slugs and snails may pose a threat and in urban areas , some thrushes are killed while using the hard surface of roads to smash snails . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 The song thrush 's characteristic song , with melodic phrases repeated twice or more , is described by the nineteenth @-@ century British poet Robert Browning in his poem Home Thoughts , from Abroad : 
 That 's the wise thrush ; he sings each song twice over , 
 Lest you should think he never could recapture 
 The first fine careless rapture ! 
 The song also inspired the nineteenth @-@ century British writer Thomas Hardy , who spoke in Darkling Thrush of the bird 's " full @-@ hearted song evensong / Of joy <unk> " , but twentieth @-@ century British poet Ted Hughes in Thrushes concentrated on its hunting prowess : " Nothing but bounce and / stab / and a ravening second " . Nineteenth @-@ century Welsh poet Edward Thomas wrote 15 poems concerning blackbirds or thrushes , including The Thrush : 
 I hear the thrush , and I see 
 Him alone at the end of the lane 
 Near the bare poplar 's tip , 
 Singing continuously . 
 In The Tables Turned , Romantic poet William Wordsworth references the song thrush , writing 
 Hark , how blithe the throstle sings 
 And he is no mean preacher 
 Come forth into the light of things 
 Let Nature be your teacher 
 The song thrush is the emblem of West Bromwich Albion Football Club , chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage . It also gave rise to Albion 's early nickname , The Throstles .

 Thrushes have been trapped for food from as far back as 12 @,@ 000 years ago and an early reference is found in the Odyssey : " Then , as doves or thrushes beating their spread wings against some snare rigged up in thickets — flying in for a cozy nest but a grisly bed receives them . " Hunting continues today around the Mediterranean , but is not believed to be a major factor in this species ' decline in parts of its range . 
 In Spain , this species is normally caught as it migrates through the country , often using birdlime which , although banned by the European Union , is still tolerated and permitted in the Valencian Community . In 2003 and 2004 the EU tried , but failed , to stop this practice in the Valencian region .

 Up to at least the nineteenth century the song thrush was kept as a cage bird because of its melodious voice . As with hunting , there is little evidence that the taking of wild birds for aviculture has had a significant effect on wild populations . 
 = Archaeopteryx = 
 Archaeopteryx ( / <unk> / ) , sometimes referred to by its German name <unk> ( " original bird " or " first bird " ) , is a genus of bird @-@ like dinosaurs that is transitional between non @-@ avian feathered dinosaurs and modern birds . The name derives from the ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " ancient " , and <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " feather " or " wing " . Between the late nineteenth century and the early twenty @-@ first century , Archaeopteryx had been generally accepted by palaeontologists and popular reference books as the oldest known bird ( member of the group Avialae ) . Older potential avialans have since been identified , including Anchiornis , Xiaotingia , and Aurornis . 
 Archaeopteryx lived in the Late Jurassic around 150 million years ago , in what is now southern Germany during a time when Europe was an archipelago of islands in a shallow warm tropical sea , much closer to the equator than it is now . Similar in size to a Eurasian magpie , with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven , the largest species of Archaeopteryx could grow to about 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 ft 8 in ) in length . Despite their small size , broad wings , and inferred ability to fly or glide , Archaeopteryx had more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than with modern birds . In particular , they shared the following features with the dromaeosaurids and troodontids : jaws with sharp teeth , three fingers with claws , a long bony tail , hyperextensible second toes ( " killing claw " ) , feathers ( which also suggest warm @-@ bloodedness ) , and various features of the skeleton . 
 These features make Archaeopteryx a clear candidate for a transitional fossil between non @-@ avian dinosaurs and birds . Thus , Archaeopteryx plays an important role , not only in the study of the origin of birds , but in the study of dinosaurs . It was named from a single feather in 1861 . That same year , the first complete specimen of Archaeopteryx was announced . Over the years , ten more fossils of Archaeopteryx have surfaced . Despite variation among these fossils , most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species , although this is still debated . 
 Most of these eleven fossils include impressions of feathers . Because these feathers are of an advanced form ( flight feathers ) , these fossils are evidence that the evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic . The type specimen of Archaeopteryx was discovered just two years after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species . Archaeopteryx seemed to confirm Darwin 's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds , the transitional fossils debate , and confirmation of evolution . 
 = = Description = = 
 Archaeopteryx lived during the early Tithonian stage of the Jurassic period , approximately 150 @.@ 8 – 148 @.@ 5 million years ago . Most of the specimens of Archaeopteryx that have been discovered come from the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria , southern Germany , which is a lagerstätte , a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils . 
 Archaeopteryx was roughly the size of a raven , with broad wings that were rounded at the ends and a long tail compared to its body length . It could reach up to 500 millimetres ( 20 in ) in body length , with an estimated mass of 0 @.@ 8 to 1 kilogram ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 2 lb ) . Archaeopteryx feathers , although less documented than its other features , were very similar in structure to modern @-@ day bird feathers . Despite the presence of numerous avian features , Archaeopteryx had many non @-@ avian theropod dinosaur characteristics . Unlike modern birds , Archaeopteryx had small teeth , as well as a long bony tail , features which Archaeopteryx shared with other dinosaurs of the time . 
 Because it displays features common to both birds and non @-@ avian dinosaurs , Archaeopteryx has often been considered a link between them . In the 1970s , John Ostrom , following T. H. Huxley 's lead in 1868 , argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx was a critical piece of evidence for this argument ; it had several avian features , such as a wishbone , flight feathers , wings , and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features . For instance , it has a long ascending process of the ankle bone , interdental plates , an obturator process of the ischium , and long chevrons in the tail . In particular , Ostrom found that Archaeopteryx was remarkably similar to the theropod family Dromaeosauridae . 
 = = = Plumage = = = 
 Specimens of Archaeopteryx were most notable for their well @-@ developed flight feathers . They were markedly asymmetrical and showed the structure of flight feathers in modern birds , with vanes given stability by a barb @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> arrangement . The tail feathers were less asymmetrical , again in line with the situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes . The thumb did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of stiff feathers . 
 The body plumage of Archaeopteryx is less well documented and has only been properly researched in the well @-@ preserved Berlin specimen . Thus , as more than one species seems to be involved , the research into the Berlin specimen 's feathers does not necessarily hold true for the rest of the species of Archaeopteryx . In the Berlin specimen , there are " trousers " of well @-@ developed feathers on the legs ; some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure , but are somewhat decomposed ( they lack barbicels as in ratites ) . In part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight . 
 A patch of pennaceous feathers is found running along its back , which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm , although not as stiff as the flight @-@ related feathers . Apart from that , the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of " proto @-@ down " not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur Sinosauropteryx : decomposed and fluffy , and possibly even appearing more like fur than feathers in life ( although not in their microscopic structure ) . These occur on the remainder of the body — although some feathers did not fossilize and others were obliterated during preparation , leaving bare patches on specimens — and the lower neck . 
 There is no indication of feathering on the upper neck and head . While these conceivably may have been nude , this may still be an artefact of preservation . It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea — the head and neck and the tail are generally bent downward , which suggests that the specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded , with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape ( death pose ) of the fossil specimens was achieved . This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose , which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment . So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial , the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off , while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained . 
 = = = = Colouration = = = = 
 In 2011 , graduate student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an Archaeopteryx specimen . Using scanning electron microscopy technology and energy @-@ dispersive X @-@ ray analysis , the team was able to detect the structure of melanosomes in the single @-@ feather specimen described in 1861 . The resultant structure was then compared to that of 87 modern bird species and was determined with a high percentage of likelihood to be black . The feather studied was most probably a single covert , which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings . The study does not mean that Archaeopteryx was entirely black , but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts . Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics , in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight . In a 2013 study published in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry , new analyses of Archaeopteryx 's feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex <unk> and dark @-@ coloured plumage , with only the tips of its flight feathers being primarily black . However , it was later shown that this interpretation was incorrect , and that the isolated feather was indeed matte black with a darker tip . 
 = = Palaeobiology = = 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 As in the wings of modern birds , the flight feathers of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad . This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation , but it is unclear whether Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider . The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier , but flight muscles might have attached to the thick , boomerang @-@ shaped wishbone , the <unk> coracoids , or perhaps , to a cartilaginous sternum . The sideways orientation of the glenoid ( shoulder ) joint between scapula , coracoid , and humerus — instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds — may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back , a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight . According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006 , Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do , but it may well have used a downstroke @-@ only flap @-@ assisted gliding technique . 
 Archaeopteryx wings were relatively large , which would have resulted in a low stall speed and reduced turning radius . The short and rounded shape of the wings would have increased drag , but also could have improved its ability to fly through cluttered environments such as trees and brush ( similar wing shapes are seen in birds that fly through trees and brush , such as crows and pheasants ) . The presence of " hind wings " , asymmetrical flight feathers stemming from the legs similar to those seen in dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor , also would have added to the aerial mobility of Archaeopteryx . The first detailed study of the hind wings by Longrich in 2006 , suggested that the structures formed up to 12 % of the total airfoil . This would have reduced stall speed by up to 6 % and turning radius by up to 12 % . 
 The feathers of Archaeopteryx were asymmetrical . This has been interpreted as evidence that it was a flyer , because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers . Some scientists , including Thomson and Speakman , have questioned this . They studied more than 70 families of living birds , and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers , and that the feathers of Archaeopteryx fall into this range . The degree of asymmetry seen in Archaeopteryx is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds . 
 In 2010 , Robert L. Nudds and Gareth J. Dyke in the journal Science published a paper in which they analysed the rachises of the primary feathers of Confuciusornis and Archaeopteryx . The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those of modern birds relative to body mass . The authors determined that Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis , were unable to use flapping flight . This study was criticized by Philip J. Currie and Luis Chiappe . Chiappe suggested that it is difficult to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers , and Currie speculated that Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis must have been able to fly to some degree , as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been marine or lake sediments , suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water . Gregory Paul also disagreed with the study , arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the masses of these early birds , and that more accurate mass estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises . Nudds and Dyke had assumed a mass of 250 g ( 8 @.@ 8 oz ) for the Munich specimen Archaeopteryx , a young juvenile , based on published mass estimates of larger specimens . Paul argued that a more reasonable body mass estimate for the Munich specimen is about 140 g ( 4 @.@ 9 oz ) . Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves , noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved . Nudds and Dyke reported a diameter of 0 @.@ 75 mm ( 0 @.@ 03 in ) for the longest primary feather , which Paul could not confirm using photographs . Paul measured some of the inner primary feathers , finding rachises 1 @.@ 25 – 1 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 049 – 0 @.@ 055 in ) across . Despite these criticisms , Nudds and Dyke stood by their original conclusions . They claimed that Paul 's statement , that an adult Archaeopteryx would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen , was dubious . This , they reasoned , would require an even thicker rachis , evidence for which has not yet been presented . Another possibility is that they had not achieved true flight , but instead used their wings as aids for extra lift while running over water after the fashion of the basilisk lizard , which could explain their presence in lake and marine deposits ( see Evolution of bird flight ) . 
 In 2004 , scientists analysing a detailed CT scan of the braincase of the London Archaeopteryx concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs , indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying . The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan . The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one @-@ third of the brain . Other well @-@ developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination . The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear . The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non @-@ avian reptiles . These characteristics taken together suggest that Archaeopteryx had the keen sense of hearing , balance , spatial perception , and coordination needed to fly . Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum @-@ to @-@ brain @-@ volume ratio 78 % of the way to modern birds from the condition of non @-@ coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus or Allosaurus , which had a crocodile @-@ like anatomy of the brain and inner ear . Newer research shows that while the Archaeopteryx brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods , it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs , even smaller than that of other non @-@ avian dinosaurs in several instances , which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade . 
 Recent studies of flight feather barb geometry reveal that modern birds possess a larger barb angle in the trailing vane of the feather , whereas Archaeopteryx lacks this large barb angle , indicating potentially weak flight abilities . 
 Archaeopteryx continues to play an important part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds . Some scientists see it as a semi @-@ arboreal climbing animal , following the idea that birds evolved from tree @-@ dwelling gliders ( the " trees down " hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by O. C. Marsh ) . Other scientists see Archaeopteryx as running quickly along the ground , supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running ( the " ground up " hypothesis proposed by Samuel Wendell Williston ) . Still others suggest that Archaeopteryx might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground , like modern crows , and this latter view is what currently is considered best @-@ supported by morphological characters . Altogether , it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching . A scenario outlined by Elżanowski in 2002 suggested that Archaeopteryx used its wings mainly to escape predators by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches , and alternatively , to cover longer distances ( mainly ) by gliding down from cliffs or treetops . 
 = = = Growth = = = 
 A histological study by Erickson , Norell , <unk> , and others in 2009 estimated that Archaeopteryx grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds , presumably because the outermost portions of Archaeopteryx bones appear poorly vascularized ; in living vertebrates poorly vascularized bone is correlated with slow growth rate . They also assume that all known skeletons of Archaeopteryx come from juvenile specimens . Because the bones of Archaeopteryx could not be histologically sectioned in a formal <unk> ( growth ring ) analysis , Erickson and colleagues used bone <unk> ( porosity ) to estimate bone growth rate . They assumed that poorly vascularized bone grows at similar rates in all birds and in Archaeopteryx . The poorly vascularized bone of Archaeopteryx might have grown as slowly as that in a mallard ( 2 @.@ 5 micrometres per day ) or as fast as that in an ostrich ( 4 @.@ 2 micrometres per day ) . Using this range of bone growth rates , they calculated how long it would take to " grow " each specimen of Archaeopteryx to the observed size ; it may have taken at least 970 days ( there were 375 days in a Late Jurassic year ) to reach an adult size of 0 @.@ 8 – 1 kg ( 1 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 2 lb ) . The study also found that the avialans <unk> and Sapeornis grew relatively slowly , as did the dromaeosaurid Mahakala . The avialans Confuciusornis and Ichthyornis grew relatively quickly , following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds . One of the few modern birds that exhibit slow growth is the flightless kiwi , and the authors speculated that Archaeopteryx and the kiwi had similar basal metabolic rate .

 The richness and diversity of the Solnhofen limestones in which all specimens of Archaeopteryx have been found have shed light on an ancient Jurassic Bavaria strikingly different from the present day . The latitude was similar to Florida , though the climate was likely to have been drier , as evidenced by fossils of plants with adaptations for arid conditions and a lack of terrestrial sediments characteristic of rivers . Evidence of plants , although scarce , include cycads and conifers while animals found include a large number of insects , small lizards , pterosaurs , and Compsognathus . 
 The excellent preservation of Archaeopteryx fossils and other terrestrial fossils found at Solnhofen indicates that they did not travel far before becoming preserved . The Archaeopteryx specimens found were therefore likely to have lived on the low islands surrounding the Solnhofen lagoon rather than to have been corpses that drifted in from farther away . Archaeopteryx skeletons are considerably less numerous in the deposits of Solnhofen than those of pterosaurs , of which seven genera have been found . The pterosaurs included species such as Rhamphorhynchus belonging to the <unk> , the group which dominated the niche currently occupied by seabirds , and which became extinct at the end of the Jurassic . The pterosaurs , which also included Pterodactylus , were common enough that it is unlikely that the specimens found are vagrants from the larger islands 50 km ( 31 mi ) to the north . 
 The islands that surrounded the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying , semi @-@ arid , and sub @-@ tropical with a long dry season and little rain . The closest modern analogue for the Solnhofen conditions is said to be Orca Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico , although it is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons . The flora of these islands was adapted to these dry conditions and consisted mostly of low ( 3 m ( 10 ft ) ) shrubs . Contrary to reconstructions of Archaeopteryx climbing large trees , these seem to have been mostly absent from the islands ; few trunks have been found in the sediments and fossilized tree pollen also is absent . 
 The lifestyle of Archaeopteryx is difficult to reconstruct and there are several theories regarding it . Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground , while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal . The absence of trees does not preclude Archaeopteryx from an arboreal lifestyle , as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs . Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an arboreal or ground existence , including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet ; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground , as well as along the shores of the lagoon . It most likely hunted small prey , seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough , or with its claws if it was larger . 
 = = History of discovery = = 
 Over the years , twelve body fossil specimens of Archaeopteryx and a feather that may belong to it have been found . All of the fossils come from the limestone deposits , quarried for centuries , near Solnhofen , Germany . 
 The initial discovery , a single feather , was unearthed in 1860 or 1861 and described in 1861 by Hermann von Meyer . It is currently located at the Humboldt Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin . This is generally assigned to Archaeopteryx and was the initial holotype , but whether it is a feather of this species , or another , as yet undiscovered , proto @-@ bird is unknown . There are some indications it is not from the same animal as most of the skeletons ( the " typical " A. lithographica ) . 
 The first skeleton , known as the London Specimen ( BMNH <unk> ) , was unearthed in 1861 near Langenaltheim , Germany , and perhaps given to local physician Karl Häberlein in return for medical services . He then sold it for £ 700 to the Natural History Museum in London , where it remains . Missing most of its head and neck , it was described in 1863 by Richard Owen as Archaeopteryx <unk> , allowing for the possibility it did not belong to the same species as the feather . In the subsequent fourth edition of his On the Origin of Species , Charles Darwin described how some authors had maintained " that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the <unk> period ; but now we know , on the authority of professor Owen , that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand ; and still more recently , that strange bird , the <unk> , with a long lizard @-@ like tail , bearing a pair of feathers on each joint , and with its wings furnished with two free claws , has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen . Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world . " 
 The Greek term " pteryx " ( <unk> ) primarily means " wing " , but can also designate merely " feather " . Meyer suggested this in his description . At first he referred to a single feather which appeared to resemble a modern bird 's remex ( wing feather ) , but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the London specimen , to which he referred as a " <unk> eines mit <unk> Federn <unk> <unk> " ( " skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers " ) . In German , this ambiguity is resolved by the term <unk> which does not necessarily mean a wing used for flying . <unk> was the favoured translation of Archaeopteryx among German scholars in the late nineteenth century . In English , " ancient pinion " offers a rough approximation . 
 Since then twelve specimens have been recovered : 
 The Berlin Specimen ( <unk> 1880 / 81 ) was discovered in 1874 or 1875 on the <unk> near Eichstätt , Germany , by farmer Jakob Niemeyer . He sold this precious fossil for the money to buy a cow in 1876 , to innkeeper Johann <unk> , who again sold it to Ernst Otto Häberlein , the son of K. Häberlein . Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881 , with potential buyers including O. C. Marsh of Yale University 's Peabody Museum , it eventually was bought for 20 @,@ 000 Goldmark by the Humboldt Museum für Naturkunde , where it now is displayed . The transaction was financed by Ernst Werner von Siemens , founder of the famous company that bears his name . Described in 1884 by Wilhelm Dames , it is the most complete specimen , and the first with a complete head . In 1897 it was named by Dames as a new species , A. siemensii ; though often considered a synonym of A. lithographica , several 21st century studies have concluded that it is a distinct species which includes the Berlin , Munich , and Thermopolis specimens . 
 Composed of a torso , the Maxberg Specimen ( S5 ) was discovered in 1956 near Langenaltheim ; it was brought to the attention of professor Florian Heller in 1958 and described by him in 1959 . The specimen is missing its head and tail , although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact . Although it was once exhibited at the Maxberg Museum in Solnhofen , it is currently missing . It belonged to Eduard <unk> , who loaned it to the museum until 1974 . After his death in 1991 , it was discovered that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold . 
 The Haarlem Specimen ( TM <unk> / 29 , also known as the <unk> Specimen ) was discovered in 1855 near <unk> , Germany , and described as a Pterodactylus crassipes in 1857 by Meyer . It was reclassified in 1970 by John Ostrom and is currently located at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem , Netherlands . It was the very first specimen , despite the classification error . It is also one of the least complete specimens , consisting mostly of limb bones , isolated cervical vertebrae , and ribs . 
 The Eichstätt Specimen ( JM <unk> ) was discovered in 1951 near <unk> , Germany , and described by Peter Wellnhofer in 1974 . Currently located at the Jura Museum in Eichstätt , Germany , it is the smallest known specimen and has the second best head . It is possibly a separate genus ( Jurapteryx recurva ) or species ( A. recurva ) . 
 The Solnhofen Specimen ( unnumbered specimen ) was discovered in the 1970s near Eichstätt , Germany , and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer . Currently located at the Bürgermeister @-@ Müller @-@ Museum in Solnhofen , it originally was classified as Compsognathus by an amateur collector , the same mayor Friedrich Müller after which the museum is named . It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species , Wellnhoferia grandis . It is missing only portions of the neck , tail , backbone , and head . 
 The Munich Specimen ( BSP 1999 I 50 , formerly known as the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ Verein Specimen ) was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer . It currently is located at the <unk> Museum München in Munich , to which it was sold in 1999 for 1 @.@ 9 million Deutschmark . What was initially believed to be a bony sternum turned out to be part of the coracoid , but a cartilaginous sternum may have been present . Only the front of its face is missing . It has been used as the basis for a distinct species , A. bavarica , but more recent studies suggest it belongs to A. siemensii . 
 An eighth , fragmentary specimen was discovered in 1990 , not in Solnhofen limestone , but in somewhat younger sediments at <unk> , Suevia . Therefore , it is known as the <unk> Specimen , and had been known since 1996 only from a cast , briefly shown at the <unk> in Bamberg . The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund <unk> in 2009 . It was on display for the first time with six other original fossils of Archaeopteryx at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009 . A first , quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of Archaeopteryx . It was found in a limestone bed that was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds . 
 Another fragmentary fossil was found in 2000 . It is in private possession and , since 2004 , on loan to the Bürgermeister @-@ Müller Museum in Solnhofen , so it is called the Bürgermeister @-@ Müller Specimen ; the institute itself officially refers to it as the " Exemplar of the families Ottman & <unk> , Solnhofen " . As the fragment represents the remains of a single wing of Archaeopteryx , the popular name of this fossil is " chicken wing " . 
 Long in a private collection in Switzerland , the Thermopolis Specimen ( <unk> CSG 100 ) was discovered in Bavaria and described in 2005 by Mayr , Pohl , and Peters . Donated to the Wyoming Dinosaur Center in Thermopolis , Wyoming , it has the best @-@ preserved head and feet ; most of the neck and the lower jaw have not been preserved . The " Thermopolis " specimen was described in the 2 December 2005 Science journal article as " A well @-@ preserved Archaeopteryx specimen with theropod features " ; it shows that Archaeopteryx lacked a reversed toe — a universal feature of birds — limiting its ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk @-@ climbing lifestyle . This has been interpreted as evidence of theropod ancestry . In 1988 , Gregory S. Paul claimed to have found evidence of a hyperextensible second toe , but this was not verified and accepted by other scientists until the Thermopolis specimen was described . " Until now , the feature was thought to belong only to the species ' close relatives , the deinonychosaurs . " The Thermopolis Specimen was assigned to Archaeopteryx siemensii in 2007 . The specimen is considered to represent the most complete and best @-@ preserved Archaeopteryx remains yet . 
 The discovery of an eleventh specimen was announced in 2011 , and it was described in 2014 . It is one of the more complete specimens , but is missing much of the skull and one forelimb . It is privately owned and has yet to be given a name . Palaeontologists of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich studied the specimen , which revealed previously unknown features of the plumage , such as feathers on both the upper and lower legs and metatarsus , and the only preserved tail tip . 
 A twelfth specimen had been discovered by amateur collectors in 2010 at the <unk> quarry , but the finding was only announced in February 2014 . It is as yet not scientifically described . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Today , fossils of the genus Archaeopteryx are usually assigned to one or two species , A. lithographica and A. siemensii , but their taxonomic history is complicated . Dozens of names have been published for the handful of specimens , most of which are simply spelling errors ( lapsus ) . As interpreted today , the name A. lithographica only referred to the single feather described by Meyer . In 1954 Gavin de Beer concluded that the London specimen was the holotype . In 1960 , Swinton accordingly proposed that the name Archaeopteryx lithographica be placed on the official genera list making the alternative names Griphosaurus and <unk> invalid . The ICZN , implicitly accepting de Beer 's standpoint , did indeed suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens , which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between Meyer and his opponent Johann Andreas Wagner ( whose Griphosaurus <unk> – " problematic riddle @-@ lizard " – was a vitriolic sneer at Meyer 's Archaeopteryx ) . In addition , in 1977 the first specific name of the Haarlem specimen , crassipes , described by Meyer as a pterosaur before its true nature was realized , also was suppressed . 
 It has been noted that the feather , the first specimen of Archaeopteryx described , does not correspond well with the flight @-@ related feathers of Archaeopteryx . It certainly is a flight feather of a contemporary species , but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another , smaller species of feathered theropod , of which only this feather is known so far . As the feather had been designated the type specimen , the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer be applied to the skeletons , thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion . In 2007 , two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen , or neotype . This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate , and the London specimen was designated the neotype on October 3 , 2011 . 
 Below is a cladogram published in 2013 by Godefroit et al . 
 = = = Species = = = 
 It has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species , A. lithographica . Differences do exist among the specimens , and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens , some may be related to actual species diversity . In particular , the Munich , Eichstätt , Solnhofen , and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London , Berlin , and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger , having different finger proportions , having more slender snouts lined with forward @-@ pointing teeth , and possible presence of a sternum . Due to these differences , most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another . The Berlin specimen has been designated as <unk> siemensii , the Eichstätt specimen as Jurapteryx recurva , the Munich specimen as Archaeopteryx bavarica , and the Solnhofen specimen as Wellnhoferia grandis . 
 In 2007 , a review of all well @-@ preserved specimens including the then @-@ newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of Archaeopteryx could be supported : A. lithographica ( consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens ) , and A. siemensii ( consisting of at least the Berlin , Munich , and Thermopolis specimens ) . The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in A. lithographica ( the claws of A. siemensii specimens being relatively simple and straight ) . A. lithographica also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus . A supposed additional species , Wellnhoferia grandis ( based on the Solnhofen specimen ) , seems to be indistinguishable from A. lithographica except in its larger size .

 = = Controversy = = 
 = = = Authenticity = = = 
 Beginning in 1985 , a group including astronomer Fred Hoyle and physicist Lee Spetner published a series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of Archaeopteryx were forged . Their claims were repudiated by Alan J. Charig and others at the Natural History Museum in London . Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of <unk> ; for example , they proposed that , based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers , feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of cement , without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference . They also misinterpreted the fossils , claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather , when visibly this is not the case . In addition , they claimed that the other specimens of Archaeopteryx known at the time did not have feathers , which is incorrect ; the Maxberg and Eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers . 
 They also expressed disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly , or that one half of a slab containing fossils would have good preservation , but not the counterslab . These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils , because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces , which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave the bulk of the fossil on one side and little on the other . 
 Finally , the motives they suggested for a forgery are not strong , and are contradictory ; one is that Richard Owen wanted to forge evidence in support of Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution , which is unlikely given Owen 's views toward Darwin and his theory . The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin , hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery ; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen , so such an action would certainly backfire . 
 Charig et al. pointed to the presence of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions , and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation , as evidence that the feathers were original . Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer , but neglected to account for the fact that the cracks were old and had been filled with calcite , and thus were not able to propagate . They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X @-@ ray spectroscopy , and did find something that was not rock ; it was not cement either , and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen . Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists , as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology , and they never discussed the other feather @-@ bearing specimens , which have increased in number since then . Charig et al. reported a discolouration : a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation . It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured ( if not colour banded ) to some degree , so the darkness was attributed to such impurities . They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic . 
 = = = Phylogenetic position = = = 
 Modern paleontology has often classified Archaeopteryx as the most primitive bird . It is not thought to be a true ancestor of modern birds , but rather , a close relative of that ancestor . Nonetheless , Archaeopteryx was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird . Several authors have done so . Lowe ( 1935 ) and Thulborn ( 1984 ) questioned whether Archaeopteryx truly was the first bird . They suggested that Archaeopteryx was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups . Kurzanov ( 1987 ) suggested that <unk> was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than Archaeopteryx . Barsbold ( 1983 ) and <unk> and Van den Berge ( 1997 ) noted that many maniraptoran lineages are extremely birdlike , and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors . 
 The discovery of the closely related Xiaotingia in 2011 led to new phylogenetic analyses that suggested that Archaeopteryx is a <unk> rather than an avialan , and therefore , not a " bird " under most common uses of that term . A more thorough analysis was published soon after to test this hypothesis , and failed to arrive at the same result ; it found Archaeopteryx in its traditional position at the base of Avialae , while Xiaotingia was recovered as a basal dromaeosaurid or troodontid . The authors of the follow @-@ up study noted that uncertainties still exist , and that it may not be possible to state confidently whether or not Archaeopteryx is a member of Avialae or not , barring new and better specimens of relevant species . 
 Phylogenetic studies conducted by Senter , et al . ( 2012 ) and Turner , Makovicky , and Norell ( 2012 ) confirmed that Archaeopteryx was more closely related to living birds than to dromaeosaurids and troodontids . On the other hand , Godefroit , et al . ( 2013 ) recovered Archaeopteryx as more closely related to dromaeosaurids and troodontids in the analysis included in their description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna . The authors used a modified version of the matrix from the study describing Xiaotingia , adding <unk> elegans and Eosinopteryx brevipenna to it , as well as adding four additional characters related to the development of the plumage . Unlike the analysis from the description of Xiaotingia , the analysis conducted by Godefroit , et al. did not find Archaeopteryx to be related particularly closely to Anchiornis and Xiaotingia , which were recovered as basal troodontids instead . 
 <unk> and Novas ( 2013 ) found Archaeopteryx and ( possibly synonymous ) Wellnhoferia to be the basalmost avialans ( Avialae being defined by the authors as including Archaeopteryx lithographica and Passer , their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants ) , with Microraptoria , Unenlagiinae , and the clade containing Anchiornis and Xiaotingia being successively closer <unk> to the Avialae . Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit , et al . , using a more inclusive matrix than the one from the analysis in the description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna , also found Archaeopteryx to be a member of Avialae ( defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing Passer domesticus , but not Dromaeosaurus albertensis or Troodon formosus ) . Archaeopteryx was found to form a grade at the base of Avialae with Xiaotingia , Anchiornis , and Aurornis . Compared to Archaeopteryx , Xiaotingia was found to be more closely related to extant birds , while both Anchiornis and Aurornis were found to be more distantly so . 
 = = In popular culture = = 
 Archaeopteryx was long considered the earliest known bird , so it has received widespread attention in popular media . Its easily recognizable appearance , and the public 's interest in dinosaurs , have made Archaeopteryx a feature of worldwide popular culture . A main belt asteroid discovered in 1991 , <unk> Archaeopteryx , was named in honour of the genus . An early and unusual example is Alfred Jarry 's 1897 play Ubu <unk> , ou l <unk> ( ' Ubu cuckolded , or the Archaeopteryx ' ) , which features an Archaeopteryx as an important character . Arc <unk> , a popular outdoor clothing and sporting goods brand , is named for Archaeopteryx .

 The Daily Mash was launched in April 2007 by journalists Paul Stokes and Neil Rafferty . Stokes is a former business editor of The Scotsman and has also written for Scotland on Sunday and The Daily Record . Rafferty is a former political correspondent for The Sunday Times , has also written for the Press Association and Business AM , and is a former spokesman for the smokers ’ lobby group <unk> . The site was originally inspired by The Onion , a US satirical publication , as Stokes and Rafferty saw a gap in the market for a similar publication in Britain . Both journalists worked mainly for Scottish newspapers . 
 Stokes and Rafferty earn salaries from the site , and lead a small team of freelance writers . The site earns revenue through advertising and merchandise , and is a successful profit @-@ making enterprise . It presents a niche opportunity to advertisers because of its apparent target audience of procrastinating office workers ( Citi employees complained to The Daily Mash and independent publications after the company banned them from accessing the site ) . 
 Highlights of the publication 's first year have been published in book form as Halfwit Nation : Frontline Reporting from the War on Stupid , both to acclaim and to complaints of unintelligent , overly crude humour .

 = Bad Dreams ( Fringe ) = 
 " Bad Dreams " is the 17th episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . It was written and directed by Academy Award @-@ winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman , his first writing credit for a television show . In the episode , Olivia dreams she is causing people to either kill others or themselves , which leads her to meet Nick Lane , a man from her past that leads Olivia to discover their shared history as test subjects in a series of childhood drug trials . 
 The episode first aired on April 21 , 2009 in the United States on Fox to more than 9 @.@ 89 million viewers . It received generally positive reviews , with many critics praising the beginning dream sequence , the climax atop the building , and the final scene with Walter and the old footage of Olivia . Critics also enjoyed the further revelations about Olivia 's background ; the subject would later have an entire episode devoted to it in the third season . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Olivia ( Anna Torv ) dreams that she pushes a woman in front of a subway train at Grand Central Terminal , but assumes it was just in her head . In the morning however , the news reports that the woman killed herself with the train . Walter ( John Noble ) puts forth various theories , such as astral projection , while Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) thinks it was still just a dream . Olivia is unconvinced , and goes with the Fringe team to investigate . An NYPD officer ( April Grace ) escorts them to the crime scene , and Peter sees a red balloon floating and begins to believe her , as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously . 
 Olivia worries it will happen again , and though she attempts to ward off sleep , she next dreams that she helps a woman murder her husband at a restaurant . They interview the wife , who tells them she became so convinced her husband was going to leave her that she became angry and stabbed him . The team posits that while no one is actually causing the incidents , they are happening as Olivia has seen them . At the restaurant , the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane ( David Call ) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream , and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene . Walter posits that because she never sees him in her dreams , it was Lane , not Olivia , causing the people 's deaths . Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude 's Mental Hospital , who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident , but left after the visit of a mysterious man . The doctor described him as <unk> , meaning those near him adopt his emotions . Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child , Lane was treated with the nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials , and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes . 
 Walter tells Olivia that she may have been in the same drug trials as Lane , and that the bond they share stems from Walter and William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) pairing up the children in the " buddy system " . To find Lane , Walter uses this bond , putting Olivia under the effect of drugs so she experiences Lane 's emotions . She sees Lane sleep with a stripper , who then is influenced to kill herself in a mirror of Lane 's depressed thoughts ; afterwards , Olivia discovers where Lane lives . While they explore his apartment , a suicidal Lane walks down a sidewalk , influencing others to mirror his emotions , so that they follow him to the top of a building . Because of her past in the trials , Walter believes Olivia won 't be influenced by these suicidal thoughts , and she goes to encounter Lane alone . While Olivia does not remember him , he remembers her and the nickname he gave her : " Olive . " Olivia wounds him , breaking his mind @-@ control over the others , and he is placed in a medically @-@ induced longterm coma to control his emotions . 
 The episode ends with Walter watching a video of Olivia as a child , apparently taken while she was being administered Cortexiphan . Walter 's voice is heard on the tape , as is William Bell 's . Both are trying to calm little Olivia while she sits , huddled amidst a debris @-@ strewn room of equipment . It becomes clear Olivia has caused this chaos in Walter and Bell 's lab , presumably with her Cortexiphan @-@ induced abilities . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was written and directed by Academy Award @-@ winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman . Goldsman was " attracted " to the series because he believed that at the time , Fringe 's " mythology was already really starting to hum " . " Bad Dreams " was his first writing credit for a television episode , and he wrote several hours of material before co @-@ executive producer Jeff Pinkner helped him condense it . Every episode since " Bad Dreams " , Goldsman has been credited as a consulting producer . It marked the first episode with previous Fringe director Brad Anderson now also credited as a producer . 
 The opening scene in the subway was initially going to be on top of a building so that the episode would begin and end the same , but co @-@ creator J.J. Abrams thought it would be better to start it underground and " move up throughout the episode " . The episode began the setup of Olivia 's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials , which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes . All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia 's troubled frame of mind , and consequently the episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a " sense of unease " . The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the " hardest set to shoot at on the planet " because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew 's ability to move cameras around . As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals , they used a church for the mental hospital scenes . When Olivia , Peter , and Walter are en route to the climax at the building , the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving back and forth on the 59th Street Bridge . 
 The climatic scene where Olivia encounters Nick and the group of people at the top of the building was shot at 902 Broadway in Manhattan . Though the actors appeared to be on the edge of a very tall building , there was in fact a hidden roof extending out that they would have fallen on instead . The visual and special effects departments worked in conjunction to simulate the woman jumping off the building . While the actress simply jumped onto a tarp several feet below her , the crew rigged the car with pneumatic rams , air cannons , and cables to implode under the " weight " of her body , and then CGI was used to make the woman appear to fall on the car .
