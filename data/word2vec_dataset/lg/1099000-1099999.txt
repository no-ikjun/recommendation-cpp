 After World War II , Patton expressed anti @-@ Semitism and treated Jews badly in the former concentration camps – called displaced persons camps after the war - which he ran for the United States . According to The New York Times , Patton wrote into his journal that people believe " the Displaced Person is a human being , which he is not , and this applies particularly to the Jews who are lower than animals . ... " 
 Patton asked for a command in the Pacific Theater of Operations , begging Marshall to bring him to that war in any way possible , and Marshall said he would be able to do so only if the Chinese secured a major port for his entry , an unlikely scenario . In mid @-@ May , Patton flew to Paris , then London for rest . On June 7 , he arrived in Bedford , Massachusetts , for extended leave with his family , and was greeted by thousands of spectators . Patton then drove to Hatch Memorial Shell and spoke to some 20 @,@ 000 , including a crowd of 400 wounded Third Army veterans . In this speech he aroused some controversy among the Gold Star Mothers when he stated that a man who dies in battle is " frequently a fool " , adding that the wounded are heroes . Patton spent time in Boston before visiting and speaking in Denver and visiting Los Angeles , where he spoke to a crowd of 100 @,@ 000 at the Memorial Coliseum . Patton made a final stop in Washington before returning to Europe in July to serve in the occupation forces . 
 Patton was appointed military governor of Bavaria , where he led the Third Army in denazification efforts . Patton was particularly upset when learning of the end of the war against Japan , writing in his diary , " Yet another war has come to an end , and with it my usefulness to the world . " Unhappy with his position and depressed by his belief that he would never fight in another war , Patton 's behavior and statements became increasingly erratic . Various explanations beyond his disappointments have been proposed for Patton 's behavior at this point . Carlo D 'Este wrote that " it seems virtually inevitable ... that Patton experienced some type of brain damage from too many head injuries " from a lifetime of numerous <unk> and horse @-@ related accidents , especially one suffered while playing polo in 1936 . 
 Patton 's niece Jean Gordon appeared again ; they spent some time together in London in 1944 , and again in Bavaria in 1945 . Gordon actually loved a young married captain who left her despondent when he went home to his wife in September 1945 . Patton repeatedly boasted of his sexual success with this young woman but his biographers are skeptical . <unk> says the relationship was casual . Showalter believes that Patton , under severe physical and psychological stress , made up claims of sexual conquest to prove his virility . D 'Este agrees , saying , " His behavior suggests that in both 1936 [ in Hawaii ] and 1944 – 45 , the presence of the young and attractive Jean was a means of assuaging the anxieties of a middle @-@ aged man troubled over his virility and a fear of aging . " 
 Patton attracted controversy as military governor when it was noted that several former Nazi Party members continued to hold political posts in the region . When responding to the press about the subject , Patton repeatedly compared Nazis to Democrats and Republicans in noting that most of the people with experience in infrastructure management had been compelled to join the party in the war , causing negative press stateside and angering Eisenhower . On September 28 , 1945 , after a heated exchange with Eisenhower over his statements , Patton was relieved of his military governorship . He was relieved of command of the Third Army on 7 October , and in a somber change of command ceremony , Patton concluded his farewell remarks , " All good things must come to an end . The best thing that has ever happened to me thus far is the honor and privilege of having commanded the Third Army . " 
 Patton 's final assignment was to command the Fifteenth United States Army , based in Bad Nauheim . The Fifteenth Army at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff tasked to compile a history of the war in Europe . Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history , but quickly lost interest in the duty . He began traveling , visiting Paris , Rennes , Chartres , Brussels , Metz , Reims , Luxembourg , and Verdun , as well as Stockholm , where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics . Patton decided he would leave his post at the Fifteenth Army and not return to Europe once he left on December 10 for Christmas leave . He intended to discuss with his wife whether he would continue in a stateside post or retire .

 On December 8 , 1945 , Patton 's chief of staff , Major General Hobart Gay , invited him on a pheasant hunting trip near Speyer to lift his spirits . At 11 : 45 on December 9 , Patton and Gay were riding in Patton 's 1938 Cadillac Model 75 staff car driven by Private First Class Horace L. Woodring when they stopped at a railroad intersection in Mannheim @-@ <unk> to allow a train to pass . Patton , observing derelict cars along the side of the road , spoke as the car crossed the railroad track , " How awful war is . Think of the waste . " Woodring glanced away from the road when a 2 ½ ton GMC truck driven by Technical Sergeant Robert L. Thompson , who was en route to a quartermaster depot , suddenly made a left turn in front of the car . Woodring slammed on the brakes and turned sharply to the left , colliding with the truck at a low speed . 
 Woodring , Thompson and Gay were only slightly injured in the crash , but Patton had not been able to brace in time and hit his head on the glass partition in the back seat of the car . He began bleeding from a gash to the head and complained to Gay and Woodring that he was paralyzed and was having trouble breathing . Taken to a hospital in Heidelberg , Patton was discovered to have a compression fracture and dislocation of the cervical third and fourth vertebrae , resulting in a broken neck and cervical spinal cord injury that rendered him paralyzed from the neck down . He spent most of the next 12 days in spinal traction to decrease spinal pressure . All non @-@ medical visitors , except for Patton 's wife , who had flown from the U.S. , were forbidden . Patton , who had been told he had no chance to ever again ride a horse or resume normal life , at one point commented , " This is a hell of a way to die . " He died in his sleep of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure at about 18 : 00 on December 21 , 1945 . Patton was buried at the Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial in the Hamm district of Luxembourg City , alongside wartime casualties of the Third Army , per his request to " be buried with [ his ] men . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Patton 's colorful personality , hard @-@ driving leadership style and success as a commander , combined with his frequent political missteps , produced a mixed and often contradictory image . Patton 's great oratory skill is seen as integral to his ability to inspire troops under his command . Historian Terry Brighton concluded that Patton was " arrogant , publicity @-@ seeking and personally flawed , but ... among the greatest generals of the war . " Still , Patton 's impact on armored warfare and leadership were substantial , with the U.S. Army adopting many of Patton 's aggressive strategies for its training programs following his death . Many military officers claim inspiration from his legacy . The first American tank designed after the war became the M46 Patton . 
 Several actors have portrayed Patton on screen , the most famous being George C. Scott in the 1970 film Patton . Scott 's iconic depiction of Patton , particularly of his famous speech to the Third Army , earned him an Academy Award , and was instrumental in bringing Patton into popular culture as a folk hero . He would reprise the role in 1986 in the made @-@ for @-@ television film The Last Days of Patton . Other actors who have portrayed Patton include Stephen McNally in the 1957 episode " The Patton Prayer " of the ABC religion anthology series , Crossroads , John Larch in the 1963 film Miracle of the White Stallions , Kirk Douglas in the 1966 film Is Paris Burning ? , George Kennedy in the 1978 film Brass Target , Darren McGavin in the 1979 miniseries Ike , Robert Prentiss in the 1988 film Pancho Barnes , Mitchell Ryan in the 1989 film Double Exposure : The Story of Margaret Bourke @-@ White , Lawrence Dobkin in a 1989 episode of the miniseries War and Remembrance , Edward Asner in the 1997 film The Long Way Home , Gerald McRaney in the 2004 miniseries Ike : Countdown to D @-@ Day , Dan Higgins in a 2006 episode of the miniseries Man , Moment , Machine , and Kelsey Grammer in the 2008 film An American Carol .

 Patton deliberately cultivated a flashy , distinctive image in the belief that this would inspire his troops . He carried an ivory @-@ gripped , engraved , silver @-@ plated Colt Single Action Army .45 revolver on his right hip , and frequently wore an ivory @-@ gripped Smith & Wesson Model 27 .357 Magnum on his left hip . He was usually seen wearing a highly polished helmet , riding pants , and high cavalry boots . Likewise , Patton cultivated a stern expression he called his " war face . " He was known to oversee training maneuvers from atop a tank painted red , white and blue . His jeep bore oversized rank placards on the front and back , as well as a klaxon horn which would loudly announce his approach from afar . He proposed a new uniform for the emerging Tank Corps , featuring polished buttons , a gold helmet , and thick , dark padded suits ; the proposal was derided in the media as " the Green Hornet , " and was rejected by the Army . 
 Historian Alan Axelrod wrote that " for Patton , leadership was never simply about making plans and giving orders , it was about transforming oneself into a symbol . " Patton intentionally expressed a conspicuous desire for glory , atypical of the officer corps of the day which emphasized blending in with troops on the battlefield . He was an admirer of Admiral Horatio Nelson for his actions in leading the Battle of Trafalgar in a full dress uniform . Patton had a preoccupation with bravery , wearing his rank insignia conspicuously in combat , and at one point during World War I rode atop a tank into a German @-@ controlled village seeking to inspire courage in his men . 
 Patton was a staunch fatalist , and believed in reincarnation . He believed that he may have been a military leader killed in action in Napoleon 's army in a previous life , or a Roman legionary . 
 Patton developed an ability to deliver charismatic speeches , in part because he had trouble with reading . He used profanity heavily in his speech , which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command but offended other generals , including Bradley . The most famous of his speeches were a series he delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord . When speaking , he was known for his bluntness and <unk> ; he once said , " The two most dangerous weapons the Germans have are our own armored halftrack and jeep . The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic , thinking they are in a tank . The jeep because we have so many God @-@ awful drivers . " During the Battle of the Bulge , he famously remarked that the Allies should " let the sons @-@ of @-@ bitches [ Germans ] go all the way to Paris , then we 'll cut them off and round them up . " He also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could " drive the British back into the sea for another Dunkirk . " 
 As media scrutiny on Patton increased , his bluntness stirred a number of controversies . These began in North Africa when some reporters worried that he was becoming too close to former Vichy officials with Axis sympathies . His public image was more seriously damaged after word of the slapping incidents broke . Another controversy occurred prior to Operation Overlord when Patton spoke at a British welcoming club at Knutsford England and said , in part , " since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans , and of course , the Russians , to rule the world , the better we know each other , the better job we will do . " The next day news accounts misquoted Patton by leaving off the Russians . On a visit home after the war he again made headlines when he attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling them " the real heroes " of the war , unintentionally offending the families of soldiers who had been killed in action . His final media blowup occurred in September , 1945 , when goaded by reporters about Denazification , he said " Denazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office , who had held office or were quasi Democrats or Republicans and that would take some time . " This caused Eisenhower to relieve Patton from command of the Third Army . 
 As a leader , Patton was known to be highly critical , correcting subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions , but also being quick to praise their accomplishments . While he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed , he fired only one general during World War II , Orlando Ward , and only after two warnings , whereas Bradley sacked numerous generals during the war . Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command , particularly the wounded Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command , and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers , including blankets and extra socks , galoshes , and other items normally in short supply at the front . 
 Patton views on race were complicated and often negative . This may have been cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States . Privately he wrote of black soldiers : " Individually they were good soldiers , but I expressed my belief at the time , and have never found the necessity of changing it , that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor . " However , he also stated that performance was more important than race or religious affiliation : " I don 't give a damn who the man is . He can be a nigger or a Jew , but if he has the stuff and does his duty , he can have anything I 've got . By God ! I love him . " Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said , " Men , you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army . I would never have asked for you if you weren 't good . I have nothing but the best in my army . I don 't care what color you are , so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut <unk> ! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you . Most of all , your race is looking forward to you . Don 't let them down and , damn you , don 't let me down ! " Likewise , Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command . Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies . 
 After reading the Koran and observing North Africans , he wrote to his wife , " Just finished reading the Koran – a good book and interesting . " Patton had a keen eye for native customs and methods and wrote knowingly of local architecture ; he once rated the progress of word @-@ of @-@ mouth rumor in Arab country at 40 – 60 miles ( 64 – 97 km ) a day . In spite of his regard for the Koran , he concluded , " To me it seems certain that the fatalistic teachings of Mohammad and the utter degradation of women is the outstanding cause for the arrested development of the Arab ... Here , I think , is a text for some eloquent sermon on the virtues of Christianity . " Patton was impressed with the Soviet Union but was disdainful of Russians as " drunks " with " no regard for human life . " Later in life he also began to express growing feelings of antisemitism and anticommunism , as a result of his frequent controversies in the press . 
 = = = As viewed by Allied and Axis leaders = = = 
 On February 1 , 1945 , Eisenhower wrote a memo ranking the military capabilities of his subordinate American generals in Europe . Bradley and Army Air Force General Carl Spaatz shared the number one position , while Walter Bedell Smith was ranked number two , and Patton number three . Eisenhower revealed his reasoning in a 1946 review of the book Patton and his Third Army : " George Patton was the most brilliant commander of an army in the open field that our or any other service produced . But his army was part of a whole organization and his operations part of a great campaign . " Eisenhower believed that other generals such as Bradley should be given the credit for planning the successful Allied campaigns across Europe in which Patton was merely " a brilliant executor " . 
 Notwithstanding Eisenhower 's estimation of Patton 's abilities as a strategic planner , his overall view of Patton 's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe can best be seen in Eisenhower 's refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943 , after which he privately remarked , " Patton is indispensable to the war effort – one of the guarantors of our victory . " As Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy told Eisenhower : " Lincoln 's remark after they got after Grant comes to mind when I think of Patton – ' I can 't spare this man , he fights ' . " After Patton 's death , Eisenhower would write his own tribute : " He was one of those men born to be a soldier , an ideal combat leader ... It is no exaggeration to say that Patton 's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy . " 
 Carlo D 'Este insisted that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally , but Bradley biographer Jim DeFelice noted that the evidence indicates otherwise . President Franklin D. Roosevelt appeared to greatly esteem Patton and his abilities , stating " he is our greatest fighting general , and sheer joy . " On the other hand , Roosevelt 's successor , Harry S. Truman , appears to have taken an instant dislike to Patton , at one point comparing both him and Douglas MacArthur to George Armstrong Custer . 
 For the most part , British commanders did not hold Patton in high regard . Field Marshal Alan Brooke noted in January 1943 that " I had heard of him , but I must confess that his swashbuckling personality exceeded my expectation . I did not form any high opinion of him , nor had I any reason to alter this view at any later date . A dashing , courageous , wild and unbalanced leader , good for operations requiring thrust and push but at a loss in any operation requiring skill and judgment . " One possible exception was Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery . Although the latter 's rivalry with Patton was well known , Montgomery appears to have admired Patton 's ability to command troops in the field , if not his strategic judgment . Other Allied commanders were more impressed , the Free French in particular . General Henri Giraud was incredulous when he heard of Patton 's dismissal by Eisenhower in late 1945 , and invited him to Paris to be decorated by President Charles de Gaulle at a state banquet . At the banquet , President de Gaulle gave a speech placing Patton 's achievements alongside those of Napoleon . Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was apparently an admirer , stating that the Red Army could neither have planned nor executed Patton 's rapid armored advance across France . 
 While Allied leaders expressed mixed feelings on Patton 's capabilities , the German High Command was noted to have more respect for him than for any other Allied commander after 1943 . Adolf Hitler reportedly called him " that crazy cowboy general . " Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton 's leadership following the war , and many of its highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard . 
 Erwin Rommel credited Patton with executing " the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare . " Generaloberst Alfred Jodl , chief of staff of the German Army , stated that Patton " was the American Guderian . He was very bold and preferred large movements . He took big risks and won big successes . " Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring noted that " Patton had developed tank warfare into an art , and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field . I feel compelled , therefore , to compare him with Generalfeldmarschall Rommel , who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare . Both of them had a kind of second sight in regard to this type of warfare . " Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the Battle of El Alamein , Fritz Bayerlein opined that " I do not think that General Patton would let us get away so easily . " In an interview conducted for Stars and Stripes just after his capture , Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt stated simply of Patton , " He is your best . "

 The scaly @-@ breasted munia or spotted munia ( Lonchura punctulata ) , known in the pet trade as nutmeg <unk> or spice finch , is a sparrow @-@ sized estrildid finch native to tropical Asia . A species of the genus Lonchura , it was formally described and named by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 . Its name is based on the distinct scale @-@ like feather markings on the breast and belly . The adult is brown above and has a dark conical bill . The species has 11 subspecies across their range and differ slightly in size and colour . 
 This munia eats mainly grass seeds apart from berries and small insects . They forage in flocks and communicate with soft calls and whistles .

 The scaly @-@ breasted munia is about 11 – 12 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) long and weighs 12 – 16 grams ( 0 @.@ 026 – 0 @.@ 035 lb ) . The adult has a stubby dark bill typical of grain eating birds , brown upperparts and a dark brown head . The underparts are white with dark scale markings . The sexes are similar , although males have darker markings on the underside and a darker throat than females . 
 Immature birds have pale brown upperparts , lack the dark head found in adults , and have uniform buff underparts that can be confused with juveniles of other munia species such as the tricoloured munia ( Lonchura <unk> ) across the Asian and island populations and the black @-@ throated munia ( Lonchura kelaarti ) in parts of India or Sri Lanka . Populations within their wide distribution range show variations in plumage color and size . 
 Along with other <unk> , these species are thought to have originated in Asia . The species been introduced to other parts of the world due to its popularity as a cage bird and populations have established in the wild .

 Scaly @-@ breasted munias form flocks of as many as 100 birds . Individuals communicate with calls that include a short whistle , variations of kitty @-@ kitty @-@ kitty , and a sharp chipping alarm note . They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about . The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement . The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone <unk> .

 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The breeding season is during the summer rainy season ( mainly June to August in India ) but can vary . Laboratory studies have found that long day illumination and high humidity trigger gonadal growth . The song of the male is very soft but complex and variable , audible only at close range . This song described as a jingle consists of a series of high notes followed by a croaky rattle and ending in a slurred whistle . When singing the male sits in what is called the slope posture — erect with the head feathers raised . 
 There are two types of slope posture , a pre @-@ copulatory one and an ordinary one . The pre @-@ copulatory behavior of scaly @-@ breasted munia includes a sequence of actions . The first involves either the male or female playing with nest @-@ material . As soon as a bird has arranged the nest material in its bill , it begins to fly around in a zig @-@ zag path . Once a bird lands close to its partner , the male bends towards the female and wipes its bill . The male then sings with movements of the body . The female invites mounting with tail quivering . 
 The nest is a large domed structure loosely woven from blades of grass , bamboo or other leaves with a side entrance and is placed in a tree or under the eaves of a house . A study in southern India found the preferred nesting trees to be <unk> asiatica , <unk> montana and Acacia <unk> , especially short and bushy ones in areas with low canopy cover . The nest opening is located to face downwind of the most frequent wind direction . In northern India , they preferred isolated Acacia nilotica in non @-@ urban areas but used Thuja orientalis and <unk> longifolia in urban gardens . 
 Scaly @-@ breasted munia clutch usually contain 4 to 6 eggs , but can contain up to 10 . Both sexes build the nest and incubate the eggs , which hatch in 10 to 16 days . Juveniles typically fledge in three weeks . Both sexes may reach sexual maturity as early as 7 months after birth in captivity . In the wild , however , since maturation may be impacted by variable daylight and humidity , both sexes can take between 12 and 18 months to reach sexual maturity depending on the time of year . Scaly @-@ breasted munias have a typical life expectancy of 6 to 8 years . 
 = = Food and foraging = = 
 The scaly @-@ breasted munia feeds mainly on seeds but also eats small berries such as those of Lantana . Although the bill is suited for crushing small grains , they do not show lateral movements of the lower mandible which help European <unk> in <unk> seeds . Like some other munias , they may also feed on algae , a rich protein source , prior to the breeding season . 
 The ease of maintaining these birds in captivity has made them popular for studying behavior and physiology . Feeding behavior can be predicted by the optimal foraging theory , where animals minimize time and energy spent to maximize food intake . This theory has been tested by studying the strategies used by scaly @-@ breasted munias to increase their feeding efficacy . 
 = = = Flock size tradeoffs = = = 
 Studies on foraging have examined the effect of group size in reducing time spent on predator vigilance , thereby increasing feeding efficiency . According to the " many @-@ eyes " hypothesis , a reduction in the individual time spent on vigilance against threats in larger groups allows for more time to be spent on searching for food and feeding . Vigilance is greatest among solitary individuals and reduces as the group size increases to about four . The birds collect seeds more quickly in larger groups , reflecting decrease in individual vigilance , a decrease in handling time , and an increase in both search speed and focus when foraging . 
 Individuals may also take advantage of group foraging by " joining " members that have found food . The options to seek food or to join others that have discovered food involves information sharing and has been studied through what are termed " producer @-@ scrounger models " . A cost associated with group foraging is increased resource competition , which in turn may reduce anti @-@ predatory vigilance due to the intensity of foraging . Some studies show that increased competition results in a decreased feeding rate . 
 = = = Foraging models = = = 
 When foraging , scaly @-@ breasted munia can search as individuals or search for others that have found food and join them . The economic consequences of the decision to join others has been modeled in two ways : the producer @-@ scrounger model and the information sharing model . These models are based on hypotheses that differ in the degree of compatibility that is assumed between the two food and joining opportunity search modes . 
 The information sharing model assumes that individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer @-@ scrounger model assumes that the search modes are mutually exclusive . Hopping with the head facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird 's joining and finding , respectively . When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds , the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly . When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable , the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer @-@ scrounger model . 
 Studies show that scaly @-@ breasted munias tend to adopt the scrounger tactic when food is more clumped and when the group size increases . When most foragers adopt scrounging , the time taken to discover new food patches is greater . 
 = = = Vigilance = = = 
 Most social foragers must search for food while also avoiding predators . It has been suggested that individuals that play scrounger could also , by virtue of their head position , be alert for predators and hence contribute to antipredatory vigilance . If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance , then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities , and hence more joining . When stationary , the head @-@ up tactic has been shown to be associated with antipredatory vigilance . However scanning while hopping does not aid in vigilance and it is thought that the scrounger tactic is incompatible with antipredatory vigilance in the scaly @-@ breasted munia . 
 = = = Specialized foraging = = = 
 Scaly @-@ breasted munias have variable competitive behaviors that allow them to exploit scarce resources . There are two foraging alternatives : producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers . Studies show that these choices lead to a stable equilibrium within a group . When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger , frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff . Studies indicate that if most of the population consists of producers , then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal . On the other hand , if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored . 
 Three hypotheses might account for consistent foraging specializations across individuals : food source variation , phenotypic differences , and frequency dependent @-@ choice . The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging . The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ in their ability to use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one . The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock . The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill , but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives . At equilibrium , individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization . Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis . 
 Aviary experiments conducted with captive flocks of scaly @-@ breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency ( see Evolutionarily stable strategy ) when individuals are free to choose either behavior . The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies have been shown to converge on stable frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay @-@ offs from the choice of different feeding strategies . 
 Furthermore , foraging birds may feed actively on the substrate or pick grains dropped on the ground and these strategies may be chosen according to the situation . Early departures occur more often when expected searching time decreases and when competition intensity increases . Competition intensity is expected to increase when more scroungers are present or when patches are smaller . 
 = = = Prey crypsis = = = 
 Since producers search for food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join , prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging . Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and increased number of detection errors . Moreover , the presence of a competitor negatively affected foraging efficiency under <unk> backgrounds . The foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed . Thus , the costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers . 
 = = = Resource defence = = = 
 Recent models of economic defence in a group @-@ foraging context predict that the frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases . Studies with scaly @-@ breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch location was signaled , and the effect of changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not . Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable . Changing patch density had no effect on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled . When food location was signaled , increasing patch density resulted in the predicted decrease in the number of aggressive encounters . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Scaly @-@ breasted munias are found in a range of <unk> but are usually close to water and grassland . In India , they are especially common in paddy fields where they are considered a minor pest on account of their feeding on grain . They are found mainly on the plains , but can be observed in the foothills of the Himalayas , in which they may be present at altitudes near 2 @,@ 500 m ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) , and in the Nilgiris , where they are found at altitudes up to 2 @,@ 100 m ( 6 @,@ 900 ft ) during the summer . In Pakistan , they are restricted to a narrow region from Swat in the west to Lahore , avoiding the desert zone , and then occurring again in India east of an area between Ludhiana and Mount Abu . The species has also been observed in Kashmir , though this is rare . 
 Outside their native range , escaped birds frequently establish themselves in areas with a suitable climate and can then colonize new areas nearby . Escaped cage @-@ birds established in the wild and such populations have been recorded in the West Indies ( Puerto Rico since 1971 ) , Hawaii ( since 1883 ) , Australia , Japan and southern United States mainly in Florida and California . In Oahu , Hawaii , they compete for habitats with the tricolored munia and tend to be rare where this competitor is present . 
 = = Status and conservation = = 
 Lonchura punctulata is an abundant species and classified as " Least Concern " by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . The species occupies an extremely large range , and its population , while still unquantified , is large and stable . The scaly @-@ breasted munia is not globally threatened and is common to very common throughout most of its range . However , some populations , such as those in the Lesser Sunda Islands are scarce . 
 In many areas it is regarded as an agricultural pest , feeding in large flocks on cultivated cereals such as rice . In Southeast Asia , the scaly @-@ breasted munia is trapped in large numbers for Buddhist ceremonies , but most birds are later released . 
 = Satan 's Harvest Home = 
 Satan 's Harvest Home is a pamphlet published anonymously in 1749 in London , Great Britain . It describes and denounces what it deems the moral laxity and perversion of contemporary society , especially with reference to effeminacy , sodomy , and prostitution . The pamphlet incorporates some older material ; this attempts to diagnose the cause of a perceived increase in the prevalence of sodomy among gentlemen , and specifies a continental European origin for male effeminacy and female same @-@ sex relations . The pamphlet also features a poem , " Petit Maître " , denouncing male habits of feminine dress . 
 Contemporary scholars have found in the pamphlet evidence of several Early Modern British trends : the equation of effeminacy with homosexuality ; the use of Sappho as a symbol for lesbianism at a time when public awareness of lesbian relationships was increasing ; and an equation of Roman Catholic Italy and France with moral degeneracy . 
 = = Outline = = 
 The pamphlet 's full title is Satan 's Harvest Home : or the Present State of <unk> , Adultery , Fornication , Procuring , Pimping , Sodomy , And the Game of Flatts , ( Illustrated by an <unk> and Entertaining Story ) And other Satanic Works , daily propagated in this good Protestant Kingdom . It was printed " for the editor " – i.e. at the expense of the person who compiled it – and it was available for sale at locations across London , from several sellers in York , and in Bath . 
 Some of the material in the pamphlet appears to be either a straight reprint or plagiarism of older material , including from a 1734 text , Pretty Doings in a Protestant Nation , by the pseudonymous Father Poussin . Part of the same section also seems to have appeared in William Walsh 's 1691 A Dialogue Concerning Women . Another reused source is a <unk> ( 1720 in some sources ) pamphlet , Plain Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy in England . 
 = = = " Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy " = = = 
 In a section apparently reprinted from earlier publications , the pamphlet discerns " Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy " in a number of aspects of British culture . It claims that , in past ages , British middle @-@ class gentlemen had led moral , industrious lives , serving King , country , and family . This era , the pamphlet claims , was now past and lost ; the constitution of the gentleman has deteriorated . Contemporary infants , it says , faced grim prospects , being pampered in nurseries by mothers who dominated their weak fathers . Such children , the pamphlet argued , could not help but to grow up effete and were " scarcely worth raising " . Some of the blame for this , the pamphlet claims , lay with the increasing popularity of raising children at home , and having them educated by women , rather than sending them to school or to be apprenticed . Lacking the boisterous companionship of other boys they could not acquire manly traits ; governed by women , they never learned to dominate women themselves , which , the pamphlet claimed , was requisite to please a wife . 
 = = = Male effeminacy and sodomy = = = 
 One chapter of the pamphlet describes the physiognomy of the " <unk> type " , claiming that gentle , soft , and delicate men are predisposed toward sodomy . The next criticizes the feminine dress and hairstyling of young men whom it describes as " those Gentlemen who call themselves pretty Fellows " . It characterizes their appearance , in which men styled their hair and dressed in a manner similar to their footmen , as history 's most preposterous . ( In contemporary Britain fears about the consequences of homosexual relationships often centred on their perceived tendency to ignore ( and thus weaken ) class boundaries : an effeminate gentleman who dressed like his footman , a servant , embodied this class transgression in a threatening way . ) The habit of wearing makeup , the pamphlet says , was " as much in Vogue among our Gentlemen , as with the Ladies in France . " Italian opera , too , is criticized for its attributed tendency to <unk> men . 
 The same chapter describes same @-@ sex kissing , particularly between men , as the most hateful product of effeminacy . It claims the phenomenon originated in Italy and France , in the latter of which it says even nuns acted lasciviously together , and decries it as an " <unk> , Unnatural Usage ... the first Inlet to the detestable Sin of Sodomy " . The fashion for male public kissing , the author claims , allowed " <unk> " to approach men openly in the streets . 
 Sodomy itself , the pamphlet says , was widespread and becoming more so , and the numerous prosecutions represented likely just a fraction of the total incidences : " We have but too much reason to fear , that there are Numbers yet <unk> 'd , and that this abominable Practice gets Ground ev 'ry Day . " 
 = = = Female homosexual activity = = = 
 Same @-@ sex activity between women was also targeted . The pamphlet appears to have plagiarized the " Father Poussin " text to blame Sappho for devising the " Game of Flats " , a " new sort of Sin " , which has been interpreted to refer to sexual contact between women ( i.e. tribadism , a form of " flat " contact , without the presence of protuberant male genitalia ) . This activity , the book claims , is popular both " in Turkey " and " at Twickenham " . 
 = = = Prostitution = = = 
 The pamphlet claims the streets of London were astonishingly full of prostitutes , male and female , to the extent that whole districts – such as Drury Lane , which purportedly housed 107 brothels in the early 18th century – were exclusively inhabited by prostitutes : 
 ... quite up to St. Thomas 's @-@ street ( some few honest shopkeepers excepted ) is a Corporation of Whores , <unk> , Highwaymen , Gamesters , Pick @-@ pockets , and House @-@ breakers , who like Bats and Owls skulk in obscure Holes and Geneva shops by Day @-@ Light , but wander in the Night in search of Opportunities wherein to exercise their <unk> . ( Page 25 ) 
 Though the pamphlet describes the pitiable and desperate conditions in which prostitutes lived , and the corruption of the police supposed to be patrol them , it also accuses prostitutes of ' Inhumanity ' and deems them devilish and monstrous . The vices of the prostitute are presented as those endemic among all women . 
 = = = " Petit Maître " = = = 
 The pamphlet concludes with a poem , " Petit Maître " , criticizing a man with an effeminate appearance . The style has been characterized as satirical . The final verse not only exhorts men to dress in a masculine style , but suggests that the effeminate are in any case less than manly : 
 If thou art a Man , forbear 
 Thus , this <unk> Garb to wear ; 
 Do not Reason thus displace , 
 Do not Man @-@ hood thus disgrace ; 
 But thy Sex by Dress impart , 
 And appear like what thou art : 
 Like what thou art , said I , pray pardon me ; 
 I mean , appear like what thou ought 'st to be . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Some modern analyses have characterized the pamphlet as a " best @-@ seller " in its own time . Its familiarity today may also derive from its inclusion in several 19th century bibliographies : it was listed in W. T. Lowndes 's pioneering <unk> 's Manual of English Literature , published 1834 , generally regarded as the first such systematic literary bibliography . The pamphlet was also the subject of an extensive entry in the 1877 Index Librorum Prohibitorum of the pseudonymous <unk> <unk> ( really Henry Spencer Ashbee ) , an encyclopedia of erotic literature . The Index reproduced substantial portions of the original text , introducing the work as a " rare volume , its object being strictly moral . " 
 Modern scholars have attended to the pamphlet as an example of contemporary attitudes toward homophobia , effeminacy , prostitution , and even international relations . David Robinson characterizes the pamphlet 's contents as " blatant , vituperative homophobia " , and the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality identifies it as an effort to incite anti @-@ homosexual sentiment . Christopher Hobson presents pamphlets of this type as the handmaid of eighteenth @-@ century English judicial crackdowns against homosexual offenders ; as a mechanism whereby homosexual behaviour was kept indefensible , and potential perpetrators kept terrified . 
 Ian McCormick diagnoses the pamphlet as representing a gradual change in European discourse on the character of the sodomite : previous publications had discussed sexual deviance ( conceived in contemporary terms ) as a general evil ; with Satan 's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy . He argues that ' before the seventeenth century , sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves , heretics , sorcerers , and the like . Increasingly , however , it came to be linked with pride , excess of diet , idleness , and contempt of the poor . ' The pamphlet 's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period . 
 Other scholars have identified the text 's tone as satirical and mildly obscene , locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter @-@ trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution . Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites , and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain 's martial past and saw lack of respect for it as a precondition for vice . Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice , characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product , not a cause , of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London . 
 Many scholars have considered the pamphlet as evidence for an association , in eighteenth @-@ century thought , between same @-@ sex vice and the influence of continental ( and specifically Roman Catholic ) European mores , particularly of those from France and Italy . George Haggerty sees the pamphlet as typical of a trend in eighteenth century British discourse that blamed Italy and France for exporting sodomy to Britain ; Valerie Traub notes its references to " foreign contagion ... the criminal <unk> endemic to France and Italy . " . 
 George Rousseau , similarly , cites the pamphlet as part of a body of 1740s " sodomy " literature so wide @-@ ranging as to suggest that the term 's meaning might have been mutable , broad , and vague . He argues specifically that , in the 1740s , the term had a strong connotation of an imported vice ; it was often used in the 1740s to connote suspicion against foreigners . The pamphlet 's text , on page 50 , includes the strident claim " Damn 'd Fashion ! Imported from Italy amid 'st a Train of other unnatural Vices . Have we not Sins enough of our own , but we must eke ' em out with those of Foreign Nations , to fill up the Cup of our Abominations , and make us yet more ripe for Divine Vengeance ? " The plausibility of the theory that " sodomy " , however understood , was particularly prevalent in Italy is difficult to assess , though Trevor Dean notes that , earlier , seventeenth @-@ century Italy had undergone increasingly vigorous efforts to monitor and regulate sexual activity . 
 Historians of lesbianism have cited the work as early evidence of public awareness that a lesbian culture existed within eighteenth century England , and locate its references to Sappho as early indicators that that term was coming into general usage to describe lesbians .

The bridge served as a street car , vehicle and passenger bridge throughout its service life . In 1997 , the bridge was closed after the Connecticut Department of Transportation found the substructure to be moving .

 In 1909 , the City of Bridgeport created a special commission to oversee the construction of a bridge at Congress Street . A local engineer , Raymond F. Stoddard was hired as design consultant and obtained the license to use the Scherzer design . A Scherzer rolling @-@ lift bridge with a double @-@ leaf bascule was chosen for construction . The design is a Deck @-@ type plate girder bridge ; using two plate girders to support the deck . The Scherzer bascule was a popular design because it avoided the expense of high @-@ stress pivot bearings ; though it requires stronger foundations to support the weight of the bridge 's operation . The engineering firm , J. R. Worcester and Company designed and constructed the concrete @-@ arch approach and Fort Pitt Bridge Works fabricated the movable bridge . The cost of construction was $ 300 @,@ 000 , which was offset through funding from the Connecticut Company . A contemporary account from the Hartford Courant gave stated the contract was for $ 305 @,@ 000 to Snare , <unk> and Company . The bridge was opened to the public July 16 , 1910 . 
 The Congress Street Bridge spanned the Pequonnock River and was designed to carry both street cars , vehicles and pedestrians across the river . It was closed and left in the " open position " in 1997 when the Connecticut Department of Transportation found that the substructure was moving . With its closure , traffic has been diverted to the East Washington Avenue Bridge . In 2002 , the estimated cost to repair the bridge was $ 30 million , which could be partly funded by Connecticut 's " Local Bridge Program " . A total of $ 5 @.@ 8 million would be provided by the State of Connecticut with an additional $ 8 @.@ 8 million loan .

 According to Congressman Jim Himes ' website , the demolition funding was appropriated in 2009 and consisted of more than $ 2 million through federal funding . The money was funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , the Comprehensive Appropriations Act of 2009 , and a Community Development Block Grant . According to the Connecticut Post , the State of Connecticut funded $ 1 @.@ 2 million for the demolition of the bridge , and the first phase of the project was expected to cost $ 500 @,@ 000 . The contract for the demolition of the bridge was given to S & R Corporation and the first task was to remove the eastern portion of the bridge . The entire process was expected to take six weeks to demolish the bridge . It was estimated that another $ 450 @,@ 000 would be needed to remove the bridge 's concrete counter @-@ weights and $ 8 million to remove the approaches . In 2010 , the Drawbridge Operation Regulation ; Pequonnock River , Bridgeport , CT struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal .

 The Congress Street Bridge was on Connecticut Historical Commission 's list of bridges . Local businesses and residents have claimed that are experiencing reductions in traffic as a result of the closure of the bridge and that it has increased emergency response times . In 2002 , Bridgeport 's official historian , Charles W. <unk> , stated that the City of Bridgeport promised P. T. Barnum to keep the bridge open and free , forever . The promise was made when the city purchased the previous bridge from Barnum and annexed East Bridgeport in 1864 . However , limited funds became a concern , with the money needing to be directed to more important projects . 
 As of 2013 , federal funding has secured $ 40 million for a new bridge , but estimations project $ 60 million would be needed to complete the project . In a 2008 letter to Congress , the rehabilitation of the bridge was projected to secure 440 jobs as a " shovel @-@ ready " project example .

 " Cafe Disco " is the twenty @-@ seventh episode of the fifth season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the 99th overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on May 7 , 2009 . Feeling the office is overworked after the recent reign of Charles Miner , Michael sets up a " cafe disco " in his old Michael Scott Paper Company office . Phyllis injures her back dancing at the cafe disco and bonds with Dwight as he tries to relieve her back . Meanwhile , Jim and Pam plan to elope . 
 The episode was written by Warren Lieberstein & Halsted Sullivan and directed by Randall Einhorn . Several songs are featured in the episode , including " Car Wash " by Rose Royce , " Cat People " by David Bowie , " Everybody Dance Now " by C + C Music Factory and " Y.M.C.A. " by Village People . The episode received generally positive reviews and , according to Nielsen ratings , was watched by 7 @.@ 71 million viewers during its original broadcast . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Michael ( Steve Carell ) still has his lease on the closet he used as the office space for the Michael Scott Paper Company . Concerned that the office is still tense from the recent management by Dunder Mifflin vice president Charles Miner , Michael decides to convert the closet into a dance hall called Cafe Disco for his employees to socialize , drink coffee and dance . None of the employees care to join him , much to the disappointment of Michael , who plays music through the ventilation system to try tempting them to come . 
 Phyllis ( Phyllis Smith ) ultimately gives in and joins Michael ; she stops in to invite her husband Bob Vance ( Robert R. Shafer ) but his secretary , who resembles Phyllis , tells her Bob is not available , making Phyllis jealous . In Cafe Disco , Phyllis throws out her back after dancing too hard . Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) brings her into the conference room and starts giving her a kind of massage he usually gives injured horses . The two spend a long amount of time together and she eventually confides in Dwight that she fears her husband is having an affair with his new secretary , but the two laugh together when Phyllis realizes how ridiculous the idea sounds . 
 When the rest of the office is told of Phyllis 's injury , they take this as confirmation that the Cafe Disco is a bad idea and reprimand Michael for what happened to Phyllis . Disappointed and angry , Michael instructs Erin ( Ellie Kemper ) to close up the Cafe Disco . Kelly ( Mindy Kaling ) comes down with her and the two start dancing after Erin turns on the stereo . This catches the eye of two male employees from Vance Refrigeration , and soon Cafe Disco is full of both Dunder Mifflin employees and non @-@ employees , much to Michael 's delight . Oscar ( Oscar Nunez ) is mildly baffled that Erin actually invited one of her friends to come , as opposed to being ashamed of the office . Kelly and Andy ( Ed Helms ) get into a competitive dance @-@ off with each other , and Kevin ( Brian Baumgartner ) makes out in the corner with his girlfriend Lynne ( Lisa K. Wyatt ) . 
 Meanwhile , Jim ( John Krasinski ) and Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) have decided to avoid the expense and stress of a wedding and elope to a simple courthouse ceremony in Youngstown , Ohio without letting their co @-@ workers know . Pam comes to work with a wedding dress and Jim picks up flowers in the office parking lot . As they are leaving , they decide to stop in at Cafe Disco , and end up having a lot of fun , making them decide they really want an actual wedding ceremony after all . Phyllis eventually recovers and dances with Bob in the Cafe Disco . Michael tries to encourage Angela ( Angela Kinsey ) to dance , but she refuses because she doesn 't like " the general spirit of music . " When Angela starts softly shaking her foot to the beat , however , Michael is extremely satisfied with the small victory . At the end of the episode , an extremely nervous Andy gets his ear pierced by Kelly with a pin in the bathroom .

 " Cafe Disco " was written by Warren Lieberstein and Halsted Sullivan and directed by Randall Einhorn . The Office writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg appear in cameos as Vance Refrigeration employees who attend the Cafe Disco dance after spotting Kelly and Erin dancing together . Ed Helms , who describes himself as a poor dancer , said he found the dancing scenes very challenging and that he was very sore by the end of the filming . 
 The official website for The Office included four cut scenes from " Cafe Disco " within a week of its original release . In the first 80 @-@ second clip , Kevin meets Lynne in the elevator , where he tells her she smells like bacon , and says " I love the smell of bacon in the morning . " Later , he invites Lynne to Cafe Disco . In the second , 47 @-@ second clip , Michael insists he will not let the fun stop in the office , and tells the story of his grandfather , who he said was the most fun person until he was changed by his job . In the third , 30 @-@ second clip , Dwight talks to Phyllis about his experience in his high school girl 's softball team , which he was able to join due to the " landmark " Pennsylvania Supreme Court case , " Shrute vs. Lackawanna County Board of Education " . In the final , 30 @-@ second @-@ clip , Dwight tells the documentary crew about his hatred for Ohio , the home of his cousin <unk> , who he says should be kicked in the " groin area " because he 's a " cheat and a ball hog .

 During their dance competition , Andy does a dance involving a chair from the music video of the Madonna song " Vogue " , and Kelly does a reenactment of the silhouette chair dance from the 1983 romance film Flashdance , which inspired elements of a dance done by actress Vanessa Ferlito in the 2007 Quentin Tarantino film Death Proof . Jim and Pam plan to drive to Youngstown , a city in Mahoning County , Ohio , to get married in a courthouse . Dwight does an impression of actor Jack Nicholson 's character Jack Torrance from the 1980 Stanley Kubrick film The Shining . Michael described the positive office atmosphere to that of Dave & Buster 's , a restaurant and entertainment business . To signify the care @-@ free atmosphere of Cafe Disco , Michael hung on the wall a lei , a Hawaiian flower necklace . When his Cafe Disco idea was initially rejected , Michael said he could understand how it felt to be the tobacco company Philip Morris . 
 " Cafe Disco " included several callbacks to previous The Office episodes . Michael blames Charles Miner , the new Dunder Mifflin vice president , for the poor atmosphere around the office ; Charles was the antagonist of a recent six @-@ episode story arc revolving around Michael 's defection from Dunder Mifflin to the Michael Scott Paper Company . The office space used for Cafe Disco is the old Michael Scott Paper Company office space previously featured in the episodes " Michael Scott Paper Company " , " Heavy Competition " and " Broke " . The episode features Lynne ( Lisa K. Wyatt ) as Kevin 's date at the dance ; Lynne was previously introduced in " Blood Drive " , the fifth season 's Valentine 's Day episode , where the two met at an office singles party . Television reviewers also compared the bonding between Dwight and Phyllis in " Cafe Disco " as a throwback to " Crime Aid " , an episode earlier in the season , in which Phyllis tries to console a saddened Dwight in the wake of Andy and Angela 's engagement . Ironically , in preparing to elope with Jim , Pam pins back her hair , partially reverting to her style from earlier seasons , while conversely , Pam lets down her hair in " The Secret " when Kelly asks how Pam will style her hair to wed Roy .

 In its original American broadcast on May 7 , 2009 , " Cafe Disco " was watched by 7 @.@ 71 million viewers , according to Nielsen ratings , an increase from the previous week . The episode received a 4 @.@ 5 rating / 14 share among viewers aged between 18 and 34 , and a 3 @.@ 8 rating / 11 share among viewers between 18 and 49 . The episode outperformed the 3 @.@ 5 rating / 9 share of CBS ' crime drama series CSI : Crime Scene Investigation in the 18 — 49 category . The Office creator Greg Daniels said he was particularly proud of this , especially in light of the series ' upcoming 100th episode , " Company Picnic " ; Daniels said of beating CSI , " Who would have thought that when we aired for the first time ? " 
 The episode received generally positive reviews . Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode , comparing it positively to previous episodes " Casino Night " and " Booze Cruise " : " not as heavy or emotional , certainly , but still a chance to see our <unk> in a charming and demonstrative not @-@ quite @-@ work environment . " Lyons also complimented a number of changes in the series the episode seemed to indicate , including shifting allegiances , goodwill where there used to be bad and a possible budding romance between Andy and Kelly . Alan Sepinwall , television journalist with The Star @-@ Ledger , said the episode , " started off seeming like a dumb and pointless idea before gradually revealing itself to be a fun , and even welcome , diversion . " Sepinwall said the episode was not as funny as other recent ones , but that he enjoyed seeing the characters interact this way together , and particularly liked seeing Dwight and Phyllis bond , " even as he treated her like a racehorse " . Josh McAuliffe of The Times @-@ Tribune in Scranton , Pennsylvania , described the episode as " a wacky and wonderful little gem , one of those rare ones where it was just wall @-@ to @-@ wall happy , giddy fun , with not a drop of pathos , except for maybe Michael whining about having to eat lunch by himself . " McAuliffe also said he was glad to see Erin 's " cheerful , appealingly goofy personality " continue to emerge . 
 <unk> Rabin of The A.V. Club said the episode made him feel " borderline euphoric " , and said of it , " With a light touch the show made an insightful point — that we need our dance @-@ offs and workday discos and spontaneous expressions of delight . " Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode had " an infectious sense of fun " and felt as if the show producers " just turned the camera on the cast 's wrap party and let it roll a while " . However , Fickett also said very little actually happened in the episode , which he said felt " mostly like filler " between the recently finished Michael Scott Paper Company arc and the following week 's season finale , " Company Picnic " . New York magazine writer Will Leitch also said the episode felt lighter than recent episodes , but he said , " that ’ s okay : They ’ ve earned a week off , and they sure seem to be having a lot of fun . " He particularly praised the competition between Andy and Kelly , and Michael 's dancing : " There are few funnier dancers than Steve Carell , particularly Steve Carell amped on coffee . " Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said the episode allowed the entire cast to shine and included great chemistry between Phyllis Smith and Rainn Wilson . He also said he was glad to see Ellie Kemper get more screen time , " and not just because she 's Office eye candy . She adds some freshness to the cast , as she 's the only person at Dunder Mifflin right now who doesn 't really know anything about all the drama and backstory , so she just takes Michael and everyone else for face value . " Kelly West of Cinema Blend described " Cafe Disco " as " one of the most random episodes of The Office . " 
 " Cafe Disco " was voted the seventh highest @-@ rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season , according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally ; the episode was rated 8 @.@ 49 out of 10 .

 " Wichita Linebacker " is the third episode of the third season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars , and the forty @-@ seventh episode overall . Written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and directed by Harry Winer , the episode premiered on The CW on October 17 , 2006 . 
 The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars ( Kristen Bell ) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective . In this episode , Veronica helps a football player , Kurt Fenstermacher ( Armie Hammer ) retrieve his stolen playbook . Meanwhile , Piz ( Chris Lowell ) gains a job at the college radio station , and Veronica meets Dean O 'Dell ( Ed Begley , Jr . ) for the first time after she gets in trouble for events related to the events that occurred in the previous episode , " My Big Fat Greek Rush Week " . 
 Phil Klemmer and John Enbom , the writers of the episode , found the episode difficult to write because they were not very familiar with American football . However , they decided to resolve the problem by making the episode as little about football as possible . " Wichita Linebacker " also features a guest appearance by Armie Hammer , as well as the first appearances by Begley , Jr. as Cyrus O 'Dell and Ryan Devlin as Mercer Hayes . The episode received mixed to negative reviews , with criticism primarily focusing on the case of the week .

Veronica is called into the Dean O 'Dell 's office , and he threatens her with expulsion if she does not give up some names in relation to the sorority marijuana scandal . Piz calls Veronica in to help a football player , Kurt Fenstermacher , retrieve his playbook , with Kurt 's girlfriend , Trish ( Lindsey McKeon ) paying for the investigation . Veronica 's only suggestion is that he gets a new one . Veronica convinces her father , Keith Mars ( Enrico Colantoni ) , to hire Weevil as his new assistant at Mars Investigations . In an attempt to print a playbook for Kurt , Veronica disguises herself as a cheerleader , but fails to print one . After being called back into the Dean 's office , Veronica is in the room during a debate between fraternity boys and feminists . Veronica goes back to the football player , and she hypothesizes that his girlfriend ’ s ex @-@ boyfriend stole it . Weevil helps Keith at detective work , succeeding beyond Keith 's expectations .

 The episode was written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and directed by Harry Winer , marking both Klemmer and Enbom 's eleventh writing credit , and Winer 's third directing credit for the series . Klemmer and Enbom initially thought that they would be unable to write the episode because they didn 't know very much about American football — so they tried to make the episode less about football . Enbom stated , " Rob just sort of handed [ the episode ] down . I think if you play strict attention , you 'll find it isn 't as <unk> as an episode about a football player could possibly be . And I think that 's why . " The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team , so several scenes were devoid of extras , including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks into the locker room . 
 The episode features the first appearance of Dean Cyrus O 'Dell ( Ed Begley , Jr . ) , a recurring character for the third season . Initially , Michael McKean was slated to take the role , but within twelve hours of accepting the part , McKean decided to pass on Veronica Mars altogether . Thomas called this " the most depressing casting news in the world . " One week later , Begley accepted the role . Both actors had recently appeared in A Mighty Wind . " Wichita Linebacker " also includes a guest appearance by Armie Hammer , who plays Kurt Fenstermacher , the football player whose playbook is stolen . Ryan Devlin makes his first appearance as Mercer Hayes , a Hearst College student who would be convicted in the serial rape case in the episode " Spit & Eggs " . Despite having this role on Veronica Mars , Devlin would go on to play Duncan Kane , a role originated by Teddy Dunn before he left the show in " Donut Run " , in the spinoff web series Play It Again , Dick .

" However , he praised the return of Weevil . Rowan Kaiser , writing for The A.V. Club , was also relatively critical , while focusing praise on Weevil 's storyline . He referred to " Wichita Linebacker " as " what I would expect were the show not so ambitious . Here , Veronica isn 't going to Hearst College , she 's going to Television College , where things that are college @-@ y happen . " Television Without Pity gave the episode a " C + " . " I don 't think it 's being overly harsh to say that this was not one of this show 's stronger or more exciting episodes . The writing was oddly flat , in the first place , and the attention to detail was subpar as well . " In addition , the reviewer criticized the show 's treatment of its relationships . " That 's one of the things that 's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship @-@ centered show .

 = Georgia Tech Research Institute = 
 The Georgia Tech Research Institute ( GTRI ) is the nonprofit applied research arm of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , Georgia , United States . GTRI employs around 1 @,@ 765 people , and is involved in approximately $ 305 million in research annually for more than 200 clients in industry and government . 
 Initially known as the Engineering Experiment Station , ( EES ) the organization was proposed in 1929 by W. Harry Vaughan as an analogue to the agricultural experiment stations ; the Georgia General Assembly passed a law that year creating the organization on paper , but did not allocate funds to start it . To boost the state 's struggling economy in the midst of the Great Depression , funds were found , and the station was finally established with US $ 5 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 530 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) in April 1934 . 
 GTRI 's research spans a variety of disciplines , including national defense , homeland security , public health , education , mobile and wireless technologies , and economic development . Major customers for GTRI research include United States Department of Defense agencies , the state of Georgia , non @-@ defense federal agencies , and private industry . Overall , contracts and grants from Department of Defense agencies account for approximately 84 % of GTRI 's total research funding . Since it was established , GTRI has expanded its engineering focus to include science , economics , policy , and other areas that leverage GTRI 's partnership with Georgia Tech . GTRI researchers are named on 76 active patents and 43 pending patents . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 After being founded in 1885 , Georgia Tech grew from a trade school into a university over the course of several decades . However , there was little state initiative to see the school expand significantly until 1919 . That year , in a move similar to the Hatch Act of 1887 's establishment of agricultural experiment stations , the federal debate over whether to create engineering experiment stations in a similar manner spurred the Georgia General Assembly to pass an act titled " Establishing State Engineering Experiment Station at the Georgia School of Technology . " This station was established with the goal of the " encouragement of industries and commerce " within the state . The federal effort ultimately failed and the state did not finance the organization . 
 In 1929 , some Georgia Tech faculty members belonging to Sigma Xi started a Research Club at Tech that met once a month . One of the monthly subjects , proposed by W. Harry Vaughan , was a collection of issues related to Georgia Tech , such as library development , and the development of a state engineering station . This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiment stations at universities around the country , and a report was compiled by Harold Bunger , Montgomery Knight , and Vaughan in December 1929 . Their report noted that several similar organizations had been opened across the country at other engineering schools and were successful in local economic development . 
 In 1933 , S. V. Sanford , president of the University of Georgia , proposed that a " technical research activity " be established at Georgia Tech in order to boost the state 's struggling economy in the midst of the Great Depression . The Georgia Board of Regents provided the new Engineering Experiment Station with $ 5 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 530 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , and Georgia Tech provided infrastructure and personnel . The station started operation in April 1934 . 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Vaughan was selected as the Engineering Experiment Station 's acting director in April 1934 , and hired 13 part @-@ time faculty and a few graduate assistants . The station 's initial areas of focus were textiles , ceramics , and helicopter engineering . The early work of the station was conducted in the basement of the Old Shop Building next to Tech Tower , and Vaughan 's office was in the Aeronautical Engineering Building . The station 's name was technically the State Engineering Experiment Station , but it was generally referred to as the Engineering Experiment Station ( EES ) or simply " the research station " . 
 By 1938 , the Engineering Experiment Station was producing useful technology , and the station needed a method to conduct contract work outside the state budget . Consequently , the Industrial Development Council ( IDC ) was formed . The IDC was created as a non @-@ profit contract organization for the EES , which allowed the EES to receive federal contracts while still retaining its relationship with Georgia Tech and the State of Georgia . It was created by the Chancellor of the University System and the president of Georgia Power Company , and the Engineering Experiment Station 's director was a member of the council . The IDC later became the Georgia Tech Research Corporation , which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments . In addition , the contract organization manages the intellectual property that results from research . 
 Examples of projects undertaken under Vaughan 's directorship include Montgomery Knight 's helicopter research , the Georgia Economic Survey , $ 6 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 500 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) in aeronautical research for the Guggenheim Foundation , and textile research that created cotton roving and spinning processes that were three to five times faster than contemporary practices . Vaughan was instrumental in securing a permanent building for the station , initially known as the Research Building ; several years later it was expanded and named the Thomas Hinman Research Building , after Atlanta dentist and university donor Thomas Hinman . After Vaughan left for the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1940 , Harold Bunger ( head of the Chemistry Department ) took over as acting director . However , Bunger died not long thereafter in August 1941 . Bunger 's successor was Gerald Rosselot , who had been appointed assistant director by Georgia Tech 's president in 1940 . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 The number and value of contracts coming to the station significantly increased during World War II ; the 1943 – 1944 budget was the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the station 's other income , most notably , its state appropriation . Director Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the Georgia General Assembly had cut the station 's appropriation by 40 % , but increased support from industry and government eventually compensated for lower state funding . World War II is credited with GTRI 's entry into electronics , especially telecommunications and electronic warfare ; the electronics and communications work that Director Rosselot attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research . Two of the larger projects were a study on the propagation of electromagnetic waves , and United States Navy – sponsored radar research . 
 At the end of World War II , Georgia Tech had about $ 240 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 8 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) annually in sponsored research . Important investments during Rosselot 's administration at the Engineering Experiment Station included the purchase of an electron microscope in 1946 for $ 13 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 500 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , the first such instrument in the Southeastern United States and one of few in the United States at the time . The Research Building was expanded , and a $ 300 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 9 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) Westinghouse A @-@ C network calculator was given to Georgia Tech by Georgia Power in 1947 . 
 Rosselot 's administration included the 1946 establishment of the Industrial Development Council , renamed to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1948 and to its present name , the Georgia Tech Research Corporation , in 1984 . The Georgia Board of Regents had ruled that all money received in a year had to be spent that year , which was problematic because most government contracts the EES had received spanned multiple years . Georgia Tech president Blake Van Leer and vice president Cherry Emerson solution was to create the Industrial Development Council , a non @-@ profit corporation that would manage contracts for research services and subsequently hire the Engineering Experiment Station to perform the research . It would handle patents garnered through research , and distribute funds garnered from contracts and patents as needed . The new organization was almost immediately used to weather a severe drop in state support ( from $ 89 @,@ 000 to $ 3 @,@ 000 ) during the recession of 1949 . 
 = = = Scientific Atlanta = = = 
 Glen P. Robinson and six other Georgia Tech researchers ( including Robinson 's former professor and future EES director Jim Boyd and EES director Gerald Rosselot ) each contributed $ 100 ( equivalent to $ 3 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) and founded Scientific Associates ( later known as Scientific Atlanta ) on October 31 , 1951 with the initial goal of marketing antenna structures being developed by the radar branch of the EES . Robinson worked as the general manager without pay for the first year ; after the fledgling company 's first contract resulted in a $ 4 @,@ 000 loss , Robinson ( upon request ) refunded five of the six other initial investors . 
 From 1950 to 1952 , there were a series of disputes between EES director Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station 's finances and Rosselot 's hand in founding Scientific Associates . When it was founded in October 1951 , Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates ; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech , and what , if any , role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace . Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech . However , Rosselot 's participation in Scientific Associates ' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech 's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center . 
 In September 1952 , the Board of Regents requested an audit of EES 's financial operation . Of primary concern was the reporting of overhead income , which the Board suspected was inadequate . The audit found discrepancies in the accounts receivable that were attributed to EES 's practice of delaying reporting information on <unk> by a month , a tactic that had become common to ensure working capital due the regents ' failure to adequately fund the station . Though Rosselot denied malfeasance , the practice nonetheless did not conform to the University System of Georgia 's established procedures for budget reporting . As a result , Rosselot went on leave from his post at Georgia Tech in November 1952 , pending the acceptance of his resignation by the chancellor , which became effective March 1 , 1953 . Following his resignation , Rosselot soon accepted a position with the Bendix Corporation 's aviation division . 
 = = = Cold War era = = = 
 In March 1950 , Herschel H. Cudd was appointed head of EES 's Chemical Sciences division . After Gerald Rosselot went on leave pending his resignation , Cudd was named acting director of EES in November 1952 , then named director in July 1953 , and resigned in November 1953 to accept a much higher @-@ paying position at the American <unk> Corporation . Although he was in the post for only a year , Cudd made far @-@ reaching changes to the station . Under Rosselot , research had been increasingly concentrated on a few researchers ; Cudd reversed this trend to the extent that EES 's 1952 – 53 Annual Report stated that 66 faculty in 15 schools performed research at the station that year . Cudd created a new promotion system for researchers that is still in use to this day . Many EES researchers held the rank of professor despite lacking a doctorate ( or a comparable qualification for promotion as determined by the Georgia Board of Regents ) , something that irritated members of the teaching faculty . The new system , approved in the spring of 1953 , used the Board of Regents ' qualifications for promotion and mirrored the academic tenure track . 
 Cudd spent a significant amount of the EES operating budget on improving laboratory facilities . Cudd 's successor Paul K. Calaway , previously director of the School of Chemistry , made a last @-@ minute request to the contract organization in May 1954 to cover the resulting $ 20 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 470 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) deficit . In 1954 , a faculty committee appointed to do a comprehensive study of Georgia Tech , " The Aims and Objectives of the Georgia Institute of Technology " , noted that of EES 's budget of $ 2 million for 1953 – 1954 ( equivalent to $ 46 million in 2015 ) , about 83 % was sponsored by governmental agencies , and about two thirds of that was classified . In 1955 , the Rich Electronic Computer Center , a new wing on the Hinman Research Building , was dedicated ; the project was paid for by $ 85 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 1 @,@ 840 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) from the Rich Foundation and a matching grant from the EES 's contract organization . 
 This period saw a significant expansion in Georgia Tech 's postgraduate education programs , which received substantial support from the EES . Despite its slow start , with the first Master of Science programs in the 1920s and the first Doctorate in 1946 , the program became firmly established . In 1952 alone , around 80 students earned graduate degrees while working at EES . 
 James E. Boyd was promoted to Assistant Director of Research at the station in 1954 , and succeeded Calaway as director on July 1 , 1957 . While at Georgia Tech , Boyd wrote an influential article about the role of research centers at institutes of technology , which argued that research should be integrated with education , and Boyd correspondingly involved undergraduates in his research . Boyd was known for recruiting faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research ; one such example is his recruitment of noted physicist and nuclear scientist Earl W. McDaniel . 
 Under Boyd 's purview , the Engineering Experiment Station gained many electronics @-@ related contracts , to the extent that an Electronics Division was created in 1959 ; it would focus on radar and communications . Boyd championed the establishment of research facilities . In 1955 , Georgia Tech president Blake Van Leer appointed Boyd to Georgia Tech 's Nuclear Science Committee . The committee recommended the creation of a Radioisotopes Laboratory Facility and a large research reactor on campus . The former was built and dedicated on January 7 , 1959 , and could receive , store , and process radioactive materials . The Frank H. Neely Research Reactor was completed in 1963 and was operational until 1996 , when it was <unk> due to safety concerns related to the nearby 1996 Summer Olympics events . The reactor was permanently decommissioned in 1999 . 
 Throughout the Cold War era , radar and antenna related applications remained a prominent research activity in EES ' contracts with the Defense Department . Millimeter wave radar research , in particular , was prominent in EES ' defense activities from the late 1950s , when the first military @-@ designation millimeter wave radar was built at Georgia Tech , to the 1980s , when GTRI developed what was then the world 's highest frequency microwave radar . EES ' high @-@ frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy , meteorology and climate studies , which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in NASA 's planning of the Cassini and Galileo missions . Expansion of EES ' antenna research in the 1970s , in particular , the development of an air defense antenna for the U.S. Army Missile Command , resulted in the establishment of the Huntsville Research Laboratory , GTRI 's oldest off @-@ campus research center . 
 In 1980 , EES developed a <unk> @-@ approved version of the Apple II Plus for U.S. Army <unk> , and used it as a component in the earliest versions of the <unk> system . <unk> in 1982 , the <unk> system was the first tactical system using video disk ( <unk> ) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as order of battle , airfields , roadways , and bridges . President Ronald Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative resulted in the largest research contract in Georgia Tech 's history in 1985 . The $ 21 @.@ 3 million contract ( equivalent to $ 46 @.@ 9 million in 2015 ) was divided between GTRI and the School of Electrical Engineering . GTRI landed its own largest @-@ ever contract in 1986 — $ 14 @.@ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 31 @.@ 7 million in 2015 ) to create a Soviet surface @-@ to @-@ air missile system simulator . In 1989 , as part of a project with the U.S. Army , and using technology it had been developing since the late 1960s , GTRI completed the largest outdoor compact antenna range at Fort Huachuca , Arizona . 
 On April 10 , 1989 , GTRI announced that one of its research groups , led by James Mahaffey , had duplicated the results of a controversial University of Utah experiment that had allegedly achieved cold fusion in a jar of water . Four days following the announcement , the researchers discovered that the instrument used to measure neutrons was damaged by the heat of the liquid and gave false , elevated readings . GTRI immediately retracted its support of the Utah researchers ' findings , citing the flawed measurement . Director Donald J. Grace referred to the mistake as " embarrassing " , recalling that he and Mahaffey " blushed the whole time " . 
 = = = Expansion and reorganization = = = 
 The Georgia General Assembly amended EES ' charter in the early 1960s , authorizing an " industrial extension service to meet the technical , informational and other needs of industry and local development groups " . This led to an expansion of some of EES ' activities that it had been involved in since the 1940s . In particular , EES began providing additional services as a technological incubator during this time frame , and began an international development initiative that improved infrastructure and facilitated technology transfer in over 40 developing nations . The station 's expanded mission bolstered its traditional research strengths , resulting in work on projects that improved radar operation on the Saturn rocket and in the invention of the compact antenna range by Richard C. Johnson . Throughout the 1960s , these changes brought about an increased focus on research that sought to solve societal problems rather than research for the sake of pure scientific knowledge . This came at a time when director Maurice W. Long began placing an emphasis on graduate education and multidisciplinary research . 
 The late 1960s saw a period of student unrest , and university research centers that worked on contracts for the Department of Defense were often the site of student protests . Neither Georgia Tech nor EES became the focus of protests , and Long attributed this to the school 's " conservative student body " . For other reasons , however , EES became embattled financially and politically as a result of cuts in federal and state spending as well as cuts to the space program . Georgia Tech 's academic units were similarly affected by these cuts , which helped rekindle the debate over EES ' relationship with the school . 
 Georgia Tech president Arthur G. Hansen 's " bold and controversial " solution to both entities ' problems was to completely absorb the station into Georgia Tech 's academic units . On paper , this would dramatically increase Georgia Tech 's stated research funding ( as all of it would be performed through the academic units ) , and it would increase options and financial aid for graduate students . Another , less publicized , reason was that Georgia Tech would gain access to the contract organization 's reserve fund , which was said to be over $ 1 million ( equivalent to $ 6 @.@ 1 million in 2015 ) . Thomas E. Stelson , Dean of the College of Engineering at Georgia Tech , was named to " reorganize " the station . Publicly , Stelson 's task was simply to recommend a plan for reorganization , but the administration clearly intended for Georgia Tech and the Engineering Experiment Station to be closely integrated . Maurice W. Long , who was director of the station at the time , viewed the move as a violation of the EES 's charter as legislatively established by the Georgia General Assembly in 1919 , and asserted that Georgia Tech did not have the authority to merge the two institutions . EES employees and business executives involved with the station appealed to the Georgia Board of Regents and to Governor of Georgia ( and future United States President ) Jimmy Carter ( himself a Georgia Tech alumnus ) ; the controversy received coverage in both The Technique and the Atlanta Constitution . 
 When former EES director James E. Boyd was appointed as interim president of Georgia Tech following the departure of Hansen , he stopped the plan for complete absorption of the station , but did allow plans for closer control and more aggressive contract solicitation to proceed . Among these measures were increased resource @-@ sharing , including increased sharing of physical assets and research staff . The latter was evidenced by the increase in joint faculty appointments between the EES and Georgia Tech . The move paid off , and the fiscal year 1970 – 1971 saw EES win new contracts and grants , totaling a record $ 5 @.@ 2 million ( equivalent to $ 30 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) . Stelson was left in charge of the station 's reorganization and was named interim director upon Long 's departure in 1975 . During his tenure , Stelson reorganized the station into eight semi @-@ autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele , a model it retains ( with slight modifications ) to this day . 
 The Engineering Experiment Station was renamed the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1984 . A separate organization , originally called the Industrial Development Council , changed its name to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in February 1946 , and finally to the Georgia Tech Research Corporation in 1984 . There are legal difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities , especially the federal government , so the second organization is a contracting organization . Most importantly , it allows the university to perform multi @-@ year contracts that are not possible under state law , which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year . The name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with the federal government . GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s : the Centennial Research Building opened on the north end of the Georgia Tech campus in 1985 , providing expanded lab and office space , and the electromagnetic radiation measurement range was established at GTRI 's Cobb County research facility .

 From 1992 to 1997 , retired Vice Admiral Richard H. Truly was GTRI 's director . Truly helped GTRI survive a recession and the end of the Cold War despite its dependence on United States Department of Defense ( DOD ) contracts . During his tenure the percentage of GTRI 's budget from the DOD did experience a small decrease ( from 76 percent to 70 percent ) , but this was balanced by increased research in other fields . In 1997 , GTRI passed $ 100 million in research contracts , with 546 awards for $ 103 @,@ 061 @,@ 780 ( equivalent to $ 182 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) . One of GTRI 's more widely used ( and ongoing ) products , <unk> , was initially developed in the early 1990s ; it is a geographic information system that allows pilots to plot flight paths while integrating real @-@ time military intelligence . 
 Truly was replaced by Edward K. Reedy , who served from 1998 to 2003 . Reedy encouraged funding researchers who had ideas that needed support , and introduced a new cost accounting standard for recovering indirect expenditures . Reedy was particularly influential in securing the $ 7 @.@ 3 million in funding required to build the Food Processing Technology Building . Under his leadership , GTRI 's first endowed chair was established in March 1998 in honor of Glen P. Robinson , the $ 1 @.@ 5 million Glen P. Robinson Chair in Electro @-@ Optics . GTRI and Georgia Tech played host to sitting president George W. Bush in March 2002 ; a mock disaster was staged during the visit , demonstrating new technologies . At the end of Reedy 's tenure , GTRI had $ 115 million in research contracts ( equivalent to $ 162 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , a new high . Much new funding came as an indirect result of the September 11 attacks and the resulting War on Terrorism as the DOD increased related research . 
 Stephen E. Cross was selected as director in late 2003 . In March 2010 , Cross was named Executive Vice President for Research , a newly created position within Georgia Tech with oversight over all research at the university , including GTRI , the Georgia Tech Research Corporation , the school 's interdisciplinary research centers , and the Enterprise Innovation Institute ; and will " work closely with " academic researchers . He began his new role on May 1 , 2010 , and was replaced as director by Robert McGrath . 
 Some recent notable projects have included the Deployable Joint Command and Control System and ULTRA AP , a concept combat vehicle . In 2010 , researchers developed <unk> planar ion traps using VLSI techniques for use in a trapped ion quantum computer . Also in 2010 , researchers developed a method of using GPGPU to crack passwords , coming up with a minimum secure password length of 12 characters . Researchers are investigating the use of radar as a possible concussion detection tool . 
 GTRI is the primary contractor of the Homeland Open Security Technology program , which aims to promote the creation and use of open security and open @-@ source software in the United States government and military , especially in areas pertaining to computer security . GTRI personnel are involved in DARPA 's Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales project through the Proactive Discovery of Insider Threats Using Graph Analysis and Learning system .

 As of June 2013 , GTRI employed 1 @,@ 765 people , 637 of which were support staff , and 314 of which were students . Out of the approximately 900 research scientists and engineers working for GTRI in June 2013 , 18 % had attained a doctorate , 56 % had a master 's degree , and 26 % had a bachelor 's degree . In 2011 , GTRI employees ' generational breakdown included approximately 5 % from the " Silent Generation " ( born in 1922 – 1945 ) ; 30 % from the " baby boomers " ( born in 1946 – 1964 ) ; 27 % from " Generation X " ( born in 1965 – 1980 ) ; and 38 % from " Generation Y " ( born since 1981 ) . 
 In 2014 , GTRI had $ 305 million in revenue , and $ 363 million in contract awards . In 2014 , the United States Department of Defense consisted of 84 % of GTRI 's awards by value ; the remainder was composed of federal ( 7 % ) ; non @-@ DOD ( 3 % ) state and local ( 3 % ) ; and university , business , or nonprofit ( 2 % ) . GTRI researchers are named on 76 active patents and 43 pending patents . 
 = = = Facilities = = = 
 In total , the organization has at least 892 @,@ 000 square feet ( 82 @,@ 900 m2 ) of laboratory and facility space . GTRI is headquartered on the Georgia Tech campus in Midtown Atlanta , Georgia , where five of its seven research laboratories are located . Some major buildings are the Centennial Research Building , the Baker Building , and the GTRI Headquarters . The GTRI Headquarters contains the GTRI Conference Center , which has 10 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 930 m2 ) of space and hosts over 300 events a year . 
 Other notable Atlanta buildings include the Food Processing Technology Building and the GTRI Machine Services Building . Two GTRI laboratories operate at an off @-@ campus research facility , the Cobb County Research Facility , approximately fifteen miles north of Atlanta in Cobb County adjacent to the Dobbins Air Reserve Base . Additionally , GTRI operates the Applied Systems Laboratory in Huntsville , Alabama . 
 GTRI opened an international office in Athlone , Ireland in June 2006 . This effort was expanded when Georgia Tech , the National University of Ireland , Galway and the University of Limerick partnered in June 2010 to create a joint translational research institute . GTRI has several field offices that help with nearby on @-@ site research and needs . These are in Dallas , Texas , Dayton , Ohio , Shalimar , Florida ( near Eglin Air Force Base ) , Huntsville , Alabama , Jacksonville , Florida , Orlando , Florida , Panama City , Florida , Quantico , Virginia , San Diego , California , Tucson , Arizona , Warner Robins , Georgia ( near Robins Air Force Base ) , and Arlington , Virginia / Washington , DC .

 = = = Structure = = = 
 GTRI is composed of eight laboratories organized by technical focus into three research and development directorates . Each lab is further subdivided into divisions . Labs frequently collaborate with one another and outside groups ( both academic units and external companies ) based on the requirements of each project . GTRI performs research for clients at the local , regional , national , and international level , and employees are encouraged to publish their work and present it at conferences and consortia . 
 GTRI is an operating unit of Georgia Tech although it performs research under commercial cost principles for non @-@ profit organizations . For that reason , it uses a separate contracting entity , the Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation ( GTARC ) . Although GTARC is the contracting entity , the Georgia Tech Research Corporation ( <unk> ) owns the intellectual property created by all Georgia Tech researchers and manages technology protection and licensing . GTRI reports to the Georgia Tech Executive Vice President of Research ( as of 2013 , Stephen E. Cross ) who currently serves as the President of GTARC . 
 GTRI 's project directors are responsible for direction of all aspects of projects , including marketing , contract development , research , and fulfillment . Most projects are conducted on a cost @-@ <unk> basis and are negotiated by Georgia Tech 's Office of Sponsored Programs with terms and conditions appropriate for contracts specific to the operation of a university research organization . 
 The organization is led by the Director , who is also considered a vice president of Georgia Tech . Five people report to the director : the Deputy Director and Associate Vice Provost for Research ; the Deputy Director for Support Operations ; and the three deputy directors in charge of each research and development directorate . The eight lab directors report to their respective deputy director of research and development . The business strategist , financial operations director , and chief scientist all report to the Deputy Director / Vice Provost . Business services , human resources , information systems , machine services , and other support services report to the Deputy Director for Support Operations . 
 GTRI , like many traditional boards of directors , has an External Advisory Council , which consists of individuals who are notable in related fields of industry , government or academia and who provide advice about research direction , strategy , and markets , although they do not govern the organization . Members of the Board of Trustees of the contracting agency , GTARC , are not necessarily members of the External Advisory Council , although there is sometimes overlap between them . 
 = = = University affiliation = = = 
 GTRI contributes to the Georgia Tech research environment for faculty and students by conducting externally sponsored , applications @-@ oriented research programs that benefit the state , region , and nation . These programs , led by GTRI research faculty , contribute to national security , civilian needs , and industrial competitiveness , and provide students with career experience through graduate research assistantships , cooperative education programs , and undergraduate assistantships . Since 1995 , GTRI ( and in particular , its Huntsville Laboratory ) has been a University Affiliated Research Center , a designation by the United States Department of Defense intended to maintain what it calls " essential engineering and technology capabilities " . 
 GTRI is the largest single employer of Georgia Tech graduate and undergraduate students ; as of 2013 , GTRI employed 186 graduate co @-@ ops and research assistants and 128 undergraduate co @-@ ops . GTRI 's contributions to the Georgia Tech community include collaborative research with academic faculty , courses originated by GTRI faculty , and joint service efforts . Collaboration is strong between the faculties of GTRI and the academic schools and departments . Many GTRI researchers hold appointments as adjunct faculty members in Georgia Tech academic departments , serve on thesis advisory committees , and teach both academic and continuing education courses . 
 GTRI reaches out to Georgia Tech 's academic and research departments for collaboration on many research activities , building interdisciplinary teams that take advantage of the broad expertise within Georgia Tech 's highly ranked programs . One such collaboration is with the Georgia Tech Information Security Center to create GTRI 's newest laboratory , the Cyber Technology and Information Security Laboratory ( <unk> ) .

 Like many research universities , Georgia Tech has many smaller organizational units dedicated to interdisciplinary research , which combines two or more academic fields into one single discipline . The following centers are based out of the Georgia Tech Research Institute : 
 = HDMI = 
 HDMI ( High @-@ Definition Multimedia Interface ) is a proprietary audio / video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI @-@ compliant source device , such as a display controller , to a compatible computer monitor , video projector , digital television , or digital audio device . HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards . 
 HDMI implements the EIA / CEA @-@ 861 standards , which define video formats and waveforms , transport of compressed , uncompressed , and LPCM audio , auxiliary data , and implementations of the <unk> EDID . CEA @-@ 861 signals carried by HDMI are electrically compatible with the CEA @-@ 861 signals used by the digital visual interface ( DVI ) . No signal conversion is necessary , nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI @-@ to @-@ HDMI adapter is used . The CEC ( Consumer Electronics Control ) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one remote control handset . 
 Several versions of HDMI have been developed and deployed since initial release of the technology but all use the same cable and connector . Other than improved audio and video capacity , performance , resolution and color spaces , newer versions have optional advanced features such as 3D , Ethernet data connection , and CEC ( Consumer Electronics Control ) extensions . 
 Production of consumer HDMI products started in late 2003 . In Europe either DVI @-@ HDCP or HDMI is included in the HD ready in @-@ store labeling specification for TV sets for HDTV , formulated by <unk> with SES Astra in 2005 . HDMI began to appear on consumer HDTV camcorders and digital still cameras in 2006 . As of January 8 , 2013 ( ten years after the release of the first HDMI specification ) , over 3 billion HDMI devices have been sold . 
 = = History = = 
 The HDMI founders are Hitachi , Panasonic , Philips , Silicon Image , Sony , Thomson , RCA and Toshiba . Digital Content Protection , LLC provides HDCP ( which was developed by Intel ) for HDMI . HDMI has the support of motion picture producers Fox , Universal , Warner Bros. and Disney , along with system operators DirecTV , EchoStar ( Dish Network ) and <unk> . 
 The HDMI founders began development on HDMI 1 @.@ 0 on April 16 , 2002 , with the goal of creating an AV connector that was backward @-@ compatible with DVI . At the time , DVI @-@ HDCP ( DVI with HDCP ) and DVI @-@ HDTV ( DVI @-@ HDCP using the CEA @-@ 861 @-@ B video standard ) were being used on HDTVs . HDMI 1 @.@ 0 was designed to improve on DVI @-@ HDTV by using a smaller connector and adding audio capability and enhanced YCbCr capability and consumer electronics control functions . 
 The first Authorized Testing Center ( ATC ) , which tests HDMI products , was opened by Silicon Image on June 23 , 2003 , in California , United States . The first ATC in Japan was opened by Panasonic on May 1 , 2004 , in Osaka . The first ATC in Europe was opened by Philips on May 25 , 2005 , in Caen , France . The first ATC in China was opened by Silicon Image on November 21 , 2005 , in Shenzhen . The first ATC in India was opened by Philips on June 12 , 2008 , in Bangalore . The HDMI website contains a list of all the <unk> . 
 According to In @-@ Stat , the number of HDMI devices sold was 5 million in 2004 , 17 @.@ 4 million in 2005 , 63 million in 2006 , and 143 million in 2007 . HDMI has become the de facto standard for HDTVs , and according to In @-@ Stat , around 90 % of digital televisions in 2007 included HDMI . In @-@ Stat has estimated that 229 million HDMI devices were sold in 2008 . On April 8 , 2008 there were over 850 consumer electronics and PC companies that had adopted the HDMI specification ( HDMI adopters ) . On January 7 , 2009 , HDMI Licensing , LLC announced that HDMI had reached an installed base of over 600 million HDMI devices . In @-@ Stat has estimated that 394 million HDMI devices will sell in 2009 and that all digital televisions by the end of 2009 would have at least one HDMI input . 
 On January 28 , 2008 , In @-@ Stat reported that shipments of HDMI were expected to exceed those of DVI in 2008 , driven primarily by the consumer electronics market . 
 In 2008 , PC Magazine awarded a Technical Excellence Award in the Home Theater category for an " innovation that has changed the world " to the CEC portion of the HDMI specification . Ten companies were given a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for their development of HDMI by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences on January 7 , 2009 . 
 On October 25 , 2011 , the HDMI Forum was established by the HDMI founders to create an open organization so that interested companies can participate in the development of the HDMI specification . All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights , may participate in the Technical Working Group , and if elected can be on the Board of Directors . There is no limit to the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though companies must pay an annual fee of $ 15 @,@ 000 with an additional annual fee of $ 5 @,@ 000 for those companies who serve on the Board of Directors . The Board of Directors will be made up of 11 companies who are elected every 2 years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members . All future development of the HDMI specification will take place in the HDMI Forum and will be built upon the HDMI <unk> specification . Also on the same day HDMI Licensing , LLC announced that there were over 1 @,@ 100 HDMI adopters and that over 2 billion HDMI @-@ enabled products had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard . From October 25 , 2011 , all development of the HDMI specification became the responsibility of the newly created HDMI Forum . 
 On January 8 , 2013 , HDMI Licensing , LLC announced that there were over 1 @,@ 300 HDMI adopters and that over 3 billion HDMI devices had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard . The day also marked the 10 @-@ year anniversary of the release of the first HDMI specification .

 The HDMI specification defines the protocols , signals , electrical interfaces and mechanical requirements of the standard . The maximum pixel clock rate for HDMI 1 @.@ 0 was 165 MHz , which was sufficient to allow 1080p and <unk> ( 1920 × 1200 ) at 60 Hz . HDMI 1 @.@ 3 increased that to 340 MHz , which allows for higher resolution ( such as <unk> , 2560 × 1600 ) across a single digital link . An HDMI connection can either be single @-@ link ( type A / C / D ) or dual @-@ link ( type B ) and can have a video pixel rate of 25 MHz to 340 MHz ( for a single @-@ link connection ) or 25 MHz to 680 MHz ( for a dual @-@ link connection ) . Video formats with rates below 25 MHz ( e.g. , 13 @.@ 5 MHz for 480i / NTSC ) are transmitted using a pixel @-@ repetition scheme . 
 = = = Audio / video = = = 
 HDMI uses the Consumer Electronics Association / Electronic Industries Alliance 861 standards . HDMI 1 @.@ 0 to HDMI 1.2a uses the EIA / CEA @-@ 861 @-@ B video standard , HDMI 1 @.@ 3 uses the CEA @-@ 861 @-@ D video standard , and HDMI 1 @.@ 4 uses the CEA @-@ 861 @-@ E video standard . The CEA @-@ 861 @-@ E document defines " video formats and waveforms ; colorimetry and quantization ; transport of compressed and uncompressed , as well as Linear Pulse Code Modulation ( LPCM ) , audio ; carriage of auxiliary data ; and implementations of the Video Electronics Standards Association ( <unk> ) Enhanced Extended Display Identification Data Standard ( E @-@ EDID ) " . On July 15 , 2013 , the CEA announced the publication of CEA @-@ 861 @-@ F which is a standard that can be used by interfaces such as DVI , HDMI , and <unk> . CEA @-@ 861 @-@ F adds the ability to transmit several Ultra HD video formats and additional color spaces . 
 To ensure baseline compatibility between different HDMI sources and displays ( as well as backward compatibility with the electrically compatible DVI standard ) all HDMI devices must implement the sRGB color space at 8 bits per component . Ability to use the YCbCr color space and higher color depths ( " deep color " ) is optional . HDMI permits sRGB 4 : 4 : 4 chroma subsampling ( 8 – 16 bits per component ) , xvYCC 4 : 4 : 4 chroma subsampling ( 8 – 16 bits per component ) , YCbCr 4 : 4 : 4 chroma subsampling ( 8 – 16 bits per component ) , or YCbCr 4 : 2 : 2 chroma subsampling ( 8 – 12 bits per component ) . The color spaces that can be used by HDMI are ITU @-@ R <unk> , ITU @-@ R <unk> @-@ 5 and IEC <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ 4 . 
 For digital audio , if an HDMI device has audio , it is required to implement the baseline format : stereo ( uncompressed ) PCM . Other formats are optional , with HDMI allowing up to 8 channels of uncompressed audio at sample sizes of 16 @-@ bit , 20 @-@ bit and 24 @-@ bit , with sample rates of 32 kHz , 44 @.@ 1 kHz , 48 kHz , 88 @.@ 2 kHz , 96 kHz , 176 @.@ 4 kHz and 192 kHz . HDMI also carries any IEC <unk> @-@ compliant compressed audio stream , such as Dolby Digital and DTS , and up to 8 channels of one @-@ bit DSD audio ( used on Super Audio CDs ) at rates up to four times that of Super Audio CD . With version 1 @.@ 3 , HDMI allows lossless compressed audio streams Dolby TrueHD and DTS @-@ HD Master Audio . As with the YCbCr video , audio capability is optional . Audio return channel ( ARC ) is a feature introduced in the HDMI 1 @.@ 4 standard . " Return " refers to the case where the audio comes from the TV and can be sent " upstream " to the AV receiver using the HDMI cable connected to the AV receiver . An example given on the HDMI website is that a TV that directly receives a terrestrial / satellite broadcast , or has a video source built in , sends the audio " upstream " to the AV receiver . 
 The HDMI standard was not designed to pass closed caption data ( for example , subtitles ) to the television for decoding . As such , any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream ( s ) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the <unk> . This limits the caption style ( even for digital captions ) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission . This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for <unk> . For example , a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p / 1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it , as there is no line 21 <unk> in that format . 
 = = = <unk> video = = = 
 The HDMI specification specifies several modes of uncompressed digital video . Although often HD video capable cameras include an HDMI interface for playback or even live preview , the image processor and the video processor of cameras usable for uncompressed video must be able to deliver the full image resolution at the specified frame rate in realtime without any missing frames causing jitter . Therefore , usable uncompressed video out of HDMI is often called " Clean HDMI " . 
 = = = Communication channel protocols = = = 
 HDMI has three physically separate communication channels , which are the DDC , TMDS and the optional CEC . HDMI 1 @.@ 4 added ARC and HEC . 
 = = = = DDC = = = = 
 The Display Data Channel ( DDC ) is a communication channel based on the I ² C bus specification . HDMI specifically requires the device implement the Enhanced Display Data Channel ( E @-@ DDC ) , which is used by the HDMI source device to read the E @-@ EDID data from the HDMI sink device to learn what audio / video formats it can take . HDMI requires that the E @-@ DDC implement I ² C standard mode speed ( 100 kbit / s ) and allows it to optionally implement fast mode speed ( 400 kbit / s ) . 
 The DDC channel is actively used for High @-@ bandwidth Digital Content Protection . 
 = = = = TMDS = = = = 
 Transition <unk> Differential Signaling ( TMDS ) on HDMI <unk> video , audio and auxiliary data using three different packet types , called the Video Data Period , the Data Island Period and the Control Period . During the Video Data Period , the pixels of an active video line are transmitted . During the Data Island period ( which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals ) , audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets . The Control Period occurs between Video and Data Island periods . 
 Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10 @-@ bit characters that are encoded using 8b / 10b encoding that differs from the original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b / 10b encoding for the Control Period . HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b / 10b encoding for the Data Island Period . Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32 @-@ bit Packet Header , which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes the contents of the packet . Each Packet contains four <unk> , and each <unk> is 64 bits in size , including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data , allowing for each Packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data . Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 Packets . Seven of the 15 Packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data , while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data . Among these are the General Control Packet and the <unk> Metadata Packet . The General Control Packet carries information on <unk> ( which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise ) and Color Depth ( which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color ) . The <unk> Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC . 
 = = = = CEC = = = = 
 Consumer Electronics Control ( CEC ) is an HDMI feature designed to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC @-@ enabled devices , that are connected through HDMI , by using only one of their remote controls ( for example by controlling a television set , set @-@ top box , and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV ) . CEC also allows for individual CEC @-@ enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention . 
 It is a one @-@ wire bidirectional serial bus that is based on the <unk> standard <unk> protocol to perform remote control functions . CEC wiring is mandatory , although implementation of CEC in a product is optional . It was defined in HDMI Specification 1 @.@ 0 and updated in HDMI 1 @.@ 2 , HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a ( which added timer and audio commands to the bus ) . USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC @-@ enabled devices . 
 = = = = ARC = = = = 
 HDMI 1 @.@ 4 introduces a feature called ARC ( Audio Return Channel ) among other features . Like HEC , the ARC feature uses two pins from the connector : a previously unused pin and the hot plug detect pin . 
 ARC is an audio link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A / V receiver or speaker system . This direction is used when the TV is the one that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment . A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix , but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment . Without ARC , the audio output from the TV needs to be routed by another cable , typically TOS @-@ Link or coax , into the speaker system . 
 = = = = HEC = = = = 
 HDMI 1 @.@ 4 introduces a feature called HEC ( HDMI Ethernet Channel ) among other features . Like ARC , the HEC feature uses two pins from the connector : a previously unused pin and the hot plug detect pin . 
 HDMI Ethernet Channel technology consolidates video , audio , and data streams into a single HDMI cable , and the HEC feature enables IP @-@ based applications over HDMI and provides a bidirectional Ethernet communication at 100 Mbit / s . The physical layer of the Ethernet implementation uses attenuated <unk> @-@ TX type signals on a single twisted pair for both transmit and receive . 
 HEC ( HDMI Ethernet Channel ) and ARC ( Audio Return Channel ) support combined by one port or cable is also sometimes referred to as " <unk> " ( HDMI Ethernet Audio Control ) . 
 = = = Compatibility with DVI = = = 
 HDMI is backward compatible with single @-@ link Digital Visual Interface digital video ( DVI @-@ D or DVI @-@ I , but not DVI @-@ A ) . No signal conversion is required when an adapter or asymmetric cable is used , so there is no loss of video quality . 
 From a user 's perspective , an HDMI display can be driven by a single @-@ link DVI @-@ D source , since HDMI and DVI @-@ D define an overlapping minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability . In the reverse case a DVI @-@ D monitor would have the same level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with High @-@ bandwidth Digital Content Protection ( HDCP ) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI , instead of RGB . An HDMI source such as a Blu @-@ ray player may demand HDCP @-@ compliance of the display , and refuse to output HDCP @-@ protected content to a non @-@ compliant display . A further complication is that there is a small amount of display equipment , such as some high @-@ end home theater projectors , designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP @-@ compliant . 
 Any DVI @-@ to @-@ HDMI adapter can function as an HDMI @-@ to @-@ DVI adapter ( and vice versa ) . Typically , the only limitation is the gender of the adapter 's connectors and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with . 
 Features specific to HDMI , such as remote @-@ control and audio transport , are not available in devices that use legacy DVI @-@ D signalling . However , many devices output HDMI over a DVI connector ( e.g. ATI 3000 @-@ series and NVIDIA GTX 200 @-@ series video cards ) , and some multimedia displays may accept HDMI ( including audio ) over a DVI input . Exact capabilities beyond basic compatibility vary from product to product . <unk> are generally bi @-@ directional . 
 = = = = Audio = = = = 
 Since the DVI specification does not include audio transport , an interoperability problem arises when an HDMI @-@ source drives a legacy DVI display ( such as a PC monitor ) , or conversely , when a DVI source drives an HDMI display . While HDMI and DVI compliance rules ensure that a DVI video connection can be successfully negotiated and established ( via a mutually capable display mode ) , the audio signal must still be transported through means outside of the DVI connection . Typically , an HDMI @-@ equipped source will provide additional outputs for audio , such as line @-@ level analog and S / PDIF , which provide a baseline audio program ( such as stereo PCM ) . Likewise , when displaying video from an HDMI jack , an HDMI @-@ equipped display may allow alternative audio sourcing from a separate pair of analog @-@ audio inputs . Provision for any of these compatibility mechanisms is down to the manufacturer ; they are not specified by HDMI . By 2010 , nearly all HDMI @-@ equipped sources ( set @-@ top and media @-@ extender boxes , Blu @-@ ray and DVD players , and PCs ) provided separate analog audio outputs , and many HDMI @-@ equipped televisions were equipped for alternate @-@ audio input when sourcing video from an HDMI input . 
 Some single @-@ directional active converters exist that can decrypt HDCP and split off audio signal as S / PDIF and / or line @-@ level analog signal , allowing converting DVI @-@ only displays with a HDMI @-@ compatible resolution into a full HDMI display . Because these converters use pass a " clean " and unencrypted HDMI signal , the availability of these converters is usually limited to the professional media production industry . 
 = = = Content protection ( HDCP ) = = = 
 High @-@ bandwidth Digital Content Protection ( HDCP ) is a newer form of digital rights management . Intel created the original technology to make sure that digital content followed the guidelines set by the Digital Content Protection group . 
 HDMI can use HDCP to encrypt the signal if required by the source device . CSS , <unk> and AACS require the use of HDCP on HDMI when playing back encrypted DVD Video , DVD Audio , HD DVD and Blu @-@ ray Disc . The HDCP Repeater bit controls the authentication and switching / distribution of an HDMI signal . According to HDCP Specification 1 @.@ 2 ( beginning with HDMI CTS 1.3a ) , any system that implements HDCP must do so in a fully compliant manner . HDCP testing that was previously only a requirement for optional tests such as the " <unk> HD " testing program is now part of the requirements for HDMI compliance . HDCP allows for up to 127 devices to be connected , with up to 7 levels , using a combination of sources , sinks and repeaters . A simple example of this is several HDMI devices connected to an HDMI AV receiver that is connected to an HDMI display . 
 Devices called HDCP strippers can remove the HDCP information from the video signal so the video can play on non @-@ HDCP @-@ compliant displays , though a fair use and non @-@ disclosure form must usually be signed with a registering agency before use .

 The plug ( male ) connector outside dimensions are 13 @.@ 9 mm × 4 @.@ 45 mm , and the receptacle ( female ) connector inside dimensions are 14 mm × 4 @.@ 55 mm . There are 19 pins , with bandwidth to carry all <unk> , <unk> and HDTV modes . It is electrically compatible with single @-@ link DVI @-@ D. 
 Type B 
 This connector is 21 @.@ 2 mm × 4 @.@ 45 mm and has 29 pins , carrying six differential pairs instead of three , for use with very high @-@ resolution future displays such as <unk> ( 3 @,@ 840 × 2 @,@ 400 ) . It is electrically compatible with dual @-@ link DVI @-@ D , but has not yet been used in any products . However , the use of the extra three differential pairs is reserved as of 1 @.@ 3 specification . This sector of market is probably replaced by DisplayPort . 
 Type C 
 This Mini connector is smaller than the type A plug , measuring 10 @.@ 42 mm × 2 @.@ 42 mm but has the same 19 @-@ pin configuration . It is intended for portable devices . The differences are that all positive signals of the differential pairs are swapped with their corresponding shield , the DDC / CEC Ground is assigned to pin 13 instead of pin 17 , the CEC is assigned to pin 14 instead of pin 13 , and the reserved pin is 17 instead of pin 14 . The type C Mini connector can be connected to a type A connector using a type A @-@ to @-@ type C cable . 
 Type D 
 This Micro connector shrinks the connector size to something resembling a micro @-@ USB connector , measuring only 6 @.@ 4 mm × 2 @.@ 8 mm For comparison , a micro @-@ USB connector is 6 @.@ 85 mm × 1 @.@ 8 mm and a USB Type @-@ A connector is 11 @.@ 5 mm × 4 @.@ 5 mm . It keeps the standard 19 pins of types A and C , but the pin assignment is different from both . 
 Type E 
 The Automotive Connection System has a locking tab to keep the cable from vibrating loose and a shell to help prevent moisture and dirt from interfering with the signals . A relay connector is available for connecting standard consumer cables to the automotive type . 
 = = = Cables = = = 
 Although no maximum length for an HDMI cable is specified , signal attenuation ( dependent on the cable 's construction quality and conducting materials ) limits usable lengths in practice . HDMI 1 @.@ 3 defines two cable categories : Category 1 @-@ certified cables , which have been tested at 74 @.@ 5 MHz ( which would include resolutions such as 720p60 and <unk> ) , and Category 2 @-@ certified cables , which have been tested at 340 MHz ( which would include resolutions such as <unk> and <unk> ) . Category 1 HDMI cables are marketed as " Standard " and Category 2 HDMI cables as " High Speed " . This labeling guideline for HDMI cables went into effect on October 17 , 2008 . Category 1 and 2 cables can either meet the required parameter specifications for <unk> skew , far @-@ end crosstalk , attenuation and differential impedance , or they can meet the required <unk> / equalized eye diagram requirements . A cable of about 5 meters ( 16 feet ) can be manufactured to Category 1 specifications easily and inexpensively by using 28 AWG ( 0 @.@ 081 mm ² ) conductors . With better quality construction and materials , including 24 AWG ( 0 @.@ 205 mm ² ) conductors , an HDMI cable can reach lengths of up to 15 meters ( 49 feet ) . Many HDMI cables under 5 meters of length that were made before the HDMI 1 @.@ 3 specification can work as Category 2 cables , but only Category 2 @-@ tested cables are guaranteed to work for Category 2 purposes . 
 As of the HDMI 1 @.@ 4 specification , the following cable types are defined for HDMI in general : 
 Standard HDMI Cable – up to 1080i and 720p 
 Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet 
 Automotive HDMI Cable 
 High Speed HDMI Cable – 1080p , 4K , 3D and deep color 
 High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet 
 An HDMI cable is usually composed of four shielded twisted pairs , with impedance of the order of 100 Ω , plus several separate conductors . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 An HDMI extender is a single device ( or pair of devices ) powered with an external power source or with the <unk> DC from the HDMI source . Long cables can cause instability of HDCP and blinking on the screen , due to the weakened DDC signal that HDCP requires . HDCP DDC signals must be multiplexed with TMDS video signals to be compliant with HDCP requirements for HDMI extenders based on a single Category 5 / Category 6 cable . Several companies offer amplifiers , equalizers and repeaters that can string several standard HDMI cables together . Active HDMI cables use electronics within the cable to boost the signal and allow for HDMI cables of up to 30 meters ( 98 feet ) ; those based on <unk> can extend to 100 meters ; HDMI extenders that are based on dual Category 5 / Category 6 cable can extend HDMI to 250 meters ( 820 feet ) ; while HDMI extenders based on optical fiber can extend HDMI to 300 meters ( 980 feet ) . 
 = = = Cost = = = 
 HDMI manufacturers pay an annual fee of US $ 10 @,@ 000 plus a royalty rate of $ 0 @.@ 15 per unit , reduced to $ 0 @.@ 05 if the HDMI logo is used , and further reduced to $ 0 @.@ 04 if HDCP is also implemented . An alternative fee for HDMI manufacturers making fewer than 10 @,@ 000 units per year is an annual fee of $ 5 @,@ 000 with a royalty rate of $ 1 per unit . The royalty only applies to final products and does not apply to products that are included in , or with , a licensed HDMI product that is already subject to the royalty . For example , an HDMI cable sold directly to consumers is paid for by the cable manufacturer ; however , if the cable manufacturer sells the HDMI cable to a HDTV manufacturer ( who then includes the cable with an HDTV subject to the royalty ) then the HDTV manufacturer pays only the royalty on the HDTV . 
 = = Versions = = 
 HDMI devices are manufactured to adhere to various versions of the specification , in which each version is given a number and / or letter , such as 1 @.@ 0 , 1 @.@ 2 , or <unk> Each subsequent version of the specification uses the same kind of cable but increases the bandwidth and / or capabilities of what can be transmitted over the cable . A product listed as having an HDMI version does not necessarily mean that it will have all of the features that are listed for that version , since some HDMI features are optional , such as deep color and xvYCC ( which is branded by Sony as " <unk> " ) . Note that with the release of the version 1 @.@ 4 cable , the HDMI Licensing LLC group ( which oversees the HDMI standard ) will require that any reference to version numbers be removed from all packaging and advertising for the cable . Non @-@ cable HDMI products starting on January 1 , 2012 will no longer be allowed to reference the HDMI number and will be required to state which features of the HDMI specification the product implements . 
 = = = Version 1 @.@ 0 = = = 
 HDMI 1 @.@ 0 was released December 9 , 2002 and is a single @-@ cable digital audio / video connector interface with a maximum TMDS bandwidth of 4 @.@ 95 Gbit / s . It defines up to 3 @.@ 96 Gbit / s of video bandwidth ( 1080p / 60 Hz or <unk> ) and 8 channel LPCM / 192 kHz / 24 @-@ bit audio .

 HDMI 1 @.@ 1 was released on May 20 , 2004 and added DVD @-@ Audio . 
 = = = Version 1 @.@ 2 = = = 
 HDMI 1 @.@ 2 was released August 8 , 2005 and added the option of One Bit Audio , used on Super Audio CDs , at up to 8 channels . It also added the availability of HDMI type A connectors for PC sources , the ability for PC sources to implement only the sRGB color space while retaining the option to implement the YCbCr color space , and required HDMI 1 @.@ 2 and later displays to allow low @-@ voltage sources . 
 HDMI 1.2a was released on December 14 , 2005 and fully specifies Consumer Electronic Control ( CEC ) features , command sets and CEC compliance tests . 
 = = = Version 1 @.@ 3 = = = 
 HDMI 1 @.@ 3 was released June 22 , 2006 and increased the single @-@ link bandwidth to 340 MHz ( 10 @.@ 2 Gbit / s ) . It optionally allows deep color , with 30 @-@ bit , 36 @-@ bit and 48 @-@ bit xvYCC , sRGB , or YCbCr , compared to 24 @-@ bit sRGB or YCbCr in previous HDMI versions . It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS @-@ HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers . It incorporates automatic audio syncing ( audio video sync ) capability . It defined cable Categories 1 and 2 , with Category 1 cable being tested up to 74 @.@ 25 MHz and Category 2 being tested up to 340 MHz . It also added the new type C Mini connector for portable devices . 
 HDMI 1.3a was released on November 10 , 2006 and had Cable and Sink modifications for type C , source termination recommendations , and removed <unk> and maximum rise / fall time limits . It also changed CEC capacitance limits , clarified sRGB video quantization range , and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in an altered form , with audio control commands added . It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD like from HDMI 1 @.@ 2 onwards . 
 HDMI <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were released on March 26 , 2007 , November 9 , 2007 , and August 25 , 2008 respectively . They do not introduce differences on HDMI features , functions , or performance , but only describe testing for products based on the HDMI 1.3a specification regarding HDMI compliance ( <unk> ) , the HDMI type C Mini connector ( <unk> ) and active HDMI cables ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Version 1 @.@ 4 = = = 
 HDMI 1 @.@ 4 was released on May 28 , 2009 , and the first HDMI 1 @.@ 4 products were available in the second half of 2009 . HDMI 1 @.@ 4 increases the maximum resolution to 4K × 2K , i.e. 4096 × 2160 at 24 Hz ( which is a resolution used with digital theaters ) or <unk> × 2160 ( Ultra HD ) at 24 Hz / 25 Hz / 30 Hz ; adds an HDMI Ethernet Channel ( HEC ) , which allows for a 100 Mbit / s Ethernet connection between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection ; and introduces an audio return channel ( ARC ) , 3D Over HDMI , a new Micro HDMI Connector , expanded set of color spaces , with the addition of <unk> , Adobe RGB and Adobe <unk> ; and an Automotive Connection System . HDMI 1 @.@ 4 defines several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative ( interlaced ) , frame packing ( a full resolution top @-@ bottom format ) , line alternative full , side @-@ by @-@ side half , side @-@ by @-@ side full , 2D + depth , and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth ( <unk> ) , with additional top / bottom formats added in version <unk> HDMI 1 @.@ 4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24 . High Speed HDMI 1 @.@ 3 cables work with all HDMI 1 @.@ 4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel . 
 HDMI 1.4a was released on March 4 , 2010 and adds two additional mandatory 3D formats for broadcast content , which was deferred with HDMI 1 @.@ 4 in order to see the direction of the 3D broadcast market . HDMI 1.4a has defined mandatory 3D formats for broadcast , game , and movie content . HDMI 1.4a requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24 , side @-@ by @-@ side horizontal at either <unk> or <unk> , and top @-@ and @-@ bottom at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24 . 
 HDMI <unk> was released on October 11 , 2011 . One of the new features is that it adds the ability to carry 3D 1080p video at 120 Hz – allowing frame packing 3D format at <unk> per Eye ( 120 Hz total ) . All future versions of the HDMI specification will be made by the HDMI Forum that was created on October 25 , 2011 . 
 = = = Version 2 @.@ 0 = = = 
 HDMI 2 @.@ 0 , referred to by some manufacturers as HDMI UHD , was released on September 4 , 2013 . 
 HDMI 2 @.@ 0 increases the maximum TMDS per channel throughput from 3 @.@ 4 Gbit / s to 6 Gbit / s which allows for a maximum total TMDS throughput of 18 Gbit / s . This enables HDMI 2 @.@ 0 to carry 4K resolution at 60 frames per second ( fps ) . Other features of HDMI 2 @.@ 0 include the options of the Rec . 2020 color space , Dual View , 4 : 2 : 0 chroma subsampling , 25 fps 3D formats , up to 4 audio streams , 21 : 9 aspect ratio , the HE @-@ AAC and DRA audio standards , dynamic auto lip @-@ sync , improved 3D capability , and additional CEC functions . 
 HDMI <unk> was released on April 8 , 2015 and added support for high dynamic range ( HDR ) video . 
 Version 2 @.@ 1 
 HDMI 2 @.@ 1 adds support for " dynamic metadata , " according to a white paper written by Philips . 
 In short : " HDMI <unk> covers HDR <unk> signaling and static metadata . Dynamic metadata is to be covered in HDMI 2 @.@ 1 . " 
 There has yet to be an important feature that HDMI can support the teletext and closed captioning to extend their columns from 32 to 60 in order to mainstream the 21 : 9 aspect ratio in the future .

 Note that a given product may choose to implement a subset of the given HDMI version . Certain features such as deep color and xvYCC are optional . 
 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Blu @-@ ray Disc and HD DVD players = = = 
 Blu @-@ ray Disc and HD DVD , introduced in 2006 , offer high @-@ fidelity audio features that require HDMI for best results . HDMI 1 @.@ 3 can transport Dolby Digital Plus , Dolby TrueHD , and DTS @-@ HD Master Audio <unk> in compressed form . This capability allows for an AV receiver with the necessary decoder to decode the compressed audio stream . The Blu @-@ ray specification does not include video encoded with either deep color or xvYCC ; thus , HDMI 1 @.@ 0 can transfer Blu @-@ ray discs at full video quality . 
 The HDMI 1 @.@ 4 specification ( released in 2009 ) added support for 3D video and is used by all Blu @-@ ray 3D compatible players . 
 The Blu @-@ ray Disc Association ( BDA ) spokespersons have stated ( Sept . 2014 at IFA show in Berlin , Germany ) that the Blu @-@ ray , 4K / Ultra HD players , and UHD discs are expected to be available starting in the second half to 2015 . It is anticipated that such Blu @-@ ray UHD players will be required to include a HDMI 2 @.@ 0 output supporting HDCP 2 @.@ 2 . 
 Blu @-@ ray permits secondary audio decoding , whereby the disc content can tell the player to mix multiple audio sources together before final output . Some Blu @-@ ray and HD DVD players can decode all of the audio codecs internally and can output LPCM audio over HDMI . Multichannel LPCM can be transported over an HDMI connection , and as long as the AV receiver implements multichannel LPCM audio over HDMI and implements HDCP , the audio reproduction is equal in resolution to HDMI 1 @.@ 3 bitstream output . Some low @-@ cost AV receivers , such as the <unk> TX @-@ <unk> , do not allow audio processing over HDMI and are labelled as " HDMI pass through " devices . [ 10 / 2014 Update ] Virtually all modern AV Receivers now offer HDMI 1 @.@ 4 inputs and output ( s ) with processing for all of the audio formats offered by Blu @-@ ray Discs and other HD video sources . During 2014 several manufacturers introduced premium AV Receivers that include one , or multiple , HDMI 2 @.@ 0 inputs along with a HDMI 2 @.@ 0 output ( s ) . However , it was not until 2015 that most major manufacturers of AV receivers also included support for HDCP 2 @.@ 2 as will be needed to support certain high quality 4K / UHD video sources , such as the upcoming Blu @-@ ray 4K / UHD players . 
 = = = Digital cameras and camcorders = = = 
 As of 2012 , most consumer camcorders , as well as many digital cameras , are equipped with a mini @-@ HDMI connector ( type C connector ) . 
 As of 2014 , some cameras also have 4K capability and 3D , even some cameras costing less than $ 900 . It needs at least a TV / monitor with HDMI 1.4a port . 
 = = = Personal computers = = = 
 PCs with a DVI interface are capable of video output to an HDMI @-@ enabled monitor . Some PCs include an HDMI interface and may also be capable of HDMI audio output , depending on specific hardware . For example , Intel 's motherboard chipsets since the <unk> and NVIDIA ’ s GeForce 8200 / 8300 motherboard chipsets are capable of 8 @-@ channel LPCM output over HDMI . Eight @-@ channel LPCM audio output over HDMI with a video card was first seen with the ATI Radeon HD <unk> , which was released in June 2008 and is implemented by other video cards in the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series . Linux can drive 8 @-@ channel LPCM audio over HDMI if the video card has the necessary hardware and implements the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture ( <unk> ) . The ATI Radeon HD 4000 series implements <unk> . <unk> announced in June 2008 that they would update their PowerDVD playback software to allow 192 kHz / 24 @-@ bit Blu @-@ ray Disc audio decoding in Q3 @-@ Q4 of 2008 . Corel 's WinDVD 9 Plus currently has 96 kHz / 24 @-@ bit Blu @-@ ray Disc audio decoding . 
 Even with an HDMI output , a computer may not be able to produce signals that implement HDCP , Microsoft 's Protected Video Path , or Microsoft 's Protected Audio Path . Several early graphic cards were labelled as " HDCP @-@ enabled " but did not have the hardware needed for HDCP ; this included some graphic cards based on the ATI <unk> chipset and certain models of the NVIDIA Geforce 7900 series . The first computer monitors that could process HDCP were released in 2005 ; by February 2006 a dozen different models had been released . The Protected Video Path was enabled in graphic cards that had HDCP capability , since it was required for output of Blu @-@ ray Disc video . In comparison , the Protected Audio Path was required only if a lossless audio bitstream ( such as Dolby TrueHD or DTS @-@ HD MA ) was output . <unk> LPCM audio , however , does not require a Protected Audio Path , and software programs such as PowerDVD and WinDVD can decode Dolby TrueHD and DTS @-@ HD MA and output it as LPCM . A limitation is that if the computer does not implement a Protected Audio Path , the audio must be <unk> to 16 @-@ bit 48 kHz but can still output at up to 8 channels . No graphic cards were released in 2008 that implemented the Protected Audio Path . 
 The Asus <unk> <unk> became the first HDMI sound card that implemented the Protected Audio Path and could both bitstream and decode lossless audio ( Dolby TrueHD and DTS @-@ HD MA ) , although <unk> is only available if using the <unk> <unk> Theatre software . It has an HDMI 1 @.@ 3 input / output , and Asus says that it can work with most video cards on the market . 
 In September 2009 , AMD announced the ATI Radeon HD 5000 series video cards , which have HDMI 1 @.@ 3 output ( deep color , xvYCC wide gamut capability and high bit rate audio ) , 8 @-@ channel LPCM over HDMI , and an integrated HD audio controller with a Protected Audio Path that allows bitstream output over HDMI for AAC , Dolby AC @-@ 3 , Dolby TrueHD and DTS Master Audio formats . The ATI Radeon HD <unk> released in September 2009 is the first video card that allows bitstream output over HDMI for Dolby TrueHD and DTS @-@ HD Master Audio . The AMD Radeon HD 6000 Series implements HDMI <unk> The AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series implements HDMI <unk> 
 In December 2010 , it was announced that several computer vendors and display makers including Intel , AMD , Dell , Lenovo , Samsung , and LG would stop using <unk> ( actually , <unk> @-@ Link ) from 2013 and legacy DVI and VGA connectors from 2015 , replacing them with DisplayPort and HDMI . 
 On August 27 , 2012 , Asus announced a new 27 in ( 69 cm ) monitor which can produce its native resolution of 2560 × 1440 via HDMI 1 @.@ 4 . 
 On September 18 , 2014 , Nvidia launched GeForce GTX 980 and GTX 970 ( with <unk> chip ) with HDMI 2 @.@ 0 support . On January 22 , 2015 , GeForce GTX 960 ( with <unk> chip ) launched with HDMI 2 @.@ 0 support . On March 17 , 2015 , GeForce GTX <unk> X ( <unk> ) launched with HDMI 2 @.@ 0 support . On June 1 , 2015 , GeForce GTX 980 Ti ( with <unk> chip ) launched with HDMI 2 @.@ 0 support . On August 20 , 2015 , GeForce GTX 950 ( with <unk> chip ) launched with HDMI 2 @.@ 0 support .

 = = = Tablet computers = = = 
 Some Tablet computers , such as the Microsoft Surface , Motorola <unk> , BlackBerry <unk> , <unk> <unk> 1008 and Acer <unk> Tab A500 , implement HDMI using Micro @-@ HDMI ( Type D ) ports . Others , such as the ASUS <unk> Pad Transformer implement the standard using Mini @-@ HDMI ( Type C ) ports . All iPad models have a special A / V adapter that converts Apple 's data line to a standard HDMI ( Type A ) port . Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty @-@ pin port for their Galaxy Tab 10 @.@ 1 that can adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives . The Dell Streak 5 smartphone / tablet hybrid is capable of outputting over HDMI . While the Streak uses a <unk> port , a separate cradle is available which adds HDMI compatibility . Most of the Chinese @-@ made tablets running Android OS provide HDMI output using a Mini @-@ HDMI ( Type C ) port . Most new laptops and desktops now have built in HDMI as well . 
 = = = Mobile phones = = = 
 Many recent mobile phones can produce output of HDMI video via either a micro @-@ HDMI connector or MHL output . 
 = = = Legacy compatibility = = = 
 HDMI can only be used with older analog @-@ only devices ( using connections such as SCART , VGA , RCA , etc . ) by means of a digital @-@ to @-@ analog converter or AV receiver , as the interface does not carry any analog signals ( unlike DVI , where devices with DVI @-@ I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals ) . Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics , but it is important to distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables ( which are typically cheaper as they don 't include any electronics ) . The passive cables are only useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector , or VGA signals on an HDMI connector ; this is a non @-@ standard feature , not implemented by most devices . 
 = = Relationship with DisplayPort = = 
 Another audio / video interface is DisplayPort , version 1 @.@ 0 , which was approved in May 2006 . Several models of display , computer , and video cards have DisplayPort ports . The DisplayPort website states that DisplayPort is expected to complement HDMI . Most of the companies producing equipment that uses DisplayPort are in the computer sector . DisplayPort uses a self @-@ clocking , micro @-@ packet @-@ based protocol that allows for a variable number of differential lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video , and allows encapsulating multichannel compressed audio formats in the audio stream . DisplayPort ports can be made so that they are compatible with single @-@ link DVI and HDMI 1 @.@ 4 . Compatibility is achieved with DisplayPort Dual @-@ mode ports , which are marked with the + + DP logo , using attached passive adapters ; powered active adapters allow signal conversion to dual @-@ link DVI and analog VGA . 
 DisplayPort has a royalty rate of $ 0 @.@ 20 per unit ( from patents licensed by MPEG LA ) while HDMI has an annual fee of $ 10 @,@ 000 and a per unit royalty rate of between $ 0 @.@ 15 and $ 0 @.@ 04 . DisplayPort version 1 @.@ 2 added the ability to transport multiple audio / video streams , doubled the maximum data rate from 10 @.@ 8 Gbit / s to 21 @.@ 6 Gbit / s , increased the " AUX " channel bandwidth from 1 Mbit / s to 720 Mbit / s , added the ability to use multiple color spaces , including xvYCC , <unk> and Adobe RGB 1998 , added global time @-@ code for audio synchronisation and the ability to transfer Ethernet , USB 2 @.@ 0 , <unk> , and other types of data over the " AUX " channel . 
 HDMI has a few advantages over DisplayPort , such as ability to carry Consumer Electronics Control ( CEC ) signals , and electrical compatibility with DVI ( though practically limited to single @-@ link DVI rates ) . More importantly , HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length , while DisplayPort can carry full bandwidth for up to 3 meters only . 
 = = Relationship with MHL = = 
 Mobile High @-@ definition Link ( MHL ) is an industry standard for a mobile audio / video interface for directly connecting mobile phones and other portable consumer electronics ( CE ) devices to high @-@ definition televisions ( HDTVs ) and displays . MHL is developed by the MHL Consortium , a consortium of manufacturers of mobile electronics , several of which are also behind HDMI . 
 MHL features include : 
 Power is transmitted through the cable . Typical cases include the TV charging the mobile device and the mobile device powering an active MHL to HDMI <unk> . 
 Uses a single , thin cable to connect the mobile device to the TV compared to HDMI . Typical MHL cables are 1 @.@ 5 m long . 
 HDMI @-@ CEC capability . 
 Video resolution limited to 1080p uncompressed 4 : 2 : 2 HD video ( <unk> ) or 720p 4 : 4 : 4 HD video . MHL 2 @.@ 0 provides for 1080p at 60 Hz . 
 8 channel ( e.g. , 7 @.@ 1 surround sound ) uncompressed audio . 
 Allows High @-@ bandwidth Digital Content Protection ( HDCP ) . 
 Typical MHL connector is micro USB , a typical connector already found in many mobile devices . The same micro USB connector can be used to charge the device , to establish data communication with a computer and to transfer uncompressed video . 
 The superMHL specification was announced on January 6 , 2015 . <unk> supports higher video resolution and frame rates , additional audio formats and <unk> of power charging , along with a new reversible connector . 
 Features of superMHL include : 
 Up to 8K <unk> video .

 = Ingeborg Steinholt = 
 Ingeborg Haug Steinholt ( born 16 July 1986 ) is a Norwegian politician for the Red Party , and since 2007 a member of Nordland County Council . Steinholt was a member of the Central Committee of Red Youth ( RU ) from 2006 to 2010 . She was also a member of the Central Board of Directors of Red Youth . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 Steinholt was born in Sandnessjøen . She later moved to Oslo to study nursing , and works there as a nursing assistant . Steinholt has residences in Oslo and Sandnessjøen . She is currently studying medicine in Tromsø . She stands for a more liberal policy regarding vocational education , and wants to remove much unneeded theory in such subjects . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Steinholt started her political career as a member of Red Youth , and later became a member of its mother party , Red . In 2007 Steinholt was elected as Red Nordland 's leading candidate in the local elections of 2007 . Steinholt had a very short election campaign , but she managed to make several notable appearances . Steinholt focused on environmental issues during the campaign , and opposed the establishment of a petroleum plant in northern Norway . Under her leadership , Red <unk> received 2 @,@ 956 votes , 3 @.@ 0 percent of the votes , an increase of 0 @.@ 9 % from the previous local election in 2003 . Red won another seat on the Nordland County Council during the election ; Steinholt became the youngest member of the council . 
 One of Steinholt 's campaign promises was to put an end to the activities of the petroleum industry close to Lofoten and Vesterålen because of potentially hazardous effects on the environment . When asked if she had any political allies in parliament who could help her , Steinholt replied , " Our most important partners are not in Parliament [ but instead ] those organisations whose main goal is to improve conditions for the Norwegian people . We must ensure that the Public Action For an Oil @-@ Free Lofoten and Vesterålen will be heard " . 
 In November 2009 <unk> Municipality cut the budgets of youth organisations by an estimated NOK 400 @,@ 000 . Steinholt opposed this , saying that if the wages of the mayor and several other high @-@ ranking politicians had been cut , the municipality could have saved NOK 487 @,@ 000 . In the 2009 parliamentary election Steinholt received 1 @,@ 829 votes , again as Red Nordland 's leading candidate . 
 She was elected a member of Red Youth 's Central Board in 2006 ; her term expired in 2010 . In 2008 Steinholt became a member of Red Youth 's National Board ; her term expired in 2010 .

 Steinholt has stated that she feels the government should reduce unnecessary theory in the vocational education programme in upper secondary school ; she believes it to be the main reason why an increasing numbers of pupils are dropping out of school . The Norwegian Government , Steinholt believes , should increase their funding for vocational education programmes and jobs ; she states that people with this type of education " are the cornerstone of our society " . Steinholt believes there is a broad consensus in the labor movement that the Contractual Pension ( <unk> <unk> ) bill holds a hostile policy towards the working class . <unk> led to a debate in the City Council , mainly between Steinholt and County Cabinet leader Odd Eriksen . She believed it would be disrespectful towards workers to deprive them the right of a dignified work age , feeling that forcing them to quit their jobs at the age of 62 is too early . 
 She is strongly opposed to oil drilling in Lofoten , arguing that oil drilling would lead to conditions hazardous to the area . In July 2009 she told <unk> that the government should give emergency funding to Norwegian companies who work on developing renewable energy instead of just giving it to the banks . 
 Steinholt does not believe that small municipalities should be merged because of their economic problems . She feels the government focus on the struggling economy of the municipalities should be towards cleaning up their debt . In 2008 alone , the municipalities of Norway had a gathered debt of NOK 20 @.@ 7 billion .

 State Route 98 ( SR 98 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California . It is a loop of Interstate 8 ( I @-@ 8 ) running west to east south of the Interstate through the border city of Calexico . It passes through the city of Calexico and ends east of Holtville . The highway was added to the state highway system in 1933 , and signed as Route 98 by 1938 . The highway was paved and rerouted to its current path during the 1950s .

 = Battlecruiser = 
 A battlecruiser , or battle cruiser , was a capital ship built in the first half of the 20th century . They were similar in size , cost , and carried similar armament to battleships , but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds . The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century , as a development of the armoured cruiser , at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre @-@ dreadnought battleship . The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament , and chase down any ship with lesser armament ; they were intended to hunt down slower , older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships . However , as more and more battlecruisers were built , they were increasingly used alongside the better @-@ protected battleships . 
 Battlecruisers served in the navies of Britain , Germany , the Ottoman Empire , Australia and Japan during World War I , most notably at the Battle of the Falkland Islands and in the several raids and skirmishes in the North Sea which culminated in a pitched fleet battle , the Battle of Jutland . British battlecruisers in particular suffered heavy losses at Jutland , where their light armour made them very vulnerable to large @-@ caliber shells . By the end of the war , capital ship design had developed with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured , blurring the distinction between a battlecruiser and a fast battleship . The Washington Naval Treaty , which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards , treated battleships and battlecruisers identically , and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped under the terms of the treaty . 
 From the 1930s on , only the Royal Navy continued to use ' battlecruiser ' as a classification for the World War I @-@ era capital ships that remained in the fleet ; while Japan 's battlecruisers remained in service , they had been significantly reconstructed and were re @-@ rated as full @-@ fledged battleships . 
 Battlecruisers were put into action again during World War II , and only one survived to the end . There was also renewed interest in large " cruiser @-@ killer " type warships , but few were ever begun , as construction of battleships and battlecruisers were curtailed in favor of more @-@ needed convoy escorts , aircraft carriers , and cargo ships . In the post – Cold War era , the Soviet Kirov class of large guided missile cruisers have also been termed " battlecruisers " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The battlecruiser was developed by the Royal Navy in the first years of the 20th century as an evolution of the armoured cruiser . 
 The first armoured cruisers had been built in the 1870s , as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical cruiser roles of patrol , trade protection and power projection . However , the results were rarely satisfactory , as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship . As a result , navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck protecting their engines , or simply no armour at all . 
 In the 1890s , technology began to change this balance . New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick @-@ firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike . In 1896 – 97 France and Russia , who were regarded as likely allies in the event of war , started to build large , fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this . In the event of a war between Britain and France or Russia , or both , these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire 's worldwide trade . 
 Britain , which had concluded in 1892 that it needed twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire 's sea lanes , responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers . Between 1899 and 1905 , it completed or laid down seven classes of this type , a total of 35 ships . This building program , in turn , prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction . The Imperial German Navy began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations , laying down eight between 1897 and 1906 . 
 The cost of this cruiser arms race was significant . In the period 1889 – 96 , the Royal Navy spent £ 7 @.@ 3 million on new large cruisers . From 1897 – 1904 , it spent £ 26 @.@ 9 million . Many armoured cruisers of the new kind were just as large and expensive as the equivalent battleship . 
 The increasing size and power of the armoured cruiser led to suggestions in British naval circles that cruisers should displace battleships entirely . The battleship 's main advantage was its 12 @-@ inch heavy guns , and heavier armour designed to protect from shells of similar size . However , for a few years after 1900 it seemed that those advantages were of little practical value . The torpedo now had a range of 2 @,@ 000 yards , and it seemed unlikely that a battleship would engage within torpedo range . However , at ranges of more than 2 @,@ 000 yards it became increasingly unlikely that the heavy guns of a battleship would score any hits , as the heavy guns relied on primitive aiming techniques . The secondary batteries of 6 @-@ inch quick @-@ firing guns , firing more plentiful shells , were more likely to hit the enemy . As naval expert Fred T. Jane wrote in June 1902 @,@ 
 Is there anything outside of 2 @,@ 000 yards that the big gun in its hundreds of tons of medieval castle can effect , that its weight in 6 @-@ inch guns without the castle could not effect equally well ? And inside 2 @,@ 000 , what , in these days of gyros , is there that the torpedo cannot effect with far more certainty ? 
 In 1904 , Admiral John " Jacky " Fisher became First Sea Lord , the senior officer of the Royal Navy . He had for some time thought about the development of a new fast armoured ship . He was very fond of the " second @-@ class battleship " Renown , a faster , more lightly armoured battleship . As early as 1901 , there is confusion in Fisher 's writing about whether he saw the battleship or the cruiser as the model for future developments . This did not stop him from commissioning designs from naval architect W. H. Gard for an armoured cruiser with the heaviest possible armament for use with the fleet . The design Gard submitted was for a ship between 14 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 long tons ( 14 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 t ) , capable of 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) , armed with four 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch and twelve 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 190 mm ) guns in twin gun turrets and protected with six inches of armour along her belt and 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch turrets , 4 inches ( 102 mm ) on her 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch turrets , 10 inches on her conning tower and up to 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) on her decks . However , mainstream British naval thinking between 1902 and 1904 was clearly in favour of heavily armoured battleships , rather than the fast ships that Fisher favoured . 
 The Battle of Tsushima proved conclusively the effectiveness of heavy guns over intermediate ones and the need for a uniform main caliber on a ship for fire control . Even before this , the Royal Navy had begun to consider a shift away from the mixed @-@ calibre armament of the 1890s pre @-@ dreadnought to an " all @-@ big @-@ gun " design , and preliminary designs circulated for battleships with all 12 @-@ inch or all 10 @-@ inch guns and armoured cruisers with all 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch guns . In late 1904 , not long after the Royal Navy had decided to use 12 @-@ inch guns for its next generation of battleships because of their superior performance at long range , Fisher began to argue that big @-@ gun cruisers could replace battleships altogether . The continuing improvement of the torpedo meant that submarines and destroyers would be able to destroy battleships ; this in Fisher 's view heralded the end of the battleship or at least compromised the validity of heavy armour protection . Nevertheless , armoured cruisers would remain vital for commerce protection . 
 Of what use is a battle fleet to a country called ( A ) at war with a country called ( B ) possessing no battleships , but having fast armoured cruisers and clouds of fast torpedo craft ? What damage would ( A 's ) battleships do to ( B ) ? Would ( B ) wish for a few battleships or for more armoured cruisers ? Would not ( A ) willingly exchange a few battleships for more fast armoured cruisers ? In such a case , neither side wanting battleships is presumptive evidence that they are not of much value . 
 Fisher 's views were very controversial within the Royal Navy , and even given his position as First Sea Lord , he was not in a position to insist on his own approach . Thus he assembled a " Committee on Designs " , consisting of a mixture of civilian and naval experts , to determine the approach to both battleship and armoured cruiser construction in the future . While the stated purpose of the Committee was to investigate and report on future requirements of ships , Fisher and his associates had already made key decisions . The terms of reference for the Committee were for a battleship capable of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) with 12 @-@ inch guns and no intermediate calibres , capable of docking in existing drydocks ; and a cruiser capable of 25 @.@ 5 knots ( 47 @.@ 2 km / h ; 29 @.@ 3 mph ) , also with 12 @-@ inch guns and no intermediate armament , armoured like Minotaur , the most recent armoured cruiser , and also capable of using existing docks . 
 = = First battlecruisers = = 
 Under the Selborne plan of 1902 , the Royal Navy intended to start three new battleships and four armoured cruisers each year . However , in late 1904 it became clear that the 1905 – 06 programme would have to be considerably smaller , because of lower than expected tax revenue and the need to buy out two Chilean battleships under construction in British yards , lest they be purchased by the Russians for use against the Japanese , Britain 's ally . These economies meant that the 1905 – 06 programme consisted only of one battleship , but three armoured cruisers . The battleship became the revolutionary battleship Dreadnought , and the cruisers became the three ships of the Invincible class . Fisher later claimed , however , that he had argued during the Committee for the cancellation of the remaining battleship . 
 The construction of the new class were begun in 1906 and completed in 1908 , delayed perhaps to allow their designers to learn from any problems with Dreadnought . The ships fulfilled the design requirement quite closely . On a displacement similar to Dreadnought , the Invincibles were 40 feet ( 12 @.@ 2 m ) longer to accommodate additional boilers and more powerful turbines to propel them at 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . Moreover , the new ships could maintain this speed for days , whereas pre @-@ dreadnought battleships could not generally do so for more than an hour . Armed with eight 12 @-@ inch Mk X guns , compared to ten on Dreadnought , they had 6 – 7 inches ( 152 – 178 mm ) of armour protecting the hull and the gun turrets . ( Dreadnought 's armour , by comparison , was 11 – 12 inches ( 279 – 305 mm ) at its thickest . ) The class had a very marked increase in speed , displacement and firepower compared to the most recent armoured cruisers but no more armour . 
 While the Invincibles were to fill the same role as the armoured cruisers they succeeded , they were expected to do so more effectively . Specifically their roles were : 
 Heavy reconnaissance . Because of their power , the Invincibles could sweep away the screen of enemy cruisers to close with and observe an enemy battlefleet before using their superior speed to retire . 
 Close support for the battle fleet . They could be stationed at the ends of the battle line to stop enemy cruisers harassing the battleships , and to harass the enemy 's battleships if they were busy fighting battleships . Also , the Invincibles could operate as the fast wing of the battlefleet and try to <unk> the enemy . 
 Pursuit . If an enemy fleet ran , then the Invincibles would use their speed to pursue , and their guns to damage or slow enemy ships . 
 Commerce protection . The new ships would hunt down enemy cruisers and commerce raiders . 
 Confusion about how to refer to these new battleship @-@ size armoured cruisers set in almost immediately . Even in late 1905 , before work was begun on the Invincibles , a Royal Navy memorandum refers to " large armoured ships " meaning both battleships and large cruisers . In October 1906 , the Admiralty began to classify all post @-@ Dreadnought battleships and armoured cruisers as " capital ships " , while Fisher used the term " dreadnought " to refer either to his new battleships or the battleships and armoured cruisers together . At the same time , the Invincible class themselves were referred to as " cruiser @-@ battleships " , " dreadnought cruisers " ; the term " battlecruiser " was first used by Fisher in 1908 . Finally , on 24 November 1911 , Admiralty Weekly Order No. 351 laid down that " All cruisers of the “ Invincible ” and later types are for the future to be described and classified as “ battle cruisers ” to distinguish them from the armoured cruisers of earlier date . " 
 Along with questions over the new ships ' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection . If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter @-@ killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders , then the seven inches of belt armour with which they had been equipped would be adequate . If , on the other hand , they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns , they were too thin @-@ skinned to be safe from an enemy 's heavy guns . The Invincibles were essentially extremely large , heavily armed , fast armoured cruisers . However , the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt . A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role . 
 Because of the Invincibles ' size and armament , naval authorities considered them capital ships almost from their inception — an assumption that might have been inevitable . Complicating matters further was that many naval authorities , including Lord Fisher , had made <unk> assessments from the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 about the armoured cruiser 's ability to survive in a battle line against enemy capital ships due to their superior speed . These assumptions had been made without taking into account the Russian Baltic Fleet 's inefficiency and tactical ineptitude . By the time the term " battlecruiser " had been given to the Invincibles , the idea of their parity with battleships had been fixed in many people 's minds . 
 Not everyone was so convinced . Brassey 's Naval Annual , for instance , stated that with vessels as large and expensive as the Invincibles , an admiral " will be certain to put them in the line of battle where their comparatively light protection will be a disadvantage and their high speed of no value . " Those in favor of the battlecruiser countered with two points — first , since all capital ships were vulnerable to new weapons such as the torpedo , armour had lost some of its validity ; and second , because of its greater speed , the battlecruiser could control the range at which it engaged an enemy . 
 = = Battlecruisers in the dreadnought arms race = = 
 Between the launching of the Invincibles to just after the outbreak of the First World War , the battlecruiser played a junior role in the developing dreadnought arms race , as it was never wholeheartedly adopted as the key weapon in British imperial defence , as Fisher had presumably desired . The biggest factor for this lack of acceptance was the marked change in Britain 's strategic circumstances between their conception and the commissioning of the first ships . The prospective enemy for Britain had shifted from a Franco @-@ Russian alliance with many armoured cruisers to a resurgent and increasingly belligerent Germany . <unk> , Britain had entered the Entente cordiale in 1904 and the Anglo @-@ Russian Entente . Neither France nor Russia posed a particular naval threat ; the Russian navy had largely been sunk or captured in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 5 , while the French were in no hurry to adopt the new dreadnought @-@ type design . Britain also boasted very cordial relations with two of the significant new naval powers , Japan ( bolstered by the Anglo @-@ Japanese Alliance , signed in 1902 and renewed in 1905 ) , and the USA . These changed strategic circumstances , and the great success of the Dreadnought , ensured that she rather than the Invincible became the new model capital ship . Nevertheless , battlecruiser construction played a part in the renewed naval arms @-@ race sparked by the Dreadnought . 
 For their first few years of service , the Invincibles entirely fulfilled Fisher 's vision of being able to sink any ship fast enough to catch them , and run from any ship capable of sinking them . An Invincible would also , in many circumstances , be able to take on an enemy pre @-@ dreadnought battleship . Naval circles concurred that the armoured cruiser in its current form had come to the logical end of its development and the Invincibles were so far ahead of any enemy armoured cruiser in firepower and speed that it proved difficult to justify building more or bigger cruisers . This lead was extended by the surprise both Dreadnought and Invincible produced by having been built in secret ; this prompted most other navies to delay their building programmes and radically revise their designs . This was particularly true for cruisers , because the details of the Invincible class were kept secret for longer ; this meant that the last German armoured cruiser , Blücher , was armed with only 21 @-@ centimetre ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) guns , and was no match for the new battlecruisers . 
 The Royal Navy 's early superiority in capital ships led to the rejection of a 1905 – 06 design that would , essentially , have fused the battlecruiser and battleship concepts into what would eventually become the fast battleship . The ' X4 ' design combined the full armour and armament of Dreadnought with the 25 knot speed of Invincible . The additional cost could not be justified given the existing British lead and the new Liberal government 's need for economy ; the slower and cheaper Bellerophon , a relatively close copy of Dreadnought , was adopted instead . The X4 concept would eventually be fulfilled in the Queen Elizabeth class and later by other navies . 
 The next British battlecruisers were the three Indefatigable class , slightly improved Invincibles built to fundamentally the same specification , partly due to political pressure to limit costs and partly due to the secrecy surrounding German battlecruiser construction , particularly about the heavy armour of SMS Von der Tann . This class came to be widely seen as a mistake and the next generation of British battlecruisers were markedly more powerful . By 1909 – 10 a sense of national crisis about rivalry with Germany outweighed cost @-@ cutting , and a naval panic resulted in the approval of a total of eight capital ships in 1909 – 10 . Fisher pressed for all eight to be battlecruisers , but was unable to have his way ; he had to settle for six battleships and two battlecruisers of the Lion class . The Lions carried eight 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns , the now @-@ standard caliber of the British " super @-@ dreadnought " battleships . Speed increased to 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) and armour protection , while not as good as in German designs , was better than in previous British battlecruisers , with nine @-@ inch ( 230 mm ) armour belt and barbettes . The two Lions were followed by the very similar Queen Mary . 
 By 1911 Germany had built battlecruisers of her own , and the superiority of the British ships could no longer be assured . Moreover , the German Navy did not share Fisher 's view of the battlecruiser . In contrast to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower , Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers . Von der Tann , begun in 1908 and completed in 1910 , carried eight 11 @.@ 1 @-@ inch guns , but with 11 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 283 mm ) armour she was far better protected than the Invincibles . The two Moltkes were quite similar but carried ten 11 @.@ 1 @-@ inch guns of an improved design . Seydlitz , designed in 1909 and finished in 1913 , was a modified Moltke ; speed increased by one knot to 26 @.@ 5 knots ( 49 @.@ 1 km / h ; 30 @.@ 5 mph ) , while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches , equivalent to the Helgoland @-@ class battleships of a few years earlier . Seydlitz was Germany 's last battlecruiser completed before World War I. 
 The next step in battlecruiser design came from Japan . The Imperial Japanese Navy had been planning the Kongō @-@ class ships from 1909 , and was determined that , since the Japanese economy could support relatively few ships , each would be more powerful than its likely competitors . Initially the class was planned with the Invincibles as the benchmark . On learning of the British plans for Lion , and the likelihood that new U.S. Navy battleships would be armed with 14 @-@ inch ( 360 mm ) guns , the Japanese decided to radically revise their plans and go one better . A new plan was drawn up , carrying eight 14 @-@ inch guns , and capable of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) , thus marginally having the edge over the Lions in speed and firepower . The heavy guns were also better @-@ positioned , being superfiring both fore and aft with no turret amidships . The armour scheme was also marginally improved over the Lions , with nine inches of armour on the turrets and 8 inches ( 203 mm ) on the barbettes . The first ship in the class was built in Britain , and a further three constructed in Japan . The Japanese also re @-@ classified their powerful armoured cruisers of the Tsukuba and Ibuki classes , carrying four 12 @-@ inch guns , as battlecruisers ; nonetheless , their armament was weaker and they were slower than any battlecruiser . 
 The next British battlecruiser , Tiger , was intended initially as the fourth ship in the Lion class , but was substantially redesigned . She retained the eight 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns of her predecessors , but they were positioned like those of Kongō for better fields of fire . She was faster ( making 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) on sea trials ) , and carried a heavier secondary armament . Tiger was also more heavily armoured on the whole ; while the maximum thickness of armour was the same at nine inches , the height of the main armour belt was increased . Not all the desired improvements for this ship were approved , however . Her designer , Sir Eustace Tennyson d 'Eyncourt , had wanted small @-@ bore water @-@ tube boilers and geared turbines to give her a speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , but he received no support from the authorities and the engine makers refused his request . 
 1912 saw work begin on three more German battlecruisers of the Derfflinger class , the first German battlecruisers to mount 12 @-@ inch guns . These ships , like Tiger and the Kongōs , had their guns arranged in superfiring turrets for greater efficiency . Their armour and speed was similar to the previous Seydlitz class . In 1913 , the Russian Empire also began the construction of the four @-@ ship Borodino class , which were designed for service in the Baltic Sea . These ships were designed to carry twelve 14 @-@ inch guns , with armour up to 12 inches thick , and a speed of 26 @.@ 6 knots ( 49 @.@ 3 km / h ; 30 @.@ 6 mph ) . The heavy armour and relatively slow speed of these ships made them more similar to German designs than to British ships ; construction of the Borodinos was halted by the First World War and all were scrapped after the end of the Russian Civil War . 
 = = World War I = = 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 For most of the combatants , capital ship construction was very limited during the war . Germany finished the Derfflinger class and began work on the Mackensen class . The Mackensens were a development of the Derfflinger class , with 13 @.@ 8 @-@ inch guns and a broadly similar armour scheme , designed for 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . 
 In Britain , Jackie Fisher returned to the office of First Sea Lord in October 1914 . His enthusiasm for big , fast ships was unabated , and he set designers to producing a design for a battlecruiser with 15 @-@ inch guns . Because Fisher expected the next German battlecruiser to steam at 28 knots , he required the new British design to be capable of 32 knots . He planned to reorder two Revenge @-@ class battleships , which had been approved but not yet laid down , to a new design . Fisher finally received approval for this project on 28 December 1914 and they became the Renown class . With six 15 @-@ inch guns but only 6 @-@ inch armour they were a further step forward from Tiger in firepower and speed , but returned to the level of protection of the first British battlecruisers . 
 At the same time , Fisher resorted to subterfuge to obtain another three fast , lightly armoured ships that could use several spare 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) gun turrets left over from battleship construction . These ships were essentially light battlecruisers , and Fisher occasionally referred to them as such , but officially they were classified as large light cruisers . This unusual designation was required because construction of new capital ships had been placed on hold , while there were no limits on light cruiser construction . They became Courageous and her sisters Glorious and Furious , and there was a bizarre imbalance between their main guns of 15 inches ( or 18 inches ( 457 mm ) in Furious ) and their armour , which at three inches ( 76 mm ) thickness was on the scale of a light cruiser . The design was generally regarded as a failure ( nicknamed in the Fleet Outrageous , <unk> and Spurious ) , though the later conversion of the ships to aircraft carriers was very successful . Fisher also speculated about a new mammoth , but lightly built battlecruiser , that would carry 20 @-@ inch ( 508 mm ) guns , which he termed HMS Incomparable ; this never got beyond the concept stage . 
 It is often held that the Renown and Courageous classes were designed for Fisher 's plan to land troops ( possibly Russian ) on the German Baltic coast . Specifically , they were designed with a reduced draught , which might be important in the shallow Baltic . This is not clear @-@ cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic : it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions . Roberts argues that the focus on the Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed , but was inflated later , after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign . 
 The final British battlecruiser design of the war was the Admiral class , which was born from a requirement for an improved version of the Queen Elizabeth battleship . The project began at the end of 1915 , after Fisher 's final departure from the Admiralty . While initially envisaged as a battleship , senior sea officers felt that Britain had enough battleships , but that new battlecruisers might be required to combat German ships being built ( the British overestimated German progress on the Mackensen class as well as their likely capabilities ) . A battlecruiser design with eight 15 @-@ inch guns , 8 inches of armour and capable of 32 knots was decided on . The experience of battlecruisers at the Battle of Jutland meant that the design was radically revised and transformed again into a fast battleship with armour up to 12 inches thick , but still capable of 31 @.@ 5 knots ( 58 @.@ 3 km / h ; 36 @.@ 2 mph ) . The first ship in the class , Hood , was built according to this design to counter the possible completion of any of the Mackensen @-@ class ship . The plans for her three sisters , on which little work had been done , were revised once more later in 1916 and in 1917 to improve protection . 
 The Admiral class would have been the only British ships capable of taking on the German Mackensen class ; nevertheless , German shipbuilding was drastically slowed by the war , and while two Mackensens were launched , none were ever completed . The Germans also worked briefly on a further three ships , of the Ersatz Yorck class , which were modified versions of the Mackensens with 15 @-@ inch guns . Work on the three additional Admirals was suspended in March 1917 to enable more escorts and merchant ships to be built to deal with the new threat from U @-@ boats to trade . They were finally cancelled in February 1919 . 
 = = = Battlecruisers in action = = = 
 The first combat involving battlecruisers during World War I was the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 . A force of British light cruisers and destroyers entered the Heligoland Bight ( the part of the North Sea closest to Hamburg ) to attack German destroyer patrols . When they met opposition from light cruisers , Vice Admiral David Beatty took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the Bight and turned the tide of the battle , ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander , Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass . 
 The German battlecruiser Goeben perhaps made the most impact early in the war . Stationed in the Mediterranean , she and the escorting light cruiser SMS Breslau evaded British and French ships on the outbreak of war , and steamed to Constantinople ( Istanbul ) with two British battlecruisers in hot pursuit . The two German ships were handed over to the Ottoman Navy , and this was instrumental in bringing the Ottoman Empire into the war as one of the Central Powers . Goeben herself , renamed Yavuz Sultan Selim , fought engagements against the Imperial Russian Navy in the Black Sea and against the British in the Aegean Sea . 
 The original battlecruiser concept proved successful in December 1914 at the Battle of the Falkland Islands . The British battlecruisers Inflexible and Invincible did precisely the job for which they were intended when they chased down and annihilated the German East Asia Squadron , centered on the armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau , along with three light cruisers , commanded by Admiral Maximilian Graf Von Spee , in the South Atlantic Ocean . Prior to the battle , the Australian battlecruiser Australia had unsuccessfully searched for the German ships in the Pacific . 
 During the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915 , the aftermost barbette of the German flagship Seydlitz was struck by a British 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch shell from HMS Lion . The shell did not penetrate the barbette , but it dislodged a piece of the barbette armour that allowed the flame from the shell 's detonation to enter the barbette . The propellant charges being hoisted upwards were ignited , and the fireball flashed up into the turret and down into the magazine , setting fire to charges removed from their brass cartridge cases . The gun crew tried to escape into the next turret , which allowed the flash to spread into that turret as well , killing the crews of both turrets . Seydlitz was saved from near @-@ certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines , which had been effected by Wilhelm Heidkamp . This near @-@ disaster was due to the way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both German and British battleships and battlecruisers , but the lighter protection on the latter made them more vulnerable to the turret or barbette being penetrated . The Germans learned from investigating the damaged Seydlitz and instituted measures to ensure that ammunition handling minimised any possible exposure to flash . 
 Apart from the cordite handling , the battle was mostly inconclusive , though both the British flagship Lion and Seydlitz were severely damaged . Lion lost speed , causing her to fall behind the rest of the battleline , and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships for the remainder of the engagement . A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw , as most of Beatty 's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser Blücher , sinking her with great loss of life . The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes . 
 At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 , both British and German battlecruisers were employed as fleet units . The British battlecruisers became engaged with both their German counterparts , the battlecruisers , and then German battleships before the arrival of the battleships of the British Grand Fleet . The result was a disaster for the Royal Navy 's battlecruiser squadrons : Invincible , Queen Mary , and Indefatigable exploded with the loss of all but a handful of their crews . The exact reason why the ships ' magazines detonated is not known , but the plethora of exposed cordite charges stored in their turrets , ammunition hoists and working chambers in the quest to increase their rate of fire undoubtedly contributed to their loss . Beatty 's flagship Lion herself was almost lost in a similar manner , save for the heroic actions of Major Francis Harvey . 
 The better @-@ armoured German battlecruisers fared better , in part due to the poor performance of British fuzes ( the British shells tended to explode or break up on impact with the German armour ) . Lützow — the only German battlecruiser lost at Jutland — had only 128 killed , for instance , despite receiving more than thirty hits . The other German battlecruisers , Moltke , Von der Tann , Seydlitz , and Derfflinger , were all heavily damaged and required extensive repairs after the battle , Seydlitz barely making it home , for they had been the focus of British fire for much of the battle . 
 = = Interwar period = = 
 In the years immediately after World War I , Britain , Japan and the USA all began design work on a new generation of ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers . The new burst of shipbuilding that each nation 's navy desired was politically controversial and potentially economically crippling . This nascent arms race was prevented by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , where the major naval powers agreed to limits on capital ship numbers . The German navy was not represented at the talks ; under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , Germany was not allowed any modern capital ships at all . 
 Through the 1920s and 1930s only Britain and Japan retained battlecruisers , often modified and rebuilt from their original designs . The line between the battlecruiser and the modern fast battleship became blurred ; indeed , the Japanese Kongōs were formally redesignated as battleships . 
 = = = Plans in the aftermath of World War I = = = 
 Hood , launched in 1918 , was the last World War I battlecruiser to be completed . Owing to lessons from Jutland , the ship was modified during construction ; the thickness of her belt armour was increased by an average of 50 percent and extended substantially , she was given heavier deck armour , and the protection of her magazines was improved to guard against the ignition of ammunition . This was hoped to be capable of resisting her own weapons — the classic measure of a " balanced " battleship . Hood was the largest ship in the Royal Navy when completed ; thanks to her great displacement , in theory she combined the firepower and armour of a battleship with the speed of a battlecruiser , causing some to refer to her as a fast battleship . However her protection was markedly less than that of the British battleships built immediately after World War I , the Nelson class . 
 The navies of Japan and the United States , not being affected immediately by the war , had time to develop new heavy 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) guns for their latest designs and to refine their battlecruiser designs in light of combat experience in Europe . The Imperial Japanese Navy began four Amagi @-@ class battlecruisers . These vessels would have been of unprecedented size and power , as fast and well armoured as Hood whilst carrying a main battery of ten 16 @-@ inch guns , the most powerful armament ever proposed for a battlecruiser . They were , for all intents and purposes , fast battleships — the only differences between them and the Tosa @-@ class battleships which were to precede them were 1 inch ( 25 mm ) less side armour and a .25 knots ( 0 @.@ 46 km / h ; 0 @.@ 29 mph ) increase in speed . The United States Navy , which had worked on its battlecruiser designs since 1913 and watched the latest developments in this class with great care , responded with the Lexington class . If completed as planned , they would have been exceptionally fast and well armed with eight 16 @-@ inch guns , but carried armour little better than the Invincibles — this after an 8 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 8 @,@ 100 t ) increase in protection following Jutland . The final stage in the post @-@ war battlecruiser race came with the British response to the Amagi and Lexington types : four 48 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 49 @,@ 000 t ) G3 battlecruisers . Royal Navy documents of the period often described any battleship with a speed of over about 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) as a battlecruiser , regardless of the amount of protective armour , although the G3 was considered by most to be a well @-@ balanced fast battleship . 
 The Washington Naval Treaty meant that none of these designs came to fruition . Ships that had been started were either broken up on the slipway or converted to aircraft carriers . In Japan , Amagi and Akagi were selected for conversion . Amagi was damaged beyond repair by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and was broken up for scrap ; the hull of one of the proposed Tosa @-@ class battleships , Kaga , was converted in her stead . The United States Navy also converted two battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers in the wake of the Washington Treaty : USS Lexington and USS Saratoga , although this was only considered marginally preferable to scrapping the hulls outright ( the remaining four : Constellation , Ranger , Constitution and United States were scrapped ) . In Britain , Fisher 's " large light cruisers , " were converted to carriers . Furious had already been partially converted during the war and Glorious and Courageous were similarly converted . 
 = = = Rebuilding programmes = = = 
 In total , nine battlecruisers survived the Washington Naval Treaty , although HMS Tiger later became a victim of the London Naval Conference of 1930 and was scrapped . Because their high speed made them valuable surface units in spite of their weaknesses , most of these ships were significantly updated before World War II . Renown and Repulse were modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s . Between 1934 and 1936 , Repulse was partially modernized and had her bridge modified , an aircraft hangar , catapult and new gunnery equipment added and her anti @-@ aircraft armament increased . Renown underwent a more thorough reconstruction between 1937 and 1939 . Her deck armour was increased , new turbines and boilers were fitted , an aircraft hangar and catapult added and she was completely rearmed aside from the main guns which had their elevation increased to + 30 degrees . The bridge structure was also removed and a large bridge similar to that used in the King George V @-@ class battleships installed in its place . While conversions of this kind generally added weight to the vessel , Renown 's tonnage actually decreased due to a substantially lighter power plant . Similar thorough <unk> planned for Repulse and Hood were cancelled due to the advent of World War II . 
 Unable to build new ships , the Imperial Japanese Navy also chose to improve its existing battlecruisers of the Kongō class ( initially the Haruna , Kirishima , and Kongō — the Hiei only later as it had been disarmed under the terms of the Washington treaty ) in two substantial reconstructions ( one for Hiei ) . During the first of these , elevation of their main guns was increased to + 40 degrees , anti @-@ torpedo bulges and 3 @,@ 800 long tons ( 3 @,@ 900 t ) of horizontal armour added , and a " pagoda " mast with additional command positions built up . This reduced the ships ' speed to 25 @.@ 9 knots ( 48 @.@ 0 km / h ; 29 @.@ 8 mph ) . The second reconstruction focused on speed as they had been selected as fast escorts for aircraft carrier task forces . Completely new main engines , a reduced number of boilers and an increase in hull length by 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) allowed them to reach up to 30 knots once again . They were reclassified as " fast battleships , " although their armour and guns still fell short compared to surviving World War I – era battleships in the American or the British navies , with dire consequences during the Pacific War , when Hiei and Kirishima were easily crippled by US gunfire during actions off Guadalcanal , forcing their scuttling shortly afterwards . Perhaps most tellingly , Hiei was crippled by medium @-@ caliber gunfire from heavy and light cruisers in a close @-@ range night engagement . 
 There were two exceptions : Turkey 's Yavuz Sultan Selim and the Royal Navy 's Hood . The Turkish Navy made only minor improvements to the ship in the interwar period , which primarily focused on repairing wartime damage and the installation of new fire control systems and anti @-@ aircraft batteries . Hood was in constant service with the fleet and could not be withdrawn for an extended reconstruction . She received minor improvements over the course of the 1930s , including modern fire control systems , increased numbers of anti @-@ aircraft guns , and in March 1941 , radar .

 In the late 1930s navies began to build capital ships again , and during this period a number of large commerce raiders and small , fast battleships were built that are sometimes referred to as battlecruisers . Germany and Russia designed new battlecruisers during this period , though only the latter laid down two of the 35 @,@ 000 @-@ ton Kronshtadt class . They were still on the slipways when the Germans invaded in 1941 and construction was suspended . Both ships were scrapped after the war . 
 The Germans planned three battlecruisers of the O class as part of the expansion of the Kriegsmarine ( Plan Z ) . With six 15 @-@ inch guns , high speed , excellent range , but very thin armour , they were intended as commerce raiders . Only one was ordered shortly before World War II ; no work was ever done on it . No names were assigned , and they were known by their contract names : ' O ' , ' P ' , and ' Q ' . The new class was not universally welcomed in the Kriegsmarine . Their abnormally @-@ light protection gained it the derogatory nickname <unk> Panzer <unk> ( without armour nonsense ) within certain circles of the Navy . 
 = = World War II = = 
 The Royal Navy deployed some of its battlecruisers during the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940 . The Gneisenau and the Scharnhorst were engaged during the Action off Lofoten by Renown in very bad weather and disengaged after Gneisenau was damaged . One of Renown 's 15 @-@ inch shells passed through Gneisenau 's director @-@ control tower without exploding , severing electrical and communication cables as it went and destroyed the rangefinders for the forward 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) turrets . Main @-@ battery fire control had to be shifted aft due to the loss of electrical power . Another shell from Renown knocked out Gneisenau 's aft turret . The British ship was struck twice by German shells that failed to inflict any significant damage . She was the only battlecruiser to survive the war . 
 In the early years of the war various German ships had a measure of success hunting merchant ships in the Atlantic . Allied battlecruisers such as Renown , Repulse , and the fast battleships Dunkerque and Strasbourg were employed on operations to hunt down the commerce @-@ raiding German ships , but they never got close to their targets . The one stand @-@ up fight occurred when the battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen sortied into the North Atlantic to attack British shipping and were intercepted by Hood and the battleship Prince of Wales in May 1941 in the Battle of the Denmark Strait . The elderly British battlecruiser was no match for the modern German battleship : within minutes , the Bismarck 's 15 @-@ inch shells caused a magazine explosion in Hood reminiscent of the Battle of Jutland . Only three men survived . 
 The first battlecruiser to see action in the Pacific War was Repulse when she was sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers north of Singapore on 10 December 1941 whilst in company with Prince of Wales . She was lightly damaged by a single 250 @-@ kilogram ( 550 lb ) bomb and near @-@ missed by two others in the first Japanese attack . Her speed and agility enabled her to avoid the other attacks by level bombers and dodge 33 torpedoes . The last group of torpedo bombers attacked from multiple directions and Repulse was struck by five torpedoes . She quickly capsized with the loss of 27 officers and 486 crewmen ; 42 officers and 754 enlisted men were rescued by the escorting destroyers . The loss of Repulse and Prince of Wales conclusively proved the vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft without air cover of their own . 
 The Japanese Kongō @-@ class battlecruisers were extensively used as carrier escorts for most of their wartime career due to their high speed . Their World War I @-@ era armament was weaker and their upgraded armour was still thin compared to contemporary battleships . On 13 November 1942 , during the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , Hiei stumbled across American cruisers and destroyers at point @-@ blank range . The ship was badly damaged in the encounter and had to be towed by her sister ship Kirishima . Both were spotted by American aircraft the following morning and Kirishima was forced to cast off her tow because of repeated aerial attacks . Hiei 's captain ordered her crew to abandon ship after further damage and scuttled Hiei in the early evening of 14 November . On the night of 14 / 15 November during the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , Kirishima returned to Ironbottom Sound , but encountered the American battleships South Dakota and Washington . While failing to detect Washington , Kirishima engaged South Dakota with some effect . Washington opened fire a few minutes later at short range and badly damaged Kirishima , knocking out her aft turrets , jamming her rudder , and hitting the ship below the waterline . The flooding proved to be uncontrollable and Kirishima capsized three and a half hours later . 
 Returning to Japan after the Battle of Leyte Gulf , Kongō was torpedoed and sunk by the American submarine Sealion II on 21 November 1944 . Haruna was moored at Kure , Japan when the naval base was attacked by American carrier aircraft on 24 and 28 July . The ship was only lightly damaged by a single bomb hit on 24 July , but was hit a dozen more times on 28 July and sank at her pier . She was refloated after the war and scrapped in early 1946 . 
 = = = Large cruisers or " cruiser killers " = = = 
 A late renaissance in popularity of ships between battleships and cruisers in size occurred on the eve of World War II . Described by some as battlecruisers , but never classified as capital ships , they were variously described as " super cruisers " , " large cruisers " or even " unrestricted cruisers " . The Dutch , American , and Japanese navies all planned these new classes specifically to counter the heavy cruisers , or their counterparts , being built by their naval rivals . 
 The first such battlecruisers were the Dutch Design 1047 , designed to protect their colonies in the East Indies in the face of Japanese aggression . Never officially assigned names , these ships were designed with German and Italian assistance . While they broadly resembled the German Scharnhorst class and had the same main battery , they would have been more lightly armoured and only protected against eight @-@ inch gunfire . Although the design was mostly completed , work on the vessels never commenced as the Germans overran the Netherlands in May 1940 . The first ship would have been laid down in June of that year . 
 The only class of these late battlecruisers actually built were the United States Navy 's Alaska @-@ class " large cruisers " . Two of them were completed , Alaska and Guam ; a third , Hawaii , was cancelled while under construction and three others , to be named Philippines , Puerto Rico and Samoa , were cancelled before they were laid down . They were classified as " large cruisers " instead of battlecruisers , and their status as non @-@ capital ships evidenced by their being named for territories or protectorates . ( Battleships , in contrast , were named after states and cruisers after cities ) . With a main armament of nine 12 @-@ inch guns in three triple turrets and a displacement of 27 @,@ 000 long tons ( 27 @,@ 000 t ) , the Alaskas were twice the size of Baltimore @-@ class cruisers and had guns some 50 % larger in diameter . They lacked the thick armoured belt and intricate torpedo defence system of true capital ships . However , unlike most battlecruisers , they were considered a balanced design according to cruiser standards as their protection could withstand fire from their own caliber of gun , albeit only in a very narrow range band . They were designed to hunt down Japanese heavy cruisers , though by the time they entered service most Japanese cruisers had been sunk by American aircraft or submarines . Like the contemporary Iowa @-@ class fast battleships , their speed ultimately made them more useful as carrier escorts and bombardment ships than as the surface combatants they were developed to be . 
 The Japanese started designing the <unk> class , which was similar to the Alaska but with 310 @-@ millimetre ( 12 @.@ 2 in ) guns . News of the Alaskas led them to upgrade the design , creating Design B @-@ 65 . Armed with 356 mm guns , the <unk> 's would have been the best armed of the new breed of battlecruisers , but they still would have had only sufficient protection to keep out eight @-@ inch shells . Much like the Dutch , the Japanese got as far as completing the design for the <unk> , but never laid them down . By the time the designs were ready the Japanese Navy recognized that they had little use for the vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with aircraft carriers . Like the Alaskas , the Japanese did not call these ships battlecruisers , referring to them instead as super @-@ heavy cruisers . 
 = = Cold War @-@ era designs = = 
 In spite of the fact that most navies abandoned the battleship and battlecruiser concepts after World War II , Joseph Stalin 's fondness for big @-@ gun @-@ armed warships caused the Soviet Union to plan a large cruiser class in the late 1940s . In the Soviet Union they were termed " heavy cruisers " ( <unk> <unk> ) . The fruits of this program were the Project 82 ( Stalingrad ) cruisers , of 36 @,@ 500 tonnes ( 35 @,@ 900 long tons ) standard load , nine 305 mm guns and a speed of 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) . Three ships were laid down in 1951 – 52 , but they were cancelled in April 1953 after Stalin 's death . Only the central armoured hull section of the first ship , Stalingrad , was launched in 1954 and then used as a target . 
 The Soviet Kirov class is sometimes referenced as a battlecruiser . This classification arises from their over 24 @,@ 000 @-@ tonne ( 24 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ) displacement , which is roughly equal to that of a First World War battleship and more than twice the displacement of contemporary cruisers . The Kirov class lacks the armour that distinguishes battlecruisers from ordinary cruisers and they are classified as heavy nuclear @-@ powered missile cruisers ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) by Russia . Four members of the class were completed during the 1980s and 1990s , but due to budget constraints only the Petr Velikiy is operational with the Russian Navy , though plans were announced in 2010 to return the other three ships to service . As of 2012 one ship was being refitted , but the other two ships are reportedly beyond economical repair . 
 = Suicide = 
 Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one 's own death . Risk factors include mental illness such as depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , personality disorders , alcoholism , or drug abuse . Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties , troubles with relationships , or bullying . Those who have previously attempted suicide are at high risk of future attempts . Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide such as firearms and poisons , treating mental illness and drug misuse , proper media reporting of suicide , and improving economic conditions . Although crisis hotlines are common , there is little evidence for their effectiveness . 
 The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries , and is partly related to the availability of effective means . Common methods include : hanging , pesticide poisoning , and firearms . Suicide resulted in 842 @,@ 000 deaths in 2013 up from 712 @,@ 000 deaths in 1990 . This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide . Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women , with males three to four times more likely to kill themselves than females . There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non @-@ fatal attempted suicides every year . Non @-@ fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long @-@ term disabilities . In the Western world , attempts are more common in young people and are four times more common in females than in males . 
 Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion , honor , and the meaning of life . The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life . During the samurai era in Japan , a form of suicide known as seppuku was respected as a means of making up for failure or as a form of protest . Sati , a practice outlawed by the British Raj , expected the Indian widow to kill herself on her husband 's funeral fire , either willingly or under pressure from the family and society . Suicide and attempted suicide , while previously illegal , are no longer in most Western countries . It remains a criminal offense in many countries . In the 20th and 21st centuries , suicide has been used on rare occasions as a form of protest , and kamikaze and suicide bombings have been used as a military or terrorist tactic . The word is from the Latin <unk> , which means " to kill oneself " . 
 = = Definitions = = 
 Suicide , also known as completed suicide , is the " act of taking one 's own life " . Attempted suicide or non @-@ fatal suicidal behavior is self @-@ injury with the desire to end one 's life that does not result in death . Assisted suicide is when one individual helps another bring about their own death indirectly via providing either advice or the means to the end . This is in contrast to euthanasia , where another person takes a more active role in bringing about a person 's death . Suicidal ideation is thoughts of ending one 's life but not taking any active efforts to do so . 
 There is discussion about the appropriateness of the term " commit " and its use to describe suicide . Those who object to the use of commit argue that it carries with it implications that suicide is a criminal , sinful or morally wrong act . There is growing consensus that it is more appropriate to use " completed suicide , " " died by suicide " or simply " killed him / herself " to describe the act of suicide , and this is reflected in mental health organisations ' media guidance . Despite these efforts , " committed suicide " and similar descriptions remain common in both scholarly research and journalism . 
 = = Risk factors = = 
 Factors that affect the risk of suicide include psychiatric disorders , drug misuse , psychological states , cultural , family and social situations , and genetics . Mental illness and substance misuse frequently co @-@ exist . Other risk factors include having previously attempted suicide , the ready availability of a means to take one 's life , a family history of suicide , or the presence of traumatic brain injury . For example , suicide rates have been found to be greater in households with firearms than those without them . 
 Socio @-@ economic problems such as unemployment , poverty , homelessness , and discrimination may trigger suicidal thoughts . About 15 – 40 % of people leave a suicide note . Genetics appears to account for between 38 % and 55 % of suicidal behaviors . War veterans have a higher risk of suicide due in part to higher rates of mental illness such as post traumatic stress disorder and physical health problems related to war . 
 = = = Mental disorders = = = 
 Mental disorders are often present at the time of suicide with estimates ranging from 27 % to more than 90 % . Of those who have been admitted to a psychiatric unit , their lifetime risk of completed suicide is about 8 @.@ 6 % . Half of all people who die by suicide may have major depressive disorder ; having this or one of the other mood disorders such as bipolar disorder increases the risk of suicide 20 @-@ fold . Other conditions implicated include schizophrenia ( 14 % ) , personality disorders ( 8 % ) , bipolar disorder , and posttraumatic stress disorder . Others estimate that about half of people who complete suicide could be diagnosed with a personality disorder with borderline personality disorder being the most common . About 5 % of people with schizophrenia die of suicide . Eating disorders are another high risk condition . 
 A previous history of suicide attempts is the most accurate predictor of completed suicide . Approximately 20 % of suicides have had a previous attempt , and of those who have attempted suicide , 1 % complete suicide within a year and more than 5 % die by suicide within 10 years . Acts of self @-@ harm are not usually suicide attempts and most who self @-@ harm are not at high risk of suicide . Some who self @-@ harm , however , do still end their life by suicide , and risk for self @-@ harm and suicide may overlap . 
 In approximately 80 % of completed suicides , the individual has seen a physician within the year before their death , including 45 % within the prior month . Approximately 25 – 40 % of those who completed suicide had contact with mental health services in the prior year . Antidepressants of the SSRI type appear to increase the risk of suicide in children but do not change the risk in adults . 
 = = = Substance use = = = 
 Substance abuse is the second most common risk factor for suicide after major depression and bipolar disorder . Both chronic substance misuse as well as acute intoxication are associated . When combined with personal grief , such as bereavement , the risk is further increased . Substance misuse is also associated with mental health disorders . 
 Most people are under the influence of sedative @-@ hypnotic drugs ( such as alcohol or benzodiazepines ) when they die by suicide with alcoholism present in between 15 % and 61 % of cases . Countries that have higher rates of alcohol use and a greater density of bars generally also have higher rates of suicide . About 2 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 4 % of those who have been treated for alcoholism at some point in their life die by suicide . Alcoholics who attempt suicide are usually male , older , and have tried to take their own lives in the past . Between 3 and 35 % of deaths among those who use heroin are due to suicide ( approximately 14 fold greater than those who do not use ) . In adolescents who misuse alcohol , neurological and psychological dysfunctions may contribute to the increased risk of suicide . 
 The misuse of cocaine and methamphetamine has a high correlation with suicide . In those who use cocaine the risk is greatest during the withdrawal phase . Those who used <unk> are also at significant risk with around 20 % attempting suicide at some point and more than 65 % considering it . Smoking cigarettes is associated with the risk of suicide . There is little evidence as to why this association exists ; however it has been hypothesized that those who are predisposed to smoking are also predisposed to suicide , that smoking causes health problems which subsequently make people want to end their life , and that smoking affects brain chemistry causing a propensity for suicide . Cannabis however does not appear to independently increase the risk . 
 = = = Problem gambling = = = 
 Problem gambling is associated with increased suicidal ideation and attempts compared to the general population . Between 12 and 24 % pathological gamblers attempt suicide . The rate of suicide among their spouses is three times greater than that of the general population . Other factors that increase the risk in problem gamblers include mental illness , alcohol and drug misuse . 
 = = = Medical conditions = = = 
 There is an association between suicidality and physical health problems such as chronic pain , traumatic brain injury , cancer , kidney failure ( requiring hemodialysis ) , HIV , and systemic lupus erythematosus . The diagnosis of cancer approximately doubles the subsequent risk of suicide . The prevalence of increased suicidality persisted after adjusting for depressive illness and alcohol abuse . In people with more than one medical condition the risk was particularly high . In Japan , health problems are listed as the primary justification for suicide . 
 Sleep disturbances such as insomnia and sleep apnea are risk factors for depression and suicide . In some instances the sleep disturbances may be a risk factor independent of depression . A number of other medical conditions may present with symptoms similar to mood disorders , including hypothyroidism , Alzheimer 's , brain tumors , systemic lupus erythematosus , and adverse effects from a number of medications ( such as beta blockers and steroids ) . 
 = = = Psychosocial states = = = 
 A number of psychological states increase the risk of suicide including : hopelessness , loss of pleasure in life , depression and anxiousness . A poor ability to solve problems , the loss of abilities one used to have , and poor impulse control also play a role . In older adults the perception of being a burden to others is important . Suicide in which the reason is that the person feels that they are not part of society is known as egoistic suicide . Rates of suicide appear to decrease around Christmas . One study however found the risk may be greater for males on their birthday . 
 Recent life stresses such as a loss of a family member or friend , loss of a job , or social isolation ( such as living alone ) increase the risk . Those who have never married are also at greater risk . Being religious may reduce one 's risk of suicide . This has been attributed to the negative stance many religions take against suicide and to the greater connectedness religion may give . Muslims , among religious people , appear to have a lower rate of suicide ; however the data supporting this is not strong . There does not appear to be a difference in rates of attempted suicide rates . Young women in the Middle East may have higher rates . 
 Some may take their own lives to escape bullying or prejudice . A history of childhood sexual abuse and time spent in foster care are also risk factors . Sexual abuse is believed to contribute to about 20 % of the overall risk . 
 An evolutionary explanation for suicide is that it may improve inclusive fitness . This may occur if the person dying by suicide cannot have more children and takes resources away from relatives by staying alive . An objection is that deaths by healthy adolescents likely does not increase inclusive fitness . Adaptation to a very different ancestral environment may be maladaptive in the current one . 
 Poverty is associated with the risk of suicide . Increasing relative poverty compared to those around a person increases suicide risk . Over 200 @,@ 000 farmers in India have died by suicide since 1997 , partly due to issues of debt . In China suicide is three times as likely in rural regions as urban ones , partly , it is believed , due to financial difficulties in this area of the country . 
 = = = Media = = = 
 The media , which includes the Internet , plays an important role . How it depicts suicide may have a negative effect , with high volume , prominent , repetitive coverage glorifying or romanticizing suicide having the most impact . When detailed descriptions of how to kill oneself by a specific means are portrayed , this method of suicide may increase in the population as a whole . 
 This trigger of ' suicide contagion ' or copycat suicide is known as the Werther effect , named after the protagonist in Goethe 's The Sorrows of Young Werther who killed himself and then was emulated by many admirers of the book . This risk is greater in adolescents who may romanticize death . It appears that while news media has a significant effect , that of the entertainment media is equivocal . The opposite of the Werther effect is the proposed <unk> effect , in which coverage of effective coping mechanisms may have a protective effect . The term is based upon a character in Mozart 's opera The Magic Flute , who ( fearing the loss of a loved one ) had planned to kill himself until his friends helped him out . When media follows recommended reporting guidelines the risk of suicides can be decreased . Getting buy @-@ in from industry , however , can be difficult , especially in the long term . 
 = = = Rational = = = 
 Rational suicide is the reasoned taking of one 's own life , although some feel that suicide is never logical . The act of taking one 's life for the benefit of others is known as altruistic suicide . An example of this is an elder ending his or her life to leave greater amounts of food for the younger people in the community . Suicide in some Inuit cultures has been seen as an act of respect , courage , or wisdom . 
 A suicide attack is a political action where an attacker carries out violence against others which they understand will result in their own death . Some suicide bombers are motivated by a desire to obtain martyrdoms . Kamikaze missions were carried out as a duty to a higher cause or moral obligation . Murder – suicide is an act of homicide followed within a week by suicide of the person who carried out the act . 
 Mass suicides are often performed under social pressure where members give up autonomy to a leader . Mass suicides can take place with as few as two people , often referred to as a suicide pact . 
 In extenuating situations where continuing to live would be intolerable , some people use suicide as a means of escape . Some inmates in Nazi concentration camps are known to have killed themselves by deliberately touching the electrified fences . 
 = = Methods = = 
 The leading method of suicide varies among countries . The leading methods in different regions include hanging , pesticide poisoning , and firearms . These differences are believed to be in part due to availability of the different methods . A review of 56 countries found that hanging was the most common method in most of the countries , accounting for 53 % of the male suicides and 39 % of the female suicides . 
 Worldwide , 30 % of suicides are from pesticide poisoning . The use of this method , however , varies markedly from 4 % in Europe to more than 50 % in the Pacific region . It is also common in Latin America due to easy access within the farming populations . In many countries , drug overdoses account for approximately 60 % of suicides among women and 30 % among men . Many are unplanned and occur during an acute period of ambivalence . The death rate varies by method : firearms 80 @-@ 90 % , drowning 65 @-@ 80 % , hanging 60 @-@ 85 % , car exhaust 40 @-@ 60 % , jumping 35 @-@ 60 % , charcoal burning 40 @-@ 50 % , pesticides 6 @-@ 75 % , and medication overdose 1 @.@ 5 @-@ 4 % . The most common attempted methods of suicide differ from the most common successful methods ; Up to 85 % of attempts are via drug overdose in the developed world . 
 In China , the consumption of pesticides is the most common method . In Japan , self @-@ disembowelment known as seppuku ( or hara @-@ kiri ) still occurs ; however , hanging and jumping are the most common . Jumping to one 's death is common in both Hong Kong and Singapore at 50 % and 80 % respectively . In Switzerland , firearms are the most frequent suicides method in young males , however this method has decreased relatively since guns have become less common . In the United States , 57 % of suicides involve the use of firearms , with this method being somewhat more common in men than women . The next most common cause was hanging in males and self @-@ poisoning in females . Together these methods comprised about 40 % of U.S. suicides . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 There is no known unifying underlying pathophysiology for either suicide , or depression . It is however believed to result from an interplay of behavioral , socio @-@ environmental and psychiatric factors . 
 Low levels of brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) are both directly associated with suicide and indirectly associated through its role in major depression , posttraumatic stress disorder , schizophrenia and obsessive – compulsive disorder . Post @-@ mortem studies have found reduced levels of BDNF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex , in those with and without psychiatric conditions . Serotonin , a brain neurotransmitter , is believed to be low in those who die by suicide . This is partly based on evidence of increased levels of 5 @-@ HT2A receptors found after death . Other evidence includes reduced levels of a breakdown product of serotonin , 5 @-@ <unk> acid , in the cerebral spinal fluid . Direct evidence is however hard to gather . Epigenetics , the study of changes in genetic expression in response to environmental factors which do not alter the underlying DNA , is also believed to play a role in determining suicide risk . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Suicide prevention is a term used for the collective efforts to reduce the incidence of suicide through preventative measures . Reducing access to certain methods , such as firearms or toxins can reduce risk . Other measures include reducing access to charcoal and barriers on bridges and subway platforms . Treatment of drug and alcohol addiction , depression , and those who have attempted suicide in the past may also be effective . Some have proposed reducing access to alcohol as a preventative strategy ( such as reducing the number of bars ) . Although crisis hotlines are common there is little evidence to support or refute their effectiveness . In young adults who have recently thought about suicide , cognitive behavioral therapy appears to improve outcomes . Economic development through its ability to reduce poverty may be able to decrease suicide rates . Efforts to increase social connection , especially in elderly males , may be effective . The World Suicide Prevention Day is observed annually on September 10 with the support of the International Association for Suicide Prevention and the World Health Organization . 
 = = = Screening = = = 
 There is little data on the effects of screening the general population on the ultimate rate of suicide . Screening those who come to the emergency departments with injuries from self harm have been shown to help identify suicide ideation and suicide intention . <unk> tests such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Geriatric Depression Scale for older people are being used . As there is a high rate of people who test positive via these tools that are not at risk of suicide , there are concerns that screening may significantly increase mental health care resource utilization . Assessing those at high risk however is recommended . Asking about suicidality does not appear to increase the risk . 
 = = = Mental illness = = = 
 In those with mental health problems a number of treatments may reduce the risk of suicide . Those who are actively suicidal may be admitted to psychiatric care either voluntarily or involuntarily . Possessions that may be used to harm oneself are typically removed . Some clinicians get patients to sign suicide prevention contracts where they agree to not harm themselves if released . Evidence however does not support a significant effect from this practice . If a person is at low risk , outpatient mental health treatment may be arranged . Short @-@ term hospitalization has not been found to be more effective than community care for improving outcomes in those with borderline personality disorder who are chronically suicidal . 
 There is tentative evidence that psychotherapy , specifically , dialectical behaviour therapy reduces suicidality in adolescents as well as in those with borderline personality disorder . It may also be useful in decreasing suicide attempts in adults at high risk . Evidence however has not found a decrease in completed suicides . 
 There is controversy around the benefit @-@ versus @-@ harm of antidepressants . In young persons , the newer antidepressants such as SSRIs appear to increase the risk of suicidality from 25 per 1000 to 40 per 1000 . In older persons however they might decrease the risk . Lithium appears effective at lowering the risk in those with bipolar disorder and unipolar depression to nearly the same levels as the general <unk> may decrease the thoughts of suicide in some people with schizophrenia . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Approximately 0 @.@ 5 % to 1 @.@ 4 % of people die by suicide , a mortality rate of 11 @.@ 6 per 100 @,@ 000 persons per year . Suicide resulted in 842 @,@ 000 deaths in 2013 up from 712 @,@ 000 deaths in 1990 . Rates of suicide have increased by 60 % from the 1960s to 2012 , with these increases seen primarily in the developing world . Globally , as of 2008 / 2009 , suicide is the tenth leading cause of death . For every suicide that results in death there are between 10 and 40 attempted suicides . 
 Suicide rates differ significantly between countries and over time . As a percentage of deaths in 2008 it was : Africa 0 @.@ 5 % , South @-@ East Asia 1 @.@ 9 % , Americas 1 @.@ 2 % and Europe 1 @.@ 4 % . Rates per 100 @,@ 000 were : Australia 8 @.@ 6 , Canada 11 @.@ 1 , China 12 @.@ 7 , India 23 @.@ 2 , United Kingdom 7 @.@ 6 , United States 11 @.@ 4 and South Korea 28 @.@ 9 . It was ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in the United States in 2009 at about 36 @,@ 000 cases a year , with about 650 @,@ 000 people seen in emergency departments yearly due to attempting suicide . The country 's rate among men in their 50s rose by nearly half in the decade 1999 – 2010 . Lithuania , Japan and Hungary have the highest rates . The countries with the greatest absolute numbers of suicides are China and India , accounting for over half the total . In China , suicide is the 5th leading cause of death . 
 = = = Sex = = = 
 In the Western world , males die three to four times more often by means of suicide than do females , although females attempt suicide four times more often . This has been attributed to males using more lethal means to end their lives . This difference is even more pronounced in those over the age of 65 , with tenfold more males than females dying by suicide . China has one of the highest female suicide rates in the world and is the only country where it is higher than that of men ( ratio of 0 @.@ 9 ) . In the Eastern Mediterranean , suicide rates are nearly equivalent between males and females . The highest rate of female suicide is found in South Korea at 22 per 100 @,@ 000 , with high rates in South @-@ East Asia and the Western Pacific generally . 
 Due in part to social stigmatisation and the resulting depression , people whose gender identity does not align with their assigned sex are at a high risk of suicide . 
 = = = Age = = = 
 In many countries the rate of suicide is highest in the middle @-@ aged or elderly . The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due to the number of people in this age group . In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years , even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide . It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents and in young males is second only to accidental death . In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30 % of mortality . In the developing world rates are similar , but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma . In South @-@ East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world , deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females . 
 = = History = = 
 In ancient Athens , a person who committed suicide without the approval of the state was denied the honours of a normal burial . The person would be buried alone , on the outskirts of the city , without a headstone or marker . However , it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat . In Ancient Rome , while suicide was initially permitted , it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs . 
 Suicide came to be regarded as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 as the work of the Devil . In the Middle Ages , the Church had drawn @-@ out discussions as to when the desire for martyrdom was suicidal , as in the case of martyrs of Córdoba . Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings , Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century . A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe , even for the times : the dead person 's body was drawn through the streets , face down , and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap . Additionally , all of the person 's property was confiscated . 
 Attitudes towards suicide slowly began to shift during the Renaissance . John Donne 's work <unk> , contained one of the first modern defences of suicide , bringing proof from the conduct of Biblical figures , such as Jesus , Samson and Saul , and presenting arguments on grounds of reason and nature to sanction suicide in certain circumstances . 
 The secularisation of society that began during The Enlightenment questioned traditional religious attitudes toward suicide and brought a more modern perspective to the issue . David Hume denied that suicide was a crime as it affected no one and was potentially to the advantage of the individual . In his 1777 Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul he rhetorically asked , " Why should I prolong a miserable existence , because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me ? " A shift in public opinion at large can also be discerned ; The Times in 1786 initiated a spirited debate on the motion " Is suicide an act of courage ? " . 
 By the 19th @-@ century , the act of suicide had shifted from being viewed as caused by sin to being caused by insanity in Europe . Although suicide remained illegal during this period , it increasingly became the target of satirical comment , such as the Gilbert and Sullivan musical The Mikado that satirised the idea of executing someone who had already killed himself . 
 By 1879 , English law began to distinguish between suicide and homicide , although suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate . In 1882 , the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England and by the middle of the 20th century , suicide had become legal in much of the western world .

 In most Western countries , suicide is no longer a crime . It , however , was in most Western European countries from the Middle Ages until at least the 1800s . It remains a criminal offense in most Muslim @-@ majority nations . 
 In Australia suicide is not a crime . It however is a crime to counsel , incite , or aid and abet another in attempting to die by suicide , and the law explicitly allows any person to use " such force as may reasonably be necessary " to prevent another from taking their own life . The Northern Territory of Australia briefly had legal physician @-@ assisted suicide from 1996 to 1997 . 
 No country in Europe currently considers suicide or attempted suicide to be a crime . England and Wales decriminalized suicide via the Suicide Act 1961 and the Republic of Ireland in 1993 . The word " commit " was used in reference to it being illegal , however many organisations have stopped it because of the negative connotation . 
 In India , suicide used to be illegal and surviving family could face legal difficulties . The government of India decided to repeal the law in 2014 . In Germany , active euthanasia is illegal and anyone present during suicide may be prosecuted for failure to render aid in an emergency . Switzerland has recently taken steps to legalize assisted suicide for the chronically mentally ill . The high court in Lausanne , in a 2006 ruling , granted an anonymous individual with longstanding psychiatric difficulties the right to end his own life . 
 In the United States , suicide is not illegal but may be associated with penalties for those who attempt it . Physician @-@ assisted suicide is legal in the state of Washington for people with terminal diseases . In Oregon , people with terminal diseases may request medications to help end their life . 
 Canadians who have attempted suicide may be barred from entering the US . US laws allow border guards to deny access to people who have a mental illness , including those with previous suicide attempts . 
 = = = Religious views = = = 
 In most forms of Christianity , suicide is considered a sin , based mainly on the writings of influential Christian thinkers of the Middle Ages , such as St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas , but suicide was not considered a sin under the Byzantine Christian code of Justinian , for instance . In Catholic doctrine , the argument is based on the commandment " Thou shalt not kill " ( made applicable under the New Covenant by Jesus in Matthew 19 : 18 ) , as well as the idea that life is a gift given by God which should not be spurned , and that suicide is against the " natural order " and thus interferes with God 's master plan for the world . Traditionally <unk> were buried in the forest without ceremonies , like horses or cows . 
 However , it is believed that mental illness or grave fear of suffering diminishes the responsibility of the one completing suicide . Counter @-@ arguments include the following : that the sixth commandment is more accurately translated as " thou shalt not murder " ( not necessarily applying to the self ) , that God has given free will to humans , that taking one 's own life no more violates God 's Law than does curing a disease and that a number of suicides by followers of God are recorded in the Bible with no dire condemnation . 
 Judaism focuses on the importance of valuing this life , and as such , suicide is tantamount to denying God 's goodness in the world . Despite this , under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion , Jews have committed individual suicide or mass suicide ( see Masada , First French persecution of the Jews , and York Castle for examples ) and as a grim reminder there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for " when the knife is at the throat " , for those dying " to sanctify God 's Name " ( see Martyrdom ) . These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities , regarded by some as examples of heroic martyrdom , while others state that it was wrong for them to take their own lives in anticipation of martyrdom . 
 Islamic religious views are against suicide . The Qu 'ran forbids it by stating " do not kill or destroy yourself " . The hadiths also state individual suicide to be unlawful and a sin . Stigma is often associated with suicide in Islamic countries . 
 In Hinduism , suicide is generally frowned upon and is considered equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society . Hindu Scriptures state that one who dies by suicide will become part of the spirit world , wandering earth until the time one would have otherwise died , had one not taken one 's own life . However , Hinduism accepts a man 's right to end one 's life through the non @-@ violent practice of fasting to death , termed <unk> . But <unk> is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left , and no responsibilities remaining in this life . Jainism has a similar practice named <unk> . Sati , or self @-@ immolation by widows , was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages . 
 = = = Philosophy = = = 
 A number of questions are raised within the philosophy of suicide , included what constitutes suicide , whether or not suicide can be a rational choice , and the moral permissibility of suicide . Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from the position that the act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives , even if they are young and healthy . 
 Opponents to suicide include Christian philosophers such as Augustine of Hippo , Thomas Aquinas , Immanuel Kant and , arguably , John Stuart Mill – Mill 's focus on the importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions . Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice . Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will , particularly from conditions such as incurable disease , mental illness , and old age , with no possibility of improvement . They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational , arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma . A stronger stance would argue that people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering . Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel . 
 = = = Advocacy = = = 
 Advocacy of suicide has occurred in many cultures and subcultures . The Japanese military during World War II encouraged and glorified kamikaze attacks , which were suicide attacks by military aviators from the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific theatre of World War II . Japanese society as a whole has been described as " suicide tolerant " ( see Suicide in Japan ) . 
 Internet searches for information on suicide return webpages that 10 @-@ 30 % of the time encourage or facilitate suicide attempts . There is some concern that such sites may push those predisposed over the edge . Some people form suicide pacts online , either with pre @-@ existing friends or people they have recently encountered in chat rooms or message boards . The Internet , however , may also help prevent suicide by providing a social group for those who are isolated . 
 = = = Locations = = = 
 Some landmarks have become known for high levels of suicide attempts . These include San Francisco 's Golden Gate Bridge , Japan 's <unk> Forest , England 's Beachy Head and Toronto 's Bloor Street Viaduct . 
 As of 2010 , the Golden Gate Bridge has had more than 1 @,@ 300 die by suicide by jumping since its construction in 1937 . Many locations where suicide is common have constructed barriers to prevent it ; this includes the Luminous Veil in Toronto , the Eiffel Tower in Paris and Empire State Building in New York City . As of 2011 , a barrier is being constructed for the Golden Gate Bridge . They appear to be generally effective .

 An example of mass suicide is the 1978 Jonestown killings / suicide in which 909 members of the Peoples Temple , an American religious group led by Jim Jones , ended their lives by drinking grape Flavor Aid laced with cyanide .

 The 1981 hunger strikes , led by Bobby Sands , resulted in 10 deaths . The cause of death was recorded by the coroner as " starvation , self @-@ imposed " rather than suicide ; this was modified to simply " starvation " on the death certificates after protest from the dead strikers ' families .

 As suicide requires a willful attempt to die , some feel it therefore cannot be said to occur in non @-@ human animals . Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an immune system response against them . Suicidal defenses by workers are also noted in the Brazilian ant <unk> pusillus , where a small group of ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening . 
 Pea aphids , when threatened by a ladybug , can explode themselves , scattering and protecting their brethren and sometimes even killing the ladybug . Some species of termites have soldiers that explode , covering their enemies with sticky goo . 
 There have been anecdotal reports of dogs , horses and dolphins killing themselves , though with little conclusive evidence . There has been little scientific study of animal suicide . 
 = Doge ( meme ) = 
 Doge ( often pronounced / <unk> / <unk> or / <unk> / <unk> ) is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013 . The meme typically consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu accompanied by multicolored text in Comic Sans font in the foreground . The text , representing a kind of internal monologue , is deliberately written in a form of broken English . 
 The meme is based on a 2010 photograph , and became popular in late 2013 , being named as Know Your Meme 's " top meme " of that year . A cryptocurrency based on Doge , the Dogecoin , was launched in December 2013 , and the Shiba Inu is featured on Josh Wise 's NASCAR car due to a sponsorship deal . Doge has also been referenced by members of the United States Congress , a safety video for Delta Air Lines , a Google Easter egg , and the video for the song " Word Crimes " by " Weird Al " Yankovic . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Doge uses two @-@ word phrases in which the first word is almost always one of five modifiers ( " so " , " such " , " many " , " much " , and " very " ) , and the departure from correct English is to use the modifier with a word that it cannot properly modify . For example , " Much respect . So noble . " uses the doge modifiers but is not " proper " doge because the modifiers are used in a formally correct fashion ; the doge version would be " Much noble , so respect . " In addition to these phrases , a doge utterance often ends with a single word , most often " wow " but with " amaze " and " excite " also being used . 
 = = Origin and pronunciation = = 
 Kabosu ( Japanese : <unk> ) , the female Shiba Inu featured in the original meme , was a pedigree puppy who was sent to an animal shelter when her puppy mill shut down . She was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Satō , and named after the citrus fruit Kabosu because Sato thought she had a round face like the fruit . Another Shiba Inu featured in the meme is Suki , a female belonging to photographer Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco . His wife had accidentally put a scarf in the wash , making it shrink . He took a photograph of Suki wearing the scarf outside on a cold night in February 2010 . 
 Kabosu was first pictured in a 2010 blog post by Sato ; afterwards , variations of the pictures using overlaid Comic Sans text were posted from a Tumblr blog , Shiba Confessions . However , the use of the intentionally misspelled " doge " dates back to June 2005 , when it was mentioned in an episode of Homestar Runner 's puppet series . 
 The most common pronunciations of " doge " are / <unk> / <unk> and / <unk> / <unk> . In non @-@ English speaking countries , " doge " is occasionally pronounced / <unk> / <unk> . Those unfamiliar or unacquainted with the meme also use the pronunciations / <unk> / DOG @-@ ee , / <unk> / DOG @-@ ay , / <unk> / DOH @-@ gay , or simply / <unk> / DOG . 
 = = Spread = = 
 In August 2013 , images of the meme were <unk> on Reddit 's r / <unk> subreddit by 4chan 's random imageboard , / b / . Online searches for the meme began to increase in July 2013 . Google later created a Doge Easter egg : when doge meme was entered into the YouTube search bar , all the site 's text would be displayed in colorful Comic Sans , similar to the kind used by the meme . 
 The meme was ranked at No. 12 on MTV 's list of " 50 Things Pop Culture Had Us Giving Thanks For " in 2013 . Io9 compared the internal dialog of the Shiba Inu dogs to <unk> . On December 13 , Doge was named the " top meme " of 2013 by Know Your Meme . 
 In late December 2013 , members of the U.S. Congress produced material in the meme 's style . The Huffington Post commented that Doge was " killed " because of the Congress members ' usage of the meme . 
 In December 2013 , the Dogecoin was introduced as a new cryptocurrency , making it the first cryptocurrency to be based on an Internet meme ; the viral phenomenon , along with usage of the Comic Sans MS typeface , gave it " the Internet density of a large star " according to Medium writer Quinn Norton . By early 2014 , Doge 's popularity was sustained by internet communities on social media , accompanied by the rapid growth and acceptance of Dogecoin . In April 2014 , Doge experienced a second major media resurgence due to revelations of the Dogecoin community 's intent to sponsor Josh Wise in NASCAR and place a picture of the Shiba Inu on his vehicle . The car features in downloadable content for the video game NASCAR ' 14 . Media outlets have embraced the meme while reporting on the cryptocurrency and the car , with titles featuring phrases such as " so wow " and " very vroom " . 
 In mid @-@ 2014 , the advertisement agency <unk> Stockholm had Doge feature prominently in an advertising campaign for the public transport company SL in Stockholm , Sweden . The advertisement concerned the company 's special summer tickets , and featured Doge holding a public transport ticket in his mouth , with phrases such as " many summer " , " such cheap " and " very buy " . Doge was also one of 25 Internet memes featured in a Delta Air Lines safety video released in May 2015 . In the video for " Weird Al " Yankovic 's 2014 song " Word Crimes " , a song about bad grammar , a Doge tweet is used to illustrate the types of bad grammar referenced in that part of the song . 
 " Doge " was one of several additions to Dictionary.com in November 2015 . The website defines it as not just the image macro and its variants , but also the form of " language " that it utilizes . 
 The Japanese perception is remarkably different ; Satō and Kabosu are rather known as a pet and owner rather than a meme , and her blog is the fourth @-@ most popular pet @-@ related blog in the country as of December 2013 . Reacting to the meme , she explained , " To be honest , some pictures are strange for me , but it 's still funny ! I ’ m very impressed with their skills and taste . Around me , nobody knows about the doge meme . Maybe I don 't understand memes very well , because I 'm living a such an analog life . " Satō has also expressed that she had learned that " the risk of the internet is that anyone in the world can see my life on my blog " . Fleming stated that in his experience , the Shiba Inu breed has become more recognised due to the meme .
