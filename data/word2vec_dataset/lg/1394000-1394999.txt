 = Hitting for the cycle = 
 In baseball , hitting for the cycle is the accomplishment of one batter hitting a single , a double , a triple , and a home run in the same game . Collecting the hits in that order is known as a " natural cycle " . Cycles are rare in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , and have occurred only 309 times since the first by Curry Foley in 1882 . The most recent example was accomplished by Rajai Davis of the Cleveland Indians on July 2 , 2016 , against the Toronto Blue Jays . To this day , the Miami Marlins are the only MLB franchise who have never had a player perform the feat . 
 Nine days earlier , just a few weeks after his Texas Rangers teammate Shin Soo Choo hit for the cycle on July 21 , 2015 , against the Colorado Rockies , Adrián Beltré hit for the cycle on August 3 , 2015 , against the Houston Astros . With the cycle hit on August 3 , 2015 , Beltre became only the fourth ever MLB player to hit for the cycle three times , and the only baseball player to hit for the cycle three times in the same ballpark ( Globe Life Park in Arlington ) . 
 The cycle is about as uncommon as a no @-@ hitter ( 288 occurrences in MLB history ) ; it has been called " one of the rarest " and " most difficult feats " in baseball . Based on 2009 offensive levels , the probability of an average MLB player hitting for a cycle against an average team in a game is approximately 0 @.@ <unk> % ; this corresponds to about 2 @.@ 5 cycles in a 162 @-@ game season with 30 teams . 
 In other baseball leagues , the cycle is achieved less frequently . Through September 4 , 2008 , 63 players in Nippon Professional Baseball ( NPB ) , the top @-@ level baseball organization in Japan , have hit for the cycle , the most recent being <unk> Rosario . Two players have hit for the cycle on the same day once in NPB history ; this has occurred twice in MLB history . One NPB player has also hit for the cycle in an NPB All @-@ Star game . No player has ever hit for the cycle in the MLB All @-@ Star Game or the postseason .

 = = = Single = = = 
 Pursuant to Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Rule 6 @.@ 09 ( a ) , " [ the ] batter becomes a runner when he hits a fair ball " . The single is the most common type of hit in baseball : for example , there were 25 @,@ 838 singles hit during the 1988 MLB season , compared to 6 @,@ 386 doubles or 3 @,@ 180 home runs . The MLB leader in singles is Pete Rose , who is also the league 's all @-@ time hit leader . The single @-@ season leader in singles is Ichiro Suzuki , who broke Willie Keeler 's 106 @-@ year @-@ old record in 2004 by notching 225 , 19 more than the previous record . None of the top five players in singles ( Rose , Ty Cobb , Eddie Collins , Cap Anson , and Keeler ) in MLB history have hit for the cycle ; of those five , only Rose had more than 150 home runs , and two ( Collins and Keeler ) , who both played during the dead @-@ ball era , had fewer than 50 , lessening the probability of their completing the cycle . 
 = = = Double = = = 
 A double is a safe hit in which the batter reaches second base without being called out . This scenario often occurs when a ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders , or down the foul line on either side of the playing field . Tris Speaker is the all @-@ time leader in doubles in MLB history , with 792 , one of which was part of a cycle ; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9 , 1912 , against the St. Louis Browns . Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle : Stan Musial ( 725 doubles ; third all @-@ time ) completed the cycle on July 24 , 1949 ; and Craig Biggio ( 668 ; fifth all @-@ time ) accomplished the feat on April 8 , 2002 . The single @-@ season MLB leader is Earl Webb , the left @-@ handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931 . 
 = = = Triple = = = 
 The triple , in which the batter reaches third base without being put out and without the benefit of a fielding error , is often called the " hardest part of the cycle " to complete . Hitting a triple often comes under similar hit placement as a double , but may require impressive speed on the part of the runner . Because of this , it is rare to see a player with slower @-@ than @-@ average running speed complete the cycle , but it has happened , such as when catcher Bengie Molina hit for the cycle on July 16 , 2010 ; Molina described himself as " the [ slowest ] guy in baseball " earlier that season . The MLB all @-@ time leader in triples is Sam Crawford , who completed the three @-@ base hit 309 times in his career ; however , none of those triples was ever part of a cycle . Of the top five players in MLB history in triples , two – Honus Wagner and Roger Connor — have hit for the cycle : Connor in 1890 and Wagner in 1912 . The MLB single @-@ season record holder for triples , Chief Wilson , hit for the cycle in 1910 , two years before his record @-@ setting season in which he hit 36 triples . 
 = = = Home run = = = 
 A home run is a hit in which the player reaches home plate , and scores a run on the same play without being called out . Most often in modern baseball , this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory . However , it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play ; this is called an inside @-@ the @-@ park home run . Home @-@ run hitters are often likely to be larger , slower players due to their strength , and may not be fast enough to complete the triple . The MLB single @-@ season and all @-@ time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds , who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22 @-@ season career . Bonds never hit for the cycle . The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez ( fourth all @-@ time ; 695 home runs as of June 25 , 2016 ) , who hit for the cycle on June 5 , 1997 .

 The most cycles hit by a single player in Major League Baseball is three , accomplished by four players : 
 John Reilly was the first to hit a third when he completed the cycle on August 6 , 1890 , after hitting his first two in a week ( September 12 and 19 , 1883 ) for the Cincinnati Reds . 
 Bob Meusel became the second man to complete three cycles , playing for the New York Yankees ; his first occurred on May 7 , 1921 , the next on July 3 , 1922 , and his final cycle on July 26 , 1928 . 
 The third , Babe Herman ( not to be confused with the famous George Herman " Babe " Ruth ) , was the first three @-@ cycle player to accomplish the feat for two different teams — the Brooklyn Robins ( May 18 and July 24 , 1931 ) and the Chicago Cubs ( September 30 , 1933 ) . 
 Adrián Beltré became the fourth player to hit for the cycle three times in his career and the second three @-@ cycle player to hit for the cycle with two different teams ( one with the Seattle Mariners and two with the Texas Rangers ) . Even though Beltre hit his cycles with two different teams , all the cycles occurred in the same ballpark , Globe Life Park . Beltre 's third cycle on August 3 , 2015 only took 5 innings , it was the fastest cycle since 1974 at the time . 
 Reilly ( 1884 ) , Tip O 'Neill ( 1887 ) , Herman ( 1931 ) , and Aaron Hill ( 2012 ) are the only players in MLB history who have hit for the cycle twice in one season . 
 The most cycles hit in a single major league season is eight . Cycles have occurred on the same day twice in Major League Baseball history : on September 17 , 1920 , hit by Bobby Veach of the Detroit Tigers and George Burns of the New York Giants ; and again on September 1 , 2008 , when the Arizona Diamondbacks ' Stephen Drew and the Seattle Mariners ' Adrián Beltré each completed the four @-@ hit group . Conversely , the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle was 5 years , 1 month , and 10 days , a drought lasting from Bill Joyce 's cycle in 1896 to Harry Davis ' in 1901 . 
 = = = = Natural cycles in MLB = = = = 
 The natural cycle , in which the hits come in order from least total bases to most ( single , double , triple , and home run ) , has been accomplished 14 times in MLB history . Bill Collins was the first to collect the hits in order on October 6 , 1910 . The natural cycle happened most commonly in the 1960s , occurring three times in a four @-@ year span ( Jim Hickman in 1963 , Ken Boyer in 1964 , and Billy Williams in 1966 ) . It also occurred three times in a seven @-@ season timeframe from 2000 to 2006 : José Valentín in 2000 ; Brad Wilkerson in 2003 ; and Gary Matthews , Jr. in 2006 . The natural cycle has also been accomplished in reverse ( home run , triple , double , single ) by six players : Bid McPhee ( 1887 ) ; Gee Walker ( 1937 ) ; Jim Fregosi ( 1968 ; his second cycle ) ; Luke Scott ( 2006 ) ; Carlos Gómez ( 2008 ) ; and Rajai Davis ( 2016 ) .

 Eight players have hit a grand slam as the home run of their cycle ; in the 21st century , that list has included Miguel Tejada , Jason Kubel , and Bengie Molina . Five players have hit a walk @-@ off home run to win the game as the final hit of their cycles : Boyer , César Tovar , George Brett , Dwight Evans , and Carlos González . In 2009 , Ian Kinsler had six hits in the game when he hit his cycle ; the accomplishment came on Jackie Robinson Day , honoring the African @-@ American pioneer who had himself hit for the cycle on August 29 , 1948 . 
 Four batters hit for the cycle in the same season in which they won the Triple Crown : Nap Lajoie ( American League ) in 1901 ; Jimmie Foxx ( American League ) and Chuck Klein ( National League ) in 1933 ; and Lou Gehrig ( American League ) in 1934 . Gehrig is the only player to complete the MLB Triple Crown in his cycle @-@ hitting season , leading both the National and American Leagues in batting average , home runs , and runs batted in . When Foxx and Klein won in the same season , each was playing for a team in Philadelphia : Klein for the Phillies and Foxx for the Athletics . Three players – John Olerud , Michael Cuddyer , and Bob Watson — have hit for the cycle in both the National and American Leagues . Family pairs to hit for the cycle include father and son Gary and Daryle Ward , who accomplished the feat in 1980 and 2004 , respectively ; and grandfather and grandson Gus and David Bell , the elder of whom hit for the cycle in 1951 , and the younger in 2004 . Harry Danning , on June 15 , 1940 , became the last player so far to hit for the cycle with his home run coming on an inside @-@ the @-@ park home run . 
 Two players – Joe Cronin and Adrián Beltré – have hit for the cycle as a member of a club and as a member of that club 's opponent ( Cronin with the Washington Senators against the Boston Red Sox and later with the Red Sox ; Beltre with the Seattle Mariners against the Texas Rangers and later with the Rangers ) . Beltre hit another as a Texas Ranger on August 3 , 2015 having done so by the 5th inning . All three of Beltre 's cycles came at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington , the only player to have three cycles at the same ballpark with two different teams .

 During his eight seasons playing for the Yokohama <unk> , Bobby Rose hit for three cycles , the most of any Nippon Professional Baseball player . Each spaced two seasons apart , his first cycle occurred on May 2 , 1995 , the next on April 29 , 1997 , and his final cycle on June 30 , 1999 . Other than Rose , only two NPB players have hit multiple cycles : Fumio Fujimura with the Osaka Tigers and Hiromi Matsunaga with the Hankyu / Orix Braves , both with two . Fujimura is also the only player to have hit a cycle during both the single league era and the current dual league era . 
 The 2003 NPB season saw the most cycles hit in a single season — five . That season also saw the only instance of cycles occurring on the same day : on July 1 , hit by <unk> Inaba of the Yakult Swallows and <unk> Muramatsu of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks . The next day , Shinjiro Hiyama became the third player to hit for the cycle in two days . Conversely , the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle was 3 years , 5 months , and 9 days , a drought lasting from Alex Ochoa 's cycle in 2004 to Julio Zuleta 's in 2007 . 
 = = = = Natural cycles in NPB = = = = 
 The natural cycle has been accomplished five times in NPB history . Fumio Fujimura 's second cycle on May 25 , 1950 , was the first time a player collected the hits in order . On average , the natural cycle occurs approximately every 13 years . Other than Fujimura , the four players to hit for the natural cycle are Kazuhiko Kondo in 1961 , Takahiro <unk> in 1976 , <unk> Okamura in 1985 , and Muramatsu in 2003 . The natural cycle has only been accomplished in reverse by Ochoa ( 2004 ) .

 When Ochoa hit his cycle with the Chunichi Dragons on April 13 , 2004 , he became the only player to hit a cycle in both Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball . Eight years earlier , Ochoa had accomplished the same feat on July 3 , 1996 , while playing for MLB 's New York Mets . Yakult Swallows catcher <unk> <unk> is the only player to hit for the cycle in an NPB All @-@ Star game , doing so in game 2 of the 1992 series . Inaba is the only player to hit for the cycle in a rain @-@ shortened game . After hitting a triple in the first inning and hitting a home run in the fourth , Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven @-@ run fifth inning when the order batted around . Kosuke Fukudome is the only player to have hit a grand slam as the home run of the cycle . Hiroshi <unk> and Kazuhiko Kondo are the only two players have hit a walk @-@ off home run to win the game as the final hit of their cycles . 
 = William L. Brandon = 
 William Lindsay Brandon ( born c . 1801 – 1802 in Adams County , Mississippi ; died October 8 , 1890 in Wilkinson County , Mississippi ) was a physician , state legislator , planter and military officer best known for having served as a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War . Brandon was born c . 1801 – 1802 , though his exact birthdate is indeterminate . 
 Brandon served with the Confederate States Army from 1861 until 1864 . He fought in several major battles , such as the Battle of Malvern Hill , where he was greatly injured after a ball passed though his ankle . He also participated in the Yorktown siege of 1862 , the Battle of Williamsburg and the campaigns of Chattanooga and Knoxville . Brandon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in June 1864 . From July 1864 until the end of the war , he served in such positions as the commander of the Reserve Corps of Mississippi and the head of the Confederate Bureau of Conscription . 
 In his postbellum life , he returned to his Wilkinson County plantation where he worked , despite physical injury and age , until his death on October 8 , 1890 . Upon his death , he was buried at his plantation . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 William Lindsay Brandon was born to Irishman Gerard Brandon , a veteran of the American Revolution , in either 1801 or 1802 in Adams County , Mississippi . Brandon 's exact birth date cannot be determined as his family records were destroyed in an 1831 fire . He settled in Wilkinson County , Mississippi near <unk> in 1824 . The following year , Brandon married Ann Davis . This union produced two children , however , both Davis and her children would soon die . Brandon was educated at Washington College ( now Washington and Lee University ) in Virginia , and the College of New Jersey ( now Princeton University ) where he studied medicine . In his antebellum career , he became a planter , highly interested in horses and hunting . In 1826 , Brandon served in the Mississippi State Legislature , around the same time that his brother Gerard Brandon was serving as the governor of Mississippi . In 1828 , Brandon founded the <unk> Club , a gentlemen 's club populated by propertied men from the Natchez area of Mississippi and from West Feliciana Parish in Louisiana . In 1833 , Brandon married Ann Eliza Ratliff , having three sons , William , Lane William and Robert , all of whom later served in the Confederate States Army . A fourth son , Eugene , died at the age of two . Brandon enlisted for service in the Mexican American War , and become a major general in the local militia . Because of his medicinal expertise , Brandon was consulted often by professionals in the field . When Brandon 's wife died in 1840 , he continued to take care of her plantation , as well as his own Arcole Plantation . By 1860 , Brandon owned a considerable amount of property , including $ 14 @,@ 000 in real estate and $ 64 @,@ 000 in personal property , as well as 63 slaves and 16 slave quarters . 
 = = Military career = = 
 Despite his age of 59 or 60 at the time , Brandon was permitted to serve with the Confederate States Army in 1861 as lieutenant colonel of the 21st Mississippi Infantry Regiment and went to Virginia . In July 1861 , Brandon contracted a cold , prompting him to take a leave from active service until the end of August . His subordinates did not believe him fit for duty again and he did not receive an appointment to colonel . Brandon and his regiment were placed in the Confederate Army of the Potomac in Virginia . During the summer and fall of 1861 , Brandon 's unit was on duty in the northeastern part of the state . During the Yorktown siege , his regiment , along with other Confederate army units , were spread out across eastern Virginia between Culpeper , Fredricksburg , and Norfolk , forming the Warwick Line . Brandon 's regiment would again see action in the Battle of Williamsburg , fought the day after the action at Yorktown . 
 During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862 , Brandon 's ankle joint was struck by a ball . As he fell , his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode . Oblivious to his wounds , Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and remained on the field until men were able to pick him up and carry him to the rear . Because there was no visible bleeding , Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse @-@ back to a hospital . Initially , Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain , but he refused to drink it without water and sugar . He drank it only after being convinced it was necessary . Brandon 's foot was removed after a <unk> was put in place . Brandon 's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to be a very painful procedure , as there was not enough <unk> to produce a full anesthesia . To replace his amputated leg , his doctors gave him a wooden prosthetic leg . Because of Brandon 's age , his doctors thought his chances of survival were slight . After coming to Richmond , he was tended to by friends and his servant . Confederate President Jefferson Davis even offered Brandon the hospitality of his mansion in the city . 
 Brandon later returned to active service , commanding his regiment through the Battle of Gettysburg . General William Barksdale was killed in the battle ; Colonel Humphreys became brigadier general to replace him , and Brandon was in turn promoted to colonel . He went on to see action in the Chickamauga Campaign . In September 1863 , after the Battle of Chickamauga , Brandon resigned from active duty . Because of his artificial leg , age and the recurrence of an ailment from 1862 , he did not feel fit for military service at the time . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In June 1864 , Brandon was promoted to brigadier general and sent to Mississippi where , on 23 July , he was given command of the Reserve Corps of Mississippi . He was later placed in charge of the Confederate Bureau of Conscription on 8 October 1864 , where he worked to recruit men for the Confederate army . After the war , Brandon returned to his Arcole Plantation in Wilkinson County , where despite his age and physical disability , he worked until his death on October 8 , 1890 . Brandon was buried at his plantation . 
 Brandon 's son Lane William Brandon eventually graduated from Harvard University . In service to the Confederate States Army , Lane achieved the rank of captain . He fought in several major battles including Chickamauga and Malvern Hill , where both he and his father were wounded . William R. Brandon , a physician , was wounded in the Battle of Gettysburg . Robert L. Brandon went on to attend Yale University . 
 = Sulu bleeding @-@ heart = 
 The Sulu bleeding @-@ heart ( Gallicolumba menagei ) is a species of bird in the pigeon and dove family , Columbidae . It is endemic to the island of Tawi @-@ Tawi and its surrounding islets in the Philippines ' Sulu Archipelago . This species is known only from two specimens collected in 1891 , and has not been recorded with certainty since . It lives in primary and secondary forests that have a closed canopy . The Sulu bleeding @-@ heart is a medium @-@ sized pigeon with a short tail . Bright metallic green feathers stretch from the forehead and crown down to the mantle and sides of the breast , where they surround a large , pale orange breast spot with diffuse edges that gives the species the name " bleeding @-@ heart " . The lower wings and back are varying shades of brown , and the throat and chest are largely white . The belly is an ashy @-@ gray . 
 Like other bleeding @-@ hearts , the Sulu bleeding @-@ heart is primarily a sedentary bird , feeding on the forest floor and flying only for short distances . Little is known about its behavior due to the paucity of sightings . Searches of Tawi @-@ Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover any evidence of the species ' continued existence . Most of the bird 's habitat was logged on Tawi @-@ Tawi by 1994 . However , an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding @-@ heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi @-@ Tawi . While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species , there is some hope that it may still persist . For this reason , it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN . Any surviving population would be very small , likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals , and would be threatened by habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Sulu bleeding @-@ heart was originally described in 1894 as <unk> menagei by Frank Swift Bourns and Dean Conant Worcester . The holotype , a male , was collected by them from the small island of <unk> off the coast of Tawi @-@ Tawi in October 1891 . The specific name , menagei , honors Louis F. Menage , a Minnesota real estate tycoon who funded the expedition . It is a member of the bleeding @-@ heart superspecies , which includes Luzon bleeding @-@ heart , Mindanao bleeding @-@ heart , Mindoro bleeding @-@ heart , and Negros bleeding @-@ heart ; these birds are so similar that some authors have considered them to be a single species . Some authors place the Sulu bleeding @-@ heart , the other bleeding @-@ hearts , and the cinnamon ground dove in their own subgenus , Gallicolumba . The Sulu bleeding @-@ heart has no known subspecies . It is also called the Tawitawi bleeding @-@ heart and the Tawitawi <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Sulu bleeding @-@ heart is a medium @-@ sized pigeon with a short tail . Bright metallic green feathers stretch from the forehead and crown down to the mantle and sides of the breast . The scapular feathers are a dark chestnut color and are fringed with iridescence that can appear violet , green , or lilac in different lights . The wing @-@ coverts are also a dark brown , with some of the feathers being ashy @-@ gray at the tip to form a slight wingbar . The primary and greater coverts as well as the secondaries are a fulvous @-@ brown edged in rufous , while the primaries are a dark brown with the longest feathers being tipped in black . The bleeding @-@ heart 's underwings are chestnut . The back down to the upper portion of the tail is a ruddy @-@ brown narrowly fringed with metallic green or violet . The center of the tail is dark brown while the edges are ashy @-@ gray and tipped with a broad black band ; the undertail @-@ coverts are orange while the undertail is ashy @-@ gray . The area around the bird 's eyes is black with a faint hint of glossy green , and the chin , throat , and breast are pure white . The upper breast is framed by large patches of metallic green feathers of the same coloration as the mantle that form an incomplete breast band in the center of the chest . In between these patches is a large , pale orange breast spot with diffuse edges . The belly is ashy @-@ gray . Males and females are similar in appearance , and the plumage of the juvenile is unknown . The iris is a light silver @-@ gray . The bill is black with a gray tip , and the feet are red . The bleeding @-@ heart is between 25 and 27 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 and 10 @.@ 6 in ) long , and the weight is unknown . 
 The Sulu bleeding @-@ heart is easily distinguished from most terrestrial doves found on Tawi @-@ Tawi . The emerald dove is most likely to be confused with the bleeding @-@ heart , but the emerald dove is distinguished by a larger and whiter shoulder patch , a white supercilium , and dark chestnut underparts . Two bleeding @-@ hearts are kept as pets and may escape on Tawi @-@ Tawi ; the Sulu bleeding @-@ heart differs from the Luzon bleeding @-@ heart by not having the Luzon bleeding @-@ heart 's purple nape and back , and from the Mindanao bleeding @-@ heart by lacking prominent gray wing @-@ bars and an orange belly .

 The Sulu bleeding @-@ heart is endemic to the island of Tawi @-@ Tawi and its nearby islets in the southwestern part of the Philippines 's Sulu Archipelago . The bleeding @-@ heart is believed to be extirpated on the Tawi @-@ Tawi mainland , but there are indigenous reports of the species on the nearby islets of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . There is also an unconfirmed nineteenth @-@ century sight record of the species from the island of Jolo in the center of the Sulu Archipelago . 
 The species lives in primary and secondary forests that have a closed canopy . On the smaller islets , it lives in beach forest .

It is very elusive in its forested habitat , and nothing else is known about its behavior . 
 = = Status = = 
 The Sulu bleeding @-@ heart is considered to be critically endangered by the IUCN . The Sulu bleeding @-@ heart has always been considered a rare bird , and only two specimens , both males , have ever been taken of the species . The specimens , collected in October 1891 on the small islet of <unk> , are the last time anyone has definitely seen the Sulu bleeding @-@ heart alive . The bleeding @-@ heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success . Most of Tawi @-@ Tawi 's forests were cleared by August 1994 , and the Sulu bleeding @-@ heart may well be extirpated on the mainland . However , an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding @-@ heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s . Despite this , an expedition in 2009 failed to find any signs of the species or discover a new report of the species ' continued existence . The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a viable population . Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding @-@ hearts is likely to be small , possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds , and would be threatened by continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting . As the Mindanao and Luzon bleeding @-@ hearts are popular cagebirds , any bleeding @-@ heart found on Tawi @-@ Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding @-@ heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding @-@ heart . There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago , and other than two environmental education initiatives in the 1990s nothing has been done to protect any surviving population . 
 = Battle of Barnet = 
 The Battle of Barnet was a decisive engagement in the Wars of the Roses , a dynastic conflict of 15th @-@ century England . The military action , along with the subsequent Battle of Tewkesbury , secured the throne for Edward IV . On 14 April 1471 near Barnet , then a small Hertfordshire town north of London , Edward led the House of York in a fight against the House of Lancaster , which backed Henry VI for the throne . Leading the Lancastrian army was Richard Neville , 16th Earl of Warwick , who played a crucial role in the fate of each king . Historians regard the battle as one of the most important clashes in the Wars of the Roses , since it brought about a decisive turn in the fortunes of the two houses . Edward 's victory was followed by fourteen years of Yorkist rule over England . 
 Formerly a key figure in the Yorkist cause , Warwick defected to the Lancastrians over disagreements about Edward 's nepotism , secret marriage , and foreign policy . Leading a Lancastrian army , the earl defeated his former allies , forcing Edward to flee to Burgundy . The Yorkist king persuaded his host , Charles the Bold , to help him regain the English throne . Leading an army raised with Burgundian money , Edward launched his invasion of England , which culminated at the fields north of Barnet . Under cover of darkness , the Yorkists moved close to the Lancastrians , and clashed in a thick fog at dawn . As both armies fought , the Earl of Oxford on the Lancastrian right routed the Yorkists opposite under Lord Hastings , chasing them back to Barnet . On their return to the battlefield , Oxford 's men were erroneously shot at by the Lancastrian centre commanded by Lord Montague . As cries of treason ( always a possibility in that chaotic period ) spread through their line , Lancastrian morale was disrupted and many abandoned the fight . While retreating , Warwick was killed by Yorkist soldiers . 
 Warwick had been such an influential figure in 15th @-@ century English politics that , on his death , no one matched him in terms of power and popularity . Deprived of Warwick 's support , the Lancastrians suffered their final defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471 , which marked the downfall of the House of Lancaster and the ascendancy of the House of York . Three centuries after the Battle of Barnet , a stone obelisk was raised on the spot where Warwick purportedly died . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Wars of the Roses were a series of conflicts between various English lords and nobles in support of two different royal families . In 1461 , the conflict reached a milestone when the House of York supplanted its rival , the House of Lancaster , as the ruling royal house in England . Edward IV , leader of the Yorkists , seized the throne from the Lancastrian king , Henry VI , who was captured in 1465 and imprisoned in the Tower of London . The Lancastrian queen , Margaret of Anjou , and her son , Edward of Lancaster , fled to Scotland and organised resistance . Edward IV crushed the uprisings , and pressured the Scottish government to force Margaret out ; the House of Lancaster went into exile in France . As the Yorkists tightened their hold over England , Edward rewarded his supporters , including his chief adviser , Richard Neville , 16th Earl of Warwick , elevating them to higher titles and awarding them land confiscated from their defeated foes . The Earl grew to disapprove of the King 's rule , however , and their relationship later became strained . 
 Warwick had planned for Edward to marry a French princess — Bona of Savoy — to create an alliance between the two countries . The young king , however , favoured ties with Burgundy , and , in 1464 , further angered the Earl by secretly marrying Elizabeth Woodville ; as an impoverished Lancastrian widow , she was regarded by the Yorkists as an unsuitable queen . At her request , Edward bestowed gifts of land and titles on her relations and arranged marriages to rich and powerful families . Eligible bachelors were paired with the Woodville females , narrowing the marriage prospects for Warwick 's daughters . Furthermore , the Earl was offended by two matches involving his kin . The first was the marriage of his aunt , Lady Katherine Neville , over 60 years old , to Elizabeth 's 20 @-@ year @-@ old brother , John Woodville , a pairing considered outside of normal wedlock by many people . The other was his nephew 's fiancée , the daughter of Henry Holland , 3rd Duke of Exeter , who was taken as a bride by the Queen 's son , Thomas Grey , with Edward 's approval . Exasperated by these acts , Warwick decided the Woodvilles were a malignant influence on his liege . He felt marginalized : his influence over the young king was failing , and he decided to take drastic action to force Edward 's compliance . Warwick 's alternative plan was to replace the King with his fellow conspirator , the Duke of Clarence , Edward 's younger brother . 
 <unk> several rebellions in the north , Warwick lured the King away from his main bastion of support in the south . Edward found himself outnumbered ; while retreating , he learned that Warwick and Clarence had called for open support of the rebellion . After winning the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469 , the Earl found the Yorkist king deserted by his followers , and brought him to Warwick Castle for " protection " . Lancastrian supporters took advantage of Edward 's imprisonment to stage uprisings . Because most Yorkist @-@ aligned warlords refused to rally to Warwick 's call , the Earl was pressured to release the King . Back in power , Edward did not openly pursue Warwick 's transgressions against him , but the Earl suspected that the King held a grudge . Warwick engineered another rebellion , this time to replace Edward with Clarence . The two conspirators , however , had to flee to France when Edward crushed the uprising — the Battle of <unk> Field — on 12 March 1470 . Through letters in the rebels ' possession and confessions from the leaders , the King uncovered the Earl 's betrayal . In a deal brokered by the French king , Louis XI , the Earl agreed to serve Margaret and the Lancastrian cause . Warwick invaded England at the head of a Lancastrian army and , in October 1470 , forced Edward to seek refuge in Burgundy , then ruled by the King 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Charles the Bold . The throne of England was temporarily restored to Henry VI ; on 14 March 1471 , Edward brought an army back across the English Channel , precipitating the Battle of Barnet a month later .

 Edward IV was normally at the forefront of his armies . Standing 6 ft 3 in ( 1 @.@ 91 m ) , he was an inspiring figure in combat , attacking foes while wearing a suit of gilded armour . Medieval texts describe the King as handsome , finely muscled and with a broad chest . He was personable and charismatic , easily winning people to his cause . Edward was a capable tactician and leader in battles . He frequently spotted and exploited defensive frailties in enemy lines , often with decisive results . By 1471 , the young king was a highly respected field commander . He received some criticism , however ; after winning the throne in 1461 , he proved indecisive about putting down rebellions . Historian Charles Ross praises Edward 's leadership and skill in close combat rather than his strategies and tactics . With his good looks and capable leadership , Edward was popular among the common people , especially compared to Henry VI . His trade policies , which aimed to expand and protect markets for English commerce , pleased local merchants , who were also won over by the Yorkist king 's personality . By 1469 , Edward 's groundswell of popular support had eroded away . The euphoria of a change in government had ebbed and the people blamed Edward for failing to " bring the realm of England in [ to ] great popularity and rest " and allowing Yorkist nobles to go unpunished for abuses . When Edward invaded England in 1471 , not many common people openly celebrated his return . 
 Edward was joined at Barnet by his brothers , Richard , Duke of Gloucester , and George , Duke of Clarence . Unlike his eldest brother , Gloucester was slender and seemingly delicate . He was 18 years old at the Battle of Barnet , his first major engagement . His military prowess , however , was well respected ; many historians judge him a capable warrior and military leader . Clarence was not as well regarded as his brothers , especially in matters of loyalty . When Edward became king , Clarence was chosen as his heir ; however , the births of Elizabeth of York ( 1466 ) and Edward V ( 1470 ) displaced the Duke in the line of succession to the throne . Hence , Clarence participated in Warwick 's schemes , marrying the Earl 's daughter Isabella , believing he could gain his brother 's throne . Clarence lost faith in the Earl when Warwick defected to the Lancastrians and married off his other daughter , Anne , to their prince in order to cement his new allegiance . When Edward launched his campaign to retake England , Clarence accepted his brother 's offer of pardon and rejoined the Yorkists at Coventry on 2 April 1471 . The last of the Yorkist commanders was William , Lord Hastings , a loyal subject since the start of the wars . Hastings had accompanied the young king in exile and supported his return . The courtier was rewarded for his faithfulness , gaining the lieutenancy of Calais in 1471 , and becoming Edward 's lord chamberlain and primary confidant . 
 = = = Lancastrian = = = 
 Warwick had fought for the House of York since the early stages of the Wars of the Roses and alongside his cousin , Edward IV , in many of the battles . His years of loyalty earned him the trust of the Yorkists , and his victories — both political and military — and popularity with the common people made him an important figure . He had powerful influence over the line of succession , earning him the nickname " the Kingmaker " . Early historians described him as a military genius , but by the 20th century his tactical acumen was reconsidered ; Philip Haigh suspects that the Earl largely owed some of his victories , such as the First Battle of St Albans , to being in the right place at the right time . Christopher Gravett believes the Earl was too defensive and lacked mental flexibility . 
 John Neville , 1st Marquess of Montagu , was less ambitious than his brother Warwick , but a more capable warrior and tactician . In 1464 , he commanded a Yorkist force that turned the tables on a Lancastrian ambush at the Battle of <unk> Moor , and launched a surprise attack at the Battle of Hexham . These victories capped Neville 's extensive service in the north , and Edward rewarded him with the Earldom of Northumberland , which bore substantial income . The gift was particularly gratifying for Neville ; his family had experienced a deep feud with the former earls of Northumberland , the Percys , who supported the House of Lancaster . However , in March 1470 , Edward , trying to win over the Percys ' support , reinstated Henry Percy to the earldom . As recompense , Neville received the grander title of Marquess of Montagu ; however , the lands accompanying this rank were much poorer than the estate he had lost . The new marquess saw it as an insult — an insubstantial title that was inadequate recognition for his years of faithful service . Montagu did not immediately join Warwick 's rebellion , however ; he defected later in the year when his brother invaded England . 
 Not much is known about the early history of John de Vere , 13th Earl of Oxford , another Lancastrian commander ; the chronicles mention little about him until the Battle of <unk> Field . His father , the previous earl and a loyal Lancastrian , was executed for a failed plot to assassinate Edward IV . The Yorkist king tried to secure the loyalty of Oxford by knighting him and pardoning his transgressions . This tactic failed ; Oxford remained true to the Lancastrian crown and participated in Warwick 's effort to dethrone Edward . Historians describe the young Oxford as a decent military leader , exemplified by his conduct in the Battle of Barnet . 
 Although Henry Holland , 3rd Duke of Exeter , was of royal blood , he was commonly viewed as a criminal , prone to violence and stupidity . A proven enemy of the Nevilles , Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457 . Nonetheless , when Warwick joined the Lancastrians , Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England . Although he supported the Lancastrian cause , Exeter had family ties to the House of York ; he was husband to Anne of York , Edward 's sister . 
 Edmund Beaufort , 4th Duke of Somerset , was a prominent Lancastrian and one of Margaret 's trusted men . Interactions between Somerset and Warwick were less than cordial ; the Nevilles and Beauforts had been feuding over estates since the early 1450s . Adding to their animosity was the death of Somerset 's father , the 2nd Duke , at the First Battle of St Albans . The Yorkists won the engagement , after Warwick slipped his force past the Lancastrian defence and attacked from behind . The Beauforts largely blamed the Earl for the Duke 's death . Somerset is listed in early chronicles as a participant in the Battle of Barnet ; however , this has been disputed . When the Lancastrians retook England , Warwick ordered the duke to watch over Henry VI in London . Several historians , such as Ross and Anthony Goodman , agree that Somerset left London to welcome Margaret in the south . Michael Jones points out that the Duke is recorded as having been in Salisbury on the day of the battle , trying to recruit townsmen for the Lancastrian cause . Trevor Royle suggests that due to Somerset 's distrust of Warwick , the Duke would rather await his queen and her army than voluntarily aid the Earl . Therefore , it is unlikely that he fought at Barnet . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 On 14 March 1471 , Edward 's army landed at Ravenspurn . Gathering more men as they went , the Yorkists moved inland towards York . Edward 's march was unopposed at the beginning because he was moving through lands that belonged to the Percys , and the Earl of Northumberland was indebted to the Yorkist king for the return of his northern territory . Furthermore , Edward announced that he was returning only to claim his father 's title of Duke of York and not to contest the English crown . The ruse was successful : Montagu , who was monitoring Edward 's march , could not convince his men to move against the Yorkist king . 
 Once Edward 's force had gathered sufficient strength , he dropped the ruse and headed south towards London . Fighting off Exeter 's and Oxford 's attacks , he besieged Warwick at Coventry , hoping to engage the earl in battle . Although Warwick 's force had more men than Edward 's army , the earl refused the challenge . He was waiting for the arrival of Clarence , who wanted to use their combined strength to overwhelm the Yorkists . When he learned of this , Edward sent Gloucester to entreat Clarence to return to the House of York , an offer that Clarence readily accepted . Reconciled , the royal brothers moved towards Coventry , and Clarence urged Warwick 's surrender . Infuriated with his son @-@ in @-@ law 's treachery , Warwick refused to speak to Clarence . Unable to fight the earl at this time , Edward turned again towards London . 
 Reinforced by Montagu , Oxford , and Exeter a few days later , Warwick followed the Yorkists ' trail . He hoped that London , under Somerset 's control , would close its gates to Edward , allowing him to catch the Yorkist army in the open . The city , however , welcomed Edward warmly ; Somerset had left the city , and the London populace preferred the young Yorkist king to Henry VI . The old king greeted his usurper warmly and offered himself into custody , trusting " [ his ] life to be in no danger in [ Edward 's ] hands . " Lancastrian scouts probed Barnet , which lay 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) north of London , but were beaten off . On 13 April their main army took up positions on a ridge of high ground north of Barnet to prepare for battle the next day . Warwick arrayed his army in a line from east to west , on either side of the Great North Road running through Barnet . Oxford held the right flank and Exeter the left . Montagu commanded the centre , and Warwick readied himself to command from among the reserves . The earl displaced his entire line slightly to the west ; a depression at the rear of his left flank could impede Exeter 's group if they had to fall back . 
 Warwick 's army heavily outnumbered Edward 's , although sources differ on exact numbers . Lancastrian strength ranges from 10 @,@ 000 to 30 @,@ 000 men , with 7 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 on the Yorkist side . Facing this disadvantage , Edward hurried to meet the Lancastrians with a surprise attack . He brought Henry VI along to prevent the Lancastrians from retaking their king . Edward reached Barnet in the evening , and without knowing the precise location of his foes , prepared the battle line . The Yorkist king deployed Hastings on the left and entrusted Gloucester to lead the right flank . Clarence would fight alongside Edward in the centre , although this was not due to faith in his ability — it was easier for the Yorkists to keep an eye on their twice @-@ defected prince there . A contingent of reserves was kept at the rear , ready to deploy at Edward 's call . As night fell , Edward put his plan for surprise morning attack in motion . Under a strict order of silence , the Yorkist army crept closer to the Lancastrians . During the night , neither commander spotted the opposing army , an event that proved crucial in the battle the next day . 
 During the night , Warwick ordered his cannons to continually bombard the estimated position of the Yorkists ' encampment . The Yorkists , however , had sneaked in close , and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies . The Yorkist cannon , meanwhile , kept quiet to avoid betraying their location . As the armies settled down to rest , Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops ' low morale . He suggested that , as the highest @-@ ranking commanders , the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse . The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated . By staying on foot , the Nevilles would show that they were prepared to fight to the death with the men , inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder . Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear , near Wrotham Wood . 
 = = Fighting in the mist = = 
 On 14 April 1471 , at around 4 o 'clock in the morning , both armies woke . Edward had planned for an early attack , however , and quickly roused his men to engage the Lancastrians . Both sides fired their cannon and arrows before laying into each other with polearms . The morning fog was thick and the night movements of the two forces had displaced them laterally with each other . Neither group was facing the other ; each was offset slightly to the right . This displacement meant that the right end of either army could outflank the other by wrapping around the opposing left end . The Lancastrians were the first to exploit this advantage ; Oxford 's group quickly overwhelmed Hastings ' . Yorkist soldiers fled towards Barnet , chased by the Lancastrians . Some of Hastings ' men even reached London , spreading tales of the fall of York and a Lancastrian victory . Oxford 's group disintegrated as they split off to loot the fallen enemies and plunder Barnet . <unk> and chasing after his men , Oxford rallied 800 of them and led them back to the battle . 
 Due to the fog , visibility was low and the two main forces failed to notice Oxford 's victory over Hastings . As such , the collapse of the Yorkist left wing had little ( if any ) effect on morale of either side . The fighting between Montagu 's and Edward 's groups was evenly matched and intense . The Lancastrian left wing , however , was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart ; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back . Progress for Edward 's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope . Nonetheless , the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line . Warwick , seeing the shift , ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter , and took the rest into fighting at the centre . Gradually , the battle line settled to an orientation that slanted north @-@ east to south @-@ west . 
 Oxford retraced his steps through the fog back to the fight . His group arrived , unexpectedly , at Montagu 's rear . Obscured by the fog , Oxford 's " star with rays " badge was mistaken by Montagu 's men , who believed it was Edward 's " sun in splendour " . They assumed their allies were Edward 's reserves and unleashed a volley of arrows . Oxford and his men immediately cried treachery ; as staunch Lancastrians , they were wary of Montagu 's recent defection . They struck back and began withdrawing from the battle . Their shouts of treason were taken up and spread quickly throughout the Lancastrian line , breaking it apart as men fled in anger , panic , and confusion . As the fog started to dissipate , Edward saw the Lancastrian centre in disarray and sent in his reserves , hastening its collapse . Cries of Exeter 's demise from a Yorkist axe resounded across the battlefield from the Lancastrian left , and amidst the confusion , Montagu was struck in his back and killed by either a Yorkist or one of Oxford 's men . 
 Witnessing his brother 's death , Warwick knew the battle was lost . He made for the horses in an attempt to retreat . Edward recognised his victory was at hand , and — deciding that Warwick was more valuable alive than dead — sent the order and dispatched his guards to bring back the earl alive . Several chroniclers have suggested that the king thought Warwick would again be a valuable ally if persuaded back to the Yorkist cause . Historian Michael Hicks , on the other hand , suggests that Edward wanted to capture the earl for public execution , rather than as a gesture of mercy . Regardless of the king 's intent , Warwick died in the Lancastrian rout . A miniature model reproduction of the Battle of Barnet can be found at the Battle 's natural interpretive centre , The Barnet Museum .

 The battle lasted from two to three hours , and was over by the time the fog lifted in the early morning . As usual in most battles of the time , the routed army suffered the most casualties ; fleeing men were cut down from behind . Contemporary sources give various casualty figures ; the ' Great Chronicle of London ' reports 1 @,@ 500 dead , whereas ' Warkworth 's Chronicle ' states 4 @,@ 000 . Edward Hall and Raphael Holinshed , both 16th century chroniclers , say that at least 10 @,@ 000 men died in the battle . The Yorkists suffered half as many casualties as the Lancastrians . Royle favours the recorded approximate figures of 500 Yorkists and 1 @,@ 000 Lancastrians dead . 
 The bodies of the two Neville brothers were brought back to London . They did not suffer the customary fate accorded to traitors — quartering and display at the city gates . Edward exhibited the brothers ' naked corpses in St. Paul 's Cathedral for three days to quell any rumours that they had survived , before allowing them to be laid to rest in the family vault at Bisham Abbey . 
 Although he had defeated the Neville brothers , Edward had little time to rest ; Margaret landed at Weymouth on the day of the battle . She feigned a march to London while augmenting her army with recruits from Wales and the Welsh Marches . The Lancastrian queen was disheartened by the news of Warwick 's demise , but Somerset suggested that they were better off without the earl . Despite the defeat at Barnet , Lancastrians who fled from the battle looked to the queen to restore their house to the throne . Alerted by his spies to the Lancastrians ' true route , Edward intercepted and defeated them at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471 . Gloucester , Clarence , and Hastings again fought to defend the Yorkist crown . 
 Exeter had been stripped of his armour and left for dead on the battlefield at Barnet , but he was alive — though gravely injured . His followers found him and took him to Westminster Abbey . On his recovery , he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for four years before submitting to Edward 's rule . Exeter did not participate in the later battles of the Wars of the Roses . Edward sent him on a Yorkist expedition to France in 1475 , and the duke was reported to have fallen overboard and drowned without any witnesses . 
 After withdrawing from the battle , Oxford fled to France and participated in piracy of English ships , continuing his campaign against Yorkist reign . He was eventually captured in 1473 after conquering St Michael 's Mount , an island off the south @-@ west coast of England . Twelve years later , Oxford escaped from prison and joined Henry Tudor 's fight against the Yorkists , commanding the Lancastrian army at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 .

 The Battle of Barnet was an important engagement in the Wars of the Roses : it brought about the death of a prominent figure and secured the throne for another . Despite its importance to history , contemporary records about the battle are rare . The sole chronicle based on an eyewitness account — The <unk> of Edward IV — was written by someone within Edward 's council , which presents a biased account of the battle . Another first @-@ hand observation was found in the Paston Letters , written by the Lancastrian Sir John Paston . Other records , such as The Warkworth Chronicle , offer only bits and pieces about the battle . Therefore , deficits in historical understanding must be filled through field research and discoveries of mediaeval documents . 
 Historians theorise that had Warwick 's force joined Margaret 's before challenging Edward , the combined Lancastrian army would have overwhelmed the Yorkists . Instead , Warwick 's defeat gave the Yorkists a victory so decisive that it , along with the Battle of Tewkesbury , secured the English throne for Edward IV . Historian Colin Richmond believes that Edward 's return to power was assured at Barnet — Tewkesbury was " merely an epilogue " . Without having to contend with Warwick 's popularity and political influence , the young Yorkist king could fully exert his will and rule the land unchallenged . Ballads composed during Edward 's reign celebrated his victory as sanctioned by God : " Man proposes , <unk> in <unk> , But God disposes , the <unk> <unk> <unk> " . Barnet was a disaster for the Nevilles ; their lands given away and their offices reduced . The family never again reached the prominence in English politics that they had enjoyed before the battle . 
 = = = Shakespearian dramatisation = = = 
 The battle is alluded to in William Shakespeare 's Henry VI , Part 3 ( 1595 ) . The end of Act V , scene one depicts the events leading up to the battle ; scenes two and three portray the conclusion , in which the characters discuss the combat and the fates of its participants . Shakespeare uses few details reported by contemporary chroniclers and ignores notable incidents , such as the confusion over Oxford 's and Edward 's badges . His play is based mostly on poetic and dramatic sources . In the play , Montagu is killed while trying to save his brother ( Shakespeare 's source material included Hall 's 1548 The Union of the Two Noble and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and Yorke ) , and Warwick is dragged in by Edward IV and left to speak his dying words to Oxford and Somerset . Warwick 's death dominates the scenes , reflecting Hall 's vivid portrayal of the earl 's passing as a valiant death . Furthermore , whereas several chronicles mention Edward 's desire to capture Warwick , Shakespeare has the Yorkist king lustily demand Warwick 's skin . 
 Shakespeare presents the Nevilles as brothers who are willing to die for each other , whereas the three sons of York — Edward , Gloucester , and Clarence — are slowly driven apart by their own goals and ideas . Professor of English John Cox suggests that Shakespeare did not share the impression given in post @-@ battle ballads that Edward 's triumph was divinely ordained . He argues that Shakespeare 's placement of Clarence 's last act of betrayal immediately before the battle suggests that Edward 's rule stems from his military aggression , luck , and " policy " . Shakespeare also explicitly excludes Edward from action sequences , a departure from Hall 's depictions .

 English Heritage , a government body in charge of conservation of historic sites , roughly locates the battlefield in an area 800 to 1600 metres ( 0 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 0 mile ) north of the town of Barnet . Over the centuries , much of the terrain has changed , and records of the town 's boundaries and geography are not detailed enough for English Heritage or historians to conclude the exact location of the battle . Geographical features corresponding to contemporary descriptions allow approximations of where the fighting took place . 
 English Heritage suggests that a 15th @-@ century letter from a Hanseatic merchant , Gerhard von Wessel , helps to identify the battlefield via geological features . It mentions a " broad green " which corresponds to Hadley Green , and the marsh on the right flank of the Yorkist line is likely to be in the valley of the Monken Mead brook . The letter also mentions St Albans road , which has remained largely the same , winding through the fields . Urbanisation over the 18th and 19th centuries , however , has populated much of the area with buildings . By the 20th century , the suburb of Monken Hadley covered part of the fields where the Battle of Barnet was fought . A hedge in the local golf course , as suggested by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Alfred H. Burne , is likely the row of shrubs behind which Oxford 's men lined up and took cover . 
 In 1740 , Sir Jeremy <unk> erected an obelisk to commemorate the battle about 200 metres ( 660 ft ) south of the junction between the Great North Road and Kitts End Road . It was later moved just north of the junction on the grass between the two roads . Known as Hadley <unk> , it stands 5 @.@ 5 metres ( 18 ft ) tall and marks its location with the inscription : 
 " Here was fought the Famous Battle Between Edward the 4th and the Earl of Warwick April the 14th ANNO 1471 in which the Earl was Defeated And Slain . " 
 The battle is referred to in the coat of arms of the London Borough of Barnet which display a red and a silver rose in the top of the shield and two crossed swords in the crest .

 John Caldwell Colt ( March 1 , 1810 – November 18 , 1842 ) , the brother of Samuel Colt of Colt firearm fame , was an American fur trader , bookkeeper , law clerk , and teacher . He briefly served as a Marine , forging a letter to get himself discharged after three months . After numerous business ventures he became an authority on double @-@ entry bookkeeping and published a textbook on the subject , which went through 45 editions and remained in continuous publication 13 years after his death . 
 In 1842 Colt was convicted of the murder of a printer named Samuel Adams , to whom Colt owed money over the publication of a bookkeeping textbook . Colt killed Adams with a hatchet the previous year in what he claimed was self @-@ defense , but he had afterwards covered up the crime by disposing of the body . When the body was discovered , Colt was the first suspect . The trial became a sensation in the New York press , because of his family connections , the manner of disposal , and Colt 's somewhat arrogant demeanor in the courtroom . Colt was found guilty and sentenced to hang in 1842 , but committed suicide on the morning of his execution . 
 Conspiracy theories circulated about the suicide , with some holding that Colt had in fact escaped from prison and staged a body to look like his own . One publication alleged that a family member smuggled the knife used in the suicide into his cell . Others stated that Colt was living in California with his wife , Caroline . None of these allegations were ever proven . Edgar Allan Poe may have based a short story , " The Oblong Box " , partly on the murder of Adams , and Herman Melville alluded to the case in his short story " Bartleby , the Scrivener " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Colt was born in Hartford , Connecticut . His father was Christopher Colt , a farmer who had moved his family to Hartford when he changed professions and became a businessman . Christopher had eight children with his first Sarah ( née Caldwell ) . Two died in childhood ; the eldest sister Margaret died of tuberculosis when John was 13 ; and brother Samuel went on to achieve fame and fortune through his founding of the Colt 's Manufacturing Company . 
 When John was nine , his father sent him to Hopkins Academy ; the next year , the father took him out again , in part because the boy was in constant trouble and in part because the father had lost his fortune in the Panic of 1819 . 
 John 's mother died of tuberculosis when John was eleven . The children were then cared for by the Christopher 's sister , Lucretia Colt Price , until Christopher remarried two years later Olivia Sargeant . 
 Christopher had three more children with Olivia . As money was now tight , Olivia insisted that her stepchildren put to work rather than receive schooling . The Colt brothers became attached to their one surviving sister , Sarah Ann , who acted as a surrogate mother of sorts , until she was sent off to a relative 's house to work as a menial . John was known to keep locks of hair belonging to her and Margaret all through his life . 
 At age 14 , Colt started work as an assistant bookkeeper for the Union Manufacturing Company in Marlborough , Connecticut . He left the job and moved to Albany , New York in less than a year . He returned to Hartford in 1826 and studied at an academy for three months . In 1827 he found employment as a math teacher at a ladies seminary in Baltimore , Maryland for a year . In 1828 he became a supervisory engineer for a canal near Wilkes @-@ Barre , Pennsylvania . The following year his sister Sarah Ann committed suicide by taking arsenic ; one newspaper account stated it was due to a fight with her stepmother and another said she " took a morbid view of her doom to labor " until her " fortitude and her mind gave way " . Devastated by this loss , John vowed to " leave the country and pass the rest of his days in some foreign land " . In despair , he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps . His orders were for a Mediterranean cruise on the U.S.S. Constitution ; illness prevented him from serving on the ship and he worked as a clerk in Norfolk , Virginia for a Colonel Anderson . 
 Colt spent three months as a marine and was disillusioned with the military lifestyle ; clerking in a humid port was not the adventurous life he had envisioned . He was still very ill , but not ill enough for a medical discharge , so he forged a letter in the name of " George Hamilton " , a farmer from Ware , Massachusetts , stating that his underage son had falsely enlisted under the name of John Colt . He mailed the letter to his brother James and asked him to mail it to Colonel Anderson from Ware . Anderson discharged Colt within days of receiving the letter , citing Colt 's illness as the reason and not fraudulent enlistment . 
 Upon his discharge , Colt spent a year as a law clerk for his cousin , Dudley Selden . At the same time he became a riverboat gambler and was challenged to a duel over a shared mistress . Although the duel was never fought , this incident became part of Colt 's backstory as a roughneck , street fighting gambler . He traveled to Vermont in 1830 as a debate coach for the University of Vermont , at Burlington ; however , he left after a year due to symptoms of tuberculosis . Colt then traveled to the Great Lakes to recuperate and bought a farm in Michigan on Gooden 's Lake ; however , tubercular symptoms surfaced again and he soon left for Cincinnati , Ohio , where he became a teacher of one of the first correspondence courses in America ; he also became a center of a Bohemian circle , and counted John Howard Payne and Hiram Powers among his friends . 
 From there he attempted many business ventures throughout the United States : land speculator in Texas , soap manufacturer in New York , grocery wholesaler in Georgia , fur trader , dry @-@ goods merchant in Florida , and an organizer of Mardi Gras masquerade balls in New Orleans .

 While teaching in Louisville in 1834 , Colt began lecturing on " Italian Book @-@ keeping " , or double @-@ entry bookkeeping . He toured the United States giving a series of lectures on the topic and by 1837 had begun writing a textbook on the subject . 
 His textbook , The Italian science of double @-@ entry book @-@ keeping : simplified , arranged and <unk> , received glowing reviews . Colt had the book published in Boston , New York , Philadelphia , and Cincinnati , and by 1839 over 200 schools were using it . Colt dropped " Italian " from the title for the second edition and included transcripts of his lectures in the newer editions ; the book went through 45 printings and was in publication until 1855 . 
 Shortly after publishing the first edition of his textbook , Colt went into partnership with the publisher , Nathan G. <unk> under the name Colt , Burgess & Co , in Cincinnati , Ohio . The new firm almost went bankrupt after publishing An Introduction into the Origin of Antiquities in America by John Delafield Jr . The scholarship of the text was dubious and the book was available by subscription only . Hoping for a better market for Delafield 's book , Colt moved to 14 Cortland Street in Manhattan , New York in 1839 . The office doubled as Colt 's residence and Colt made his own shipping crates there . 
 = = Murder of Samuel Adams = = 
 On September 17 , 1841 , a New York printer named Samuel Adams went to see Colt to collect a debt over some textbooks that Adams had printed for him . The two disagreed over the final amount owed ; sources indicate that it was a discrepancy of $ 1 @.@ 35 . According to Colt , Adams began choking him with his cravat . In self @-@ defense , Colt reached for what he thought was a hammer to fend him off , but the weapon turned out to be a hatchet . Colt struck Adams four or five times with the weapon , causing Adams to drop to the floor . 
 Upon seeing that Adams was dead , Colt cleaned up the blood . The next morning ( September 18 ) , Colt placed the body into a large shipping crate and packed it with salt . He then addressed it to a non @-@ existent address in New Orleans and hired a car @-@ man named Barstow to deliver it to a ship named the Kalamazoo , scheduled to leave the next morning . 
 After a day or so , Adams ' family began searching the city for him , placing notices in several newspapers such as the New York Courier and Enquirer and the New York Weekly Tribune notifying people he was missing . A neighbor of Colt 's , Asa H. Wheeler , told Adams ' father @-@ in @-@ law , Joseph Lane , that he had heard noises in Colt 's office that sounded like a fight followed by a crash to the floor . <unk> in the keyhole , he saw someone " bending over something on the floor " . Wheeler later secured a key from the landlord and saw that a large packing crate was missing and that the floor had been scrubbed . On September 22 , 1841 , Colt visited Adams ' print shop inquiring about the status of his books and the whereabouts of Adams . Adams ' bookbinder , Charles Wells , told Colt that the last time Adams had been seen was on the way to visit Colt himself . Colt made no reply to the implied allegation , and excused himself . 
 Lane , Wheeler , and an employee of Adams named John Loud examined Adams ' ledgers for any transactions involving Colt and went to the mayor of New York City , Robert Hunter Morris , with the evidence . Other witnesses said that Adams was last seen entering Colt 's apartment on September 17 and that Colt had a crate delivered by a carman the next day . The mayor asked the Superintendent of Carts , William Godfrey , to locate the carman in question and determine the location of the crate . Godfrey found Barstow , who told him the parcel had been delivered to the freighter Kalamazoo . 
 The Kalamazoo was still in port , delayed from sailing by a storm . The New York police , accompanied by the city 's mayor and the carman , boarded the ship and asked if the crate was still in the cargo hold . The decomposing body had already started emitting a strong odor , which ship hands had assumed was a poison put out to kill rats . The stevedore opened the crate , revealing a half @-@ naked male corpse wrapped in a shop awning , bound with rope and packed with salt . A scar on the body 's leg and a single gold ring identified the body as Adams . 
 = = Arrest and trial = = 
 Colt was arrested on September 23 by New York Police and the city 's mayor . Adams ' gold pocketwatch engraved with an image of the US Capitol was found among his possessions . The trial began on January 13 , 1842 . Colt was represented by a team of three attorneys led by his cousin Dudley Selden ( under whom he had clerked ) , John Morrill and Robert Emmett . The three were paid in stock from Samuel Colt 's new company : Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of Paterson , New Jersey . The Chief Prosecutor was James R. Whiting , the New York County District Attorney . The presiding judge was William Kent . 
 = = = Tried by the press = = = 
 The Colt @-@ Adams Murder trial dominated the popular press at the time , and eclipsed coverage of another New York murder , that of Mary Rogers . The press depicted Colt as a former professional riverboat gambler who had public affairs with women and a common @-@ law wife and who committed perjury to enlist in and exit the Marines . Although the nature of the crime , and the fact that Colt cohabited with an unmarried pregnant woman , Caroline Henshaw , added to the publicity , most of it was due to John Colt 's relationship to Samuel Colt . Coverage appeared in New York papers such as The Sun , which incorrectly labeled a picture of P.T. Barnum purchased from the Albany Evening Atlas as a picture of Adams . Religious magazines such as The Catholic Herald , Evangelical Magazine , Episcopal Recorder and Gospel Advocate used the story to demonstrate such problems as the " lack of morality in the home " . 
 Throughout the trial Colt was repeatedly found guilty of " cold @-@ blooded murder " in the New York press . The October 30 issue of the weekly Tribune quoted James Colt , then practicing law in St Louis as saying " insanity is hereditary in our family " . James Gordon Bennett wrote lengthy editorials in the New York Herald about Colt 's " confidence , assurance , and impudence " and that his " limitless potential has been undermined by a want of moral and religious culture " . The major exception was The Knickerbocker in which Lewis Gaylord Clark reported the murder as a " <unk> accident " . Colt 's lawyers continually petitioned Judge Kent to forbid press coverage , but Kent refused them saying , " The Court has done everything to prevent the jury from being influenced from without " . 
 = = = Murder weapon = = = 
 Halfway through the trial , Whiting made allegations that Adams had been murdered with a Colt Paterson revolver rather than a hatchet . Whiting came to this conclusion after Doctor Gilman , who examined the body with the coroner , testified about a round hole in Adams skull that could not have been made by the hatchet and suggested that Colt used a revolver in a premeditated act by which he lured Adams to his death . Although no witnesses had reported the sounds of gunfire , Whiting 's argument was that a revolver ball fired under the power of the percussion cap alone could propel the ball with " enough force to kill a man " , without making the noise of the exploding black powder in the cylinder . Several witnesses were called in to testify against this idea including an early <unk> named <unk> and Samuel Colt himself , who demonstrated to the court , by shooting his revolver in the courtroom and catching the fired balls in his hand , that such a shot could not penetrate to the depth of the wound found on Adams ' skull . 
 Over Selden 's objections , Whiting had the coroner , David L. Rogers , bring Adams ' skull and the hatchet into the courtroom to show the jury the direction and number of strikes made . John Colt was reported as " covering his face " at this demonstration . The cylindrical wound which Whiting and Gilman thought was made by a ball fired from a revolver was actually caused by one of the nails used by Colt to seal the crate . Gilman conceded that the wound was caused by a nail and admitted that no foreign object such as a ball from a revolver was found in the victim 's head . 
 Colt admitted he had killed Adams and planned to confess before he was arrested . He attested that he acted in self @-@ defense . 
 I then sat down , for I felt weak and sick . After sitting a few minutes , and seeing so much blood , I think I went and looked at poor Adams , who breathed quite loud for several minutes , then threw his arms out and was silent . I recollect at this time taking him by the hand , which seemed lifeless , and a horrid thrill came over me , that I had killed him . – John C. Colt 
 Colt said his first thought was to burn down the building to destroy the evidence , but reconsidered as a number of people lived in the building and rather than " cause more carnage " he reconsidered . He then decided to dispose of the body in a large packing crate and wrapped it in an awning and bound it with rope . After scrubbing the floor he threw Adams ' clothing into a nearby outdoor privy , then stopped at the Washington bathhouse on Pearl Street to wash the blood from his clothes and hands . 
 = = = The verdict = = = 
 Closing arguments were made on January 23 . Selden argued that Colt had acted in self @-@ defense as Adams had been choking him and Colt 's only means to defend himself was to grab a nearby weapon . His defense for hiding the body was temporary insanity . Whiting countered in a two @-@ hour @-@ long rebuttal that the killing was premeditated ; he pointed to Colt 's demeanor at the trial , the taking of Adams ' watch , the leaving of a hatchet in plain view , and Colt 's method of disposing of the body as evidence contradicting Colt 's claim that his actions were that of an innocent man acting in self @-@ defense . Judge Kent dismissed the argument for self @-@ defense based on Colt 's attempted cover @-@ up and instructed the jury that since Colt had confessed to the murder that they were to determine whether the charge should be murder or manslaughter . Kent remarked on Colt 's " careless air " demonstrated throughout the trial in the courtroom and said his behavior was " not typical of an innocent man " . The jury was disturbed by Colt 's demeanor throughout the trial , agreeing with the judge that Colt appeared stoic , <unk> and callous when describing his disposal of Adams ' body . On January 24 , after deliberating for over 10 hours , the jury found Colt guilty of willful murder . 
 Colt 's team requested an appeal and argued the case on May 5 , 1842 , asking for a new trial as the jury at the previous was misinformed ; on May 12 a new trial was denied so the lawyers appealed to the State Supreme Court located in Utica , New York . The State Supreme Court heard the case on July 16 , 1842 and upheld the earlier court 's decision . Colt 's sentencing date was scheduled for September 27 , 1842 . Undaunted , Colt 's lawyers recruited Rogers , the surgeon who performed Adams ' autopsy " to investigate the probable relative position and actions " of Colt and Adams during their struggle . By analyzing the number , shape , and position of the wounds and the blood splatter ; Rogers deduced that the two " grappled face to face within a foot @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half of each other " and " Adams was in an erect position at the time the fatal blows were inflicted . The report was submitted to Governor William H. Seward in the hope of securing a pardon for Colt . Seward was overwhelmed with requests asking for a pardon for Colt , including those from 36 lawyers who visited him personally in Albany as well as from judges and attorneys close to Seward such as Judge Ambrose Spencer and former Attorney General Willis Hall . Seward in the end would not pardon Colt , as he felt the attempted cover @-@ up of the crime and Colt 's demeanor throughout the trial were not the actions of a " penitent man " . 
 The prisoner has forgotten his victim , heaped insult upon his humble and bereaved family , defied the court , denounced the jury , and presented himself before the executive as an injured , not a penitent man . – William H. Seward 
 = = Marriage and death = = 
 On September 28 , 1842 , after exhausting his final appeal , Colt was sentenced to death by hanging and remanded to New York City 's infamous prison , the Tombs . His sentence was to be carried out on November 14 , 1842 . Colt asked that he be allowed to marry Caroline Henshaw on the morning of his hanging . While imprisoned , Colt lived luxuriously in his prison cell , receiving daily visits from friends and family , smoking Cuban cigars , sleeping in an actual bed instead of a mound of straw and wearing silk dressing gowns inside and a seal skin overcoat for his daily walks in the prison yard . His cell contained the latest novels , a gilded bird cage with a canary and fresh flowers brought to him every day by Henshaw . He dined on meals from local hotels such as quail on toast , game <unk> , reed birds , and <unk> . Several attempts were made to break him out of the prison by dressing him in women 's clothing but all these efforts were foiled . A doctor was hired who claimed he could resuscitate Colt from the hanging , providing the body did not remain suspended long , as he believed Colt 's neck to be of such thickness that strangulation would be impossible . Colt 's friends put the doctor up in the Shakespeare Hotel on the morning of the scheduled hanging and planned to bring the body there from the Tombs for resuscitation . 
 On the morning of November 14 , 1842 , Colt and Henshaw were married in the prison at a small ceremony conducted by Rev Henry Anthon , an Episcopal Minister , and witnessed by Samuel Colt and John Howard Payne . After the ceremony and a few hours before the scheduled execution , a fire broke out in the Tombs . After the fire was extinguished , Colt 's body was found in his cell . He had stabbed himself in the heart with a clasp knife , believed to have been smuggled to him by a family member . His body was taken by Rev Anthon and buried in the churchyard of St. Mark 's Church in @-@ the @-@ Bowery . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 As the trial had made headlines in the daily newspapers , so did Colt 's death . Theories were put forth that Colt had killed another prisoner and escaped during the fire . One newspaper account said that Colt had fled to California with his wife , as did a book published by a former New York Chief of Police . A man named Samuel M. Everett claimed he met John Colt ( or a man who looked identical ) in the Santa Clara Valley in California in 1852 , and the account was published in Pearson 's Magazine . Harold Schechter , a researcher and author of two books about John Colt dismisses this as " an outlandish tale " and a " product of folklore , not fact " . A New York Times article written in 1880 said that Caroline Henshaw was watched by private detectives for years after Colt 's death and no sign was ever seen of him alive . None of these speculations of Colt 's escape were proven to be true . 
 Colt historian William Edwards wrote that Caroline Henshaw married Samuel Colt in Scotland when Colt met her in Europe and that the son she bore was Samuel Colt 's and not John Colt 's . In a 1953 biography about Samuel Colt based largely on family letters , Edwards wrote that John 's marriage to Caroline was a way to legitimize her son , Sammy . Samuel Colt had abandoned her because he felt she was not fit to be the wife of an industrialist and divorce was a social stigma at the time . Samuel Colt took care of the child named Samuel Caldwell Colt financially with a large allowance and paid for his tuition in what was described as " the finest private schools " . In correspondence with and about his namesake , Samuel Colt referred to him as his " nephew " in quotes . Historians such as Edwards and Harold Schechter have said this was the elder Colt 's way of letting the world know that the boy was his own son without directly saying so . After Samuel Colt 's death in 1862 , he left the boy $ 2 million by 2010 standards . Colt 's widow , Elizabeth Jarvis Colt , and her brother contested this . In probate Caroline 's son Sam produced a valid marriage license showing that Caroline and Samuel Colt were married in Scotland in 1838 and that this document made him a rightful heir to part of Colt 's estate , if not to the Colt Manufacturing Company . 
 = Space Gun ( video game ) = 
 Space Gun ( <unk> , <unk> Gan ) is a first @-@ person , shoot ' em up arcade game released by Taito in 1990 . It was later distributed for various home games consoles in 1992 , and in 2005 , it was included as part of the compilation Taito Legends on the PlayStation 2 , PC and Xbox . It is set aboard a crippled space station that has been overrun by hostile alien creatures ; there are human crew members that the player must attempt to rescue while destroying the alien creatures . Space Gun features simulated gore , giving the player the ability to shoot limbs off the creatures while blood splatters appear on screen . Various weapon upgrades can be found during gameplay . The music from the game is featured on several commercially released compact discs . It was fairly well received by critics both in arcades and when released for home systems . It was one of only a few games that supported a light gun peripheral for some of the home systems releases . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game is set in a fictional future , in the year 2039 , where humans have begun deep space exploration . A distress call is transmitted from a crippled ship near an alien planet . The game 's protagonist , a special soldier , responds to the call . Upon boarding the ship , the soldier discovers it has been overrun by hostile aliens . The aliens have captured the human crew for an unknown purpose . The story has sections that take place aboard the space craft and on the planet 's surface . The protagonist 's overall goal is to rescue as many human hostages as possible , eliminate the alien threat , and escape the space craft . 
 Space Gun is an Arcade Rail Shooter in which the player views the on @-@ screen action from a first person perspective . Players use a cabinet mounted light gun to target and shoot enemies . Enemies are either mechanical guns that descend from above the screen or aliens , several of which can only be defeated by first shooting away their limbs . The player must save human hostages from the creatures . Occasionally , a hostage will mutate into an alien . In addition to the standard rapid fire weapon , there are four other weapons : a flamethrower , grenade launcher , freeze bomb , and blade bomb . These weapons require ammunition which can be collected throughout the stages , and are activated by the player using the pump action of the mounted gun . The arcade cabinet features foot pedals ( visible in picture ) that , when pressed , reverse the player 's direction . This is an essential feature , as it allows the player more time to fire upon an incoming enemy and to also help keep the number of enemies at a more manageable level and thereby keep from being overwhelmed . It also adds an element of strategy to the game , as over @-@ use of the " <unk> " runs the risk of running out of time on the level . 
 There are six or seven levels ( depending on which version of the game is being played ) that are split into four subsections , each with its own end @-@ of @-@ level boss . Between levels the story is explained and moved forward through the use of short animated cut @-@ scenes with text on the screen . Players can often choose their own path through the level by selecting a door or arrow using the gun . Several of the home system versions feature light gun support ; however , all of them allow the player to move a crosshair to target enemies . The multiplayer game is identical to the single @-@ player experience , but the Sega Master System , Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions do not feature multiplayer . 
 = = Development and history = = 
 The arcade game features raster graphics on a CRT monitor displaying 4096 colors and amplified stereophonic sound . The visuals are reflected into view via a mirror in the cabinet . The arcade cabinet is upright , with the marquee bearing the game 's name protruding outward . There are large , blue plastic molds around the cabinet designed to resemble an alien cocoon . The music for Space Gun was composed by Norihiro Furukawa and Naoto <unk> of Zuntata , Taito 's music division . A soundtrack CD ( a split release with the soundtrack for Taito game Liquid Kids ) was released by Pony Canyon and Scitron on January 21 , 1991 . This album was also released as part of Taito 1500 Collector 's Box on September 17 , 1993 . A track from the game is on the limited edition CD Zuntata History L 'ab @-@ normal 1st , released by Zuntata / Taito on April 1 , 1999 . 
 = = = Home conversions = = = 
 In 1992 , Ocean Software ported the game to home gaming systems , including the Amiga , Atari ST , Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum . Due to the hardware limitations of the various systems , the graphics and sounds of the ports differ from the original arcade version ; for example , the ZX Spectrum version did not allow the aliens ' limbs to be shot off . Some home versions use a light gun peripheral to simulate the control scheme of the arcade format . Taito 's Sega Master System port uses the Sega Light Phaser accessory . The Amiga and Atari ST versions are one of the few games to use the Trojan Light Gun . In developing the Amiga conversion , the team video taped the arcade machine in operation as a reference for the graphics , pausing the video at relevant spots to take notes before recreating them . Programmer Damien Stones spent four months on the ZX Spectrum version . He kept the graphical detail of the backgrounds simple to allow for more action in the foreground . Taking into account the system 's lower capabilities compared to the arcade hardware , Stones designed the game to handle a large number of on @-@ screen sprites . As a result , Space Gun becomes more efficient the more action occurs on the screen , but will slow down during lulls in the game . In 2005 , Space Gun was included in the compilation title Taito Legends for the PlayStation 2 , personal computer and Xbox . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Space Gun was well received by the video game press . In issue 34 of Zero , Amaya <unk> gave the original arcade version of the game four out of five stars . Jonnie Cook of Sinclair User described the arcade release as enjoyable to those that already liked the genre , but stated he preferred other games . Killer List of Videogames called the cabinet design " quite unique " . In March 1992 , Gary Whitta of Advanced Computer Entertainment magazine stated that the sections that scroll into the screen are a lot easier to play than the horizontally scrolling sections . The screen can quickly fill up with enemies , which can lead to confusion as to what the player is shooting at , especially when human hostages run across the screen as they can be inadvertently killed . Neil West of Amiga Format commented that the title has a high difficulty level and that power @-@ ups are a necessity to continue playing . The " not perfect " rapid fire weapon ( which needs recharging after prolonged use ) contributes to the game 's difficulty , as stated by Brian Sharp of Games @-@ X magazine . 
 Several publications compared the game 's plot to that of the 1979 film Alien . Simon Forrester of Your Sinclair jokingly referred to Space Gun as the " unofficial game " of the film . Zero magazine gave particular praise to the sections where humans mutate into aliens as they run towards the player . Your Sinclair reviewer Jon Pillar and Chris Buffa of GameDaily said that Space Gun contains graphic violence , citing the visual effect of entrails and blood splashed against the screen . Steve Merritt of CU Amiga described the sound effects , specifically alien squeals and the pumping heartbeat , as " simple , but effective " . 
 On release for home platforms , the game received mixed reviews in the press , ranging from 69 % in Amiga Format to 84 % in CU Amiga magazine . A preview from Amiga Power described Space Gun as deriving from an " inexplicably popular coin @-@ op , best described as Line of Fire set in space . " Several reviews have stated that Space Gun is an Operation Wolf clone , while it has also been compared unfavorably to Operation Thunderbolt . Sega Power magazine reviewed the Master System version , giving the game a score of 70 % if the player is using a Light Phaser , but only 50 % if a control pad is being used . Paul Presley of The One for Amiga Games also found that using input devices other that the guns mounted to the arcade machine " just isn 't the same " . Prior to the release for the Xbox and PS2 as part of Taito Legends the game was regarded by <unk> as being in the " top five " of the games in the collection , and on release the same website described it as " thoroughly enjoyable " . 
 = Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock / Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental = 
 The Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock / Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental was an award presented at the 31st Grammy Awards in 1989 to honor quality hard rock / metal works ( albums or songs ) . The Grammy Awards , an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards , are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to " honor artistic achievement , technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry , without regard to album sales or chart position . " 
 The Academy recognized hard rock music artists for the first time in 1989 with the category Best Hard Rock / Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental , combining two of the most popular music genres of the <unk> , who were expected to win the inaugural award for their album ... And Justice for All , lost to Jethro Tull whose album Crest of a Knave won instead . This choice led to widespread criticism of the Academy , as journalists suggested that Jethro Tull 's music did not belong in either the hard rock or heavy metal genres . In response , the Academy separated the genres creating the categories Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance . This incident is often considered an example of the Grammy Awards being out of touch with popular sentiment , and was named the biggest upset in Grammy history by Entertainment Weekly . 
 In 2012 , the combined Hard Rock / Metal category returned following a major overhaul of Grammy Award categories . The separate Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance categories were merged into the slightly renamed Best Hard Rock / Metal Performance category . However , in June 2013 , it was announced that the combined category was being discontinued in favor of reinstating Best Metal Performance . Beginning in 2014 , quality hard rock performances were recognized under the category Best Rock Performance . 
 = = Award = = 
 In 1988 , the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences added a Hard Rock / Metal Performance category for the 31st Grammy Awards . Nominated works for the award included Blow Up Your Video by AC / DC , " Cold Metal " by Iggy Pop ( from the album Instinct ) , Nothing 's Shocking by Jane 's Addiction , Crest of a Knave by Jethro Tull , and ... And Justice for All by Metallica . Jethro Tull 's lead singer Ian Anderson was surprised by the band 's nomination , as both Anderson and music critics did not consider the group 's music to be part of the heavy metal music genre . 
 Metallica 's performance at the ceremony , held in February 1989 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles , marked the first time a heavy metal group had performed during the Grammy Awards . Metallica was expected to win the award , and members of Jethro Tull were told by their record label Chrysalis Records not to bother attending the ceremony because they " weren 't likely to win . " However , Jethro Tull won the award ( recipients included members Ian Anderson , Martin Barre , and Dave Pegg ) , and when presenters Alice Cooper and Lita Ford announced the result , booing could be heard from the crowd . Anderson , who assumed that the band was being recognized for their twenty @-@ year history , as opposed to a single album , later stated that he was " lucky " not to have attended the ceremony , admitting that there was " no way [ he ] could have accepted [ the award ] under those circumstances . " 
 = = Controversy and aftermath = = 
 The result , considered an " embarrassment " for the Academy , generated much controversy . In response to the criticism they received over the award , Jethro Tull 's record label took out an advertisement in Billboard magazine with a picture of a flute ( part of their trademark sound ) lying amid a pile of iron <unk> and the line , " The flute is a heavy , metal instrument ! " Metallica also added a sticker to subsequent releases of ... And Justice for All , reading : " Grammy Award <unk> " . 
 Separate awards for Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance were introduced in 1990 . Beginning that year , Metallica won three consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance for the song " One " from ... And Justice for All , their cover of Queen 's " Stone Cold Crazy " , and their eponymous album in 1992 . When Metallica won the Grammy in 1992 , drummer Lars Ulrich referenced the previous award by facetiously " thanking " Jethro Tull for not putting out an album that year , though they actually had released the album Catfish Rising in 1991 . A decade after Jethro Tull defeated Metallica , Ulrich admitted : " I 'd be lying if I didn 't tell you I was disappointed . Human nature is that you 'd rather win than lose , but Jethro Tull walking away with it makes a huge mockery of the intentions of the event . " As of 2010 , Metallica holds the record for the most wins in the metal category , with a total of six . 
 This incident is often cited as an example of the Grammy Awards selection committee being out of touch with popular sentiment , and was named the biggest upset in Grammy history by Entertainment Weekly . Other publications that have included the Best Hard Rock / Metal Performance upset in their lists of top Grammy moments include Cracked.com ( number one ) , Time ( number ten ) , and the Ventura County Star ( number twenty ) .

 X Japan ( エックス ・ <unk> , Ekkusu Japan ) is a Japanese heavy metal band from Chiba , formed in 1982 by drummer Yoshiki and lead vocalist Toshi . Predominantly a power / speed metal band with heavy symphonic elements , they later gravitated towards a progressive sound with an emphasis on ballads . Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label , the group is widely credited as one of the pioneers of visual kei , a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam . 
 Originally named X ( エックス , Ekkusu ) , they released their debut album Vanishing Vision ( 1988 ) on Yoshiki 's own Extasy Records a year after finalizing their line @-@ up including bassist Taiji , lead guitarist hide and rhythm guitarist Pata . They achieved breakthrough success in 1989 with the release of their second and major debut album Blue Blood . Following 1991 's Jealousy , Taiji left the band in early 1992 . He was replaced by Heath and the group changed their name to X Japan before producing the mini album Art of Life ( 1993 ) , which is composed solely of the 29 @-@ minute title track . In 1995 the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look and released Dahlia ( 1996 ) , which like their two previous albums debuted at number one . X Japan performed their last concert at the Tokyo Dome on December 31 , 1997 , making it the last of five consecutive sold @-@ out New Year 's Eve concerts the group held at the stadium . 
 After ten years , X Japan reunited in 2007 and recorded the new song " I.V. " . Over the next two years they performed several concerts , including their first overseas show in Hong Kong , and formally added Sugizo as lead guitarist in place of Hide , who died in 1998 , before holding a North American tour in 2010 . In 2011 , the band went on their first world tour throughout Europe , South America and Asia . 
 X Japan has released five studio albums , six live albums , and 21 singles . Three of their albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Oricon chart . In 2003 , HMV Japan ranked the band at number 40 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts .

Dynamite changed its name to Noise in 1978 , while they were still in high school . In 1982 , Noise disbanded and Yoshiki and Toshi formed a new band , they named it X while they tried to think of another name , but the name stuck . X began to actively perform in the Tokyo area in 1985 with a frequently changing lineup . Their first single , " I 'll Kill You " was released on Dada Records in June and the band contributed " Break the Darkness " to the sampler Heavy Metal Force III in November , which also featured a song by Saver Tiger . In November 1985 bassist Taiji ( ex : Dementia ) joined X , though he left the group shortly thereafter . 
 To ensure a continuous outlet for the band 's music , Yoshiki founded the independent label Extasy Records in April 1986 , and released their second single " Orgasm " . Taiji would officially rejoin the band in November of that same year . The songs " Stab Me in the Back " and " No Connexion " , for the February 1987 Victor Records sampler Skull Thrash Zone Volume I , were recorded with Pata ( ex : Judy ) as a support guitar player . Soon after these recordings hide ( ex : Saver Tiger ) joined as a guitarist .

On December 26 , 1987 , the band participated in an audition held by CBS / Sony which led to a recording contract in August of the following year . In the meantime the band released its first album , Vanishing Vision through Extasy Records on April 14 , 1988 , and toured extensively in support of the record . The album 's first press of 10 @,@ 000 copies sold out in a week , topping the Oricon indies chart and reaching number 19 on the main chart . The Vanishing Tour Vol.2 took the band to 20 locations for 24 shows from June to July , while the Burn Out Tour had 12 performances throughout October . In November , X participated in music magazine Rockin <unk> Street Fighting Men concert at <unk> Ariake Arena . That year the members also made a brief cameo appearance in the American film Tokyo Pop , starring Carrie Hamilton and Diamond <unk> . 
 X 's sold out Blue Blood Tour started on March 13 , with two of the concerts selling out in advanced , including the March 16 show at Shibuya Public Hall , which was later released on home video as Blue Blood Tour <unk> <unk> Gig . The album Blue Blood was released on April 21 , 1989 , and debuted at number six on the Oricon chart . The single " Kurenai " reached number five and the band went on the Rose and Blood tour , which was temporarily suspended when Yoshiki collapsed after a November 22 concert . This success earned the band the " Grand Prix New Artist of the Year " award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards in 1990 . On November 24 , 1990 , X flew to Los Angeles to begin recording their follow @-@ up album , Jealousy . When members arrived back in Japan in June , 500 members of the Japan Self @-@ Defence Forces were at the airport to control the crowd . The album was released on July 1 , 1991 , and debuted at number one , selling over 600 @,@ 000 copies . It was later certified million by the RIAJ . In August the band performed their first concert at Japan 's largest indoor concert venue , the Tokyo Dome . Footage from most of the band 's shows in that stadium would later be released on CD and home video . The show was part of the Violence in Jealousy tour , which lasted to the end of the year and once again saw Yoshiki collapse after the October 24 Yokohama Arena gig . December 8 saw the X with Orchestra concert at NHK Hall , where , as the name suggests , the band performed backed by an orchestra . 
 1992 began with three sold out concerts at the Tokyo Dome , titled Tokyo Dome 3 Days ~ On the Verge of Destruction ~ , on January 5 – 7 . The title was possibly more meaningful than it appears at first glance , as on January 31 it was announced that bass player Taiji had left the group . The official reason given for his departure was due to musical differences . However , in his autobiography , Taiji claims he was asked to leave because he confronted Yoshiki due to the substantial income gap between Yoshiki and each of the other members . On August 24 , 1992 , the band held a press conference in New York at Rockefeller Center . There , Heath ( ex : Media Youth ) was announced as their new bass player . Around this time , the band 's success in Japan made an international breakthrough appear likely , leading to them leaving Sony for an American record contract with Atlantic Records and the renaming of the band from X to X Japan , in order to distinguish from the American punk group X. ( An American album release would never happen . ) Their first show with Heath was at the October 1992 Extasy Summit at Osaka @-@ jō Hall .

 Art of Life was released on August 28 , 1993 , by Atlantic Records , and consists solely of the 29 @-@ minute , heavily orchestrated title track . It debuted at number one , however the band only performed two concerts that year , as each member began solo careers . <unk> titled X Japan Returns , the concerts were held at the Tokyo Dome on December 30 and 31 , marking the beginning of a New Year 's Eve tradition that would last until the group 's disbandment . The solo careers continued into the following year , with X Japan only performing four shows . The first two were the last two days of The Great Music Experience , and the others were December 30 – 31 at the Tokyo Dome , titled Aoi Yoru ( <unk> , Blue Night ) and Shiroi Yoru ( <unk> , White Night ) respectively . 
 1995 was also quiet , until November 19 when the band began the tour for their next album , Dahlia Tour 1995 – 1996 . Around this time , the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look . While it wasn 't released until November 4 , 1996 , singles from the album had been released as early as a few months after Art of Life . Though this caused Dahlia to contain relatively little new material , the album reached number one on the charts . The tour was originally scheduled to end on March 31 , 1996 , however , it was cut short when Yoshiki herniated cervical vertebrae after the March 13 show . They did however perform their tradition of two Tokyo Dome concerts on December 30 – 31 , titled Resurrection Night ( <unk> ) and Reckless Night ( <unk> ) . 
 On September 22 , 1997 , at 1pm , Yoshiki , hide , Pata and Heath held a press conference where they announced that X Japan would disband . Vocalist Toshi decided to leave the band as the glamorous , success @-@ oriented life of a rock star failed to satisfy him emotionally , as opposed to a simpler life and career . He stated that he had made the decision back in April 1996 , though it was not publicly disclosed . However , around twelve years later he confirmed what was long @-@ reported in the media ; he was " brainwashed " via violence and abuse and conned out of money , leading to bankruptcy . X Japan performed their farewell show , aptly titled The Last Live ~ Last Night ~ , at the Tokyo Dome on December 31 , 1997 , making it the last of five consecutive New Year 's Eves the group performed at the stadium . Although later that same day they played " Forever Love " at that year 's Kōhaku Uta Gassen , marking their true last performance .

 While reissues , compilations and live footage continued to be released , the members of X Japan pursued solo careers and other <unk> hide , who released his first solo album Hide Your Face in 1994 , continued his solo career with a sound distinctively different from X Japan 's music , leaning more towards alternative rock , until his death on May 2 , 1998 . Just two months later , the debut album 3 @.@ 2 @.@ 1 @.@ from his American @-@ based band Zilch , which included Ray McVeigh ( The Professionals ) , Paul Raven ( Killing Joke ) and Joey Castillo ( Queens of the Stone Age ) , was released . His third solo album Ja , Zoo , formally including his live band Spread Beaver , was released and became his most successful , having reached number one and sold over a million copies . 
 Toshi 's solo career , which began in 1992 , has been extensive , with him having released over 30 albums and performed numerous acoustic shows for smaller audiences . According to his website , his <unk> Traveling Concert tour included over 3 @,@ 000 concerts between 1999 and 2003 . 
 After both having released solo albums in the early 90s , Pata and Heath teamed up with Spread Beaver percussionist / programmer <unk> , who worked on several of X Japan 's releases , to provide a track for the 1998 hide tribute album Tribute Spirits . The three would reunite again in 2000 to form Dope <unk> , which released two albums before ceasing activity . Heath then continued his solo career and Pata formed the instrumental rock group Ra : IN , which later added Spread Beaver keyboardist DIE . 
 Before the band 's breakup , Yoshiki had already independently collaborated with Queen drummer Roger Taylor on the single " Foreign Sand " and provided the Japanese contribution to the international Kiss tribute album Kiss My Ass : Classic Kiss <unk> , an orchestral arrangement of the song " Black Diamond " . A compilation with orchestral treatments of X Japan songs , titled Eternal Melody was also released . It was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and among others featured The Beatles producer George Martin as an arranger . 
 Since 1998 Yoshiki has engaged in numerous activities , such as briefly being a member of the pop band Globe , producing singles for the Korean rock band TRAX and numerous others , as well as working on his solo project Violet UK , which has yet to publish a major release . He has also contributed music to the movie Catacombs and produced the soundtrack of Repo ! The Genetic Opera . On May 25 , 2007 , the formation of the supergroup <unk> was announced , which besides Yoshiki consists of pop / rock artists Gackt and <unk> , as well as Luna Sea guitarist Sugizo . The band gave its first and only performance at the Anime Expo convention in Long Beach , California on June 29 , 2007 . 
 = = = 2007 – 08 : Reunion = = = 
 According to a report by the newspaper <unk> , Toshi visited Yoshiki in Los Angeles in November 2006 to work on the song " Without You " as a tribute to hide . On March 21 , 2007 , Toshi announced on his website that he and Yoshiki had recently resumed working together , stating that a " new project " would commence soon . Rumors of an X Japan reunion subsequently began , and in June Yoshiki was reported as having expressed interest in a tour ( beginning in Los Angeles ) , " Without You " being released as a single , and that he was in talks with Heath and Pata regarding their participation . 
 The band made its first public appearance on October 22 , 2007 , on the rooftop of the shopping center Aqua City in Odaiba , Tokyo , to film a music video for the newly recorded song " I.V. " . The song was used as the theme of the American horror movie Saw IV . It was written by Yoshiki and recorded with all X Japan members of the pre @-@ breakup lineup , as it utilizes previously unreleased guitar tracks by hide . " I.V. " was released through iTunes on January 23 , 2008 , topping the store 's charts on that day . 
 On January 20 , 2008 , two Tokyo Dome concert dates were announced for March 28 and March 30 . Due to popular demand , they added another concert for the 29th . These three shows were entitled Resume Attack 2008 I.V. – Towards Destruction , with each individual concert titled Night of Destruction , Night of Madness and Night of Creation , respectively , and featured three guest guitarists filling in for the late hide – Wes Borland , Richard Fortus and Sugizo . The March 28 concert was aired live on the pay @-@ per @-@ view channel WOWOW . During the song " Art of Life " a hologram of hide ( taken from footage of the " Art of Life " performance at the Tokyo Dome in 1993 ) played alongside the band . Because of technical difficulties , possibly due to the hologram , the first concert was delayed for over two hours and later came to an abrupt end when drummer Yoshiki collapsed eight songs into the performance . The subsequent shows were without such difficulties and during a press conference , plans for a concert in Paris , France on July 5 , 2008 , were announced , with an intended audience of 20 @,@ 000 people . In addition to the Paris date , plans for concerts at the Madison Square Garden in New York City on September 13 , and at the Taipei World Trade Center in Taipei on August 2 were also announced .

 The hide memorial summit took place on May 3 and 4 , 2008 at <unk> Stadium , with X Japan performing the second day , as a tribute to the musician who was also a former X guitarist . Numerous other popular acts such as <unk> , Oblivion Dust and Versailles also performed , with Phantasmagoria and Luna Sea even reuniting for one day . Organizers planned for an estimated 100 @,@ 000 fans to attend the two shows . On June 8 , it was reported that all of X Japan 's previously scheduled shows would be postponed until further notice , due to a recurrence of Yoshiki 's disc herniation . The Paris and Taipei concerts were re @-@ scheduled , Paris for November 22 , 2009 . 
 On September 15 , 2008 , Yoshiki held a press conference in Tokyo , where he announced a new , unnamed X Japan song was in the works . Concerts at Saitama Super Arena on Christmas and New Year 's Eve 2008 were also announced . After the conference Yoshiki went on a promotional tour across Asia . On November 7 , the French ticketing website <unk> announced that the planned ticket sale for the show in Paris would be canceled . Later that day , X Japan released a press statement through their French language website apologizing for the second postponement and announced that the planned Christmas shows would likely suffer a similar fate . On December 31 , X Japan performed their New Year 's Eve countdown performance at the Akasaka Blitz . 
 On January 15 , 2009 , the band arrived in Hong Kong for their January 16 and 17 shows . On May 1 , it was announced that Sugizo officially joined X Japan as lead guitarist . Their first show with him as a full member was held the next day at the Tokyo Dome , where they played " Jade " for the first time . The Taiwan concert that was postponed for a second time in January , was finally held on May 30 , 2009 . 
 On January 9 , 2010 , the band made its first public U.S. appearance by shooting four new music videos in Hollywood . The four videos were for " Rusty Nail " , " Endless Rain " , " I.V. " , and their new song " Jade " . In February , Yoshiki confirmed that X Japan will be performing at Lollapalooza in August . Later that month , he announced at a press event that the band would be relocating to Los Angeles , California , with a concert being planned for a " simple " venue in the city area to mark the band 's first official North American show . It was also announced that a sixth album was in the works and was expected to be released in the fall . 
 In March 2010 , Yoshiki filed a lawsuit against Nexstar Corporation , for 375 million yen in damages . The claim states that after X Japan reunited , they entered a contract with Nexstar Corporation in January 2008 , which included the use of some recordings . That initial deal was for 600 million yen in advance royalties and contract money , which has been entirely unpaid . Between 2008 and 2009 , the company also sponsored ten of the band 's concerts in Japan and other parts of Asia . About 320 million yen in performance fees and merchandise sales from those concerts is due to the band as well . In all , the total unpaid amount is more than 900 million yen . The lawsuit is currently seeking only 375 million yen for the revenue earned from the concerts , but should the case go to trial , Yoshiki 's side plans to file an additional claim for the 600 million yen in the initial contract . 
 On July 1 , the band appeared at Club Nokia in Los Angeles where they performed an acoustic setlist , and recorded a music video for the new song , " Born to Be Free " . On July 4 , the two founding members Toshi and Yoshiki , appeared in Paris at the Japan Expo 2010 where they performed some songs . During the following month , X Japan and Yoshiki were featured in numerous newspapers and websites such as ABC News , the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Sun @-@ Times . X Japan performed at Lollapalooza 2010 in Grant Park , Chicago on August 8 . In the following days , Yoshiki did a Q & A article with the Phoenix New Times and was interviewed by ABC News . 
 On August 14 and 15 , 2010 , the band performed a two @-@ day show at Nissan Stadium , the largest stadium in Japan . Some media reported an estimated attendance of 140 @,@ 000 for the two concerts . Ex @-@ bassist Taiji joined them on stage both nights as a guest for the song " X " , he would die the following year . Soon after , former deceased guitarist hide 's management company , <unk> Organization , filed a lawsuit against Yoshiki and X Japan 's management , Japan Music Agency , for using images of the former member without a formal agreement in place . The claim states that in 2000 the two companies signed an agreement allowing Yoshiki and X Japan to use visual images of hide during concerts . However , images were used at these Nissan Stadium shows , when apparently the contract was expired . 
 From September 25 to October 10 , X Japan performed their first ever North American tour with dates in Los Angeles , Oakland , Seattle , Chicago , Vancouver , Toronto and New York City . On December 17 , Yoshiki announced that a new X Japan song , " Scarlet Love Song " , was composed for the animated movie adaptation of the Buddha manga .

X Japan performed on March 6 at Asia Girls Explosion , a fashion event and music concert that Yoshiki created with Jay FR . It was announced they would perform in Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Mexico and Peru later in the year . 
 Due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan on March 11 , the band decided to postpone the release of " Jade " until June 28 . Yoshiki also decided to auction off one of his used signature Kawai crystal grand pianos , of which all proceeds were sent to help provide aid to the victims of the earthquake and tsunami . 
 " Scarlet Love Song " was released in Japan on June 8 , and on June 28 their first worldwide single , " Jade " , was released , both on iTunes .

On February 3 , X Japan announced the postponement of their album release and March 12 , 2016 concert at the Wembley Arena for a whole year , currently scheduled for March 4 , 2017 . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 X Japan 's music developed in the wake of American and British glam and heavy metal music , and is characterized by driving speed / power metal compositions with symphonic elements ( e.g. " Kurenai " , " Silent Jealousy " ) and emotional ballads ( e.g. " Endless Rain " , " Forever Love " ) . Many of the group 's songs make use of orchestrated passages , particularly on longer tracks such as the ten and a half minute " Tears " , " Crucify My Love " , and the twenty @-@ nine @-@ minute " Art of Life " . The majority of the band 's lyrics are in Japanese , the band 's native language , however many instances show the lyrics alternating from Japanese to English and back . Examples of this include the spoken @-@ word background vocals during the bridge of " Rusty Nail " , and multiple lines ( including the entire pre @-@ chorus ) of the song " Week End " . The first recorded version of " Kurenai " from Vanishing Vision contains lyrics entirely in English . 
 The majority of the band 's catalog of music was written by Yoshiki with relatively little composition from the other <unk> hide contributed several songs , including the single " Scars " , while Pata 's only claim is " White Wind from Mr. Martin ~ Pata 's Nap ~ " . Toshi 's contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs . Taiji contributed music to a couple of songs , notably " Voiceless Screaming " from the album Jealousy , for which , when performed live , he played the acoustic guitar . Heath 's only writing credit is the instrumental song " <unk> " on the 1996 album Dahlia , which he wrote with Pata . Only one song is credited as a full band collaboration , " Easy Fight Rambling " on the 1989 album Blue Blood . Of songs from the band 's lesser @-@ known former members , only the track " Time Trip Loving " from the single " Orgasm " , composed by Jun with Toshi writing the lyrics , was officially released . In 2010 it was reported that Sugizo had written some songs , though no further information has been given since . That year , Yoshiki claimed that their new material was " pretty much the same thing , maybe a little edgier . " However , in 2014 he specifically stated it will not be the same as before , adding that it will be very heavy , melodic , and " more contemporary . " 
 Yoshiki 's songwriting process is unusual in that he writes scores for everything , including guitar and drums , before beginning to play it with the band . Although changes are made if necessary . His composing style tends to make use of chords in sequences of eights or more with riff @-@ based motifs or call @-@ and @-@ response style phrasing . He has maintained this style for the majority of his career as a composer . Having played classical piano since he was four years old , Yoshiki claims to be as influenced by classical music as he is by rock . While also serving as the main songwriter Yoshiki has production credit on much of X Japan 's later material . During live performances the band relies , for the most part , on its members ( with drummer and pianist Yoshiki and guitarist and violinist Sugizo switching between their instruments ) and prerecorded tracks for orchestrated strings , spoken word passages , and more recently , some of hide 's guitar parts . 
 = = Legacy and influence = = 
 X Japan are considered one of the founders of visual kei , a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam , with the name itself believed to have been derived from their slogan " Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock " . In 2011 , Yoshiki briefly described their early years and the movement 's development , saying " when we started the band , the problem was we didn ’ t belong anywhere . Because we were playing very heavy music , we were wearing tons of make @-@ up and crazy outfits . So we couldn ’ t belong anywhere " , " [ We did our own thing and ] that eventually became visual kei . " He added " But visual kei is more like a spirit , it ’ s not a music style or , you know ... I think it is a freedom about describing myself , a freedom to express myself , that ’ s what I believe visual kei is . " Upon former guitarist hide 's death in 1998 , less than a year after the band broke up , Billboard 's Steve McClure declared it " the end of an era " , explaining " X were the first generation of visual kei bands [ ... ] For the next generation of bands , it 's like : That 's it . The torch has been passed to us . " 
 Many bands and artists , most related to visual kei , count them as an influence or look up to them , including <unk> , Dir en grey , Syu of <unk> , The Gazette , Tōru Kawauchi from <unk> , Maya of <unk> , Flow , Yuuki from <unk> , DJ Ozma , Kei of Dio – Distraught Overlord , <unk> from Deadman , Screw 's Jin , and <unk> . The members of Versailles named X and Luna Sea as influences , with singer <unk> saying " I think there isn 't anyone in the Japanese music business who hasn 't been influenced by them . " Likewise , Leda of <unk> and <unk> claims he was not even interested in music until a friend played him X Japan and Luna Sea , and also declared X Japan 's music his " Bible " . American musician Marty Friedman called X Japan the biggest band in visual kei and " by far the most versatile musically , " and cited them as the reason he got into Japanese rock music . 
 The band was popular among rebellious youths , who were attracted to , as Asiaweek put it , " the tone of alienation and frustration for which X was revered . " Their music was described by Asiaweek as having " an angry sound that rejected the cookie @-@ cutter principles of Japanese society . " In 1998 , Radio and TV host Bryan Burton @-@ Lewis explained " In Japan , the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase . They put their life into being X fans : they dress like it , they breathe it . " In the documentary Global Metal , Yoshiki stated that the music industry and media hated the band and would not even interview them , " but eventually we sold 20 million albums , so they had no choice . " 
 X have also been named one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent record label . In 1990 , they won the " Grand Prix New Artist of the Year " award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards . HMV Japan ranked the band number 40 on a 2003 list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts , and in 2010 they came in third in a poll by Oricon on which Japanese bands people want around for future generations . In 2010 , Consequence of Sound named X Japan one of their Top 15 Cult Acts . In April 2012 , X Japan won the Revolver Golden Gods Award for " Best International Artist " . They were awarded " Most Devoted Fans " in the 2012 Loudwire Music Awards on January 17 , 2013 , and won the poll again two years later on February 3 , 2015 . 
 However , X Japan have also made a mark outside of the music industry . In 1999 , at the request of the Japanese government , Yoshiki composed and performed a classical song for Japan 's Emperor Akihito at a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of his enthronement . Japan 's former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is a well @-@ known fan of the band . His political party , the Liberal Democratic Party , even used X 's song " Forever Love " in several commercials in 2001 . It was also reported that Koizumi was influential in getting the hide Museum opened in Yokosuka in 2000 .

 The Neosho @-@ class monitors were a pair of ironclad river monitors laid down in the summer of 1862 . After completion in mid @-@ 1863 , both ships spent time patrolling the Mississippi River against Confederate raids and ambushes as part of Rear Admiral David Porter 's Mississippi Squadron . Both ships participated in the Red River Campaign in March – May 1864 , although Osage supported the capture of Fort DeRussy in March and participated in the Battle of Blair 's Landing in April . Osage was grounded on a sandbar for six months after the end of the campaign while Neosho resumed her patrols on the Mississippi . The latter ship supported the Union Army 's operations on the Cumberland River and provided fire support during the Battle of Nashville in December . 
 Osage , after being refloated and repaired , was transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in early 1865 for the campaign against Mobile , Alabama . During the Battle of Spanish Fort in March 1865 she struck a mine and rapidly sank . The ship was later salvaged and sold in 1867 . Neosho was decommissioned after the war and remained in reserve until sold in 1873 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The original plans for the Neosho @-@ class ships , designed by James Eads , resembled the City @-@ class ironclads with a draft of 5 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) , but the successful performance of the Monitor during the Battle of Hampton Roads caused the navy to revise its requirement to include a gun turret . Eads responded with an impressive design that included a turret with 8 inches ( 203 mm ) of armor , a fully armored sternwheel and a draft of 4 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) , but the navy wanted even less draft and rejected his design . Eads adopted a turtleback deck design that promised to only draw 3 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) . 
 The steam @-@ powered turret was at the bow and they had a deckhouse between the funnel and the sternwheel , although another was later added between the turret and the funnel . The Neosho @-@ class ships were 180 feet ( 54 @.@ 9 m ) long overall and had a beam of 45 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 m ) . When launched , they proved to have a draft 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) deeper than planned and they measured 523 tons burthen . The ships had four steam boilers powering one two @-@ cylinder , western steamboat @-@ type engine that drove the sternwheel . The Neosho @-@ class ships had a maximum speed of 12 miles per hour ( 19 km / h ) in service and they carried 50 long tons ( 51 t ) of coal . 
 The ships ' main armament consisted of two smoothbore 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in a single turret that had an arc of fire of 300 ° . Firing the guns tended to jam the turret until modifications were made to the guns ' recoil system . Each gun weighed approximately 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) . They could fire a 136 @-@ pound ( 61 @.@ 7 kg ) shell up to a range of 3 @,@ 650 yards ( 3 @,@ 340 m ) at an elevation of 15 ° . The turret and the pilothouse were protected by 6 inches ( 152 mm ) of wrought iron while the hull had 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) of armor . The deck 's armor plates were 1 @.@ 25 inches ( 32 mm ) thick .

 Neosho was commissioned at Cairo , Illinois on 13 May 1863 , but was not completed until 1 July . She left Cairo on 14 July 1863 and reached Vicksburg on 6 August , just over a month after it had surrendered after a lengthy siege . Neosho and other warships patrolled the Mississippi and its tributaries to prevent Confederate raiders and flying batteries from ambushing Union supply ships . One example was on 8 December 1863 when " a Confederate shore battery attacked and disabled merchant steamer Henry Von Phul ; Neosho and Signal steamed up to defend the ship and silenced the battery . " 
 From 12 March to 22 May 1864 , Neosho and Osage participated in the unsuccessful Red River Campaign under the command of Rear Admiral David Porter . During the retreat down the Red River , Neosho was trapped above the falls at Alexandria , Louisiana , along with most of the other ironclads of the Mississippi Squadron , when the river 's water level unexpectedly began to fall . Two temporary dams , known as Bailey 's Dam , had to be built in April – May to raise the water level high enough to allow the ironclads to proceed downstream . During the Franklin @-@ Nashville Campaign in December 1864 Neosho , accompanied by the casemate ironclad Carondelet , bombarded Confederate artillery batteries on the Cumberland River , near Bell 's Mills , Tennessee , on 6 December . Despite being hit over 100 times , she was not seriously damaged . The monitor bombarded the Confederate right wing during the Battle of Nashville on 15 – 16 December . 
 Neosho was decommissioned at Mound City , Illinois on 23 July 1865 and remained in ordinary . She was renamed Vixen 15 June 1869 and again renamed Osceola on 2 August 1869 . The monitor was sold at Mound City to David Campbell 17 August 1873 for $ 13 @,@ 600 . 
 During the Red River Campaign Osage was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas O. Selfridge , Jr . She participated in the capture of Fort DeRussy on 14 March 1864 , shortly after the beginning of the campaign . She successfully defended the navy transports attacked during the Battle of Blair 's Landing on 12 April , driving off the Confederate forces with heavy losses . After the end of the campaign in May she was assigned to patrol the Mississippi River . During that month she grounded on a sandbar near Helena , Arkansas and could not be refloated even when some of her armor was removed due to the rapidly falling water level . As the water receded Osage began to hog at the ends because only her middle was supported by the sand . This caused her longitudinal bulkheads to split and broke many rivets in her hull and on her deck . She was repaired in place before being refloated at the end of November . 
 After being towed to Mound City for more permanent repairs , Osage was transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron on 1 February 1865 for the attack on Mobile , Alabama . She participated in the Battle of Spanish Fort , defending Mobile from the east , but struck a mine in a previously swept channel and sank rapidly on 29 March . Two crewmen were killed and some others wounded . The ship was later refloated and sold at auction at New Orleans 22 November 1867 , along with three ex @-@ Confederate ships , for $ 20 @,@ 467 .

 = George Bernard Shaw = 
 George Bernard Shaw ( 26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950 ) , known at his insistence simply as Bernard Shaw , was an Irish playwright , critic and polemicist whose influence on Western theatre , culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond . He wrote more than sixty plays , including major works such as Man and Superman ( 1902 ) , Pygmalion ( 1912 ) and Saint Joan ( 1923 ) . With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory , Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation , and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature . 
 Born in Dublin , Shaw moved to London in 1876 , where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist , and embarked on a rigorous process of self @-@ education . By the mid @-@ 1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic . Following a political awakening , he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer . Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success , Arms and the Man in 1894 . Influenced by Henrik Ibsen , he sought to introduce a new realism into English @-@ language drama , using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political , social and religious ideas . By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara , The Doctor 's Dilemma and Caesar and Cleopatra . 
 Shaw 's expressed views were often contentious ; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform , and opposed vaccination and organised religion . He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable , and although not a republican , castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period . These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist ; the inter @-@ war years saw a series of often ambitious plays , which achieved varying degrees of popular success . In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a filmed version of Pygmalion for which he received an Academy Award . His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished ; by the late 1920s he had largely renounced Fabian gradualism and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and left — he expressed admiration for both Mussolini and Stalin . In the final decade of his life he made fewer public statements , but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death , aged ninety @-@ four , having refused all state honours including the Order of Merit in 1946 . 
 Since Shaw 's death scholarly and critical opinion has varied about his works , but he has regularly been rated as second only to Shakespeare among English @-@ language dramatists ; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of playwrights . The word " Shavian " has entered the language as encapsulating Shaw 's ideas and his means of expressing them . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Shaw was born at 3 Upper Synge Street in Portobello , a lower @-@ middle @-@ class part of Dublin . He was the youngest child and only son of George Carr Shaw ( 1814 – 85 ) and Lucinda Elizabeth ( Bessie ) Shaw ( née Gurly ; 1830 – 1913 ) ; his elder siblings were Lucinda ( Lucy ) Frances ( 1853 – 1920 ) and Elinor Agnes ( 1855 – 76 ) . The Shaw family was of English descent and belonged to the dominant Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland ; George Carr Shaw , an ineffectual alcoholic , was among the family 's less successful members . His relatives secured him a sinecure in the civil service , from which he was pensioned off in the early 1850s ; thereafter he worked irregularly as a corn merchant . In 1852 he married Bessie Gurly ; in the view of Shaw 's biographer Michael Holroyd she married to escape a tyrannical great @-@ aunt . If , as Holroyd and others surmise , George 's motives were mercenary , then he was disappointed , as Bessie brought him little of her family 's money . She came to despise her ineffectual and often drunken husband , with whom she shared what their son later described as a life of " shabby @-@ genteel poverty " . 
 By the time of Shaw 's birth his mother had become close to George John Lee , a flamboyant figure well known in Dublin 's musical circles . Shaw retained a lifelong obsession that Lee might have been his biological father ; there is no consensus among Shavian scholars on the likelihood of this . The young Shaw suffered no harshness from his mother , but he later recalled that her indifference and lack of affection hurt him deeply . He found solace in the music that abounded in the house . Lee was a conductor and teacher of singing ; Bessie had a fine mezzo @-@ soprano voice and was much influenced by Lee 's unorthodox method of vocal production . The Shaws ' house was often filled with music , with frequent gatherings of singers and players . 
 In 1862 Lee and the Shaws agreed to share a large house , No. 1 Hatch Street , in a better part of Dublin , and also a country cottage on Dalkey Hill , overlooking Killiney Bay . Shaw , a sensitive boy , found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing , and he was happier at the cottage . Lee 's students often gave him books , which the young Shaw read avidly ; thus , as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works , he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature . 
 Between 1865 and 1871 Shaw attended four schools , all of which he hated . His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education : " Schools and schoolmasters " , he later wrote , were " prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents . " In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents , where he worked hard , and quickly rose to become head cashier . During this period he was known as " George Shaw " ; after 1876 he dropped the " George " and styled himself " Bernard Shaw " . 
 In June 1873 Lee left Dublin for London , and never returned . A fortnight later Bessie followed him ; the two girls joined her . Shaw 's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter 's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up . Left in Dublin with his father , Shaw compensated for the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano . 
 = = = London = = = 
 Early in 1876 Shaw learned from his mother that Agnes was dying of tuberculosis . He resigned from the land agents , and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes 's funeral . He never again lived in Ireland , and did not visit it for twenty @-@ nine years . 
 Initially , Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London . His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington , but he nevertheless needed an income . He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter , and had no thought yet of writing for a living , but Lee found a little work for him , ghost @-@ writing a musical column printed under Lee 's name in a satirical weekly , The Hornet . Lee 's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London . Shaw maintained contact with Lee , who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer . 
 Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs . In the interim he secured a reader 's pass for the British Museum Reading Room ( the forerunner of the British Library ) and spent most weekdays there , reading and writing . His first attempt at drama , begun in 1878 , was a blank @-@ verse satirical piece on a religious theme . It was abandoned unfinished , as was his first try at a novel . His first completed novel , Immaturity ( 1879 ) was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s . He was employed briefly by the Edison Telephone Company in 1879 – 80 , and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion . Nonetheless , when the Edison firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company , Shaw chose not to seek a place in the new organisation . Thereafter he pursued a full @-@ time career as an author . 
 For the next four years Shaw made a negligible income from writing , and was subsidised by his mother . In 1881 , for the sake of economy , and increasingly as a matter of principle , he became a vegetarian . He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox . In rapid succession he wrote two more novels : The Irrational Knot ( 1880 ) and Love Among the Artists ( 1881 ) , but neither found a publisher ; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner . 
 In 1880 Shaw began attending meetings of the <unk> Society , whose objective was to " search for truth in all matters affecting the interests of the human race " . Here he met Sidney Webb , a junior civil servant who , like Shaw , was busy educating himself . Despite difference of style and temperament , the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship . Shaw later reflected : " You knew everything that I didn 't know and I knew everything you didn 't know ... We had everything to learn from one another and brains enough to do it " . 
 Shaw 's next attempt at drama was a one @-@ act playlet in French , Un Petit Drame , written in 1884 but not published in his lifetime . In the same year the critic William Archer suggested a collaboration , with a plot by Archer and dialogue by Shaw . The project foundered , but Shaw returned to the draft as the basis of Widowers ' Houses in 1892 , and the connection with Archer proved of immense value to Shaw 's career . 
 = = = Political awakening : Marxism , socialism , Fabian Society = = = 
 On 5 September 1882 Shaw attended a meeting at the Memorial Hall , Farringdon , addressed by the political economist Henry George . Shaw then read George 's book Progress and Poverty , which awakened his interest in economics . He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation ( SDF ) , where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx , and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital . He was not impressed by the SDF 's founder , H. M. Hyndman , whom he found autocratic , ill @-@ tempered and lacking leadership qualities . Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it — he preferred , he said , to work with his intellectual equals . 
 After reading a tract , Why Are The Many Poor ? , issued by the recently formed Fabian Society , Shaw went to the society 's next advertised meeting , on 16 May 1884 . He became a member in September , and before the year 's end had provided the society with its first manifesto , published as Fabian Tract No. 2 . He joined the society 's executive committee in January 1885 , and later that year recruited Webb and also Annie Besant , a fine orator . 
 From 1885 to 1889 Shaw attended the fortnightly meetings of the British Economic Association ; it was , Holroyd observes , " the closest Shaw had ever come to university education . " This experience changed his political ideas ; he moved away from Marxism and became an apostle of gradualism . When in 1886 – 87 the Fabians debated whether to embrace anarchism , as advocated by Charlotte Wilson , Besant and others , Shaw joined the majority in rejecting this approach . After a rally in Trafalgar Square addressed by Besant was violently broken up by the authorities on 13 November 1887 ( " Bloody Sunday " ) , Shaw became convinced of the folly of attempting to challenge police power . Thereafter he largely accepted the principle of " permeation " as advocated by Webb : the notion whereby socialism could best be achieved by infiltration of people and ideas into existing political parties . 
 Throughout the 1880s the Fabian Society remained small , its message of moderation frequently unheard among more strident voices . Its profile was raised in 1889 with the publication of Fabian Essays in Socialism , edited by Shaw who also provided two of the essays . The second of these , " Transition " , details the case for gradualism and permeation , asserting that " the necessity for cautious and gradual change must be obvious to everyone " . In 1890 Shaw produced Tract No. 13 , What Socialism Is , a revision of an earlier tract in which Charlotte Wilson had defined socialism in anarchistic terms . In Shaw 's new version , readers were assured that " socialism can be brought about in a perfectly constitutional manner by democratic institutions " . 
 = = = Novelist and critic = = = 
 The mid 1880s marked a turning point in Shaw 's life , both personally and professionally : he lost his virginity , had two novels published , and began a career as a critic . He had been celibate until his twenty @-@ ninth birthday , when his shyness was overcome by Jane ( Jenny ) Patterson , a widow some years his senior . Their affair continued , not always smoothly , for eight years . Shaw 's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers , but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non @-@ platonic romantic liaisons . 
 The published novels , neither commercially successful , were his two final efforts in this genre : Cashel Byron 's Profession written in 1882 – 83 , and An Unsocial Socialist , begun and finished in 1883 . The latter was published as a serial in <unk> magazine in 1884 , although it did not appear in book form until 1887 . Cashel Byron appeared in magazine and book form in 1886 . 
 In 1884 and 1885 , through the influence of Archer , Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers . When Archer resigned as art critic of The World in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw . The two figures in the contemporary art world whose views Shaw most admired were William Morris and John Ruskin , and he sought to follow their precepts in his criticisms . Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw , who rejected the idea of art for art 's sake , and insisted that all great art must be didactic . 
 Of Shaw 's various reviewing activities in the 1880s and 1890s it was as a music critic that he was best known . After serving as deputy in 1888 , he became musical critic of The Star in February 1889 , writing under the pen @-@ name Corno di Bassetto . In May 1890 he moved back to The World , where he wrote a weekly column as " G.B.S. " for more than four years . In the 2016 version of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , Robert Anderson writes , " Shaw 's collected writings on music stand alone in their mastery of English and compulsive readability . " Shaw ceased to be a salaried music critic in August 1894 , but published occasional articles on the subject throughout his career , his last in 1950 . 
 From 1895 to 1898 , Shaw was the theatre critic for The Saturday Review , edited by his friend Frank Harris . As at The World , he used the by @-@ line " G.B.S. " . He campaigned against the artificial conventions and hypocrisies of the Victorian theatre and called for plays of real ideas and true characters . By this time he had embarked in earnest on a career as a playwright : " I had rashly taken up the case ; and rather than let it collapse I manufactured the evidence " . 
 = = = Playwright and politician : 1890s = = = 
 After using the plot of the aborted 1884 collaboration with Archer to complete Widowers ' Houses ( it was staged twice in London , in December 1892 ) , Shaw continued writing plays . At first he made slow progress ; The Philanderer , written in 1893 but not published until 1898 , had to wait until 1905 for a stage production . Similarly , Mrs Warren 's Profession ( 1893 ) was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage . 
 Shaw 's first box @-@ office success was Arms and the Man ( 1894 ) , a mock @-@ Ruritanian comedy satirising conventions of love , military honour and class . The press found the play overlong , and accused Shaw of mediocrity , sneering at heroism and patriotism , heartless cleverness , and copying W. S. Gilbert 's style . The public took a different view , and the management of the theatre staged extra matinée performances to meet the demand . The play ran from April to July , toured the provinces and was staged in New York . Among the cast of the London production was Florence Farr , with whom Shaw had a romantic relationship between 1890 and 1894 , much resented by Jenny Patterson . 
 The success of Arms and the Man was not immediately replicated . Candida , which presented a young woman making a conventional romantic choice for unconventional reasons , received a single performance in South Shields in 1895 ; in 1897 a playlet about Napoleon called The Man of Destiny had a single staging at Croydon . In the 1890s Shaw 's plays were better known in print than on the West End stage ; his biggest success of the decade was in New York in 1897 , when Richard Mansfield 's production of the historical melodrama The Devil 's Disciple earned the author more than £ 2 @,@ 000 in royalties . 
 In January 1893 , as a Fabian delegate , Shaw attended the Bradford conference which led to the foundation of the Independent Labour Party . He was sceptical about the new party , and scorned the likelihood that it could switch the allegiance of the working class from sport to politics . He persuaded the conference to adopt resolutions abolishing indirect taxation , and taxing unearned income " to extinction " . Back in London , Shaw produced what Margaret Cole , in her Fabian history , terms a " grand <unk> " against the minority Liberal administration that had taken power in 1892 . To Your Tents , O Israel excoriated the government for ignoring social issues and concentrating solely on Irish Home Rule , a matter Shaw declared of no relevance to socialism . In 1894 the Fabian Society received a substantial bequest from a sympathiser , Henry Hunt Hutchinson — Holroyd mentions £ 10 @,@ 000 . Webb , who chaired the board of trustees appointed to supervise the legacy , proposed to use most of it to found a school of economics and politics . Shaw demurred ; he thought such a venture was contrary to the specified purpose of the legacy . He was eventually persuaded to support the proposal , and the London School of Economics and Political Science ( LSE ) opened in the summer of 1895 . 
 By the later 1890s Shaw 's political activities lessened as he concentrated on making his name as a dramatist . In 1897 he was persuaded to fill an uncontested vacancy for a " vestryman " ( parish councillor ) in London 's St Pancras district . At least initially , Shaw took to his municipal responsibilities seriously ; when London government was reformed in 1899 and the St Pancras vestry became the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras , he was elected to the newly formed borough council . 
 In 1898 , as a result of overwork , Shaw 's health broke down . He was nursed by Charlotte Payne @-@ Townshend , a rich Anglo @-@ Irish woman whom he had met through the Webbs . The previous year she had proposed that she and Shaw should marry . He had declined , but when she insisted on nursing him in a house in the country , Shaw , concerned that this might cause scandal , agreed to their marriage . The ceremony took place on 1 June 1898 , in the register office in Covent Garden . The bride and bridegroom were both aged forty @-@ one . In the view of the biographer and critic St John Ervine , " their life together was entirely felicitous " . There were no children of the marriage , which it is generally believed was never consummated ; whether this was wholly at Charlotte 's wish , as Shaw liked to suggest , is less widely credited . In the early weeks of the marriage Shaw was much occupied writing his Marxist analysis of Wagner 's Ring cycle , published as The Perfect Wagnerite late in 1898 . In 1906 the Shaws found a country home in Ayot St Lawrence , Hertfordshire ; they renamed the house " Shaw 's Corner " , and lived there for the rest of their lives . They retained a London flat in the Adelphi and later at Whitehall Court . 
 = = = Stage success : 1900 – 14 = = = 
 During the first decade of the twentieth century Shaw secured a firm reputation as a playwright . In 1904 J. E. Vedrenne and Harley Granville @-@ Barker established a company at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square , Chelsea to present modern drama . Over the next five years they staged fourteen of Shaw 's plays . The first , John Bull 's Other Island , a comedy about an Englishman in Ireland , attracted leading politicians and was seen by Edward VII , who laughed so much that he broke his chair . The play was withheld from Dublin 's Abbey Theatre , for fear of the affront it might provoke , although it was shown at the city 's Royal Theatre in November 1907 . Shaw later wrote that William Butler Yeats , who had requested the play , " got rather more than he bargained for ... It was uncongenial to the whole spirit of the neo @-@ Gaelic movement , which is bent on creating a new Ireland after its own ideal , whereas my play is a very uncompromising presentment of the real old Ireland . " Nonetheless , Shaw and Yeats were close friends ; Yeats and Lady Gregory tried unsuccessfully to persuade Shaw to take up the vacant co @-@ directorship of the Abbey Theatre after J. M. Synge 's death in 1909 . Shaw admired other figures in the Irish Literary Revival , including George Russell and James Joyce , and was a close friend of Seán O 'Casey , who was inspired to become a playwright after reading John Bull 's Other Island . 
 Man and Superman , completed in 1902 , was a success both at the Royal Court in 1905 and in Robert Loraine 's New York production in the same year . Among the other Shaw works presented by Vedrenne and Granville @-@ Barker were Major Barbara ( 1905 ) , depicting the contrasting morality of arms manufacturers and the Salvation Army ; The Doctor 's Dilemma ( 1906 ) , a mostly serious piece about professional ethics ; and Caesar and Cleopatra , Shaw 's <unk> to Shakespeare 's Antony and Cleopatra , seen in New York in 1906 and in London the following year . 
 Now prosperous and established , Shaw experimented with unorthodox theatrical forms described by his biographer Stanley Weintraub as " discussion drama " and " serious farce " . These plays included Getting Married ( premiered 1908 ) , The Shewing @-@ Up of Blanco Posnet ( 1909 ) , Misalliance ( 1910 ) , and Fanny 's First Play ( 1911 ) . Blanco Posnet was banned on religious grounds by the Lord Chamberlain ( the official theatre censor in England ) , and was produced instead in Dublin ; it filled the Abbey Theatre to capacity . Fanny 's First Play , a comedy about suffragettes , had the longest initial run of any Shaw play — 622 performances . 
 Androcles and the Lion ( 1912 ) , a less heretical study of true and false religious attitudes than Blanco Posnet , ran for eight weeks in September and October 1913 . It was followed by one of Shaw 's most successful plays , Pygmalion , written in 1912 and staged in Vienna the following year , and in Berlin shortly afterwards . Shaw commented , " It is the custom of the English press when a play of mine is produced , to inform the world that it is not a play — that it is dull , blasphemous , unpopular , and financially unsuccessful . ... Hence arose an urgent demand on the part of the managers of Vienna and Berlin that I should have my plays performed by them first . " The British production opened in April 1914 , starring Sir Herbert Tree and Mrs Patrick Campbell as , respectively , a professor of phonetics and a cockney flower @-@ girl . There had earlier been a romantic liaison between Shaw and Campbell that caused Charlotte Shaw considerable concern , but by the time of the London premiere it had ended . The play attracted capacity audiences until July , when Tree insisted on going on holiday , and the production closed . His co @-@ star then toured in the piece in the US . 
 = = = Fabian years : 1900 – 13 = = = 
 In 1899 , when the Boer War began , Shaw wished the Fabians to take a neutral stance on what he deemed , like Home Rule , to be a " non @-@ Socialist " issue . Others , including the future Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald , wanted unequivocal opposition , and resigned from the society when it followed Shaw . In the Fabians ' war manifesto , Fabianism and the Empire ( 1900 ) , Shaw declared that " until the Federation of the World becomes an accomplished fact we must accept the most responsible Imperial federations available as a substitute for it " . 
 As the new century began , Shaw became increasingly disillusioned by the limited impact of the Fabians on national politics . Thus , although a nominated Fabian delegate , he did not attend the London conference at the Memorial Hall , Farringdon Street in February 1900 , that created the Labour Representation Committee — precursor of the modern Labour Party . By 1903 , when his term as borough councillor expired , he had lost his earlier enthusiasm , writing : " After six years of Borough <unk> I am convinced that the borough councils should be abolished " . Nevertheless , in 1904 he stood in the London County Council elections . After an eccentric campaign , which Holroyd characterises as " [ making ] absolutely certain of not getting in " , he was duly defeated . It was Shaw 's final foray into electoral politics . Nationally , the 1906 general election produced a huge Liberal majority and an intake of 29 Labour members . Shaw viewed this outcome with scepticism ; he had a low opinion of the new prime minister , Sir Henry Campbell @-@ Bannerman , and saw the Labour members as inconsequential : " I apologise to the Universe for my connection with such a body " . 
 In the years after the 1906 election , Shaw felt that the Fabians needed fresh leadership , and saw this in the form of his fellow @-@ writer H. G. Wells , who had joined the society in February 1903 . Wells 's ideas for reform — particularly his proposals for closer cooperation with the Independent Labour Party — placed him at odds with the society 's " Old Gang " , led by Shaw . According to Cole , Wells " had minimal capacity for putting [ his ideas ] across in public meetings against Shaw 's trained and practised virtuosity " . In Shaw 's view , " the Old Gang did not extinguish Mr Wells , he annihilated himself " . Wells resigned from the society in September 1908 ; Shaw remained a member , but left the executive in April 1911 . He later wondered whether the Old Gang should have given way to Wells some years earlier : " God only knows whether the Society had not better have done it " . Although less active — he blamed his advancing years — Shaw remained a Fabian . 
 In 1912 Shaw invested £ 1 @,@ 000 for a one @-@ fifth share in the Webbs ' new publishing venture , a socialist weekly magazine called The New Statesman , which appeared in April 1913 . He became a founding director , publicist , and in due course a contributor , mostly anonymously . He was soon at odds with the magazine 's editor , Clifford Sharp , who by 1916 was rejecting his contributions — " the only paper in the world that refuses to print anything by me " , according to Shaw . 
 = = = First World War = = = 
 After the First World War began in August 1914 , Shaw produced his tract Common Sense About the War , which argued that the warring nations were equally culpable . Such a view was anathema in an atmosphere of fervent patriotism , and offended many of Shaw 's friends ; Ervine records that " [ h ] is appearance at any public function caused the instant departure of many of those present . " 
 Despite his errant reputation , Shaw 's propagandist skills were recognised by the British authorities , and early in 1917 he was invited by Field Marshal Haig to visit the Western Front battlefields . Shaw 's 10 @,@ 000 @-@ word report , which emphasised the human aspects of the soldier 's life , was well received , and he became less of a lone voice . In April 1917 he joined the national consensus in welcoming America 's entry into the war : " a first class moral asset to the common cause against <unk> " . 
 Three short plays by Shaw were premiered during the war . The Inca of Perusalem , written in 1915 , encountered problems with the censor for burlesquing not only the enemy but the British military command ; it was performed in 1916 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre . O 'Flaherty V.C. , satirising the government 's attitude to Irish recruits , was banned in the UK and was presented at a Royal Flying Corps base in Belgium in 1917 . Augustus Does His Bit , a genial farce , was granted a licence ; it opened at the Royal Court in January 1917 . 
 = = = Ireland = = = 
 Shaw had long supported the principle of Irish Home Rule within the British Empire ( which he thought should become the British Commonwealth ) . He did not support separatism , believing that ties with England were essential . In April 1916 he wrote scathingly in The New York Times about militant Irish nationalism : " In point of learning nothing and forgetting nothing these fellow @-@ patriots of mine leave the Bourbons nowhere . " Total independence , he asserted , was impractical ; alliance with a bigger power ( preferably England ) was essential . The Dublin Easter Rising later that month took him by surprise . After its suppression by British forces , he expressed horror at the summary execution of the rebel leaders , but continued to believe in some form of Anglo @-@ Irish union . In How to Settle the Irish Question ( 1917 ) , he envisaged a federal arrangement , with national and imperial parliaments . Holroyd records that by this time the separatist party Sinn Féin was in the ascendency , and Shaw 's and other moderate schemes were forgotten . 
 In the postwar period , Shaw despaired of the British government 's coercive policies towards Ireland , and joined his fellow @-@ writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton in publicly condemning these actions . The Anglo @-@ Irish Treaty of December 1921 led to the partition of Ireland between north and south , a provision that dismayed Shaw . In 1922 civil war broke out in the south between its pro @-@ treaty and anti @-@ treaty factions , the former of whom had established the Irish Free State . Shaw visited Dublin in August , and met Michael Collins , then head of the Free State 's Provisional Government . Shaw was much impressed by Collins , and was saddened when , three days later , he was ambushed and killed by anti @-@ treaty forces . In a letter to Collins 's sister , Shaw wrote : " I met Michael for the first and last time on Saturday last , and am very glad I did . I rejoice in his memory , and will not be so disloyal to it as to <unk> over his valiant death " . Shaw remained a British subject all his life , but took dual nationality in 1934 . 
 = = = 1920s = = = 
 Shaw 's first major work to appear after the war was Heartbreak House , written in 1916 – 17 and performed in 1920 . It was produced on Broadway in November , and was coolly received : " Mr Shaw on this occasion has more than usual to say and takes twice as long as usual to say it " . After the London premiere in October 1921 The Times concurred with the American critics : " As usual with Mr Shaw , the play is about an hour too long " , although containing " much entertainment and some profitable reflection " . Ervine in The Observer thought the play brilliant but ponderously acted , except for Edith Evans as Lady <unk> . 
 Shaw 's largest @-@ scale theatrical work was Back to Methuselah , written in 1918 – 20 and staged in 1922 . Weintraub describes it as " Shaw 's attempt to fend off ' the bottomless pit of an utterly discouraging pessimism ' " . This cycle of five interrelated plays depicts evolution , and the effects of longevity , from the Garden of Eden to the year 31 @,@ 920 AD . Critics found the five plays strikingly uneven in quality and invention . The original run was brief , and the work has been revived infrequently . Shaw felt he had exhausted his remaining creative powers in the huge span of this " <unk> Pentateuch " . He was now sixty @-@ seven , and expected to write no more plays . 
 This mood was short @-@ lived . In 1920 Joan of Arc was proclaimed a saint by Pope Benedict XV ; Shaw had long found Joan an interesting historical character , and his view of her veered between " half @-@ witted genius " and someone of " exceptional sanity " . He had considered writing a play about her in 1913 , and the canonisation prompted him to return to the subject . He wrote Saint Joan in the middle months of 1923 , and the play was premiered on Broadway in December . It was enthusiastically received there , and at its London premiere the following March . In Weintraub 's phrase , " even the Nobel prize committee could no longer ignore Shaw after Saint Joan " . The citation for the literature prize for 1925 praised his work as " ... marked by both idealism and humanity , its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty " . He accepted the award , but rejected the monetary prize that went with it , on the grounds that " My readers and my audiences provide me with more than sufficient money for my needs " . 
 After Saint Joan , it was five years before Shaw wrote a play . From 1924 , Shaw spent four years writing what he described as his " magnum opus " , a political treatise entitled The Intelligent Woman 's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism . The book was published in 1928 and sold well . At the end of the decade Shaw produced his final Fabian tract , a commentary on the League of Nations . He described the League as " a school for the new international statesmanship as against the old Foreign Office diplomacy " , but thought that it had not yet become the " Federation of the World " . 
 Shaw returned to the theatre with what he called " a political extravaganza " , The Apple Cart , written in late 1928 . It was , in Ervine 's view , unexpectedly popular , taking a conservative , monarchist , anti @-@ democratic line that appealed to contemporary audiences . The premiere was in Warsaw in June 1928 , and the first British production was two months later , at Sir Barry Jackson 's inaugural Malvern Festival . The other eminent creative artist most closely associated with the festival was Sir Edward Elgar , with whom Shaw enjoyed a deep friendship and mutual regard . He described The Apple Cart to Elgar as " a scandalous Aristophanic burlesque of democratic politics , with a brief but shocking sex interlude " . 
 During the 1920s Shaw began to lose faith in the idea that society could be changed through Fabian gradualism , and became increasingly fascinated with dictatorial methods . In 1922 he had welcomed Mussolini 's accession to power in Italy , observing that amid the " indiscipline and muddle and Parliamentary deadlock " , Mussolini was " the right kind of tyrant " . Shaw was prepared to tolerate certain dictatorial excesses ; Weintraub in his ODNB biographical sketch comments that Shaw 's " flirtation with authoritarian inter @-@ war regimes " took a long time to fade , and Beatrice Webb thought he was " obsessed " about Mussolini . 
 = = = 1930s = = = 
 Shaw 's enthusiasm for the Soviet Union dated to the early 1920s when he had hailed Lenin as " the one really interesting statesman in Europe " . Having turned down several chances to visit , in 1931 he joined a party led by Nancy Astor . The carefully managed trip culminated in a lengthy meeting with Stalin , whom Shaw later described as " a Georgian gentleman " with no malice in him . At a dinner given in his honour , Shaw told the gathering : " I have seen all the ' terrors ' and I was terribly pleased by them " . In March 1933 Shaw was a co @-@ signatory to a letter in The Manchester Guardian protesting at the continuing misrepresentation of Soviet achievements : " No lie is too fantastic , no slander is too stale ... for employment by the more reckless elements of the British press . " 
 Shaw 's admiration for Mussolini and Stalin demonstrated his growing belief that dictatorship was the only viable political arrangement . When the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in January 1933 , Shaw described Hitler as " a very remarkable man , a very able man " , and professed himself proud to be the only writer in England who was " scrupulously polite and just to Hitler " . His principal admiration was for Stalin , whose regime he championed uncritically throughout the decade . Shaw saw the 1939 Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact as a triumph for Stalin who , he said , now had Hitler under his thumb . 
 Shaw 's first play of the decade was Too True to be Good , written in 1931 and premiered in Boston in February 1932 . The reception was unenthusiastic . Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times commenting that Shaw had " yielded to the impulse to write without having a subject " , judged the play a " rambling and indifferently tedious conversation " . The correspondent of The New York Herald Tribune said that most of the play was " discourse , unbelievably long lectures " and that although the audience enjoyed the play it was bewildered by it . 
 During the decade Shaw travelled widely and frequently . Most of his journeys were with Charlotte ; she enjoyed voyages on ocean liners , and he found peace to write during the long spells at sea . Shaw met an enthusiastic welcome in South Africa in 1932 , despite his strong remarks about the racial divisions of the country . In December 1932 the couple embarked on a round @-@ the @-@ world cruise . In March 1933 they arrived at San Francisco , to begin Shaw 's first visit to the US . He had earlier refused to go to " that awful country , that uncivilized place " , " unfit to govern itself ... illiberal , superstitious , crude , violent , anarchic and arbitrary " . He visited Hollywood , with which he was unimpressed , and New York , where he lectured to a capacity audience in the Metropolitan Opera House . Harried by the intrusive attentions of the press , Shaw was glad when his ship sailed from New York harbour . New Zealand , which he and Charlotte visited the following year , struck him as " the best country I 've been in " ; he urged its people to be more confident and loosen their dependence on trade with Britain . He used the weeks at sea to complete two plays — The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles and The Six of Calais — and begin work on a third , The Millionairess . 
 Despite his contempt for Hollywood and its aesthetic values , Shaw was enthusiastic about cinema , and in the middle of the decade wrote screenplays for prospective film versions of Pygmalion and Saint Joan . The latter was never made , but Shaw entrusted the rights to the former to the unknown Gabriel Pascal , who produced it at Pinewood Studios in 1938 . Shaw was determined that Hollywood should have nothing to do with the film , but was powerless to prevent it from winning two Academy Awards ( " Oscars " ) ; he described his award for " best @-@ written screenplay " as an insult , coming from such a source . He became , and at 2016 remains , the only person to have been awarded a Nobel Prize and an Oscar . In a 1993 study of the Oscars , Anthony Holden observes that Pygmalion was soon spoken of as having " lifted movie @-@ making from illiteracy to literacy " . 
 Shaw 's final plays of the 1930s were Cymbeline Refinished ( 1936 ) , Geneva ( 1936 ) and In Good King Charles 's Golden Days ( 1939 ) . The first , a fantasy reworking of Shakespeare , made little impression , but the second , a satire on European dictators , attracted more notice , much of it unfavourable . In particular , Shaw 's parody of Hitler as " Herr Battler " was considered mild , almost sympathetic . The third play , an historical conversation piece first seen at Malvern , ran briefly in London in May 1940 . James Agate commented that the play contained nothing to which even the most conservative audiences could take exception , and though it was long and lacking in dramatic action only " witless and idle " theatregoers would object . After their first runs none of the three plays were seen again in the West End during Shaw 's lifetime . 
 Towards the end of the decade , both Shaws began to suffer ill health . Charlotte was increasingly incapacitated by Paget 's disease of bone , and he developed pernicious anaemia . His treatment , involving injections of concentrated animal liver , was successful , but this breach of his vegetarian creed distressed him and brought down condemnation from militant vegetarians . 
 = = = Second World War and final years = = = 
 Although Shaw 's works since The Apple Cart had been received without great enthusiasm , his earlier plays were revived in the West End throughout the Second World War , starring such actors as Edith Evans , John Gielgud , Deborah Kerr and Robert Donat . In 1944 nine Shaw plays were staged in London , including Arms and the Man with Ralph Richardson , Laurence Olivier , Sybil Thorndike and Margaret Leighton in the leading roles . Two touring companies took his plays all round the country . The revival in his popularity did not tempt Shaw to write a new play , and he concentrated on prolific journalism . A second Shaw film produced by Pascal , Major Barbara ( 1941 ) was less successful , artistically and commercially , than Pygmalion , partly because of Pascal 's insistence on directing , to which he was unsuited . 
 Following the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 and the rapid conquest of Poland , Shaw was accused of defeatism when , in a New Statesman article , he declared the war over and demanded a peace conference . Nevertheless , when he became convinced that a negotiated peace was impossible , he publicly urged the neutral United States to join the fight . The London blitz of 1940 – 41 led the Shaws , both in their mid @-@ eighties , to live full @-@ time at Ayot St Lawrence . Even there they were not immune from enemy air raids , and stayed on occasion with Nancy Astor at her country house , Cliveden . In 1943 , the worst of the London bombing over , the Shaws moved back to Whitehall Court , where medical help for Charlotte was more easily arranged . Her condition deteriorated and she died in September . 
 Shaw 's final political treatise , Everybody 's Political What 's What , was published in 1944 . Holroyd describes this as " a rambling narrative ... that repeats ideas he had given better elsewhere and then repeats itself " . The book sold well — 85 @,@ 000 copies by the end of the year . After Hitler 's suicide in May 1945 , Shaw approved of the formal condolences offered by the Irish Taoiseach , Éamon de Valera , at the German embassy in Dublin . Shaw disapproved of the postwar trials of the defeated German leaders , as an act of self @-@ righteousness : " We are all potential criminals " . 
 Pascal was given a third opportunity to film Shaw 's work with Caesar and Cleopatra ( 1945 ) . It cost three times its original budget and was rated " the biggest financial failure in the history of British cinema " . The film was poorly received by British critics , although American reviews were friendlier . Shaw thought its lavishness nullified the drama , and he considered the film " a poor imitation of Cecil B. de Mille " . 
 In 1946 , the year of Shaw 's ninetieth birthday , he accepted the freedom of Dublin and became the first honorary freeman of the borough of St Pancras , London . In the same year the government asked Shaw informally whether he would accept the Order of Merit . He declined , believing that an author 's merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history . 1946 saw the publication , as The Crime of Imprisonment , of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions . It was widely praised ; a reviewer in The American Journal of Public Health considered it essential reading for any student of the American criminal justice system . 
 Shaw continued to write into his nineties . His last plays were Buoyant Billions ( 1947 ) , his final full @-@ length work ; <unk> Fables ( 1948 ) a set of six short plays revisiting several of his earlier themes such as evolution ; a comic play for puppets , Shakes versus Shav ( 1949 ) , a ten @-@ minute piece in which Shakespeare and Shaw trade insults ; and Why She Would Not ( 1950 ) , which Shaw described as " a little comedy " , written in one week shortly before his ninety @-@ fourth birthday . 
 During his later years , Shaw enjoyed tending the gardens at Shaw 's Corner . He died at the age of ninety @-@ four of renal failure precipitated by injuries incurred when falling while pruning a tree . He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 6 November 1950 . His ashes , mixed with those of Charlotte , were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their garden .

 Shaw published a collected edition of his plays in 1934 , comprising forty @-@ two works . He wrote a further twelve in the remaining sixteen years of his life , mostly one @-@ act pieces . Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works , the total is sixty @-@ two . 
 = = = = Early works = = = = 
 Shaw 's first three full @-@ length plays dealt with social issues . He later grouped them as " Plays Unpleasant " . Widower 's Houses ( 1892 ) concerns the landlords of slum properties , and introduces the first of Shaw 's New Women — a recurring feature of later plays . The Philanderer ( 1893 ) develops the theme of the New Woman , draws on Ibsen , and has elements of Shaw 's personal relationships , the character of Julia being based on Jenny Patterson . In a 2003 study Judith Evans describes Mrs Warren 's Profession ( 1893 ) as " undoubtedly the most challenging " of the three Plays Unpleasant , taking Mrs Warren 's profession — prostitute and , later , brothel @-@ owner — as a metaphor for a prostituted society . 
 Shaw followed the first trilogy with a second , published as " Plays Pleasant " . Arms and the Man ( 1894 ) conceals beneath a mock @-@ Ruritanian comic romance a Fabian parable contrasting impractical idealism with pragmatic socialism . The central theme of Candida ( 1894 ) is a woman 's choice between two men ; the play contrasts the outlook and aspirations of a Christian Socialist and a poetic idealist . The third of the Pleasant group , You Never Can Tell ( 1896 ) , portrays social mobility , and the gap between generations , particularly in how they approach social relations in general and mating in particular . 
 The " Three Plays for Puritans " — comprising The Devil 's Disciple ( 1896 ) , Caesar and Cleopatra ( 1898 ) and Captain Brassbound 's Conversion ( 1899 ) — all centre on questions of empire and imperialism , a major topic of political discourse in the 1890s . The three are set , respectively , in 1770s America , Ancient Egypt , and 1890s Morocco . The Gadfly , an adaptation of a popular novel by Ethel Voynich , was unfinished and unperformed . The Man of Destiny ( 1895 ) is a short curtain raiser about Napoleon . 
 = = = = 1900 – 09 = = = = 
 Shaw 's major plays of the first decade of the 20th century address individual social , political or ethical issues . Man and Superman ( 1902 ) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment , giving Shaw 's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text . The Admirable <unk> ( 1901 ) , a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw 's novel Cashel Byron 's Profession , focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa . John Bull 's Other Island ( 1904 ) , comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland , was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years . Major Barbara ( 1905 ) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way , confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter . The Doctor 's Dilemma ( 1906 ) , a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment , was described by Shaw as a tragedy . With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood , he was challenged by Archer to present an on @-@ stage death , and here did so , with a deathbed scene for the anti @-@ hero . 
 Getting Married ( 1908 ) and Misalliance ( 1909 ) — the latter seen by Judith Evans as a companion piece to the former — are both in what Shaw called his " <unk> " vein , with the emphasis on discussion of ideas rather than on dramatic events or vivid characterisation . Shaw wrote seven short plays during the decade ; they are all comedies , ranging from the deliberately absurd Passion , Poison , and <unk> ( 1905 ) to the satirical Press Cuttings ( 1909 ) . 
 = = = = 1910 – 19 = = = = 
 In the decade from 1910 to the aftermath of the First World War Shaw wrote four full @-@ length plays , the third and fourth of which are among his most frequently staged works . Fanny 's First Play ( 1911 ) continues his earlier examinations of middle @-@ class British society from a Fabian viewpoint , with additional touches of melodrama and an epilogue in which theatre critics discuss the play . Androcles and the Lion ( 1912 ) , which Shaw began writing as a play for children , became a study of the nature of religion and how to put Christian precepts into practice . Pygmalion ( 1912 ) is a Shavian study of language and speech and their importance in society and in personal relationships . To correct the impression left by the original performers that the play portrayed a romantic relationship between the two main characters Shaw rewrote the ending to make it clear that the heroine will marry another , minor character . Shaw 's only full @-@ length play from the war years is Heartbreak House ( 1917 ) , which in his words depicts " cultured , leisured Europe before the war " drifting towards disaster . Shaw named Shakespeare ( King Lear ) and Chekhov ( The Cherry Orchard ) as important influences on the piece , and critics have found elements drawing on Congreve ( The Way of the World ) and Ibsen ( The Master Builder ) . 
 The short plays range from genial historical drama in The Dark Lady of the Sonnets and Great Catherine ( 1910 and 1913 ) to a study of polygamy in <unk> ; three satirical works about the war ( The Inca of Perusalem , O 'Flaherty V.C. and Augustus Does His Bit , 1915 – 16 ) ; a piece that Shaw called " utter nonsense " ( The Music Cure , 1914 ) and a brief sketch about a " Bolshevik empress " ( <unk> , 1917 ) . 
 = = = = 1920 – 50 = = = = 
 Saint Joan ( 1923 ) drew widespread praise both for Shaw and for Sybil Thorndike , for whom he wrote the title role and who created the part in Britain . In the view of the commentator Nicholas Grene , Shaw 's Joan , a " no @-@ nonsense mystic , Protestant and nationalist before her time " is among the 20th century 's classic leading female roles . The Apple Cart ( 1929 ) , was Shaw 's last popular success . He gave both that play and its successor , Too True to Be Good ( 1931 ) , the subtitle " A political extravaganza " , although the two works differ greatly in their themes ; the first presents the politics of a nation ( with a brief royal love @-@ scene as an interlude ) and the second , in Judith Evans 's words , " is concerned with the social mores of the individual , and is nebulous . " Shaw 's plays of the 1930s were written in the shadow of worsening national and international political events . Once again , with On the Rocks ( 1933 ) and The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles ( 1934 ) , a political comedy with a clear plot was followed by an introspective drama . The first play portrays a British prime minister considering , but finally rejecting , the establishment of a dictatorship ; the second is concerned with polygamy and eugenics and ends with the Day of Judgement . 
 The Millionairess ( 1934 ) is a farcical depiction of the commercial and social affairs of a successful businesswoman . Geneva ( 1936 ) lampoons the feebleness of the League of Nations compared with the dictators of Europe . In Good King Charles 's Golden Days ( 1939 ) , described by Weintraub as a warm , discursive high comedy , also depicts authoritarianism , but less satirically than Geneva . As in earlier decades , the shorter plays were generally comedies , some historical and others addressing various political and social preoccupations of the author . Ervine writes of Shaw 's later work that although it was still " astonishingly vigorous and vivacious " it showed unmistakable signs of his age . " The best of his work in this period , however , was full of wisdom and the beauty of mind often displayed by old men who keep their wits about them . " 
 = = = Music and drama reviews = = = 
 = = = = Music = = = = 
 Shaw 's collected musical criticism , published in three volumes , runs to more than 2 @,@ 700 pages . It covers the British musical scene from 1876 to 1950 , but the core of the collection dates from his six years as music critic of The Star and The World in the late 1880s and early 1890s . In his view music criticism should be interesting to everyone rather than just the musical élite , and he wrote for the non @-@ specialist , avoiding technical jargon — " Mesopotamian words like ' the dominant of D major ' " . He was fiercely partisan in his columns , promoting the music of Wagner and decrying that of Brahms and those British composers such as Stanford and Parry whom he saw as Brahmsian . He campaigned against the prevailing fashion for performances of Handel oratorios with huge amateur choirs and inflated orchestration , calling for " a chorus of twenty capable artists " . He railed against opera productions unrealistically staged or sung in languages the audience did not speak . 
 = = = = Drama = = = = 
 In Shaw 's view the London theatres of the 1890s presented too many revivals of old plays and not enough new work . He campaigned against " melodrama , sentimentality , stereotypes and worn @-@ out conventions " . As a music critic he had frequently been able to concentrate on analysing new works , but in the theatre he was often obliged to fall back on discussing how various performers tackled well @-@ known plays . In a study of Shaw 's work as a theatre critic , E. J. West writes that Shaw " ceaselessly compared and contrasted artists in interpretation and in technique " . Shaw contributed more than 150 articles as theatre critic for The Saturday Review , in which he assessed more than 212 productions . He championed Ibsen 's plays when many theatregoers regarded them as outrageous , and his 1891 book Quintessence of Ibsenism remained a classic throughout the 20th century . Of contemporary dramatists writing for the West End stage he rated Oscar Wilde above the rest : " ... our only thorough playwright . He plays with everything : with wit , with philosophy , with drama , with actors and audience , with the whole theatre " . Shaw 's collected criticisms were published as Our Theatres in the Nineties in 1932 . 
 Shaw maintained a provocative and frequently self @-@ contradictory attitude to Shakespeare ( whose name he insisted on spelling " Shakespear " ) . Many found him difficult to take seriously on the subject ; Duff Cooper observed that by attacking Shakespeare , " it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain . " Shaw was , nevertheless , a knowledgeable Shakespearian , and in an article in which he wrote , " With the single exception of Homer , there is no eminent writer , not even Sir Walter Scott , whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his , " he also said , " But I am bound to add that I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespear . He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers , and will outlast a thousand more " . Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare : <unk> " <unk> " , and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over @-@ elaborate productions . He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare , and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes : The Dark Lady of the Sonnets , Cymbeline Refinished and Shakes versus Shav . In a 2001 analysis of Shaw 's Shakespearian criticisms , Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw , who was no academic , saw Shakespeare 's plays — like all theatre — from an author 's practical point of view : " Shaw helps us to get away from the Romantics ' picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius , one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss , or with a specific staging and cast of actors . " 
 = = = Political and social writings = = = 
 Shaw 's political and social commentaries were published variously in Fabian tracts , in essays , in two full @-@ length books , in innumerable newspaper and journal articles and in prefaces to his plays . The majority of Shaw 's Fabian tracts were published anonymously , representing the voice of the society rather than of Shaw , although the society 's secretary Edward Pease later confirmed Shaw 's authorship . According to Holroyd , the business of the early Fabians , mainly under the influence of Shaw , was to " alter history by rewriting it " . Shaw 's talent as a pamphleteer was put to immediate use in the production of the society 's manifesto — after which , says Holroyd , he was never again so succinct . 
 After the turn of the 20th century , Shaw increasingly propagated his ideas through the medium of his plays . An early critic , writing in 1904 , observed that Shaw 's dramas provided " a pleasant means " of proselytising his socialism , adding that " Mr Shaw 's views are to be sought especially in the prefaces to his plays " . After loosening his ties with the Fabian movement in 1911 , Shaw 's writings were more personal and often provocative ; his response to the furore following the issue of Common Sense About the War in 1914 , was to prepare a sequel , More Common Sense About the War . In this , he denounced the pacifist line espoused by Ramsay MacDonald and other socialist leaders , and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence . On the advice of Beatrice Webb , this pamphlet remained unpublished . 
 The Intelligent Woman 's Guide , Shaw 's main political treatise of the 1920s , attracted both admiration and criticism . MacDonald considered it the world 's most important book since the Bible ; Harold Laski thought its arguments outdated and lacking in concern for individual freedoms . Shaw 's increasing flirtation with dictatorial methods is evident in many of his subsequent pronouncements . A New York Times report dated 10 December 1933 quoted a recent Fabian Society lecture in which Shaw had praised Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin : " [ T ] hey are trying to get something done , [ and ] are adopting methods by which it is possible to get something done " . As late as the Second World War , in Everybody 's Political What 's What , Shaw blamed the Allies ' " abuse " of their 1918 victory for the rise of Hitler , and hoped that , after defeat , the Führer would escape retribution " to enjoy a comfortable retirement in Ireland or some other neutral country " . These sentiments , according to the Irish philosopher @-@ poet Thomas Duddy , " rendered much of the Shavian outlook passé and contemptible " . 
 " Creative evolution " , Shaw 's version of the new science of eugenics , became an increasing theme in his political writing after 1900 . He introduced his theories in The Revolutionist 's Handbook ( 1903 ) , an appendix to Man and Superman , and developed them further during the 1920s in Back to Methuselah . A 1946 Life magazine article observed that Shaw had " always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist " . By 1933 , in the preface to On the Rocks , he was writing that " if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it " ; critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony . In an article in the American magazine Liberty , in September 1938 , Shaw included the statement : " There are many people in the world who ought to be liquidated " . Many commentators assumed that such comments were intended as a joke , although in the worst possible taste . Otherwise , Life magazine concluded , " this silliness can be classed with his more innocent bad guesses " . 
 = = = Fiction = = = 
 Shaw 's fiction @-@ writing was largely confined to the five unsuccessful novels written in the period 1879 – 1885 . Immaturity ( 1879 ) is a semi @-@ autobiographical portrayal of mid @-@ Victorian England , Shaw 's " own David Copperfield " according to Weintraub . The Irrational Knot ( 1880 ) is a critique of conventional marriage , in which Weintraub finds the characterisations lifeless , " hardly more than animated theories " . Shaw was pleased with his third novel , Love Among the Artists ( 1881 ) , feeling that it marked a turning point in his development as a thinker , although he had no more success with it than with its predecessors . Cashel Byron 's Profession ( 1882 ) is , says Weintraub , an indictment of society which anticipates Shaw 's first full @-@ length play , Mrs Warren 's Profession . Shaw later explained that he had intended An Unsocial Socialist as the first section of a monumental depiction of the downfall of capitalism . Gareth Griffith , in a study of Shaw 's political thought , sees the novel as an interesting record of conditions , both in society at large and in the nascent socialist movement of the 1880s . 
 Shaw 's only subsequent fiction of any substance was his 1932 novella The Adventures of the Black Girl In Her Search for God , written during a visit to South Africa in 1932 . The eponymous girl , intelligent , inquisitive , and converted to Christianity by insubstantial missionary teaching , sets out to find God , on a journey that after many adventures and encounters , leads her to a secular conclusion . The story , on publication , offended some Christians and was banned in Ireland by the Board of Censors . 
 = = = Letters and diaries = = = 
 Shaw was a prolific correspondent throughout his life . His letters , edited by Dan H. Laurence , were published between 1965 and 1988 . Shaw once estimated his letters would occupy twenty volumes ; Laurence commented that , unedited , they would fill many more . Shaw wrote more than a quarter of a million letters , of which about ten per cent have survived ; 2 @,@ 653 letters are printed in Laurence 's four volumes . Among Shaw 's many regular correspondents were his childhood friend Edward McNulty ; his theatrical colleagues ( and <unk> amoureuses ) Mrs Patrick Campbell and Ellen Terry ; writers including Lord Alfred Douglas , H. G. Wells and G. K. Chesterton ; the boxer Gene Tunney ; the nun Laurentia McLachlan ; and the art expert Sydney Cockerell . In 2007 a 316 @-@ page volume consisting entirely of Shaw 's letters to The Times was published . 
 Shaw 's diaries for 1885 – 97 , edited by Weintraub , were published in two volumes , with a total of 1 @,@ 241 pages , in 1986 . Reviewing them , the Shaw scholar Fred Crawford wrote : " Although the primary interest for <unk> is the material that supplements what we already know about Shaw 's life and work , the diaries are also valuable as a historical and sociological document of English life at the end of the Victorian age . " After 1897 pressure of other writing led Shaw to give up keeping a diary . 
 = = = Miscellaneous and autobiographical = = = 
 Through his journalism , pamphlets and occasional longer works , Shaw wrote on many subjects . His range of interest and enquiry included vivisection , vegetarianism , religion , language , cinema and photography , on all of which he wrote and spoke copiously . Collections of his writings on these and other subjects were published , mainly after his death , together with volumes of selected aphorisms , " wit and wisdom " and general journalism . 
 Despite the many books written about him ( Holroyd counts 80 by 1939 ) Shaw 's autobiographical output , apart from his diaries , was relatively slight . He gave interviews to newspapers — " GBS <unk> " , to The Daily Mail in 1904 is an example — and provided sketches to would @-@ be biographers whose work was rejected by Shaw and never published . In 1939 Shaw drew on these materials to produce Shaw Gives Himself Away , a miscellany which , a year before his death , he revised and republished as Sixteen Self Sketches ( there were seventeen ) . He made it clear to his publishers that this slim book was in no sense a full autobiography . 
 = = Beliefs and opinions = = 
 In his lifetime Shaw professed many beliefs , often contradictory . This inconsistency was partly an intentional provocation — the Spanish scholar @-@ statesman Salvador de Madariaga describes Shaw as " a pole of negative electricity set in a people of positive electricity " . In one area at least Shaw was constant : in his lifelong refusal to follow normal English forms of spelling and punctuation . He favoured archaic spellings such as " shew " for " show " ; he dropped the " u " in words like " honour " and " favour " ; and wherever possible he rejected the apostrophe in contractions such as " won 't " or " that 's " . In his will Shaw ordered that after some specified legacies his remaining assets were to form a trust to pay for fundamental reform of the English alphabet , into a phonetic version of forty letters . Though Shaw 's intentions were clear , his drafting was flawed , and the courts initially ruled the intended trust void . A later out @-@ of @-@ court agreement provided a sum of £ 8 @,@ 300 for spelling reform ; the bulk of his fortune went to the residuary legatees — the British Museum , the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the National Gallery of Ireland . Most of the £ 8 @,@ 300 went on a special phonetic edition of Androcles and the Lion , published in 1962 to a largely indifferent reception . 
 Less consistently maintained were Shaw 's views on religion and Christianity . Having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist , in middle age he explained this as a reaction against the Old Testament image of a vengeful Jehovah . By the early 20th century he termed himself a " mystic " , although Gary Sloan , in an essay on Shaw 's beliefs , disputes his credentials as such . In 1913 Shaw declared that he was not religious " in the sectarian sense " , aligning himself with Jesus as " a person of no religion " . In the preface ( 1915 ) to Androcles and the Lion , Shaw asks " Why not give Christianity a chance " ? contending that Britain 's social order resulted from the continuing choice of Barabbas over Christ . In a broadcast just before the Second World War , Shaw invoked the Sermon on the Mount , " a very moving exhortation , and it gives you one first @-@ rate tip , which is to do good to those who <unk> use you and persecute you " . In his will , Shaw stated that his " religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution . " He requested that no one should imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation , and that no memorial to him should " take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice . " 
 Shaw espoused racial equality , and inter @-@ marriage between people of different races . Despite his expressed wish to be fair to Hitler , he called anti @-@ Semitism " the hatred of the lazy , ignorant fat @-@ headed Gentile for the pertinacious Jew who , schooled by adversity to use his brains to the utmost , outdoes him in business " . In The Jewish Chronicle he wrote in 1932 , " In every country you can find rabid people who have a phobia against Jews , Jesuits , Armenians , Negroes , Freemasons , Irishmen , or simply foreigners as such . Political parties are not above exploiting these fears and jealousies . " 
 In 1903 Shaw joined in a controversy about vaccination against smallpox . He called vaccination " a peculiarly filthy piece of witchcraft " ; in his view immunisation campaigns were a cheap and inadequate substitute for a decent programme of housing for the poor , which would , he declared , be the means of eradicating smallpox and other infectious diseases . Less contentiously , Shaw was keenly interested in transport ; Laurence observed in 1992 a need for a published study of Shaw 's interest in " bicycling , motorbikes , automobiles , and planes , climaxing in his joining the Interplanetary Society in his nineties . " Shaw published articles on travel , took photographs of his journeys , and submitted notes to the Royal Automobile Club . 
 Shaw strove throughout his adult life to be referred to as " Bernard Shaw " rather than " George Bernard Shaw " , but confused matters by continuing to use his full initials — G.B.S. — as a by @-@ line , and often signed himself " G. Bernard Shaw " . He left instructions in his will that his executor ( the Public Trustee ) was to license publication of his works only under the name Bernard Shaw . Shaw scholars including Ervine , Judith Evans , Holroyd , Laurence and Weintraub , and many publishers have respected Shaw 's preference , although the Cambridge University Press was among the exceptions with its 1988 Cambridge Companion to George Bernard Shaw .

 = = = Theatrical = = = 
 Shaw did not found a school of dramatists as such , but Crawford asserts that today " we recognise [ him ] as second only to Shakespeare in the British theatrical tradition ... the proponent of the theater of ideas " who struck a death @-@ blow to 19th @-@ century melodrama . According to Laurence , Shaw pioneered " intelligent " theatre , in which the audience was required to think , thereby paving the way for the new breeds of 20th @-@ century playwrights from Galsworthy to Pinter . 
 Crawford lists numerous playwrights whose work owes something to that of Shaw . Among those active in Shaw 's lifetime he includes Noël Coward , who based his early comedy The Young Idea on You Never Can Tell and continued to draw on the older man 's works in later plays . T. S. Eliot , by no means an admirer of Shaw , admitted that the epilogue of Murder in the Cathedral , in which Becket 's <unk> explain their actions to the audience , might have been influenced by Saint Joan . The critic Eric Bentley comments that Eliot 's later play The Confidential Clerk " had all the earmarks of <unk> ... without the merits of the real Bernard Shaw " . Among more recent British dramatists , Crawford marks Tom Stoppard as " the most Shavian of contemporary playwrights " ; Shaw 's " serious farce " is continued in the works of Stoppard 's contemporaries Alan Ayckbourn , Henry <unk> and Peter Nichols . 
 Shaw 's influence crossed the Atlantic at an early stage . Bernard Dukore notes that he was successful as a dramatist in America ten years before achieving comparable success in Britain . Among many American writers professing a direct debt to Shaw , Eugene O 'Neill became an admirer at the age of seventeen , after reading The Quintessence of Ibsenism . Other Shaw @-@ influenced American playwrights mentioned by Dukore are Elmer Rice , for whom Shaw " opened doors , turned on lights , and expanded horizons " ; William Saroyan , who empathised with Shaw as " the embattled individualist against the philistines " ; and S. N. Behrman , who was inspired to write for the theatre after attending a performance of Caesar and Cleopatra : " I thought it would be agreeable to write plays like that " . 
 Assessing Shaw 's reputation in a 1976 critical study , T. F. Evans described Shaw as unchallenged in his lifetime and since as the leading English @-@ language dramatist of the century , and as a master of prose style . The following year , in a contrary assessment , the playwright John Osborne castigated The Guardian 's theatre critic Michael Billington for referring to Shaw as " the greatest British dramatist since Shakespeare " . Osborne responded that Shaw " is the most fraudulent , inept writer of Victorian melodramas ever to gull a timid critic or fool a dull public " . Despite this hostility , Crawford sees the influence of Shaw in some of Osborne 's plays , and concludes that though the latter 's work is neither imitative nor derivative , these affinities are sufficient to classify Osborne as an inheritor of Shaw . 
 In a 1983 study , R. J. Kaufmann suggests that Shaw was a key forerunner — " godfather , if not actually finicky paterfamilias " — of the Theatre of the Absurd . Two further aspects of Shaw 's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford : his opposition to stage censorship , which was finally ended in 1968 , and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a National Theatre . Shaw 's short 1910 play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets , in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for the endowment of a state theatre , was part of this campaign . 
 Writing in The New Statesman in 2012 Daniel Janes commented that Shaw 's reputation had declined by the time of his 150th anniversary in 2006 but had recovered considerably . In Janes 's view , the many current revivals of Shaw 's major works showed the playwright 's " almost unlimited relevance to our times " . In the same year , Mark Lawson wrote in The Guardian that Shaw 's moral concerns engaged present @-@ day audiences , and made him — like his model , Ibsen — one of the most popular playwrights in contemporary British theatre . 
 = = = General = = = 
 In the 1940s the author Harold Nicolson advised the National Trust not to accept the bequest of Shaw 's Corner , predicting that Shaw would be totally forgotten within fifty years . In the event , Shaw 's broad cultural legacy , embodied in the widely used term " Shavian " , has endured and is nurtured by Shaw Societies in various parts of the world . The original society was founded in London in 1941 and survives ; it organises meetings and events , and publishes a regular bulletin The Shavian . The Shaw Society of America began in June 1950 ; it foundered in the 1970s but its journal , adopted by Penn State University Press , continued to be published as Shaw : The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies until 2004 . A second American organisation , founded in 1951 as " The Bernard Shaw Society " , remains active as of 2016 . More recent societies have been established in Japan and India . 
 Besides his collected music criticism , Shaw has left a varied musical legacy , not all of it of his choosing . Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre ( " my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own " ) two of his plays were turned into musical comedies : Arms and the Man was the basis of The Chocolate Soldier in 1908 , with music by Oscar Straus , and Pygmalion was adapted in 1956 as My Fair Lady with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe . Although he had a high regard for Elgar , Shaw turned down the composer 's request for an opera libretto , but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar 's Third Symphony , and was the dedicatee of The Severn Suite ( 1930 ) . 
 The substance of Shaw 's political legacy is uncertain . In 1921 Shaw 's erstwhile collaborator William Archer , in a letter to the playwright , wrote : " I doubt if there is any case of a man so widely read , heard , seen , and known as yourself , who has produced so little effect on his generation . " Margaret Cole , who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age , professed never to have understood him . She thought he worked " immensely hard " at politics , but essentially , she surmises , it was for fun — " the fun of a brilliant artist " . After Shaw 's death , Pearson wrote : " No one since the time of Tom Paine has had so definite an influence on the social and political life of his time and country as Bernard Shaw . " 
 In its obituary tribute to Shaw , The Times Literary Supplement concluded : 
 He was no originator of ideas . He was an insatiable adopter and adapter , an incomparable <unk> with the thoughts of the forerunners . Nietzsche , Samuel Butler ( <unk> ) , Marx , Shelley , Blake , Dickens , William Morris , Ruskin , Beethoven and Wagner all had their applications and misapplications . By bending to their service all the faculties of a powerful mind , by inextinguishable wit , and by every artifice of argument , he carried their thoughts as far as they would reach — so far beyond their sources that they came to us with the vitality of the newly created .

 = Flat Holm = 
 Flat Holm ( Welsh : Ynys Echni ) is a limestone island lying in the Bristol Channel approximately 6 km ( 4 mi ) from Lavernock Point in the Vale of Glamorgan ( though it forms part of Cardiff ) . It includes the most southerly point of Wales . 
 The island has a long history of occupation , dating at least from Anglo @-@ Saxon and Viking age . Religious uses include visits by disciples of Saint Cadoc in the 6th century , and in 1835 it was the site of the foundation of the Bristol Channel Mission , which later became the Mission to Seafarers . A sanatorium for cholera patients was built in 1896 as the isolation hospital for the port of Cardiff . Guglielmo Marconi transmitted the first wireless signals over open sea from Flat Holm to Lavernock . Because of frequent shipwrecks a lighthouse was built on the island , which was replaced by a Trinity House lighthouse in 1737 . Because of its strategic position on the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff a series of gun emplacements , known as Flat Holm Battery , were built in the 1860s as part of a line of defences , known as Palmerston Forts . On the outbreak of World War II , the island was rearmed . 
 It forms part of the City and County of Cardiff and is now managed by Cardiff Council 's Flat Holm Project Team and designated as a Local Nature Reserve , Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area , because of the maritime grassland and rare plants such as rock sea @-@ lavender ( Limonium <unk> ) and wild leek ( Allium ampeloprasum ) . The island also has significant breeding colonies of lesser black @-@ backed gulls ( Larus fuscus ) , herring gulls ( Larus argentatus ) and great black @-@ backed gulls ( Larus marinus ) . It is also home to slow worms ( Anguis fragilis ) with larger than usual blue markings . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Bronze Age and Early Christian = = = 
 The first traces of human habitation of the island are from the late Bronze Age , 900 to 700 BC , known as the Ewart Park Phase . A bronze axe head was discovered on the island in 1988 , between the island 's modern lone farmhouse and West Beach , at grid reference <unk> . In the sub @-@ Roman period of the 6th century AD , it became a retreat for Saint Cadoc , who lived on the island as a hermit for seven years . His friend , Saint Gildas lived at the same time on nearby Steep Holm , and the two sometimes met up for prayers . Gildas left the island to become Abbot of Glastonbury . 
 In June 1815 , a Dr Thomas Turner visited Flat Holm in a small boat and was stranded for a week due to high winds . He discovered two Christian graves located close together in a field 23 m ( 75 ft ) northeast of the island 's present farmhouse ; one grave had been opened and contained a male skeleton . The open grave 's headstone was made of <unk> marble and engraved with a Celtic cross , but had since broken in two . A second disturbed grave , also marked with a headstone , was found to the southeast and contained a coffin constructed with iron bolts . Inside the coffin were two skeletons which had been doused in lime , indicating that the occupants had probably died from a contagious disease . 
 = = = Anglo @-@ Saxon and medieval = = = 
 Anglo @-@ Saxons called the island <unk> . <unk> derives from an Irish word meaning churchyard or graveyard , alluding to the belief that the island had religious significance as a place of burial to people at the time . However , the island 's current name of " Holm " comes from the Old Norse meaning " island in an estuary " . Records indicate that a Viking fleet from the south of Brittany led by two earls , Ottir ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( possibly Ottir 's king Ragnall ) , took refuge on the island following their defeat by the Saxons at Watchet . 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle records that in 1067 , Gytha <unk> , mother of Harold II , the last Anglo @-@ Saxon king of England , stayed on the island before travelling to St Omer in France after the Norman conquest of England . After the invasion , Lord Robert Fitzhamon , a cousin of William the Conqueror , formed the Shire of Glamorgan in Wales proper , with Cardiff Castle at the centre of his new domain . Flat Holm came within the parish boundary of St Mary 's , one of Cardiff 's two parish churches , and was kept as a hereditary property of the Norman Lords of Glamorgan . 
 A survey by archaeologist Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed a number of medieval potsherds in the vicinity of the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including middens containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and cockle shells . Fragments of green glazed jugs and <unk> from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island . The presence of Pennant sandstone roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th @-@ century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building , possibly a chapel , demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed . Property records from 1542 show that King Henry VIII granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund <unk> . His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins . 
 = = = 18th century – smuggling = = = 
 During the 18th century , the island 's location made it an ideal base for smuggling . It has been alleged that an old mine shaft on the north side of the island connects with a series of natural tunnels , and a concealed exit to the sea . Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts , customs authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to take them to the island . According to tradition , a small cave in the east cliff at Flat Holm was used for the storage of contraband , mainly tea and brandy . 
 = = = 19th century – Seafarer 's Mission and Marconi = = = 
 In 1835 , clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon , England voluntarily ministered to the population of the island . Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel . The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers , which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports . A service is held annually to bless the island . 
 On 13 May 1897 , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old Italian inventor named Guglielmo Marconi , assisted by a Cardiff Post Office engineer named George Kemp , transmitted the first wireless signals over open sea from Flat Holm to Lavernock Point near Penarth , Wales . Having failed to interest the Italian government in his project , Marconi brought his telegraphy system to Britain . Here he met Welshman William Preece who was at that time Chief Engineer of the General Post Office and a major figure in the field . Marconi and Preece erected a 34 m ( 112 ft ) high transmitting mast on Flat Holm as well as a 30 m ( 98 ft ) receiving mast at Lavernock Point . The first trials on 11 May and 12 failed . On 13 May , the mast at Lavernock was raised to 50 m ( 160 ft ) and the signals were received clearly . The message sent by Morse Code was " Are you ready " ; the original paper Morse slip , signed by both Marconi and Kemp , is now in the National Museum of Wales . 
 The island made communication history again on 8 October 2002 , by becoming one of the first areas of South Wales to link to the Internet through a wireless connection deployed by Cardiff Council as part of the Flat Holm Project . The connection is used for Internet , access to Cardiff Council 's data network and VOIP telephony . There are two handsets in the main farmhouse that are part of the councils own PBX thus having Cardiff dialling codes . 105 years after Marconi , Spencer Pearson an IT Consultant with Cardiff Council made the first telephone call from the island to his office at County Hall , Atlantic Wharf , Cardiff . 
 = = Shipwrecks = = 
 The treacherous conditions for ships around the island led to several shipwrecks . The British passenger vessel Tapley lost seven passengers when it became stranded on Flat Holm in January 1773 on its passage from Cork , Ireland to Bristol . 
 On 23 October 1817 , a British sloop , William and Mary , foundered after hitting the rock islands near Flat Holm known as The Wolves . The ship was en route from Bristol to Waterford and sank within fifteen minutes . The Mate , John <unk> , and two sailors made off in the only lifeboat . Fifteen survivors were later rescued , having clung to the ship 's rigging , but fifty @-@ four other passengers were lost . Fifty of the bodies were recovered from the ship and were buried on Flat Holm . 
 In 1938 , the steamship Norman Queen ran ashore on Flat Holm but was refloated , and in 1941 the steamship Middlesex was lost . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Flat Holm ( Welsh : Ynys Echni ) is located in the Bristol Channel . It is a small , almost circular , limestone island , approximately 620 m ( 2 @,@ 030 ft ) in diameter , covering 35 ha ( 86 acres ) . It rises in a gentle slope from the exposed western rocky shore to more sheltered easterly cliffs , at the top of which stands the prominent lighthouse . At its highest point it is 32 m ( 105 ft ) above sea level . Flat Holm is considered to be part of Wales , whereas the nearby island of Steep Holm ( Welsh : Ynys <unk> ) is considered part of England . About 1 @.@ 3 km ( 0 @.@ 81 mi ) northwest of Flat Holm are two very small islands collectively known as The Wolves , measuring approximately 25 m ( 82 ft ) by 20 m ( 66 ft ) . 
 The tidal range in the Bristol Channel is 15 m ( 49 ft ) ; second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada . 
 = = Geology = = 
 During much of the most recent ice ages , from 1 @.@ 8 million years ago , the sea level in the Severn Estuary was some 50 m ( 160 ft ) below the current level and Flat Holm was joined to the Somerset coast as an extremity of the Mendip Hills . Sometime since the start of the Mesolithic period , 15 @,@ 000 years ago , the ice sheets retreated , and the flat plains surrounding the river estuary flooded ; the hilltops of Mendip Hills became the islands of Flat Holm and Steep Holm . 
 The Carboniferous Limestone of which Flat Holm and neighbouring Steep Holm are composed forms a part of a wider Mesozoic basin extending from the Bristol and Mendip area westwards beneath the mouth of the Severn to South Wales , outcropping to the west at Sully Island and Barry , Wales . Part of the island is designated a Geological Conservation Review ( GCR ) Site and is a recognised Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) . The GCR and SSSI interest lies along the south @-@ western shoreline from the north west point to Lighthouse Point where a wave cut portion of the limestone displays large fossil " ripple marks " . 
 There are <unk> ( i.e. silver @-@ bearing ) galena deposits on Flat Holm ; the pits and mounds visible on the surface of the island are a result of trial borings . A dispute over lead mining rights in the 1780s ended with John Stuart , Lord Mount Stuart making an official complaint that the lighthouse keeper was using the coals intended for the lighthouse for processing lead . Mining for lead was not profitable , however , and the works were abandoned . Red marl from the Triassic Period fills joints in the Carboniferous Limestone showing evidence of karstic ( cave forming ) processes during this period . Caves on the western and north @-@ eastern sides of the island were used during the years of smuggling .

 = = = Lighthouse and foghorn station = = = 
 Flat Holm Lighthouse is 30 m ( 98 ft ) high and 50 m ( 160 ft ) above mean high water . It has a 100 watt lamp that flashes three times every ten seconds , and is red from 106 ° to 140 ° ; white to 151 ° ; red to 203 ° ; white to 106 ° . White light visibility up to 18 nmi , this data as recorded in 1965 in Reed 's Nautical Almanac but Trinity House now note visibility as 15 nmi for the white light and 12 nmi for the red light . 28 and 22 km ( 15 and 12 nmi ) . 
 The first light on the island was a simple brazier mounted on a wooden frame , which stood on the high eastern part of the island . In 1733 the Society of Merchant Venturers of Bristol found the brazier to be unreliable and petitioned the General Lighthouse Authority , Trinity House , for an actual lighthouse , but the petition failed . In 1735 Mr. William Crispe of Bristol submitted a proposal to build a lighthouse at his own expense . This initial proposal also failed but negotiations resumed in 1736 when 60 soldiers drowned after their vessel crashed on the Wolves rocks near Flat Holm . Following this disaster , the Society of Merchant Venturers finally supported William Crispe 's proposal . Crispe agreed to pay £ 800 ( £ 110 @,@ 552 , $ 220 @,@ 241 in 2008 ) for the construction of the tower as well as the fees permits . The construction of the tower finished in 1737 and it began operating on 25 March 1738 . 
 The lighthouse was struck by lightning in a severe storm on 22 December 1790 . The keeper narrowly escaped but the top of the tower was severely damaged . A 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) tall crack on the side had to be repaired as did the oak beams supporting the top platform . In 1819 , the circular stone tower was updated to house a more powerful lantern ; the tower was raised from 21 m ( 69 ft ) to 27 m ( 89 ft ) . A clockwork mechanism to rotate the light was installed in 1881 . Flat Holm Lighthouse was the last signal station in the country in private ownership . In July 1822 , Trinity House finally bought the lease for £ 15 @,@ 838 @.@ 10 ( £ 1 @.@ 2 million , $ 2 @.@ 4 million in 2008 ) . Two years later a fountain oil lamp was installed and the lantern was raised by another 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) . In 1867 a lantern 4 m ( 13 ft ) in diameter was installed . The lighthouse was renovated in 1929 to include accommodations for up to four keepers . This lasted until 1988 , when the lighthouse became fully automated and the keepers were withdrawn . In 1997 , the light was modernised and converted to solar power . It is now monitored and controlled by the Trinity House Operations Control Centre at Harwich , in Essex . 
 Built by Trinity House in 1906 , the foghorn building is a Grade II listed building . The siren was originally powered by a 15 hp ( 11 kW ) engine , which gave two blasts in quick succession at two @-@ minute intervals that could be clearly heard by people living on both coasts but for many years following World War II , the foghorn was heard as one long and one short blast and nautical almanac data as at 1965 , stated that the interval was <unk> Volunteers from the Flat Holm Society , with help from the Prince 's Trust , restored the horn and engines in the 1960s . The Foghorn Station was officially reopened by the Welsh Secretary and the Welsh Assembly First Secretary in May 2000 when the foghorn was sounded for the first time since 1988 . 
 = = = Farm House = = = 
 Records show that monks from St Augustine 's Abbey in Bristol established a dairy farm and grange on the island after Flat Holm was granted to them by Robert , Earl of Gloucester in 1150 . Dr Thomas Turner , who was stranded on Flat Holm during a visit in 1815 , passed the time by exploring the island . He noted that the tax @-@ exempt abbey farm was prospering and counted " seven cows , two bulls , five sheep , one horse , two pigs and two dogs " . The 1881 census record for Flat Holm shows that the farmhouse was later occupied by Henry and Emily Morgan , their four sons and four daughters , a governess ( Henry 's niece ) and Emma Craddock , a 14 @-@ year @-@ old servant . In 1897 the farmhouse was converted into The Flat Holm Hotel , and a bar and skittle alley were added , but the hotel closed after a few years . The farmhouse has been renovated by the Flat Holm Project and is now used as accommodation for visitors staying on the island . 
 = = = Batteries and barracks = = = 
 Flat Holm was fortified in the 1860s following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France , where they had been concerned by the strength of the French Navy . The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom , under direction of Lord Palmerston , recommended fortification of the coast in 1865 . The defences on the island , which became part of a line of defences known as the Palmerston Forts , were completed in 1869 . 
 Flat Holm Battery is a series of gun emplacements on Flat Holm built to protect Bristol and Cardiff across the channel . There are remains of four battery sites on the island : 
 * Castle Rock Battery : three guns in two Moncrieff pits and one open @-@ backed pit 
 Farm House Battery : two guns in one full Moncrieff pit and one open @-@ backed pit 
 Well Battery : one gun in an open @-@ backed Moncrieff pit . The gun was removed by Army Apprentices in 1964 . 
 Lighthouse Battery : three guns in two full Moncrieff pits and one open @-@ backed pit 
 These four emplacements run from the northern to the southern point of the island , along the western coast . Nine Rifled muzzle loaders ( RMLs ) on disappearing Moncrieff carriages were built at the Royal Gun Foundry , Woolwich . They were mounted in four separate batteries , all in Moncrieff pits , 2 m ( 7 ft ) in diameter and 3 m ( 10 ft ) deep , constructed of limestone blocks and bricks . These pits had the advantage of being almost invisible to shipping and also offered protection to the gun crews . The RML 7 @-@ inch 7 ton guns were too heavy for mobile land service . They consisted of a steel rifle tube surrounded by wrought iron coils , and cascabel , with an overall length of each gun is 361 centimetres ( 142 in ) . They used a 52 @.@ 3 kg ( 115 lb ) Palliser shell and were mounted on the Moncrieff disappearing carriage . The guns were never needed and were fired only for test purposes . 
 In 1869 , stone barracks were built to sleep up to 50 men . However , the 1881 Census for Flat Holm shows that the barracks were occupied only by the Master Gunner , Thomas Barrett , his family , and five soldiers . Barrett 's son , Albert , was born on the island on 31 December 1881 . The men were stationed on the island to keep the guns in good working order but the garrison would have been reinforced by regular artillery and volunteer troops if ever an invasion had been imminent . The barracks for the battery were located near the southernmost battery emplacement . Other fortifications included a large drainage basin , underground storage tank , an administrative building and a secure store . A " ditch @-@ and @-@ bank " system served to protect the Lighthouse Battery from cross @-@ island attack . The barracks were vacated in 1901 and the buildings have now been restored by the Flat Holm Project for educational use . 
 = = = Radar station = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War II over 350 soldiers of the Royal Artillery were stationed on the island . Flat Holm was re @-@ armed with four 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns and associated searchlights for anti @-@ aircraft and close defence , together with two 40mm Bofors guns . A GL ( Gun Laying ) Mk II radar station was also placed in the centre of the island . The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences , and protected the Atlantic shipping convoys between Cardiff , Barry , and Flat Holm . These works were abandoned after the war and the island has had no military use since . Flat Holm 's helipad still remains , however , at the centre of the island . 
 = = = Isolation hospital = = = 
 In July 1883 , the steamship <unk> left three seamen on the island who were believed to be suffering from cholera , one of whom subsequently died . The only accommodation was a canvas tent , and the regular inhabitants of the island petitioned Cardiff council for compensation , complaining of loss of income from visitors and difficulty in selling vegetables grown on their farm at the market in Cardiff . In 1896 , the Marquis of Bute , then @-@ owner of Flat Holm , agreed to lease all the land that was not already in use by the military or the lighthouse to the Cardiff Corporation for £ 50 per year . The corporation then built a permanent sanatorium on the land for use by cholera patients . The building was described in The Lancet as a " pavilion " comprising two six @-@ bed wards and a nurse 's room . In 1893 , three more sailors arrived in Cardiff from Marseilles on the SS Blue Jacket and were suspected of having cholera . The first engineer , Thomas Smith , and able seaman Robert Doran , were deported to the isolation hospital on Flat Holm to prevent spread of the disease . The second mate , P. J. Morris , was also sent to the island as a precautionary measure , but quickly recovered . The Flat Holm sanatorium is unique in being the only Victorian isolation hospital sited on a British offshore island . The last patient to die in the hospital , a victim of bubonic plague , was cremated on the island at the end of the 19th century . The hospital finally closed in 1935 and has remained derelict since . Both the hospital main block and laundry block are Grade II listed buildings and are considered to be " at risk " . 
 = = Flat Holm Project = = 
 In 1975 , the South Glamorgan County Council leased the island for the next 99 years . In March 1995 , the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50 @-@ year lease from the Crown Estate starting on 12 December 1995 . Flat Holm is now designated as a Local Nature Reserve , as stipulated in that lease . It is managed by the Cardiff Council as The Flat Holm Project . The project team operates the Lewis Alexander , a boat which was purpose @-@ built for the crossing to Flat Holm and which is able to carry up to 45 passengers and essential supplies to the island . The work of the Flat Holm Project is supported by the registered charity the Flat Holm Society . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 Flat Holm was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) in 1972 . The designation covers the maritime grassland which is mainly concentrated around the edges of the island . 
 There are no endemic plant species but the relative isolation of the island has allowed a number of hardy species such as bird 's @-@ foot trefoil ( Lotus corniculatus ) and biting stonecrop ( Sedum acre ) to thrive . There are also a number of relatively rare plants , such as rock sea @-@ lavender ( Limonium <unk> ) , and wild leek ( Allium ampeloprasum ) . The leek grows to 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) and Flat Holm is one of only five places in the UK where it is found . Related to the onion , the leek has a bulb that grows for several years producing only leaves , then blooms with large purple flowers that smell of garlic . After flowering the bulb dies and produces up to 150 <unk> . 
 Others plants may have been introduced by the Augustinian Community for their medicinal uses . These include dove 's @-@ foot crane 's @-@ bill Geranium molle , an anodyne plant claimed by Nicholas Culpeper to have a wide range of medicinal uses and an " excellent good cure for those that have inward wounds , hurts , or bruises , both to stay the bleeding , to dissolve and expel the congealed blood , and to heal the parts , as also to cleanse and heal outward sores , ulcers and fistulas " . The wild peony ( Paeonia mascula ) was introduced to the island ( and nearby Steep Holm ) , possibly by monks , and has naturalised . Thirty @-@ seven plants were taken to the island from Steep Holm by Frank Harris , the farmer at the time , in the 1930s , many of which died during the World War II occupation and fortification of the island . One remaining plant was reintroduced by David <unk> , the Flat Holm Warden , in 1982 and is protected by fencing near the path to the lighthouse . A few plants grown from seed also survive in the island 's farmhouse garden . 
 The island has a significant breeding colony of over 4 @,@ 000 pairs of lesser black @-@ backed gulls ( Larus fuscus ) , 400 pairs of herring gulls ( Larus argentatus ) , 2 pairs of great black @-@ backed gulls ( Larus marinus ) and varying numbers of common shelduck ( Tadorna <unk> ) and Eurasian oystercatchers ( <unk> ) . The feeding habits of lesser black @-@ backed gulls were studied in 1989 , and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size . 
 The island is also home to slow worms ( Anguis fragilis ) . Flat Holm 's slow @-@ worm population has unusually large blue markings . 
 The island 's rabbit population , introduced for farming in the 12th century , suffers from myxomatosis , which effectively contains the numbers . The island has been grazed since 1989 , initially by goats , but also by sheep since 1992 . In 1997 Soay sheep were introduced and as of 2008 there are 28 sheep grazing wild on the island . 
 = = Sustainability = = 
 The Flat Holm project aims to develop the island as a showcase of sustainable technologies . The original power supply consisted of several diesel generators at different properties and unconnected to each other . In 2006 , underground cables were installed to form a ‘ mini @-@ grid ’ between the farmhouse , workshops and the fog horn keeper 's cottage . This was powered with a ( 13 @.@ 5 kW ) inverter / charger system located at the farmhouse with the farmhouse diesel generator as back @-@ up . 
 In 2007 the system was extended to include a battery bank charged by two photovoltaic solar arrays , and by a 6 kW wind turbine sited at a redundant telecommunications tower on the high point of the island . 
 = = Severn Barrage study = = 
 If a Severn Barrage were ever to be constructed it could have consequences for Flat Holm , depending on the design and the route . A number of studies have been proposed , the latest being when John Hutton , Secretary of State for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform , announced a further feasibility study on 25 September 2007 to follow on the report by the Sustainable Development Commission . 
 The proposal for a hydro @-@ electric barrier to generate 8 @.@ 6 GW and meet five percent of Britain 's power needs , is being opposed by some environmental groups . This proposed barrage would pass two miles ( 3 km ) west of Flat Holm . The study is expected to last at least two years and will be split into two stages with a decision point at the end of each . The first , which is likely to run until late 2008 , will focus on high @-@ level issues and reach an initial view on whether there are any fundamental issues that would preclude a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary . Subject to the decision at the end of the first phase , the second phase will look at the issues in more detail and culminate in a full public consultation in early 2010 .

 = The Northern Celestial Masters = 
 The Northern Celestial Masters type of the Way of the Celestial Master ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Tiān Shī Dào ) Daoist movement existed in the north of China during the Southern and Northern Dynasties . The Northern Celestial Masters were a continuation of the Way of the Celestial Masters as it had been practiced in Sichuan province by Zhang Lu and his followers . After the community was forced to relocate in 215 CE , a group of Celestial Masters established themselves in Northern China . Kou Qianzhi , from a family who followed the Celestial Master , brought a new version of Celestial Master Daoism to the Northern Wei . The Northern Wei government embraced his form of Daoism and established it as the state religion , thereby creating a new Daoist theocracy that lasted until 450 CE . The arrival of Buddhism had great influence on the Northern Celestial Masters , bringing monasticism and influencing the diet of practitioners . Art produced in areas dominated by the Northern Celestial Masters also began to show Buddhist influence . When the theocracy collapsed , many Daoists fled to Louguan , which quickly became an important religious center . The Northern Celestial Masters survived as a distinct school at Louguan until the late 7th century CE , when they became integrated into the wider Daoist movement . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Northern Wei ( 424 @-@ 450 ) = = = 
 Kou Qianzhi was a member of Celestial Master family that came from an area near Chang 'an . Inspired by the burgeoning Daoist movement in Southern China , Kou retreated to Mount Song in Henan to receive inspiration . On the mountain , as described by the text The History of the Wei Dynasty , he was visited twice by Laozi . In his first visit in 415 , Laozi revealed to Kou a text known as the Laojun Yinsong Jiejing ( New Code ) . This text contained precepts designed for a new religious community . In 423 , a messenger of Laozi came and offered Kou a new text called the <unk> <unk> ( Perfect Scripture of Registers and Charts ) , which is now lost , and appointed him as the new Celestial Master . 
 In 424 , Kou took these texts with him to the Wei court . There , he was welcomed by Emperor <unk> and garnered the support of Cui Hao , the prime minister . Even though Cui Hao was a Confucianist , he greatly admired Kou and was immediately drawn to him . Cui also appreciated Kou 's mathematical skills and hoped that he might help him improve his own longevity techniques . They also shared a dream of a ' purified society , ' a land where peace and justice prevailed . Kou 's ' New Code ' was promulgated throughout the realm , and a large altar was built near the capital where 120 Daoist practitioners performed rites and prayers daily . Cui gained a great deal of power in the court , and in 444 began to purge the Buddhist clergy . This led to a major persecution against Buddhists in 446 . In 448 , Kou Qianzhi was ' released ' from his body , and Cui lost his greatest supporter at the court . Shortly after Kou 's death , Cui had a national history of Wei dynasty containing unflattering portraits of its rulers carved in stone . This so enraged the emperor , that he had Cui executed in 450 . After Cui 's execution , the Daoist community was forced to flee , with many of them settling at the Daoist center of Louguan . 
 = = = Louguan ( 450 @-@ 688 ) = = = 
 By the late 470s , Daoists fleeing from the Northern Wei court had transformed Louguan into an important religious center . According to legend , Louguan used to be the home of Yin Xi , the first recipient of the Dao de jing . At this time , the center 's buildings were greatly expanded , and many Daoist scriptures were collected , including materials from the Lingbao and Shangqing schools . During the 7th century , the school had a prominent role in a series of debates that examined whether Buddhism or Daoism would be better suited to bring stability to the realm . The first debate surrounded <unk> , a scholar and Daoist who proposed that Buddhism be abolished in China . Naturally , the Buddhists were not happy with his suggestions and countered his arguments in several treatises . The second debate concerned Lu <unk> , a friend of Fu Yi , who wrote about Buddhism 's inferiority to Daoism . The Tang emperors were in support of the Daoists , and in 637 issued an edict that secured the precedence of Daoism over Buddhism . This edict remained in place until 674 , when Empress Wu Zetian came to power . At the same time , Louguan also served as a refuge for Daoists fleeing the persecution of Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty to the south . The final Northern Celestial Master , Yin <unk> arrived at Louguan in 636 and later achieved the favor of the Gaozong Emperor . After Yin 's death in 688 , Louguan remained an important place of Daoist learning , but ceased to be considered part of a distinct school . 
 = = Texts = = 
 The most important text from the Northern Wei period of the Northern Celestial Masters is the Laojun Yinsong Jiejing ( New Code ) . This text was revealed to Kou Qianzhi in 415 , and is now mostly lost apart from a few fragments . The surviving text contains thirty @-@ six precepts that outline rules which a Daoist had to abide by . The behavioral rules outlined proper public conduct and what to do in case of sickness . There were also guidelines describing how banquets were to be set up , as well ritual instructions concerning funeral rites , immortality practice and petitions . 
 One of the most important text 's from the school 's Louguan period is called the <unk> ( The Scripture of Western Ascension ) . This text describes Laozi 's emigration to India and the transmission of the <unk> Jing to Yin Xi . However , the text is not really a narrative , but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life . The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world , outlines meditation techniques , and discusses the results of living a <unk> life and what happens after death . 
 = = Beliefs = = 
 The Northern Celestial Master variety of Daoism was both similar and different from Zhang Lu 's earlier form . Unlike prior incarnations of the Celestial Masters , which supported sexual practices as a means of achieving immortality , Kou 's text urged that the sexual arts be purged from the religion . In addition , he also states that religion must be purged of the imposition of religious taxes on the faithful and the inheritance of religious titles . In the Northern Celestial Masters , Laozi became closely linked with the Buddha , who was claimed to be a student of Laozi . There were also very specific dietary requirements that had to be followed , as well as other rules , many of which were influenced by Buddhism . The Northern Celestial Masters were also the first Daoists to practice a form of monasticism , another idea that came from Buddhism . Kou also condemned messianic movements and called for texts such as the Daodejing to be copied and recited . Those people who were good in life would gain immortality in a new age , whereas those who were bad would be reborn as insects or animals . 
 Some similarities between earlier Celestial Master Daoism include the role of Laozi . Laozi was viewed as the personification of the Dao , who existed for eternity and created the world . He was believed to be the creator of the universe and came to earth intermittently to bring forth sacred scriptures , including the <unk> Jing and <unk> Jing . Moreover , Laozi continued to appear periodically and bring forth new scriptures to both Kou Qianzhi and adherents at Louguan , surrounded by a celestial entourage and announced by a celestial envoy . Laozi was also extremely closely linked with the Buddha , and in certain sources , even became the Buddha or announced Yinxi as the Buddha . 
 = = Practices = = 
 The Northern Celestial Masters followed certain regular , communal rites . One of these communal rites involved formal banquets . These feasts could last as long as seven days . In order to purify themselves for feasts , members had to abstain from eating meat , garlic , green onions , ginger , leeks and onions . A banquet consisted of three courses – wine , rice and a vegetarian meal . Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and <unk> as well as the burning of incense . Banquets were also held when someone died . During these banquets , attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased . 
 While monasticism had existed in Chinese Buddhism , the Northern Celestial Masters were one of the first Daoist groups to practice it . Kou lived a monastic lifestyle on Songshan , known today for being the location of the Shaolin Monastery . Monasticism developed further during the Louguan phase of the Northern Celestial Masters due to this influence of Buddhism . During this period , a clear distinction developed between lay and monastic followers in Daoism . The ordination , precepts and way in which monks sought salvation were all influenced by Buddhism . 
 = = Art = = 
 Many art objects were produced in Northern China during the time of the Northern Celestial Masters . These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs . The image of the god ( usually Laozi ) , would be carved on the front side of a stone stele , with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving . The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead , a wish for the happiness of family members or wishes for political peace . The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state . This relationship is especially evident in some four @-@ sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two .

 = Comet Hyakutake = 
 Comet Hyakutake ( Japanese pronunciation : [ <unk> ̥ take ] , formally designated C / 1996 B2 ) is a comet , discovered on 31 January 1996 , that passed very close to Earth in March of that year . It was dubbed The Great Comet of 1996 ; its passage near the Earth was one of the closest cometary approaches of the previous 200 years . Hyakutake appeared very bright in the night sky and was widely seen around the world . The comet temporarily upstaged the much anticipated Comet Hale – Bopp , which was approaching the inner Solar System at the time . 
 Scientific observations of the comet led to several discoveries . Most surprising to cometary scientists was the first discovery of X @-@ ray emission from a comet , believed to have been caused by ionised solar wind particles interacting with neutral atoms in the coma of the comet . The Ulysses spacecraft unexpectedly crossed the comet 's tail at a distance of more than 500 million kilometres ( 3 @.@ 3 AU or 3 × 108 mi ) from the nucleus , showing that Hyakutake had the longest tail known for a comet . 
 Hyakutake is a long @-@ period comet . Before its most recent passage through the Solar System , its orbital period was about 17 @,@ 000 years , but the gravitational perturbation of the giant planets has increased this period to 70 @,@ 000 years . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The comet was discovered on 31 January 1996 , by Yuji Hyakutake , an amateur astronomer from southern Japan . He had been searching for comets for years and had moved to Kagoshima Prefecture partly for the dark skies in nearby rural areas . He was using a powerful set of binoculars with 150 mm ( 6 in ) objective lenses to scan the skies on the night of the discovery . 
 This comet was actually the second Comet Hyakutake ; Hyakutake had discovered comet C / 1995 Y1 several weeks earlier . While re @-@ observing his first comet ( which never became visible to the naked eye ) and the surrounding patch of sky , Hyakutake was surprised to find another comet in almost the same position as the first had been . Hardly believing a second discovery so soon after the first , Hyakutake reported his observation to the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan the following morning . Later that day , the discovery was confirmed by independent observations . 
 At the time of its discovery , the comet was shining at magnitude 11 @.@ 0 and had a coma approximately 2 @.@ 5 arcminutes across . It was approximately 2 astronomical units ( AU ) from the Sun . Later , a pre @-@ discovery image of the comet was found on a photograph taken on January 1 , when the comet was about 2 @.@ 4 AU from the Sun and had a magnitude of 13 @.@ 3 . 
 = = Orbit = = 
 When the first calculations of the comet 's orbit were made , scientists realized that it was going to pass just 0 @.@ 1 AU from Earth on 25 March . Only four comets in the previous century had passed closer . Comet Hale – Bopp was already being discussed as a possible " great comet " ; the astronomical community eventually realised that Hyakutake might also become spectacular because of its close approach . 
 Moreover , Comet Hyakutake 's orbit meant that it had last been to the inner Solar System approximately 17 @,@ 000 years earlier . Because it had probably passed close to the Sun several times before , the approach in 1996 would not be a maiden arrival from the Oort cloud , a place where comets with orbital periods of millions of years come from . Comets entering the inner Solar System for the first time may brighten rapidly before fading as they near the Sun , because a layer of highly volatile material evaporates . This was the case with Comet Kohoutek in 1973 ; it was initially touted as potentially spectacular , but only appeared moderately bright . Older comets show a more consistent brightening pattern . Thus , all indications suggested Comet Hyakutake would be bright . 
 Besides approaching close to Earth , the comet would also be visible throughout the night to northern hemisphere observers at its closest approach because of its path , passing very close to the pole star . This would be an unusual occurrence , because most comets are close to the Sun in the sky when the comets are at their brightest , leading to the comets appearing in a sky not completely dark . 
 = = Earth passage = = 
 Hyakutake became visible to the naked eye in early March 1996 . By mid @-@ March , the comet was still fairly unremarkable , shining at 4th magnitude with a tail about 5 degrees long . As it neared its closest approach to Earth , it rapidly became brighter , and its tail grew in length . By March 24 , the comet was one of the brightest objects in the night sky , and its tail stretched 35 degrees . The comet had a notably bluish @-@ green colour . 
 The closest approach occurred on 25 March . Hyakutake was moving so rapidly across the night sky that its movement could be detected against the stars in just a few minutes ; it covered the diameter of a full moon ( half a degree ) every 30 minutes . Observers estimated its magnitude as around 0 , and tail lengths of up to 80 degrees were reported . Its coma , now close to the zenith for observers at mid @-@ northern latitudes , appeared approximately 1 @.@ 5 to 2 degrees across , roughly four times the diameter of the full moon . Even to the naked eye , the comet 's head appeared distinctly green , due to strong emissions from diatomic carbon ( C2 ) . 
 Because Hyakutake was at its brightest for only a few days , it did not have time to permeate the public imagination in the way that Comet Hale – Bopp did the following year . Many European observers in particular did not see the comet at its peak because of unfavourable weather conditions . 
 = = Perihelion and afterwards = = 
 After its close approach to the Earth , the comet faded to about 2nd magnitude . It reached perihelion on 1 May 1996 , brightening again and exhibiting a dust tail in addition to the gas tail seen as it passed the Earth . By this time , however , it was close to the Sun and was not seen as easily . It was observed passing perihelion by the SOHO Sun @-@ observing satellite , which also recorded a large coronal mass ejection being formed at the same time . Its distance from the Sun at perihelion was 0 @.@ 23 AU , well inside the orbit of Mercury . 
 After its perihelion passage , Hyakutake faded rapidly and was lost to naked @-@ eye visibility by the end of May . Its orbital path carried it rapidly into the southern skies , but following perihelion it became much less monitored . The last known observation of the comet took place on November 2 . 
 Hyakutake had passed through the inner Solar System approximately 17 @,@ 000 years ago ; gravitational interactions with the gas giants during its 1996 passage stretched its orbit greatly , and barycentric fits to the comet 's orbit predict it will not return to the inner Solar System again for approximately 70 @,@ 000 years .

 The Ulysses spacecraft made an unexpected pass through the tail of the comet on 1 May 1996 . Evidence of the encounter was not noticed until 1998 . Astronomers analysing old data found that Ulysses ' instruments had detected a large drop in the number of protons passing , as well as a change in the direction and strength of the local magnetic field . This implied that the spacecraft had crossed the ' wake ' of an object , most likely a comet ; the object responsible was not immediately identified . 
 In 2000 , two teams independently analyzed the same event . The magnetometer team realized that the changes in the direction of the magnetic field mentioned above agreed with the " draping " pattern expected in a comet 's ion , or plasma tail . The magnetometer team looked for likely suspects . No known comets were located near the satellite , but looking further afield , they found that Hyakutake , 500 × 10 ^ 6 km ( 3 @.@ 3 AU ) away , had crossed Ulysses ' orbital plane on 23 April 1996 . The solar wind had a velocity at the time of about 750 km / s ( 470 mi / s ) , at which speed it would have taken eight days for the tail to be carried out to where the spacecraft was situated at 3 @.@ 73 AU , approximately 45 degrees out of the ecliptic plane . The orientation of the ion tail inferred from the magnetic field measurements agreed with the source lying in Comet Hyakutake 's orbital plane . 
 The other team , working on data from the spacecraft 's ion composition spectrometer , discovered a sudden large spike in detected levels of ionised particles at the same time . The relative abundances of chemical elements detected indicated that the object responsible was definitely a comet . 
 Based on the Ulysses encounter , the comet 's tail is known to have been at least 570 million km ( 360 million miles ; 3 @.@ 8 AU ) long . This is almost twice as long as the previous longest @-@ known cometary tail , that of the Great Comet of 1843 , which was 2 @.@ 2 AU long . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Terrestrial observers found ethane and methane in the comet , the first time either of these gases had been detected in a comet . Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal , which may imply that its ices formed in interstellar space , away from the Sun , which would have evaporated these volatile molecules . Hyakutake 's ices must have formed at temperatures of 20 K or less , indicating that it probably formed in a denser @-@ than @-@ average interstellar cloud . 
 The amount of deuterium in the comet 's water ices was determined through spectroscopic observations . It was found that the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen ( known as the D / H ratio ) was about 3 × 10 − 4 , which compares to a value in Earth 's oceans of about 1 @.@ 5 × 10 − 4 . It has been proposed that cometary collisions with Earth might have supplied a large proportion of the water in the oceans , but the high D – H ratio measured in Hyakutake and other comets such as Hale – Bopp and Halley 's Comet have caused problems for this theory . 
 = = = X @-@ ray emission = = = 
 One of the great surprises of Hyakutake 's passage through the inner Solar System was the discovery that it was emitting X @-@ rays , with observations made using the ROSAT satellite revealing very strong X @-@ ray emission . This was the first time a comet had been seen to do so , but astronomers soon found that almost every comet they looked at was emitting X @-@ rays . The emission from Hyakutake was brightest in a crescent shape surrounding the nucleus with the ends of the crescent pointing away from the Sun . 
 The cause of the X @-@ ray emission is thought to be a combination of two mechanisms . Interactions between energetic solar wind particles and cometary material evaporating from the nucleus is likely to contribute significantly to this effect . Reflection of solar X @-@ rays is seen in other Solar System objects such as the Moon , but a simple calculation assuming even the highest x @-@ ray reflectivity possible per molecule or dust grain is not able to explain the majority of the observed flux from Hyakutake , as the comet 's atmosphere is very tenuous and diffuse . Observations of comet C / 1999 S4 ( LINEAR ) with the Chandra satellite in 2000 determined that X @-@ rays observed from that comet were produced predominantly by charge exchange collisions between highly charged carbon , oxygen and nitrogen minor ions in the solar wind , and neutral water , oxygen and hydrogen in the comet 's coma . 
 = = = Nucleus size and activity = = = 
 Radar results from the Arecibo Observatory indicated that the comet nucleus was about 4 @.@ 8 km ( 3 @.@ 0 mi ) across , and surrounded by a flurry of pebble @-@ sized particles ejected at a few metres per second . This size measurement corresponded well with indirect estimates using infrared emission and radio observations . 
 The small size of the nucleus ( Halley 's Comet is about 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) across , while Comet Hale – Bopp was about 60 km ( 37 mi ) across ) implies that Hyakutake must have been very active to become as bright as it did . Most comets undergo outgassing from a small proportion of their surface , but most or all of Hyakutake 's surface seemed to have been active . The dust production rate was estimated to be about 2 × 103 kg / s at the beginning of March , rising to 3 × 104 kg / s as the comet approached perihelion . During the same period , dust ejection velocities increased from 50 m / s to 500 m / s . 
 Observations of material being ejected from the nucleus allowed astronomers to establish its rotation period . As the comet passed the Earth , a large puff or blob of material was observed being ejected in the <unk> direction every 6 @.@ 23 hours . A second smaller ejection with the same period confirmed this as the rotation period of the nucleus . 
 = 2000 Canadian Grand Prix = 
 The 2000 Canadian Grand Prix ( formally the <unk> Grand Prix Air Canada ) was a Formula One motor race held on 18 June 2000 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve , Montreal , Canada . It was the seventh round of the 2000 Formula One season and the 38th Canadian Grand Prix . The 69 @-@ lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher after starting from pole position . His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second with Giancarlo Fisichella third for the Benetton team . 
 Michael Schumacher started from pole position alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard . Barrichello began from third , alongside Coulthard 's teammate Mika Häkkinen . The front two of Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled for first place until Coulthard served a ten @-@ second stop @-@ go penalty on lap 14 as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began . Just before half distance , Michael Schumacher made an early pit stop allowing Barrichello to take the lead until his own pit stop on lap 43 . By this time rain began to fall causing drivers to make the switch to wet @-@ weather tyres . Michael Schumacher retained his lead throughout and took the victory 0 @.@ 1 seconds ahead of Barrichello . 
 The victory was Michael Schumacher 's fifth of the season , his fourth at the circuit , and the result meant that he extended his lead in the Drivers ' Championship to twenty @-@ two points in front Coulthard , with Häkkinen a further two points behind . Ferrari also extended their lead in the Constructors ' Championship , eighteen points ahead of McLaren . Benetton , on 18 points , pushed their rivals Williams down to fourth place , with nine races of the season remaining .

 The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams , each of two drivers . The teams , also known as constructors , were McLaren , Ferrari , Jordan , Jaguar , Williams , Benetton , Prost , Sauber , Arrows , Minardi and BAR . Tyre supplier Bridgestone brought two different tyre types to the race ; the Soft and the Medium dry compounds . 
 Going into the race , Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers ' Championship with 46 points , ahead of David Coulthard on 34 points and his teammate Mika Häkkinen on 29 points . Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 22 points and Giancarlo Fisichella was fifth on 14 points . In the Constructors ' Championship Ferrari were leading with 68 points ahead of their rivals McLaren on 63 points . Williams with 15 points and Benetton on 14 contended for third place and Jordan were fifth on 9 points . Ferrari and McLaren had so far dominated the championship , winning the previous seven races . Championship participants Barrichello and Fisichella had each gained second place podium finishes while Ralf Schumacher and Heinz @-@ Harald Frentzen had both achieved third place podium finishes . 
 In the weeks leading up to the event , the Société de Transport de la Communauté Urbaine De Montréal ( STCUM ) announced that they would held strikes over pension fund contributions during the Grand Prix weekend . STCUM chose those dates due to the event 's high profile status as public transport was classified as an essential service over the weekend . It would also result in the road leading to the circuit being blocked off to spectators . STCUM appeared before Essential Services Council on 9 June to discuss producing a contingency plan to ensure spectators would attend the Grand Prix with full services running . An agreement was reached on 13 June with 60 % of transport workers voting in favour of improved pay and pension , allowing the race to go unaffected . 
 Following the Monaco Grand Prix on 4 June , the teams conducted testing sessions at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 6 – 8 June to prepare for the Canadian Grand Prix . Barrichello set the first day 's fastest times , ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis . Testing was halted when Nick Heidfeld and Luciano Burti both experienced engine and electronic failures respectively . Häkkinen was fastest on the second day . BAR 's Ricardo Zonta lost control of his car and crashed into the barriers at the Parabolica corner , limiting his testing time as repairs were made to his car . Jenson Button for Williams was quickest on the third day . Ferrari undertook additional testing at their private facility , the Fiorano Circuit , with their test driver Luca Badoer who performed practice pit stops and starts , utilising different car set @-@ ups , testing new car components and ran on an artificially wet track . 
 Ralf Schumacher was passed fit in the days leading up to the race . At the previous race , he had suffered a serious crash at the Sainte Devote corner and he sustained a three @-@ inch gash on his left <unk> which required stitches . The Williams team had their test driver Bruno Junqueira ready to replace Ralf Schumacher should the latter have been not ready to race . Ralf Schumacher said that he would decide after the event 's first free practice sessions whether he would compete .

 Saturday 's afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour . Each driver was limited to twelve laps , with the grid order decided by the drivers ' fastest laps . During this session , the 107 % rule was in effect , which necessitated each driver set a time within 107 % of the quickest lap to qualify for the race . The session was held in dry and sunny conditions ; the air temperature ranged between 23 – 24 ° C ( 73 – 75 ° F ) and the track temperature was between 23 – 29 ° C ( 73 – 84 ° F ) . Michael Schumacher clinched his third pole position of the season , his fifth at the circuit , with a time of 1 : 18 @.@ 439 . He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard who qualified 0 @.@ 098 seconds behind Michael Schumacher 's time having battled the Ferrari driver for grid position throughout the session . Barrichello qualifed in 3rd position and was happy with his Ferrari . Häkkinen encountered traffic during his qualifying runs and managed fourth .

The McLaren drivers rounded out the top four fastest drivers ; Häkkinen in front of Coulthard . Amongst the slower runners , Heidfeld had a worrying moment when his engine cover was shed from the chassis on the main straight . 
 The race started at 14 : 00 local time . The conditions on the grid were dry and cloudy before the race . The air temperature was 17 ° C ( 63 ° F ) and the track temperature 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) . Coulthard 's McLaren stalled as the drivers began the formation lap . His team 's mechanics restarted his car and Coulthard took his grid position before the entire field passed him . Coulthard accelerated faster than Michael Schumacher off the line though the Ferrari driver defended his position going into the first corner . Häkkinen , meanwhile , withstood Barrichello 's attempts to pass him for third . Villeneuve made the best start in the field moving from 6th to 3rd at the end of the first lap , while Verstappen made up the same number of . Häkkinen was forced wide by Villeneuve 's manoeuvre and Barrichello passed him for fourth position into turn 2 .

 The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference . Michael Schumacher revealed that his early pit stop was down to a possible sensor failure which caused his team to receive misinformation . He also added that the wet @-@ weather conditions forced him to change the entire brake balance towards the front of his car . Barrichello said that he informed Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn that it would be quicker to make an extra pit stop had it rained for ten more laps . Nevertheless , he stated that he trusted his team in their judgement and revealed his car developed an clutch issue during the Grand Prix . Fisichella stated that he was driving a conservative race as he was on a one @-@ stop strategy . Additionally , he praised the team for their achieving a continued run of consistent podium position finishes at the circuit . 
 Häkkinen said that his race was " over " when the rain started to fall having not managing to achieve a higher finishing position . Jos Verstappen scored points for the first time since the 1996 Argentine Grand Prix . Verstappen said that was pleased with the result and praised his team for switching to wet tyres as he kept in contact with his mechanics . Trulli remarked that he had " never had to work so hard for one point " after the amount of pressure he came under in the race . Coulthard said that he lost the chance of victory when he stalled his car and admitted it was his mistake . On the other hand , he criticised his penalty as Coulthard believed that the race stewards should have been given more freedom by Formula One 's governing body , the FIA , to decide whether a driver gained an advantage . After the race , Villeneuve and Diniz were penalised 25 seconds – which were added to their total race times – for their collisions with Diniz and de la Rosa respectively . 
 The result of the race meant Michael Schumacher extended his points tally in the Drivers ' Championship to 56 points , twenty @-@ two in front of second @-@ placed Coulthard . Häkkinen remained in third position , two points behind his teammate , while Barrichello in fourth reduced Häkkinen 's point advantage to four points . Fisichella 's third @-@ place finish saw him retain fifth on 18 points . In the Constructors ' Championship , Ferrari 's one @-@ two result saw them extend their advantage over McLaren to eighteen points . Benetton moved in front of their rivals Williams for third , while BAR retained fifth position , with nine races of the season remaining . Despite the extended points advantage that Michael Schumacher and Ferrari had , Coulthard maintained his view that his main rivals could be caught in the season 's nine remaining races saying " There 's still a long way to go in the championship and anything can happen .

 = Ace Attorney Investigations : Miles Edgeworth = 
 Ace Attorney Investigations : Miles Edgeworth , known in Japan as Gyakuten Kenji ( Japanese : <unk> , lit . " Turnabout Prosecutor " ) , is a 2009 single @-@ player adventure video game developed by Capcom for the handheld video game console Nintendo DS . It was published in Japan on May 28 , 2009 , and in North America , Australia , and Europe , in February , 2010 . It is the fifth game in the Ace Attorney series , and is set between the events of the third and fourth games , Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney − Trials and Tribulations and Apollo Justice : Ace Attorney . 
 While previous games in the series focus on defense attorneys , Ace Attorney Investigations has the player control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth , who investigates five cases that tie together to form an overarching story about a smuggling ring . The game consists of investigation phases , in which the player investigates crime scenes in search for evidence , and rebuttal phases , in which they confront other characters , to hear what they think has happened ; the player is able to use evidence to find contradictions in the characters ' statements , to get closer to the truth . 
 The game was directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro . Eshiro had come up with the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations , and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation . The game was specifically designed to be different from previous Ace Attorney titles , with a larger focus on the environment . The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye , a character from earlier games in the series , as the lead character , but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity . They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth , as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games , where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters ; to do this , they included direct control of Edgeworth , and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts . 
 It was met by generally favorable reviews , with a common complaint being that rebuttals at times devolve into trial and error . The game was one of the best selling games of 2009 in Japan , while Western sales were described as " poor at best " . After the game 's release , a manga series based on it has been released . A sequel , Ace Attorney Investigations 2 , was released in 2011 ; it has not been released officially outside Japan , but a fan translation of it has been made . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Ace Attorney Investigations is a single @-@ player adventure game in which players control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth , who investigates five cases . The game is mostly presented from a third @-@ person perspective , occasionally switching to a first @-@ person view when examining evidence . Each case involves playing through several investigation phases and rebuttal phases . 
 During investigation phases , players control Edgeworth directly , either with the D @-@ pad , or by sliding the map that is displayed on the bottom screen . The player has Edgeworth walk around crime scenes in search for evidence ; they also meet witnesses and suspects during these phases , who they can talk to . As Edgeworth notices various things in the crime scene , they are saved as Edgeworth 's thoughts . Using the " logic " function , the player can connect two such thoughts to gain new information ; for instance , by connecting two bullet holes with a gun that has only been fired once , Edgeworth will conclude that two guns must have been at the crime scene . At some points , the player is able to control a cursor to examine parts of the crime scene ; by using the " deduction " function at these points , the player is able to point out a contradiction between the crime scene and evidence . If the player successfully points out a contradiction , they gain access to new information . At certain points , a device called Little Thief can be used to create hologram reproductions of the crime scene ; by investigating these reproductions , the player can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden . As more evidence is uncovered , the hologram is updated . After having examined an area sufficiently , the investigation phase ends , and the game moves on to a rebuttal phase . 
 In the rebuttal phases , a witness or a rival character provides their idea of what has happened . The player is able to press them for details , and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying . By doing this , the player gets closer to the truth ; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases . Upon solving a case , the episode is cleared and a new episode is made available to the player . If the player makes mistakes throughout the game , such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence , attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up , or making incorrect choices , a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases , representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth . If it is completely emptied , the game ends . By clearing an investigation phase , half of the gauge is restored , and by clearing an episode , the gauge is restored completely .
