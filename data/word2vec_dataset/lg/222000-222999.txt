 Before starting a book Wodehouse would write up to four hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot ; he acknowledged that " It 's the plots that I find so hard to work out . It takes such a long time to work one out . " He always completed the plot before working on specific character actions . For a novel the note @-@ writing process could take up to two years , and he would usually have two or more novels in preparation simultaneously . After he had completed his notes , he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty thousand words , which ensured plot holes were avoided , and allowed for the dialogue to begin to develop . When interviewed in 1975 he revealed that " For a humorous novel you 've got to have a scenario , and you 've got to test it so that you know where the comedy comes in , where the situations come in ... splitting it up into scenes ( you can make a scene of almost anything ) and have as little stuff in between as possible . " He preferred working between 4 and 7 pm — but never after dinner — and would work seven days a week . In his younger years , he would write around two to three thousand words a day , although he slowed as he aged , so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand . The reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books : when younger he would produce a novel in about three months , while Bachelors Anonymous , published in 1973 , took around six months . 
 Wodehouse believed that one of the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life , and he stated that " If you take life fairly easily , then you take a humorous view of things . It 's probably because you were born that way . " He carried this view through into his writing , describing the approach as " making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music , and ignoring real life altogether " . The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse 's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings . Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible , correcting and refining the prose as he wrote , and would then make another good copy , before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher . 
 Most of Wodehouse 's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s . The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse 's novels , such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle , as " a fairyland " . Although some critics thought Wodehouse 's fiction was based on a world that had never existed , Wodehouse affirmed that " it did . It was going strong between the wars " , although he agreed that his version was to some extent " a sort of artificial world of my own creation " . The novels showed a largely unchanging world , regardless of when they were written , and only rarely — and mistakenly in McCrum 's view — did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude , as he did in the 1966 story " Bingo Bans the Bomb " . 
 When dealing with the dialogue in his novels , Wodehouse would consider the book 's characters as if they were actors in a play , ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline , which must be strong : " If they aren 't in interesting situations , characters can 't be major characters , not even if you have the rest of the troop talk their heads off about them . " Many of Wodehouse 's parts were stereotypes , and he acknowledged that " a real character in one of my books sticks out like a sore thumb . " The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature , and therefore " shares with [ Charles ] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject " . 
 Much of Wodehouse 's use of slang terms reflects the influence of his time at school in Dulwich , and partly reflects Edwardian slang . As a young man he enjoyed the literary works of Arthur Conan Doyle and Jerome K. Jerome , and the operatic works of Gilbert and Sullivan . Wodehouse quotes from and alludes to numerous poets throughout his work . The scholar Clarke Olney lists those quoted , including Milton , Byron , Longfellow , Coleridge , Swinburne , Tennyson , Wordsworth and Shakespeare .

 In 1941 the Concise Cambridge History of English Literature opined that Wodehouse had " a gift for highly original aptness of phrase that almost suggests a poet struggling for release among the wild extravagances of farce " , while McCrum thinks that Wodehouse manages to combine " high farce with the inverted poetry of his mature comic style " , particularly in The Code of the <unk> ; the novelist Anthony Powell believes Wodehouse to be a " comic poet " . Robert A. Hall , Jr . , in his study of Wodehouse 's style and technique , describes the author as a master of prose , an opinion also shared by Levin , who considers Wodehouse " one of the finest and purest writers of English prose " . Hall identifies several techniques used by Wodehouse to achieve comic effect , including the creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes , so when Pongo <unk> removes the housemaid Elsie Bean from a cupboard , Wodehouse writes that the character " de @-@ <unk> the cupboard " . Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two , thus Wodehouse divides " <unk> " when he writes : " To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not <unk> . Nor , when you light it for her , does that constitute <unk> . " 
 Richard Voorhees , Wodehouse 's biographer , believes that the author used clichés in a deliberate and ironic manner . His opinion is shared by the academic Stephen Medcalf , who deems Wodehouse 's skill is to " bring a cliché just enough to life to kill it " , although Pamela March , writing in The Christian Science Monitor , considers Wodehouse to have " an ability to <unk> a cliché " . Medcalf provides an example from Right Ho , Jeeves in which the teetotal Gussie Fink @-@ <unk> has surreptitiously been given whisky and gin in a punch prior to a prize @-@ giving : 
 The stylistic device most commonly found in Wodehouse 's work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes . Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse 's ability to accentuate " resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous " . Examples can be seen in Joy in the Morning , Chapter 29 : " There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside . Jeeves sailing into action " , or Psmith , Chapter 7 : " A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily in the middle of a thunderstorm interrupted his meditation . " Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a transferred epithet , with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object . The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms , only once or twice in a story or novel , according to Hall . 
 Wordplay is a key element in Wodehouse 's writing . This can take the form of puns , such as in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit , when Bertie is released after a night in the police cells , and says that he has " a pinched look " about him . Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism , such as in Uncle Dynamite when Constable Potter says he has been " assaulted by the duck pond . " In reply , Sir Aylmer , confusing the two meanings of the word " by " , asks : " How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond ? " Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour . Some come through exaggeration , such as Bingo Little 's infant child who " not only has the aspect of a mass murderer , but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail " , or Wooster 's complaint that " the <unk> that Bobbie Wickham is already starting may be amusing to her , but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup . " Bertie Wooster 's half @-@ forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device . In Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit Bertie asks Jeeves " Let a <unk> like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh , and you are inviting disaster and ... what 's the word ? Something about cats . " Jeeves replies , " <unk> , sir ? " 
 = = Reception and reputation = = 
 Wodehouse 's early career as a lyricist and playwright was profitable , and his work with Bolton , according to The Guardian , " was one of the most successful in the history of musical comedy " . At the outbreak of the Second World War he was earning £ 40 @,@ 000 a year from his work , which had broadened to include novels and short stories . Following the furore ensuing from the wartime broadcasts , he suffered a downturn in his popularity and book sales ; The Saturday Evening Post stopped publishing his short stories , a stance they reversed in 1965 , although his popularity — and the sales figures — slowly recovered over time . 
 Wodehouse received great praise from many of his contemporaries , including Max Beerbohm , Rudyard Kipling , A.E. Housman and Evelyn Waugh — the last of whom opines : " One has to regard a man as a Master who can produce on average three uniquely brilliant and entirely original similes on each page . " There are dissenters to the praise . The writer Alan Bennett thinks that " inspired though his language is , I can never take more than ten pages of the novels at a time , their relentless flippancy wearing and tedious " , while the literary critic F.R. Leavis writes that Wodehouse had a " stereotyped humour ... of ingenious variations on a laugh in one place " . In a 2010 study of Wodehouse 's few relatively serious novels , such as The Coming of Bill ( 1919 ) , Jill the Reckless ( 1920 ) and The Adventures of Sally ( 1922 ) , David <unk> concludes that though their literary quality does not match that of the farcical novels , they show a range of empathy and interests that in real life — and in his most comic works — the author seemed to lack . " Never oblivious to grief and despair , he opts in clear @-@ eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly @-@ headed peers . It 's an austere , almost bloodless preference for pristine artifice over the pain and messy outcomes of actual existence , but it 's a case of Wodehouse keeping faith with his own unique art . " 
 The American literary analyst Robert F. Kiernan , defining " camp " as " excessive stylization of whatever kind " , brackets Wodehouse as " a master of the camp novel " , along with Thomas Love Peacock , Max Beerbohm , Ronald Firbank , E. F. Benson and Ivy Compton @-@ Burnett . The literary critic and writer Cyril Connolly calls Wodehouse a " politicians ' author " — one who does " not like art to be exacting and difficult " . Two former British prime ministers , H. H. Asquith and Tony Blair , are on record as Wodehouse aficionados , and the latter became a patron of the Wodehouse Society . Seán O 'Casey , a successful playwright of the 1920s , thought little of Wodehouse : he commented in 1941 that it was damaging to England 's dignity that the public or " the academic government of Oxford , dead from the chin up " considered Wodehouse an important figure in English literature . His jibe that Wodehouse was " English literature 's performing flea " provided his target with the title of his collected letters , published in 1953 . 
 The proposed nominations of Wodehouse for a knighthood in 1967 and 1971 were blocked for fear that such an award would " give currency to a Bertie Wooster image of the British character which the embassy was doing its best to eradicate " . When Wodehouse was awarded the knighthood , only four years later , the journalist Dennis Barker wrote in The Guardian that the writer was " the solitary surviving English literary comic genius " . After his death six weeks later , the journalist Michael Davie , writing in the same paper , observed that " Many people regarded ... [ Wodehouse ] as he regarded Beachcomber , as ' one , if not more than one , of England 's greatest men ' " , while in the view of the obituarist for The Times Wodehouse " was a comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce " . 
 Since Wodehouse 's death there have been numerous adaptations and dramatisations of his work on television and film , and , as of 2015 , the Oxford English Dictionary contains over 1 @,@ 750 quotations from Wodehouse , illustrating terms from <unk> to <unk> . McCrum , writing in 2004 , observes , " Wodehouse is more popular today than on the day he died " , and " his comic vision has an absolutely secure place in the English literary imagination . " Voorhees , while acknowledging that Wodehouse 's antecedents in literature range from Ben Jonson to Oscar Wilde , writes : 
 " [ I ] t is now abundantly clear that Wodehouse is one of the funniest and most productive men who ever wrote in English . He is far from being a mere <unk> : he is an authentic craftsman , a wit and humorist of the first water , the inventor of a prose style which is a kind of comic poetry . " 
 = Eckhart Tolle = 
 Eckhart Tolle ( / <unk> <unk> / EK @-@ art <unk> @-@ ə ; German pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] , born Ulrich Leonard <unk> , February 16 , 1948 ) is a German @-@ born resident of Canada , best known as the author of The Power of Now and A New Earth : Awakening to your Life 's Purpose . In 2011 , he was listed by Watkins Review as the most spiritually influential person in the world . In 2008 , a New York Times writer called Tolle " the most popular spiritual author in the United States " . 
 Tolle has said that he was depressed for much of his life until he underwent , at age 29 , an " inner transformation " . He then spent several years wandering " in a state of deep bliss " before becoming a spiritual teacher . Later , he moved to North America where he began writing his first book , The Power of Now , which was published in 1997 and reached the New York Times Best Seller lists in 2000 . 
 The Power of Now and A New Earth sold an estimated three million and five million copies respectively in North America by 2009 . In 2008 , approximately 35 million people participated in a series of 10 live <unk> with Tolle and television talk show host Oprah Winfrey . Tolle is not identified with any particular religion , but he has been influenced by a wide range of spiritual works . He has lived in Vancouver , British Columbia since 1995 . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Born Ulrich Leonard <unk> in <unk> , a small town located north of Dortmund in the Ruhr Valley , Germany in 1948 , Tolle describes his childhood as unhappy , particularly his early childhood in Germany . His parents fought and eventually separated , and he felt alienated from a hostile school environment . Tolle also experienced considerable fear and anxiety growing up in post @-@ war Germany , where he would play in bombed @-@ out buildings . He later stated that pain " was in the energy field of the country " . At the age of 13 , he moved to Spain to live with his father . Tolle 's father did not insist that his son attend high school , so Tolle elected to study literature , astronomy and various languages at home . 
 At the age of 15 , Tolle read several books written by the German mystic Joseph Anton <unk> , also known as <unk> Yin <unk> . Tolle has said he responded " very deeply " to those books . 
 At the age of 19 , about 10 years before his " inner transformation " , Tolle moved to England and for three years taught German and Spanish at a London school for language studies . Troubled by " depression , anxiety and fear " , he began " searching for answers " in his life . 
 In his early twenties , Tolle decided to pursue his search by studying philosophy , psychology , and literature , and enrolled in the University of London . After graduating , he was offered a scholarship to do postgraduate research at Cambridge University , which he began in 1977 , and from which he dropped out soon after . 
 = = Inner transformation = = 
 One night in 1977 , at the age of 29 , after having suffered from long periods of depression , Tolle says he experienced an " inner transformation " . That night he awakened from his sleep , suffering from feelings of depression that were " almost unbearable , " but then experienced a life @-@ changing epiphany . Recounting the experience , Tolle says , 
 I couldn ’ t live with myself any longer . And in this a question arose without an answer : who is the ‘ I ’ that cannot live with the self ? What is the self ? I felt drawn into a void ! I didn ’ t know at the time that what really happened was the mind @-@ made self , with its heaviness , its problems , that lives between the unsatisfying past and the fearful future , collapsed . It dissolved . The next morning I woke up and everything was so peaceful . The peace was there because there was no self . Just a sense of presence or “ <unk> , ” just observing and watching . 
 Tolle recalls going out for a walk in London the next morning , and finding that “ everything was miraculous , deeply peaceful . Even the traffic . " The feeling continued , and he began to feel a strong underlying sense of peace in any situation . Tolle stopped studying for his doctorate , and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting , “ in a state of deep bliss , " on park benches in Russell Square , Central London , " watching the world go by . ” He stayed with friends , in a Buddhist monastery , or otherwise slept rough on Hampstead Heath . His family thought him “ irresponsible , even insane . " Tolle changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart ; by some reports this was in homage to the German philosopher and mystic , Meister Eckhart . A 2012 interview article states that he saw the name Eckhart on one of a pile of books in a dream , and knew he had written the book ; soon after in real life he ran into a psychic friend who called him Eckhart out of nowhere , so Tolle changed his name . 
 = = Career = = 
 After this period , former Cambridge students and people he had met by chance began to ask Tolle about his beliefs . He began working as a counselor and spiritual teacher . Students continued to come to him over the next five years . He relocated to Glastonbury , a major centre of alternative living . In 1995 , after having visited the West Coast of North America several times , he settled in Vancouver , British Columbia , where he met his wife to be , Kim Eng . 
 Tolle 's first book , The Power of Now , was first published in 1997 by Namaste Publishing . Only 3000 copies were published of the first edition . Tolle has stated , " I would personally deliver a few copies every week to some small bookstores in Vancouver ... Friends helped by placing copies of the book in spiritual bookstores farther afield " . The book was republished on a large scale by New World Library in 1999 . In 2000 , Oprah Winfrey recommended it in her magazine , O. In August 2000 it reached the New York Times Best Seller list for Hardcover Advice . After two more years , it was number one on that list . By 2008 , the book had been translated from English into 33 languages ; since then , it has been translated into Arabic . Tolle published his second book , Stillness Speaks , in 2003 . In July 2011 , The Power of Now appeared on the list for the 10 best selling Paperback Advice books for the 102nd time . 
 In 2005 , Tolle published his third book , A New Earth , which assumed the number one position on the New York Times Best Seller list several times between March and September 2008 . By the end of 2008 , it reached the list for the 46th time . The high sales of A New Earth in that year followed its selection by Oprah Winfrey for her book club in January . In the four weeks following the announcement , 3 @.@ 5 million copies of the book were shipped . Tolle partnered with her to produce a series of webinar sessions beginning in May 2008 . The weekly webinar sessions included discussions between Tolle and Winfrey , silent meditations , and questions from viewers via Skype . Each webinar focused on a specific chapter of A New Earth . The third webinar attracted more than 11 million viewers . 
 Tolle formed a company to sell products related to his teachings called Eckhart Teachings . He created a website called Eckhart Tolle TV , with streaming video of monthly group meditations and other videos . He gives speeches and workshops in English and occasionally in German or Spanish . He also travels for various speaking engagements , such as seminars and retreats . In a 2003 interview with the Telegraph Magazine , Tolle indicated that he had no intention of creating " a heavy commercial structure " , nor of setting up an ashram or centre . He believes one " could develop organically " and said " one needs to be careful that the organization doesn ’ t become self @-@ serving " . 
 In September , he appeared with the Dalai Lama and other speakers at the Vancouver Peace Summit . His most recent book , Guardians of Being , is a picture book illustrated by Patrick McDonnell , the creator of the comic strip Mutts . 
 = = Teachings = = 
 Tolle writes in the introduction to his second book , Stillness Speaks : 
 " A true spiritual teacher does not have anything to teach in the conventional sense of the word , does not have anything to give or add to you , such as new information , beliefs , or rules of conduct . The only function of such a teacher is to help you remove that which separates you from the truth ... The words are no more than signposts . " 
 Tolle says that his book , The Power of Now , is " a restatement for our time of that one timeless spiritual teaching , the essence of all religions " . He writes that religions " have become so overlaid with extraneous matter that their spiritual substance has become almost completely obscured " , that they have become " to a large extent ... divisive rather than unifying forces " and become " themselves part of the insanity " . 
 Tolle writes that " the most significant thing that can happen to a human being [ is ] the separation process of thinking and awareness " and that awareness is " the space in which thoughts exist " . Tolle says that " the primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it " . 
 According to Tolle 's official website , " at the core of Tolle 's teachings lies the transformation of consciousness , a spiritual awakening that he sees as the next step in human evolution . An essential aspect of this awakening consists in transcending our ego @-@ based state of consciousness . This is a prerequisite not only for personal happiness but also for the ending of violent conflict endemic on our planet " . 
 In his book A New Earth , Tolle describes a major aspect of the human dysfunction as " ego " or an " illusory sense of self " based on unconscious identification with one 's memories and thoughts , and another major aspect he calls " pain @-@ body " or " an accumulation of old emotional pain " . 
 Tolle often talks about the relevance of figures in intellectual or popular culture . In A New Earth , he quotes Descartes , Sartre , Nietzsche , Shakespeare and Albert Einstein . He has spoken of movies such as Groundhog Day , American Beauty , The Horse Whisperer , Gran Torino , Titanic , Avatar , Being There , and Forrest Gump , and musicians such as Mozart , The Beatles and The Rolling Stones . He arranged an album of music in 2008 entitled Music to Quiet the Mind including work composed by Erik Satie , Claude Debussy and The Beatles , and music by contemporary artists such as Deva <unk> , Jeff Johnson , and Steve Roach . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 According to a 2009 article in the New York Times , Tolle is " not identified with any religion , but uses teachings from Zen Buddhism , Sufism , Hinduism and the Bible " . Tolle has said : " I feel actually that the work I do is a coming together of the teaching ' stream ' , if you want to call it that , of [ Jiddu ] Krishnamurti and Ramana Maharshi . " Tolle himself has mentioned texts such as the Tao Te Ching , the Bhagavad Gita and other Hindu scriptures , the Buddhist scriptures , the Old Testament , the New Testament , and A Course in Miracles ; he has mentioned various individuals such as Zoroaster , Lao Tzu , Mahavira , Gautama Buddha , Heraclitus , Parmenides , Jesus , Epictetus , Marcus Aurelius , Rumi , Meister Eckhart , Hafiz , <unk> <unk> , Ralph Waldo Emerson , Carl Gustav Jung ; and he has emphasized the mystical schools within religions such as Gnosticism in Christianity , Sufism in Islam , Hasidism and <unk> in Judaism , Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism , and Zen and <unk> in Buddhism . He has met and spoken with Barry Long and Don Miguel Ruiz , and he wrote a foreword for The Diamond in Your Pocket by <unk> .

 In 2008 , an article in the New York Times referred to Tolle as " the most popular spiritual author in the [ United States ] " . In 2011 , the Watkins Review put him at number 1 in a list of " The 100 Most <unk> Influential Living People " . By 2009 , total sales of The Power of Now and A New Earth in North America had been estimated at three million and five million copies respectively . 
 The books have received a wide range of praise and criticism . One book reviewer characterized The Power of Now as " awash in spiritual mumbo @-@ jumbo " , while another reviewer wrote , " Tolle 's clear writing and the obvious depth of his experience and insight set it apart " . 
 Some critics characterize Tolle 's books as unoriginal or derivative . A 2009 New York Times article said he is " hardly the first writer to tap into the American longing for meaning and success " . Sara Nelson , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Publishers Weekly , said Tolle 's writings have been successful due to surging public interest in books that tell you how to be happier , more peaceful and more successful . James Robinson in The Observer called Tolle 's writings " a mix of pseudo @-@ science , New Age philosophy , and teaching borrowed from established religions " . 
 However , others praise his re @-@ working and synthesis of traditions . New Age writer William Bloom wrote that " Tolle is offering a very contemporary synthesis of Eastern spiritual teaching , which is normally so clothed in arcane language that it is incomprehensible " , thereby providing " a valuable perspective on Western culture " . Publisher Judith Kendra says , " The ideas [ that Tolle is ] talking about have been in existence for thousands of years in both Eastern texts and with the great Western mystics , but he 's able to make them understandable " . Musician Annie Lennox said " [ Tolle ] has some kind of special quality that I 've never encountered before " . 
 = = = = Reception by Christian theologians = = = = 
 Some Christian scholars criticize Tolle 's teachings , while others praise them . 
 James Beverley , Professor of Christian Thought and Ethics at evangelical Tyndale Seminary in Toronto , says that Tolle 's worldview " is at odds with central Christian convictions " and that " Tolle denies the core of Christianity by claiming there is no ultimate distinction between humans and God and Jesus " . John Stackhouse , a professor of theology and culture at evangelical Regent College in Vancouver , says that Tolle " gives a certain segment of the population exactly what they want : a sort of supreme religion that purports to draw from all sorts of lesser , that is , established religions " . Stackhouse has described Tolle as one of several spiritual teachers who " purport to have investigated the world ’ s religions ( quite a claim ) and found them wanting , who routinely subject those religions to withering criticism , and who then champion their own views as superior to all these alternatives " . 
 In 2008 The Independent noted that " Tolle does have fans in academic , even Christian , circles " . Theologian Andrew Ryder wrote that " Tolle 's writing is based on his own experience and personal reflection . This makes his approach to the challenge of living in the present moment both practical and fresh " even though " he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality " . 
 Stafford Betty , teacher for Religious Studies at <unk> finds common ground between Tolle 's worldview and that of Christian mystics . He notes that " one of the key elements in Tolle 's teaching is that deep within the mind is absolute stillness in which one can experience ' the joy of Being ' " . Betty says that such a view is comparable to the view of contemporary Catholic monk Thomas Keating who wrote that " We rarely think of the air we breathe , yet it is in us and around us all the time . In similar fashion , the presence of God penetrates us , is all around us , is always embracing us , and it is delightful " . Betty also says that " for Mr. Tolle , God is in the world in a more radical way than for the Christian " and that Tolle 's theology " is only a footnote to the therapy he holds out to his audience " . 
 Roman Catholic priest and theologian Richard Rohr credits Tolle for helping to reintroduce ancient Christian mysticism to modern Christians : " Tolle is , in fact , rather brilliantly bringing to our awareness the older tradition ... [ which is ] both the ground and the process for breaking through to the theological contemplation of God , and acquired contemplation of Jesus , the Gospels , and all spiritual things . He is teaching process , not doctrine or dogma . He is teaching how to see and be present , not what you should see when you are present . Tolle is our friend , and not an enemy of the Gospel . There should be no conflict for a mature Christian . " 
 Anglican bishop Michael Ingham has said : " I don 't have any criticism of his message . I think the proper attitude to take with new spiritual movements is one of wait and see . "

 = Ilaiyaraaja = 
 Ilaiyaraaja ( born <unk> ) is an Indian film composer who works in the South Indian cinema but predominantly in Tamil since the late 1970s . Regarded as one of the finest music composers in India , Ilaiyaraaja is also an instrumentalist , conductor , singer , and songwriter . He has composed more than 6000 songs and provided film scores for more than 1000 films , particularly being acclaimed for his background scores . 
 Legendary singers S. P. Balasubrahmanyam , K. S. Chithra and S. Janaki have sung more of his songs than any other singers . He integrated folk — in Tamil — and introduced western musical sensibilities into the South Indian musical mainstream . Ilaiyaraja is also known for creating music by fusing symphonic orchestration with traditional Indian instrumentation , often performed by Budapest Symphony Orchestra . In 1993 he organised a full symphony performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London and thus became the First Indian to compose a full symphony , with Ravi Shankar being the only other Indian to do so . He is also the first Asian to compose a full symphony performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra . He has won five Indian National Film Awards ( the highest film honor in India ) ; three for Best Music Direction and two for Best Background Score . In 2010 he has received Padma Bhushan , awarded by the Government of India . 
 In the 2000s , he composed a variety of non @-@ film music , including religious and devotional songs , an oratorio , and world music . He is usually referred to by the title <unk> ( English : Musical Genius ) , or as The Maestro . Ilaiyaraja is a gold medalist in classical guitar from Trinity College of Music , London . In 2003 , according to an international poll conducted by BBC , people from 155 countries voted his composition <unk> Kaiya <unk> from the 1991 film Thalapathi as fourth in the world 's top 10 most popular songs of all time . He was also nominated in the Best Indian album Music Awards category at US based Just Plain Folks Music Organization , which is the largest grassroots music organization in the world , and stood third for his " Music Journey : Live in Italy " . In 2012 he received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for his creative and experimental works in music field .

 Ilaiyaraaja was born as <unk> in 1943 in a normal middle @-@ class family in <unk> , Theni district , Tamil Nadu , India . When he joined the school his father changed his name as " <unk> " but his village people used to call him as " <unk> " . Ilaiyaraaja joined <unk> Master as a student to learn musical instruments and the master renamed and called him as just " <unk> " . In his first movie Annakili , Tamil film producer Panchu Arunachalam added " <unk> " ( <unk> means younger in Tamil language ) as prefix in his name <unk> and he named as " Ilaiyaraaja " because in the 1970s there was one more music director A. M. Rajah who was a popular one . 
 Ilaiyaraaja was married to Jeeva and the couple have three children — Karthik Raja , Yuvan Shankar Raja and <unk> — all film composers and singers . His wife Jeeva died on 31 October 2011 . Ilaiyaraaja has a brother Gangai Amaran , who is also a music director and lyricist in Tamil film industry .

 Ilaiyaraaja grew up in a rural area , exposed to a range of Tamil folk music . At the age of 14 , he joined a travelling musical troupe headed by his elder brother , Pavalar Varadarajan , and spent the next decade performing throughout South India . While working with the troupe , he penned his first composition , a musical adaptation of an elegy written by the Tamil poet laureate Kannadasan for Jawaharlal Nehru , India 's first prime minister . In 1968 , Ilaiyaraaja began a music course with Professor <unk> in Madras ( now Chennai ) , which included an overview of Western classical music , compositional training in techniques such as counterpoint , and study in instrumental performance . Ilaiyaraaja specialized in classical guitar and had taken a course in it at the Trinity College of Music , London .

 In the 1970s in Chennai , Ilaiyaraaja played guitar in a band @-@ for @-@ hire , and worked as a session guitarist , keyboardist , and organist for film music composers and directors such as Salil Chowdhury from West Bengal . After being hired as the musical assistant to Kannada film composer G. K. Venkatesh , he worked on 200 film projects , mostly in Kannada cinema . As G. K. Venkatesh 's assistant , Ilaiyaraaja would orchestrate the melodic outlines developed by Venkatesh . During this period , Ilaiyaraaja also began writing his own scores . To hear his compositions , he would persuade Venkatesh 's session musicians to play excerpts from his scores during their break times .

 In 1975 , film producer Panchu Arunachalam commissioned him to compose the songs and film score for a Tamil @-@ language film called <unk> ( ' The Parrot ' ) . For the soundtrack , Ilaiyaraaja applied the techniques of modern popular film music orchestration to Tamil folk poetry and folk song melodies , which created a fusion of Western and Tamil idioms . Ilaiyaraaja 's use of Tamil music in his film scores injected new influence into the Indian film score milieu . By the mid @-@ 1980s Ilaiyaraaja was gaining increasing stature as a film composer and music director in the South Indian film industry . He has worked with Indian poets and lyricists such as Kannadasan , Vaali , Vairamuthu , O. N. V. Kurup , <unk> <unk> , Veturi Sundararama Murthy , <unk> <unk> , Sirivennela Sitaramasastri , Chi . Udaya Shankar and Gulzar and is well known for his association with film makers such as Bharathiraja , S. P. Muthuraman , J. Mahendran , Balu Mahendra , K.

 = = = Impact and musical style = = = 
 Ilaiyaraaja was one of the earliest Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string arrangements in Indian film music . This allowed him to craft a rich tapestry of sounds for films , and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences . The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja 's methodical approach to arranging , recording technique , and his drawing of ideas from a diversity of musical styles . 
 According to musicologist P. Greene , Ilaiyaraaja 's " deep understanding of so many different styles of music allowed him to create syncretic pieces of music combining very different musical idioms in unified , coherent musical statements " . Ilaiyaraaja has composed Indian film songs that amalgamated elements of genres such as Afro @-@ tribal , bossa nova , dance music ( e.g. , disco ) , doo @-@ wop , flamenco , acoustic guitar @-@ propelled Western folk , funk , Indian classical , Indian folk / traditional , jazz , march , pathos , pop , psychedelia and rock and roll . 
 By virtue of this variety and his <unk> of Western , Indian folk and Carnatic elements , Ilaiyaraaja 's compositions appeal to the Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities , the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas , and the <unk> for its modern , Western @-@ music sound . Ilaiyaraaja 's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so , he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score . He mastered this art of blending music to the narration , which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time . 
 Although Ilaiyaraaja uses a range of complex compositional techniques , he often sketches out the basic melodic ideas for films in a very spontaneous fashion . 
 = = Musical characteristics = = 
 Ilaiyaraaja 's music is characterised by the use of an orchestration technique that is a synthesis of Western and Indian instruments and musical modes . He uses electronic music technology that integrates synthesizers , electric guitars and keyboards , drum machines , rhythm boxes and MIDI with large orchestras that feature traditional instruments such as the veena , venu , nadaswaram , dholak , <unk> and tabla as well as Western lead instruments such as saxophones and flutes . 
 The basslines in his songs tend to be melodically dynamic , rising and falling in a dramatic fashion . <unk> are also apparent , particularly in songs with Indian folk or Carnatic influences . The melodic structure of his songs demand considerable vocal virtuosity , and have found expressive platform amongst some of India 's respected vocalists and playback singers , such as Rajkumar , T. M. Soundararajan , K. J. Yesudas , S. P. Balasubrahmanyam , S. Janaki , P. Susheela , Asha Bhosle , Lata Mangeshkar , <unk> , S. P. <unk> , <unk> , Swarnalatha , K. S. Chithra , <unk> , Sujatha , Malaysia Vasudevan , Kavita Krishnamurthy , Hariharan , Udit Narayan , Sadhana Sargam and Shreya Ghoshal . Ilaiyaraaja has sung over 400 of his own compositions for films , and is recognisable by his stark , deep voice . He has penned the lyrics for some of his songs in Tamil . 
 = = Non @-@ cinematic output = = 
 Ilaiyaraaja 's first two non @-@ film albums were explorations in the fusion of Indian and Western classical music . The first , How to Name It ? ( 1986 ) , is dedicated to the Carnatic master <unk> and to J. S. Bach . It features a fusion of the Carnatic form and ragas with Bach partitas , fugues and Baroque musical textures . The second , Nothing But Wind ( 1988 ) , was performed by flutist Hariprasad Chaurasia and a 50 @-@ piece orchestra and takes the conceptual approach suggested in the title — that music is a natural phenomenon akin to various forms of air currents ( e.g. , the wind , breeze , tempest etc . ) . 
 He has composed a set of Carnatic <unk> that was recorded by electric <unk> U. Srinivas for the album <unk> 's <unk> on the Mandolin ( 1994 ) . Ilaiyaraaja has also composed albums of religious / devotional songs . His Guru Ramana <unk> ( 2004 ) is a cycle of prayer songs inspired by the Hindu mystic Ramana Maharshi , and his <unk> : A crossover ( 2005 ) is an oratorio of ancient Tamil poems transcribed partially in English by American lyricist Stephen Schwartz and performed by the Budapest Symphony Orchestra . Ilaiyaraaja 's most recent release is a world music @-@ oriented album called The Music Messiah ( 2006 ) .

 = HMS Beagle ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Beagle was a B @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy ( RN ) around 1930 . Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet , she was transferred to the Home Fleet in 1936 . During World War II , the ship spent the bulk of the war on escort duty , participating in the Norwegian Campaign , the Battle of the Atlantic , Operation Torch , the Russian Convoys , and in the Normandy landings before accepting the surrender of the German garrison of the Channel Islands the day after the formal German surrender on 9 May together with another ship . One exception to this pattern was when she helped to evacuate British soldiers and civilians during the Battle of France in 1940 . During the war , Beagle assisted in sinking one German submarine and claimed to have shot down two German aircraft . Redundant after the war , she was broken up for scrap in 1946 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Beagle displaced 1 @,@ 360 long tons ( 1 @,@ 380 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 790 long tons ( 1 @,@ 820 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 32 feet 3 inches ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 3 inches ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . She was powered by Brown @-@ Curtis geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . Beagle carried a maximum of 390 long tons ( 400 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 134 officers and enlisted men , although it increased to 142 during wartime . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Beagle had two 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on a platform between her funnels . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . The ship was fitted with a Type 119 ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water . 
 By October 1940 , the ship 's anti @-@ aircraft armament was increased when the rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 @.@ 2 mm ) ( 12 @-@ pounder ) AA gun and ' Y ' gun was removed to compensate for the additional depth charges added . Around December 1941 , the ship was converted to an escort destroyer with the replacement of her ' A ' gun by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar and additional depth charge stowage replaced the 12 @-@ pounder high @-@ angle gun . The 2 @-@ pounder mounts were replaced by 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon autocannon and two additional Oerlikon guns were also added in the forward superstructure . Sometime before June 1944 , ' A ' gun was reinstalled and the Hedgehog was replaced by a split system , with launchers on each side of the gun . To combat German E @-@ boats , a QF 6 @-@ pounder gun was mounted at the very tip of the bow .

 The ship was ordered on 4 March 1929 from John Brown & Company at Clydebank , Glasgow , under the 1928 Naval Programme . She was laid down on 11 October 1929 , and launched on 26 September 1930 , as the seventh RN ship to carry this name . Beagle was completed on 9 April 1931 at a cost of £ 220 @,@ 342 , excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns , ammunition and communications equipment . After her commissioning , she was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet until 1936 . Shortly before returning home , Beagle was deployed to Jaffa during the Arab Revolt to support British forces there . The flotilla was reassigned to the Home Fleet in September 1936 and the ship began a refit at Devonport after arriving on 27 August that lasted until 16 January 1937 . She was refitted again from 4 April to 17 September 1938 before being assigned as the plane guard for the aircraft carrier Furious . This assignment lasted only two months before she was refitted yet again from 24 November to 3 January 1939 . Beagle then became the plane guard for the carrier Argus during which she collided with her sister ship Basilisk and required a month 's worth of repairs in April – May . Following their completion on 3 May , the ship was reassigned to Furious before she was docked again before the start of World War II on 3 September . 
 Beagle was transferred to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla at the beginning of the war and spent her time until April 1940 escorting convoys and patrolling in the English Channel and the North Sea aside from yet another dockyard period from 18 December 1939 to 22 January 1940 . During the Norwegian Campaign , she escorted convoys between the Orkneys and Narvik , Norway . During the Battle of France , Beagle evacuated British troops and civilians from St. Nazaire and Bordeaux , France . During the former action , she rescued 600 survivors of the ocean liner Lancastria , sunk by German aircraft during the evacuation , on 17 June . 
 The ship was transferred to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla at Dover on 3 July until she was damaged by Junkers Ju 87 " Stuka " dive bombers on 19 July . Beagle 's repairs at Devonport lasted until 16 August and the ship was transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla upon their completion where she served in the English Channel . She was transferred to Home Fleet for escort duties in October and promptly escorted Argus as she ferried aircraft to Iceland and then escorted a convoy to West Africa . Beagle was assigned to Western Approaches Command and its 4th Escort Group in February 1941 for convoy escort duties between the Clyde and Iceland . While under repair for weather damage that broke her foremast in October , a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge that replaced her director @-@ control tower and rangefinder . After the ship was more extensively damaged by weather two months later , Beagle was converted into an escort destroyer , a process that lasted until April 1942 . At some point later in the war , a Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar was fitted . 
 Beagle was assigned as an escort for Convoy QP 14 to the Soviet port of Murmansk in April and escorted Convoy QP 11 on the return trip . The convoy was attacked by three German destroyers on 1 May , but the four escorting destroyers drove off the German ships despite being seriously outgunned . Beagle was lightly damaged by splinters during the engagement . Upon her return , the ship was assigned to the Greenock Escort Force and escorted convoys between the Clyde and Iceland until October when she was transferred to Force H. She participated in Operation Torch in November , before returning to escort Convoys JW 51A , RA 51 , and JW 52 to and from Russia beginning in December . 
 After a refit to improve her radar , anti @-@ submarine equipment , and Arctic habitability , Beagle was ordered to Freetown , Sierra Leone in early 1943 where she served as a local escort until November . That month she returned to the Home Fleet and escorted convoys to and from Russia through May 1944 with the 8th Escort Group . Whilst escorting Convoy <unk> , the ship assisted in sinking the German submarine U @-@ 355 on 1 April in conjunction with aircraft from the escort carrier Tracker . Beagle was then assigned to escort and support the forces participating in Operation Overlord during which the ship claimed to have shot down two Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers in June . She began a refit on 19 July at Sheerness Dockyard that lasted until September and rejoined the 8th Escort Group upon their completion . More extensive repairs were required between December 1944 and February 1945 . Beagle was briefly reassigned to the 8th Escort Group before she was transferred to Plymouth Command on 11 March for escort duties . The ship was tasked to blockade the German @-@ occupied ports in France from 12 April and accepted the surrender of the German garrison of the Channel Islands together with her sister Bulldog on 9 May . Beagle was placed in reserve fifteen days later and was approved for scrapping on 22 December . She was turned over for scrapping on 15 January 1946 at Rosyth and moved to the shipbreaking yard of Metal Industries , Limited two days later .

The senior Brady had emigrated from Ireland to the United States while the War of 1812 was ongoing , and started a boys school in New York . When James was seven , he attended his father 's school . In 1831 James 's father had left teaching to become a lawyer , and he helped his father in his practice and in trials . In his father 's office , James studied legal material tirelessly , and soon operated most of the firm 's managerial affairs .

 Brady was admitted to the New York Bar in either 1835 or 1836 , when he was about twenty years old . His first case was an insurance proceeding , where he opposed the prominent lawyer , Charles O 'Connor . The plaintiff staked a claim for insurance money from a property allegedly burned down by a fire . Though Brady lost that case , his proficiency for law and oration was immediately noted . 
 Brady received his first taste of legal notoriety during the Goodyear v. Day patent case , where he worked under Daniel Webster and delivered the opening arguments for the plaintiff . Nevertheless , Brady is best known for his work as a criminal lawyer . In the quarter century preceding his death , he was involved in nearly every notable criminal proceeding in the Eastern United States . Among his most famous legal undertakings was the defense of Daniel Sickles during his trial for the murder of Philip Barton Key , the then Attorney General of the District of Columbia . During this trial , Brady worked with Edwin Stanton , who would go on to become the United States Secretary of War . Brady also defended Lew Baker at the murder trial of the infamous William " Bill the Butcher " Poole , whom Baker shot to death in 1855 at Stanwix Hall , a bar on Broadway in Manhattan . Over his career , Brady tried 52 criminal cases and lost only one , the case of Confederate privateer John Yates Beall . 
 Though he professed membership in the Democratic Party , Brady was notably disengaged from politics . In 1843 he was made the interim district attorney for New York County . Two years later , Brady was appointed the city 's corporation counsel , a position in which he served two terms , each term lasting for a year . In 1850 Brady ran for , but was not elected to , the position of Attorney General of New York . Brady was on John C. Breckinridge and Joseph Lane 's 1860 Democratic ticket for Governor of New York .

He died at the age of 53 at his home in New York on February 9 at 4 : 45 pm . Brady 's funeral occurred at St. Patrick 's Cathedral , and he was interred at Calvary Cemetery . 
 = History of Roman and Byzantine domes = 
 The History of Roman and Byzantine domes traces the architecture of domes throughout the ancient Roman Empire and its medieval continuation , today called the Byzantine Empire . Domes were important architectural elements in both empires and had widespread influence on contemporary and later styles , from Russian and Ottoman architecture to the Italian Renaissance and modern revivals . The domes were customarily hemispherical , although octagonal and segmented shapes are also known , and they developed in form , use , and structure over the centuries . Early examples rested directly on the rotunda walls of round rooms and featured a central oculus for ventilation and light . Pendentives became common in the Byzantine period , provided support for domes over square spaces . 
 Early wooden domes are known only from a literary source , but the use of wooden formwork , concrete , and unskilled labor enabled domes of monumental size in the late Republic and early Imperial period , such as the so @-@ called " Temple of Mercury " bath hall at Baiae . Nero introduced the dome into Roman palace architecture in the 1st century and such rooms served as state banqueting halls , audience rooms , or throne rooms . The Pantheon 's dome , the largest and most famous example , was built of concrete in the 2nd century and may have served as an audience hall for Hadrian . Imperial mausolea , such as the Mausoleum of Diocletian , were domed beginning in the 3rd century . Some smaller domes were built with a technique of using ceramic tubes in place of a wooden centering for concrete , or as a permanent structure embedded in the concrete , but light brick became the preferred building material over the course of the 4th and 5th centuries . Brick ribs allowed for a thinner structure and facilitated the use of windows in the supporting walls , replacing the need for an oculus as a light source . 
 Christian baptisteries and shrines were domed in the 4th century , such as the Lateran Baptistery and the likely wooden dome over the Church of the Holy Sepulchre . Constantine 's octagonal palace church in Antioch may have been the precedent for similar buildings for centuries afterward . The first domed basilica may have been built in the 5th century , with a church in southern Turkey being the earliest proposed example , but the 6th century architecture of Justinian made domed church architecture standard throughout the Roman east . His Hagia Sophia and Church of the Holy Apostles inspired copies in later centuries . 
 Cruciform churches with domes at their crossings , such as the churches of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki and St. Nicholas at Myra , were typical of 7th and 8th century architecture and bracing a dome with barrel vaults on four sides became the standard structural system . Domes over windowed drums of cylindrical or polygonal shape were standard after the 9th century . In the empire 's later period , smaller churches were built with smaller domes , normally less than 6 meters ( 20 ft ) after the 10th century . Exceptions include the 11th century domed @-@ octagons of Hosios Loukas and Nea Moni , and the 12th century Chora Church , among others . The cross @-@ in @-@ square plan , with a single dome at the crossing or five domes in a quincunx pattern , as at the Church of St. Panteleimon , was the most popular type from the 10th century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Rounded arches , vaults , and domes distinguish Roman architecture from that of Ancient Greece and were facilitated by the use of concrete and brick . By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete , the weight of the concrete could be altered , allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes . But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork , also called shuttering , to be built and kept in place during the curing process , which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed . <unk> for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused . 
 Roman domes were used in baths , villas , palaces , and tombs . Oculi were common features . They were customarily hemispherical in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior . In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome , the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof . A variety of other shapes , including shallow saucer domes , segmental domes , and ribbed domes were also sometimes used . The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed . Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions . Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline and fall of the western portion of the empire . 
 The term " Byzantine " , invented in 1557 by historian Hieronymus Wolf , became popular in the 19th century and is used to refer to the medieval eastern Roman Empire with its capital at Constantinople , the former town of Byzantion . In the Byzantine period , a supporting structure of four arches with pendentives between them allowed the spaces below domes to be opened up . Pendentives allowed for weight loads to be concentrated at just four points on a more practical square plan , rather than a circle . Domes were important elements of baptisteries , churches , and tombs . They were normally hemispherical and had , with occasional exceptions , windowed drums . Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive , more durable , and more form @-@ fitting lead sheeting . 
 The domes and drums typically incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar and allow for faster construction . Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks , metal tie rods , and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed buildings . Timber belts at the bases of domes helped to stabilize the walls below them during earthquakes , but the domes themselves remained vulnerable to collapse . The surviving ribbed or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably , with the number of divisions corresponding to the number of windows . Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century , such ribbed domes could be built with formwork only for the ribs . Pumpkin domes could have been built in self @-@ supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled , dispensing with formwork altogether . 
 = = Late Republic and early Imperial period = = 
 Roman baths played a leading role in the development of domed construction in general , and monumental domes in particular . Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii , in the cold rooms of the Terme <unk> and the Terme del Foro . These domes are very conical in shape , similar to those on an Assyrian bas @-@ relief found in Nineveh . At a Roman era tepidarium in Cabrera de Mar , Spain , a dome has been identified from the middle of the 2nd century BC that used a refined version of the parallel arch construction found in an earlier Hellenistic bath dome in Sicily . According to Vitruvius , the temperature and humidity of domed warm rooms could be regulated by raising or lowering bronze discs located under an oculus . Domes were particularly well suited to the hot rooms of baths circular in plan to facilitate even heating from the walls . However , the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD . 
 Varro 's book on agriculture describes an aviary with a wooden dome decorated with the eight winds that is compared by analogy to the eight winds depicted on the Tower of the Winds , which was built in Athens at about the same time . This aviary with its wooden dome may represent a fully developed type . Wooden domes in general would have allowed for very wide spans . Their earlier use may have inspired the development and introduction of large stone domes of previously unprecedented size . Complex wooden forms were necessary for dome centering and support during construction , and they seem to have eventually become more efficient and standardized over time . 
 The mortar and aggregate of Roman concrete was built up in horizontal layers laid by hand against wooden form @-@ work with the thickness of the layers determined by the length of the workday , rather than being poured into a mold as concrete is today . Roman concrete domes were thus built similarly to the earlier corbel domes of the Mediterranean region , although they have different structural characteristics . The aggregate used by the Romans was often rubble , but lightweight aggregate in the upper levels served to reduce stresses . Empty " vases and jugs " could be hidden inside to reduce weight . The dry concrete mixtures used by the Romans were compacted with rams to eliminate voids , and added animal blood acted as a water reducer . Because Roman concrete was weak in tension , it did not provide any structural advantage over the use of brick or stone . But , because it could be constructed with unskilled slave labor , it provided a constructional advantage and facilitated the building of large @-@ scale domes . 
 Domes reached monumental size in the Roman Imperial period . Although imprints of the formwork itself have not survived , deformations from the ideal of up to 22 centimeters ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) at the so @-@ called " Temple of Mercury " in Baiae suggest a centering of eight radiating frames , with horizontal connectors supporting radial formwork for the shallow dome . The building , actually a concrete bath hall dating from the age of Augustus ( 27 BC – 14 AD ) , has the first known large Roman dome . There are five openings in the dome : a circular oculus and four square skylights . The dome has a span of 21 @.@ 5 meters ( 71 ft ) and is the largest known dome built before that of the Pantheon . It is also the earliest preserved concrete dome .

 While there are earlier examples in the Republican period and early Imperial period , the growth of domed construction increased under Emperor Nero and the Flavians in the 1st century AD , and during the 2nd century . Centrally planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century , serving as state banqueting halls , audience rooms , or throne rooms . <unk> was arranged either horizontally or radially , but there is not enough surviving evidence from the 1st and 2nd centuries to say what was typical . 
 The opulent palace architecture of the Emperor Nero ( 54 – 68 AD ) marks an important development . There is evidence of a dome in his Domus <unk> at the intersection of two corridors , resting on four large piers , which may have had an oculus at the center . In Nero 's Domus Aurea , or " Golden House " , planned by Severus and <unk> , the walls of a large octagonal room transition to an octagonal domical vault , which then transitions to a dome with an oculus . This is the earliest known example of a dome in the city of Rome itself . 
 The Domus Aurea was built after 64 AD and the dome was over 13 meters ( 43 ft ) in diameter . This octagonal and semicircular dome is made of concrete and the oculus is made of brick . The radial walls of the surrounding rooms buttress the dome , allowing the octagonal walls directly beneath it to contain large openings under flat arches and for the room itself to be unusually well lit . Because there is no indication that mosaic or other facing material had ever been applied to the surface of the dome , it may have been hidden behind a tent @-@ like fabric canopy like the pavilion tents of Hellenistic ( and earlier Persian ) rulers . The oculus is unusually large , more than two @-@ fifths the span of the room , and it may have served to support a lightweight lantern structure or tholos , which would have covered the opening . Circular channels on the upper surface of the oculus also support the idea that this lantern , perhaps itself domed , was the rotating dome referred to in written accounts . 
 According to Suetonius , the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on its base in imitation of the sky . It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall . Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling , although it is not known whether this was a feature of the same dome . The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero 's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site . 
 The only intact dome from the reign of Emperor Domitian is a 16 @.@ 1 @-@ meter ( 53 ft ) wide example in what may have been a nymphaeum at his villa at Albano . It is now the church of Santa Maria della Rotunda . Domitian 's 92 AD Domus Augustana established the apsidal semi @-@ dome as an imperial motif . Square chambers in his palace on the Palatine Hill used pendentives to support domes . His palace contained three domes resting over walls with alternating apses and rectangular openings . An octagonal domed hall existed in the domestic wing . Unlike Nero 's similar octagonal dome , its segments extended all the way to the oculus . The dining hall of this private palace , called the <unk> Jovis , or Dining Hall of Jupiter , contained a rotating ceiling like the one Nero had built , but with stars set into the simulated sky . 
 = = Second century = = 
 During the reign of Emperor Trajan , domes and semi @-@ domes over exedras were standard elements of Roman architecture , possibly due to the efforts of Trajan 's architect , Apollodorus of Damascus , who was famed for his engineering ability . Two rotundas 20 meters ( 66 ft ) in diameter were finished in 109 AD as part of the Baths of Trajan , built over the Domus Aurea , and exedras 13 and 18 meters ( 43 and 59 ft ) wide were built as part of the markets north @-@ east of his forum . The architecture of Trajan 's successor , Hadrian , continued this style . Although considered an example of Hadrianic architecture , there is <unk> evidence that the rebuilding of the Pantheon in its present form was begun under Trajan . Speculation that the architect of the Pantheon was Apollodorus has not been proven , although there are stylistic commonalities between his large coffered half @-@ domes at Trajan 's Baths and the dome of the Pantheon . Three 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) wide exedras at Trajan 's Baths have patterns of coffering that , as in the Pantheon , align with lower niches only on the axes and diagonals and , also as in the Pantheon , that alignment is sometimes with the ribs between the coffers , rather than with the coffers themselves . 
 The Pantheon , a temple in Rome completed by Emperor Hadrian as part of the Baths of Agrippa , is the most famous , best preserved , and largest Roman dome . Its diameter was more than twice as wide as any known earlier dome . Dating from the 2nd century , it is an unreinforced concrete dome 43 @.@ 4 meters ( 142 ft ) wide resting on a circular wall , or rotunda , 6 meters ( 20 ft ) thick . This rotunda , made of brick @-@ faced concrete , contains a large number of relieving arches and is not solid . Seven interior niches and the entrance way divide the wall structurally into eight virtually independent piers . These openings and additional voids account for a quarter of the rotunda wall 's volume . The only opening in the dome is the brick @-@ lined oculus at the top , 9 meters ( 30 ft ) in diameter , that provides light and ventilation for the interior . 
 The shallow coffering in the dome accounts for a less than five percent reduction in the dome 's mass , and is mostly decorative . The aggregate material hand @-@ placed in the concrete is heaviest at the base of the dome and changes to lighter materials as the height increases , dramatically reducing the stresses in the finished structure . In fact , many commentators cite the Pantheon as an example of the revolutionary possibilities for monolithic architecture provided by the use of Roman pozzolana concrete . However , vertical cracks seem to have developed very early , such that in practice the dome acts as an array of arches with a common keystone , rather than as a single unit . The exterior step @-@ rings used to compress the " haunches " of the dome , which would not be necessary if the dome acted as a monolithic structure , may be an acknowledgement of this by the builders themselves . Such buttressing was common in Roman arch construction . The cracks in the dome can be seen from the upper internal chambers of the rotunda , but have been covered by re @-@ rendering on the inner surface and by patching on the outside . The Pantheon 's roof was originally covered with gilt bronze tiles , but these were removed in 663 by Emperor Constans II and replaced by lead roofing . 
 The function of the Pantheon remains an open question . Strangely for a temple , its inscription , which attributes this third building at the site to the builder of the first , Marcus Agrippa , does not mention any god or group of gods . Its name , Pantheon , comes from the Greek for " all gods " but is unofficial , and it was not included in the list of temples restored by Hadrian in the Historia Augusta . Circular temples were small and rare , and Roman temples traditionally allowed for only one divinity per room . The Pantheon more resembles structures found in imperial palaces and baths . Hadrian is believed to have held court in the rotunda using the main apse opposite the entrance as a tribune , which may explain its very large size . Later Roman buildings similar to the Pantheon include a temple to <unk> Soter ( c . 145 ) in the old Hellenistic city of Pergamon and the so @-@ called " Round Temple " at Ostia ( c . 230 – 240 ) , which may have been related to the Imperial cult . The Pergamon dome was about 80 Roman feet wide , versus about 150 for the Pantheon , and made of brick over a cut stone rotunda . The Ostia dome was 60 Roman feet wide and made of brick @-@ faced concrete . No later dome built in the Imperial era came close to the span of the Pantheon . It remained the largest dome in the world for more than a millennium and is still the world 's largest unreinforced concrete dome . 
 Segmented domes made of radially concave wedges , or of alternating concave and flat wedges , appear under Hadrian in the 2nd century and most preserved examples of the style date from this period . Hadrian 's Villa has examples at the Piazza D 'Oro and in the <unk> of the Serapeum . Recorded details of the decoration of the segmented dome at the Piazza D 'Oro suggests it was made to evoke a billowing tent , perhaps in imitation of the canopies used by Hellenistic kings . Other examples exist at the Hadrianic baths of <unk> and the so @-@ called " Temple of Venus " at Baiae . This style of dome required complex centering and radially oriented formwork to create its tight curves , and the earliest surviving direct evidence of radial formwork is found at the caldarium of the Large Baths at Hadrian 's villa . Hadrian was an amateur architect and it was apparently domes of Hadrian 's like these that Trajan 's architect , Apollodorus of Damascus , derisively called " pumpkins " prior to Hadrian becoming emperor . According to Dio Cassius , the memory of this insult contributed to Hadrian as emperor having Apollodorus exiled and killed . 
 In the middle of the 2nd century , some of the largest domes were built near present @-@ day Naples , as part of large bath complexes taking advantage of the volcanic hot springs in the area . At the bath complex at Baiae , there are remains of a collapsed dome spanning 26 @.@ 3 meters ( 86 ft ) , called the " Temple of Venus " , and a larger half @-@ collapsed dome spanning 29 @.@ 5 meters ( 97 ft ) called the " Temple of Diana " . The dome of the " Temple of Diana " , which may have been a nymphaeum as part of the bath complex , can be seen to have had an ogival section made of horizontal layers of mortared brick and capped with light tufa . It dates to the second half of the 2nd century and is the third largest dome known from the Roman world . The second largest is the collapsed " Temple of Apollo " built nearby along the shore of Lake <unk> . The span cannot be precisely measured due to its ruined state , but it was more than 36 meters ( 118 ft ) in diameter . 
 In the second half of the 2nd century in North Africa , a distinctive type of nozzle tube shape was developed in the tradition of the terracotta tube dome at the Hellenistic era baths of <unk> , an idea that had been preserved in the use of interlocking terracotta pots for kiln roofs . This tube could be mass @-@ produced on potter 's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent centering for concrete domes , avoiding the use of wooden centering altogether . This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean . 
 Although rarely used , the pendentive dome was known in 2nd century Roman architecture , such as the funerary monuments of the <unk> dei Diavolo and the <unk> della <unk> on the Via <unk> . It would be used much more widely in the Byzantine period . 
 = = Third century = = 
 In the 3rd century , imperial mausolea began to be built as domed rotundas rather than tumulus structures or other types , following similar monuments by private citizens . Pagan and Christian domed mausolea from this time can be differentiated in that the structures of the buildings also reflect their religious functions . The pagan buildings are typically two story , dimly lit , free @-@ standing structures with a lower crypt area for the remains and an upper area for devotional sacrifice . Christian domed mausolea contain a single well @-@ lit space and are usually attached to a church . 
 Examples from the 3rd century include the brick dome of the Mausoleum of Diocletian , and the mausoleum at Villa <unk> . The Mausoleum of Diocletian uses small arched squinches of brick built up from a circular base in an overlapping scales pattern , called a " stepped squinches dome " . The scales pattern was a popular Hellenistic motif adopted by the Parthians and Sasanians , and such domes are likely related to Persian " squinch vaults " . Masonry domes were less common in the Roman provinces , although the 3rd century " Temple of Venus " at Baalbek was built with a stone dome 10 meters ( 33 ft ) in diameter . The 24 @-@ meter ( 79 ft ) dome of the Mausoleum of Galerius was built around 300 AD close to the imperial palace as either a mausoleum or a throne room . It was converted into a church in the 5th century . The large rotunda of the Baths of Agrippa , the oldest public baths in Rome , has been dated to the Severan period at the beginning of the 3rd century , but it is not known whether this is an addition or simply a reconstruction of an earlier domed rotunda . 
 The technique of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries . By the 4th century , the thin and lightweight tubed vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right , rather than simply serving as a permanent centering for concrete . It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy . Arranging these terracotta tubes in a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans , but required only minimal centering and formwork . The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example . 
 = = Fourth century = = 
 In the 4th century , Roman domes proliferated due to changes in the way domes were constructed , including advances in centering techniques and the use of brick ribbing . The so @-@ called " Temple of Minerva Medica " , for example , used brick ribs along with step @-@ rings and lightweight pumice aggregate concrete to form a decagonal dome . The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells . The use of ribs stiffened the structure , allowing domes to be thinner with less massive supporting walls . Windows were often used in these walls and replaced the oculus as a source of light , although buttressing was sometimes necessary to compensate for large openings . The Mausoleum of Santa Costanza has windows beneath the dome and nothing but paired columns beneath that , using a surrounding barrel vault to buttress the structure . 
 The octagonal " Domus Aurea " , or " Golden Octagon " , built by Emperor Constantine in 327 at the imperial palace of Antioch likewise had a domical roof , presumably of wood and covered with gilded lead . It was dedicated two years after the Council of Nicea to " Harmony , the divine power that unites Universe , Church , and Empire " . It may have been both the cathedral of Antioch as well as the court church of Constantine , and the precedent for the later octagonal plan churches near palaces of Saints Sergius and Bacchus and Hagia Sophia by Justinian and Aachen Cathedral by Charlemagne . The dome was rebuilt by 537 – 8 with cypress wood from Daphne after being destroyed in a fire . Most domes on churches in the Syrian region were built of wood , like that of the later Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem , and the dome of the Domus Aurea survived a series of earthquakes in the 6th century that destroyed the rest of the building . There is no record of the church being rebuilt after the earthquake of 588 , perhaps due to the general abandonment of many public buildings in what was no longer a capital of the Empire . 
 Centralized buildings of circular or octagonal plan also became used for baptistries and reliquaries due to the suitability of those shapes for assembly around a single object . <unk> began to be built in the manner of domed mausolea during the 4th century in Italy . The octagonal Lateran Baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first , and the style spread during the 5th century . The Church of the Holy Apostles , or <unk> , probably planned by Constantine but built by his successor Constantius in the new capital city of Constantinople , combined the congregational basilica with the centralized shrine . With a similar plan to that of the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites , four naves projected from a central rotunda containing Constantine 's tomb and spaces for the tombs of the twelve Apostles . Above the center may have been a clerestory with a wooden dome roofed with bronze sheeting and gold accents . 
 Christian mausolea and shrines developed into the " centralized church " type , often with a dome over a raised central space . The oblong decagon of today 's St. Gereon 's Basilica in Cologne , Germany , was built upon an extraordinary and richly decorated 4th century Roman building with an apse , semi @-@ domed niches , and dome . A church built in the city 's northern cemetery , its original dedication is unknown . It may have been built by Julianus , the governor of Gaul from 355 to 360 who would later become emperor , as a mausoleum for his family . The oval space may have been patterned after imperial audience halls or buildings such as the Temple of Minerva Medica . The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was likely built with a wooden dome over the shrine by the end of the 4th century . The rotunda , 33 @.@ 7 meters ( 111 ft ) in diameter and centered on the tomb of Christ , consisted of a domed center room surrounded by an ambulatory . The dome rose over a ground floor , gallery , and clerestory and may have had an oculus . The dome was about 21 meters ( 69 ft ) wide . <unk> to the ground in 1009 by the Fatimid Caliph , it was rebuilt in 1048 by Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos , reportedly with a mosaic depicting Christ and the Twelve Apostles . The current dome is a 1977 renovation in thin reinforced concrete . 
 The largest centrally planned Early Christian church , Milan 's domed San Lorenzo Maggiore , was built in the middle of the 4th century while that city served as the capital of the Western Empire . There are two theories about the shape of this dome : a Byzantine @-@ style dome on spherical pendentives with a ring of windows similar to domes of the later Justinian era , or an octagonal cloister vault following Roman trends and like the vaulting over the site 's contemporary chapel of Saint <unk> , possibly built with vaulting tubes , pieces of which had been found in excavations . Although these tubes have been shown to date from a medieval reconstruction , there is evidence supporting the use of Roman concrete in the original dome . The original vaulting was concealed by a square drum externally rather than the octagon of today , which dates from the 16th century . 
 = = Fifth century = = 
 By the 5th century , structures with small @-@ scale domed cross plans existed across the Christian world . Examples include the Mausoleum of Galla <unk> , the <unk> attached to the Basilica of San <unk> , and churches in Macedonia and on the coast of Asia Minor . Small brick domes are also found in towers of Constantinople 's early 5th century land walls . Underground cisterns in Constantinople , such as the Cistern of <unk> and the Basilica Cistern , were composed of a grid of columns supporting small domes , rather than groin vaults . The square bay with an overhead sail vault or dome on pendentives became the basic unit of architecture in the early Byzantine centuries , found in a variety of combinations . 
 Early examples of Byzantine domes existed over the hexagonal hall of the Palace of <unk> , the hexagon at Gülhane , the <unk> of Sts . <unk> and <unk> , and the rotunda at the Myrelaion . The 5th century St. Mary 's church in Ephesus had small rectangular side rooms with sail vaults made of arched brick courses . The brick dome of the baptistery at St. Mary 's was composed of a series of tightly arched meridional sections . The Church of Saint Simeon Stylites likely had a wooden polygonal dome over its central 27 @-@ meter ( 89 ft ) wide octagon . 
 With the end of the Western Roman Empire , domes became a signature feature of the church architecture of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire . A transition from timber @-@ roofed basilicas to vaulted churches seems to have occurred between the late 5th century and the 7th century , with early examples in Constantinople , Asia Minor , and Cilicia . The first known domed basilica may have been a church at Meriamlik in southern Turkey , dated to between 471 and 494 , although the ruins do not provide a definitive answer . It is possible earlier examples existed in Constantinople , where it has been suggested that the plan for the Meriamlik church itself was designed , but no domed basilica has been found there before the 6th century . 
 = = Sixth century = = 
 The 6th century marks a turning point for domed church architecture . Centrally planned domed churches had been built since the 4th century for very particular functions , such as palace churches or <unk> , with a slight widening of use around 500 AD , but most church buildings were timber @-@ roofed halls on the basilica plan . The Church of St. Polyeuctus in Constantinople ( 524 – 527 ) was apparently built as a large and lavish domed basilica similar to the Meriamlik church of fifty years before — and to the later Hagia Irene of Emperor Justinian — by Anicia Juliana , a descendent of the former imperial house . There is a story that she used the contribution to public funds that she had promised Justinian on his ascension to the throne to roof her church in gold . The church included an inscription praising Juliana for having " surpassed Solomon " with the building , and it may have been with this in mind that Justinian would later say of his Hagia Sophia , " Solomon , I have vanquished thee ! " . 
 In the second third of the 6th century , church building by the Emperor Justinian used the domed cross unit on a monumental scale , in keeping with Justinian 's emphasis on bold architectural innovation . His church architecture emphasized the central dome and his architects made the domed brick @-@ vaulted central plan standard throughout the Roman east . This divergence with the Roman west from the second third of the 6th century may be considered the beginning of a " Byzantine " architecture . Timber @-@ roofed basilicas , which had previously been the standard church form , would continue to be so in the medieval west . 
 The earliest existing of Justinian 's domed buildings is the central plan Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople , completed by 536 . It is called the " Little Hagia Sophia " mosque today , but was actually begun five years earlier than that building . The dome rests on an octagonal base created by eight arches on piers and is divided into sixteen sections . Those sections above the flat sides of the octagon are flat and contain a window at their base , alternating with sections from the corners of the octagon that are scalloped , creating an unusual kind of pumpkin dome . The building was built within the precinct of the Palace of <unk> , the residence of Justinian before his ascension to the throne in 527 , and includes an inscription mentioning the " <unk> Justinian " and " God @-@ crowned Theodora " . 
 After the Nika Revolt destroyed much of the city of Constantinople in 532 , including the churches of Hagia Sophia ( " Holy Wisdom " ) and Hagia Irene ( " Holy Peace " ) , Justinian had the opportunity to rebuild . Both had been basilica plan churches and both were rebuilt as domed basilicas , although the Hagia Sophia was rebuilt on a much grander scale . Built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus in Constantinople between 532 and 537 , the Hagia Sophia has been called the greatest building in the world . It is an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi @-@ domes . Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs . The precise shape of the original central dome completed in 537 was significantly different from the current one and , according to contemporary accounts , much bolder . 
 Procopius wrote that the original dome seemed " not to rest upon solid masonry , but to cover the space with its golden dome suspended from heaven . " Byzantine chronicler John Malalas reported that this dome was 20 byzantine feet lower than its replacement . One theory is that the original dome continued the curve of the existing pendentives ( which were partially reconstructed after its collapse ) , creating a massive sail vault pierced with a ring of windows . This vault would have been part of a theoretical sphere 46 meters ( 151 ft ) in diameter ( the distance from the base of one pendentive to the base of the one opposite ) , 7 percent greater than the span of the Pantheon 's dome . Another theory raises the shallow cap of this dome ( the portion above what are today the pendentives ) on a relatively short recessed drum containing the windows . This first dome partially collapsed due to an earthquake in 558 and the design was then revised to the present profile . Earthquakes also caused partial collapses of the dome in 989 and 1346 , so that the present dome consists of portions dating from the 6th century , on the north and south sides , and portions from the 10th and 14th centuries on the west and east sides , respectively . There are irregularities where these sectors meet . 
 The current central dome , above the pendentives , is about 750 millimeters ( 30 in ) thick . It is about 32 meters ( 105 ft ) wide and contains 40 radial ribs that spring from between the 40 windows at its base . Four of the windows were blocked as part of repairs in the 10th century . The ring of windows at the base of the central dome are in the portion where the greatest hoop tension would have been expected and so they may have been used to help alleviate cracking along the meridians . Iron cramps between the marble blocks of its cornice helped to reduce outward thrusts at the base and limit cracking , like the wooden tension rings used in other Byzantine brick domes . The dome and pendentives are supported by four large arches springing from four piers . Additionally , two huge semi @-@ domes of similar proportion are placed on opposite sides of the central dome and themselves contain smaller semi @-@ domes between an additional four piers . The Hagia Sophia , as both the cathedral of Constantinople and the church of the adjacent Great Palace of Constantinople , has a form of octagonal plan . 
 The city of Ravenna , Italy , had served as the capital of the Western Roman Empire after Milan from 402 and the capital of the subsequent kingdoms of Odoacer and of Theodoric until Justinian 's reconquest in 540 . The octagonal Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna , begun under Theodoric in 525 , was completed under the Byzantines in 547 and contains a terracotta dome . It may belong to a school of architecture from 4th and 5th century Milan . The building is similar to the Byzantine Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the later Chrysotriklinos , or throne hall and palace church of Constantinople , and it would be used as the model for Charlemagne 's palace chapel at Aix @-@ la @-@ Chapelle . Hollow amphorae were fitted inside one another to provide a lightweight structure for the dome and avoid additional buttressing . It is 18 meters ( 59 ft ) in diameter . The amphorae were arranged in a continuous spiral , which required minimal centering and formwork but was not strong enough for large spans . The dome was covered with a timber roof , which would be the favored practice for later medieval architects in Italy although it was unusual at the time . 
 In Constantinople , Justinian also tore down the aging Church of the Holy Apostles and rebuilt it on a grander scale between 536 and 550 . The original building was a cruciform basilica with a central domed mausoleum . Justinian 's replacement was apparently likewise cruciform but with a central dome and four flanking domes . The central dome over the crossing had pendentives and windows in its base , while the four domes over the arms of the cross had pendentives but no windows . The domes appear to have been radically altered between 944 and 985 by the addition of windowed drums beneath all five domes and by raising the central dome higher than the others . The second most important church in the city after the Hagia Sophia , it fell into disrepair after the Latin occupation of Constantinople between 1204 and 1261 and it was razed to the ground by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1461 to build his Fatih Mosque on the site . Justinian 's Basilica of St. John at Ephesus and Venice 's St Mark 's Basilica are derivative of Holy Apostles . More loosely , the Cathedral of St. Front and the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua are also derived from this church . 
 Justinian and his successors modernized frontier fortifications throughout the century . The example at Qasr ibn Wardan ( 564 ) in the desert of eastern Syria is particularly impressive , containing a governor 's palace , barracks , and a church built with techniques and to plans possibly imported from Constantinople . The church dome is unusual in that the pendentives sprang from an octagonal drum , rather than the four main arches , and in that it was made of brick , which was rare in Syria . 
 The Golden <unk> , or Chrysotriklinos , of the Great Palace of Constantinople served as an audience hall for the Emperor as well as a palace chapel . Nothing of it has survived except descriptions , which indicate that it had a pumpkin dome containing sixteen windows in its webs and that the dome was supported by the arches of eight niches connecting to adjoining rooms in the building 's likely circular plan . Alternatively , the building may have been octagonal in plan , rather than circular . The dome seems to have had webs that alternated straight and concave , like those of the dome of Justinian 's Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus , and may have been built about 40 years after that church . It was begun under Emperor Justin II , completed by his successor Tiberius II , and continued to be improved by subsequent rulers . It was connected to the imperial living quarters and was a space used for assembly before religious festivals , high promotions and consultations , as a banqueting hall , a chapel for the emperor , and a throne room . Never fully described in any of its frequent mentions in Byzantine texts , the room was restricted to members of the court and the " most highly rated foreigners " . In the 10th century , the throne in the east niche chamber was directly below an icon of an enthroned Christ . 
 = = Seventh and eighth centuries = = 
 The period of Iconoclasm , roughly corresponding to the 7th to 9th centuries , is poorly documented but can be considered a transitional period . The cathedral of Sofia has an unsettled date of construction , ranging from the last years of Justinian to the middle of the 7th century , as the Balkans were lost to the Slavs and Bulgars . It combines a barrel @-@ vaulted cruciform basilica plan with a crossing dome hidden externally by the drum . It resembles some Romanesque churches of later centuries , although the type would not be popular in later Byzantine architecture . Part of the 5th century basilica of St. Mary at Ephesus seems to have been rebuilt in the 8th century as a cross @-@ domed church , a development typical of the 7th to 8th centuries and similar to the cross @-@ domed examples of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki , St. Nicholas at Myra , St. Clement 's at Ankara , and the church of the <unk> at Nicaea . 
 With the decline in the empire 's resources following losses in population and territory , domes in Byzantine architecture were used as part of more modest new buildings . The large @-@ scale churches of Byzantium were , however , kept in good repair . The upper portion of the Church of Hagia Irene was thoroughly rebuilt after an earthquake in 740 . The nave was re @-@ covered with an elliptical domical vault hidden externally by a low cylinder on the roof , in place of the earlier barrel vaulted ceiling , and the original central dome from the Justinian era was replaced with one raised upon a high windowed drum . The barrel vaults supporting these two new domes were also extended out over the side aisles , creating cross @-@ domed units . By bracing the dome with broad arches on all four sides , the cross @-@ domed unit provided a more secure structural system . These units , with most domes raised on drums , became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture , and all domes built after the transitional period were braced with bilateral symmetry . 
 A small , unisex monastic community in Bithynia , near Constantinople , may have developed the cross @-@ in @-@ square plan church during the Iconoclastic period , which would explain the plan 's small scale and unified naos . The ruined church of St. John at <unk> monastery is an early example . Monks had supported the use of icons , unlike the government @-@ appointed secular clergy , and monasticism would become increasingly popular . A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on , which may help to explain the small size of subsequent building .

 Timber @-@ roofed basilicas , which had been the standard form until the 6th century , would be displaced by domed churches from the 9th century on . In the Middle Byzantine period ( c . 843 – 1204 ) , domes were normally built to emphasize separate functional spaces , rather than as the modular ceiling units they had been earlier . Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style , with regional characteristics . 
 The cross @-@ in @-@ square plan , with a single dome at the crossing or five domes in a quincunx pattern , became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period . Examples include an early 9th century church in <unk> , now called the Fatih Mosque , and the palace chapel of the Myrelaion , built around 920 . The Nea Ekklesia of Emperor Basil I was built in Constantinople around 880 as part of a substantial building renovation and construction program during his reign . It had five domes , which are known from literary sources , but different arrangements for them have been proposed under at least four different plans . One has the domes arranged in a cruciform pattern like those of the contemporaneous Church of St. Andrew at <unk> or the much older Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople . Others arrange them in a quincunx pattern , with four minor domes in the corners of a square and a larger fifth in the center , as part of a cross @-@ domed or cross @-@ in @-@ square plan . It is often suggested that the five @-@ domed design of St. Panteleimon at Nerezi , from 1164 , is based on that of the Nea Ekklesia . 
 The cross @-@ in @-@ square is the most common church plan from the 10th century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 . This type of plan , with four columns supporting the dome at the crossing , was best suited for domes less than 7 meters ( 23 ft ) wide and , from the 10th to the 14th centuries , a typical Byzantine dome measured less than 6 meters ( 20 ft ) in diameter . For domes beyond that width , variations in the plan were required such as using piers in place of the columns and incorporating further buttressing around the core of the building . The distinctive rippling eaves design for the roofs of domes begins in the 10th century . In mainland Greece , circular or octagonal drums became the most common while , in Constantinople , drums with twelve or fourteen sides were popular beginning in the 11th century . The 11th century rock @-@ cut churches of Cappadocia , such as <unk> Kilise and <unk> Kilise in <unk> , have shallow domes without drums due to the dim natural lighting of cave interiors . 
 The domed @-@ octagon plan is a variant of the cross @-@ in @-@ square plan . The earliest extant example is the katholikon at the monastery of Hosios Loukas , with a 9 @-@ meter ( 30 ft ) wide dome built in the first half of the 11th century . This hemispherical dome was built without a drum and supported by a remarkably open structural system , with the weight of the dome distributed on eight piers , rather than four , and corbelling used to avoid concentrating weight on their corners . The use of squinches to transition from those eight supports to the base of the dome has led to speculation of a design origin in Arab , Sasanian , or Caucasian architecture , although with a Byzantine interpretation . Similar openness in design was used in the earlier Myrelaion church , as originally built , but the katholikon of Hosios Loukas is perhaps the most sophisticated design since the Hagia Sophia . The smaller monastic church at <unk> , c . 1080 , uses a simpler version of this plan . 
 The katholikon of Nea Moni , a monastery on the island of Chios , was built some time between 1042 and 1055 and featured a nine sided , ribbed dome rising 15 @.@ 62 meters ( 51 @.@ 2 ft ) above the floor ( this collapsed in 1881 and was replaced with the slightly taller present version ) . The transition from the square naos to the round base of the drum is accomplished by eight conches , with those above the flat sides of the naos being relatively shallow and those in the corners of the being relatively narrow . The novelty of this technique in Byzantine architecture has led to it being dubbed the " island octagon " type , in contrast to the " mainland octagon " type of Hosios Loukas . Speculation on design influences have ranged from Arab influence transmitted via the recently built domed octagon chapels at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem or the Al @-@ Hakim Mosque in Islamic Cairo , to Caucasian buildings such as the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross . Later copies of the Nea Moni , with alterations , include the churches of Agios Georgios <unk> , <unk> Apostoli at <unk> , Panagia <unk> , and the Church of the Metamorphosis in <unk> . 
 The larger scale of some Byzantine buildings of the 12th century required a more stable support structure for domes than the four slender columns of the cross @-@ in @-@ square type could provide . The domes of the churches now called <unk> Mosque , Gül Mosque , and the <unk> Fatih mosque all had domes greater than 7 meters ( 23 ft ) in diameter and used piers as part of large cruciform plans , a practice that had been out of fashion for several centuries . A variant of the cross @-@ in @-@ square , the " so @-@ called atrophied Greek cross plan " , also provides greater support for a dome than the typical cross @-@ in @-@ square plan by using four piers projecting from the corners of an otherwise square naos , rather than four columns . This design was used in the Chora Church of Constantinople in the 12th century after the previous cross @-@ in @-@ square structure was destroyed by an earthquake . 
 The 12th century Pantokrator monastic complex ( 1118 – 36 ) was built with imperial sponsorship as three adjoining churches . The south church , a cross @-@ in @-@ square , has a ribbed dome over the naos , domical vaults in the corners , and a pumpkin dome over the narthex gallery . The north church is also a cross @-@ in @-@ square plan . The middle church , the third to be built , fills the long space between the two earlier churches with two oval domes of the pumpkin and ribbed types over what appear to be separate functional spaces . The western space was an imperial mausoleum , whereas the eastern dome covered a liturgical space . 
 There is a written account by Nicholas Mesarites of a Persian @-@ style muqarnas dome built as part of a late 12th century imperial palace in Constantinople . Called the " <unk> Hall " , it may have been built as part of an easing in tensions between the court of Manuel I Komnenos and Kilij Arslan II of the Sultanate of Rum around 1161 , evidence of the complex nature of the relations between the two states . The account , written by Nicholas Mesarites shortly before the Fourth Crusade , is part of a description of the coup attempt by John Komnenos in 1200 , and may have been mentioned as a rhetorical device to disparage him . 
 = = Thirteenth to fifteenth centuries = = 
 The Late Byzantine Period , from 1204 to 1453 , has an unsettled chronology of buildings , especially during the Latin Occupation . The fragmentation of the empire , beginning in 1204 , is reflected in a fragmentation of church design and regional innovations . After 1261 , new church architecture in Constantinople consisted mainly of additions to existing monastic churches , such as the Monastery of Lips and <unk> Church , and as a result the building complexes are distinguished in part by an asymmetric array of domes on their roofs . This effect may have been in imitation of the earlier triple church Pantokrator monastic complex . A 15th century account of a Russian traveler to Constantinople mentions an abandoned hall , presumably domed , " in which the sun , the moon , and the stars succeeded each other as in heaven . " 
 The church of Hagia Sophia in the Empire of Trebizond dates to between 1238 and 1263 and has a variation on the quincunx plan . Heavy with traditional detailing from Asia Minor , and possibly Armenian or Georgian influence , the brick pendentives and drum of the dome remain Byzantine . 
 In the Despotate of Epirus , the Church of the <unk> ( 1282 – 9 ) is the most complex example , with a domed octagon core and domed ambulatory . Built in the capital of Arta , its external appearance resembles a cubic palace . The upper level narthex and galleries have five domes , with the middle dome of the narthex an open lantern . This Greek @-@ cross octagon design , similar to the earlier example at <unk> , is one of several among the various Byzantine principalities . Another is found in the Hagia <unk> at Mistra ( 1290 – 6 ) . 
 Mistra was ruled from Constantinople after 1262 , then was the suzerain of the Despotate of the Morea from 1348 to 1460 . In Mistra , there are several basilica plan churches with domed galleries that create a five @-@ domed cross @-@ in @-@ square over a ground @-@ level basilica plan . The <unk> at <unk> Monastery was built c . 1310 – 22 and the later church of the <unk> Monastery ( 1428 ) is of the same type . The <unk> may have been originally planned as a cross @-@ in @-@ square church , but has a blend of longitudinal and central plan components , with an interior divided into nave and aisles like a basilica . The barrel @-@ vaulted nave and cross arms have a dome at their crossing , and the corner bays of the galleries are also domed to form a quincunx pattern . A remodeling of the Metropolis church in Mistra created an additional example . The <unk> incorporates Western elements in that domes in its colonnaded porch are hidden externally , and its domes have ribs of rectangular section similar to those of Salerno , Ravello , and Palermo . 
 In Thessaloniki , a distinctive type of church dome developed in the first two decades of the 14th century . It is characterized by a polygonal drum with rounded colonnettes at the corners , all brick construction , and faces featuring three arches stepped back within one another around a narrow " single @-@ light window " . One of the hallmarks of <unk> churches was the plan of a domed naos with a <unk> wrapped around three sides . The churches of <unk> Panteleimon , Hagia <unk> , and <unk> <unk> have domes on these ambulatory porticoes . The five domes of the <unk> <unk> , or Church of the Holy Apostles , in Thessaloniki ( c . 1329 ) makes it an example of a five @-@ domed cross @-@ in @-@ square church in the Late Byzantine style , as is the Gračanica monastery , built around 1311 in Serbia . The architect and artisans of the Gračanica monastery church probably came from Thessaloniki and its style reflects Byzantine cultural influence . The church has been said to represent " the culmination of Late Byzantine architectural design . " 
 = = Influence = = 
 Constantinople 's cultural influence extended from Sicily to Russia . Armenia , as a border state between the Roman @-@ Byzantine and Sasanian empires , was influenced by both . The exact relationship between Byzantine architecture and that of the Caucasus is unclear . Georgia and Armenia produced many central planned , domed buildings in the 7th century and , after a lull during the Arab invasions , the architecture flourished again in the Middle Byzantine Period . Armenian church domes were initially wooden structures . Etchmiadzin Cathedral ( c . 483 ) originally had a wooden dome covered by a wooden pyramidal roof before this was replaced with stone construction in 618 . Churches with stone domes became the standard type after the 7th century , perhaps benefiting from a possible exodus of stonecutters from Syria , but the long traditions of wooden construction carried over stylistically . Some examples in stone as late as the 12th century are detailed imitations of clearly wooden prototypes . Armenian church building was prolific in the late 6th and 7th centuries and , by the 7th century , the churches tend to be either central plans or combinations of central and longitudinal plans . Domes were supported by either squinches ( which were used in the Sasanian Empire but rarely in the Byzantine ) or pendentives like those of the Byzantine empire , and the combination of domed @-@ cross plan with the hall @-@ church plan could have been influenced by the architecture of Justinian . Domes and cross arms were added to the longitudinal cathedral of Dvin from 608 to 615 and a church in <unk> . Other domed examples include <unk> in <unk> ( c . 600 ) , a church in T <unk> ( 662 @-@ 85 ) , and the Cathedral of <unk> ( 629 @-@ 40 ) . 
 In the Balkans , where Byzantine rule weakened in the 7th and 8th centuries , domed architecture may represent Byzantine influence or , in the case of the centrally planned churches of 9th @-@ century Dalmatia , the revival of earlier Roman mausoleum types . An interest in Roman models may have been an expression of the religious maneuvering of the region between the Church of Constantinople and that of Rome . Examples include the Church of Sv . Luka in Kotor , the Church of Sv . <unk> near Split , and the early 9th century Church of Sv . Donat in Zadar . The Church of Sv . Donat , originally domed , may have been built next to a palace and resembles palace churches in the Byzantine tradition . The architectural chronology of the central and eastern Balkans is unsettled during the period of the First Bulgarian Empire , in part because of similarity between Justinian @-@ era churches from the 6th century and what may have been a revival of that style in the late 9th and early 10th centuries under the Christianized Bulgar tsars . Remains of the Round Church in Preslav , a building traditionally associated with the rule Tsar Simeon ( 893 – 927 ) , indicate that it was a domed palace chapel . Its construction features , however , resemble instead 3rd and 4th century Roman mausolea , perhaps due to the association of those structures with the imperial idea . 
 Byzantine architecture was introduced to the Rus ' people in the 10th century , with churches after the conversion of Prince Vladimir of Kiev being modeled after those of Constantinople , but made of wood . The Russian onion dome was a later development . The earliest architecture of Kiev , the vast majority of which was made of wood , has been lost to fire , but by the 12th century masonry domes on low drums in Kiev and Vladimir @-@ Suzdal were little different than Byzantine domes , although modified toward the " helmet " type with a slight point . The Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev ( 1018 – 37 ) was distinctive in having thirteen domes , for Jesus and the twelve Apostles , but they have since been remodeled in the Baroque style and combined with an additional eight domes . The pyramidal arrangement of the domes was a Byzantine characteristic , although , as the largest and perhaps most important 11th century building in the Byzantine tradition , many of the details of this building have disputed origins . <unk> onion domes on tall drums were a development of northern Russia , perhaps due to the demands of heavy ice and snowfall along with the more rapid innovation permitted by the Novgorod region 's emphasis on wooden architecture . The central dome of the Cathedral of St. Sophia ( 1045 – 62 ) in Novgorod dates from the 12th century and shows a transitional stage . Other churches built around this time are those of St. Nicholas ( 1113 ) , the Nativity of the Virgin ( 1117 ) , and St. George ( 1119 – 30 ) . 
 In Romanesque Italy , Byzantine influence can most clearly be seen in Venice 's St Mark 's Basilica , from about 1063 , but also in the domed churches of southern Italy , such as <unk> Cathedral ( 1071 ) and the old Cathedral of <unk> ( c . 1160 ) . In Norman Sicily , architecture was a fusion of Byzantine , Islamic , and Romanesque forms , but the dome of the Palatine Chapel ( 1132 – 43 ) at Palermo was decorated with Byzantine mosaic , as was that of the church of Santa Maria dell <unk> ( 1140 's ) . The unusual use of domes on pendentives in a series of seventy Romanesque churches in the Aquitaine region of France strongly suggests a Byzantine influence . St. Mark 's Basilica was modeled on the now @-@ lost Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople , and <unk> Cathedral in Aquitaine ( c . 1120 ) likewise has five domes on pendentives in a Greek cross arrangement . Other examples include the a domed naves of Angoulême Cathedral ( 1105 – 28 ) , <unk> Cathedral ( c . 1100 – 1119 ) , and the Abbey church of Sainte @-@ Marie in Souillac ( c . 1130 ) . 
 Byzantium 's neighboring Orthodox powers emerged as architectural centers in their own right during the Late Byzantine Period . The Bulgarian churches of Nesebar are similar to those in Constantinople at this time and , following the construction of Gračanica monastery , the architecture of Serbia used the " so @-@ called <unk> plan " , for example at <unk> ( 1375 – 7 ) . In Romania , Wallachia was influenced by Serbian architecture and Moldavia was more original , such as in the <unk> Monastery with its small dome . Moscow emerged as the most important center of architecture following the fall of Constantinople in 1453 . The Cathedral of the Assumption ( 1475 – 79 ) , built in the Kremlin to house the icon of Our Lady of Vladimir , was designed in a traditional Russian style by an Italian architect . 
 Italian Renaissance architecture combined Roman and Romanesque practices with Byzantine structures and decorative elements , such as domes with pendentives over square bays . The <unk> Congregation used windowed domes in the Byzantine style , and often also in a quincunx arrangement , in their churches built between 1490 and 1546 , such as the Abbey of Santa Giustina . The technique of using wooden tension rings at several levels within domes and drums to resist deformation , frequently said to be a later invention of Filippo Brunelleschi , was common practice in Byzantine architecture . The technique of using double shells for domes , although revived in the Renaissance , originated in Byzantine practice . The dome of the Pantheon , as a symbol of Rome and its monumental past , was particularly celebrated and imitated , although copied only loosely . Studied in detail from the early Renaissance on , it was an explicit point of reference for the dome of St. Peter 's Basilica and inspired the construction of domed rotundas with temple @-@ front porches throughout western architecture into the modern era . Examples include Palladio 's chapel at Maser ( 1579 – 80 ) , Bernini 's church of S. Maria dell <unk> ( 1662 @-@ 4 ) , the Library Rotunda of the University of Virginia ( 1817 – 26 ) , and the church of St. Mary in Malta ( 1833 – 60 ) . 
 Ottoman architecture adopted the Byzantine dome form and continued to develop it . One type of mosque was modeled after Justinian 's Church of Sergius and Bacchus with a dome over an octagon or hexagon contained within a square , such as the <unk> <unk> Mosque ( 1437 – 47 ) . The dome and semi @-@ domes of the Hagia Sophia , in particular , were replicated and refined . A " universal mosque design " based upon this development spread throughout the world . The first Ottoman mosque to use a dome and semi @-@ dome nave vaulting scheme like that of Hagia Sophia was the mosque of <unk> II . Only two others were modeled similarly : Kılıç Ali Pasha Mosque and the Süleymaniye Mosque ( 1550 – 57 ) . Other Ottoman mosques , although superficially similar to Hagia Sophia , have been described as structural criticism 's of it . When Mimar Sinan set out to build a dome larger than that of Hagia Sophia with Selimiye Mosque ( 1569 – 74 ) , he used a more stable octagonal supporting structure . The Selimiye Mosque is of the type originating with the Church of Sergius and Bacchus . Three other Imperial mosques in Istanbul built in this " Classical Style " of Hagia Sophia include four large semi @-@ domes around the central dome , rather than two : Şehzade Camii , Sultan Ahmed I Camii ( completed in 1616 ) , and the last to be built : Yeni <unk> ( 1597 – 1663 ) . 
 A Byzantine revival style of architecture occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries . An early example of the revival style in Russia was the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour ( 1839 – 84 ) , which was approved by the Tsar to be a model for other churches in the empire . The style 's popularity spread through scholarly publications produced after the independence of Greece and the Balkans from the Ottoman Empire . It was used throughout Europe and North America , peaking in popularity between 1890 and 1914 . The Greek Orthodox St Sophia 's Cathedral ( 1877 – 79 ) and Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral ( begun 1895 ) , both in London , are examples . The throne room of Neuschwanstein Castle ( 1885 – 86 ) was built by King Ludwig II in Bavaria . In the late 19th century , the Hagia Sophia became a widespread model for Greek Orthodox churches . In southeastern Europe , monumental national cathedrals built in the capital cities of formerly Ottoman areas used Neo @-@ Classical or Neo @-@ Byzantine styles . Sofia 's Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and Belgrade 's Church of Saint Sava are examples , and used Hagia Sophia as a model due to their large sizes . Synagogues in the United States were built in a variety of styles , as they had been in Europe ( and often with a mixture of elements from different styles ) , but the Byzantine Revival style was the most popular in the 1920s . Domed examples include The Temple of Cleveland ( 1924 ) , the synagogue of <unk> Isaiah Israel ( 1924 ) in Chicago , based upon San Vitale in Ravenna and Hagia Sophia in Istanbul , and the synagogue of Congregation Emanu @-@ El ( 1926 ) in San Francisco . 
 In the United States , Greek Orthodox churches beginning in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia , rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types , such as the Greek @-@ cross @-@ octagon or five @-@ domed quincunx plans . Examples include Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church , completed in 1961 but designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957 , Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Oakland ( 1960 ) , and Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta ( 1967 ) . The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes , or versions of Early Christian basilicas .

 No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) squadron that operated during the Korean War and its immediate aftermath . It was established in October 1950 as part of No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing , which administered RAAF units deployed in the conflict . Apart from No. 391 Squadron , these included No. 77 ( Fighter ) Squadron , No. 30 Communications Unit ( redesignated No. 30 Transport Unit in 1951 and No. 36 ( Transport ) Squadron in 1953 ) , and No. 491 ( Maintenance ) Squadron . No. 391 Squadron was headquartered at Iwakuni , Japan , as were No. 91 Wing 's other components with the exception of No. 77 Squadron , which was located on the Korean peninsula . The base squadron was responsible for administrative , logistical , medical , communications and security functions at Iwakuni , and also maintained detachments in South Korea . It included a marine section for harbour patrols and search @-@ and @-@ rescue in the waters off southern Japan . No. 391 Squadron was disbanded at the same time as No. 91 Wing headquarters , in April 1955 .

 When the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950 , No. 77 ( Fighter ) Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) was based at Iwakuni , Japan . For the previous four years the squadron , equipped with North American P @-@ 51 Mustangs , had served with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) . Personnel were preparing to return to Australia when they were placed on standby for action over Korea ; the squadron began flying missions as part of United Nations ( UN ) forces a week later . Following the landing at Inchon and the consequent advance northward of UN troops , No. 77 Squadron relocated to Pohang , South Korea , on 12 October 1950 . It left behind its main support elements at Iwakuni . No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing was established at the base on 20 October and given administrative responsibility for all RAAF units operating during the conflict . This included No. 77 Squadron and three newly formed components : No. 30 Communications Flight ( renamed No. 30 Communications Unit the following month , No. 30 Transport Unit in November 1951 and No. 36 ( Transport ) Squadron in March 1953 ) , No. 491 ( Maintenance ) Squadron , and No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron . Apart from No. 77 Squadron , the wing 's units were all headquartered at Iwakuni . 
 At the onset of war in Korea , No. 77 Squadron was self @-@ supporting , the largest flying unit in the RAAF . It comprised 299 officers and men , 40 Mustangs , 3 CAC Wirraways , 2 Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas and 2 Austers . The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea , leading to the formation of No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron at Iwakuni , at the same time as No. 91 Wing headquarters . RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative , logistical , medical , communications and security functions . Staffed mainly by former No. 77 Squadron members , in the first year of its existence No. 391 Squadron had to try to overcome severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment . Further problems arose when No. 77 Squadron converted to Gloster Meteors between April and July 1951 , as spares for the British @-@ made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang . No longer could No. 391 Squadron source parts from the US Fifth Air Force as it had up till this point . Disposal of the Mustangs and their spares also caused headaches ; the process took two years , causing storage issues . The base squadron faced another challenge in January 1952 , following a controversial change in role for the Meteors , from air @-@ to @-@ air combat to ground attack , which necessitated obtaining supplies of rockets and modification of the aircraft to carry them . 
 Along with its RAAF responsibilities , No. 391 Squadron supported Australian Army and other UN personnel travelling through Iwakuni . It ran No. 91 Wing 's " Transit Hotel " , which accommodated business people and entertainers , as well as military personnel . The squadron maintained two detachments in South Korea , one at Kimpo Air Base to handle Meteor spares , and another at the RAAF ward of the British Commonwealth Zone Medical Unit in Seoul . Base support staff regularly rotated from Iwakuni to these detachments . No. 391 Squadron 's medical contingent was heavily engaged in the preparation and escort of injured personnel from Korea to Iwakuni and then to other destinations . The unit included a marine craft section equipped with small boats that patrolled harbours in southern Japan used by British and American flying boats , and conducted search @-@ and @-@ rescue operations for UN pilots who ditched at sea . No. 391 Squadron used Japanese technicians as well as Australian , which was unusual at the time ; since the occupation of Japan following its surrender in World War II , Japanese workers had only been employed for menial tasks . 
 Following the departure for Australia of Nos. 77 and 36 Squadrons between November 1954 and March 1955 , and the disbandment of No. 491 Squadron in December 1954 , No. 391 Squadron disbanded on 30 April 1955 , the same day as No. 91 Wing headquarters .

 While " celebrating the finalization of his divorce " , Robert ( James Spader ) drunkenly shuts down the Binghamton branch of Dunder Mifflin . The resulting commotion allows the sales team in Scranton , specifically Jim ( John Krasinski ) and Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) to begin poaching former customers of the closed branch . Harry <unk> ( Chris Bauer ) , an angry employee from the Syracuse branch of Dunder Mifflin arrives in Scranton to berate Jim and Dwight for taking New York clients even though those particular clients are closer to Scranton than Syracuse . The two argue , dropping the name of a particularly large client , Prestige Direct Sale Solutions , that is up for grabs . Andy ( Ed Helms ) , who is cooking lunch for everyone in the office , overhears the argument and gets an idea : if he can win the client , he might be able to use the account as leverage to get his job as manager back . 
 Andy rushes to the potential client , a company called Prestige Direct , and impresses the CEO ( Dan Castellaneta ) with his dedication — in addition to his personal phone number , he also gives him a copy of his house key . Meanwhile , Dwight , Jim , and Harry rush to the company in an attempt to win the client , only to hear that the company has gone with Andy . After Andy wins the client , he calls Robert and offers him the client if Robert will re @-@ hire him . Robert is furious at his attempt to blackmail him , and hangs up on Andy . This leads Andy to seek help from David Wallace ( Andy Buckley ) , the former Chief Financial Officer of Dunder Mifflin who has become a multi @-@ millionaire . Andy tells David that , despite being in poor shape , Dunder Mifflin could be worth twice its net worth if the company 's management is restructured . This piques David 's interest , who allows Andy to come into his home and talk to him about his business proposal . 
 Meanwhile , after Nellie Bertram ( Catherine Tate ) reveals to Robert that he sent her a sexually suggestive voicemail , Robert tasks Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) with finding what the voicemail entailed . Initially , Pam tries to trick Nellie into divulging the contents of the message , but this plan is ruined when Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) shows up , claiming that she was Robert 's " back @-@ up plan " in case Pam failed . Finally , Pam steals Nellie 's phone and brings it to Robert and the two listen to the various voice messages . After hearing several which paint a life for Nellie that is sad and lonely — she is unable to adopt a child and she has maxed out her credit cards — Pam relents and tells Robert that she won 't help him anymore . Pam returns Nellie 's phone and the two strike up a conversation . Nellie reveals to Pam her disgust for Robert , saying that he is sexually obsessed . She asks Pam if she wants to hear about Robert 's voicemail , but Pam declines her offer . In the end , Nellie reveals to the camera that she is deeply moved to have a real friend at her work place . 
 After learning that they 've lost Prestige Direct , Jim , Dwight and Harry retreat outside for a coffee break . They end up having a conversation over what they would do with their lives , if they weren 't working for Dunder Mifflin . Jim jokingly says that he 'd be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane . Before he leaves , Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says they won 't be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months , leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim 's faces .

 The episode received mixed reviews from critics . Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it four out of five stars . Forcella praised the Jim – Dwight dynamic in the episode and wrote , " Jim and Dwight , and especially the latter , were terrific . " In addition , Forcella positively compared the character growth of Nellie <unk> to Michael Scott , noting " the most heartwarming moment [ was ] her scene with Pam , in which Nellie was so happy to have made a friend , reminded me of so many Michael Scott moments of the past . " Brett Harrison Davinger from The California Literary Review wrote moderately positive of the episode , saying , " Tonight 's episode worked for the most part thanks to the ever reliable Robert California and the usually reliable Jim and Dwight : Partners . " However , he did retroactively criticize season eight for not elaborating on the problems facing Dunder Mifflin until " Turf War " . In addition , he called the premise of Andy seeking Wallace 's help " iffy [ ... ] even if it was predictable " . Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave wrote , " The immediate , don 't over @-@ analyze opinion here is that ' Turf War ' is a top three episode of season 8 , with a chance of it being number one . " Furthermore , he concluded that the episode " was good , very good , and a nice way to get set for the season / series finale . [ ... ] The Office can still bring it when it wants to . " 
 Myles McNutt from The A. V. Club wrote a mixed review and gave it a C + . He noted that the episode 's closing scene , wherein Jim , Dwight , and Harry talk about Robert California ruining the company , was an example of a retcon that " the shift to a world with actual consequences is certainly a step in the right direction for the series , and one that slightly elevates ' Turf War ' if not the season as a whole . " However , McNutt was largely critical of the writing , noting that the closure of the Binghamton branch was a " cheap segue " that " render [ ed ] the show 's characters as subservient to the narrative whims of the writers . " He argued — specifically citing the <unk> that the Scranton employees showed after hearing that a neighboring branch was shut down — that many of the characters ' motives were not effective because they simply acted as ciphers , through which the larger plots could unfold . 
 Several reviews were critical of Andy 's paper company development . Many compared it , unfavorably , to the Michael Scott Paper Company fifth season story arc . <unk> <unk> from TV Equals wrote " Instead [ of Andy making a mention to the Michael Scott Paper Company ] the similarities were ignored and we were expected to treat this as a novel idea . " Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times sardonically wrote " remember how good the Michael Scott Paper Company storyline was ? " a reference to the episode 's reuse of an old and existing story arc . In addition , several reviews criticized the cold opening . California Literary noted that , " The string of good , relatable cold opens ends tonight as Dwight and Gabe engage in a manliest man contest . " Myles McNutt called the scene " just nonsense " .

 The New Harmony Toll Bridge , also known as the Harmony Way Bridge , is a now @-@ closed two @-@ lane bridge across the Wabash River that connects Illinois Route 14 with Indiana State Road 66 , which is Church Street in New Harmony , Indiana . The bridge links White County , Illinois with Posey County , Indiana . The four @-@ span bridge is owned by the White County Bridge Commission and was built without federal funds in 1930 by the Big Wabash Bridge Company of <unk> , Illinois . The next bridge across the Wabash about 15 miles ( 24 km ) downstream is the Wabash Memorial Bridge near Mount Vernon , Indiana and the next bridge upstream is for Interstate 64 , which does not allow farm vehicles . 
 = = Details = = 
 As originally designed , the bridge is 2 @,@ 579 feet ( <unk> of a mile ) long . It has 47 spans and a 20 foot wide concrete roadway . 
 The bridge is the first highway bridge erected across the lower Wabash River and the oldest remaining bridge in use over the Wabash ’ s length in Illinois and half of Indiana . The original owner was a private company , the Big Wabash Bridge Company of <unk> , Illinois , which was chartered by Congress to build and operate the bridge on May 1 , 1928 . The company contracted with the Nashville Bridge Company of Nashville , Tennessee to build it . The bridge opened on December 21 , 1930 , and 10 @,@ 000 people attended the dedication of the bridge on December 30 , 1930 . In 1941 , Congress created the White County Bridge Commission as a joint Illinois @-@ Indiana agency to purchase the bridge from the Big Wabash Bridge Company for $ 895 @,@ 000 . 
 About 900 vehicles crossed the bridge each day . The bridge collected an average of $ 30 @,@ 000 in monthly tolls and had $ 22 @,@ 000 in monthly expenses . The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 in part because of its relationship to historic New Harmony , Indiana as well as the bridge 's age . The three @-@ member Commission was established by Congress on April 12 , 1941 , but Congress repealed the statute providing for an appointment mechanism in 1998 . The Commission 's general manager , who is 75 , speculated that the bridge would close if the three current commissioners would resign or die . 
 In 1951 , the current toll booth on the western edge of the river was constructed by the Electronic Signal Company , to replace an earlier booth on the eastern edge . In 1952 , a <unk> sued to exercise his right to inspect the books and records of the Commission , but lost his lawsuit and was not allowed access . In 1955 , the General Accounting Office issued a report critical of the Commission and claiming that one commissioner had a conflict of interest . In response , the U.S. Department of Justice filed a suit seeking removal of the Commissioner and recovery of the misapplied funds . However , the courts dismissed the case . 
 In 1994 , the Commission contracted to apply an epoxy coating on the bridge 's surface , but the coating <unk> and the Commission refused to pay the contractor claiming that the coating had not been applied correctly . After a trial , the Commission lost the lawsuit and paid . 
 From September 2007 to April 2008 , the bridge to closed to all traffic when cracks appeared in some of the concrete support piers . During the closure , contractors added new pilings to the existing piers and made other required repairs . In 2010 , engineers determined that the bridge required an additional $ 6 million in repairs . The National Bridge Inventory rated the bridge " Structurally Deficient . " 
 = = Closure = = 
 On May 21 , 2012 , it was announced that the bridge would close permanently at noon on May 29 , 2012 . White County Bridge Commission member Jim Clark stated , " the cost to make repairs was more than we could imagine . " However , Clark then made the decision to close the bridge immediately after receiving the complete report from a team of nine engineers who inspected the bridge on April 29 . " I knew it was bad , but didn 't know just how bad until I received their full report by email Monday morning , " Clark said . " Once I saw their weight @-@ load calculations , I knew we had to shut it down right away . We couldn 't wait until May 29 . " The thirteen toll booth employees were laid off . As of the closure there are $ 49 @,@ 015 in toll tickets that have not been used . <unk> were given for thirty days from the closure . The closure of the New Harmony Bridge as reported in the Evansville Courier would have a significant impact on farmers in the area and the oil industry .

All of the girls indulge in the brownies and Pandora is unhappy to see her mother 's behaviour grow increasingly erratic . After Angela is carried into a bedroom to sleep , Pandora locks herself in the bathroom , upset about Thomas 's departure and angry with Effy , who she believes spiked the brownies . 
 Outside , Cook and JJ Jones ( Ollie Barbieri ) try to sneak into the girls ' party . Cook enters the house through a window , but accidentally locks himself inside a wardrobe . After calling his friend , Freddie Mclair ( Luke Pasqualino ) , for help , JJ goes into the house by himself and sees Emily and Naomi kissing .

 = Wanderers F.C. = 
 Wanderers Football Club is an English amateur football club based in London . Founded as Forest Football Club in 1859 , the club changed its name to Wanderers in 1864 . Comprising mainly former pupils of the leading English public schools , Wanderers was among the dominant teams of the early years of organised football and won the Football Association Challenge Cup ( known in the modern era as the FA Cup ) on five occasions , including defeating Royal Engineers in the first FA Cup final in 1872 . 
 The club played only friendly matches until the advent of the FA Cup in 1871 , with the rules often differing from match to match as various sets of rules were in use at the time . Even after the formation of The Football Association ( the FA ) in 1863 , of which the club was among the founder members , Wanderers continued to play matches under other rules , but became one of the strongest teams playing by FA rules . They won the FA Cup three times in succession during the late 1870s , a feat which has only been repeated once . Among the players who represented the club were C. W. Alcock , the so @-@ called " father of modern sport " , and A.F. Kinnaird , regarded as the greatest player of his day . In keeping with its name , the club never had a home stadium of its own but played at various locations in London and the surrounding area . By the 1880s the club 's fortunes had declined and it was reduced to playing only an annual match against Harrow School , the alma mater of many of its founders . 
 The club was reformed in 2009 , reportedly with the endorsement of the descendants of the Alcock family , for the purposes of fundraising for UNICEF UK . Since 2011 , the revived club competes in the Surrey South Eastern Combination . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early years ( 1859 – 1871 ) = = = 
 The club was initially formed as Forest Football Club in 1859 by a number of former public school pupils , including C. W. Alcock , who had finished his education at Harrow School in the same year . The other founders were Alcock 's brother , John F. Alcock , J. Pardoe and brothers A. and W. J. Thompson . 
 For the first two years of the club 's existence , the players organised matches among themselves at Snaresbrook near Epping Forest , possibly on land owned by the Earl of Mornington . Forest 's first match against another club took place on 15 March 1862 , and resulted in a victory over Crystal Palace ( not the modern club of the same name ) . Both this match , and a return fixture between the two teams the following month , involved fifteen players on each team . At the time , the rules of association football had not been codified , and many variants existed , differing in the number of players per team , whether players were permitted to play the ball with their hands , or the method of scoring goals . In 1863 the Forest club was among the founder members of The Football Association ( the FA ) and adopted the rules set down by that body , although they continued to play occasional matches under other sets of rules against clubs not affiliated to the FA . 
 The following year , the club played its first match under the name Wanderers Football Club , against No Names Club of Kilburn . Alcock had decided , possibly because of the expense the club was incurring by owning its own ground , to turn it into a " wandering " team with no fixed home venue , however it appears that some of the club 's members opposed this idea . For the following season teams operated under both names , with several players appearing for both , and indeed Forest and Wanderers even played each other in one match , but after 1865 there is no record of any further matches under the Forest name . The Wanderers initially fared well , losing only one of their sixteen matches in the 1865 – 66 season , but over the subsequent four seasons the team 's fortunes declined significantly and Alcock also found it increasingly difficult to ensure that eleven of his players actually turned up for a match , with the club often forced to play with fewer than the required number of players or borrow some from their opponents . During this period the club played a number of " home " matches at Battersea Park and Middlesex County Cricket Club 's Lillie Bridge Grounds . Wanderers subsequently made Kennington Oval its semi @-@ permanent home in 1869 . The club played 151 matches at The Oval . 
 = = = Cup success ( 1872 – 1878 ) = = = 
 In the 1870 – 71 season , the Wanderers finally turned around their fortunes , losing only five of thirty @-@ seven matches played . For the following season the FA , following a suggestion by Alcock , initiated the Football Association Challenge Cup , a knock @-@ out tournament open to all member clubs . Due to a combination of their opponents withdrawing and an unusual rule in place at the time which allowed both clubs to progress to the next round in the event of a draw , Wanderers only won one game in the four rounds leading up to the final , held at the Kennington Oval on 16 March 1872 . The club beat the Royal Engineers 1 – 0 to become the first ever winners of the cup , the winning goal being scored by Morton Betts , who was playing under the pseudonym " A. H. Chequer " . The following season , under the competition 's original rules , Wanderers , as holders , received a bye all the way to the final . In the final Wanderers beat Oxford University 2 – 0 to retain the cup , thanks in large part to the performance of A. F. Kinnaird . The club was unable to replicate this success over the next two seasons , although the team did manage a club record 16 – 0 victory over Farningham in the first round of the 1874 – 75 FA Cup . 
 In October 1875 , Wanderers travelled to Scotland for the first time , to play a match against the leading team from north of the border , Queen 's Park . Despite fielding their strongest team , Wanderers were outclassed by the Scots and lost 5 – 0 . The London club gained its revenge four months later , however , when Queen 's Park travelled to London for a re @-@ match and lost 2 – 0 . This was the first match the Glasgow club , which had been formed nine years earlier , had ever lost . Wanderers reached the semi @-@ finals of the FA Cup without conceding a goal and then defeated Swifts to set up a final against Old Etonians . The Etonians ' team contained five former Wanderers players , including Kinnaird . After the initial match finished in a 1 – 1 draw , Wanderers won the replay 3 – 0 to win the tournament for the third time . 
 The following season , with Kinnaird back in the team , Wanderers overcame indifferent early form to again reach the Cup final , and defeated Oxford University to retain the trophy . Wanderers again dominated the competition in the 1877 – 78 season , scoring nine goals in both their first and second round matches . The final was a rematch of the 1872 final and Wanderers again defeated Royal Engineers to win an unprecedented third consecutive FA Cup . The rules of the competition stated that under such circumstances the trophy would be retired and become the permanent property of the victorious club , but Alcock returned the cup to the FA on the condition that the rule be removed and no other team permitted to claim it on a permanent basis . Following the final , Wanderers played the reigning Scottish Cup holders , Vale of Leven , but lost 3 – 1 . 
 = = = Decline ( 1879 – 1887 ) = = = 
 The Wanderers ' fortunes declined rapidly following the club 's hat @-@ trick of FA Cup wins . By 1878 , football clubs had been set up for former pupils of all the leading public schools , and many leading players chose to play for their respective old boys ' team instead . Wanderers ' fixture list was dramatically reduced in the 1878 – 79 season , and the team was knocked out of the FA Cup in the first round , losing 7 – 2 to an Old Etonians team led by Kinnaird . The following season Wanderers managed to reach the third round of the Cup , but lost again to the Etonians , after which many more key players left the club . 
 The club struggled on into the 1880 – 81 season , but was forced to withdraw from the FA Cup after being unable to raise a team for the scheduled first round match . After 1881 , the club was reduced to playing only one match per year , against Harrow School each Christmas . A book published by the newspaper The Sportsman claimed that the club folded in 1884 , however a match at Harrow was reported in The Times in December 1887 , which Harrow won 3 – 1 . 
 = = = Reformation ( 2009 – present ) = = = 
 In 2009 , over 120 years after the last known Wanderers match , a " reformed " Wanderers club was founded in London , reportedly with the approval of descendants of those involved with the original club , with the intention to play occasional matches for charity . In 2011 the club joined the Surrey South Eastern Combination . On 7 November 2012 , the team played the Royal Engineers at The Oval in a rematch of the 1872 FA Cup Final , 140 years after the original event , losing 7 – 1 . 
 Wanderers gained promotion from the Combination 's Junior Division 4 in 2013 , after finishing as runners @-@ up . In 2014 they achieved a second consecutive promotion after being crowned champions of the Junior Division 3 .

 Wanderers are known to have played in orange , purple , and black for at least part of their existence , although as no photographs of the team exist , the exact design is not known . A replica shirt sold in the modern era has the three colours in horizontal stripes , a likely arrangement given that horizontally @-@ striped shirts were very common during the Victorian era . The programme for the club 's 1875 away match with Queen 's Park , however , lists Wanderers as playing in white shirts . In the absence of shirt numbering , which would not be introduced for another sixty years , the programme identifies the individual players by the colours of their stockings ( socks ) or caps , with Alcock and Kinnaird both listed as wearing blue and white caps and Jarvis Kenrick identified by his <unk> and French grey cap , the colours of his former club Clapham Rovers . The modern club 's crest is derived from the Harrow School crest , which may have adorned the shirts of the original team .

 Wanderers played firstly at Snaresbrook near Epping Forest , reputedly close to one of two orphanages in the area ; the Infant Orphan Asylum in Snaresbrook or the Merchant Seaman 's Orphan Asylum in nearby Wanstead . Wanderers played at several locations between 1859 and 1887 throughout London , but predominantly at Kennington Oval ( 151 games ) , Vincent Square ( 31 ) , Harrow ( 23 ) , Harrow School ( 15 ) and Clapham Common ( 12 ) . Battersea Park has been erroneously attributed as Wanderers home ground , however Wanderers played just 10 games there between 1864 and 1867 .

 Prior to the formation of The Football Association in 1863 , individual schools played football according to their own particular rules . Due to the connection Wanderers had with Harrow School , the school 's football team played Wanderers frequently – 33 games between the two were recorded between 1865 and 1883 . Among the club 's other regular opponents were Royal Engineers , Clapham Rovers and Civil Service .

 Although records are incomplete , C. W. Alcock is believed to have played the most matches for the Wanderers , with at least 199 appearances , and to have scored the most goals , with at least 82 . He also recorded the highest goalscoring total for an individual season , with 17 known goals in the 1870 – 71 season , including four in a 6 – 1 win over Civil Service . R. K. Kingsford bettered that feat when he scored five goals against Farningham in 1874 , the most goals scored by a Wanderers player in a single match . The 16 – 0 margin of victory in the Farningham match was by far the largest win achieved by Wanderers , with no other scores in double @-@ figures recorded . The most goals conceded by Wanderers was eight , in an 8 – 2 defeat to Clapham Rovers in 1879 ; the club also lost by a six @-@ goal margin on at least one other occasion , a 6 – 0 defeat to Queen 's Park in 1876 .

 = Bob Marshall ( wilderness activist ) = 
 Robert " Bob " Marshall ( January 2 , 1901 – November 11 , 1939 ) was an American forester , writer and wilderness activist . The son of Louis Marshall , a wealthy constitutional lawyer and conservationist , and his wife , Bob Marshall developed a love for the outdoors as a young child . A consummate hiker and climber , he visited the Adirondack Mountains frequently during his youth , ultimately becoming one of the first Adirondack Forty @-@ Sixers . He also traveled to the Alaskan wilderness and wrote numerous articles and books , including the bestselling 1933 book Arctic Village . 
 A scientist with a Doctor of Philosophy in plant physiology , Marshall became independently wealthy after the death of his father . He held two significant public appointed posts : chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs , from 1933 to 1937 , and head of recreation management in the Forest Service , from 1937 to 1939 , during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt . 
 Defining wilderness as a social as well as an environmental ideal , Marshall promoted organization of a national group dedicated to the preservation of primeval land . In 1935 , he was one of the principal founders of The Wilderness Society and personally provided most of the Society 's funding in its first years . He also supported socialism and civil liberties throughout his life . 
 Marshall died of heart failure at the age of 38 . Twenty @-@ five years later , partly as a result of his efforts , The Wilderness Society fostered the Wilderness Act , which legally defined the wilderness of the United States and protected some nine million acres ( 36 @,@ 000 km2 ) of federal land . Today , Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement . Several landmarks and areas , including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks , have been named in his honor . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Born in New York City , Bob Marshall was the third of four children of Louis Marshall ( 1856 – 1929 ) and Florence ( née Lowenstein ) Marshall ( 1873 – 1916 ) . His father , the son of a Jewish immigrant from Bavaria , was a noted constitutional lawyer and a champion of minority rights . The family moved to Syracuse , New York , where Louis Marshall was active in the Jewish community , and co @-@ founder of the American Jewish Committee . In 1891 , he was part of a national delegation that sought federal intervention on behalf of persecuted Russian Jews . 
 An amateur naturalist and active conservationist , the elder Marshall was instrumental in securing " forever wild " protection for the Adirondack and Catskill Forest Preserves in New York State . He helped found the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University , now SUNY @-@ ESF . Florence Marshall , meanwhile , devoted herself to her family , the education of young Jewish women , and the work of several Jewish welfare organizations . 
 Bob Marshall attended Felix Adler 's private Ethical Culture School in New York City until 1919 . The school nurtured independent thinking and commitment to social justice . Marshall became involved in nature from a young age ; two of his childhood heroes were Meriwether Lewis and William Clark . His family took him to the Adirondack Mountains when he was six months old ; they returned every summer for the next 25 years . After that , Marshall returned often on his own . His younger brother George later described the family 's visits to Knollwood , their summer camp on Lower Saranac Lake in the Adirondack State Park , as a time when they " entered a world of freedom and informality , of living plants and spaces , of fresh greens and exhilarating blues , of giant , slender pines and delicate pink <unk> , of deer and mosquitoes , of fishing and guide boats and tramps through the woods " . 
 = = Schooling and early exploring = = 
 Marshall was drawn to the outdoors . He discovered his passion for exploring , charting , and a love of climbing mountains , in part through the writings of Verplanck Colvin , who during the post @-@ Civil War decade surveyed the woods of northern New York . Throughout his life , Marshall kept a series of hiking notebooks , which he illustrated with photographs and filled with statistics . In 1915 , Marshall climbed his first Adirondack peak , the 3 @,@ 352 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 022 m ) Ampersand Mountain , alongside his brother George and family friend Herb Clark , a Saranac Lake guide . Through Clark , who accompanied them on most of their longer trips during adolescence and early adulthood , the two brothers learned the arts of woodcraft and boating . By 1921 , they became the first climbers to scale all 42 Adirondack Mountains believed to exceed 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) , some of which had never been climbed . In 1924 , the three became the first Adirondack Forty @-@ Sixers , hikers who have climbed to the summits of all 46 High Peaks of the Adirondacks . 
 After graduating from the Ethical Culture School , Marshall spent a year at Columbia University . In 1920 , he transferred to the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University . Marshall had decided in his teens that he wanted to be a forester , writing then about his love of " the woods and solitude ; " he wrote that he " should hate to spend the greater part of my lifetime in a stuffy office or in a crowded city " . For a while he was unhappy and withdrawn at Syracuse . But , he succeeded academically and was known for his individuality . As one classmate put it , Marshall was " always doing something no one else would ever think of doing . He was constantly rating things — the Adirondack peaks , his best days with George , and dozens of others . " Marshall became a member of Alpha Xi Sigma , the forestry college 's honor society . He ran on the Syracuse University freshman track team and participated in both junior varsity lacrosse and cross country running . Halfway through school , Marshall had become a class leader ; he was elected as class secretary and appointed an associate editor of the Empire Forester , the College 's yearbook . 
 During the early 1920s , Marshall grew interested in promoting Adirondack recreation . In 1922 , he became one of the charter members of the Adirondack Mountain Club ( <unk> ) , an organization devoted to the building and maintenance of trails and the teaching of hiking in the park . In 1922 , he prepared a 38 @-@ page guidebook , entitled The High Peaks of the Adirondacks . Based on his pioneering experiences on the peaks , the guide recommends that " it 's a great thing these days to leave civilization for a while and return to nature . " Based on his own climbing experience , Marshall provided a brief description of each peak and arranged them in order of " niceness of view and all around pleasure in view and climb " . 
 In 1924 , Marshall graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in forestry , magna cum laude , finishing 4th of 59 at the College of Forestry . The senior yearbook described him as " the Champion Pond Hound of all time , a lad with a mania for statistics and <unk> mountain peaks , the boy who will go five miles [ 8 km ] around to find something to wade thru . And the man who is rear <unk> for Bob will have to hump or get wet , and probably both . " By 1925 , he earned a Master 's degree in forestry from Harvard University . 
 = = Forest Service and Alaska = = 
 Marshall started work in 1925 with the Forest Service , where he worked until 1928 . Hoping to go to Alaska , he was assigned to the Northern Rocky Mountain Experiment Station at Missoula , Montana , in 1925 . Marshall 's research at the Experimental Station focused on the dynamics of forest regeneration after fires . He had to fight a widespread fire after a July storm started more than 150 fires in Idaho 's Kaniksu National Forest . He was put in charge of supporting and provisioning one of the crews led by the Forest Service . As he later recalled , Marshall worked " 18 to 20 hours a day as time @-@ keeper , Chief of Commissary , Camp Boss , and Inspector of the fire line " . Spending time with loggers and fire fighters , and seeing the conditions under which they worked , Marshall learned vital lessons about labor issues and natural resource use . At the Experimental Station Marshall became interested in the unsafe conditions for many working Americans . He began to develop liberal and socialist philosophies . 
 In 1929 , Marshall was 28 years old and less than a year away from completing a PhD in plant pathology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , when he made his first trip to Alaska , visiting the upper Koyukuk River and the central Brooks Range . The scientific objective of the trip was to study tree growth at the northern timberline near the Arctic Divide . For his 15 @-@ month sojourn in the small town of Wiseman , Alaska , Marshall rented a one @-@ room cabin next to the only roadhouse in the village and furnished it with books , records , a phonograph player , and a writing desk . He placed the desk so that he could sit by the cabin 's single window and admire the view of the Koyukuk River and the range of steep , snow @-@ covered mountains in the background . His travels engendered in him a great love for the central Brooks Range in the Alaskan wilderness . Marshall was one of the first to explore much of the range , especially the headwaters of the North fork of the Koyukuk River , where he bestowed the name " Gates of the Arctic " on a pair of mountains . On September 11 , 1929 , Marshall 's father Louis died in Zürich , Switzerland at the age of 73 . Because their mother had died of cancer in 1916 , the four children inherited most of their father 's estate , worth several million dollars . Although he became financially independent , Bob Marshall continued to work throughout his life . 
 Marshall received his PhD in 1930 , under the supervision of Dr. Burton E. Livingston at the Johns Hopkins Laboratory of Plant Physiology . Marshall 's doctoral dissertation was titled " An Experimental Study of the Water Relations of Seedling Conifers with Special Reference to <unk> " . In February 1930 , his essay " The Problem of the Wilderness " was published ; a celebrated defense of wilderness preservation , the essay expanded themes developed in his earlier article , " The Wilderness as a Minority Right " . Though rejected by four other magazines before it was published in The Scientific Monthly , the essay has become one of Marshall 's most important works . He argued that wilderness was worth saving not only because of its unique aesthetic qualities , but because of its ability to provide visitors with a chance for adventure . Marshall went on to state : " There is just one hope of repulsing the tyrannical ambition of civilization to conquer every niche on the whole earth . That hope is the organization of spirited people who will fight for the freedom of the wilderness . " The article became a much @-@ quoted call to action and is today considered seminal by wilderness historians . 
 In July 1930 , Marshall and his brother George climbed nine Adirondack High Peaks in one day , setting a new record . In August , Marshall returned to Alaska . He planned to explore the Brooks Range to pursue more tree research , and he also wanted to make a study of Arctic frontier civilization in Wiseman . He called the village , which was 200 miles north of Fairbanks , " the happiest civilization of which I have knowledge . " Befriending a number of the area 's inhabitants , he meticulously recorded thousands of hours of conversation with them . He persuaded a number of villagers , most of whom were single males , to take intelligence tests , and even developed statistics on all aspects of the villagers ' lives , from their financial resources to their diets to their sexual habits . He spent 12 @-@ 1 / 2 months — from late August 1930 to early September 1931 — exploring and collecting data . The book that resulted from these excursions ( and his previous trip to Alaska ) was 1933 's best @-@ selling Literary Guild selection , Arctic Village . Marshall shared the royalties from the book , a sociological study of life in the wilderness , with the residents of Wiseman . 
 = = Writing and conservation = = 
 Marshall returned to the east coast in late September 1931 . Although he busied himself with writing Arctic Village , he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles about American forestry . In particular , he had concerns that few articles during this time addressed the issue of deforestation , and he went so far as to write a letter to the president of the American Forestry Association , George D. Pratt , on the matter . He also pursued a variety of other activities : he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial ( Louis Marshall Memorial Hall ) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse , and delivered speeches about his travels and wilderness preservation . 
 Shortly after his return , he was asked by Earle Clapp , head of the Forest Service 's Branch of Research , to help initiate badly needed reforms in the forest @-@ products industry and to create a broader vision of national forest management . Marshall moved to Washington , D.C. in September 1932 to assume the position , which entailed writing initiatives for forest recreation , and immediately began compiling a list of the remaining roadless areas in the United States . He sent this data to regional foresters , urging them to set aside areas for wilderness ; all of them responded negatively . Marshall 's input into what became known as the Copeland Report amounted to three extensive chapters of a two volume , 1 @,@ 677 @-@ page work . He considered it " the best piece of forestry work I have yet done " . 
 Marshall had clearly defined himself as a socialist by 1932 – 1933 . He told a correspondent : " I wish very sincerely that Socialism would be put into effect right away and the profit system eliminated . " He became active in the Tenants Unemployed League of the District of Columbia , a group that helped unemployed people with housing problems ; later he joined the fight against federal aid cuts to scientific research . Learning of the American Civil Liberties Union from his father , he served as chairman of the Washington branch . Marshall was even arrested briefly for participating in a March 1933 United Front demonstration . He did not forget his conservation causes , however , and soon pondered the question of wilderness and national parks . In the early 1930s , he joined the National Parks Association , eventually becoming a member of its board . 
 In August 1933 , Marshall was appointed director of the Forestry Division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) , a position he held for four years . He besieged government personnel with letters , telephone calls , and personal visits in the cause of wilderness , rapidly gaining recognition in Washington as a champion of preservation . One of his last initiatives as chief forester of the BIA was to recommend 4 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 acres ( 19 @,@ 425 km2 ) of Indian lands for management as either " roadless " or " wild " areas ; the order , which created 16 wilderness areas , received approval shortly after Marshall left office to join the Forest Service once more . Marshall became increasingly concerned with civilization 's encroachment upon the wild lands , writing : " The sounds of the forest are entirely obliterated by the roar of the motor . The smell of pine needles and flowers and herbs and freshly turned dirt and all the other delicate odors of the forest are drowned in the stench of gasoline . The feeling of wind blowing in the face and of soft ground under foot are all lost . " 
 = = The Wilderness Society = = 
 In 1934 , Marshall visited Knoxville , Tennessee and met with Benton MacKaye , a regional planner and originator of the Appalachian Trail . Together with Harvey Broome , a Knoxville lawyer , they discussed Marshall 's 1930 proposal for an organization dedicated to wilderness preservation . Bernard Frank , a fellow forester , joined them later in the year ; the men mailed an " Invitation to Help Organize a Group to Preserve the American Wilderness " to like @-@ minded individuals . The invitation expressed their desire " to integrate the growing sentiment which we believe exists in this country for holding wild areas sound @-@ proof as well as sight @-@ proof from our increasingly mechanized life " and their conviction that such wildernesses were " a serious human need rather than a luxury and plaything " . 
 On January 21 , 1935 , the organizing committee published a folder stating that " for the purpose of fighting off invasion of the wilderness and of stimulating ... an appreciation of its multiform emotional , intellectual , and scientific values , we are forming an organization to be known as the <unk> SOCIETY " . They invited Aldo Leopold to act as the Society 's first president , but the position ultimately went to Robert Sterling Yard . Marshall provided the bulk of the Society 's funding in its early years , beginning with an anonymous donation of $ 1 @,@ 000 . His brother George was also deeply involved in the Society . 
 T. H. Watkins , former editor of the society 's magazine , Wilderness , contended that before Marshall and the Society there was " no true movement " for the preservation of the nation 's roadless and primitive areas . " One could comfortably argue " , Watkins wrote in 1985 on the occasion of the society 's 50th anniversary , " that Robert Marshall was personally responsible for the preservation of more wilderness than any individual in history " . 
 = = Later efforts and sudden death = = 
 Marshall 's last years were productive ones . By May 1937 , he had taken charge of the Forest Service 's Division of Recreation and Lands . Over the next two years , Marshall worked on two major initiatives : an effort to extend national forest recreational opportunities to people with lower incomes ( as well as dismantling discriminatory barriers against minority groups ) , and a program to preserve more wilderness within the national forests . His biographer James Glover asserts that Marshall was probably the first high @-@ level official to seriously fight discrimination in Forest Service recreational policies . During this time , Marshall continued to financially support The Wilderness Society , as well as various civil rights , labor , and socialist organizations . 
 During his last trip to Alaska ( beginning in August 1938 ) , which included further exploration of the Brooks Range , Marshall became a subject of interest for the Dies Committee , a House of Representatives committee investigating " un @-@ American " activities . Named for its chairman , Martin Dies , the committee announced in The New York Times that eight federal officials ( including Marshall ) were contributing to communism because of their connections to such organizations as the Workers Alliance and the American League for Peace and Democracy . Marshall was too busy traveling to respond to the allegations : after leaving Alaska he spent time in Washington State , Montana , Oregon , Nevada , Utah , Arizona , New Mexico and California . He visited Alaska for one last time the following year and made a tour of western national forests , addressing aspects of forest recreation . While he was in Washington state that September , two regulations ( U @-@ 1 and U2 ) developed by Marshall 's committee were signed ; these " U @-@ Regulations " protected wilderness and wild areas from road building , logging , hotels and similarly destructive activities . It also made their protected status more secure . 
 While on a midnight train from Washington , D.C. to New York City on November 11 , 1939 , Marshall died of apparent heart failure at the age of 38 . His sudden death came as a shock because of his relatively young age and high level of physical activity , and he was greatly mourned by friends and relatives . His brother George ( who lived to be 96 ) said : " Bob 's death shattered me and was the most traumatic event in my life . " Marshall was interred at Salem Fields Cemetery , a Jewish burial ground in Brooklyn , New York City , beside his parents and sister Ruth ( <unk> ) Marshall , who had died of cancer at age 38 in 1936 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 A bachelor , Marshall left virtually all of his $ 1 @.@ 5 million estate ( equivalent to $ 25 million today ) to three causes dear to him : socialism , civil liberties and wilderness preservation . Three trusts were established in his will . The first , focused on education related to " the theory of production for use and not for profit " , received half of his estate ; the second , aimed at " safeguarding and advancement of the cause of civil liberties " , received one @-@ quarter of his estate ; and the third supported " preservation of the wilderness conditions in outdoor America " , establishing what became the Robert Marshall Wilderness Fund . Trustees of the latter trust included Robert Sterling Yard , Bob Marshall 's brother George , Irving Clark , Olaus Murie and Bill Zimmerman , early leaders of The Wilderness Society . He left money to only one individual : $ 10 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 168 @,@ 109 today ) to his old friend and guide , Herb Clark . 
 Marshall 's posthumously published book Alaska Wilderness , Exploring the Central Brooks Range ( 1956 ) , edited by his brother George , became a seminal work , inspiring the establishment of the Gates of the Arctic National Park . His Adirondack writings were published by Lost Pond Press in 2006 , as an anthology titled Bob Marshall in the Adirondacks : Writings of a Pioneering Peak @-@ Bagger , Pond @-@ Hopper and Wilderness <unk> . It was edited by Phil Brown , editor of the Adirondack Explorer news magazine . According to the publisher , the book includes " numerous accounts of his hikes in the High Peaks and the vast wild region south of Cranberry Lake , spirited defenses of the state 's forever @-@ wild Forest Preserve , a charming portrait of Herb Clark , and excerpts from an unpublished novel set partly in the Adirondacks " . 
 Since its conception , The Wilderness Society has helped pass many bills and has contributed a total of 109 million acres ( 421 @,@ 000 km2 ) to the National Wilderness Preservation System . Marshall 's dream of permanent wilderness protection became a reality 25 years after his death when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law on September 3 , 1964 in the Rose Garden of the White House . The ceremony was attended by Alice Zahniser and Mardy Murie , the widows of two prominent members of The Wilderness Society . Written by Howard Zahniser , the bill enabled the United States Congress to set aside selected areas in the national forests , national parks , national wildlife refuges and other federal lands as units to be kept permanently unchanged by humans . In defining wilderness , Zahniser invoked Marshall and his contemporaries , stating that " in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape , [ wilderness ] is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man , where man himself is a visitor who does not remain . " The act 's signing was the most important event in the history of The Wilderness Society ; members Mardy Murie and Alice Zahniser stood beside Johnson as he signed the legislation . With The Wilderness Act , the United States guaranteed permanent protection of wild and scenic natural areas for future generations . The Society 's most prestigious honor , the Robert Marshall Award , is named in Marshall 's honor ; its first recipient was Sigurd F. Olson in 1981 . 
 = = = Places and dedications = = = 
 In the same year that the Wilderness Act became law , the Bob Marshall Wilderness , located in Flathead and Lewis and Clark National Forests in Montana , was created . It had previously been set aside in 1941 as the South Fork , Pentagon , and Sun River Primitive Areas . The area encompasses a million acres ( 4 @,@ 000 km2 ) and is one of the best preserved ecosystems in the world . Known as " The Bob , " it is the fifth largest wilderness in the contiguous 48 states . In compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act , there is no motorized or mechanical equipment ( including bicycles or hang gliders ) permitted . Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit , no roads exist in the area , and logging and mining are prohibited . There are a number of US Forest Service cabins in the Bob for use by Forest Service personnel . The Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex ( which encompasses Bob Marshall , Scapegoat , and Great Bear <unk> ) is a habitat for the grizzly bear , lynx , cougar , wolf , black bear , moose , elk and a variety of other birds , mammals , and plants . 
 Mount Marshall ( previously called Mount Herbert ) , which stands 4 @,@ 360 feet ( 1 @,@ 330 m ) high in the Adirondack Mountains , Camp Bob Marshall in the Black Hills , and Marshall Lake in the Brooks Range of Alaska , north of the Arctic Circle , are also named for him . In 2008 , the Adirondack Council was encouraging the state of New York to create the Bob Marshall Great Wilderness near Cranberry Lake in the western Adirondacks ; if successful , it would be the largest wilderness area in the Adirondack Park at 409 @,@ 000 acres ( 639 sq mi ; 1 @,@ 655 km2 ) . 
 At the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry ( SUNY @-@ ESF ) , Bob Marshall Fellowships in wilderness management and policy studies are offered to graduate students and faculty engaged in research in recreation resource management ; the fellowships are supported by the college 's Bob Marshall Endowed Fund . Also at SUNY @-@ ESF , a student " outing club " named after Marshall honors his love of the outdoors and the Adirondack mountains , and a bronze plaque commemorating his contributions to wilderness conservation graces the entrance way of Marshall Hall , the hub of campus events and activities , named after his father .

 The Restless Spirit is a 1913 American silent short drama film written and directed by Allan Dwan , featuring J. Warren Kerrigan and Pauline Bush . The film is based on Thomas Gray 's 1751 poem , Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard , and tells the story of a man who wishes to be a conqueror . The Dreamer heads out into the desert and is nursed back to health by the Desert Flower . A series of illusions follows which shows the futility of conquest when he cannot conquer his own community . He returns and eventually becomes respected by the community that once ridiculed him . The film makes use of numerous dissolves which were technically difficult to execute , and reportedly sent the cameraman to the hospital due to stress . The film may have been the last unbilled appearance by Lon Chaney , and was released on October 27 , 1913 by Universal Film Manufacturing Company under the Victor label . The film is presumed lost .

 The groundwork for The Restless Spirit began when Allan Dwan visited Universal 's offices in New York in late July 1913 . Frederic Lombardi believes that it was during this meeting that Carl Laemmle offered Dwan 's colleagues double their pay from Flying A if they would come to Universal . In the following weeks , J. Warren Kerrigan came to Universal and the two would work together in the production of The Restless Spirit . Dwan credits the idea to adapt and produce a film on Thomas Gray 's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard as a betting challenge . Dwan also claimed to have studied Gray 's poem and dream about the production before accepting the challenge . Frederic Lombardi , author of Allan Dwan and the Rise and Decline of the Hollywood Studios , writes that Dwan may have been emboldened after the production of the Pickett Guard and the lack of structure in Gray 's poem . Since the poem had no " real story " , Dwan could formulate his own allegorical plot . Dwan was also able to convince his employers that the work would be a box office success and intended to use the film a prestigious multi @-@ role vehicle for Kerrigan 's debut at Universal . Lombardi writes that Dwan was subject to produce overtly artistic films , but these tendencies were kept in check by Dwan 's more practical inclinations . 
 The film 's ethereal aspects and double exposures were performed in the camera because the ability to create the effects in lab did not yet exist . Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film , each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had to be exact otherwise the shot would be ruined . Lombardi notes that the cinematographer , Walter Pritchard , was the man who had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said he was one of the company 's oldest men . Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end up in the hospital from the production . In The Parade 's Gone By , Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done . Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer was so nervous that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at the right spot before shots . This production may have been the last unbilled movie credit of Lon Chaney . The discovery of Lon Chaney 's role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head . Chaney wrote " This is me just below the X sign . Here I am a Russian Prince . " on the back of the still . The image still in particular leaves no question that it comes from the The Restless Spirit because it also appears on the cover of The Universal Weekly for October 23 , 1913 . The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a <unk> , which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film .

 On September 6 , 1913 , Motography reported that J. Warren Kerrigan would star in the upcoming picture known as A Restless Spirit with a reference to Kerrigan 's transfer to Universal . Alternate names for the film such as His Restless Spirit and A Restless Spirit . 
 It is unknown if the film was initially planned or if it was mere assumption , but it was reported that it would be a two reel production in September 1913 . Newspaper accounts change to reference the film as having three reels by October 3 , 1913 . As details spread in the newspaper , the film 's working title continued to be referenced as A Restless Spirit in various papers . Newspaper references began to reference the final title on October 24 , 1913 . The film was released on October 27 , 1913 by Universal Film Manufacturing Company under the Victor label . 
 With the film 's release on October 27 , it was of minor note that the Alcazar of Atlanta , Georgia would show the film until November 1 , 1913 . The film would be a special for the week at the Hippodrome in Leavenworth , Kansas . Some theaters , such as the Alamo of El Paso , Texas would only show the film for a single day . The Unique theater , also of El Paso , would show the film on October 29 due to a " slip @-@ up " with Universal 's New York office . The advertisement would also mention Kerrigan 's popularity in the area in otherwise apparent contrast to the Alamo 's single day run . Another advertisement noted the film 's artistry and that it is one of the best three @-@ reel films released , but the film would play for only a single day . The film received play in various theaters until at least July 1914 . 
 = = Reception and fate = = 
 Advertisements would state the films artistry or that it was one of the best three @-@ reel films released . Lombardi cites a single review from The Moving Picture World in his text and suggests that other reviews may have been more tepid , but the result was that Dwan would not produce any more films of " such experimental nature " at Universal . The film is now considered to be lost . It is unknown when the film was lost , but if it was in Universal 's vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal 's silent era films in 1948 .

 The Living Daylights ( 1987 ) is the fifteenth entry in the James Bond film series and the first to star Timothy Dalton as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond . The film 's title is taken from Ian Fleming 's short story , " The Living Daylights " . It was the last film to use the title of an Ian Fleming story until the 2006 instalment Casino Royale . 
 The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli , his stepson , Michael G. Wilson and his daughter , Barbara Broccoli . The Living Daylights was generally well received by most critics and was also a financial success , grossing $ 191 @.@ 2 million worldwide .

 James Bond is assigned to aid the defection of a KGB officer , General Georgi Koskov , covering his escape from a concert hall in Bratislava , Czechoslovakia during intermission . During the mission , Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to prevent Koskov 's escape is a female cellist from the orchestra . Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper , he instead shoots the rifle from her hands , then uses the Trans @-@ Siberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov across the border into Austria and then on to Britain . 
 In his post @-@ defection debriefing , Koskov informs MI6 that the KGB 's old policy of Smiert Spionom , meaning Death to Spies , has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin , the new head of the KGB . Koskov is later abducted from the safe @-@ house and assumed to have been taken back to Moscow . Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in Tangier and kill him to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West . Bond agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004 ( as depicted in the pre @-@ title sequence ) left a note bearing the same message , " Smiert Spionom " . 
 Bond returns to Bratislava to track down the cellist , Kara Milovy . He determines that Koskov 's entire defection was staged , and that Kara is actually Koskov 's girlfriend . Bond convinces Kara that he is a friend of Koskov 's and persuades her to accompany him to Vienna , supposedly to be reunited with him . They escape Bratislava while being pursued by the KGB , crossing over the border into Austria . Meanwhile , Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier , informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker . 
 During his brief tryst with Milovy in Vienna , Bond visits the Prater to meet his MI6 ally , Saunders , who discovers a history of financial dealings between Koskov and Whitaker . As he leaves their meeting , Saunders is killed by Koskov 's henchman Necros , who again leaves the message " Smiert Spionom " . 
 Bond and Kara promptly leave for Tangier , where Bond confronts Pushkin . Pushkin disavows any knowledge of " Smiert Spionom " , and reveals that Koskov is evading arrest for embezzlement of government funds . Bond and Pushkin then join forces and Bond fakes Pushkin 's assassination , inducing Whitaker and Koskov to progress with their scheme . Meanwhile , Kara contacts Koskov , who tells her that Bond is actually a KGB agent and convinces her to drug him so he can be captured . 
 Koskov , Necros , Kara , and the captive Bond fly to a Soviet air base in Afghanistan , where Koskov betrays Kara and imprisons her along with Bond . The pair escape and in doing so free a condemned prisoner , Kamran Shah , leader of the local Mujahideen . Bond and Milovy discover that Koskov is using Soviet funds to buy a massive shipment of opium from the Mujahideen , intending to keep the profits with enough left over to supply the Soviets with their arms and buy Western arms from Whitaker . 
 With the Mujahideen 's help , Bond plants a bomb aboard the cargo plane carrying the opium , but is spotted and has no choice but to barricade himself in the plane . Meanwhile , the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle . During the battle , Milovy drives a jeep into the back of the plane as Bond takes off , and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second . After a struggle , Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb . Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces . He re @-@ activates the bomb and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge , blowing it up and helping Shah and his men gain an important victory over the Soviets . Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker , infiltrating his estate with Leiter 's help , as Pushkin arrests Koskov , sending him back to Moscow . 
 Some time later , Kara is the solo cellist in a London performance . Kamran Shah and his men arrive during the intermission and are introduced to now @-@ diplomat General Gogol and the Russians . After her performance , Bond surprises her in her dressing room , and they embrace .

 = = Production = = 
 Originally the film was proposed to be a prequel in the series , an idea that eventually resurfaced with the reboot of the series in 2006 . SMERSH , the fictionalised Soviet counterintelligence agency that featured in Fleming 's Casino Royale and several other early James Bond novels , was an acronym for Smiert <unk> – " Death to spies " . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 In Autumn 1985 , following the financial and critical disappointment of A View to a Kill , work began on scripts for the next Bond film , with the intention that Roger Moore would not reprise the role of James Bond . Moore , who by the time of the release of The Living Daylights would have been 59 years old , chose to retire from the role after 12 years and 7 films . Albert Broccoli , however , claimed that he let Moore go from the role . A significant search for a new actor to play Bond saw a number of actors , including New Zealander Sam Neill , Irish @-@ born Pierce Brosnan and Welshman Timothy Dalton audition for the role in 1986 . Bond co @-@ producer Michael G. Wilson , director John Glen , Dana and Barbara Broccoli " were impressed with Sam Neill and very much wanted to use him . " However , Albert Broccoli was not sold on the actor . 
 The producers eventually offered the role to Brosnan after a three @-@ day screen @-@ test . At the time , he was contracted to the television show Remington Steele which had been cancelled by the NBC network due to falling ratings . The announcement that he would be chosen to play James Bond caused a surge in interest in the series , which led to NBC exercising ( less than three days prior to expiry ) a 60 @-@ day option in Brosnan 's contract to make a further season of the show . NBC 's action caused drastic repercussions , as a result of which Albert Broccoli withdrew the offer given to Brosnan , citing that he did not want the character associated with a contemporary TV series . This led to a drop in interest in Remington Steele , and only five new episodes were filmed before the show was finally cancelled . The edict from Broccoli was that " Remington Steele will not be James Bond . " 
 Dana Broccoli suggested Timothy Dalton . Albert Broccoli was initially reluctant given Dalton 's public lack of interest in the role , but at his wife 's urging agreed to meet the actor . However Dalton would soon begin filming Brenda Starr and so would be unavailable . In the intervening period , having completed Brenda Starr , Dalton was offered the role once again , which he accepted . For a period , the filmmakers had Dalton , but he had not signed a contract . A casting director persuaded Robert Bathurst , an English actor who would become known for his roles in Joking Apart , Cold Feet , and Downton Abbey to audition for Bond . Bathurst believes that his " ludicrous audition " was only " an arm @-@ twisting exercise " because the producers wanted to persuade Dalton to take the role by telling him they were still auditioning other actors . 
 The English actress Maryam d 'Abo , who was also a former model , was cast as the Czechoslovakian cellist Kara Milovy . In 1984 , d 'Abo had attended auditions for the role of Pola Ivanova in A View to a Kill . Barbara Broccoli included d 'Abo in the audition for playing Kara , which she later passed . 
 Originally , the KGB general set up by Koskov was to be General Gogol ; however , Walter Gotell was too sick to handle the major role , and the character of Leonid Pushkin replaced Gogol , who appears briefly at the end of the film , having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service . This was Gogol 's final appearance in a James Bond film . Morten Harket , the lead vocalist of the Norwegian rock group A @-@ ha ( which performed the film 's title song ) , was offered a small role as a villain 's henchman in the film , but declined , because of lack of time and because he felt they wanted to cast him due to his popularity rather than his acting . 
 Director John Glen decided to include the macaw from For Your Eyes Only . It can be seen squawking in the kitchen of Brayden House when Necros attacks MI6 's officers . 
 Other actors considered for the role of James Bond included Mel Gibson , Mark Greenstreet , Lambert Wilson , Antony Hamilton , Christopher Lambert , Finlay Light , and Andrew Clarke . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The film was shot at Pinewood Studios at its 007 Stage in the UK , as well as <unk> in Austria . The pre @-@ title sequence was filmed on the Rock of Gibraltar and although the sequence shows a hijacked Land Rover careering down various sections of road for several minutes before bursting through a wall towards the sea , the location mostly used the same short stretch of road at the very top of the Rock , shot from numerous different angles . The beach defences seen at the foot of the Rock in the initial shot were also added solely for the film , to an otherwise non @-@ military area . The action involving the Land Rover switched from Gibraltar to Beachy Head in the UK for the shot showing the vehicle actually getting airborne . Trial runs of the stunt with the Land Rover , during which Bond escapes by parachute from the tumbling vehicle , were filmed in the Mojave Desert , although the final cut of the film uses a shot achieved using a dummy . Other locations included Germany , the United States , and Italy , while the desert scenes were shot in Ouarzazate , Morocco . The conclusion of the film was shot at the Schönbrunn Palace , Vienna and <unk> Hall , Suffolk . 
 Principal photography commenced at Gibraltar on 17 September 1986 . Aerial stuntmen B. J. Worth and Jake Lombard performed the pre @-@ credits parachute jump . Both the terrain and wind were unfavourable . Consideration was given to the stunt being done using cranes but aerial stunts arranger B. J. Worth stuck to skydiving and completed the scenes in a day . The aircraft used for the jump was a C @-@ 130 Hercules , which in the film had M 's office installed in the aircraft cabin . The initial point of view for the scene shows M in what appears to be his usual London office , but the camera then zooms out to reveal that it is , in fact , inside an aircraft . Although marked as a Royal Air Force aircraft , the one in shot belonged to the Spanish Air Force and was used again later in the film for the Afghanistan sequences , this time in " Russian " markings . During this later chapter , a fight breaks out on the open ramp of the aircraft in flight between Bond and Necros , before Necros falls to his death . Although the plot and preceding shots suggest the aircraft is a C @-@ 130 , the shot of Necros falling away from the aircraft show a twin engine cargo plane , a C @-@ 123 Provider . Worth and Lombard also doubled for Bond and Necros in the scenes where they are hanging on a bag in a plane 's open cargo door . 
 The press would not meet Dalton and d 'Abo until 5 October 1986 , when the main unit travelled to Vienna . Almost two weeks after the second unit filming on Gibraltar , the first unit started shooting with Andreas Wisniewski and stunt man Bill Weston . During the course of the three days it took to film this fight , Weston fractured a finger and Wisniewski knocked him out once . The next day found the crew on location at Stonor House , doubling for Bladen 's Safe House , the first scene Jeroen Krabbé filmed . 
 = = = = The return of Aston Martin = = = = 
 The film reunites Bond with the car maker Aston Martin . Following Bond 's use of the Aston Martin DBS in On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , the filmmakers then turned to the brand new Lotus Esprit in 1977 's The Spy Who Loved Me , which reappeared four years later in For Your Eyes Only . Despite the iconic status of the submersible Lotus however , Bond 's Aston Martin DB5 is recognised as the most famous of his vehicles . As a consequence , Aston Martin returned with their V8 Vantage . 
 Two different Aston Martin models were used in filming — a V8 Volante convertible , and later for the Czechoslovakia scenes , a hard @-@ top non @-@ Volante V8 saloon badged to look like the Volante . The Volante was a production model owned by Aston Martin <unk> chairman , Victor Gauntlett . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The Living Daylights was the final Bond film to be scored by composer John Barry . The soundtrack is notable for its introduction of sequenced electronic rhythm tracks overdubbed with the orchestra — at the time , a relatively new innovation . 
 The title song of the film , " The Living Daylights " , was co @-@ written with Paul Waaktaar @-@ Savoy of the Norwegian pop @-@ music group A @-@ ha and recorded by the band . The group and Barry did not collaborate well , resulting in two versions of the theme song . Barry 's film mix is heard on the soundtrack ( and on A @-@ ha 's later greatest hits album Headlines and Deadlines ) . The version preferred by the band can be heard on the 1988 A @-@ ha album Stay on These Roads . However , in 2006 Paul Waaktaar @-@ Savoy complimented Barry 's contributions : " I loved the stuff he added to the track , I mean it gave it this really cool string arrangement . That 's when for me it started to sound like a Bond thing " . The title song is one of the few 007 title songs that is not performed or written by a British or American performer . 
 In a departure from previous Bond films , The Living Daylights was the first to use different songs over the opening and end credits . The song heard over the end credits , " If There Was a Man " , was one of two songs performed for the film by Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders . The other song , " Where Has Everybody Gone " , is heard from Necros 's Walkman in the film . The Pretenders were originally considered to perform Daylights ' title song . However , the producers had been pleased with the commercial success of Duran Duran 's " A View to a Kill " , and felt that A @-@ ha would be more likely to make an impact on the charts . 
 The original soundtrack release was released on LP and CD by Warner Bros. and featured only 12 tracks . Later re @-@ releases by Rykodisc and EMI added nine additional tracks , including alternate instrumental end credits music . Rykodisc 's version included the gunbarrel and opening sequence of the film as well as the jailbreak sequence , and the bombing of the bridge . 
 Additionally , the film featured a number of pieces of classical music , as the main Bond girl , Kara Milovy , is a cellist . Mozart 's 40th Symphony in G minor ( 1st movement ) is performed by the orchestra at the Conservatoire in Bratislava when Koskov flees . As Moneypenny tells Bond , Kara is next to perform Alexander Borodin 's String Quartet in D major , and the finale to Act II of Mozart 's The Marriage of Figaro ( in Vienna ) also features . Before Bond is drugged by Kara , Kara is practising the Cello solo from the first movement of Dvořák 's cello concerto in B minor . At the end of the film , Kara and an orchestra ( conducted onscreen by John Barry ) perform Tchaikovsky 's Rococo Variations to rapturous applause . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The Prince and Princess of Wales attended the film 's premiere on 27 June 1987 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London . The Living Daylights grossed the equivalent of $ 191 @.@ 2 million worldwide . In the United States it earned $ 51 @,@ 185 @,@ 000 , including an opening weekend of $ 11 @,@ 051 @,@ 284 , surpassing the $ 5 million grossed by The Lost Boys that was released on the same day . 
 In the film , Koskov and Whitaker repeatedly use vehicles and drug packets marked with the Red Cross . This action angered a number of Red Cross Societies , which sent letters of protest regarding the film . In addition , the British Red Cross attempted to prosecute the filmmakers and distributors . However , no legal action was taken . As a result , a disclaimer was added at the start of the film and some DVD releases . 
 The Living Daylights has a " Fresh " score of 70 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 50 reviews . IGN lauded the film for bringing back realism and espionage to the film series , and showing James Bond 's dark side . Many , including John J. Puccio and Chuck O 'Leary , praised Timothy Dalton 's performance and his performing most of the stunts himself . The Washington Post even said Dalton developed " the best Bond ever . " Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times criticised the lack of humour in the protagonist , however , while Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail wrote of Dalton 's Bond that " you get the feeling that on his off nights , he might curl up with the Reader 's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting " . 
 = Pavel Nedvěd = 
 Pavel Nedvěd ( Czech pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 30 August 1972 ) is a Czech retired footballer who played as a midfielder . Described as one of the best footballers of his generation , he is also regarded as one of the most successful players to emerge from the Czech Republic , winning domestic and European accolades with Italian clubs Lazio ( including the last Cup Winners ' Cup ) and Juventus ( whom he led to the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final ) . 
 Nedvěd was a key member of the Czech team which reached the final of Euro 1996 , during which he attracted international attention . He also captained the national team at Euro 2004 , where they were defeated in the semi @-@ final by eventual champions Greece , and Nedvěd was named as part of the Team of the Tournament . Furthermore , Nedvěd helped his team qualify for the World Cup for the first time since the breakup of Czechoslovakia . Due to his performances , as well as his quick and energetic runs during matches , Nedvěd was nicknamed Furia <unk> ( " Czech Fury " ) by Italian fans and The Czech cannon in English @-@ language media . 
 Winning the Ballon d 'Or as European Footballer of the Year in 2003 , Nedvěd was the second Czech player to receive the honour and the first since the breakup of Czechoslovakia . During his career Nedvěd received a number of other individual awards , including the second Golden Foot award in 2004 , Czech Footballer of the Year ( four times ) and the Golden Ball ( six times ) . He was also named by Pelé as one of the FIFA 100 , and was placed in the UEFA Team of the Year in 2003 , 2004 , and 2005 . He retired following the 2008 – 09 season , after a 19 @-@ year professional career . Nedvěd played 501 league matches at the club level ( scoring 110 goals ) , and was capped 91 times for the Czech Republic ( scoring 18 times ) .

 Born in <unk> and raised in nearby <unk> , Nedvěd began his football career in his native Czechoslovakia . A football fan from an early age , he began playing for his hometown club <unk> <unk> in 1977 at the age of five . Nedvěd moved on to <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1985 , playing one season before spending five years with Škoda Plzeň . In 1990 , Nedvěd was loaned to Dukla Prague , a club run by the Army , as part of his military service . During his first year at Dukla Prague , he played for <unk> Dukla <unk> , a lower division club also operated by the army . On 28 October 1991 , Nedvěd played his first match for Dukla Prague . He played one season for Dukla in 1991 before finishing his military service , thus ending his loan from Plzeň . He then transferred to Sparta Prague in 1992 . Plzeň was to receive 30 percent of the transfer fee should Nedvěd transfer to a foreign club . 
 Early in his career at Sparta , Nedvěd was sent off three times in just six matches . With Sparta , Nedvěd won one Czechoslovak First League title , two Gambrinus liga titles and a Czech Cup . In 1994 , he received his first call up to the Czech Republic national football team . His performance at Euro 1996 , including a goal in the group stage match against Italy , attracted attention ; despite a verbal agreement with PSV Eindhoven , Nedvěd moved from Sparta Prague to Italian Serie A team Lazio . Sparta first sold Nedvěd to Slovak club 1 . FC Košice ( which had the same owner as Sparta ) for a transfer fee of 1 @.@ 5 million CZK , and immediately , Košice sold Nedvěd to Lazio . Thus Sparta paid only a small fraction of the transfer fee to Plzeň . After Plzeň 's protest , Czech football association ordered Sparta to pay Plzeň 35 million CZK in compensation . 
 Nedvěd signed a four @-@ year contract for a fee of ₤ 1 @.@ 2 million . 
 = = = Lazio = = = 
 Nedvěd made his league debut for Lazio on 7 September 1996 in a 1 – 0 away defeat against Bologna . He scored his first league goal for the club against Cagliari on 20 October 1996 , finishing the 1996 – 97 season with seven goals . He became an integral part of the side , scoring four goals in three matches early in the 1997 – 98 season . The club had a 24 @-@ game unbeaten streak from November 1997 to April 1998 , ending with a league match against Juventus in which Nedvěd was sent off . That season , Lazio won the 1997 – 98 Coppa Italia and reached the final of the 1997 – 98 UEFA Cup . Nedvěd and Lazio began the 1998 – 99 season with a victory in the Supercoppa Italiana , Nedvěd scoring as the club defeated Juventus 2 – 1 . He played a role in Lazio 's road to the last @-@ ever Cup Winners ' Cup , scoring against Lausanne in the first round and in both legs of Lazio 's 7 – 0 aggregate quarter @-@ final victory over Panionios . In the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup Final , Nedvěd scored the decisive goal against Mallorca for Lazio 's 2 – 1 win . This proved to be the last goal of the tournament , which was later discontinued . 
 Nedvěd was one of the ten highest @-@ paid footballers in the Italian league in 1999 . He played in the 1999 UEFA Super Cup against Manchester United at the beginning of the season , where Lazio won the match by a single goal . The club went on to win the Serie A title and Coppa Italia , completing a domestic double in 2000 with Nedvěd 's help ; he won the Supercoppa Italiana with Lazio for a second time in 2000 . With Siniša <unk> , Nedvěd was one of two Lazio players sent off in the quarter @-@ final of the 2000 Coppa Italia held in December ; the defending champions lost 5 – 3 on aggregate to Udinese . Nedvěd played UEFA Champions League football with Lazio , scoring against Real Madrid in a 2 – 2 draw in the second group stage before the Italian side were eliminated . In Lazio 's final Champions League match of the season , Nedvěd was criticised by Leeds United manager David O 'Leary for a challenge on Alan Maybury ( although the referee did not call a foul ) and he received a three @-@ match suspension from European competition from UEFA . 
 Despite Nedvěd 's signing a new four @-@ year contract with Lazio in April 2001 , the club tried to sell him and teammate Juan Sebastián Verón that summer ; this triggered fan protests against club president Sergio <unk> . The players were ultimately sold to Juventus and Manchester United , respectively . 
 = = = Juventus = = = 
 After five seasons with Lazio , Nedvěd was speculatively linked to several clubs ( including Manchester United and Chelsea ) before moving to Juventus in 2001 for € 41 million . At Juventus he replaced Zinedine Zidane , who had transferred to Spain 's Real Madrid that summer . Nedvěd was a regular on Juventus ' 2001 – 02 and 2002 – 03 Scudetto @-@ winning teams . Although he was a substantial part of the club 's championship season in 2003 , he was also the subject of controversy . Nedvěd quit the Italian Footballers ' Association in protest of the union 's limit on non @-@ EU players ; his native Czech Republic did not become an EU member until 2004 . Although he was instrumental in leading Juventus to the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan , he had to sit out the final because of an accumulation of yellow cards after his semifinal booking for a foul on Real Madrid midfielder Steve McManaman . 
 In December 2003 , Nedvěd was named World Footballer of the Year by World Soccer . Later that month he won the European Footballer of the Year award over Thierry Henry and Paolo Maldini , the second Czech to win the award ( after Josef <unk> in 1962 ) . Nedvěd received further recognition in his home country when he won the 2004 Golden Ball , awarded by Czech sportswriters , for the fifth time in seven years . 
 The 2004 – 05 season was frustrating for the midfielder , who was sidelined for two months by knee and head injuries and first considered retirement in April 2005 . Although Juventus won Serie A titles that year and in 2006 , the titles were revoked after the Calciopoli match fixing scandal . After the 2005 – 06 season , which ended with Juventus ' relegation from Serie A despite its first @-@ place finish , many stars ( such as Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram ) left the club and the remaining players ' future was uncertain . After the World Cup Nedvěd dispelled rumours about his departure by reiterating his desire to help Juventus regain promotion to Serie A , citing his family and his commitment to the club as reasons for his decision . He received a five @-@ game ban after a red card against Genoa in December 2006 , and repeated his threat to retire . However , he remained with the club until the end of the season and scored 11 league goals in the 2006 – 07 Serie B. 
 For the 2007 – 08 season , Juventus again played in Serie A. Nedvěd played frequently for the <unk> , contributing as the team 's first @-@ choice left winger and scoring two goals that season . He was again controversial , with his November 2007 tackle of Internazionale midfielder Luís Figo breaking the Portuguese player 's fibula . In April 2008 , Nedvěd was hospitalised overnight for a concussion sustained in a collision with Roberto Guana during a match against Palermo . 
 Nedvěd scored Juventus ' first league goal of the 2008 – 09 season in a 1 – 1 away draw with Fiorentina , and scored twice against Bologna in a 2 – 1 away win in October . On 26 February 2009 , Nedvěd announced that he would retire at the end of 2008 – 09 season to spend more time with his family . On 10 March 2009 , Nedvěd was substituted due to injury after 12 minutes of the Champions League last @-@ 16 second leg match against Chelsea . Due to his impending retirement and his club 's 3 – 2 loss on aggregate , it was his last European game for Juventus . Nedvěd retired at the end of the season , captaining the final match against former team Lazio and setting up Vincenzo <unk> 's goal for a 2 – 0 victory .

 Nedvěd began playing for Czechoslovak national youth teams in 1988 , representing his country in the under @-@ 15 age group before progressing to 16 , 17 and 18 . In 1992 he made his first appearance on the under @-@ 21 team , playing seven times between 1992 and 1993 . 
 The midfielder debuted for the re @-@ formed Czech national team in June 1994 in a 3 – 1 win over the Republic of Ireland . His first major tournament was Euro 1996 , where he scored his first senior international goal and helped his team reach the final . He was also part of the Czech team that placed third in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup , defeating Uruguay in the third @-@ place match . Nedvěd scored two goals during the tournament , both which came during the Czech Republic 's 6 @-@ 1 win over the United Arab Emirates in their final group match , which allowed them to progress to the semi @-@ finals , where they were defeated by eventual champions Brazil . 
 = = = Euro 1996 = = = 
 The Czech Republic were not expected to make an impact against the favoured German side in their opening match ; Nedvěd missed two scoring chances and was one of ten players to receive a yellow card as Germany won 2 – 0 . He contributed defensively , however , clearing a goal @-@ bound shot from Christian <unk> off the line . 
 Nedvěd scored his first senior international goal in his nation 's Group C match against Italy , putting the Czech Republic in the lead 1 – 0 after four minutes . Although Italy scored an equaliser during the first half , they were reduced to ten men and the Czech Republic scored again before halftime for a 2 – 1 win . Nedvěd played in the third group match , against Russia , getting his second yellow card of the tournament as the Czechs tied 3 – 3 to advance to the knockout stage . 
 Due to a suspension , Nedvěd missed the Czech Republic 's quarter @-@ final game against Portugal ; however , the Czechs won in his absence and progressed . In the semifinal match against France , Nedvěd was named man of the match as the Czech Republic advanced to the final after a penalty shoot – out when he scored his team 's second penalty shot . He and the Czech Republic team lost 2 – 1 in the final to Germany , who scored a golden goal . 
 = = = Euro 2000 = = = 
 Before Euro 2000 , Nedvěd was unable to train normally due to an ankle injury . The Czechs ' first match ( against the Netherlands ) saw him and international teammate Jan Koller hit the woodwork without scoring , before the Dutch scored a controversial penalty to win 1 – 0 . In the second match , against France , he was fouled ; the resultant Czech penalty was converted by Karel Poborský to even the score 1 – 1 . Despite two shots on goal , Nedvěd could not beat French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and France won the match 2 – 1 . He played in the third group match , against Denmark ; despite the Czechs ' 2 – 0 victory , the team was eliminated from the tournament . After Euro 2000 , Nedvěd took over the national team captaincy from Jiří <unk> .

 Nedvěd was instrumental in the Euro 2004 group stage match against the Netherlands . Two goals down after 19 minutes , he gave a man of the match performance as the Czechs rebounded to win 3 – 2 . Nine players ( including Nedvěd ) were rested for the group match against Germany , with the Czechs already qualified for the knockout stage . He received a yellow card , upheld on appeal , in the quarter @-@ final match against Denmark ; this meant that Nedvěd would miss the final if he received another yellow card in the semifinal against Greece . However , Greece defeated the Czech Republic and Nedvěd was substituted after a knee injury . After their exit from the tournament , Nedvěd announced his retirement from the national team ; he was named to the Team of the Tournament with countrymen Petr Čech and Milan Baroš . 
 = = = 2006 World Cup = = = 
 The midfielder was persuaded by coach Karel Brückner and his teammates to come out of international retirement in time for the World Cup qualification playoffs against Norway , in which the Czech Republic qualified for the final tournament for the first time since the breakup of Czechoslovakia . Although Nedvěd 's World Cup participation was jeopardised by a June knee injury , he was able to play . 
 The Czechs won the first match of the 2006 FIFA World Cup with 3 – 0 against the United States , but key players were injured ; they lost their next two group matches against Ghana and eventual winners Italy , finishing third in their group . Nedvěd 's apparent goal at the beginning of the second half in the match against Ghana was ruled offside . His shots on goal against Italy were saved by Juventus teammate Gianluigi Buffon . Nedvěd again announced his retirement from the international scene before the August 2006 friendly match against Serbia and Montenegro , in which he made his 91st ( and final ) appearance . He refused to reverse his decision before Euro 2008 , despite requests from teammates and Brückner . In the 91 appearances he made for his national side , Nedvěd scored 18 goals . 
 = = Style of play = =

 The PS Washington Irving was a 4 @,@ 000 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 3 @,@ 600 t ) sidewheel day boat and the flagship of the Hudson River Day Line that operated on the Hudson River from 1913 to 1926 . 
 The Washington Irving collided with an oil barge in the fog on 1 June 1926 on the North River . With the aid of tugboats , it reached shore at Pier 12 , Jersey City , where it sank soon thereafter . Out of 200 passengers and 105 crew , three died as a result of the accident . 
 Its removal was complicated due to its sinking upon the site of the Holland Tunnel , which was under construction . It remained submerged there until 13 February 1927 , when it was raised and determined to be a total loss . A bond was issued for its replacement . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The quadruple @-@ decker Washington Irving , named after the author Washington Irving , was built in 1912 by the New York Shipbuilding Company for contract number 126 with machinery built by W. & A. Fletcher Company of Hoboken , New Jersey . The ship was launched 7 December 1912 and delivered 3 May 1913 for use in the New York City @-@ Albany service . 
 Naval architect Frank E. Kirby , designer of large Great Lakes passenger steamers , collaborated with the New York City firm J. W. Millard & Brothers , designers of ferry boats , to design the ship . Kirby 's <unk> , launched 9 November 1912 at the Detroit Shipbuilding Company , was the largest side wheel ship in the world at the time . Preliminary design tests on hull form were conducted by at the University of Michigan determining the best form for minimum wave making resistance in shallow water at high speeds . With a carrying capacity of 6 @,@ 000 passengers , it had the largest passenger @-@ carrying capacity of any riverboat built at the time of its construction . 
 The steel hulled steamer measured 416 feet 6 inches ( 126 @.@ 9 m ) length overall , 86 feet 6 inches ( 26 @.@ 4 m ) beam over all , 44 feet ( 13 @.@ 4 m ) molded beam , 14 feet 2 inches ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) depth and 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) draft . The ship 's tonnage was 4 @,@ 000 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 3 @,@ 600 t ) . Seven transverse bulkheads divided the hull with extensive strengthening for rigidity of the five decks to prevent hogging and sagging without use of visible hogging girders prevalent on older vessels of the type . Steel and asbestos were used in hull and superstructure , particularly in high exposure areas such as fire room and galley , whenever practical for fire protection . 
 Propulsion was by steel , <unk> paddles 24 feet 6 inches ( 7 @.@ 5 m ) in diameter 6 @,@ 000 horsepower ( 4 @,@ 500 kW ) driven by a three @-@ cylinder compound inclined engine with cylinders measuring 45 inches ( 110 cm ) , 70 inches ( 180 cm ) and 70 inches ( 180 cm ) with an 84 inches ( 210 cm ) stroke . Four single ended and two double ended Scotch boilers provided steam . The single ended boilers measured 12 feet 4 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) diameter by 11 feet 11 inches ( 3 @.@ 6 m ) length and the double ended boilers were 12 feet 4 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) diameter by 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) in length with coal consumption of five tons per <unk> operating speed was 23 @.@ 5 miles per hour ( 37 @.@ 8 km / h ) or , in marine terms , 20 @.@ 4 knots . Two 35 kilowatt Kerr turbo generators provided electrical power . 
 The ship had three smoke stacks amidships for its boilers , but the forward stack was non @-@ functioning ; only added for aesthetic purposes . The ship began service with the Hudson River Day Line as their flagship steamer from 1913 to 1926 . 
 Washington Irving was intended solely for passenger day service and neither sleeping nor cargo spaces were incorporated in design . Nineteen private " balcony parlors " were available with the rest of the spaces being large public spaces with decor based on the Irving period . A large writing room 's design was based on the Alhambra . Forward , below the main deck , was a large lunch room <unk> on the Old Cock Tavern of London and a ladies lounge was patterned on Irving 's study at " Sunnyside " . The main dining room , on the after main deck , was purely in Colonial style . The main saloon on the main deck blended Moorish and Knickerbocker designs and was among the largest rooms afloat . The vessel had about 2 acres ( 0 @.@ 8 ha ) of outside deck space and rooms were fitted with large plate glass for views of the river . Though licensed for 6 @,@ 000 passengers , breaking a record for such ships previously held by consort Hendrik Hudson , the deck space would have made it possible to carry 1 @,@ 400 more than its 6 @,@ 000 capacity license allowed .

 The Washington Irving operated daily leisure passenger service up and down the Hudson River . Its maiden voyage was on Saturday , 17 May 1913 from the <unk> Street Pier in New York City with a destination of Albany . On that voyage , fifty oil paintings by artists illustrating the Irving period were on view . Tickets for the maiden voyage sold for $ 1 @.@ 00 . 
 Washington Irving replaced the Robert Fulton on the New York to Albany run . The ship remained in service up until its sinking in 1926 and was the only ship in service ever to be lost by the Day Line . The first pilot of the Washington Irving from 1913 through 1923 was Captain Van <unk> .

 Soon after departing the <unk> Street Pier on its way to Albany in the morning fog of 1 June 1926 , Washington Irving was struck , a little after 9 : 00am , by one of two oil barges being pushed by the tug boat Thomas E. Moran . The collision damaged Washington Irving 's starboard side below the water line just aft of amidships , allowing water to rush into the engine rooms . The collision resulted in a hole measuring 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) long and 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) wide . The Captain , David H. Deming , ordered all passengers to put on life preservers and whistled the " Ship 's afire " signal of two long and three short blasts repeatedly . A chaos of shouts prevailed as the passengers tried to don life vests and locate their children in the fog . An inability to see any land increased the alarm of the passengers despite the Captain 's shouts that all would be safe and he ordered the jazz band to resume playing their music and maintain their post until rescue . 
 Assisted by tug boats , Washington Irving reached shore at the then under construction Pier 12 , Jersey City and sank five minutes later . Three passengers died as a result of the accident . <unk> Wood Hoag , ( wife of Lynne Arthur Hoag and mother to Arthur Allen Hoag ) , their three @-@ year @-@ old daughter Mary , and B. Woods , a steward , who was trapped in a cabin far below deck . The accident was determined to be unavoidable due to " the unusual and unexpected strength of the tidal current , possibly below the surface " after an inquiry by the United States Steamship Inspection Board closed on 9 June 1926 . 
 Washington Irving was valued at $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 but insured for much less . The barge suffered only $ 8 @,@ 000 of damages . At the time of the sinking , Alexander McKinney was the head porter . He had joined the Day Line in 1905 and continued in their service till at least 1964 .

In March , Washington Irving was determined to be a total loss and a bond was issued to refinance the company 's debt and to provide financing for its replacement , the Peter Stuyvesant . The Peter Stuyvesant was originally estimated to cost $ 700 @,@ 000 , but when the boat was completed in June , the final cost was closer to $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . 
 = Henry Wood = 
 Sir Henry Joseph Wood CH ( 3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944 ) was an English conductor best known for his association with London 's annual series of promenade concerts , known as the Proms . He conducted them for nearly half a century , introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences . After his death , the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the " Henry Wood Promenade Concerts " , although they continued to be generally referred to as " the Proms " . 
 Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent , Wood started his career as an organist . During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music , he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist . After similar work for Richard D 'Oyly Carte 's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others , Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company . He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company . One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky 's Eugene Onegin in 1892 . 
 From the mid @-@ 1890s until his death , Wood focused on concert conducting . He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen 's Hall , offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices . The series was successful , and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944 . By the 1920s , Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music . When the Queen 's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941 , the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall . 
 Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras , believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom . In addition to the Proms , he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music . He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career : he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music , and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and nurtured the taste of the public , presenting a vast repertoire of music spanning four centuries . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Wood was born in Oxford Street , London , the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha , née Morris . Wood senior had started in his family 's pawnbroking business , but by the time of his son 's birth he was trading as a jeweller , optician and engineering modeller , much sought @-@ after for his model engines . It was a musical household : Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre @-@ without @-@ Newgate , known as " the musicians ' church " . His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales . They encouraged their son 's interest in music , buying him a Broadwood piano , on which his mother gave him lessons . The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola . 
 Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre , but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist , George Cooper , who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument . Cooper died when Wood was seven , and the boy took further lessons from Cooper 's successor , Edwin M. Lott , for whom Wood had much less regard . At the age of ten , through the influence of one of his uncles , Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury , being paid half a crown . In June 1883 , visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father , Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries , making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months . At this time in his life , painting was nearly as strong an interest as music , and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art . He remained a life @-@ long amateur painter . 
 After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout , Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen , studying harmony and composition with Prout , organ with Charles Steggall , and piano with Walter Macfarren . It is not clear whether he was a member of Manuel Garcia 's singing class , but it is certain that he became its accompanist and was greatly influenced by Garcia . Wood also accompanied the opera class , taught by Garcia 's son Gustave . Wood 's ambition at the time was to become a teacher of singing , and he gave singing lessons throughout his life . He attended the classes of as many singing teachers as he could , although by his own account , " I possess a terrible voice . Garcia said it would go through a brick wall . In fact , a real conductor 's voice . " 
 = = = Opera = = = 
 On leaving the Royal Academy of Music in 1888 , Wood taught singing privately and was soon very successful , attracting " more singing pupils than I could comfortably deal with " at half a guinea an hour . He also worked as a répétiteur . According to his memoirs , he worked in that capacity for Richard D 'Oyly Carte during the rehearsals for the first production of The Yeomen of the Guard at the Savoy Theatre in 1888 . His biographer Arthur Jacobs doubts this and discounts exchanges Wood purported to have had with Sir Arthur Sullivan about the score . Jacobs describes Wood 's memoirs as " vivacious in style but factually unreliable " . 
 It is certain , however , that Wood was répétiteur at Carte 's Royal English Opera House for Sullivan 's grand opera Ivanhoe in late 1890 and early 1891 , and for André Messager 's La Basoche in 1891 – 92 . He also worked for Carte at the Savoy as assistant to François Cellier on The Nautch Girl in 1891 . Wood remained devoted to Sullivan 's music and later insisted on programming his concert works when they were out of fashion in musical circles . During this period , he had several compositions of his own performed , including an oratorio , St. Dorothea ( 1889 ) , a light opera , Daisy ( 1890 ) , and a one @-@ act comic opera , Returning the <unk> ( 1890 ) . 
 Wood recalled that his first professional appearance as a conductor was at a choral concert in December 1887 . Ad hoc engagements of this kind were commonplace for organists , but they brought little prestige such as was given to British conductor @-@ composers such as Sullivan , Charles Villiers Stanford and Alexander Mackenzie , or the rising generation of German star conductors led by Hans Richter and Arthur Nikisch . His first sustained work as a conductor was his 1889 appointment as musical director of a small touring opera ensemble , the Arthur <unk> English Touring Opera . The company was not of a high standard , with an orchestra of only six players augmented by local recruits at each tour venue . Wood eventually negotiated a release from his contract , and after a brief return to teaching he secured a better appointment as conductor for the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1891 . For that company he conducted Carmen , The Bohemian Girl , The Daughter of the Regiment , Maritana , and Il trovatore . This appointment was followed by a similar engagement with a company set up by former Carl Rosa singers . 
 When Signor Lago , formerly impresario of the Imperial Opera Company of St. Petersburg , was looking for a second conductor to work with Luigi Arditi for a proposed London season , Garcia recommended Wood . The season opened at the newly rebuilt Olympic Theatre in London , in October 1892 , with Wood conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky 's Eugene Onegin . At that time the operatic conductor was not seen as an important figure , but the critics who chose to mention the conducting gave Wood good reviews . The work was not popular with the public , and the season was cut short when Lago absconded , leaving the company unpaid . Before that debacle , Wood had also conducted performances of Maritana and rehearsed Oberon and Der Freischütz . After the collapse of the Olympic opera season , Wood returned once more to his singing tuition . With the exception of a season at the Opera Comique in 1896 , Wood 's subsequent conducting career was in the concert hall . 
 = = = Early years of the Proms = = = 
 In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl , who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen 's Hall in London . The manager of the hall , Robert Newman , was proposing to run a ten @-@ week season of promenade concerts and , impressed by Wood , invited him to conduct . There had been such concerts in London since 1838 , under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan . Sullivan 's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful , because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music . He introduced major classical works , such as Beethoven symphonies , normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others . Newman aimed to do the same : " I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages . Popular at first , gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music . " 
 Newman 's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts , which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971 . <unk> were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts , not only during intervals . Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts : the promenade ( the standing area ) was one shilling , the balcony two shillings , and the grand circle ( reserved seats ) three and five shillings . 
 Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season . Dr George Cathcart , a wealthy ear , nose and throat specialist , offered to sponsor it on two conditions : that Wood should conduct every concert , and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal . Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent , and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers ' voices . Wood , from his experience as a singing teacher , agreed . As members of Wood 's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low @-@ pitched instruments , Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players . After a season , the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted , and they bought the instruments from him . 
 On 10 August 1895 , the first of the Queen 's Hall Promenade Concerts took place . Among those present who later recalled the opening was the singer Agnes Nicholls : 
 Just before 8 o 'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his position behind the curtain at the end of the platform – watch in hand . <unk> , on the stroke of eight , he walked quickly to the rostrum , buttonhole and all , and began the National Anthem ... A few moments for the audience to settle down , then the Rienzi Overture , and the first concert of the new <unk> had begun . 
 The rest of the programme comprised , in the words of an historian of the Proms , David Cox , " for the most part ... blatant trivialities . " Within days , however , Wood was shifting the balance from light music to mainstream classical works , with Schubert 's Unfinished Symphony and further excerpts from Wagner operas . Among the other symphonies Wood conducted during the first season were Schubert 's Great C Major , Mendelssohn 's Italian and Schumann 's Fourth . The concertos included Mendelssohn 's Violin Concerto and Schumann 's Piano Concerto . During the season Wood presented 23 novelties , including the London premieres of pieces by Richard Strauss , Tchaikovsky , Glazunov , Massenet and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov . Newman and Wood soon felt able to devote every Monday night of the season principally to Wagner and every Friday night to Beethoven , a pattern that endured for decades . 
 The income from the concerts did not permit generous rehearsal time . Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week 's six concerts . To gain the best results on so little rehearsal , Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career . First , he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players ; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique . An orchestral cellist wrote that " if you watched him , you couldn 't come in wrong . " The violist Bernard Shore wrote , " You may be reading at sight in public , but you can 't possibly go wrong with that stick in front of you " . Thirty @-@ five years after Wood 's death , André Previn recounted a story by one of his players who recalled that Wood " had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10 a.m. precisely his baton went down . You learned things so thoroughly with him , but in the most economical time . " 
 Another feature of Wood 's conducting was his insistence on accurate tuning ; before each rehearsal and concert he would check the instrument of each member of the woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork . He persisted in this practice until 1937 , when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary . To improve ensemble , Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra . His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left , with the cellos to his right , a layout that has since become common . 
 Between the first and second season of promenade concerts , Wood did his last work in the opera house , conducting Stanford 's new opera Shamus O 'Brien at the Opera Comique . It ran from March until July 1896 , leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen 's Hall season , which began at the end of August . The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts , but despite being popular they were not a financial success , and were not repeated in later years . In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen 's Hall 's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts . He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities , and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music . Sullivan wrote to him in 1898 , " I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday " . Seventy @-@ five years later , Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience . Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner . When Wood and the Queen 's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898 , Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme . Wood , who modelled his appearance on Nikisch , took it as a compliment that the queen said to him , " Tell me , Mr Wood , are you quite English ? " 
 In 1898 , Wood married one of his singing pupils , Olga <unk> , a divorcée a few months his senior . Jacobs describes it as " a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony " . As a singer , with Wood as her accompanist , she won praise from the critics .

 The promenade concerts flourished through the 1890s , but in 1902 Newman , who had been investing unwisely in theatrical presentations , found himself unable to bear the financial responsibility for the Queen 's Hall Orchestra and was declared bankrupt . The concerts were rescued by the musical benefactor Sir Edgar Speyer , a banker of German origin . Speyer put up the necessary funds , retained Newman as manager of the concerts , and encouraged him and Wood to continue with their project of improving the public 's taste . At the beginning of 1902 , Wood accepted the conductorship of that year 's Sheffield triennial festival . He continued to be associated with that festival until 1936 , changing its emphasis from choral to orchestral pieces . A German critic , reviewing the festival for a Berlin publication , wrote , " Two personalities now represent a new epoch in English musical life – Edward Elgar as composer , and Henry J. Wood as conductor . " Later in the year , overtaxed by his enormous workload , Wood 's health broke down . Even though this was during the Proms season , Cathcart insisted that Wood should have a complete break and change of scene . Leaving the leader of the orchestra , Arthur Payne , to conduct during his absence , Wood and his wife took a cruise to Morocco , missing the Proms concerts from 13 October to 8 November . 
 In the early years of the Proms there were complaints in some musical journals that Wood was neglecting British music . In 1899 Newman unsuccessfully attempted to secure for Wood the premiere of Elgar 's Enigma Variations , but in the same year Newman passed up the opportunity to introduce the music of Delius to London concertgoers . By the end of the first decade of the new century , however , Wood 's reputation in conducting British music was in no doubt ; he gave the world , British or London premieres of more than a hundred British works between 1900 and 1910 . Meanwhile , he introduced his audiences to many European composers . In the 1903 season , he programmed symphonies by Bruckner ( No. 7 ) , Sibelius ( No. 1 ) , and Mahler ( No. 1 ) . In the same year , he introduced several of Richard Strauss 's tone poems to London , and in 1905 he gave Strauss 's Symphonia Domestica . This prompted the composer to write , " I cannot leave London without an expression of admiration for the splendid Orchestra which Henry Wood 's master hand has created in such a short time . " 
 Creating the orchestra admired by Strauss had not been achieved without a struggle . In 1904 , Wood and Newman tackled the deputy system , in which orchestral players , if offered a better @-@ paid engagement , could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert . The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus : " A , whom you want , signs to play at your concert . He sends B ( whom you don 't mind ) to the first rehearsal . B , without your knowledge or consent , sends C to the second rehearsal . Not being able to play at the concert , C sends D , whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away . " After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra , Newman came on the platform to announce : " Gentlemen , in future there will be no deputies ; good morning . " Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra : the London Symphony Orchestra . Wood bore no grudge and attended their first concert , although it was 12 years before he agreed to conduct the orchestra . 
 Wood had great sympathy for rank @-@ and @-@ file orchestral players and strove for improvements in their pay . He sought to raise their status and was the first British conductor to insist that the orchestra should stand to acknowledge applause along with the conductor . He introduced women into the Queen 's Hall Orchestra in 1913 . He said , " I do not like ladies playing the trombone or double bass , but they can play the violin , and they do . " By 1918 Wood had 14 women in his orchestra . 
 Wood conducted his own compositions and arrangements from time to time . He gave his Fantasia on Welsh Melodies and Fantasia on Scottish Melodies on successive nights in 1909 . He composed the work for which he is most celebrated , Fantasia on British Sea Songs , for a concert in 1905 , celebrating the centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar . It caught the public fancy immediately , with its mixture of sea @-@ shanties , together with Handel 's " See the Conquering Hero Comes " and Arne 's " Rule , Britannia ! " . He played it at the Proms more than 40 times , and it became a fixture at the " Last Night of the Proms " , the lively concert marking the end of each season . It remained so under his successors , though often rearranged , notably by Sir Malcolm Sargent . A highlight of the Fantasia is the hornpipe ( " Jack 's the Lad " ) ; Wood said of it : 
 They stamp their feet in time to the hornpipe – that is until I whip up the orchestra to a fierce accelerando which leaves behind all those whose stamping technique is not of the very finest quality . I like to win by two bars , if possible ; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half . It is good fun , and I enjoy it as much as they . 
 Among Wood 's other works was his Purcell Suite , incorporating themes from Purcell 's stage works and string sonatas , which Wood performed at an orchestral festival in Zurich in 1921 , and orchestral transcriptions of works by a range of composers from Albéniz to Vivaldi . 
 Wood worked with his wife for many concerts , and was her piano accompanist at her recitals . In 1906 , at the Norwich music festival he presented Beethoven 's Choral Symphony and Bach 's St Matthew Passion , with his wife among the singers . In December 1909 , after a short illness , Olga Wood died . Cathcart took Wood away to take his mind off his loss . On his return , Wood resumed his professional routine , with the exception that , after Olga 's death , he rarely performed as piano accompanist for anyone else ; his skill in that art was greatly missed by the critics . In June 1911 , he married his secretary , Muriel Ellen Greatrex ( 1882 – 1967 ) , with whom he had two daughters . In the same year he accepted a knighthood , and declined the conductorship of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in succession to Mahler , as he felt it his duty to devote himself to the British public . 
 Throughout the early part of the century , Wood was influential in changing the habits of concertgoers . Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section . Wood discouraged this , sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed in programmes . For this he was much praised in the musical and national press . In addition to his work at the Queen 's Hall , Wood conducted at the Sheffield , Norwich , Birmingham , Wolverhampton , and Westmorland festivals , and at orchestral concerts in Cardiff , Manchester , Liverpool , Leicester and Hull . His programming was summarised in The Manchester Guardian , which listed the number of each composer 's works played in the 1911 Proms season ; the top ten were : Wagner ( 121 ) ; Beethoven ( 34 ) ; Tchaikovsky ( 30 ) ; Mozart ( 28 ) ; Dvořák ( 16 ) ; Weber ( 16 ) ; J.S. Bach ( 14 ) ; Brahms ( 14 ) ; Elgar ( 14 ) ; and Liszt ( 13 ) . 
 The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are singled out by Cox as among the finest of this part of Wood 's career . Among those conducting their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss , Debussy , Reger , Scriabin , and Rachmaninoff . Schoenberg 's Five Pieces for Orchestra also received its first performance ( the composer not being present ) ; during rehearsals , Wood urged his players , " Stick to it , gentlemen ! This is nothing to what you 'll have to play in 25 years ' time " . The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance : " It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like , but a good third of the people at Queen 's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg . Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing , and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss ; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London . " However , when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work 's second British performance , on 17 January 1914 , the composer was so delighted with the result , more warmly received than had been the premiere , that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly : " I must say it was the first time since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands . " 
 = = = First World War and post @-@ war = = = 
 On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , Newman , Wood and Speyer discussed whether the Proms should continue as planned . They had by this time become an established institution , and it was agreed to go ahead . However , anti @-@ German feeling forced Speyer to leave the country and seek refuge in the US , and there was a campaign to ban all German music from concerts . Newman put out a statement declaring that German music would be played as planned : " The greatest examples of Music and Art are world possessions and unassailable even by the prejudices and passions of the hour . " When Speyer left Britain , the music publishers Chappell 's took on the responsibility for the Queen 's Hall and its orchestra . The Proms continued throughout the war years , with fewer major new works than before , although there were nevertheless British premieres of pieces by Bartók , Stravinsky and Debussy . An historian of the Proms , <unk> Orga , wrote , " Concerts often had to be re @-@ timed to coincide with the ' All Clear ' between air raids . Falling bombs , shrapnel , anti @-@ aircraft fire and the droning of Zeppelins were ever threatening . But [ Wood ] kept things on the go and in the end had a very real part to play in boosting morale . " 
 Towards the end of the war , Wood received an offer by which he was seriously tempted : the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical director . He had been guest conductor of the Berlin and New York Philharmonic Orchestras , but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest in the world . Nonetheless , as he told Boult , " it was hard to refuse , but I felt it was a patriotic duty to remain in my own country , at the present moment . " 
 After the war , the Proms continued much as before . The second halves of concerts still featured piano @-@ accompanied songs rather than serious classical music . Chappell 's , having taken over sponsorship of the Proms and spent £ 35 @,@ 000 keeping the Queen 's Hall going during the war , wished to promote songs published by the company . The management of Chappell 's were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works , most of which were not profitable . 
 In 1921 Wood was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society , the first English conductor to receive the honour . By now he was beginning to find his position as Britain 's leading conductor under challenge from rising younger rivals . Thomas Beecham had been an increasingly influential figure since about 1910 . He and Wood did not like one another , and each avoided mention of the other in his memoirs . Adrian Boult , who , at Wood 's recommendation , took over some of his responsibilities at Birmingham in 1923 , always admired and respected Wood . Other younger conductors included men who had been members of Wood 's orchestra , including Basil Cameron and Eugene Goossens . Another protégé of Wood was Malcolm Sargent , who appeared at the Proms as a composer @-@ conductor in 1921 and 1922 . Wood encouraged him to abandon thoughts of a career as a pianist and to concentrate on conducting . Wood further showed his interest in the future of music by taking on the conductorship of the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music in 1923 , rehearsing it twice a week , whenever possible , for the next twenty years . In the same year , he accepted the conductorship of the amateur Hull Philharmonic Orchestra , travelling three times a year until 1939 to rehearse and conduct its concerts . 
 In 1925 Wood was invited to conduct four concerts for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl . Such was their success , both artistic and financial , that Wood was invited back , and conducted again the following year . In addition to a large number of English pieces , Wood programmed works by composers as diverse as Bach and Stravinsky . He again conducted there in 1934 . 
 = = = BBC and the Proms = = = 
 On his return to England from his first Hollywood trip , Wood found himself in the middle of a feud between the chairman of Chappell 's , William Boosey , and the BBC . Boosey had conceived a passionate hostility to the broadcasting of music , fearing that it would lead to the end of live concerts . He attempted to prevent anyone who wished to perform at the Queen 's Hall from broadcasting for the BBC . This affected many of the artists whom Wood and Newman needed for the Proms . The matter was unresolved when Newman died in 1926 . Shortly afterwards , Boosey announced that Chappell 's would no longer support concerts at the Queen 's Hall . The prospect that the Proms might not be able to continue caused widespread dismay , and there was a general welcome for the BBC 's announcement that it would take over the running of the Proms , and would also run a winter series of symphony concerts at the Queen 's Hall . 
 The BBC regime brought immediate benefits . The use of the second half of concerts to promote Chappell 's songs ceased , to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence : on the first night under the BBC 's control , the songs in the second half were by Schubert , Quilter and Parry rather than ballads from Chappell 's . For Wood , the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed . He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed . He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them , instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available . 
 In 1929 , Wood played a celebrated practical joke on musicologists and critics . " I got very fed up with them , always finding fault with any arrangement or orchestrations that I made ... ' spoiling the original ' etc. etc . " , and so Wood passed off his own orchestration of Bach 's Toccata and Fugue in D minor , as a transcription by a Russian composer called Paul Klenovsky . In Wood 's later account , the press and the BBC " fell into the trap and said the scoring was wonderful , Klenovsky had the real flare [ sic ] for true colour etc . – and performance after performance was given and asked for . " Wood kept the secret for five years before revealing the truth . The press treated the deception as a great joke ; The Times entered into the spirit of it with a jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky . 
 As Wood 's working life took a turn for the better , his domestic life started to deteriorate . During the early 1930s , he and his wife gradually became estranged , and their relationship ended in bitterness , with Muriel taking most of Wood 's money and , for much of the time , living abroad . She refused to divorce him . The breach between Muriel and Wood also caused his estrangement from their daughters . In 1934 he began a happy relationship with a widowed former pupil , Jessie Linton , who had sung for him frequently in the past under her professional name of Jessie <unk> . One of Wood 's players recalled , " She changed him . He had been badly dressed , awful clothes . Jessie got him a new evening suit , instead of the mouldy green one , and he flourished yellow gloves and a cigar ... he became human . " As Wood was not free to remarry , she changed her name by deed poll to " Lady Jessie Wood " and was generally assumed by the public to be Wood 's wife . In his memoirs , Wood mentioned neither his second marriage nor his subsequent relationship . 
 In his later years , Wood came to be identified with the Proms rather than with the year @-@ round concert season . Boult was appointed director of music at the BBC in 1930 . In that capacity he strove to ensure that Wood was invited to conduct a fitting number of BBC symphony concerts outside the Prom season . The BBC chose Wood for important collaborations with Bartók and Paul Hindemith , and for the first British performance of Mahler 's vast Symphony No. 8 . But Jacobs notes that , in the general concert repertory , Wood now had to compete against well @-@ known foreign conductors such as Bruno Walter , Willem Mengelberg , and Arturo Toscanini , " in comparison with whom he was increasingly seen as a workhorse " . 
 = = = Last years = = = 
 In 1936 , Wood was in charge of his final Sheffield festival . The choral works he conducted included the Verdi Requiem , Beethoven 's Missa Solemnis , Berlioz ' Te Deum , Walton 's Belshazzar 's Feast , and , in the presence of the composer , Rachmaninoff 's The Bells . The following year , Wood began planning for a grand concert to mark his fiftieth year as a conductor . The Royal Albert Hall was chosen as the venue , having a far larger capacity than the Queen 's Hall . The concert was given on 5 October 1938 . Rachmaninoff played the solo part in his Second Piano Concerto , and Vaughan Williams , at Wood 's request , composed a short choral work for the occasion : the Serenade to Music for orchestra and 16 soloists . The other composers represented in the programme were Sullivan , Beethoven , Bach , Bax , Wagner , Handel and Elgar . The orchestra comprised players from the three London orchestras : the London Symphony , London Philharmonic and BBC Symphony Orchestras . The concert raised £ 9 @,@ 000 for Wood 's chosen charity , providing health care for musicians . In the same year , Wood published his autobiography , My Life of Music . 
 In September 1939 , the Second World War broke out and the BBC immediately put into effect its contingency plans to move much of its broadcasting away from London to places thought less susceptible to bombing . Its musical activities , including the orchestra , moved to Bristol . The BBC withdrew not only the players , but financial support from the Proms . Wood determined that the 1940 season would nevertheless go ahead . The Royal Philharmonic Society and a private entrepreneur , Keith Douglas , agreed to back an eight @-@ week season , and the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged . The season was curtailed after four weeks , when intense bombing forced the Queen 's Hall to close . The last Prom given at the Queen 's Hall was on 7 September 1940 . In May 1941 , the hall was destroyed by bombs . 
 It was immediately agreed that the 1941 season of Proms should be held at the Albert Hall . It was twice the size of the Queen 's Hall , with poor acoustics , but a six @-@ week series was judged a success , and the Albert Hall remained the home of the Proms . Wood , aged seventy @-@ two , was persuaded to have an associate conductor to relieve him of some of the burden . Basil Cameron undertook the task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement , aged eighty , in 1964 . The BBC brought its symphony orchestra back to London and resumed its backing of the Proms in 1942 ; Boult joined Cameron as Wood 's associate conductor during that season . In early 1943 , Wood 's health deteriorated , and two days after the start of that year 's season , he collapsed and was ordered to have a month in bed . Despite wartime vicissitudes , the 1943 season sold nearly 250 @,@ 000 tickets , with an average audience of about 4 @,@ 000 – many more than could have fitted into the Queen 's Hall . 
 Despite his age and the difficulties of wartime travel , Wood insisted on going to provincial cities to conduct – as much , according to Jacobs , to help the local orchestras survive as to gratify audiences . His final season was in 1944 . The season began well with Wood in good form , but after three weeks raids by the devastating new German flying bombs caused the government to order the closure of places of entertainment . The Proms were immediately relocated to Bedford some 50 miles ( 80 km ) away , where Wood continued to conduct . He was taken ill in early August and was unable to conduct the fiftieth anniversary Prom on 10 August ; he was forbidden by his doctor even to listen to its broadcast . Wood died just over a week later on 19 August at Hitchin Hospital in Hitchin , Hertfordshire ; his funeral service was held in the town at St Mary 's church , and his ashes were interred in the Musicians ' Chapel of St Sepulchre @-@ without @-@ Newgate . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 Wood 's recording career began in 1908 , when he accompanied his wife Olga in " Farewell , forests " by Tchaikovsky , for the Gramophone and Typewriter Company , better known as His Master 's Voice or HMV . They made eight other records together for HMV over the next two years . After Olga 's death , Wood signed a contract with HMV 's rival , Columbia , for whom he made a series of discs between 1915 and 1917 with the singer Clara Butt , including excerpts from Elgar 's The Dream of Gerontius . Between 1915 and 1925 he conducted 65 recordings for Columbia using the early acoustic recording process , including many discs of Wagner excerpts and a truncated version of Elgar 's Violin Concerto with Albert Sammons as soloist . When the microphone and electrical recording were introduced in 1925 , Wood re @-@ recorded the Elgar concerto , with Sammons , and made 36 other discs for Columbia over the next nine years . The 1929 recording of the Elgar concerto has been reissued on compact disc and is well regarded by some critics . 
 Wood was wooed from Columbia by the young Decca company in 1935 . For Decca he conducted 23 recordings over the next two years , including Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony , Elgar 's Enigma Variations and Vaughan Williams 's A London Symphony . In 1938 he returned to Columbia , for whom his five new recordings included the Serenade to Music with the 16 original singers , a few days after the premiere , and his own Fantasia on British Sea Songs . 
 Wood 's recordings did not remain in the catalogues long after his death . The Record Guide , 1956 , lists none of his records . A few of his recordings have subsequently been reissued on compact disc , including the Decca and Columbia Vaughan Williams recordings from 1936 and 1938 . 
 = = Premieres = = 
 In Jacobs 's 1994 biography , the list of premieres conducted by Wood extends to 18 pages . His world premieres included Frank Bridge 's The Sea ; Britten 's Piano Concerto ; Delius 's A Song Before Sunrise , A Song of Summer , and Idyll ; Elgar 's The Wand of Youth Suite No. 1 , <unk> and the 4th and 5th Pomp and Circumstance Marches ; and Vaughan Williams 's Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1 , Flos Campi and Serenade to Music . 
 Wood 's UK premieres included Bartók 's Dance Suite ; Chabrier 's Joyeuse marche ; Copland 's Billy the Kid ; Debussy 's Prélude à l 'après @-@ midi d 'un faune and <unk> ; Hindemith 's <unk> 2 and 5 ; Janáček 's Sinfonietta , Taras Bulba and Glagolitic Mass ; Kodály 's Dances from <unk> ; Mahler 's Symphonies Nos. 4 , 7 and 8 , and Das Lied von der Erde ; Prokofiev 's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Violin Concerto No. 2 ; Rachmaninoff 's Piano Concerto No 1 ; Ravel 's Ma mère l <unk> , Rapsodie espagnole , La valse and Piano Concerto in D ; Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's Capriccio Espagnol , Scheherazade , and Symphony No. 2 ; Saint @-@ Saëns 's The Carnival of the Animals ; Schumann 's <unk> for four horns and orchestra ; Shostakovich 's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Symphonies Nos. 7 and 8 ; Sibelius 's Symphonies Nos. 1 , 6 and 7 , Violin Concerto , Karelia Suite , and Tapiola ; Richard Strauss 's Symphonia Domestica ; Stravinsky 's The Firebird ( suite ) ; Tchaikovsky 's Manfred Symphony and Nutcracker Suite ; and Webern 's Passacaglia . 
 = = Honours , memorials and reputation = = 
 In addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911 , Wood 's state honours were his appointments as Companion of Honour in 1944 , to the Order of the Crown ( Belgium ; 1920 ) , and Officer of the Legion of Honour ( France ; 1926 ) . He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music ( 1920 ) and the Royal College of Music ( 1923 ) . 
 Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood , including , in addition to the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music , works by Elgar , Delius , Bax , Marcel Dupré and Walton . The poet laureate , John Masefield , composed a poem of six verses in his honour , entitled " Sir Henry Wood " , often referred to by its first line , " Where does the uttered music go ? " . Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir ; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre 's , on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained @-@ glass window in Wood 's honour . 
 Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall , the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark , which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975 . His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season , decorated by a chaplet on the Last Night of the Proms . His collection of 2 @,@ 800 orchestral scores and 1 @,@ 920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music . For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund , giving financial aid to students . The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill campus after him . His best @-@ known memorial is the Proms , officially " the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts " , but universally referred to by the informal short version . 
 His biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood : 
 His orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him " Timber " – more than a play on his name , since it seemed to represent his reliability too . His tally of first performances , or first performances in Britain , was heroic : at least 717 works by 357 composers . Greatness as measured by finesse of execution may not be his , particularly in his limited legacy of recordings , but he remains one of the most remarkable musicians Britain has produced . 
 = James Russell Lowell = 
 James Russell Lowell ( / <unk> / ; February 22 , 1819 – August 12 , 1891 ) was an American Romantic poet , critic , editor , and diplomat . He is associated with the Fireside Poets , a group of New England writers who were among the first American poets who rivaled the popularity of British poets . These poets usually used conventional forms and meters in their poetry , making them suitable for families entertaining at their fireside . 
 Lowell graduated from Harvard College in 1838 , despite his reputation as a troublemaker , and went on to earn a law degree from Harvard Law School . He published his first collection of poetry in 1841 and married Maria White in 1844 . He and his wife had several children , though only one survived past childhood . The couple soon became involved in the movement to abolish slavery , with Lowell using poetry to express his anti @-@ slavery views and taking a job in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , as the editor of an abolitionist newspaper . After moving back to Cambridge , Lowell was one of the founders of a journal called The Pioneer , which lasted only three issues . He gained notoriety in 1848 with the publication of A Fable for Critics , a book @-@ length poem satirizing contemporary critics and poets . The same year , he published The Biglow Papers , which increased his fame . He went on to publish several other poetry collections and essay collections throughout his literary career . 
 Maria White died in 1853 , and Lowell accepted a professorship of languages at Harvard in 1854 ; he continued to teach there for twenty years . He traveled to Europe before officially assuming his role in 1856 . He married his second wife , Frances Dunlap , shortly thereafter in 1857 . That year Lowell also became editor of The Atlantic Monthly . It was not until 20 years later that Lowell received his first political appointment , the ambassadorship to the Kingdom of Spain . He was later appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James 's . He spent his last years in Cambridge , in the same estate where he was born , and died there in 1891 . 
 Lowell believed that the poet played an important role as a prophet and critic of society . He used poetry for reform , particularly in abolitionism . However , Lowell 's commitment to the anti @-@ slavery cause wavered over the years , as did his opinion on African @-@ Americans . Lowell attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his characters , particularly in The Biglow Papers . This depiction of the dialect , as well as Lowell 's many satires , was an inspiration to writers like Mark Twain and H.L. Mencken . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 The first of the Lowell family ancestors to come to the United States from Britain was Percival <unk> , who settled in Newbury , Massachusetts , in 1639 . James Russell Lowell was born February 22 , 1819 , the son of the Reverend Charles Russell Lowell , Sr. ( 1782 – 1861 ) , a minister at a Unitarian church in Boston , who had previously studied theology at Edinburgh , and Harriett Brackett Spence Lowell . By the time James Russell Lowell was born , the family owned a large estate in Cambridge called Elmwood . He was the youngest of six children ; his siblings were Charles , Rebecca , Mary , William , and Robert . Lowell 's mother built in him an appreciation for literature at an early age , especially in poetry , ballads , and tales from her native Orkney . He attended school under Sophia Dana , who would later marry George Ripley , and later studied at a school run by a particularly harsh disciplinarian , where one of his classmates was Richard Henry Dana , Jr . 
 Beginning in 1834 , at the age of 15 , Lowell attended Harvard College , though he was not a good student and often got into trouble . In his sophomore year alone , he was absent from required chapel attendance 14 times and from classes 56 times . In his last year there , he wrote , " During Freshman year , I did nothing , during Sophomore year I did nothing , during Junior year I did nothing , and during Senior year I have thus far done nothing in the way of college studies . " In his senior year , he became one of the editors of <unk> literary magazine , to which he contributed prose and poetry that he admitted was of low quality . As he said later , " I was as great an ass as ever <unk> & thought it singing . " During his undergraduate years , Lowell was a member of Hasty Pudding and served both as Secretary and Poet . 
 Lowell was elected the poet of the class of 1838 and , as was tradition , was asked to recite an original poem on Class Day , the day before Commencement , on July 17 , 1838 . Lowell , however , was suspended and not allowed to participate . Instead , his poem was printed and made available thanks to subscriptions paid by his classmates . Lowell had composed the poem in Concord , Massachusetts , where , because of his neglect of his studies , he had been exiled by the Harvard faculty to the care of the Rev. <unk> Frost . During his stay in Concord , he became friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson , and got to know the other Transcendentalists . The poem satirized the social movements of the day ; abolitionists , Thomas Carlyle , Emerson , and the Transcendentalists were treated . 
 Not knowing what vocation to choose after graduating , he vacillated among business , the ministry , medicine , and law . Having decided to practice law , he enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later . While studying law , however , he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines . During this time , Lowell was admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts . He once confided to a friend that he held a cocked pistol to his forehead and considered killing himself at the age of 20 . 
 = = = Marriage and family = = = 
 In late 1839 , Lowell met Maria White through her brother William , a classmate of his at Harvard , and the two became engaged in the autumn of 1840 . Maria 's father <unk> White , a wealthy merchant from Watertown , insisted that their wedding be postponed until Lowell had gainful employment . They were finally married on December 26 , 1844 , shortly after the groom published Conversations on the Old Poets , a collection of his previously published essays . A friend described their relationship as " the very picture of a True Marriage . " Lowell himself believed she was made up " half of earth and more than half of Heaven . " Like Lowell , she wrote poetry , and the next twelve years of Lowell 's life were deeply affected by her influence . He said his first book of poetry , A Year 's Life ( 1841 ) , " owes all its beauty to her , " though it only sold 300 copies . Her character and beliefs led her to become involved in the movements directed against intemperance and slavery . Maria was a member of the Boston Female Anti @-@ Slavery Society and persuaded her husband to become an abolitionist . James had previously expressed antislavery sentiments , but Maria urged him towards more active expression and involvement . His second volume of poems , Miscellaneous Poems , expressed these antislavery thoughts and its 1 @,@ 500 copies sold well . 
 Maria was in poor health , and thinking her lungs could heal there , the couple moved to Philadelphia shortly after their marriage . In Philadelphia , he became a contributing editor for the Pennsylvania Freeman , an abolitionist newspaper . In the spring of 1845 , the Lowells returned to Cambridge , Massachusetts , to make their home at Elmwood . They had four children , though only one ( Mabel , born 1847 ) survived past infancy . Their first , Blanche , was born December 31 , 1845 , but lived only fifteen months ; Rose , born in 1849 , survived only a few months as well ; their only son , Walter , was born in 1850 but died in 1852 . Lowell was very affected by the loss of almost all of his children . His grief over the death of his first daughter in particular was expressed in his poem " The First Snowfall " ( 1847 ) . Again , Lowell considered suicide , writing to a friend that he thought " of my razors and my throat and that I am a fool and a coward not to end it all at once . " 
 = = = Literary career = = = 
 Lowell 's earliest poems were published without remuneration in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1840 . Lowell , inspired to new efforts towards self @-@ support , joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding a literary journal , The Pioneer . The periodical was distinguished by the fact that most of its content was new rather than material that had been previously published elsewhere , and by the inclusion of very serious criticism , which covered not only literature but also art and music . Lowell wrote that it would " furnish the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public with a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice @-@ diluted trash , in the shape of namby @-@ pamby love tales and sketches , which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular Magazines . " William Wetmore Story noted the journal 's higher taste , writing that " it took some stand & <unk> to a higher intellectual Standard than our puerile milk or watery namby @-@ pamby Mags with which we are overrun . " The first issue of the journal included the first appearance of " The Tell @-@ Tale Heart " by Edgar Allan Poe . Lowell , shortly after the first issue , was treated for an eye disease in New York , and in his absence Carter did a poor job of managing the journal . After three monthly numbers , beginning in January 1843 , the magazine ceased publication , leaving Lowell $ 1 @,@ 800 in debt . Poe mourned the journal 's demise , calling it " a most severe blow to the cause — the cause of a Pure Taste . " 
 Despite the failure of The Pioneer , Lowell continued his interest in the literary world . He wrote a series on " Anti @-@ Slavery in the United States " for the London Daily News , though his series was discontinued by the editors after four articles in May 1846 . Lowell had published these articles anonymously , believing they would have more impact if they were not known to be the work of a committed abolitionist . In the spring of 1848 he formed a connection with the National Anti @-@ Slavery Standard of New York , agreeing to contribute weekly either a poem or a prose article . After only one year , he was asked to contribute half as often to the Standard to make room for contributions from Edmund Quincy , another writer and reformer . 
 A Fable for Critics , one of Lowell 's most popular works , was published in 1848 . A satire , it was published anonymously . It proved popular , and the first three thousand copies sold out quickly . In it , Lowell took good @-@ natured jabs at his contemporary poets and critics . Not all the subjects included were pleased , however . Edgar Allan Poe , who had been referred to as part genius and " two @-@ fifths sheer fudge , " reviewed the work in the Southern Literary Messenger and called it " ' loose ' — ill @-@ conceived and feebly executed , as well in detail as in general . ... we confess some surprise at his putting forth so unpolished a performance . " Lowell offered the profits from the book 's success , which proved relatively small , to his New York friend Charles Frederick Briggs , despite his own financial needs . 
 In 1848 , Lowell also published The Biglow Papers , later named by the Grolier Club as the most influential book of 1848 . The first 1 @,@ 500 copies sold out within a week and a second edition was soon issued , though Lowell made no profit , having had to absorb the cost of stereotyping the book himself . The book presented three main characters , each representing different aspects of American life and using authentic American dialects in their dialogue . Under the surface , The Biglow Papers was also a denunciation of the Mexican – American War and war in general . 
 = = = First trip to Europe = = = 
 In 1850 , Lowell 's mother died unexpectedly , as did his third daughter , Rose . Her death left Lowell depressed and reclusive for six months , despite the birth of his son Walter by the end of the year . He wrote to a friend that death " is a private tutor . We have no fellow @-@ scholars , and must lay our lessons to heart alone . " These personal troubles as well as the Compromise of 1850 inspired Lowell to accept an offer from William Wetmore Story to spend a winter in Italy . To pay for the trip , Lowell sold land around Elmwood , intending to sell off further acres of the estate over time to supplement his income , ultimately selling off 25 of the original 30 acres ( 120 @,@ 000 m2 ) . Walter died suddenly in Rome of cholera , and Lowell and his wife , with their daughter Mabel , returned to the United States in October 1852 . Lowell published recollections of his journey in several magazines , many of which would be collected years later as Fireside Travels ( 1867 ) . He also edited volumes with biographical sketches for a series on British Poets . 
 His wife Maria , who had been suffering from poor health for many years , became very ill in the spring of 1853 and died on October 27 of tuberculosis . Just before her burial , her coffin was opened so that her daughter Mabel could see her face while Lowell " leaned for a long while against a tree weeping , " according to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his wife , who were in attendance . In 1855 , Lowell oversaw the publication of a memorial volume of his wife 's poetry , with only fifty copies for private circulation . Despite his self @-@ described " naturally joyous " nature , life for Lowell at Elmwood was further complicated by his father becoming deaf in his old age , and the deteriorating mental state of his sister Rebecca , who sometimes went a week without speaking . He again cut himself off from others , becoming reclusive at Elmwood , and his private diaries from this time period are riddled with the initials of his wife . On March 10 , 1854 , for example , he wrote : " Dark without & within . M.L. M.L. M.L. " Longfellow , a friend and neighbor , referred to Lowell as " lonely and desolate . "

 At the invitation of his cousin John Amory Lowell , James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute . Some speculated the opportunity was because of the family connection , offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression . Lowell chose to speak on " The English Poets , " telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets " for the injuries received by one whom the public won 't allow among the living . " The first of the twelve @-@ part lecture series was to be on January 9 , 1855 , though by December , Lowell had only completed writing five of them , hoping for last @-@ minute inspiration . His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold ; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon . Lowell , who had never spoken in public before , was praised for these lectures . Francis James Child said that Lowell , whom he deemed was typically " perverse , " was able to " persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents . " While his series was still in progress , Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard , a post vacated by Longfellow , at an annual salary of $ 1 @,@ 200 , though he never applied for it . The job description was changing after Longfellow ; instead of teaching languages directly , Lowell would supervise the department and deliver two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing . Lowell accepted the appointment , with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad . He set sail on June 4 of that year , leaving his daughter Mabel in the care of a governess named Frances Dunlap . Abroad , he visited Le Havre , Paris , and London , spending time with friends including Story , Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning , and Leigh Hunt . Primarily , however , Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages , particularly German , which he found difficult . He complained : " The confounding genders ! If I die I shall have engraved on my tombstone that I died of der , die , das , not because I caught them but because I couldn 't . " 
 He returned to the United States in the summer of 1856 and began his college duties . Towards the end of his professorship , then @-@ president of Harvard Charles William Eliot noted that Lowell seemed to have " no natural inclination " to teach ; Lowell agreed , but retained his position for twenty years . He focused on teaching literature , rather than etymology , hoping that his students would learn to enjoy the sound , rhythm , and flow of poetry rather than the technique of words . He summed up his method : " True scholarship consists in knowing not what things exists , but what they mean ; it is not memory but judgment . " Still grieving the loss of his wife , during this time Lowell avoided Elmwood and instead lived on Kirkland Street in Cambridge , an area known as Professors ' Row . He stayed there , along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap , until January 1861 . 
 Lowell had intended never to remarry after the death of his wife Maria White . However , in 1857 , surprising his friends , he became engaged to Frances Dunlap , who many described as simple and unattractive . Dunlap , niece of the former governor of Maine Robert P. Dunlap , was a friend of Lowell 's first wife and formerly wealthy , though she and her family had fallen into reduced circumstances . Lowell and Dunlap married on September 16 , 1857 , in a ceremony performed by his brother . Lowell wrote , " My second marriage was the wisest act of my life , & as long as I am sure of it , I can afford to wait till my friends agree with me . "

 In the autumn of 1857 , The Atlantic Monthly was established , and Lowell was its first editor . With its first issue in November of that year , he at once gave the magazine the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs . In January 1861 , Lowell 's father died of a heart attack , inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood . As he wrote to his friend Briggs , " I am back again to the place I love best . I am sitting in my old garret , at my old desk , smoking my old pipe ... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years . " Shortly thereafter , in May , he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor ; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $ 10 @,@ 000 two years before . Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal , continuing to submit his poetry and prose for the rest of his life . His prose , however , was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862 – 1872 . For the Review , he served as a <unk> along with Charles Eliot Norton . Lowell 's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day , though he was writing fewer poems . 
 As early as 1845 , Lowell had predicted the debate over slavery would lead to war and , as the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s , Lowell used his role at the Review to praise Abraham Lincoln and his attempts to maintain the Union . Lowell lost three nephews during the war , including Charles Russell Lowell , Jr , who became a Brigadier General and fell at the battle of Cedar Creek . Lowell himself was generally a pacifist . Even so , he wrote , " If the destruction of slavery is to be a consequence of the war , shall we regret it ? If it be needful to the successful prosecution of the war , shall anyone oppose it ? " His interest in the Civil War inspired him to write a second series of The Biglow Papers , including one specifically dedicated to the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation called " <unk> ' in the Pastoral Line " in 1862 . 
 Shortly after Lincoln 's assassination , Lowell was asked to present a poem at Harvard in memory of graduates killed in the war . His poem , " Commemoration Ode , " cost him sleep and his appetite , but was delivered on July 21 , 1865 , after a 48 @-@ hour writing binge . Lowell had high hopes for his performance but was overshadowed by the other notables presenting works that day , including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes , Sr. " I did not make the hit I expected , " he wrote , " and am ashamed at having been tempted again to think I could write poetry , a delusion from which I have been tolerably free these dozen years . " Despite his personal assessment , friends and other poets sent many letters to Lowell congratulating him . Emerson referred to his poem 's " high thought & sentiment " and James Freeman Clarke noted its " grandeur of tone . " Lowell later expanded it with a strophe to Lincoln . 
 In the 1860s , Lowell 's friend Longfellow spent several years translating Dante Alighieri 's Divine Comedy and regularly invited others to help him on Wednesday evenings . Lowell was one of the main members of the so @-@ called " Dante Club , " along with William Dean Howells , Charles Eliot Norton and other occasional guests . Shortly after serving as a pallbearer at the funeral of friend and publisher Nathaniel Parker Willis , on January 24 , 1867 , Lowell decided to produce another collection of his poetry . Under the Willows and Other Poems was released in 1869 , though Lowell originally wanted to title it The Voyage to the Vinland and Other Poems . The book , dedicated to Norton , collected poems Lowell had written within the previous twenty years and was his first poetry collection since 1848 . 
 Lowell intended to take another trip to Europe . To finance it , he sold off more of Elmwood 's acres and rented the house to Thomas Bailey Aldrich ; Lowell 's daughter Mabel , by this time , had moved into a new home with her husband Edward Burnett , the son of a successful businessman @-@ farmer from <unk> , Massachusetts . Lowell and his wife set sail on July 8 , 1872 , after he took a leave of absence from Harvard . They visited England , Paris , Switzerland , and Italy . While overseas , he received an honorary Doctorate of Law from the University of Oxford and another from Cambridge University . They returned to the United States in the summer of 1874 .

 Lowell resigned from his Harvard professorship in 1874 , though he was persuaded to continue teaching through 1877 . It was in 1876 that Lowell first stepped into the field of politics . That year , he served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Cincinnati , Ohio , speaking on behalf of presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes . Hayes won the nomination and , eventually , the presidency . In May 1877 , President Hayes , an admirer of The Biglow Papers , sent William Dean Howells to Lowell with a handwritten note proffering an ambassadorship to either Austria or Russia ; Lowell declined , but noted his interest in Spanish literature . Lowell was then offered and accepted the role of Minister to the court of Spain at an annual salary of $ 12 @,@ 000 . Lowell sailed from Boston on July 14 , 1877 , and , though he expected he would be away for a year or two , he would not return to the United States until 1885 , with the violinist Ole Bull renting Elmwood for a portion of that time . The Spanish media referred to him as " José <unk> . " Lowell was well @-@ prepared for his political role , having been trained in law , as well as being able to read in multiple languages . He had trouble socializing while in Spain , however , and amused himself by sending humorous dispatches to his political bosses in the United States , many of which were later collected and published posthumously in 1899 as Impressions of Spain . Lowell 's social life improved when the Spanish Academy elected him a corresponding member in late 1878 , allowing him contribute to the preparation of a new dictionary . 
 In January 1880 , Lowell was informed he was appointed Minister to England , his nomination made without his knowledge as far back as June 1879 . He was granted a salary of $ 17 @,@ 500 with about $ 3 @,@ 500 for expenses . While serving in this capacity , he addressed an importation of allegedly diseased cattle and made recommendations that predated the Pure Food and Drug Act . Queen Victoria commented that she had never seen an ambassador who " created so much interest and won so much regard as Mr. Lowell . " Lowell held this role until the close of Chester A. Arthur 's presidency in the spring of 1885 , despite his wife 's failing health . Lowell was already well known in England for his writing and , during his time there , he befriended fellow author Henry James , who referred to him as " conspicuously American . " Lowell also befriended Leslie Stephen many years earlier and became the godfather to his daughter , future writer Virginia Woolf . Lowell was popular enough that he was offered a professorship at Oxford after his recall by president Grover Cleveland , though the offer was declined . 
 His second wife , Frances , died on February 19 , 1885 , while still in England .

 He returned to the United States by June 1885 , living with his daughter and her husband in <unk> , Massachusetts . He then spent time in Boston with his sister before returning to Elmwood in November 1889 . By this time , most of his friends were dead , including Quincy , Longfellow , Dana , and Emerson , leaving him depressed and contemplating suicide again . Lowell spent part of the 1880s delivering various speeches , and his last published works were mostly collections of essays , including Political Essays , and a collection of his poems <unk> and Rue in 1888 . His last few years he traveled back to England periodically and when he returned to the United States in the fall of 1889 , he moved back to Elmwood with Mabel , while her husband worked for clients in New York and New Jersey . That year , Lowell gave an address at the centenary of George Washington 's inauguration . Also that year , the Boston Critic dedicated a special issue to Lowell on his seventieth birthday to recollections and reminiscences by his friends , including former presidents Hayes and Benjamin Harrison and British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone as well as Alfred Tennyson and Francis Parkman . 
 In the last few months of his life , Lowell struggled with gout , sciatica in his left leg , and chronic nausea ; by the summer of 1891 , doctors believed that Lowell had cancer in his kidneys , liver , and lungs . His last few months , he was administered opium for the pain and was rarely fully conscious . He died on August 12 , 1891 , at Elmwood . After services in the Appleton Chapel , he was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery . After his death , Norton served as his literary executor and published several collections of Lowell 's works and his letters .
