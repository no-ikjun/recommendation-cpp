 = = Airlines and destinations = = 
 In 2011 , Iloilo International Airport serviced an average of 42 flights daily on four domestic routes . At the time of its opening , the ATO believed that international flights out of and to the airport might not begin until 2008 , although international passenger flights could commence once Iloilo International Airport meets ICAO standards . A study was conducted on the feasibility of the airport serving international flights , and the <unk> recently announced that the airport meets ICAO standards , allowing for international flights to land at the airport . 
 The DOTC plans to stage international cargo flights out of the airport , as sixty percent of Philippine seafood exports come from Panay . Japan and Hong Kong have been cited as potential first destinations of these cargo flights . 
 On January 31 , 2008 , the Iloilo city government announced that Cebu Pacific was considering starting international services from Iloilo , initially with a route to Hong Kong to cater to the large number of Overseas Filipinos there . Philippine Airlines later announced its intent to serve this route as well , suggesting that Iloilo tourism authorities mount thrice @-@ weekly charter flights to the city using PAL Airbus A320 aircraft . City government officials also believed that the opening of a Cathay Pacific office in Iloilo City may bode well for future service to Hong Kong . In addition to Hong Kong flights , the Center for Research and Communication of the University of Asia and the Pacific has called for flights from Iloilo City to Japan , South Korea and mainland China . The first international flight from Iloilo International Airport departed on November 8 , 2012 , to Hong Kong . 
 PAL Express , a subsidiary of Philippine Airlines , is considering a direct route from Iloilo to Malay to boost Boracay @-@ bound tourism traffic . A resolution passed by the Iloilo City Local Development Council ( <unk> ) called on PAL president Jaime Bautista to institute direct flights to Malay from Iloilo , with onward service to Cebu City on the return portion from Malay . However , PAL has questioned the route 's feasibility , citing congestion at <unk> P. Ramos Airport which serves that municipality .

 = Meteorological history of Hurricane Ivan = 
 The meteorological history of Hurricane Ivan , the longest tracked tropical cyclone of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season , lasted from late August through late September . The hurricane developed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 31 . Tracking westward due to a ridge , favorable conditions allowed it to develop into Tropical Depression Nine on September 2 in the deep tropical Atlantic Ocean . The cyclone gradually intensified until September 5 , when it underwent rapid deepening and reached Category 4 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale ; at the time Ivan was the southernmost major North Atlantic hurricane on record . 
 Ivan quickly weakened due to dry air , but it gradually reorganized , passing just south of Grenada as a major hurricane on September 7 . The hurricane attained Category 5 status in the central Caribbean Sea . Over the subsequent days its intensity fluctuated largely due to eyewall replacement cycles , and Ivan passed just south of Jamaica , the Cayman Islands , and western Cuba with winds at or slightly below Category 5 status . Turning northward and encountering unfavorable conditions , Ivan gradually weakened before making landfall just west of Gulf Shores , Alabama on September 16 with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . The cyclone quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it turned to the northeast , and Ivan transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 18 . 
 The remnant low of Ivan turned to the south and southwest , and after crossing Florida on September 21 it began to reacquire tropical characteristics . It became a tropical depression again on September 22 to the southeast of Louisiana , and Ivan reached winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) before weakening and moving ashore along southwestern Louisiana as a tropical depression ; the circulation of Ivan dissipated after crossing into Texas on September 25 . The cyclone broke several intensity records , and its duration was the tenth longest on record for an Atlantic hurricane . 
 = = Formation and intensification = = 
 On August 31 , a large tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa . A tropical system along the wave axis contained a low pressure area as well as an impressive outflow pattern , though initially its convection was disorganized and limited . By September 1 a cyclonic circulation with a diameter of 690 mile ( 1115 km ) was evident on satellite imagery , well to the southeast of the Cape Verde Islands , and several hurricane forecast models anticipated development and strengthening . As it tracked quickly westward , the convection organized and developed into rainbands – bands of showers and thunderstorms that spiral cyclonically toward the storm center – and late on September 1 meteorologists began tracking the system using the Dvorak technique . Low amounts of wind shear and favorable outflow allowed vigorous deep convection to develop and persist near the center , and by 1800 UTC on September 2 the system developed into Tropical Depression Nine about 450 miles ( 730 km ) southwest of Praia , Cape Verde . 
 Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone , the depression was embedded within a deep easterly steering current provided by a ridge to its north . Expected to track across sea surface temperatures greater than 82 ° F ( 28 ° C ) , the cyclone was forecast to gradually strengthen and within four days attain hurricane status ; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the depression to reach Category 4 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale within three days . Increased northeasterly wind shear shifted the center to the northeastern edge of the deep convection , and despite the shear and its relatively low latitude of 9 @.@ 7 ° N , the depression strengthened to attain tropical storm status early on September 3 ; upon reaching the intensity , the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Storm Ivan . 
 Tropical Storm Ivan gradually became better organized as wind shear decreased , and its outflow expanded in all quadrants . Satellite imagery late on September 3 depicted a well @-@ defined curved band wrapping around much of the circulation . The next day , the deep convection temporarily became ill @-@ defined , before reorganizing and developing an eye feature . Convection strengthened further as the feature transitioned into an eye , and Ivan became a hurricane at around 0600 UTC on September 5 . After reaching hurricane status , Ivan began to rapidly intensify with continued favorable conditions , and in an 18 ‑ hour period the pressure dropped 39 mbar ( 1 @.@ 15 inHg ) as the winds increased by 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) ; early on September 6 Ivan attained an initial peak intensity of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) while located about 825 miles ( 1330 km ) east of the island of Tobago in the southern Lesser Antilles . 
 While at major hurricane status , Ivan maintained very strong convection in its core with a well @-@ defined eye . Operationally , the probability for further rapid strengthening was considered nearly nine times the average of a typical hurricane . Accordingly , Ivan was forecast to pass near Barbados with winds of about 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . Shortly after attaining Category 4 status , the outer convection of the hurricane became ragged . Hurricane Hunters found a Saharan Air Layer in the northern portion of the eye , leaving the eyewall eroded which caused a marked decrease in winds ; by late on September 6 Ivan weakened to winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . The inner eyewall dissipated as a 23 mile ( 37 km ) outer eyewall became dominant , and concurrently the overall organization of the hurricane improved . Ivan again attained major hurricane status as it approached the Lesser Antilles , and at 2130 UTC on September 7 the cyclone passed 7 miles ( 11 km ) south @-@ southwest of the southern tip of Grenada , its closest approach to the island . At the time , the hurricane maintained an eye diameter of 12 miles ( 19 km ) , with the northern portion of the eyewall producing strong winds on the island . The hurricane brought strong winds to Grenada , and tropical storm force winds were reported as far north as Dominica . 
 = = Caribbean Sea = = 
 Hurricane Ivan again reached Category 4 status as it entered the Caribbean Sea . Subsequently , it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle , and for about 18 hours the intensity remained constant as it paralleled the northern coast of Venezuela offshore . Another period of rapid deepening began late on September 8 as its motion turned to the west @-@ northwest . Hurricane Hunters recorded flight @-@ level sustained winds of 180 mph ( 290 km / h ) to the north and northeast of the eye , and a dropsonde about 630 feet ( 190 m ) above the surface recorded winds of 200 mph ( 325 km / h ) and an extrapolated pressure of 916 mbar ( 27 @.@ 05 inHg ) . Based on the reports , it is estimated Ivan attained Category 5 status at 0600 UTC on September 9 , while located about 90 miles ( 145 km ) north of Aruba . At the time , the cyclone was forecast to strike southern Florida as a major hurricane . 
 After maintaining Category 5 status for about 12 hours , Ivan began a steady weakening trend due to another eyewall replacement cycle until reaching winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) on September 10 . Early next day , the hurricane reorganized as it reached winds just shy of Category 5 status . However , weakening occurred again due to an eyewall replacement cycle , and at 0330 UTC on September 11 Ivan passed 23 miles ( 37 km ) south of Portland Point , Jamaica , its closest approach , with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . The hurricane was previously forecast to make landfall on the island , though the weakening and a turn to the west kept the strongest winds offshore ; however , sustained winds of Category 4 status were reported . While passing to the south of the island , the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall , with several stations reporting over 2 feet ( 60 cm ) of precipitation . Ivan 's last @-@ minute turn to the west was due to a mid @-@ level high pressure system over the eastern Gulf of Mexico . A slight weakening trend continued after passing the island , due to its northern outflow being disrupted by an upper @-@ level low over the Bahamas . As it tracked further away from Jamaica , Ivan again rapidly intensified to Category 5 status , and early on September 12 it reached its peak intensity of 165 mph ( 265 km / h ) with a pressure of 910 mbar ( 26 @.@ 87 inHg ) . 
 Shortly after peaking in intensity , the hurricane again weakened as it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle . At 1415 UTC on September 12 Ivan passed 25 miles ( 40 km ) south @-@ southwest of George Town , Cayman Islands , with sustained winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) were reported . The storm surge from the hurricane flooded all of Grand Cayman Island . After its eyewall became re @-@ established Ivan attained Category 5 status for a third time early on September 13 . Shortly thereafter , a trough created a weakness in the ridge to its north , causing the hurricane to turn to the northwest . The combination of enhanced outflow from the trough and very warm waters allowed Ivan to maintain Category 5 status for 30 hours . Early on September 14 the hurricane passed through the Yucatán Channel about 17 miles ( 28 km ) southwest of Cabo San Antonio , Cuba , with the eastern portion of the eyewall crossing the western portion of the island . Only the extreme western portion of the island experienced hurricane force winds , although rainfall from the hurricane was reported across the island . 
 = = Gulf of Mexico and Alabama landfall = = 
 After entering the southern Gulf of Mexico , Hurricane Ivan weakened to Category 4 status by 0600 UTC on September 14 . As it gradually turned to the north , southwesterly flow from a large trough over the central United States increased wind shear over the hurricane . An eyewall replacement cycle , along with dry air and restricted outflow , contributed to the weakening . By late on September 14 the weakening trend ceased as the eyewall became better defined , and Ivan was expected to restrengthen slightly over an area of warmer water temperatures . The eye diameter expanded to 60 miles ( 95 km / h ) , though concurrently westerly wind shear and dry continued to increase . As Ivan approached the Gulf Coast of the United States , Hurricane Hunters reported erosion of the southern portion of the eyewall , and cooler waters just offshore contributed to further weakening . At around <unk> UTC on September 16 , Hurricane Ivan made landfall just west of Gulf Shores , Alabama with an intensity of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) ; the strongest winds occurred over a narrow area near the southern Alabama and western Florida border . Its landfall was accompanied by a 10 – 15 feet ( 3 – 4 @.@ 5 m ) storm surge from Destin , Florida westward to Mobile Bay . 
 Upon moving ashore , the National Hurricane Center expected the forward path of Ivan to be blocked , and accordingly forecast the hurricane to stall in the southern Appalachian Mountains before dissipating . As the hurricane crossed Mobile Bay it turned to the north @-@ northeast , and within twelve hours Ivan rapidly weakened to tropical storm status . The circulation became less @-@ defined , and early on September 17 the cyclone deteriorated into a tropical depression over northeastern Alabama . Ivan accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front , dropping heavy rainfall along its path and also producing a widespread tornado outbreak from Alabama through Maryland . Late on September 18 , the remnants of Ivan transitioned into an extratropical low as it merged with the cold front over the Delmarva Peninsula . 
 = = Redevelopment and demise = = 
 After becoming an extratropical low , the remnants of Ivan turned to the southeast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean , due to the building of an upper @-@ level ridge to its east . As an extratropical cyclone , Ivan remained identifiable in both surface and upper @-@ level data , and the system turned south and southwestward over the subsequent days . By September 20 , the system was located off the east coast of Florida , producing scattered thunderstorms ; unfavorable wind shear prevented tropical redevelopment , though forecasters indicated the possibility for more favorable conditions a few days later . On September 21 the low crossed southern Florida and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico , and as it moved across the warm waters of the region the low began to re @-@ acquire tropical characteristics ; the low @-@ level circulation became increasingly better defined , and convection redeveloped over the center . Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters , it is estimated the low redeveloped into Tropical Depression Ivan late on September 22 while located about 175 miles ( 280 km ) south @-@ southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River . 
 In its first advisory on the re @-@ developed cyclone , the National Hurricane Center classified the system Ivan " after considerable and sometimes animated in @-@ house discussion of [ its demise ] ... in the midst of a low @-@ pressure and surface frontal system over the eastern United States ... based primarily on the reasonable continuity observed in the analysis of the surface and low @-@ level circulation . " Despite unfavorable shear and its disorganized cloud structure , the cyclone intensified to tropical storm status early on September 23 , based on Hurricane Hunter reports . As an area of deep convection developed over the center , Ivan reached winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , though the winds decreased as thunderstorm activity diminished . Ivan weakened to a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 24 , and two hours later it moved ashore near Holly Beach , Louisiana . Initial computer models forecast the low @-@ level circulation to turn southwestward and re @-@ emerge into the Gulf of Mexico . However , the storm rapidly weakened over land , and by 1200 UTC on September 24 Ivan degenerated into a remnant low pressure area over southeastern Texas . The low turned to the south and the circulation dissipated early on September 25 . The remnant trough reached the northwestern Gulf of Mexico later that day , briefly producing scatter thunderstorms before it diminished . 
 = = Records = = 
 Reaching Category 3 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale at 10 @.@ 2 ° N , Ivan became the southernmost major hurricane on record . Additionally , the hurricane attained Category 4 and Category 5 status further south than any other North Atlantic hurricane , at 10 @.@ 6 ° N and 13 @.@ 7 ° N , respectively . At the time , Ivan was the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record ; it has since dropped to tenth . Throughout its duration , Ivan maintained winds of major hurricane status or greater for a total of 10 days , establishing an Atlantic hurricane record . Lasting as a tropical cyclone for a total of 450 hours , Ivan was the tenth longest tracked Atlantic hurricane on record . 
 Upon making its first landfall in the United States , the hurricane spawned a total of 117 tornadoes , which is the largest tornado outbreak associated with a tropical cyclone ; this broke the previous record of 115 set by Hurricane Beulah in 1967 . 
 = U.S. Route 41 in Michigan = 
 US Highway 41 ( US 41 ) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System that runs from Miami , Florida , to the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . In Michigan , it is a state trunkline highway that enters the state via the Interstate Bridge between Marinette , Wisconsin , and Menominee , Michigan . The 278 @.@ 769 miles ( 448 @.@ 635 km ) of US 41 that lie within Michigan serve as a major conduit . Most of the highway is listed on the National Highway System . Various sections are rural two @-@ lane highway , urbanized four @-@ lane divided expressway and the Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway . The northernmost community along the highway is Copper Harbor at the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula . The trunkline ends at a cul @-@ de @-@ sac east of Fort Wilkins State Park after serving the Central Upper Peninsula and Copper Country regions of Michigan . 
 US 41 passes through farm fields and forest lands , and along the Lake Superior shoreline . The highway is included in the Lake Superior Circle Tour and the Lake Michigan Circle Tour and passes through the Hiawatha National Forest and the Keweenaw National Historical Park . Historical landmarks along the trunkline include the Marquette Branch Prison , Peshekee River Bridge and the Quincy Mine . The highway is known for a number of historic bridges such as a lift bridge , the northernmost span in the state and a structure referred to as " one of Michigan 's most important vehicular bridges " by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . Seven memorial highway designations have been applied to parts of the trunkline since 1917 , one of them named for a Civil War general . 
 US 41 was first designated as a US Highway in 1926 . A section of the highway originally served as part of Military Road , a connection between Fort Wilkins and Fort Howard during the Civil War . US 41 replaced the original M @-@ 15 designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Michigan state trunkline highway system . M @-@ 15 ran from Menominee through Marquette to Houghton and ended in Copper Harbor . Realignments and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes in Delta and Marquette counties and have created three business loops off the main highway .

 US 41 is a major highway for Michigan traffic in the Upper Peninsula . The 278 @.@ 769 @-@ mile ( 448 @.@ 635 km ) highway comprises mostly two lanes ; it is undivided except for the sections that are concurrent with US 2 near Escanaba and M @-@ 28 near Marquette . US 41 / M @-@ 28 is a four @-@ lane expressway along the " Marquette Bypass " , and segments of the highway in Delta and Marquette counties have four lanes . The route from the southern terminus to downtown Houghton is part of the National Highway System , a system of roadways considered important to the nation 's economy , defense and mobility . Sections of the trunkline are on the Lake Superior and Lake Michigan circle tours .

The trunkline runs north through rolling farmland in the central Menominee County communities of Wallace , Stephenson , and the twin communities of Carney and Nadeau . At Powers , US 41 joins with US 2 ; the two highways run concurrently and turn east toward Escanaba . US 2 / US 41 crosses into the <unk> Indian Community at the communities of Harris in Menominee County and Bark River in Delta County . The county line between the two communities marks the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones . 
 Just west of downtown Escanaba , US 2 / US 41 joins M @-@ 35 at the intersection of Ludington Street and Lincoln Road , the center of the Escanaba street grid . The trunkline enters Escanaba from the west on Ludington Street , turns north on Lincoln Road , and joins M @-@ 35 . The combined highway then runs north adjacent to Little Bay de Noc using a four @-@ lane divided highway to the city of Gladstone , where M @-@ 35 turns west along 4th Avenue North . US 2 / US 41 continues on a four @-@ lane expressway north to Rapid River at the end of Little Bay de Noc . There , US 2 turns east , and US 41 turns north and inland to cross the Upper Peninsula . 
 The section of US 41 between Menominee and Escanaba illustrates an anomaly in the highway routing : between these two cities M @-@ 35 is the shortest state trunkline highway . Under American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials guidelines , US Highways are to follow the most direct path between two locations , but US 41 runs inland and M @-@ 35 goes more directly up the Lake Michigan shoreline . According to the 2007 MDOT state highway map , the US 41 routing runs for 65 miles ( 105 km ) versus 55 miles ( 89 km ) for M @-@ 35 . The original map for the US Highway System shows US 41 continuing north from Powers on a direct line to Marquette . This routing would be more direct than the current US 41 routing via Escanaba and Rapid River , but has not been built .

 US 41 / M @-@ 28 runs north along the Lake Superior shoreline , passing the Marquette Branch Prison and crossing the Carp River before cresting Shiras Hill on the way into the city of Marquette , entering town on Front Street . South of downtown , the highway turns west on the Marquette Bypass , a four @-@ lane expressway complete with two overpasses . The bypass moves traffic around the former routing of US 41 / M @-@ 28 along Front and Washington streets , a routing that was used for Business US 41 ( Bus . US 41 ) until 2005 . West of Washington Street , US 41 / M @-@ 28 follows a heavily trafficked business corridor .

 Continuing north from Alberta , US 41 enters the town of L 'Anse on the east side of Keweenaw Bay , rounding the bay to the town of Baraga . Both towns are a part of the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community . US 41 continues along the shores of the bay north into Houghton County , turning along Portage Lake near <unk> . 
 US 41 enters Houghton along Townsend Drive on the campus of MTU . After crossing the campus , it uses College Avenue into downtown . There , US 41 is split along the one @-@ way pairing of Sheldon Avenue for northbound and Montezuma Avenue for southbound traffic . The two streets merge west of downtown at the south end of the Portage Lake Lift Bridge . Downtown Houghton marks the start of the Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway . 
 North of the lift bridge , US 41 turns west through the downtown of Hancock using the one @-@ way pairing of Quincy Street northbound and Hancock Street southbound . The trunkline then follows Lincoln Drive after merging the two directions west of downtown . The highway continues up Quincy Hill and out of town , passing the Quincy Mine at the top of the hill . North of Hancock , US 41 passes the Houghton County Memorial Airport before reaching the towns of Calumet and Laurium . US 41 merges with M @-@ 26 in Calumet , and they follow the center of the Keweenaw Peninsula to the community of Phoenix .

 = = History = = 
 There are two major eras of the history of US 41 . The first dates back to the Civil War and a wagon road built by the federal government . The Military Road was built to connect the Copper Country with Wisconsin . After the establishment of the state trunkline highway system , a segment of the Military Road was used for M @-@ 15 , the predecessor of US 41 . 
 = = = Military Road = = = 
 The northernmost section of the modern US 41 between Houghton and Copper Harbor originated in the 19th century as the Military Road . The road was one of 13 roads built between 1817 and 1864 by the federal government . Construction of the road was proposed as early as two years after the US acquired the last tracts of land in the Upper Peninsula . Congress asked Secretary of War William Wilkins for funding to build such a road in 1844 , since the area depended on a land connection to Green Bay , Wisconsin , for up to six months a year for supplies and mail . The estimate for a 220 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 350 km ) , 33 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 10 m ) crude road was $ 37 @,@ 400 ( equivalent to $ 21 @.@ 8 million in 2015 ) . The matter died until 1848 when the Michigan Legislature petitioned Congress for an appropriation to build to connect Green Bay to the Keweenaw Bay . The appeal went unfulfilled by the government , but private groups stepped in . Mail service was available overland once a month during the winter from Green Bay . In 1857 , the Legislature enacted a law to provide a road from Eagle Harbor south to Ontonagon . This road was extended south to the state line pursuant to two laws in 1859 . 
 The Civil War refocused discussions about the road . There were fears that Great Britain would enter on the side of the Confederacy during the early days of the war . British troops were as close to Michigan as Ontario , and more than half of the copper used in the US came from mines along the proposed roadway . Control of the area could have been established by seizing the Soo Locks at Sault Ste . Marie , severing communication lines through the Great Lakes . If the locks fell to an enemy force , no troops or supplies could be moved to the Copper Country except by land . The road was also needed during the five or six months of the year that transportation on the Great Lakes was barred by ice or stormy weather . 
 Congress passed a law to build a military wagon road on March 3 , 1863 from Fort Wilkins to Houghton and then south to the state line . The road was laid out in 1864 following what is today M @-@ 26 between Copper Harbor and Phoenix , US 41 south to Houghton , M @-@ 26 south to Winona and Federal Forest Highway 16 ( FFH @-@ 16 ) to the state line . Wisconsin authorities ran the road along what is now Highway 29 between Green Bay and Shawano and Highway 55 north to the state line . Military Road would connect Fort Wilkins with Fort Howard near Green Bay . 
 The laws setting up the construction of the Military Road established a five @-@ year deadline for construction . The war removed laborers in mining , lumbering and shipping as well as soldiers from the available workforce , and Congress extended the deadline an additional 21 months in June 1868 . A second extension was granted in May 1870 . The Wisconsin section of the highway was completed on June 20 , 1870 . The Houghton County segment was finished in January 1871 . The Keweenaw County section was completed by August 1871 . A third and final extension on the deadline was needed in April 1872 , and the roadway was completed south to the state line in September 1873 , shifting the southern segment in the Upper Peninsula west to the modern US 45 corridor in place of the FFH @-@ 16 alignment . 
 In payment for the completion of the road , close to 221 @,@ 000 acres ( 89 @,@ 000 ha ) were awarded by the federal government to the corporation , including some 174 @,@ 000 acres ( 70 @,@ 000 ha ) to Dr James Ayer of Lowell , Massachusetts , for his investments in the company . Most of the remaining land grants went to the company behind the Portage Lake Canal near Houghton and Hancock . Ayer 's holdings were controlled by the trustees of his estate after his death in July 1878 . A few thousand acres were sold over time , and the trustees benefitted from the sale of timber and the mineral rights . The profits had been exhausted by 1921 , and the remaining tracts were sold to a lumberman from Grand Rapids for $ 2 @.@ 3 million ( equivalent to $ 187 million in 2015 ) . 
 Railroads built near the Military Road attracted more traffic than the road . The road was not well built ; except in the winter when the weather froze the ground or covered it in snow , the road was barely passable . Most of the 140 @-@ mile ( 225 km ) highway was converted into a state trunkline between 1913 and 1920 , mostly as M @-@ 15 or M @-@ 26 . Remnants of the original Military Road can be found as backwoods trails labeled " Old Military Road " on maps , or as a street in Ripley near Hancock called " Military Road " . 
 = = = State trunkline = = = 
 The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 41 was M @-@ 15 , in use as far back as 1919 . The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M @-@ 15 with three different US Highways . Between Menominee and Powers , M @-@ 15 was to follow the route that US 41 follows today . East of Powers to Rapid River , the trunkline would have been just US 2 . The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US 102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US 41 In between Powers and Covington , US 41 was planned to follow US 2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US 141 between Powers and Covington . When the system was created on November 11 , 1926 , US 41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M @-@ 15 . The original map showed US 41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette . The new US 41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M @-@ 15 . 
 The 1927 edition of the official Michigan highway service map was the first to show M @-@ 28 extended along US 41 into Marquette County and east over the former M @-@ 25 through Munising and Newberry , before ending in downtown Sault Ste . Marie . At Negaunee , M @-@ 28 was shown along the previous routing of M @-@ 15 between Negaunee and Marquette for 10 miles ( 16 km ) , while US 41 ran along a portion of M @-@ 35 . This southern loop routing of M @-@ 28 lasted until approximately 1936 , when M @-@ 28 was displayed as concurrent with US 41 . The former route is now Marquette County Road 492 ( CR 492 ) . Around 1930 , the northern terminus of US 41 was extended east from Copper Harbor to Fort Wilkins State Park . Another realignment shown in 1937 marked the transfer of US 41 / M @-@ 28 out of downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee . This former routing later became Bus . M @-@ 28 . The highway was realigned due north between Rapid River and Trenary according to the 1938 service map . US 41 was completely paved in 1951 . The final two sections to be paved were in Baraga County and Keweenaw County . 
 M @-@ 35 was routed concurrently with US 41 between Negaunee and Baraga by 1953 . This extra concurrency connected the two previously disconnected segments of M @-@ 35 . The Portage Lake Bridge opened in 1959 at a cost of $ 13 million ( equivalent to $ 246 million in 2015 ) . 
 The Marquette Bypass was opened in November 1963 as a four @-@ lane expressway south of downtown Marquette at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 281 million in 2015 ) . Washington and Front streets in Marquette were redesignated as Bus . US 41 at this time . While the expressway was being built , a large vein of jasper exposed , and gifts fashioned from the mineral were presented to local and state politicians . A set of cufflinks to be given to President John F. Kennedy was never presented because he was killed in Dallas just hours after the Marquette Bypass opened to traffic . 
 The concurrency with M @-@ 35 through Marquette and Baraga counties was removed from maps in 1968 . M @-@ 35 west of Baraga was designated as a new M @-@ 38 and M @-@ 35 was shortened to its current northern terminus . Another expressway section of US 41 was denoted along US 2 / US 41 between Gladstone and Rapid River in 1972 . A Bus . M @-@ 28 designation was added to Bus . US 41 on the MDOT map in 1975 , making it similar to the former Bus . US 41 / Bus . M @-@ 28 designation along Bus . M @-@ 28 in Ishpeming and Negaunee . This second designation was removed by 1982 . 
 US 41 in the Copper Country was recognized on September 26 , 1995 , as the state 's first scenic heritage route ( now a Pure Michigan Byway ) . The first section given the designation ran from Central to Copper Harbor . The designation was extended south to Mohawk in 2002 and Houghton in 2004 . On September 22 , 2005 , US 41 north of Houghton was designated the Copper Country Trail of the National Scenic Byways program . This section of the highway was named one of Country magazine 's 10 " Best Scenic Roads in America " in November 2014 . 
 Construction started on November 1 , 2004 , to replace the Interstate Bridge carrying US 41 between Marinette , Wisconsin , and Menominee . The project wrapped up on November 22 , 2005 , when the new bridge opened to traffic . A ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony was held on December 3 , 2005 , to celebrate the replacement of the 1929 structure . In 2011 , MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County to 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) , although truck traffic remains set at 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . 
 = = = Marquette roundabout = = = 
 MDOT unveiled plans on March 31 , 2009 , to rebuild the intersection between Front Street and the eastern end of the Marquette Bypass during 2010 as a roundabout , replacing several intersecting roadways that connect the north and south sections of Front Street with US 41 / M @-@ 28 through the existing intersection . The previous intersection configuration dated back to November 1963 . It had been labeled as " dangerous and [ causing ] significant traffic delays " by the designers of the replacement . A traffic study concluded in 2007 that the intersection would need either the roundabout or a traffic signal with several turning lanes to accommodate the traffic needs in the area . MDOT decided in favor of a two @-@ lane , 150 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 46 m ) roundabout retaining the right @-@ turn lanes from the previous intersection layout . These lanes will be used by right @-@ turning traffic to bypass the circle at the center of the intersection . 
 MDOT engineers touted the constant @-@ flowing nature of the design as a benefit to the new intersection , and city planners promoted the enhanced safety aspects of the project . Both parties stated the planned intersection was less expensive than a conventional stop light . Residents have expressed concerns about snow plowing and truck traffic in the intersection . The designers consulted officials of Avon , Colorado , where several roundabouts are situated in a location that averages over 300 inches ( 760 cm ) of annual snowfall . Designers planned the size of the new intersection to accommodate truck traffic . MDOT has stated that many of the concerns expressed are due to misconceptions and unfounded assumptions about the design . The department held an informational meeting with the residents on April 15 , 2010 before construction began . Topics ranges from emergency vehicles , plowing , trucks , accidents and detour plans . 
 Construction started on the project in May . One lane of traffic in each direction was maintained for US 41 / M @-@ 28 . Motorist seeking access to downtown were detoured via Grove Street or Lakeshore Boulevard . The Downtown Development Authority had plans to purchase billboards helping to direct customers to the downtown shopping district . A section of the intersection was opened in July to traffic from the south that turns west . The lanes northbound into downtown were opened in the beginning of August , and the city held a ribbon cutting ceremony on August 19 , 2010 . The remaining lanes were opened the next day . To address residents ' concerns about truck traffic through the intersection , the mayor noted that a large lumber truck successfully navigated the roundabout after the ribbon was cut . " It just cruised right around and through . All of these people who are wondering is it big enough , can you get a firetruck on it ? Yes , you can , " stated Mayor John Kivela . 
 = = = Keweenaw Bay relocation = = = 
 In 2010 , officials from MDOT announced a $ 2 @.@ 3 million project to move a 1 @.@ 6 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 2 @.@ 6 km ) section of US 41 about 100 feet ( 30 m ) inland along a set of cliffs five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of Baraga . The sandstone cliffs were eroding next to Keweenaw Bay , and a 2007 study from MTU said that action at that time would be needed within a decade . The department had funding available in 2010 and decided to take on the project at the time . Local homes were not affected by the project , although the state had to purchase property to accommodate the shift . A parallel rail line was removed in the project . Rail service from Baraga to <unk> has been suspended for several years , and the right @-@ of @-@ way had been overgrown with brush ; the rails will be replaced if needed in the future . The project was completed in October 2010 . 
 = = Historic bridges = = 
 Seven bridges along the US 41 corridor have been recognized for their historic character by various organizations . Six of the seven are listed on MDOT 's Historic Bridge Inventory ; the seventh not listed by MDOT is on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) and Michigan 's State Register of Historic Sites ( <unk> ) along with four of the others . 
 = = = Portage Lake Lift Bridge = = = 
 The Portage Lake Lift Bridge connects the cities of Hancock and Houghton by crossing over the Portage Waterway , an arm of Portage Lake that cuts across the Keweenaw Peninsula . A canal links the final several miles of the lake arm to Lake Superior to the northwest . 
 This lift bridge features a middle section capable of being raised from a low point of 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) of clearance over the water to a clearance of 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) to allow boats to pass underneath . The Portage Lake Lift Bridge is the widest and heaviest double @-@ decked vertical lift bridge in the world . The lower deck of the span was originally open to rail traffic when it was built in 1959 , but this level is now closed to trains and is used in the winter for snowmobile traffic . 
 The lift bridge is the last of several previous crossings over the waterway . A wooden swing bridge was built in 1875 . A newer , iron swing bridge was built in 1897 ; this structure was partially destroyed in 1905 when it was struck by a ship . This second crossing was rebuilt in 1906 and remained in service until the lift bridge was opened in December 1959 . The current bridge was last used for railroad traffic in the summer of 1982 , after the Soo Line rail lines north of Houghton were abandoned starting in 1976 . The middle section is left in an intermediate position for the warmer nine months of the year so that vehicle traffic can use the lower deck of the lift span and pleasure craft can pass under the bridge . In the winter , the lift span is lowered so snowmobiles and skiers can use the lower deck while cars and trucks use the upper deck . 
 = = = Interstate Bridge = = = 
 The Interstate Bridge was built in 1929 for $ 700 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 2 million in 2015 ) to carry US 41 over the Menominee River at the state line . This span replaced a series of bridges built to connect Marinette , Wisconsin , and Menominee , Michigan , across the river . The first bridge was built in 1865 with a second built in 1872 that was replaced in 1929 with the third bridge . This third crossing was 850 feet ( 259 m ) in length , consisting of eleven 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) spans . The bridge was rehabilitated in 1970 in a project that included widening the deck and replacing the guard rails . Another construction project in 1999 repaired the Michigan side and the slough bridge portion of the Wisconsin side of the structure ; the project closed the bridge for six months . 
 The Interstate Bridge was completely replaced starting on November 1 , 2004 , in a joint project between the MDOT and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation . The 13 @-@ month project was budgeted to cost $ 6 @.@ 45 million ( equivalent to $ 8 @.@ 6 million in 2015 ) . Demolition started in the center of the crossing , sawing the deck into pieces for disposal . This reconstruction was completed ahead of schedule , and the span reopened on November 22 , 2005 . The project completely replaced the bridge above the water line with wider traffic lanes , a new bicycle lane and wider sidewalks . Images of wild rice were sculpted into the concrete because " Menominee " in the local Menominee language means " wild rice " . These sculptures were added to the other decorative elements placed on the new bridge including the railings and light poles . The new Interstate Bridge was dedicated on December 3 , 2005 , in a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony that replicated the 1930 ceremony on the previous crossing . 
 = = = NRHP @-@ listed bridges = = = 
 Five other bridges are listed on the NRHP and the Michigan <unk> as well as on the MDOT Historic Bridge Inventory . The first is in Limestone Township in Alger County . Designated Trunk Line Bridge No. 264 , it carries King Road across the Whitefish River along a former alignment of US 41 built in 1919 . Constructed of two 35 @-@ foot ( 11 m ) through girders , the span continues to carry traffic although it is no longer on a state trunkline highway . 
 Drivers cannot use the Peshekee River Bridge south of US 41 / M @-@ 28 in western Marquette County 's Michigamme Township . The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 for its engineering and architectural significance . MDOT has listed it on their Historic Bridge Inventory as " one of Michigan 's most important vehicular bridges " . It was the first bridge designed by the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) , the forerunner to MDOT , in 1914 . As the first crossing , it was designated " Trunk Line Bridge No. 1 " and served as the prototype for hundreds of similar concrete through @-@ girder bridges built in the state before the design fell out of favor in 1930 . It was bypassed by a new structure built over the Peshekee River for US 41 / M @-@ 28 and subsequently abandoned as a roadway , deteriorating in a county park . 
 Another abandoned bridge is now privately owned and in use at the mouth of the Backwater Creek on the Keweenaw Bay near L 'Anse . The span was constructed in 1918 for $ 4 @,@ 536 ( equivalent to $ 345 @,@ 451 in 2015 ) . It is an 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) Warren truss design now situated on private property . This abandoned bridge was listed on the National Register in 1999 . 
 One bridge still in use crosses the Sturgeon River in Baraga County , known locally as the Canyon Falls Bridge . The structure was completed in 1948 as a steel arch bridge to span the river near the falls as part of a reconstruction project of US 41 between Ishpeming and L 'Anse . The crossing has a main span of 128 feet ( 39 m ) flanked by two 52 @-@ foot ( 16 m ) approach spans . 
 The last historic bridge on US 41 is located near the northern terminus east of Copper Harbor . The Fanny Hooe Creek crossing was listed on the NRHP in 1999 , but as of 2012 , MDOT has not included the structure on its inventory of historic bridges online . The creek crossing is just west of the Fort Wilkins State entrance . MSHD and the Keweenaw County Road Commission designed and built the span in 1927 – 28 for $ 8 @,@ 132 ( equivalent to $ 556 @,@ 003 in 2015 ) . The bridge is unique for its stonework decoration on the 25 @-@ foot ( 8 m ) span over the creek . This stonework includes <unk> not usually associated with Michigan highway bridges . The crossing has remained in service since construction without alteration . 
 = = Memorial designations = = 
 Seven memorial designations have been applied to sections of US 41 . Some of these designations follow other highways that run concurrently with US 41 . Most of the designations are no longer in use , but the Jacobetti and Veterans memorial highways still have signage posted on the side of the road . 
 The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau . A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle Tours years later , the route followed " ... a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ... " This route followed the modern US 41 from the M @-@ 28 junction in Harvey to Copper Harbor . A branch of the route followed US 2 / US 41 between Powers and Rapid River . The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan ; the side trips to Lake Superior distracted from this mission . 
 Sheridan Road was created in the early 20th century connecting Chicago with Fort Sheridan north of the city . Both the road and the fort were named in honor of Philip Sheridan , Union general during the Civil War . Sheridan , who served as colonel of the 2nd Michigan Cavalry in 1862 , was later promoted to the rank of major general during the war . The Greater Sheridan Road Association started to promote an extension of the road south to St. Louis and north through Wisconsin and Michigan to end at Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor by 1922 . The roadway followed US 41 's predecessor , M @-@ 15 , and included numerous road signs bearing Sheridan 's silhouette mounted on his horse Rienzi . Towns along the way were encouraged to rename city streets as Sheridan Road on Labor Day 1923 . The road was promoted until the Great Depression in the 1930s . All that remains are signs in Menominee noting that First Street was once Sheridan Road . 
 The Townsend National Highway was named for Charles E. Townsend , a former congressman and senator from Michigan . As a senator , he introduced the federal highway aid bill in 1919 . The Michigan Good Roads Association promoted a highway in his name between Mobile , Alabama , and Michigan . The Michigan segment followed a number of highways through the two peninsulas , including the modern US 41 between Harvey and Calumet . Only Townsend Drive in Houghton retains the name in part . 
 Memory Lane was created in 1947 along US 41 in Baraga . The local Lions Club planted over 100 red maple trees at the recommendation of a state highway department forester to honor the veterans of World War I and World War II . 
 The <unk> Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of US 2 / US 41 / M @-@ 35 between the northern Escanaba city limits and CR 426 in Delta County . The American Veterans ( <unk> ) organization in Michigan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation which was granted under Public Act 144 in 1959 . 
 The D. J. Jacobetti Memorial Highway follows the segment of US 41 concurrent with M @-@ 28 between Harvey and the Ishpeming – Negaunee city limits in Marquette County . The designation was created in 1986 and continues east along M @-@ 28 to honor the longest serving member of the Michigan Legislature , elected to a record 21 terms before his death in 1994 . 
 A section of US 41 is one of six unrelated Veterans Memorial Highway designations in Michigan . The Upper Peninsula designation follows the western end of M @-@ 28 , including the section of US 41 between Ishpeming and Covington . This memorial was created in Public Act 10 of 2003 and dedicated on Memorial Day in 2004 . 
 = = Business loops = = 
 There have been three business loops for US 41 : Ishpeming – Negaunee , Marquette and Baraga . Only the business loop serving Ishpeming and Negaunee is still a state @-@ maintained trunkline , but it is no longer designated Bus . US 41 . US 41 / M @-@ 28 was relocated to bypass the two cities ' downtowns in 1937 . The highway through downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee later carried the ALT US 41 / ALT M @-@ 28 designation before being designated Bus . M @-@ 28 in 1958 . The western end of the business loop was transferred to local government control when Bus . M @-@ 28 was moved along Lakeshore Drive in 1999 . 
 Bus . US 41 in Marquette was first shown on a map in 1964 after the construction of the Marquette Bypass . It was later designated Bus . US 41 / Bus . M @-@ 28 on a map in 1975 ; this second designation was removed from maps by 1982 . The entire business loop was turned back to local control in a " route swap " between the City of Marquette and MDOT announced in early 2005 . The proposal transferred jurisdiction on the unsigned M @-@ 554 and the business route from the state to the city . The state would take jurisdiction over a segment of McClellan Avenue to be used to extend M @-@ 553 to US 41 / M @-@ 28 . In addition , MDOT would pay $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 3 @.@ 2 million in 2015 ) for reconstruction work planned for 2007 . The transfer would increase Marquette 's operational and maintenance liability expenses by $ 26 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 32 @,@ 781 in 2015 ) and place the financial burden of the future replacement of a stop light on the city . On October 10 , 2005 , MDOT and Marquette transferred jurisdiction over the three roadways . As a result , Bus . US 41 was decommissioned when the local government took control over Washington and Front streets . As a result of the decommissioning , the 2006 maps did not show the former business loop . 
 The third business loop was in Baraga in the early 1940s . As shown on the maps of the time , US 41 was relocated in Baraga between the publication of the December 1 , 1939 , and the April 15 , 1940 , MSHD maps . A business loop followed the old routing through downtown . The last map that shows the loop was published on July 1 , 1941 . Bus . US 41 is shown under local control on the June 15 , 1942 , map .

 = Representative democracy in Singapore = 
 Singapore has a multi @-@ party parliamentary system of representative democracy in which the President of Singapore is the head of state and the Prime Minister of Singapore is the head of government . Executive power is vested in the President and the Cabinet . Cabinet has the general direction and control of the government and is collectively responsible to the Parliament . There are three separate branches of government : the legislature , executive and judiciary . 
 Representative democracy began in the 1940s when the number of elected seats in the legislature gradually increased , until a fully elected Legislative Assembly of Singapore was established in 1958 . At present , Singapore legislation establishes various mechanisms that fulfil the doctrine of representative democracy . Parliamentary elections in Singapore are required to be held regularly to elect the Parliament through universal suffrage . Although the right to vote in Singapore law is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution , the Government has affirmed that the right may be implied into the constitutional text . 
 The Constitution vests the three branches of the state with different aspects of governmental power . The executive is made up of the President and the Cabinet , which is headed by the Prime Minister . The Cabinet is accountable to the electorate and is an embodiment of representative democracy . The President is elected by the people to act as a constitutional safeguard in protecting the national reserves and preserving the integrity of the public service . To qualify as a presidential candidate , stringent criteria must be satisfied . 
 The Constitution further provides for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament ( MPs ) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies , Non @-@ constituency Members of Parliament ( NCMPs ) and Nominated Members of Parliament ( NMPs ) . MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have . The Government 's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system . While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation of the concept of representative democracy , it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution , such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV . 
 The right to freedom of speech and expression , which is guaranteed to Singapore citizens by Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore , is essential to the concept of representative democracy . Mechanisms available for the exercise of the right include the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament , Speakers ' Corner , and the new media . However , Article 14 enables Parliament to restrict the right to free speech on various grounds . One of these is the protection of reputation . Critics have charged that Cabinet ministers and members of the ruling People 's Action Party have used civil defamation suits against opposition politicians to inhibit their activities and exclude them from Parliament . The Government has said that there is no evidence substantiating such claims . In addition , both media ownership and content are carefully regulated by the Government . Article 14 protects the right to freedom of assembly which is relevant to free speech as the latter is often exercised at assemblies and gatherings . Free assembly is restricted in Singapore through laws that require permits to be obtained before events are held , though an exception is made for indoor events involving organizers and speakers who are citizens . 
 The Government has been accused of slowing down the progress of democracy by using the Internal Security Act ( Cap . 143 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) to detain political opponents and suppress political criticism . In response , the Government has asserted that no person has been detained purely for their political beliefs . 
 = = Government 's understanding of representative democracy = = 
 Representative democracy has been described as " a system of government where the people in free elections elect [ ] their representatives to the legislative chamber which occupies the most powerful position in the political system " . The meaning of the term was discussed in the Parliament of Singapore on 27 August 2008 upon a motion moved by Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li @-@ ann , a professor of constitutional law at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law , for the House to affirm the importance of representative democracy and to call on the Government to amend the Parliamentary Elections Act to make the calling of by @-@ elections mandatory in Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) in certain situations . According to Thio , under the view of representative democracy taken by the 18th @-@ century British Member of Parliament ( MP ) and philosopher Edmund Burke , " an MP is no mere delegate who simply mouths his constituents ' views . An MP is chosen for his ' mature judgment ' and ' enlightened conscience . ' " Thus , an MP " has to represent his constituents in tending to municipal affairs " , but also " be concerned with national affairs " , and , " as a party member , he must toe the party line " . In addition , an MP of a minority ethnic group in a GRC " has to carry the concerns of his particular minority community as well " . For this reason , she felt that if the seat of a minority MP in a GRC became vacant , it should be incumbent on the Government to call a by @-@ election to fill it . 
 Opposing the motion , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that the Burkean model of representative democracy " puts the emphasis on choosing candidates to become MPs as the fundamental element of the whole scheme " , with the result that " if an MP dies or resigns , ... he has to be replaced , so a by @-@ election has to be held promptly without delay " . However , in the Government 's view , representative democracy is better understood as having an " emphasis on choosing political parties to form the government and to have political parties as the fundamental element in the system " : 
 Parties will field candidates to contest in general elections . They have to be high quality people – with integrity , ability , commitment , drive – all the attributes which we look for in an ideal candidate . But the candidate is not on his own . He carries the banner of the party . ... [ H ] e identifies himself for the party 's manifesto , the programmes and the promises that the party makes . ... In this scheme , if voters in the general election support the party and vote its candidates in , and they form a majority in Parliament , then that party with a majority in Parliament forms the government . And that party has a mandate , not only because it so happens that this specific group of MPs , at this moment , supports it , but because it stood in a general election and the voters gave it the mandate , and indirectly , through the MP , voted for this party to form the government of the country , and to govern the country until the next general elections are called . Therefore , the emphasis in this system is on the ruling Party delivering on its programmes and promises . 
 Consequently , if a parliamentary seat falls vacant mid @-@ term , it does not have to be filled immediately as " [ t ] he vacancy does not affect the mandate of the Government , nor its ability to deliver on its programmes or promises . And this mandate continues until the next general election is called , when the incumbent team will render account to the electorate . " The Prime Minister said that the Singapore system of government was based on this model for two reasons : first , to " encourage voters to think very carefully when they are voting during general elections , because you are not only voting for your representative in the constituency , you are voting for the government in the country " ; and , secondly , " to maximise the chances of a stable , effective government in between general elections " . 
 = = History = = 
 Singapore was colonized by the British in the 19th century , during which society was ruled according to English law . The result was the transplantation of the Western idea of representative democracy into Singapore 's legal system . This idea has taken root and developed tremendously since the end of World War II into what it is today . 
 = = = Before World War II = = = 
 After Singapore was founded in 1819 , she was under the jurisdiction of British rule . For a long time , representative democracy was non @-@ existent . In 1920 , a select committee which was established to reform the Legislative Council argued that Singapore was not ready for democratic ideas – to allow people to elect members into the Legislative Council might result in giving the " professional politician the opportunity of obtaining power by playing on religious and social prejudices " . Even though the Council lacked popular representation of the locals , the population was generally satisfied with the system and the policies of the Governor of the Straits Settlements were influenced by opinions expressed by the public and in the press . 
 = = = After World War II = = = 
 It was only in 1946 , after the Japanese Occupation and the disbanding of the Straits Settlements , that the people were allowed to elect members into the Legislative Council . The Council then consisted of at least 22 but not more than 24 members . Only nine members were elected , out of which the Singapore Chamber of Commerce , the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce were each allotted one seat . The other six seats were to be filled by democratic elections based on universal suffrage . Elections were held for the first time on 20 March 1948 . 
 Even so , the general public was apathetic towards the new political situation and the British regarded this as the major impediment to the development of democratic government in Singapore . Thus , a constitutional commission headed by Sir George Rendel was set up in 1953 to recommend changes in the constitutional system , with the aim of increasing widespread participation in the central and local government of Singapore . 
 The Government accepted most of the Rendel Commission 's recommendations in its report of February 1954 . One suggested reform was to transform the Legislative Council into an Assembly of 32 members , of whom 25 would be elected . The " Leader of the House " or " Chief Minister " would be the leader of the largest political party in the Assembly or of a coalition of parties assured of majority support . Representation by the Chambers of Commerce was also removed . 
 The amended Constitution of Singapore also provided for a Council of Ministers appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the Chief Minister , consisting of three unelected Official Members and six Elected Members . As the Constitution was unclear on the powers of the ministers , the discretion to make crucial decisions and formulate policies was understood to reside in the Governor and the Official Members . 
 = = = Self @-@ governance , merger with Malaysia , and independence = = = 
 A fully elected Legislative Assembly was finally established in 1958 , when Singapore relinquished its colonial status to become a self @-@ governing state . Its powers extended to areas not previously under its purview , such as defence and foreign policy . This situation remained throughout merger with Malaysia in 1963 , and after separation from Malaysia and full independence in 1965 . In the Proclamation of Singapore contained in the Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965 entered into between Malaysia and Singapore , Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed on behalf of the people and Government of Singapore that as from 9 August 1965 Singapore " shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent nation , founded upon the principles of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of her people in a more just and equal society " . 
 After independence , the Parliament of Singapore remained fully elected until 1984 , when amendments to the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non @-@ constituency Members of Parliament ( " NCMPs " ) . NCMPs , who are declared elected by the returning officer , consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast . The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament . In 1990 , yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ( " NMP " ) . These non @-@ partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament . 
 = = Voting = = 
 = = = Role in a representative democracy = = = 
 Voting is regarded as key to representative democracy , which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people . The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights . Every person , therefore , has a right to one vote , and no more , in the choice of representatives . The right to vote is a primary right , a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected . It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard , the ballot box is the people 's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies . However , it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy ; rather , it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self @-@ governance . 
 = = = Right to vote = = = 
 The right to vote in Singapore is an implied constitutional right arising from various provisions in the Constitution . These include Articles 65 and 66 , which provide for a maximum term of five years for each Parliament and for a general election to be held within three months after Parliament is dissolved . In a parliamentary debate in 2009 , NMP Thio Li @-@ ann suggested that the Government should amend the Constitution to expressly include a right to vote . She said : 
 A right of fundamental importance should be recognised as a fundamental right and constitutionally entrenched . Only the most important rights and interests are <unk> ... The right to vote is not an ancillary or new @-@ fangled right ; it is fundamental and long @-@ established . 
 Thio noted that in 1966 the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission had considered it " necessary and wise " to constitutionally entrench the right to vote by making it removable only by a majority of two @-@ thirds of the electorate voting at a national referendum . In addition , she cited the case of Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor ( 1988 ) , where the High Court had made a statement which seemed to indicate that the right to vote is a privilege rather than a right . In reply , Minister for Law K. Shanmugam affirmed that the right to vote is indeed a constitutional right . He noted that it cannot be a privilege in a representative democracy since that would imply that there exists an institution superior to the body of citizens which can grant such a privilege . He also asserted that , ultimately , " it is the mettle of the people and its leadership " that determine whether the Constitution is abided by as the supreme law of the land . 
 In response to Thio 's point on the views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission , Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature and unfamiliar with the importance of voting , a result of the country 's history of colonial rule . In contrast , the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point . With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case , Shanmugam stated that since the Court 's observations were obiter , they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent . 
 = = = First @-@ past @-@ the @-@ post system = = = 
 The " first @-@ past @-@ the @-@ post " voting system , also known as the simple plurality voting system , is used in Singapore for electing the President as well as Members of the Parliament . This system has been criticized as undemocratic because the eventual winner may have won only a minority of the total votes cast , despite having secured the most number of votes in absolute terms among all the candidates . Thus , there might be cases where an elected politician can be said to have won the mandate of only a minority of voters , and that his or her election is therefore not an accurate reflection of the voters ' will . As constitutional lawyer Sir William Wade has said : " If it is accepted that a democratic Parliament ought to represent so far as possible the preferences of the voters , this system is probably the worst that could be devised . " 
 In the 2006 general election , despite only achieving 66 @.@ 6 % of the total votes cast , the ruling People 's Action Party ( " PAP " ) was returned to power with 82 out of the 84 seats . While there were more opposition members elected to the Parliament in the 2011 general election , PAP held on to 81 of 87 seats in the Parliament despite securing only 60 @.@ 1 % of the votes . Also , during the 2011 presidential election , President Tony Tan Keng Yam won with only 35 @.@ 2 % of the total votes . 
 = = = Eligibility to vote = = = 
 Voting in Singapore is compulsory . Any citizen above 21 years of age who is not disqualified by the factors in section 6 of the Parliamentary Elections Act is required to vote in person . There is no constitutional provision stipulating any qualifications for voters , and as the Act is an ordinary piece of legislation the disqualifying factors may be changed by a simple majority ( more than 50 % ) of votes in Parliament . 
 To be eligible to vote at a contested election in any constituency , a voter 's name must be on the latest certified register of electors for that constituency . The name of the voter will be included in the register of electors for a constituency if on the cut @-@ off date for the production of the register of electors the voter is a citizen of Singapore , at least 21 years old , and ordinarily resident or deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore at an address that is in that constituency . For the purpose of preparing or revising a register of electors , information stated on a voter 's National Registration Identity Card is used to determine that he or she complies with the above requirements , unless the facts are shown to be otherwise . 
 = = Democratic institutions = = 
 = = = Legislature = = = 
 The Legislature of Singapore consists of the President and the Parliament . The concept of representative democracy is embodied in the Legislature and is given effect in part through various parliamentary innovations that have been introduced over the years , such as Group Representation Constituencies , Non @-@ constituency Members of Parliament and Nominated Members of Parliament . 
 = = = = Constituencies = = = = 
 There are two types of constituencies ( electoral divisions ) in Singapore : Single Member Constituencies ( SMCs ) and Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) . In SMCs candidates vie individually for parliamentary seats , whereas in GRCs the contest is between teams of candidates . Under the GRC scheme , which came into effect on 1 June 1988 , the Government may , having regard to the number of voters in a particular constituency , advise the President to declare it to be a GRC and designate it as a constituency in which at least one of the candidates is from the Malay community , or from the Indian or some other minority community in Singapore . Each team in a GRC may have between three and six candidates . 
 The GRC scheme seeks to ensure a multiracial Parliament and seeks to secure " the long @-@ term political stability of Singapore ... by ensuring that Parliament will always be multi @-@ racial and representative of our society , and ... by encouraging the practice of multi @-@ racial politics by all political parties " . It also encourages political parties to appeal to all races with moderate policies , and not to one race or another with chauvinist or extremist policies . Further , it has been suggested that the scheme puts a " premium on parties which can field credible teams " , thereby demonstrating that they are " fit not just to become MPs but to form the government " . 
 The GRC scheme has been criticized as weakening the candidate – voter relationship , because it may be more difficult for voters to feel that candidates actually represent them when there are a number of candidates in a team to vote for . Most voters elect MPs whom they can identify with and are better able to represent their interests . It would be much easier for voters to identify with a single candidate than with a team of , say , four individuals . Also , since there will be key vote pullers in every GRC , the unknown or unpopular candidate is " dragged into Parliament on the coat @-@ tails of the major vote @-@ puller " . This alienates the electorate from its representatives , thereby undermining the idea of representation . Since the people " cannot clearly identify themselves with the candidates ... responsibility for choices cannot be ascribed to the people " . 
 In addition , it has been suggested that the GRC scheme merely provides an appearance of a united , multiracial Parliament . In fact , minority representatives are required to vote according to their party line ; they are not allowed to vote specifically in the interests of their racial groups . The multiracial element in Parliament has been artificially imposed by way of a racial quota to ensure that the minorities are represented . 
 = = = = Non @-@ constituency Members of Parliament = = = = 
 The NCMP Scheme was introduced in 1984 to ensure the presence of Opposition Members in Parliament . The NCMP Scheme serves to ensure that the voices of the minority are still heard . Thus , to qualify as an NCMP , the candidate must have won at least 15 % of the total number of votes . The powers of an NCMP are restricted in Art 39 ( 2 ) of the Constitution : an NCMP cannot vote on a bill to amend the Constitution ; a supply , supplementary supply or final supply bill ; a money bill ; a vote of no confidence in the Government ; or a motion for removing the President from office . 
 Despite the aim of the NCMP scheme to ameliorate the impacts of the first @-@ past @-@ the @-@ post system , its legitimacy is highly doubted . It is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs , nor on expertise or specialization ( as in the case of NMPs ) . As a result , the privileges of NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative voices in Parliament . 
 Further , critics question the exact purpose of the scheme . It is unclear as to whether NCMPs serve to represent the minority in the first @-@ past @-@ the post system , or is an apparent representation that would not affect PAP 's decision @-@ making . Nevertheless , it still seems to be a mechanism for representation of the minority opposition . 
 = = = = Nominated Members of Parliament = = = = 
 The NMP scheme was introduced in 1990 and serves to introduce into Parliament alternative , independent and non @-@ partisan views from minorities and experts . This is said to effectively raises the level of political discourse . Women , for example , who are usually under @-@ represented in parliament , may be appointed as an NMP to provide alternate views . A special select committee of Parliament nominates candidates to be appointed as NMPs by the President on the advice of the Cabinet . In 2010 , the number of NMPs was increased from six to nine . NMPs share the same powers and privileges as NCMPs . 
 The NMP scheme was not introduced without controversy , which may lead one to question the effectiveness of the scheme in strengthening representative democracy . Despite the protests of many PAP MPs , the party whip was enforced to effect the passing of this scheme . Criticism of the scheme mainly revolved around the dilution of the democratic legitimacy of the Parliament since the electorate has no say in choosing the NMP based on his or her merits . Further , there may be doubts as to the NMP 's commitment and willingness to serve as an MP , since the NMP bypasses the electoral process . The scheme has also given rise to allegations that it serves as another platform for the PAP to undercut support for the opposition . 
 On the other hand , NMP Paulin Tay <unk> has argued that NMPs , being non @-@ partisan , do not replace either PAP or opposition MPs . During general elections , Singaporeans still continue to elect MPs who best represent their interests , and NMPs do not feature in the equation . In other words , the NMP scheme has never compromised the democratic process of free elections . 
 = = = = By @-@ elections = = = = 
 A by @-@ election is an election held in between general elections to fill a vacant parliamentary seat . Article 49 of the Constitution states that a vacancy not due to a dissolution of Parliament " shall be filled by election in the manner provided by or under any law relating to the Parliamentary elections " . However , when a vacancy arises in a GRC , no election needs to be held unless all the MPs have vacated their seats . The Prime Minister has full discretion with regards to the timing of the by @-@ election and he is not obliged to call a by @-@ election within any fixed timeline . 
 Whether a timeframe should be imposed for the calling of by @-@ elections has been subject to much debate . Several arguments have been advanced by the Government . First , when a voter casts a vote for a candidate , he is also voting for the political party that the candidate is a member of . Thus , once the party has received the voter 's mandate , a vacant seat will not affect this mandate . Requiring the other members in a GRC to vacate their seats so that a by @-@ election can be called would be unfair to them . Secondly , the Government believes that a GRC can function if it is lacking a member , as MPs from other constituencies can help to address the needs of residents in that GRC . 
 However , Thio Li @-@ ann believes that it is undesirable that the law does not impose a timeframe for the calling of by @-@ elections . If a by @-@ election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant , the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent . This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate . Should the latter situation arise , the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated . 
 In an SMC , only one candidate is elected to represent the constituency in question . Thus , if an SMC parliamentary seat is vacated and the Prime Minister exercises discretion not to call a by @-@ election in the SMC , the constituency 's residents will not only lack a representative in Parliament but will also be without a Town Council chairman . 
 Finally , where an MP of the ruling party vacates his or her seat , a counterpart in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions , thus eliminating the need for a by @-@ election . However , this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by @-@ election is called , because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament . Therefore , the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election . 
 = = = Elected President = = = 
 Singapore 's Elected Presidency scheme was created as a constitutional safeguard for the nation 's future to prevent irresponsible governance . Being directly elected by the people gives the President legitimacy and moral authority to serve as a check on the executive 's powers . The President 's two main responsibilities are the protection of Singapore 's past reserves and the preservation of the integrity of the public service . However , the President 's role is custodial and ceremonial – he does not exercise executive powers . In fact , the President is generally required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet , or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet , in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution or any other written law , unless the contrary is expressly provided for . 
 = = = = <unk> eligibility requirements and the Presidential Elections Committee 's role = = = = 
 Thio Li @-@ ann has said that the democratic character of the process for electing the President may be hampered by the application of stringent , elitist criteria , such that it becomes a " clear obstacle to the unmediated expression of the citizens ' preferences " . 
 Imposing more stringent criteria for the President than for the Prime Minister appears unreasonable , considering how the Prime Minister 's governing powers are far more substantial than that of the President . Among other things , candidates have to be above 45 years of age and must either presently hold or in the past have held high public office or directorships in private sector companies with paid @-@ up capitals of at least S $ 100 million . It has been estimated that " only just over 400 people have the necessary financial or administrative experience to qualify as spelt out in the constitution " . These onerous qualifying criteria have greatly reduced the pool of candidates , and have been criticized as " technocratic rather than democratic " . 
 In response to the criticisms , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong argued that the qualification process is necessary and was " carefully designed to ensure that the electorate is presented with qualified candidates " . The Prime Minister asserted it would be " reckless " to adopt less stringent criteria , though such criteria can be " refined further over time " . 
 Potential presidential candidates are vetted by an unelected three @-@ member Presidential Elections Committee ( " PEC " ) . The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny a certificate of eligibility . Its decision is not subject to legal or political scrutiny , and its verdict is final . There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan , who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election , was denied a certificate of eligibility . Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter , he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character . Subsequently , Kuan was denied a certificate , the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation 's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to the experience of a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid @-@ up capital of at least $ 100 million , as required by the Constitution . There is no legal requirement for the PEC to interview prospective candidates , and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain his side of the story . As a result , the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term . 
 Possible reforms might be for prospective candidates to have the right to publicly respond to negative accusations before the PEC , and for the PEC to be more transparent with regard to the reasons for their decisions concerning the eligibility of candidates . A more democratized process open to public scrutiny would give citizens a role to play , thus enhancing the notion of representative democracy . 
 = = = = <unk> elections = = = = 
 After Ong Teng Cheong , the first Elected President , had stepped down , the subsequent presidential elections in 1999 and 2005 were uncontested , and S.R. Nathan was deemed to have been elected unopposed for two consecutive terms . Thio has commented : 
 The right to vote in competitive elections is integral to a functioning democracy and its underlying principles of representation , participation , and legitimacy . Unfortunately , the phenomenon of election by default , a regular feature of Singapore 's parliamentary and presidential elections , only harms the practice of democracy . 
 She has suggested that to ensure that the institution of the Elected President continues to be legitimate , even if there is only one candidate in an election a vote should be held , and the candidate only declared elected if he or she receives at least a specified percentage of votes . 
 = = = Prime Minister and the Cabinet = = = 
 Singapore 's Prime Minister is the Head of the Government of Singapore . The President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who , in his judgment , is likely to command the confidence of a majority of the MPs . This is a power that the President exercises in his personal discretion . The President then acts in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister to appoint other Ministers from among the Members of Parliament . These Ministers , together with the Prime Minister , form the Cabinet . The Cabinet has the general direction and control of the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament . 
 This scheme can be seen as a mechanism for representation . First , MPs are chosen by the electorate to represent their concerns and needs in Parliament . Secondly , the Prime Minister , who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs , and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs , effectively represent the views of the electorate as he heads the Government . The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation . 
 = = Role of the judiciary = = 
 = = = Appointment and independence of judges = = = 
 Article 93 of the Constitution vests judicial power in the judiciary . Rather than being elected , the Chief Justice , Judges of Appeal , and the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President if he , acting in his discretion , concurs with the advice of the Prime Minister . In the Subordinate Courts , district judges and magistrates are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Chief Justice . The idea of the rule of the majority means that people should only be governed by laws passed by their elected representatives . Thus , unelected judges influencing the laws that govern people through the making of decisions seems incompatible with the idea of representative democracy . It has also been said that a judicial " last word " would put the judiciary at odds with Parliament , as the judiciary is not directly accountable to the people . However , even though the appointment of judges is counter @-@ majoritarian in nature , this does not mean that the concept of representative democracy is undermined , as it appears that a counter @-@ majoritarian judiciary more effectively upholds the Constitution and the concept of representative democracy . 
 Because of this vital responsibility that the judiciary has , it is important that the judiciary is independent of the political branches of government . As Alexander Hamilton put it : " The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution " . Singapore 's judiciary , however , has been criticized as lacking independence and impartiality . 
 According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers , the criticisms involving judicial bias " could have stemmed from the very high number of cases won by the government or members of the ruling party in either contempt or defamation suits brought against government critics , whether media or individual " . The Government is alleged to have used the judiciary as a tool to deluge their political opponents like J.B. Jeyaretnam , Tang Liang Hong and Dr. Chee Soon Juan with litigation , in some cases causing bankruptcy and , eventually , removal from the political scene . In a 2008 report , the International Bar Association Human Rights Institute ( " <unk> " ) claimed that the " slim likelihood " of a successful defence to defamation , combined with high damages awarded in cases involving PAP officials , " sheds doubt on the independence of the judiciary in these cases " . 
 Allegations of this nature have previously been denied in parliamentary debates , and the Ministry of Law has said the <unk> 's allegation that there are reasons to worry about the executive 's influence over judicial decision @-@ making is not supported by evidence . In 2000 , Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew noted that " [ o ] ur judiciary and the rule of law are rated by <unk> [ World Economic Forum ] , IMD [ International Institute for Management Development ] and <unk> [ Political and Economic Risk Consultancy ] as the best in Asia " . 
 = = = Upholding the Constitution = = = 
 The Constitution embodies the idea of representative democracy , as it provides for alternative voices and minority representation in Parliament through the GRC , NCMP and NMP schemes . The Chief Justice of Canada , Beverley McLachlin , has commented that democracy itself is a lot more complicated than elected persons making law . Democracy not only requires majority rule , but rule that protects individuals and groups of individuals whilst promoting fairness . As Martin Taylor puts it : 
 As our understanding of the nature of modern democratic government improves , it becomes increasingly apparent that majority rule , while an essential ingredient of the system , can operate in ways which are as undemocratic as the rule of the minority – that democracy has to do not only with who exercises the power of the state , by and for the people , but also with the manner in which the state treats those who seek its assistance , or are obliged to submit to its authority , and with what the state allows people to decide and do of , by and for themselves . 
 " Majority rule " must be subject to limits , as an elected government may still pass or be tempted to pass unconstitutional and undemocratic laws , such as laws affecting fundamental liberties guaranteed by constitutions . 
 The Singapore Constitution provides safeguards against such behaviour by the majority , and prescribes limits to their powers in the form of , among other things , the fundamental liberties in Part IV of the document . The courts have asserted that the judiciary thus has the power and duty to ensure the observance of constitutional provisions , and is also responsible for declaring invalid any exercise of legislative power exceeding the limits conferred by the Constitution , or contravening any prohibition that the Constitution provides . Supreme Court judges take an oath to defend and protect the Constitution before assuming office . This is done through judicial review , where the judiciary prevents the Parliament from enforcing unconstitutional laws by striking down such laws . Thus , the judiciary essentially upholds the idea of representative democracy that the Constitution embodies when playing its counter @-@ majoritarian role of serving as a check on Parliament and a " Protector of the Individual " . 
 = = = <unk> interpretation of statutes = = = 
 A key idea of democracy is that " people may consent to be governed by laws made by ... democratically elected representatives " . Judges are required to interpret statutes in a manner that gives " effect to the intent and will of Parliament " . By interpreting statutes according to Parliament 's intention , the judiciary upholds the notion of representative democracy as it makes sure that the people are ruled accurately by the laws made by their elected leaders . Thus , the role of judges in interpretation is essential to democracy . 
 Judges are required to interpret laws in the light of section 9A ( 1 ) of the Interpretation Act , which requires an interpretation that would " promote the purpose or object " underlying written law is to be " preferred " over an interpretation that would not , thus mandating a purposive interpretation . The Interpretation Act provides for the types of extrinsic materials and the circumstances under which such extrinsic materials can be referred to , to aid judges in determining the purpose of the statute . Thus , when determining the purpose of a statutory provision , a judge can refer to relevant extrinsic materials such as the explanatory statement relating to the bill in which the provision appears and the speech made in Parliament by a minister moving a motion for the second reading of the bill , when circumstances call for it . 
 The view has been taken that judges may assign meaning to vague constitutional provisions or statutes on the basis of their own ideological preferences , hence disregarding Parliament 's intention . This criticism arguably does not suggest the need to abandon interpretation by reference to the legislature 's intention , but serves to highlight the importance of the need to use the power of interpretation in an appropriate manner . 
 = = Freedom of speech and expression = = 
 Democracy essentially means rule of the people . To build a democratic society and rule , there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate . The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial for the formation of public opinion on political questions , and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth . In Singapore , the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Constitution , though it is subject to many qualifications . Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore , friendly relations with other countries , public order or morality , and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence . 
 = = = Role in a representative democracy = = = 
 Upholding the concept of representative democracy requires the protection of freedom of expression . This paves the way for discussion of the state of affairs in the country , as expressed by representatives of the people , which include members of the ruling party elected into government as well as opposition politicians . Free discourse about political ideas and government plans can facilitate the acknowledgement of current weaknesses or limitations . This is justified in the name of public interest as the legislature , administration and governmental institutions will then strive to make improvements . 
 Restricting speech inevitably prevents ascertainment and publication of true facts and accurate judgments – it entails an unwarranted " assumption of infallibility " on the part of the government . As argued by John Stuart Mill and analysed by Eric <unk> , allowing freedom of speech ensures that the government 's policies are right and appropriate to legislate ; even the possibility of false speech should not prevent genuine expression of true beliefs . Nevertheless , since inflammatory speech that may provoke disorder must be prevented , a government should be entitled to prioritize public order considerations over permitting individuals to express their personal opinions . Balancing the risk of damage and disorder against long @-@ term benefits of uninhibited debate is imperative . 
 = = = Government 's position = = = 
 As society matures , the Singapore Government has taken greater cognizance of educated and informed Singaporeans who place greater value on their rights of expression and call for a less restrictive culture . In 2004 , Lee Hsien Loong , then Deputy Prime Minister , expressed how the Government would be " increasingly guided by the consensus of views in the community with regards to morality and decency issues " in a bid to " pull back from being all things to all citizens " . However , he emphasized the caveat of " opening up more choices for citizens , without imposing on the whole of society " . Civic participation may be engaged through debates on policies and national issues , but criticism which " scores political points and undermines the government 's standing , whether or not this is intended " will not be treated lightly . When the opposition criticizes an action or policy , the Government " necessarily has to rebut or even demolish them , so not to lose its moral authority " . 
 In a parliamentary speech on 28 February 2008 , Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said that the Government had adjusted its policies in relation to various types of expression . For instance , in 2000 it had created Speakers ' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches . Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions . All public talks held indoors involving organizers and speakers who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act . However , freedom of speech and expression , though characteristic and imperative in a self @-@ professed democracy , is not unfettered . The Government thus continues to require licences for events where the speeches relate to race or religion , and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held . 
 = = = Mechanisms for the exercise of free speech = = = 
 = = = = Freedom of speech and debate in Parliament = = = = 
 The most direct way of upholding representative democracy is for elected MPs to highlight and address the concerns of the electorate during Parliament sessions . Opposition MPs , NCMPs and NMPs fulfil the important role of representing diverse views and enunciating various needs to the Parliament . At the general election in May 2011 , six opposition MPs from the Workers ' Party of Singapore were elected to Parliament . In section 5 of the Parliament ( Privileges , Immunities and Powers ) Act , enacted pursuant to Article 63 of the Constitution , the freedom of MPs to speak and express themselves in Parliament is provided for in the following terms : 
 There shall be freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in Parliament , and such freedom of speech and debate and proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court , commission of inquiry , committee of inquiry , tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of Parliament . 
 Parliamentary privilege protects contentious views expressed by MPs in the course of parliamentary proceedings in the interest of their constituents or the general public , and thus effectively buoys the right of free speech and expression . Members can speak freely and express themselves frankly in Parliament without fearing legal consequences because they are immune from any civil or criminal proceedings , arrest , imprisonment or damages for what they have said . 
 = = = = Speakers ' Corner = = = = 
 Speakers ' Corner at Hong Lim Park , which was introduced on 1 September 2000 , is a platform for the expression of views in an open @-@ air venue , and was intended to " liberalise our society , to widen the space for expression and participation " , as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong stated in his National Day Rally speech in 2008 . Most assemblies , demonstrations , exhibitions and speeches organized by Singapore citizens and participated in by only citizens and permanent residents may be held at Speakers ' Corner without the need for any permit under either the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act or the Public Order Act . All that is required is prior registration with the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation before engaging in an event at the venue . However , permits are required if the event concerns matters directly or indirectly relating to any religious belief or religion generally , or which may " cause feelings of enmity , hatred , ill @-@ will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore " ; or involves the display of any banner , film , photograph , placard or poster containing violent , lewd or obscene material . 
 The creation of Speakers ' Corner has been criticized as a governmental concession to free speech which remains fairly restrictive . The number of events staged at the venue has gone down over the years ; this has been attributed to the prevalence of more widespread , effective and convenient communication channels such as television programmes , and the Internet and its online fora . In the words of Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong , Speakers ' Corner has been " playing the same role as envisaged – mostly dormant but good to have " . 
 = = = = New media = = = = 
 According to Tan Tarn How , a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies and former journalist , Singapore newspapers " have a long record of publicly endorsing the PAP @-@ led government 's position " . Thus , passing through the mainstream media 's filters , news about opposition political parties can end up marginalized or unreported , as compared to updates from the ruling party . Should the media avoid reporting opposition @-@ related events , voters are effectively deprived of making an informed choice . In <unk> v. Spain ( 1992 ) , the European Court of Human Rights said : 
 Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders . In particular , it gives politicians the opportunity to reflect and comment on the preoccupations of public opinion ; it thus enables everyone to participate in the free political debate which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society . 
 With the advent of new media , pro @-@ PAP views in mainstream media are countered by websites expressing the views of Internet users which have been omitted from newspapers and television , thus providing additional platforms for expression which are vital in inculcating a more open and democratic society . 
 Moves by politicians to embrace public opinion on unofficial and informal new media platforms also illustrate how freedom of speech and expression is upheld , and , in fact , increasingly encouraged and taken into account in Singapore 's system of representative democracy . More politicians have been engaging citizens through the Internet through social networking websites and online fora . Former Foreign Minister George Yeo has been actively communicating with netizens on the ubiquitous social networking website Facebook , and has amassed many " friends " who are interested in local political affairs . His willing and frank engagement was evident in the run @-@ up to Singapore 's 2011 presidential election , as he had initially contemplated contesting for the Elected Presidency after losing his parliamentary seat in the 2011 general elections , though he subsequently decided not to . Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong engaged in a web chat with netizens on the People 's Action Party 's Facebook page in May 2011 to answer questions and assuage their concerns . 
 = = = Restrictions on free speech = = = 
 Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution recognizes that certain restrictions on speech and expression are necessary in the public interest . It states that Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and expression " as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof , friendly relations with other countries , public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court , defamation or incitement to any offence " . 
 However , potentially severe restrictions on free speech , some of which are elaborated upon below , may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views . These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld , and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by the fear of defamation suits . 
 = = = = Defamation law = = = = 
 The frequency of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics , in particular political opponents , has been a cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State . Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians . This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially , causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections . The resulting perception is that Singapore 's leadership has a long @-@ standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views . 
 The Government has denied these claims , citing the lack of substantiating evidence . Noting that many opposition politicians routinely criticize government leaders but are not sued because they have not uttered slanderous falsehoods , it insists that free speech and the right to disagree are upheld , the effects of which are characteristic of a representative democracy . The Government has also pointed out that Singapore 's legal system has won excellent ratings in international surveys . Lee Kuan Yew has also defended the system , asserting that doing things the Government 's way has allowed Singapore to be prosperous , orderly and corruption @-@ free whilst gaining international respect ; and that the " threat of defamation proceedings may make opposition politicians weigh their words more carefully than they do elsewhere " . 
 = = = = Public Entertainments and Meetings Act and Public Order Act = = = = 
 Since free speech may be exercised during assemblies and gatherings , Article 14 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Constitution , which guarantees freedom of assembly , is relevant . Prior to October 2009 , the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ( " PEMA " ) required a licence to be obtained from the Public Entertainments Licensing Unit ( PELU ) of the Singapore Police Force before talks , discussions or similar events open to the public were held . Holding an event without a licence would result in a fine or imprisonment . Members of opposition parties claimed that PELU acted inconsistently in issuing licences , and that they had been denied licences without reason . The Workers ' Party was fined $ 800 after a dinner event in 1986 , at which the Party 's Secretary @-@ General J.B. Jeyaretnam had given a speech . PELU decreed that since the publicly delivered speech had been unrelated to the festivities , a separate licence from the dinner itself was needed . In addition , the Act exempted public entertainments provided by or under the auspices of the Government , thus allowing MPs from the ruling PAP to speak without a licence in their capacity as grassroots advisors . 
 With effect from 9 October 2009 , PEMA was amended to exclude " any lecture , talk , address , debate or discussion in any place to which the public or any class of the public has access whether gratuitously or otherwise " from the definition of public entertainment , with the consequence that a licence is no longer required under this Act for such events . Under the Public Order Act , which introduced this change , a permit must generally be obtained from the Commissioner of Police before any public assembly is held . However , no permit is required for public assemblies held inside buildings or other enclosed premises where the organizers and speakers are all Singapore citizens ; the event does not deal with any matter " which relates ( directly or indirectly ) to any religious belief or religion , or any matter which may cause feelings of enmity , hatred , ill @-@ will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore " ; and the organizer or an authorized agent of the organizer is present at all times . 
 = = = = Media regulation = = = = 
 Both media ownership and content are carefully regulated by the Government . Given how government @-@ linked companies appear to exercise a near monopoly over the mainstream media in Singapore , the view has been taken that the mainstream media take a predominantly pro @-@ PAP stance in their reporting and suppress or disregard the viewpoints of opposition parties . The Government has justified this approach by stressing that the media should play a constructive role in nation @-@ building by adopting and presenting a national perspective on issues . In other words , the media should support the goals of the elected leadership and extol consensus instead of contention to enhance national strength and competitiveness , and thus " assiduously eschew advancing its own political agenda " at the expense of straightforward truth . 
 = = = = = Broadcasting and films = = = = = 
 Under the Broadcasting ( Class Licence ) Notification , issued under section 9 of the Broadcasting Act , all Internet content providers such as bloggers are automatically considered to be licensed and must comply with the conditions of the class licence and the Internet Code of Practice issued by the Media Development Authority ( MDA ) . In particular , it is mandatory for an Internet content provider to register with the MDA if it is , or if the Authority thinks that it is , an individual providing any programme about or a body of persons engaged in the " propagation , promotion or discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore , on the World Wide Web through the Internet " . The MDA can fine a licensee , or suspend or cancel its licence , if it has breached the terms of its licence , any relevant code of practice issued by the Authority , any provisions of the Broadcasting Act , or any direction issued by the Authority or the Minister for Communications and Information . In addition , it is an offence to provide a broadcasting service without a licence , and a convicted person is liable to a fine of up to $ 200 @,@ 000 , jail of up to three years , or both . If the offence continues after conviction , a further fine of up to $ 10 @,@ 000 per day may be imposed . 
 The Minister may declare that any foreign broadcasting service which is rebroadcast in Singapore has been " engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore " . <unk> such a " declared foreign broadcasting service " is prohibited without the Minister 's approval , which can be refused , revoked without reasons , or granted on conditions , which may include restrictions on the number of people permitted to receive the service and suspensions of the service for certain periods . Failing to comply with the above rules is a crime punishable by a fine of up to $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 It is an offence under section 33 of the Films Act to distribute , import , make , reproduce , or exhibit or possess for exhibition any " party political film " . A party political film is one that is " an advertisement made by or on behalf of any political party in Singapore or any body whose objects relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore , or any branch of such party or body " , or a film that is " directed towards any political end in Singapore " . The latter phrase is defined in the Act as follows : 
 ... [ A ] film is directed towards a political end in Singapore if the film – 
 ( a ) contains wholly or partly any matter which , in the opinion of the Board [ of Film Censors ] , is intended or likely to affect voting in any election or national referendum in Singapore ; or 
 ( b ) contains wholly or partly references to or comments on any political matter which , in the opinion of the Board , are either partisan or biased ; and “ political matter ” includes but is not limited to any of the following : 
 ( i ) an election or a national referendum in Singapore ; 
 ( ii ) a candidate or group of candidates in an election ; 
 ( iii ) an issue submitted or otherwise before electors in an election or a national referendum in Singapore ; 
 ( iv ) the Government or a previous Government or the opposition to the Government or previous Government ; 
 ( v ) a Member of Parliament ; 
 ( vi ) a current policy of the Government or an issue of public controversy in Singapore ; or 
 ( vii ) a political party in Singapore or any body whose objects relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore , or any branch of such party or body . 
 However , the following types of films are not considered to be party political films : 
 ( a ) a film which is made solely for the purpose of reporting of news by a broadcasting service licensed under any written law ; 
 ( b ) a film which is made solely for the purpose of informing or educating persons on the procedures and polling times for any election or national referendum in Singapore ; 
 ( c ) a film which records live the whole or a material proportion of any performance , assembly of persons or procession that is held in accordance with the law and that does not depict any event , person or situation in a dramatic way ; 
 ( d ) a film designed to provide a record of an event or occasion that is held in accordance with the law for those who took part in the event or occasion or are connected with those who did so ; 
 ( e ) a documentary film without any animation and composed wholly of an accurate account depicting actual events , persons ( deceased or otherwise ) or situations , but not a film – 
 ( i ) wholly or substantially based on unscripted or “ reality ” type programmes ; or 
 ( ii ) that depicts those events , persons or situations in a dramatic way ; 
 ( f ) a film without animation and dramatic elements – 
 ( i ) composed wholly of a political party ’ s manifesto or declaration of policies or ideology on the basis of which candidates authorised by the political party to stand will seek to be elected at a parliamentary election ; and 
 ( ii ) made by or on behalf of that political party ; and 
 ( g ) a film without animation and dramatic elements –

 = = = = = Newspapers = = = = = 
 The Newspaper and Printing Presses Act ( " NPPA " ) generally imposes curbs on the foreign ownership of newspaper companies , and requires a permit to be obtained for the publication , sale and distribution of newspapers . It also enables the Minister for Communications and Information to restrict the circulation of any foreign newspaper that has been declared to be " engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore " . In February 1987 , such a declaration was made against The Asian Wall Street Journal and its circulation was limited to 400 copies . The newspaper 's publisher , Dow Jones Publishing Co . ( Asia ) Inc . , unsuccessfully challenged the decision before the High Court and the Court of Appeal . The Court of Appeal interpreted the term domestic politics broadly , holding that in Singapore 's context it included : 
 ... the political system of Singapore and the political ideology underpinning it , the public institutions that are a manifestation of the system and the policies of the government of the day that give life to the political system . In other words , the domestic politics of Singapore relate to the multitude of issues concerning how Singapore should be governed in the interest and for the welfare of its people . 
 In a September 2011 statement , the Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts justified the NPPA 's existence , stating : " The various safeguards provided for in the NPPA help to ensure that the media operating in Singapore play a responsible role and that publishers are accountable for the content they publish . The safeguards also prevent local newspapers from being manipulated by foreign interests which can have a divisive effect on social cohesion . These considerations are still valid today . Journalistic freedom to report responsibly has not been compromised . "

 Under the Internal Security Act , the Minister for Communications and Information is empowered to prohibit the printing , publication , sale , issue , circulation or possession of any document or publication on the ground , among others , that it is prejudicial to the national interest , public order or security of Singapore . Doing any of the above acts in relation to a banned publication is a criminal offence . Among the publications that have been interdicted under this Act are works by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong , and the Russian political newspaper Pravda . A similar power to prohibit the importation , sale or circulation of publications that are considered to be contrary to the public interest exists under the Undesirable Publications Act . 
 = = = = = Election advertising = = = = = 
 Advertising on the Internet was liberalized by the Government in time for the 2011 general elections . Two forms of political advertising on the Internet are permitted during parliamentary elections . First , during the election period – that is , the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day – political parties , candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates ' campaigns , including using websites , chat rooms or discussion forums , video and photograph sharing or hosting websites , e @-@ mail , micro @-@ blog posts ( such as Twitter ) , SMS and MMS messages , digital audio and video files , electronic media applications , and blogs and social networking services ( such as Facebook ) . Election advertising sent by e @-@ mail , micro @-@ blog post , SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e @-@ mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender . 
 However , the Internet may not be used to publish the following : 
 Election surveys , defined as opinion surveys of how electors will vote at an election , or of the preferences of electors concerning any candidate or group of candidates or any political party or issue with which an identifiable candidate or group of candidates is associated at an election . 
 Appeals for money or other property in association with a representation that it will be applied for the objects or activities of any political party or for the promotion of any candidate or group of candidates . 
 Any facility enabling members of the public to search for unlawful election advertising . 
 Party political films not permitted by the Films Act . 
 Secondly , when candidates wish to publish election advertising on the Internet during the campaign period – that is , the period from the closure of the place of nomination on nomination day after the election is adjourned to enable a poll to be taken , to the start of the eve of polling day – they must provide to the returning officer , within 12 hours after the start of the period , declarations containing information on all the online platforms the advertising has appeared on in that time . Subsequently , a similar declaration must be provided before election advertising is published on such platforms . 
 Individuals who are Singapore citizens may publish on the Internet material that amounts to election advertising without having to comply with the above regulations so long as they do so personally and not at the direction of another person or on that person 's behalf , and do not receive any benefit for doing so . 
 During presidential elections , candidates may advertise on the Internet except on the eve of polling day and polling day itself . However , on those days , it remains legal for people to convey their own political views on a non @-@ commercial basis to others by telephonic or electronic transmission , and election advertising may remain unaltered on the Internet if it was lawfully published before the eve of polling day . 
 = = Other controversies relating to representative democracy = = 
 Over the years , the Government has been accused of slowing down the progress of democracy by using the Internal Security Act to detain political opponents and suppress political criticism and dissent by organizations such as the Asian Legal Resource Centre and Human Rights Watch . A similar allegation was made by presidential election candidate Tan Jee Say in 2011 . Conversely , the Government has repeatedly asserted that " [ n ] o person has ever been detained only for their political beliefs " .

 = = Plot = = 
 Murli Prasad Sharma alias Munna Bhai ( Sanjay Dutt ) , a gangster who is in love with the voice of Janhavi ( Vidya Balan ) , a radio jockey , devises a plan to meet her when she announces a quiz contest featuring the life and beliefs of Mahatma Gandhi , to be aired on 2 October , the birthday of Gandhi . To prepare for the contest , Munna 's sidekick Circuit ( Arshad Warsi ) kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna . After winning the contest , Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein he presents himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist . Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in her home , called the ' Second Innings House . ' To prepare for this event , Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute . For three days and nights ( and without food or sleep ) , Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi . 
 It is during this period that the image of Gandhi ( Dilip Prabhavalkar ) , addressed by his nickname " Bapu " ( " father " ) , appears and offers help and advice to Munna . Gandhi encourages Munna to tell the truth about himself to Janhavi , but Munna resists this advice . With Gandhi 's help , Munna succeeds in impressing Jahnavi and cultivates a new lifestyle based upon Gandhism . Munna starts to co @-@ host a radio @-@ show with Janhavi and Gandhi 's image , guiding his audience to use Gandhigiri to solve everyday problems . 
 The film has several subplots . One of the most prominent of these details the story of Lucky Singh ( Boman Irani ) and his daughter Simran ( Dia Mirza ) . Lucky is an unscrupulous businessman who employs Circuit and Munna Bhai to conduct underworld activities for him . His daughter , Simran , is engaged to marry Sunny ( Abhishek Bachchan ) , the son of the powerful businessman Kkhurana ( Kulbhushan Kharbanda ) . Kkhurana is superstitious and his activities are controlled by his astrologer , <unk> Maharaj ( Saurabh Shukla ) , whose particular use of numerology led Kkhurana to add an extra " K " to his real name ( Khurana ) as well as to the conclusion that the ' Second Innings House ' would be the most auspicious place for Sunny and Simran to live . Maharaj also convinces Kkhurana to reject the marriage between Simran and Sunny when it is revealed that Simran is considered to be a <unk> ( an individual whose Vedic astrological makeup is believed by some to be devastating for marriage , mostly leading to the death of the spouse after a certain calculated period of marriage ) . Lucky appropriates the ' Second Innings House ' by sending Munna to Goa ( keeping him out of the way ) and then blackmailing him to let the matter pass or risk losing his love <unk> . In response , Munna launches a " non @-@ violent " protest to reclaim the house . He calls this protest " Get Well Soon , Lucky " and asks his radio show 's audience to send Lucky flowers ( red roses especially ) to help him recover from the " disease of dishonesty " . 
 During this time Munna tells Janhavi the truth ( via a letter he gives to her ) . Heartbroken , Janhavi leaves Munna . Munna receives another setback when he is tricked by Lucky into revealing his conversations with Gandhi before a public audience . At this conference , Munna finds that only after he has learned something about " Bapu " ' s life can the Gandhi image talk about it , which serves as proof for a psychiatrist in the audience that Munna is delusional . Gandhi 's monologue at the end of the film , however , questions this conclusion . Munna , despite these defeats , continues to use Gandhigiri , a decision that transforms Lucky , revives Janhavi 's affection , and resolves Simran 's marriage . Lucky Singh eventually becomes a student of Gandhigiri and is greeted by Gandhi 's image not long after he has begun to study " Bapu " ' s life . Immediately he calls for a photograph to be taken of them together ; this perplexes the photographer , who cannot see the Gandhi image .

 The Munna Bhai series began after Vidhu Vinod Chopra agreed to produce Rajkumar Hirani 's 2003 film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. when no one else would ( Hirani had worked as an editor on Chopra 's 2000 film Mission Kashmir ) . They also collaborated on the script . Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. was a runaway success that prompted the duo to contemplate a sequel . The sequel was initially known as Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi and was later titled Munnabhai 2nd Innings before being given its current name . 
 Hirani admitted in an interview that he felt the burden of expectation while writing the screenplay for Lage Raho Munna Bhai , as he had to create " something to match " the first film . Initially there was some effort to incorporate scenes or characteristics of the first film into the sequel ( such as the idiosyncratic laugh of Dr. <unk> , portrayed by Boman Irani in the first installment ) , but the risks of repetition were consciously averted . 
 One of Hirani 's goals in making the film was to revive an interest in Mahatma Gandhi , a figure whom he felt had been forgotten in contemporary India . To highlight this fact , Hirani recounted ( during an interview ) an incident with a chai @-@ <unk> boy ( who brings tea to the crew ) during production : 
 The boy was curious , he was a big Munnabhai fan and kept asking the name of the film . The first working title was ' Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi , ' and Shantanu ( Moitra , the music director ) told him . So he said , ' Munnabhai to <unk> hai , yeh Mahatma Gandhi <unk> hai ? ' ( ' Munnabhai is fine , but who is this Mahatma Gandhi ? ' ) So this is the sad state of affairs today . I was shocked . And it 's not just the chai @-@ <unk> . A few days ago on TV a lot of politicians were asked India @-@ related questions on the news channels , and I can 't believe a lot of them don 't know 2 October is <unk> 's birthday ! Many didn 't know his first name . They kept saying , ' what 's in a name , we respect his ideals , ' but come on ! How can you not know his name ? 
 The other screenwriter , Abhijat Joshi ( who teaches in the department of English at Otterbein College in Westerville , Ohio ) , stated that he had been conducting extensive research on Gandhi , which inspired producer Chopra to involve Joshi in the creation of the second Munna Bhai screenplay . 
 While writing the screenplay , Hirani and Joshi stayed together for more than four months . They developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing the scene . They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh , or cry , or had some provocative thought . While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. , the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai , as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary ( including a Jimmy Jib , a specific kind of camera crane , just for a single crane shot ) . The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai , with Goa as a backdrop for the " Aane <unk> " song . 
 Only two characters — those of Munna Bhai ( portrayed by Sanjay Dutt ) and Circuit ( portrayed by Arshad Warsi ) — were retained from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. Several actors from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. , appeared in Lage Raho Munna Bhai as different characters . Vidya Balan was chosen to play the leading lady as her voice was thought to be appropriate for that of a radio jockey . 
 The actors used several techniques to develop their characters . Arshad Warsi ( " Circuit " ) encountered some initial problems reviving his character from the first film . On the first day of the shoot when Arshad , " said his first line , he didn 't sound like Circuit at all . He sounded like Arshad Warsi speaking with an accent . " Warsi admits that he had " forgotten " the character of Circuit and had to watch the DVD of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. three times before being able to film the scene correctly . Sanjay Dutt ( " Munna Bhai " ) also confessed that he had to watch the first film eight to nine times to recapture the " persona " of Munna Bhai . In addition , Dutt stated in an interview that he did not read Gandhi 's autobiography My Experiments with Truth as a preparation for Lage Raho Munna Bhai . Rather , he comments , his father , Sunil Dutt ( who portrays Munna Bhai 's father in the first film , Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. ) and his mother ( the late actress Nargis ) were his role models as they " were basically <unk> . We were brought up with those values . " 
 Dilip Prabhavalkar , who portrays Gandhi , read Gandhi 's works " once again " to prepare for his role . Boman Irani prepared for the role of Lucky Singh by spending time with <unk> ( male Sikhs ) in auto spare parts shops to research his role . Vidya Balan ( " Jahnavi " ) met with a couple of radio jockeys and watched them at work . 
 = = Themes and impact = = 
 = = = Influences and allusions = = = 
 Each film in the Munna Bhai series features Munna and Circuit in a story that is comprehensive unto itself and is not continued or referred to in another in the series . Director Hirani has compared this format to the films of Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy , as well as to the James Bond series . Others have also likened the series to the work of Laurel and Hardy . Some , however , have negated this comparison , stating that the series is more akin to the Road to ... " buddy films " of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby . Hirani stated that his work was deeply inspired by the films of Hrishikesh Mukherjee . 
 = = = Social influence = = = 
 The interaction between the central characters of Mahatma Gandhi and Munna Bhai highlights concepts and ideas that draw upon the period of Colonial India and the Indian independence movement . Gandhi was a leader in this movement , challenging the British Empire 's presence in India through the use of Satyagraha ( non @-@ violence ) . In the film , Jahnavi and Munna Bhai 's non @-@ violent protest against Lucky Singh serves as a metaphor for the Indian independence movement and the battle against the British Raj . 
 The thematic attention to Gandhi 's theories in Lage Raho Munna Bhai revived an interest in Gandhism in India under the new term Gandhigiri and " made Gandhi suddenly hip " with Indians " staging nonviolent protests , starting Web sites , handing out roses to enemies and putting on peaked white caps from the Gandhi era . " <unk> Ghosh , in December 2006 , noted in The Economic and Political Weekly that , " Gandhi , the man , was once the message . In the India of the post @-@ liberalisation brand , <unk> is the message . " Amelia Gentleman of The International Herald Tribune / New York Times stated in September 2006 that : 
 " The real excitement was a Bollywood film [ ... ] which [ became ] the unexpected box @-@ office hit of the year [ ... ] With its big Bollywood soundtrack and dance routines , the movie brings Gandhi firmly into the mainstream and theaters have been packed for the past three weeks . The Congress Party recommended that all party members see the film . The Delhi authorities declared that tickets to the film would be sold tax free because of its assiduous promotion of Gandhian values . " 
 Mark <unk> of The Christian Science Monitor argued in 2006 that the film was appealing because , " Gandhi gets his hands dirty . He appears as an apparition only visible to the wayward gangster , counselling him on how to help others deal with everyday problems . " Swati Gauri Sharma suggested in The Boston Globe that what the United States " needs is a film that encourages people to take up Gandhigiri , <unk> , or <unk> . If it worked for Bollywood , it could work for Hollywood . " 
 = = = Gandhigiri @-@ style protests = = = 
 After the release of the film , Gandhigiri @-@ style protests began to take place in India . In 2006 , farmers staged a protest with flowers in the Vidarbha region , and people who organised a protest in Lucknow claimed to have been inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai to use roses to convey their message . In Lucknow , students claimed to have been inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai to do volunteer work , planting trees " to conserve nature which is bound to benefit public health . " Mafia don <unk> Srivastava claimed to have been inspired by Lago Raho Munna Bhai to distribute roses as a " message of love and peace " . In 2008 , Indian Greenpeace activists delivered thousands of roses to Ratan Tata , chairman of Tata Motors , to reconsider his plans of building a port at the nesting grounds of Olive Ridley sea turtles . The " Send Pramod <unk> a Valentine ’ s Day card " campaign in 2009 was inspired by the film . 
 In the United States during July 2007 , Aman Kapoor , founder of the Immigration Voice forum , initiated a Gandhigiri protest inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai . Over a three @-@ day period , hundreds of flower bouquets were sent to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ( <unk> ) office by Indians who were legally in the U.S. but caught in a green card backlog . On 17 July , the <unk> reversed the decision that led to the protest .

 Lage Raho Munna Bhai revived an interest in books about Gandhi . In particular , demand for Gandhi 's autobiography My Experiments with Truth increased after the film debuted , including requests from prison inmates . In addition , due to its influence , the film was made tax @-@ free in Mumbai .

" Singh announced the creation of a new Public Services Bill to combat corruption in a press release dated 17 November 2006 , and cited Lage Raho Munna Bhai as one of its influences . 
 Lage Raho Munna Bhai was further screened at a global judiciary summit in Lucknow in December 2006 . After viewing the film , Justice Kenneth <unk> from South Africa commented , " The movie has re @-@ enlivened the non @-@ violence philosophy practiced by Mahatma Gandhi who continues to remain close to the hearts of the South Africans .

" Rajeev Masand of CNN @-@ IBN gave it four out of five stars and states : " Like those good old @-@ fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films , it also reinforces the importance of human goodness and basic niceties . Even if you might argue that some of Gandhi 's principles seem outdated today , you cannot help but cheer for Munna and his gang as they achieve the impossible with love and kindness . And that is where this film transcends conventional boundaries . It entertains you , yes , but it also makes you yearn for a perfect world . Judge it by any yardstick that you may , Lage Raho Munnabhai emerges a clear winner . Much of that credit must go to its actors who pull out all stops to make it an enjoyable ride . " Poonam Joshi of the BBC gave four out of five stars stating that , " everything about this film works [ ... ] It 's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly . And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them . It 's testimony both to the quality of the writing and the performances , that Munna and Circuit have taken on a life of their own . " Vinayak Chakravorty of The Hindustan Times gave four out of four stars stating that it " cleverly works its way around the obvious hurdle that almost all sequels face : The film recreates an original milieu without a hint of the déjà vu downer . And that precisely ranks Munna Bhai 2 as one of the best entertainers this year . " He commended the it for showing " the heights Hindi cinema can scale despite staying within its masala parameters . Lage <unk> , guys . " Phelim O 'Neill of The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars noting that , " as western romantic comedies become more vapid and even <unk> , this delivers a credible message of peace , while never forgetting to be magnificent entertainment . " Shastri <unk> of The Tribune wrote , " True , there have been memorable films on Mahatma Gandhi by distinguished directors , namely Richard Attenborough and Shyam Benegal ; one offering a respectful cinematic acquaintance and the other being didactic but inspiring . For all their earnestness , neither film stirred the popular imagination like <unk> has done now . " Vaidyanathan from BBC declared that , " Lage Raho is not only as good as MBBS , but much better " calling it " a brilliant emotional roller coaster ride . " Jeremy Page of The Times discussed its enormous popularity upon release and noted the " serious point [ the film made ] about the need for tolerance , restraint and self @-@ sacrifice . " 
 Finally , filmmaker Kabir Khan cited Lage Raho Munna Bhai as a model film for him as it " had an issue , but it was never once in your face . Rajkumar Hirani kept it all so subtle and yet conveyed the message so well . It was as commercial as it gets and audiences too were thoroughly entertained . That 's the way to make movies because it not just made all parties happy but also had a satisfied director at the end of it all . " 
 According to Tushar Gandhi , Gandhi 's great @-@ grandson , it introduced the philosophies of Gandhi to a new generation , adding that " Bapu would 've spoken the language of Gandhigiri if he were alive today . I really feel this film says something that needs to be told . " 
 Other critics offered more negative reviews . Ajit Duara argues in The Hindu that " the accomplished cultural sophistication and political genius of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi has to be dumbed down to the astoundingly moronic levels of Lage Raho Munnabhai . " Filmmaker <unk> Barua was also critical , stating that " Gandhian philosophy is serious business and Lage Raho Munna Bhai is not the right way to show it . " Jug Suraiya of The Times of India wrote that " thanks to Munnabhai , at best what exists of Gandhism is Gandhigiri , a watered down , Dale Carnegie 's How to Win Friends and Influence People version of the original .

 = Dragonlance = 
 Dragonlance is a shared universe created by Laura and Tracy Hickman , and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis under the direction of TSR , Inc. into a series of popular fantasy novels . The Hickmans conceived Dragonlance while driving in their car on the way to TSR for a job interview . At TSR Tracy met Margaret Weis , his future writing partner , and they gathered a group of associates to play the Dungeons & Dragons role @-@ playing game . The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules , a series of novels , licensed products such as board games , and lead miniature figures . 
 In 1984 , TSR published the first Dragonlance novel , Dragons of Autumn Twilight . It began the Chronicles trilogy , a core element of the Dragonlance world . While the authoring team of Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis wrote the setting 's central books , numerous other authors contributed novels and short stories to the setting . Over 190 novels have used the Dragonlance setting , and have been accompanied by supplemental Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting material for over a decade . In 1997 , Wizards of the Coast LLC purchased TSR , and licensed Dragonlance to Sovereign Press , Inc in 2001 to produce game materials ; this licensing agreement expired in 2007 . 
 The fictional Dragonlance world of Krynn contains numerous characters , an extensive timeline , and a detailed geography . The history of Krynn consists of five ages . The novels and related game products are primarily set in the fourth age , The Age of Despair . Since February 2009 , the fifth age , the Age of Mortals , has been used . The Heroes of the Lance , created by Weis and Hickman , are the popular protagonists of the Chronicles trilogy . Along with D & D 's world of the Forgotten Realms , Dragonlance is one of the most popular shared worlds in fiction . 
 = = World = = 
 The Dragonlance world is described in dozens of books and novels . The setting contains numerous characters , an extensive timeline , and a detailed geography . 
 = = = Krynn = = = 
 Dragonlance is set on the world of Krynn . The majority of the novels take place in the various regions of Ansalon , a small continent , though some have taken place on the continent of <unk> , located northeast of Ansalon . The world 's major gods are the High God and his children : good Paladine , neutral <unk> , and evil Takhisis . The gods are opposed by Chaos , who seeks to destroy Krynn . Depending on the time period , the evil chromatic and the good metallic dragons are rare or plentiful . Humans are Krynn 's most common humanoid race , but elves , dwarves , kender , gnomes , and minotaurs occupy the world as well . Clerics derive magical powers from their gods , and wizards derive their power from the three moon gods , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Hickman had previously served as a Mormon missionary in Java for two years , and uses Indonesian in Dragonlance spells . During Krynn 's various wars , armies of draconians are used as troops . Draconians are created by corrupting a dragon egg , thereby creating a reptilian humanoid . The eggs of good dragons create evil draconians , and vice versa . 
 = = = Fictional history = = = 
 The history of the world of Krynn , and thus the settings for both the novels and gaming supplements , is roughly split into five separate ages . The first age is the time of creation , when the gods are born and Krynn is formed . The Age of Dreams , the second age , is marked by the rapid growth of the world 's first great civilizations and the appearance of myriad new races . This era is also marked by three great wars between dragons and their minions . Following the Third Dragon War , in the Age of Might , the Cataclysm obliterates the great empire of <unk> and changes almost the entire surface of Krynn . A three @-@ hundred year depression follows this event , in what is called the Age of Despair . This period also marks the War of the Lance . When Dragonlance was first introduced to Dungeons & Dragons , events such as the Lost Wars happened during The Age of Despair . 
 = = = Dragonlances = = = 
 Dragonlances are weapons first created in the Third Dragon War , designed with the purpose of killing evil dragons , and are the only weapons with which mortals can kill dragons . Dragonlances have this power because of the way in which they are created , which requires the use of " two god @-@ blessed artifacts " . The weapons clearly draw upon Christian iconography , as the two mythical figures shown defeating dragons , Archangel Michael and Saint George , are often portrayed wielding lances to do so . 
 Dragonlances are rare and not commonly traded . There are lesser dragonlances , which are made when only one of the artifacts is used to create them , and greater dragonlances , which are made when both artifacts are used to make them . Greater dragonlances are blessed with the power of Good , unlike lesser dragonlances . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The Heroes of the Lance are the protagonists of the Chronicles trilogy , the first series of Dragonlance books . They were created by Weis and Hickman , then fleshed out as player characters in gaming sessions of Dungeons & Dragons at Hickman 's apartment . One player at this initial gaming session was game designer Terry Phillips , who was playing as Raistlin . According to Hickman in the foreword to The <unk> , " [ we ] were just settling in to the game when I turned to my good friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing . Terry spoke ... and the world of Krynn was forever changed . His rasping voice , his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real . Everyone in the room was both transfixed and terrified . To this day Margaret [ Weis ] swears that Terry wore the black robes to the party that night . " 
 Several other Heroes of the Lance were played by various people . Authors Gary and Janet Pack played the half @-@ elf Tanis Half @-@ Elven and the kender Tasslehoff Burrfoot , respectively . Author Douglas Niles played the dwarf Flint Fireforge . TSR employee Harold Johnson played the <unk> knight Sturm Brightblade . The rest of the Heroes are the barbarians Goldmoon and Riverwind , elf Laurana Kanan , and humans Caramon Majere ( Raistlin 's brother ) and Tika Waylan . Weis played <unk> the Fabulous . 
 In the beginning , Margaret Weis had problems depicting Tanis Half @-@ Elven in the novels . Tracy Hickman finally told her " He 's James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise . " After that explanation , Margaret had no more difficulty writing about Tanis . Other noteworthy antagonists , and sometimes protagonists , are the Death Knight Lord Soth and Kitiara Uth Matar , the half @-@ sister of Raistlin and Caramon , and leader of one of the <unk> of Ansalon . According to Hickman , Lord Soth is the most unpredictable character to write about , saying " Every time that character made an appearance in one of our books he would try to run off with the story . "

 = = = Creation = = = 
 Hickman developed his world creation technique by writing and self @-@ publishing with his wife Laura the adventure modules Rahasia ( 1979 ) and Pharaoh ( 1980 ) , and writing TSR 's Ravenloft module ( 1983 ) . He was unemployed in 1982 , and TSR offered him a job based on his submission of several modules . That year , while driving from Utah to Wisconsin to start a job with TSR , Hickman and his wife created the Dragonlance universe concept . During the trip , Hickman and his wife discussed two ideas they had had for several years : an entire world used to support a storyline , and a world dominated by dragons . 
 Their ideas were well received by TSR , whose marketing department felt they had enough dungeons , but not enough dragons . Hickman suggested a series of twelve modules , each featuring a different dragon . TSR employee Harold Johnson suggested that Hickman should try to get additional support from other TSR staff members and , after a period of months , Hickman had the support of Jeff Grubb , Larry Elmore , Roger Moore , Doug Niles , Michael Williams , and others with whom they discussed ideas for the project . Meanwhile , Weis was editing and writing various Endless Quest books for TSR . The Dragonlance group decided that novels should accompany the game modules ; TSR reluctantly agreed and hired a writer . Hickman became the design coordinator for Project Overlord , the cover name for what would later be known as the Dragonlance saga . 
 TSR decided to create a franchise , including modules , board games , lead figures , and — for the first time — novels . Weis had been hired as an editor ; with Hickman , she began working with the author hired to write the novels . They weren 't satisfied with the author , and decided they should be the ones to write the books . They collaborated over a weekend , writing the prologue for the first five chapters of the first novel , Dragons of Autumn Twilight , based on the module Dragons of Despair . TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment , firing the author . After two years of development , TSR released Dragons of Autumn Twilight as a supplement to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game . TSR had doubts about the finished novel 's sales potential , and attempted to order thirty thousand copies , ultimately ordering the minimum print run of fifty thousand . The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand . Dragonlance eventually received ancillary products such as novels , calendars , computer games , and books of artwork .

 In the mid to late 1980s , a rift developed between Weis and Hickman , and TSR . The pair were feeling under @-@ appreciated by the company , and when TSR turned down their <unk> series of novels , they went to Bantam Books . Bantam made them an offer , which they accepted , and they stopped writing Dragonlance novels for TSR . They returned to write Dragons of Summer Flame for TSR in 1995 , thinking it would be their final Dragonlance novel . At the time , Dragonlance gaming had been converted to the SAGA System , with limited success , and that , combined with TSR 's general financial troubles , put the setting 's future in doubt . Wizards of the Coast bought the troubled TSR in 1997 , and Weis and Hickman then proposed the War of Souls trilogy , which was published in 2000 – 2002 . All three novels made the New York Times bestseller list , and the setting was commercially revitalized . By 1998 , the original Dragonlance trilogy had sold well over three million copies worldwide and spawned dozens of sequels . The central books of the Dragonlance series were written by the authoring team of Weis and Hickman ; however , many other writers have made contributions , including Richard A. Knaak , Douglas Niles , Roger E. Moore , Don Perrin , Jean Rabe , Paul B. Thompson , Tonya C. Cook , Michael Williams , Nancy Varian <unk> , and Chris Pierson . 
 In 2001 , Wizards of the Coast licensed Sovereign Press to publish further Dragonlance game materials . This began with the newly revised Dragonlance Campaign Setting in 2003 , which used the new Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition rules . On April 23 , 2007 , Weis announced Wizards of the Coast had not renewed Sovereign 's license , and that Dragonlance RPG game supplements and accessories would only be released through the end of the year . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Dragonlance is one of the most popular shared worlds , worlds in which writers other than those that created them place adventures . The first Dragonlance trilogy , Chronicles , launched the Dungeons & Dragons line of novels , with many of its characters spun off into other novels . Along with Forgotten Realms , Dragonlance is TSR 's most popular series of novels . According to The 1990s by Marc Oxoby , what is most notable about the series is that " what may at one time been considered disposable , escapist literature " found " unprecedented popularity " in the 1990s . All of the Dragonlance novels remained in print during the decade , turning Weis and Hickman into literary stars and boosting sales of their non @-@ Dragonlance novels . Although the series was initially published in paperback , its success led to hardcover printings . The hardcover version of Dragons of Summer Flame had an " impressive " first printing of 200 @,@ 000 books . Every Dragonlance novel by Weis and Hickman since 1995 has been released in hardcover , and some previous novels have been re @-@ released in hardcover collector 's editions . Dragonlance made TSR one of the most successful publishers of science fiction and fantasy in the 1990s . 
 By 2008 , there were more than 190 novels in the Dragonlance franchise . Weis and Hickman 's Dragonlance novels have made over twenty bestseller lists , with sales in excess of 22 million . The pair 's novels have been translated into German , Japanese , Danish , Finnish , Spanish , French , Italian , Hebrew , and Portuguese , and have sold well in the United States , Britain , and Australia . 
 Not all critics have praised Dragonlance and its creators . According to author Stephen Hunt , Wendy Bradley of Interzone magazine does not think highly of their work . Hunt feels that it is unusual for authors to receive such loathing among " fantasy 's literary mafia " , saying , " Behind every critic 's scorn laden insult , there lays [ sic ] that unsaid thought at the end : ' But I could have written that ! ' " Visions of Wonder , edited by David G. Hartwell and Milton T. Wolf , and published by the Science Fiction Research Association , argues that Dragonlance is published under the " omnivore theory " of publishing . In this theory , the readership is made up of teenagers , and completely replaces itself every three to five years . This allows publishers to release subpar novels and still reach a small yet profitable audience . 
 = = Novels = = 
 The main storyline of the original Dragonlance series has been written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman , with multiple books written by other authors , covering years between and sometimes during the main events . 
 The Chronicles trilogy relates the events since the meeting of the Companions until the end of the War of the Lance and the defeat of the Dragon armies of Ansalon . 
 The Legends trilogy covers the Blue Lady 's War , as well as the past adventures of Raistlin and Caramon Majere , culminating in Raistlin 's attempt to achieve godhood . The books feature time travel , and focus on events in <unk> before the Cataclysm , as well as the ensuing <unk> Wars . 
 The Second Generation is a single compilation book which picks the most important tales from the Tales series and details the children of the Companions , all of whom become players in the later story . This book is considered to be part of the main storyline , as it must be read to understand the events that happened between the War of the Lance and the Chaos War . This novel develops characters that would later be seen in the War of Souls trilogy . 
 Dragons of Summer Flame covers the Chaos War , also known as the Second Cataclysm . The gods and mortals join forces to defeat Chaos in his attempt to destroy Krynn . The war ends with the withdrawal of Chaos and the gods of Krynn in a divine agreement to keep the world safe . 
 Dragons of a New Age describes the rise of the Dragon Overlords and introduces the Fifth Age of Dragonlance . It leads into the War of Souls trilogy . 
 The War of Souls trilogy begins as a strange storm courses through Krynn , heralding the War of Souls . The end of the war brings the return of the gods , Takhisis 's death , and the departure of Paladine as head of the good gods in order to maintain the balance between Good and Evil . 
 The Dark Disciple trilogy follows the death of Takhisis and the departure of Paladine , when the lesser gods strive to maintain dominance . 
 The Lost Chronicles trilogy is a companion to the original Chronicles . Each book of the trilogy fills in sections of the story previously left untold . It tells the story surrounding the recovery of the Hammer of <unk> , how the Companions retrieve the dragon orb from Ice Wall , how Kitiara Uth Matar and Lord Soth became allies , and how Raistlin Majere took the Black Robes in <unk> .

 TSR created Dragonlance as a campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ( AD & D ) roleplaying game in 1982 , publishing the first of a series of modules , Dragons of Despair , in March 1984 . They published the first world @-@ spanning sourcebook , Dragonlance Adventures , in 1987 . When AD & D was updated to the 2nd edition in 1989 , the Dragonlance campaign setting was updated as well . However , in 1996 , Dragonlance was converted to use the new SAGA System , which uses cards to determine the effects of actions , with the publication of the Dragonlance : Fifth Age roleplaying game . When the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons was released , Dragonlance was again updated with a new sourcebook ( Dragonlance Campaign Setting ) , although no new adventures were published by Wizards of the Coast . Wizards of the Coast also turned over all responsibility for maintaining the Dragonlance setting in the 3rd edition to Margaret Weis 's home company , Sovereign Press .

 The <unk> game <unk> is based on Krynn during the final stage of the War of the Lance . 
 The series has inspired mention in music as well , including " Wishmaster " , a song by Nightwish based partially on the master and apprentice relationship between Raistlin Majere and <unk> . The Swedish metal band Lake of Tears also recorded a song called " Raistlin and the Rose " on their 1997 album Crimson Cosmos , while the German group Blind Guardian wrote " The <unk> " , another song inspired by Raistlin 's story , which appeared on the band 's 2002 album A Night at the Opera . Also Danish / American band <unk> recorded in their 2008 album Immortal song " Caramon 's Poem " . Another German metal band , <unk> , released The Chronicles Chapter I EP in 2008 and the full album Of Dragons And Elves in 2013 - both releases were composed entirely of songs inspired by and relating to Dragonlance . 
 In late 2011 , <unk> Studios Ltd. released the first part of a German audio adaption of the Chronicles Trilogy , with subsequent releases of the later trilogies being announced . 
 = McLaughlin Planetarium = 
 The McLaughlin Planetarium is a former working planetarium whose building occupies a space immediately to the south of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto , at 100 Queen 's Park . Founded by a grant from philanthropist Colonel R. Samuel McLaughlin , the facility was opened to the public on October 26 , 1968 . It had , for its time , a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art electro @-@ mechanical Zeiss planetarium projector that was used to project regular themed shows about the stars , planets , and cosmology for visitors . By the 1980s the planetarium 's sound @-@ system and domed ceiling were used to display dazzling music @-@ themed laser @-@ light shows . The lower levels of the planetarium contained a gallery called the " Astrocentre " that featured space @-@ related exhibits , related artifacts on the history of astronomy and was also home of the world 's first commercial <unk> 
 Starting in 1978 , there was a decline in attendance that lasted for four years while major construction was being undertaken at its sibling institution , the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum . This work also entailed the demolition of part of the planetarium 's facilities . Though attendance picked up when the museum reopened in 1984 , the planetarium was forced to close on November 5 , 1995 , due to provincial budget cuts to the museum . The planetarium 's exhibits , artifacts and theatre facilities were subsequently dismantled and dispersed . For a brief period it housed the Children 's Own Museum . It is now used solely for offices and as a storage facility for the museum . 
 Early in 2009 , the R.O.M. announced that it had sold the building and site to the University of Toronto , which plans to demolish the existing building to make way for additional facilities . In September , 2014 , the university announced preliminary plans for new facilities to be built on the site . 
 = = Beginnings = = 
 Proposals for building a planetarium in Toronto date back to 1944 , but serious planning only started in 1962 , thanks to a bequest made by a former member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada ( RASC ) . In May 1964 the Chairman and the President of the University of Toronto gave their support for the idea to the RASC , and suggested a site near the existing Royal Ontario Museum , adding that significant financial support would have to come from outside the University to make it possible . 
 In November 1964 Canadian businessman Colonel R. Samuel McLaughlin announced plans for donating money directly towards establishing a planetarium in Toronto . He was inspired by the recent construction of the Hayden Planetarium in New York , named after Charles Hayden , who had been a friend and associate on the board of International Nickel . McLaughlin donated $ 2 million for the building 's construction , and gave an additional $ 1 @.@ 15 million as an ongoing endowment . The University of Toronto , which owned and operated the Royal Ontario Museum prior to becoming a separate , provincially funded body , donated land adjacent to the museum . The building was constructed in an area that had formerly been a park belonging to the museum , and also required the demolition of a mansion at 86 Queens Park that had been the residence for the President of the University of Toronto . 
 The building was designed by architects Allward and <unk> and by the engineering firm Stone and Webster Canada , Ltd. in 1965 . Colonel McLaughlin unveiled a model of the building at his 94th birthday celebration , which was held in his honour at the museum in September of that year . It was hoped that the building would be open by Canada 's centennial in 1967 , but construction delays forced the opening to October 26 , 1968 . 
 In addition to what was built , the original plans also called for a multi @-@ story parking garage , a 550 @-@ seat conventional movie theatre , and a direct underground link to the Museum subway stop . These features were deemed too costly and were never built . 
 The building contained four floors : 
 a basement containing a lecture hall that hosted meetings of the Toronto branch of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada , as well as some general storage rooms ; 
 a ground floor that featured a small store selling space @-@ themed merchandise , a small library , coat @-@ check room , a prominent bronze bust of Colonel McLaughlin , and the box office and staff lounge ( not accessible to the public ) ; 
 a second floor , called the " Astrocentre " , which featured various astronomical exhibits and a line to the adjacent <unk> ; and 
 a third floor , called " The Theatre of the Stars " , was devoted wholly to astronomical shows , and featured a Zeiss planetarium projector along with 85 slide and video projectors used to recreate starry skies , along with two back rooms that housed computers , cooling systems , and audio / visual controllers . The public theatre could seat 340 people at a time , and contained a sound system of approximately 25 @,@ 000 watts . 
 = = The Building = = 
 The dominant feature of the building is the dome , which rises 25 @.@ 3 meters ( 83 ft ) from the ground , and has an outer diameter of 27 @.@ 7 meters ( 91 ft ) . The dome structure is layered , with an outer waterproofed casing of reinforced concrete 4 centimeters ( 2 @.@ 5 inches ) thick , and an inner concrete dome that is insulated by a layer of urethane foam . 
 The projection dome was separate from the outer dome , and was 23 meters ( 75 @.@ 4 ft ) in diameter . Made of curved aluminum sheets , it was lap jointed to create a continuous spherical surface . The sheets were painted white and perforated with 2 @.@ 5 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 1 inch ) holes , which were designed to let sound through and reduced echoes in the cavernous space . 
 The building had two main entrances : a main entrance at ground level that faced east onto Queen 's Park Drive , and a connecting passageway from the Royal Ontario Museum from what used to be the Mineralogy Gallery . Admission to either facility allowed visitors to see exhibits in both buildings , though a planetarium show cost extra . 
 = = Zeiss @-@ Jena planetarium projector = = 
 The planetarium projector was the focal piece of equipment at the planetarium . It was a Universal Projection Planetarium type 23 / 6 , made by <unk> <unk> Carl Zeiss in Jena , in what was then East Germany . 
 The planetarium projector was a 13 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) -long dumbbell @-@ shaped object , with 29 @-@ inch ( 740 mm ) -diameter spheres attached at each end representing the night sky for the northern and southern hemispheres . Connecting the two spheres was a framework that held nearly 150 individual projectors , including those dedicated to the planets , the Sun , and specific stars . 
 Improvements were made to the original planetarium projector over the years , allowing for special effects that could show close @-@ up displays of specific planets , and the Sun and Moon projectors could replicate the experience of a solar or lunar eclipse . 
 The projector could be controlled by a console where an individual presenter would provide specific talks or lectures . By the mid @-@ 1970s , automation features were added , which led to the creation of prerecorded shows . Most visitors to the facility would have seen an automated 40- to 45 @-@ minute audio / visual show on a particular space @-@ related topic . Two types of shows were typically alternated on a daily basis : one aimed at families with young children and another aimed at older children and adults . Typical shows aimed at both audience types were built around themes such as space travel , the mythical stories behind the constellations , and around Christmas @-@ time , a show that investigated theories on stellar explanations for the Star of Bethlehem . A listing from 1970 includes shows titled The Story of Eclipses , which looked at how solar eclipses occur and their scientific importance , Man and the Zodiac which explored the history of mythology and astrology with regard to the night sky , and The Planet Venus which surveyed the history of the planet in mythology , the planet 's motion across the sky and featured imagined views from its surface . 
 = = Renovations in the late 1970s and early 1980s = = 
 When plans were drawn up for a major expansion of the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum in the mid @-@ 1970s , it was initially assumed that the planetarium , then still a comparatively new facility , would be left untouched . As the scope of the expansion increased , it was realized that its north annex would need to be demolished in order to make way for the museum 's need for a wing devoted to curatorial facilities . As a result , a theatre entrance , sound studio , workshop , passenger elevator and a third of the existing gallery area of the planetarium had to go . The remaining gallery area was removed in March 1978 to make space for temporary space to replace the workshop and studio . 
 Significant changes to the planetarium were made during this time , including the addition of a new spiral staircase that led straight to the Theatre of the Stars , an adjacent elevator for the elderly and disabled , and a larger gallery space on the second floor . 
 The planetarium remained at normal levels of service during this renovation period , but attendance dropped significantly , particularly when the adjacent museum was closed for a period of two years during the most intensive phase of its second major expansion . In all , the construction phase lasted for four years , from 1978 to 1982 . In particular , some school groups that could justify the expense of seeing the museum and a planetarium show in a single day 's outing had difficulty justifying a visit solely to the planetarium .

 Some of the automated " star shows " that appeared in this time interval include : " Planets , Stars , and Galaxies " , a general show about our knowledge of astronomy at the time ; " Mars , the Journey Begins " , the story of the exploration of Mars ( from prehistory to the then @-@ present ) , and possible future plans for terraforming Mars ; " Beyond the 4th Dimension " , which explored , in layman 's terms , the 4 dimensions of General Relativity , the Big Bang and inflation , and the new ( at the time ) theories of physics that postulated that space has up to 11 dimensions ; some of these shows featured creative and novel sound tracks composed by composer @-@ in @-@ residence Mychael Danna . 
 While the main attraction continued to be the astronomical shows put on during the day , in the early 1980s , regular laser light shows became a staple evening 's entertainment in the city . Typical shows included " Laser Floyd : Dark Side of the Moon " , " Laser Zeppelin " , " Sgt. Peppers Laser Light Show " and later , such shows of more contemporary musical artists such as " Laser Depeche Mode " , " Laser NIN " and " Laser Nirvana " . These shows were held under the name " <unk> " rather than that of the planetarium , though the laser @-@ light and star shows were held in the same building . The laser shows were created by the Florida @-@ based firm Audio Visual Imagineering , whose shows are also seen at other planetaria . 
 Corporate events were promoted through The <unk> and included such events as a CTV Fall season launch as well as corporate <unk> of Sun Microsystems and product launches from NEC and other companies . 
 Other exhibits in the revamped Astrocentre included a new 50 @-@ seat mini @-@ theatre , wall murals illustrating the phases of the moon , plus an increasing number of hands @-@ on exhibits and interactive computer @-@ driven displays . There were also displays of astronomical globes , an orrery and pictures of the planets , many taken by contemporary space probes . The Astrocentre also featured the world 's first commercial <unk> , a slowly rotating display containing a 3D representation of almost a thousand stars in our immediate stellar neighbourhood . 
 = = Closure = = 
 The McLaughlin Planetarium was closed on November 5 , 1995 . The president of the ROM stated that the closure of the planetarium was due to a combination of falling attendance and a declining interest in space , and that the closure was necessitated by provincial budget cuts . The decision came as a surprise to many , as attendance had rebounded in recent years , and the planetarium was one of few in North America at the time that was turning a profit . The closure meant that 40 people lost their jobs . 
 Despite the ROM citing lowered attendance figures , proponents of the planetarium have alleged that the Conservative Ontario provincial government of the time , led by Mike Harris , was looking for an instant and visible $ 600 @,@ 000 cut to the ROM 's operating budget . No succeeding provincial government has shown an interest in reversing this decision . 
 Shortly after the announcement , the exhibits , seating and wiring were dismantled or removed . Some of the signs and paintings were recovered by the RASC , which had a permanent workspace located within the facility , and are now on display at the E.C. Carr Astronomical Observatory and at David Dunlap Observatory . The original Zeiss @-@ Jena projector was bought as a museum piece by York University for the sum of $ 1 , subsequently dismantled , and placed into storage . More recently , the University has offered the mothballed projector to other planetaria seeking parts to repair their existing electro @-@ mechanical planetarium projectors . 
 = = After the closure = = 
 The planetarium has been reopened for other purposes since it closed its doors as a planetarium in 1995 . On March 5 , 1998 , an initial three @-@ year agreement was signed that brought the Children 's Own Museum to the second floor of the planetarium , where the Astrocentre used to be . Due to impending construction at the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum , the contract was not renewed in late 2002 , and the Children 's Own Museum has been looking for a new location ever since . During its three @-@ year tenure in that building , it hosted nearly a half @-@ million visitors . The institution still exists , though it currently ( as of 2009 ) has no physical home . It is currently seeking suitable space to use in future endeavours . In the meantime the organization has participated in various children 's events around the city . 
 Later in 2002 , a traveling exhibit of costumes , props and models used in the making of Peter Jackson 's Lord of the Rings trilogy ran for four weeks at the planetarium . This was the last public exhibition housed in the building . Up until 2007 , the building has primarily served as office space and storage for exhibits that have been moved out of the R.O.M. while the Lee @-@ Chin Crystal wing was under construction . 
 Ever since the planetarium 's closing , there have been groups that have lobbied for its reopening . At first , efforts concentrated on reopening the existing facility , but in more recent years , the focus has shifted to establishing a wholly new permanent planetarium facility elsewhere in downtown Toronto . Smaller educational planetaria still exist in the Toronto region . At some time after 1995 , Seneca College closed their Roberta Bondar Earth and Space Centre planetarium . The Ontario Science Centre on Don Mills Road operates a high @-@ resolution digital planetarium with funding from CA , Inc . , and the Royal Ontario Museum also offers a small , portable , inflatable planetarium for school groups . 
 Since the closing , the Ontario Science Centre has taken over the McLaughlin Planetarium 's role as Toronto 's public planetarium , though using a much smaller facility . 
 = = = Planned redevelopment = = = 
 On April 14 , 2004 , the directors put out a call " for expressions of interest " to redevelop the space occupied by the planetarium . Seeking additional funding to cover the costs of the second phase of the expansion and redevelopment of the museum , the directors of the museum had planned on erecting luxury condominiums on the space currently occupied by the planetarium . This proposal was dropped on November 7 , 2005 , due to extensive public opposition to the construction of a tall residential building in a district of low @-@ rise public buildings . , though it was reported that R.O.M. director William <unk> was planning to revive the scheme to place a residential tower on the site . 
 On January 26 , 2009 the R.O.M. announced that it had sold the building and the site for $ 22 million to the University of Toronto , who originally planned to demolish the existing building and build additional facilities for its law and business faculties . 
 On September 9 , 2014 the University of Toronto announced a new museum and academic complex . It was to include the Jewish Museum of Canada , a Faculty of Music performance hall , research centres and History department academic space . In its early stages of planning and approvals the project lacked complete funding at the time of the announcement . In January 2016 , the university announced it would proceed with construction of what is now to be called the Centre for Civilizations and Cultures , without the participation of the Jewish Museum of Canada because the <unk> " needed to focus on more pressing funding priorities . " The project is to be designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro of New York in collaboration with <unk> of Toronto . The centre is to house the university 's Department of History , its Department of Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations , the Institute of Islamic Studies and the research arm for the Tanenbaum Centre for Jewish Studies , and a new 250 @-@ seat performance hall for the university 's Faculty of Music .

 " Take Back " ( stylized in Japan as <unk> BACK ) is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist Kumi Koda for her debut studio album , Affection ( 2002 ) . It was written by Kumi herself , while production was handled by Max Matsuura . The track was released following Koda 's participation in an open audition where she placed second , whereby she signed to Matsuura 's label to release this song . " Take Back " premiered on December 6 , 2000 as her debut recording . Musically , the track has been described as a pop and R & B song . 
 Upon its release , " Take Back " garnered positive reviews from music critics and was praised for its composition and commercial appeal . It also achieved limited success in her native Japan , with it peaking at number 59 on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart and number 63 on the TBS Count Down TV chart ; this marks her lowest entry to date and her only single to miss the top fifteen on that chart . Remixed by American producer and DJ Jonathan Peters for its North American release , " Take Back " reached number 18 on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart , number 10 on the US Hot Dance Music / Maxi @-@ Singles Sales and number 20 on the US Hot Singles Sales chart , making her the first Japanese act to chart on any US Billboard chart since the 1980s . 
 An accompanying music video for " Take Back " was shot in both Tokyo and New York City by Toku ; it features Kumi singing while sitting on a white chair and her lying down nude clutching a microphone in her hand . For promotion , the song was included on the track list of several concert tours , including Best : First Things Live Tour , Black Cherry Tour and her 10th Anniversary Tour . " Take Back " has only appeared once on any of Kumi 's compilation albums , Best : First Things ( 2005 ) .

 In 2000 , Kumi auditioned for the Avex Trax open " Dream Audition " and came second out of a total of 120 @,@ 000 participants . Following this , Avex employed Japanese producer Max Matsuura , known for his collaborations with fellow female Japanese artists Ayumi Hamasaki and Namie Amuro , to start the Avex Trax @-@ sub label , Rhythm Zone , in 1999 and eventually signed her to the label later that year . Her label had hired composer and arranger Kazuhito Kikuchi to compose " Take Back " , but Avex instructed Kumi to take singing lessons every weekend in Tokyo before recording it . At that time , she stated that she didn 't feel " anxious " about the situation , having already spent 500 @,@ 000 yen ( approximately $ <unk> USD ) she won from the open audition towards food . 
 In mid 2000 , Kumi was asked by Avex to make her promotional debut through a photo shoot with photographer Toku , which led to the shooting of the cover sleeve for " Take Back " . The artwork features her sporting a red and gold outfit , standing outside of a lit @-@ up tunnel . Particularly , Kumi said that " during the shooting of the cover for [ her ] single , ' Take Back ' , no one had told [ her ] what the shoot was for , so [ she ] just stood in front of the camera clueless " .

 " Take Back " was written by Kumi and produced by Max Matsuura . It was released as Koda 's debut recording and the first single from her debut studio album , Affection ( 2002 ) , on 6 December 2000 . " Take Back " has been described as a soft pop and R & B song . During an interview , it was revealed that " Take Back " and her earlier works were strictly oriented to R & B music , as " Koda didn 't get into R & B until Avex signed her to its Rhythm Zone label [ ... ] " . At the earlier stages of creating " Take Back " and Affection , she only listened to Japanese music and stated that " [ she 's ] the sort who likes reading the lyrics , and Western music is in English , which [ she ] wasn 't very good at . If [ she ] wouldn 't understand it , [ she ] couldn 't sing it , even at karaoke , so [ she ] didn 't listen to it much . " After discovering fellow label mate , m @-@ <unk> , Kumi was inspired by his R & B work and wanted to emulate his style into her work , whereby Rhythm Zone asked her to listen to Western music to widen her musical influences . For the North American release , American DJ and producer Jonathan Peters remixed the single ; it was chosen by Rhythm Zone as the final remix for that country . According to Kumi , " [ they ] hadn 't really intended to release [ the remix ] , but remixes were all the rage then " . Particularly , Avex 's New York office confessed that they thought the remix would do well thought the club scene .

 " Take Back " received favorable reviews from music critics . Krzysztof Figlerowicz from Jame World was positive towards the track in his review , labelling it as " a very pleasant soft pop and R & B song " . Furthermore , he noted that the composition was more suitable with the American audience than the Japanese scene hence the lack of success and " commercial appeal " in the latter region . A writer for CD Journal praised " Take Back " , commending its R & B composition as " impressive " and praised the songs longevity . A reviewer from Yahoo ! Music Japan <unk> Koda 's biography profile and commented that the mixture of R & B and pop music was a " perfect balance of contemporary charm and vocals " . Despite not commenting over the original or Jonathan Peter 's remix , Adam Greenberg from Allmusic reviewed the Sunset in Ibiza remix from her compilation album , Koda Kumi Driving Hit 's ( 2006 ) , and stated : " When the DJs complement her voice just right , Koda can sound like any number of other singers . [ ... ] " Real Emotion " and " Take Back " come out as something very similar to Ayumi Hamasaki 's works , "

 Upon its release , Kumi felt that she " feared the success of the single in Japan " . She also stated that she " was insecure " of the singles ' first week and debut sales . " Take Back " debuted at number 62 on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart with over 4 @,@ 000 units sold in its first week ; it later reached number 59 in its third week on the top 100 . It remains Koda 's lowest charting singles on the Oricon Singles Chart and her only single to miss the top fifty .

 The accompanying music video for " Take Back " was directed by Toku . It took one day to shoot and two days to edit . According to Figlerowicz in his extended review of her DVD release , 7 Spirits , the video opens with a " young Koda Kumi that has long and black hair . She presents herself in this video in two different ways . In the first one , though wearing a leather dress , she looks natural , gentle and pretty . In the latter one , she is presented with disheveled hair and strange things plaited in it , but despite that , she still attracts the viewer 's attention with her enthusiasm flowing out from the screen . " In the video , Kumi is accompanied by her three fellow background dancers ; they 're dancing in a white photo shoot room , while she is sitting in a white chair . Figlerowicz stated that the dancers complimented the early 2000s music video era : " there are only three dancers near the singer , so it probably wouldn 't distinguish from other <unk> of the same era . " Scenes interspersed through the main video show Koda lying nude on a crimson red Ferrari and clutching a microphone in her hand .

 = Tropical Storm Cindy ( 1993 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Cindy was a weak but unusually wet Atlantic tropical cyclone that caused disastrous floods and mudslides across Martinique in August 1993 . Forming east of the island , Cindy became the annual hurricane season 's third named storm on August 14 . Due to unfavorable atmospheric conditions , the storm remained disorganized throughout its journey across the northeastern Caribbean Sea . After attaining maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) , Cindy began to weaken from interaction with the high terrain of Hispaniola . It made landfall in the Dominican Republic as a tropical depression on August 16 , and dissipated over the territory the following day . 
 Despite its poor cloud and wind structure , Cindy dropped torrential rain over portions of the northeastern Caribbean . The island of Martinique received a record 12 inches ( 305 mm ) of rain over a 24 @-@ hour period , affecting many northern villages and communes . Le Prêcheur in particular was devastated by an extensive debris flow , which washed away entire structures . The disaster left two people dead and hundreds homeless on the island , and wrought $ 19 million ( 1993 USD ) in damage . En route to Hispaniola , Cindy affected the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with rough surf and moderate rain . Heavy downpours and flooding killed two people in the Dominican Republic , though the exact extent of the damage there is unknown . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Tropical Storm Cindy can be traced to a tropical wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August 8 , 1993 . Over the following days , the wave tracked steadily west @-@ northwestward across the tropical Atlantic while retaining a distinct cloud pattern on satellite images . Although initial data from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on August 13 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation , a second mission at 1200 UTC the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at the lower levels of the atmosphere . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) thus classified the system as a tropical depression — a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than 39 mph ( 62 km / h ) — and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter . 
 Steered by a mid- to low @-@ level wind flow , the depression decreased in forward speed and continued west @-@ northwest toward Martinique . Satellite images showed the development of a central dense overcast , and reconnaissance soon revealed that wind speeds near the center had increased to gale force . Based on this , the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Cindy at 1800 UTC on August 14 , at which time the cyclone was located over Martinique with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km ) . Although Cindy briefly developed a favorable outflow , its upper @-@ level structure debilitated after it moved away from the Lesser Antilles , preventing further development . Over the course of August 15 , Cindy 's cloud pattern remained disorganized due to unfavorable wind shear ; the center of circulation became ill defined , with the strongest thunderstorms confined to the eastern portion of the cyclone . Despite the unfavorable conditions , the storm managed to strengthen marginally on August 16 , attaining its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 1007 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 74 inHg ) , roughly 85 mi ( 140 km ) southeast of Santo Domingo . 
 Shortly after peaking in strength , Cindy began to interact with the mountains of nearby Hispaniola . The high terrain disrupted its circulation , causing it to weaken to a tropical depression around 2100 UTC on August 16 . The depression made landfall near Barahona , Dominican Republic , with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . It became increasingly disorganized over land , prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone on August 17 . The remnants proceeded inland near the border with Haiti and emerged into the Atlantic , where they spread across the Bahamas before eventually dissipating the next day . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 When Cindy became a tropical cyclone on August 14 , tropical storm warnings were issued for the Lesser Antilles from Martinique northward to the Virgin Islands . A tropical storm watch was posted for Puerto Rico at the time . The warnings , excluding those for the Virgin Islands , were discontinued on August 15 . As Cindy drifted further north later that day , the watch for Puerto Rico was upgraded to a tropical storm warning . Officials issued flash flood warnings for parts of the island , and about 600 people living in flood @-@ prone areas sought shelter ahead of the storm . Ferry service between Fajardo and the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques was suspended , leaving about 400 passengers stranded for a day . A price freeze was placed on emergency supplies such as wood , nails , batteries , kerosene , and lanterns . 
 Also on August 15 , a tropical storm warning was issued for the Dominican Republic , from Samaná to Cabo Engaño along the northern coast and westward to Isla Beata off the southwestern coast . Thousands of residents stocked up on bottled water , canned goods , and gas , though stores in and around the capital remained closed for the day . The Santo Domingo International Airport suspended all flight operations on the morning of August 16 . The tropical storm warning for the island was discontinued when Cindy made landfall as no more than a weak tropical depression . In Cuba , a storm alert was issued for eastern provinces as forecasters warned of possible heavy rainfall .

 On August 14 , Cindy passed over Martinique with rough winds and particularly violent rain . The greatest quantities fell to the northeast of a line between Sainte @-@ Marie and Fort @-@ de @-@ France , with day totals of more than 4 in ( 100 mm ) recorded at every weather station in that region . The highest 1- and 24 @-@ hour rainfall rates were observed in Le Prêcheur , totaling 5 @.@ 79 in ( 147 mm ) and 12 @.@ 0 in ( 305 mm ) , respectively . These amounts were well above the September average of 9 @.@ 29 in ( 236 mm ) , making Cindy one of the most extreme rain events in the island 's history . A maximum gust of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) was recorded during the storm , though sustained winds onshore did not reach tropical storm force . 
 Initially , Cindy 's brisk winds downed banana trees and power lines across northern Martinique . After hours of continued rain , several rivers — such as the Rivière des <unk> , Rivière Claire and Rivière <unk> — quickly swelled and overflowed . Heavy flooding and mudslides swept through northern villages , submerging homes and destroying roads and bridges . News footage on national television showed " cars [ being ] swept away to sea and buried in mud " . The Prêcheur River , which normally flows at 18 ft3 / s ( 0 @.@ 5 m3 / s ) , burst its banks upon attaining an exceptional discharge rate of nearly 25 @,@ 000 ft3 / s ( 700 m3 / s ) . Large amounts of volcanic matter from the riverbed congealed into a massive debris flow that struck the small commune of Le Prêcheur . Reaching heights of up to 10 ft ( 3 m ) , the debris completely covered houses and roads and wreaked an estimated ₣ 15 million ( 1993 value ; $ 2 @.@ 7 million in 1993 USD ) in structural damage . Flash floods following the overflow of the Grande Rivière surged through the adjacent village of the same name , devastating property and drowning one person . Despite recent improvements to its flood defenses , the Rivière <unk> rapidly topped its banks and inundated much of Saint @-@ Pierre . Farther south , a combination of torrential rainfall and poor storm drains resulted in widespread flood damage to private property and an <unk> in Le Morne @-@ Vert . 
 In all , Cindy killed 2 people , injured 11 , and destroyed more than 150 homes across Martinique . Monetary losses reached ₣ 107 million ( $ 19 million ) , with road damage pinned at ₣ 68 million ( $ 12 million ) . After the storm 's passage , thousands of people on the island sought refuge in emergency shelters , and about 3 @,@ 000 residents became homeless . La <unk> , a French Navy ship stationed in French Guiana , delivered disaster relief supplies to Fort @-@ de @-@ France ; the goods included 250 packages with clothing items , distributed by the Lions Club Association of Saint Barthélemy . Unseasonable sea conditions in Cindy 's wake temporarily hindered local fishers from selling their catch to trading vessels in Petite Martinique . Due to the severity of the flooding in Martinique , waterways and harbors were dredged and river banks and dykes were reinforced to prevent recurrence . 
 Minimal effects were felt elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles . In Guadeloupe , the storm dropped rain across southern Basse @-@ Terre Island through August 14 – 15 ; a peak total of 9 @.@ 02 in ( 229 mm ) was recorded at the summit of La Grande Soufrière . Wind gusts at <unk> Airport reached 38 mph ( 61 km / h ) , just below tropical storm force . Moderate breeze embedded with gusts to 28 mph ( 44 km / h ) brushed Dominica , and 1 @.@ 25 in ( 32 mm ) of rain fell at Canefield Airport within 24 hours of Cindy 's passage . Further south , a weather station in Saint Lucia recorded 1 @.@ 88 in ( 48 mm ) of precipitation , as well as light winds . As Cindy passed south of the Virgin Islands , unsettled seas and minor beach erosion affected the islands ' southern shores , with swells of 4 to 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 5 m ) reported at Saint Croix . Onshore , the island experienced wind gusts to 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) and 1 @.@ 48 in ( 38 mm ) of rainfall . 
 = = = Greater Antilles = = = 
 On August 16 , Cindy made its closest point of approach to Puerto Rico , although its center remained well south of the island . Impact from the storm was thus limited to intermittent downpours and 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) waves along the southern coast . The rough seas caused some minor erosion to beach facilities . According to a report from the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) , a maximum of 5 @.@ 54 in ( 141 mm ) of rain fell near Río Cerrillos in Ponce , though the highest measurement from the Weather Prediction Center ( WPC ) was 4 @.@ 60 in ( 117 mm ) at Puerto Real in Cabo Rojo . Many other locations received rainfall amounts of 2 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 5 in ( 50 – 115 mm ) , which flooded some roads and low @-@ lying areas . 
 Cindy brought considerable rainfall to southern and eastern parts of the Dominican Republic , with totals of 4 – 10 in ( 100 – 255 mm ) . Upon the storm 's landfall in the country , winds reached 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) in Barahona . The rain filled rivers and caused scattered street flooding , affecting hundreds of houses . In Villa Altagracia , one fatality occurred when a child drowned in flood waters ; the final death toll for the country stood at two . There were no reports of damage elsewhere after Cindy 's rapid demise over Hispaniola , though it is likely that the remnants produced localized showers in Haiti . 
 = Asia League Ice Hockey = 
 Asia League Ice Hockey ( <unk> ) is an association which operates a professional ice hockey league based in Far East ( East Asia and Russian Far East ) , with nine teams from Japan , China , Russia and South Korea . The league is headquartered in Japan . At the end of the playoffs every year the winner is awarded the Championship Trophy . 
 The league was formed in 2003 due to declining popularity in the Japan Ice Hockey League and the folding of the Korea Ice Hockey League . It was formed with the goal of promoting hockey and developing players ' skills . The league initially comprised five teams in two countries . It expanded to highs of four countries ( 2004 – 05 season ) and nine teams ( 2005 – 06 season ) and it comprised eight teams from three countries in the 2013 – 14 season . Prior to the 2014 – 15 season a team from Yuzhno @-@ Sakhalinsk , HC Sakhalin , was affiliated to the league . 
 The league draws most of its players from the home countries of its teams . However , to help build skill and raise the level of competitiveness the league allows each team a certain number of foreign imports on their roster . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 2003 – 2008 = = = 
 The league was formed after the collapse of the Korean ice hockey league and dissolution of the Japanese league . It was started with the goal of promoting hockey in Asia as well as helping the various participating countries develop their hockey programs and increase their showing in the Olympics . The first season was a shortened season of only five teams , and played as a tournament rather than a regular season . Four Japanese teams and a Korean team participated . The tournament lasted just two months and each team played four games , two at home and two away , against each other . Due to the shortened tournament format , there were no playoffs and the winner was declared from the point tally . The Nippon Paper Cranes won the tournament with 39 <unk> and Joel Prpic from Kokudo was the assist and points leader with 25 assists and 33 points . Ryan Haruo <unk> , of the Cranes , was the scoring leader with 15 goals . 
 The 2004 – 05 season was the first full season for the league , and was seen by some to be the inaugural season . Before the season began , there was already interest by the National Hockey League ( NHL ) in China 's hockey program . In addition to the five teams which took part in the tournament the year before , the league added Golden Amur from Russia as well as Harbin and Qiqihar from China . The first season had a schedule of 42 games . Teams played each other six times during the season . In December 2004 there was speculation by the South Korean media that North Korea could potentially field a team in the league , but that never materialized . The league also had an all @-@ star game which took place on 22 and 23 January 2005 in Kushiro . The league was broken up into two teams , the Blue Orion and Red Antares . Fans voted on their favorite players and coaches . The most popular vote was for the forward position on the Blue Orion which received over 45 @,@ 000 votes . Masatoshi Ito received the most votes with <unk> . The skill competition and game were both won by the Blue Orion . The regular season finished with the Nippon Paper Cranes and Kokudo both having 98 points . After applying the league 's tie @-@ breaking procedure , the Nippon Paper Cranes were ranked first . The Nippon Paper Cranes also won the points race holding the top three spots in goals scored with Masatoshi Ito taking top honours at 33 goals . Darcy <unk> , also from the Cranes , took top spot in assists with 44 and points with 69 . The playoffs saw the top four teams advance . The Golden Amur were swept in three games by Kokudo and the Cranes beat the Oji Paper in a close series , three games to one . The final was between the Cranes and Kokudo . While the Cranes won the first game , Kokudo won three games straight and won the playoffs . Chris Yule of Kokudo acquired ten points in the playoffs to lead the league while Chris Lindberg of the Cranes led the league in goals scored with six . Several players from Kokudo and the Cranes all had five assists . The 2005 <unk> Awards were held in Tokyo and announced in April . Among the awards Kikuchi Naoya a goaltender for Kokudo was voted Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) and Matsuda Keisuke of the <unk> Ice Bucks was voted Young Guy of the Year . 
 The 2005 – 06 season saw a number of changes to the make @-@ up of Asia League . In the off @-@ season , the Golden Amur withdrew from the league due to financial trouble . At the same time it was announced that Kangwon Land was showing interest in entering a team in the league . However , only a few weeks later , they withdrew their application because it was felt their team wasn 't strong enough to enter the league . The league also revised the limits on the number of imports some teams were allowed to have . Halla and the Ice Bucks were both allowed to carry an additional import player while the two Chinese teams were permitted two more import players . It was announced in July 2005 that Anyang Halla Winia would change their name to Anyang Halla . In late July , the league announced that Kangwon Land had acquired some imports and strengthened the team . They had applied again and were expected to enter the league that season . As well another new team , the Nordic Vikings , was expected to join the league . The Nordic Vikings were a Swedish @-@ Chinese joint venture that saw the team based in Beijing . As part of the venture , Swedish players were also sent to the two existing Chinese teams . This brought the league to its high point of nine teams . Even though there were more teams than in the previous season the league reduced the number of games from 42 to 38 , which resulted in an uneven schedule . For example , the Korean teams played nine games against each other , while playing four games against the teams from Japan and China except the Nordic Vikings , whom they played five times . At the end of the regular season , the Nippon Paper Cranes had captured first place for a second year in a row with 95 points . While the Cranes had a very strong showing in the point rankings , the top goal scorer was Song Dong @-@ hwan from Anyang Halla with 31 . Derek Plante led in assists with 47 and overall points with 75 . The top six teams advanced to the playoffs with the top two teams , the Cranes and Halla , receiving a bye to the semi @-@ finals . In the first round , Kokudo swept the Ice Bucks while Oji Paper defeated the Vikings three games to one . In the second round Kokudo faced Halla , who were making their playoff debut . Kokudo won that series three games to one . On the other side , the Cranes faced off against Oji Paper and swept them in three games . The final was again the Cranes vs Kokudo and once again Kokudo emerged victorious , claiming the title for the second year in a row . Kokudo had three players claiming the three top points spots for the playoffs . Joel Prpic was the top goal scorer with nine , Kiyoshi Fujita had the most assists with 12 and Takahito Suzuki had the most points with 18 . Kikuchi Naoya won MVP of the year for the second time and Young Guy of the Year went to <unk> Nishiwaki of the Cranes . 
 Further changes were seen in the league in the 2006 – 07 season . After the last season The Nordic Vikings were looking for sponsors for the team . However , they failed to find sufficient sponsorship and left the league due to financial trouble . Harbin moved their home rink to Beijing and changed their name to Hosa to reflect this . Qiqihar acquired a new sponsor and changed their name to Changchun <unk> . Kokudo also changed their name to the Seibu Prince Rabbits . With eight teams , the league further reduced the number of games played to 34 , which again resulted in an uneven play schedule . The Chinese @-@ based teams , for example , played each other and the Korean teams each six times but only played the Japanese teams four times . The Paper Cranes easily won the regular season again finishing first with 86 points . With the previous year 's goal leader not participating the scoring race went to Tim Smith of Kangwon Land . He led the league with 30 goals . Patrik Martinec of Halla led the league with 53 assists and 71 points . The playoffs followed the same format as the year before and six teams advanced . Kangwon Land swept Halla in three games and Oji Paper beat the Ice Bucks three games to one . While it was inevitable with two Korean teams facing each other , it marks the first time a non @-@ Japanese team won a playoff series in Asia League . The second round was over quickly as the Cranes and Rabbits who both had byes swept their opponents in three games each . For the third year in a row the final was between the Paper Cranes and the Rabbits . The Cranes took the series in four games . Joel Prpic won himself another scoring title as he led the playoffs in goals , 8 , and points , 17 . Kengo Itoh for the Cranes had the most assists with 13 . At the awards ceremony Itoh also took the award for MVP of the Year while Jun <unk> received the award for Young Guy of the Year . 
 The 2007 – 08 season started with a further reduction in teams . Harbin and Qiqihar combined into a single team and became owned and operated by the San Jose Sharks . They took the name of their new owner and became the China Sharks . Kangwon Land renamed to High1 . With only seven teams , the league reduced the number of games played to its lowest at just 30 games . The league continued with an unbalanced schedule and the Korean and Chinese teams played each other more than the Japanese teams did . After three years of dominance , the Nippon Paper Cranes slipped to fourth place and the regular season was won by the Prince Rabbits . Alex Kim , playing for High1 , recorded the most goals with 23 and most points with 51 . Joel Prpic continued to find himself on top of the pack with 30 assists . With six of seven teams going to the playoffs , the Sharks were the only team that didn 't find themselves in a playoff spot . The first round was over quickly as the Cranes swept Halla in three games and Oji did the same to the Ice Bucks . Nippon faced their rivals , the Rabbits , in the second round and defeated them three to one . High1 couldn 't repeat their success from the previous year by winning a series and were swept by Oji in three games . For the first time , the final series was not between the Cranes and Rabbits . Oji continued to roll over their opponents and swept the Cranes , marking the only time a team in Asia League had swept its way through three rounds . Due to their dominance on the ice , the point race was also swept by Oji . Takeshi Saito led the playoffs with nine assists and 15 points , while Shane Endicott had the most goals with 6 . Kunihiko Sakurai , also from Oji , won the MVP of the Year and <unk> Hyun @-@ <unk> , from High1 , won the Young Guy of the Year award . 
 = = = 2008 – present = = = 
 After several years of many changes to the teams , the 2008 – 09 season came with only one change . Oji Paper renamed themselves to Oji Eagles in July 2008 . The league increased China 's allowance to seven import players to help their competitiveness . Prior to the start of the regular season a series of exhibition games , dubbed " Anyang Cup 2008 " was held in Anyang . Five of the seven teams in the league participated with the Ice Bucks and Rabbits sitting out . Oji won the exhibition tournament without losing a game . The league increased the amount of games played to 36 and balanced the schedule by having all teams play each other an equal amount . Early in the season the Halla coach , Shim Eui @-@ sik was suspended for refusal to play after a disputed goal against High1 . Halla was forced to forfeit the game , but at the end of the regular season they had finished in first place with 76 points , becoming the first non @-@ Japanese team to do so . Brock Radunske of Halla finished first in goals and points with 29 and 57 respectively . Kunihiko Sakurai , a previous MVP , finished on top with 40 assists in the regular season . The league reduced the number of teams making the playoffs and only five teams advanced . The first round saw a short three games series between the Cranes and High1 . The Cranes swept High1 in two games . The second round found the regular season winners , Halla , facing the Cranes and Oji facing the Rabbits . Halla and the Cranes took it to seven games , but Halla lost on home ice . After the previous year 's record setting playoff run , Oji found themselves swept by the Rabbits in four games . For the fourth time in five years the final was between the Rabbits and Cranes . The Cranes won for the second time . The Cranes swept the playoffs point race with Kengo Itoh taking the lead with 16 assists and 21 points . <unk> Nishiwaki led with 12 goals . Brock Radunske took the award for MVP of the Year marking the first time the award has gone to an import player . Young Guy of the Year went to Kim Ki @-@ sung , also from Halla . 
 After a season with little change to the make @-@ up of the league , the 2009 – 10 saw further change . The San Jose Sharks ended their association with the Chinese team . They pulled out all coaches and players they had sent . The Chinese Ice Hockey Association took over the team and brought in new import players and coaches to replace those lost . The team also changed its name from China Sharks to China Dragon . Mid @-@ way through the previous season the Seibu Prince Rabbits announced that due to financial difficulties they would withdraw from the league at the end of the 2008 – 09 season . They were unable to find a buyer and the team folded . However , another team from Japan joined the league in the off @-@ season . The Tohoku Free Blades were able to hire enough players and imports to join the league in time for the beginning of the season . This again left the league with seven teams . The league left the amount of games played at 36 , marking the first time that the league didn 't adjust the schedule from the previous year . The league also introduced a couple of rules changes . All face @-@ offs will take place on one of the nine face @-@ off dots as well teams will no longer be allowed to change after an icing . Anyang Halla repeated as the regular season champions finishing with 79 points and 23 wins . The team also set the record for the most goals by a team in a 36 @-@ game season with 180 . Alex Kim and Tim Smith lead the points race . Both finished with 75 points on the season , with Kim taking the goal scoring race with 29 and Smith taking the assists race with 48 . The League further reduced the amount of teams making the playoffs to only four . As well they brought in referees from outside the league to assist in officiating . The two Korean teams faced each other in one semi @-@ final guaranteeing for the first time that a Korean team would appear in the final . Halla defeated High1 in four games after a loss on home ice . The Cranes similarly defeated the Eagles in four games . The final was a close series , needing all five games and with four of the five games only being decided by a single goal . In the final game , Halla tied the game with 17 seconds remaining and in over @-@ time the team captain , Kim Woo @-@ jae scored to give Halla a victory and mark the first time a non @-@ Japanese team had won the cup . In the play @-@ offs Brock Radunske led with six goals and 13 points overall while Darcy Takeshi <unk> led with 8 assists . Patrik Martinec took regular season MVP honors , and Cho Min @-@ ho , also from Halla , was named Young Guy of the Year . 
 The 2010 – 11 season saw virtually no change to the structure of the season or league . All teams from the previous season remained in the league , and the amount of games remained at 36 . The regular season ran from 18 September 2010 to 20 February 2011 . After two years of leading the league , Halla slipped to fourth place and Oji Eagles took the regular season honors with 76 points . <unk> Kuji of Oji lead the league with 24 goals , while his teammate Yosuke Kon led with 45 assists . However , with a couple of second @-@ place finishes , Go Tanaka of the Free Blades led the overall points race with 59 . The League also maintained the number of play @-@ off teams at four . Anyang faced Oji while Nippon faced Tohoku . Halla managed to take two of three in Japan and defeat Oji on home ice to advance . The Free Blades needed all five games to defeat the Cranes but the team came back with two straight wins to advance to the final for the first time in their short time in the league . However , a 9 @.@ 0 magnitude earthquake near the Free Blades hometown forced the League to cancel the finals . Halla had already in Japan just an hour before the disaster struck the area . Fortunately , both teams survived , but the League felt the final could not go on . On 22 March 2011 the League declared that both Halla and the Free Blades would be declared co @-@ champions . Though shortened , Masato <unk> of Oji led the playoffs with four goals , Bruce <unk> led with six assists and fellow Free Blade Brad <unk> had eights points overall . 
 In 2013 – 14 , a new Seoul @-@ based team , <unk> <unk> , joined the league , and prior to the 2014 – 15 season a team from Yuzhno @-@ Sakhalinsk , HC Sakhalin , was affiliated to the league .

 = = Game = = 
 Each Asia League Ice Hockey regulation game is an ice hockey game played between two teams and is 60 minutes long . The game comprises three 20 @-@ minute periods separated by two 15 minute intermissions . While some teams have television broadcast contracts , they do not take television time @-@ outs like the NHL . At the end of the 60 minute game , the team with the most goals wins . If the game is tied at the end of 60 minutes , the teams play an overtime period . Overtime is five minutes , with four skaters on each team . If the game remains tied after five minutes , then the teams partake in a three player shoot @-@ out , until one team comes out ahead . Prior to the 2008 – 09 season these games ended in a tie with no shoot @-@ out . In a playoff game the league doesn 't use the shoot @-@ out and instead the teams play continual overtime periods of 20 minutes until one team scores . 
 = = Imports = = 
 Asia League was created primarily for the development of hockey in Asia . The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league . Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the participating countries to increase their skills and benefit from having some more experienced players on their teams . China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest . As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks , and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league . 
 Several former National Hockey League players have played in the league , including Chris Allen , Greg Parks , Esa Tikkanen , Chris Lindberg , Tavis Hansen , <unk> <unk> , Jason <unk> , Derek Plante , Steve McKenna , Jarrod <unk> , Joel Prpic , Tyson Nash , Jamie McLennan , Shane Endicott , Wade Flaherty , Kelly Fairchild , Brad <unk> , Ricard Persson , Bryan Young , Claude Lemieux , Brad Fast , Ric Jackman and Cole Jarrett . 
 = = Teams = = 
 Early in its existence the league hoped to quickly expand to 12 teams but due to some teams having financial difficulties they didn 't attain it . In its 2014 – 15 season , the Asia League Ice Hockey has 9 teams , comprising 4 teams from Japan ; 3 teams from South Korea ; 1 from Russia ; and 1 from China . 
 = = Season structure = = 
 The Asia League Ice Hockey season is divided into three parts . The late summer and early autumn parts consist of training camps and exhibition play . After that , the regular season takes place , which lasts for several months depending on the schedule . Finally several teams advance to a post @-@ season playoff . This is an elimination tournament where teams play a " best @-@ of " format to advance through the rounds . The final remaining team is crowned the champion for the year . 
 The regular season has been changed in almost every season that Asia League has been in operation . The first full season mirrors the two most recent seasons in which all teams play all other teams six times . With the amount of teams changing from season to season in the first few years the league adjusted the schedule each year which often included an unbalanced schedule . Under the current schedule all teams make an away visit to each other team 's home rink for a three @-@ game series and also play a three @-@ game series against that team at their own home rink . In order to minimize travel , teams traveling to other countries will stay there for two weeks and play two teams , except in the case of China who only has one team . Teams going to Japan will play against the Cranes and Eagles on the same trip as they are geographically close together , then in another trip play against the Free Blades and Ice Bucks . 
 The league ranks the teams by points . A regulation time win is worth three points . If the teams are tied at the end of regulation , both teams receive one point . The team which is victorious either in the overtime period or overtime shoot @-@ out receives an additional point . A regulation time loss is worth zero points . 
 At the end of the regular season , the team which has the most points is awarded the title of regular season champion . The league in the past generally takes a several week break between the regular season and postseason . As with the regular season , the format of the playoffs has varied from year to year . In the 2009 – 10 season the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and play two best @-@ of @-@ five rounds . The league scheduled the end of the regular season and postseason around the Olympic break . In each round the higher ranked team from the regular season will receive a home @-@ ice advantage and the series will begin play and have the majority of games play in their rink . 
 = = Awards = = 
 Asia League awards several awards each season in addition to The Championship Trophy . Prior to the 2008 – 09 season the awards were issued after the postseason but in that season they were issued during the break between the regular season and postseason . The league presents awards for :

 = Sonic Lost World = 
 Sonic Lost World is an action @-@ adventure / platform video game developed by Sonic Team for the Wii U , Nintendo 3DS and PC platforms . It was published by Nintendo in Europe and Australia and Sega in North America and Japan in October 2013 , and later worldwide for Microsoft Windows via Steam in November 2015 . It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series and was the first title in the series on an eighth @-@ generation home console . 
 Lost World focuses on the efforts of Sonic the Hedgehog to stop the Deadly Six , an alien tribe that serves as the game 's main antagonists , as they seek to siphon energy from the Lost Hex , the game 's setting . Sonic and his long @-@ time sidekick Tails must team up with Doctor Eggman , normally their enemy , to stop the Deadly Six , leading to conflicts among the three parties . While the gameplay is typical of the Sonic series in some ways , it adds parkour mechanics and features largely cylindrical level design with an emphasis on alternate pathways . The game also features the Wisp creatures from Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations as power @-@ ups . 
 The game began development shortly after the 2010 release of Sonic Colors . It was designed to be streamlined , simple , and fluid in movement and design , using a novel tube @-@ like level design style and a simple , bright color scheme . The game received mixed reviews upon release ; its controls and the Deadly Six were frequently criticized , but its visuals and audio were seen positively . Downloadable content was released both alongside and after the game 's release , adding features such as additional levels and a new type of Wisp power . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Sonic Lost World is a platform game with action @-@ adventure elements , in which the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog as he travels across the Lost Hex in order to rescue captured animals and stop the Deadly Six . Levels range from side @-@ scrolling 2D levels to fast @-@ moving 3D linear levels to levels taking place on spherical worlds similar to the cancelled Sonic X @-@ treme and the Super Mario Galaxy series . This also translates to the 3DS version , as it was the first handheld game in the series presented entirely in 3D . 
 The game uses a new control system which allows players to control Sonic 's speed . Simply moving the directional controls will move Sonic at a moderate pace , allowing for more precision . Holding down a trigger button will put Sonic into a run , allowing him to move faster and perform new parkour moves , such as running up and along walls and hopping over smalls ledges . In the air , Sonic can perform a double jump , which returns from Sonic Colors , a homing attack , which can now target multiple enemies in quick succession , and a new kick attack , which can be used to defeat stronger enemies , or knock them into others . 
 Also returning from Colors are the Wisp creatures , which provide short @-@ lived power @-@ ups to Sonic . The Wisps ' powers are now controlled using the Wii U GamePad 's touchscreen and gyroscopic features . Alongside returning powers such as Drill , Laser and Rocket , new powers include Eagle , which lets Sonic fly through the air , Asteroid , which <unk> objects in his path , and Rhythm , which lets him bounce along a path of notes . There are also some Wisps exclusive to each version of the game . During the game , players can rescue animals by destroying enemies or opening containers , allowing players to progress , or find Red Star Rings that open up circus @-@ themed bonus stages where players can earn more animals . Collecting all the Red Star Rings in the game unlocks the ability to transform into Super Sonic . 
 The Wii U version supports both co @-@ operative multiplayer , in which a second player can control a remote controlled vehicle to assist Sonic , and competitive multiplayer , in which a second player can use the Wii U Gamepad screen to race against the other player . The game also supports Miiverse and Off @-@ TV Play functionality . Using Miiverse , players can exchange items such as Wisps or shields , which grow more effective if they are used by other players . The 3DS version supports both local and online multiplayer for up to four players . Players may also customise RC vehicles in the 3DS version , which can then be used in the Wii U version .

 = = = Story = = = 
 Sonic the Hedgehog and his friend Tails pursue Doctor Eggman , who has captured several of their animal friends with the intention of using them to power his robot army . While the two attempt to retrieve a falling capsule filled with animals , Eggman shoots down Tails ' plane . However , they end up discovering a world in the sky known as the Lost Hex , and crash land there . Entering the Windy Hill Zone , Sonic and Tails make their way through clouds and the grassy fields . The duo then discover that Eggman has enlisted the aid of a group of the world 's indigenous Zeti race , collectively known as the Deadly Six , using a magical conch to keep them under his command . However , when Sonic rushes in and kicks the conch away , the Deadly Six betray Eggman and take control of his <unk> army . They then start to use one of Eggman 's machines to siphon energy from Sonic 's world below , planning to drain all of its life force until there is nothing left and use it to power themselves up . Reluctantly , Sonic agrees to work with Eggman , believing that he needs his help to stop the machine , though this seems to cause some distrust between him and Tails . 
 As Sonic battles his way throughout the Lost Hex , the Deadly Six concoct a plan to capture Sonic and turn him into a robot under their control , but they end up accidentally capturing Tails instead . After Eggman is seemingly killed , Sonic comes across the Deadly Six as they prepare to use the <unk> Tails against him . However , prior to the conversion , Tails managed to reprogram the process to retain his free will and instead helps Sonic to defeat them . Upon reaching the machine and finding it already switched off , Eggman reappears , having faked his death and used the energy harvested to power his latest giant mech . After sending Eggman falling out of the sky , Sonic and Tails return the stolen energy to the world below and return home . The game ends with <unk> and <unk> finding Eggman , who has survived his fall , and digging him out of a soft spot of dirt where he landed on .
