 Kepler @-@ 11g , the sixth planet of six from its star , it 's mass is estimated to be at most 25 times that of Earth .

As a result , only an upper limit can be placed on the mass , which is based on the assumption that if it were above this limit , gravitational effects on the other planets would be observed . Nonetheless , tighter constraints were placed on Kepler @-@ 11g 's mass by formation and evolution calculations , which indicated that the planet mass is not much greater than about 7 ME .

 = Regenbald = 
 Regenbald ( sometimes known as Regenbald of Cirencester ) was a priest and royal official in Anglo @-@ Saxon England under King Edward the Confessor . His name suggests that he was not a native Englishman , and perhaps was German or Norman . He first appears in history as a witness to a royal document in 1050 , and remained a royal chaplain and clerk throughout the rest of King Edward 's reign . Many royal documents give Regenbald the title of " chancellor " but whether this means that he acted in a manner similar to the later Lord Chancellor is unclear , as some of the documents may be forgeries or have been tampered with . Whatever Regenbald 's actual title , King Edward rewarded him with lands and also granted him the status , but not the actual office , of bishop . Regenbald continued to serve the English kings after the Norman Conquest of England , although whether he served King Harold II of England is unclear . His date of death is unknown , but it was probably during the reign of either King William I or William II . After his death , some of his lands became part of the endowment of Cirencester Abbey in 1133 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 His origins are unknown , but he was probably not a native Englishman . He may have been German or Norman . The historian Katharine Keats @-@ Rohan suggests that he was possibly the nephew of Peter , who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman . His name was a German or French name , which suggests that Regenbald was one of the foreigners that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor . 
 = = Service to Edward the Confessor = = 
 Regenbald first appears in the historical record in 1050 , when he witnesses a charter of King Edward . King Edward gave him large estates as a reward for his service to the king as a royal chaplain . The Domesday Book records him owning at least seven churches , but only two of them have any indication that he performed any ecclesiastical services personally . Another royal reward was the grant to Regenbald of the status , without the actual office , of a bishop . He probably was unable to be promoted to a bishopric , either because he was married or because his style of life was known to be unchaste . 
 In royal charters he is often given the title " royal chancellor " , as he is styled in a 1062 charter in Latin regis <unk> , but this does not necessarily mean that there was an official office known as chancellor similar to the later Lord Chancellor 's office . Regenbald was probably in charge of Edward 's royal clerks and scribes , but his position in the witness lists argues against his holding an actual office , as he is not listed early in the witness lists along with the magnates . He probably performed some of the duties that later were done by the chancellor , but the first chancellor in England is usually held to be <unk> , who held office from around 1069 . Some historians , including David Bates , hold that Regenbald was chancellor , however . Some support for that position is the fact that Domesday Book lists Regenbald as " chancellor " . The entire issue of whether Regenbald was a " true " chancellor or not is bound up in the debate amongst medievalists about whether there was a recognisable chancery in England prior to the Norman Conquest . One school of thought , led by Pierre Chaplais , argues that no such office existed prior to the Conquest . Another group argues that there was , and among this group is the historian Simon Keynes . In Regenbald 's case , a number of the documents that give him the title " chancellor " are either forgeries or have been altered in the copying process . Others , however , are not easily shown to be spurious . 
 Besides his scribal duties , he also served as a royal judge , as he is recorded as passing judgement in a case late in Edward 's or early in William 's reign , along with Wulfstan , Bishop of Worcester , and Æthelwig , Abbot of Evesham . A thirteenth @-@ century source says that he was dean of the church at Cirencester during William 's reign . 
 Regenbald remained at the royal court throughout Edward 's reign and into the reign of King William the Conqueror . His lands and possessions were confirmed by King William after the Norman Conquest . Whether he served King Harold in the period after King Edward 's death is unknown , as no royal charters and only one royal writ survive from Harold 's reign . 
 Regenbald 's lands are recorded in a charter from the reign of King Henry I of England which dealt with the gift of those lands after Regenbald 's death . This charter lists a number of estates as owned by Regenbald that were also listed in Domesday Book as Regenbald 's , but there are a few other possessions that did not get recorded in Domesday . The lands listed include lands in Gloucestershire , Berkshire , Wiltshire , Somerset , Northamptonshire , Worcestershire , and Dorset . Domesday lists the value of Regenbald 's lands at £ 40 per year . His estates totalled about 90 hides , although some of the estates were given to him after the Norman Conquest . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Presumably , he died either during the reign of William I or during the following reign of William II . Possibly , he was buried at Cirencester , where a stone tomb in the crypt of the Saxon @-@ era church still exists and may be his . After his death , a group of his lands became the basis for the foundation of Cirencester Abbey by King Henry I of England in 1133 . Regenbald 's brother held land near him in Cirencester . Regenbald had a son named Edward who also held lands in Gloucester . 
 = Elixir ( perfume ) = 
 Elixir is a women 's fragrance by Colombian singer songwriter Shakira , developed in a collaboration with international fashion company Puig . After the release of her first two fragrances , Puig enlisted several perfumers to work on Shakira 's third fragrance , which she claimed would capture her " most sensual and exotic side . " The final product was Elixir , an oriental perfume based on various spicy and woody sources . The flacon of the perfume is inspired by apothecary bottles and is made to resemble a magical potion , featuring a light golden colour scheme . 
 Shakira launched the fragrance at a press release in São Paulo , Brazil , in July 2012 . Additionally , Jaume de Laiguana directed a commercial for the fragrance , which was filmed in the Sahara desert in Morocco . In August 2013 , Wild Elixir was released as a flanker fragrance to Elixir . The floral oriental perfume is similar to the original one in appearance but features a variation in the colour scheme . It was promoted through a commercial which features Shakira encountering two cheetahs in an arid landscape .

 In 2008 , international fashion and fragrance company Puig announced that it had formed a partnership with Shakira and had signed an agreement " to develop a line of signature products produced with and inspired by the artist " . The first product to appear was S by Shakira , which was released in September 2010 , followed by S by Shakira Eau Florale . 
 After developing her first two fragrances , Puig began working on Shakira 's third perfume and enlisted Alexandra Kosinski and Sonia Constant , perfumers from Swiss fragrance manufacturer Givaudan , to collaborate with Elisabeth Vidal , a perfumer from Puig . Vidal had previously worked with Shakira on S by Shakira Eau Florale . The perfumers came up with the concept of a " second skin , " described by Shakira as a " fragrance that becomes a part of you . " In an interview with Women 's Wear Daily , the singer claimed that the scent would display her " most sensual and exotic side " and had seemingly been inspired by the deserts of Morocco .

 Elixir belongs to the oriental <unk> family , which is known to contain intense and long lasting fragrances . The top notes of the perfume were described by Shakira as " floral and spicy " and include neroli , white pepper , and white flower ; the heart notes were said to be " velvety and fruity " and are based on the scents of flowers like freesia and <unk> , and apricot ; the base notes contain amber , <unk> , musk , sugar cane and white cedar wood . The ingredients of the perfume are mostly based on spicy and woody elements which <unk> the sweeter floral elements . Shakira herself stated that the " sweetness " in Elixir was kept to a limited amount . 
 German packaging company <unk> was hired to produce the flacon of Elixir . It is made of clear moulded glass and has a slender gold @-@ tinted neck . According to Jose Manuel Albesa , chief brand officer of Puig , it is inspired by the bottles used in the historic medical practice of apothecary . In an interview with Latina , Shakira revealed that she wanted to " depict the kind of bottle that was used in ancient times , but that looked modern and chic as well " and come up with a design similar to a magical potion , which is the definition of the word ' elixir ' . As the scent is inspired by the desert , she chose the tint of the bottle to be golden so that it can " evoke the memories of sands and sunsets " . The packaging of the fragrance was designed by Colombian artist Catalina Estrada and features colourful illustrations of various birds and leaves printed on a pale background .

Elixir was released in approximately 19 @,@ 000 stores in the United States alone . Elsewhere , Elixir was released in Eastern Europe , Italy , and Latin America . The perfume was aimed at a younger demographic , according to Albesa . Elixir was made available as an eau de toilette , and its prices ranged from US $ 17 @.@ 50 to US $ 36 with respect to the size . 
 Shakira launched Elixir at a press release in São Paulo , Brazil , on 17 July 2012 , where she discussed her inspiration behind the fragrance and its development process . The commercial for the fragrance was shot in the Sahara desert in Morocco by Jaume de Laiguana , who had previously directed music videos for various songs by Shakira , like " Loca " and " Rabiosa " . The advertisement features Shakira in the middle of the desert wearing a long skirt ; she opens a bottle of Elixir and performs a dance routine , attracting an eagle towards her which perches on her arm . A competition was held on the official website of the perfume to determine a winner who would be rewarded the long skirt Shakira wore in the commercial .

 = M @-@ theory = 
 M @-@ theory is a theory in physics that unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory . The existence of such a theory was first conjectured by Edward Witten at a string theory conference at the University of Southern California in the spring of 1995 . Witten 's announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as the second superstring revolution . 
 Prior to Witten 's announcement , string theorists had identified five versions of superstring theory . Although these theories appeared at first to be very different , work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways . In particular , physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S @-@ duality and T @-@ duality . Witten 's conjecture was based in part on the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven @-@ dimensional supergravity . 
 Although a complete formulation of M @-@ theory is not known , the theory should describe two- and five @-@ dimensional objects called branes and should be approximated by eleven @-@ dimensional supergravity at low energies . Modern attempts to formulate M @-@ theory are typically based on matrix theory or the AdS / CFT correspondence . 
 According to Witten , M should stand for “ magic ” , “ mystery ” , or “ membrane ” according to taste , and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known . 
 Investigations of the mathematical structure of M @-@ theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics . More speculatively , M @-@ theory may provide a framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental forces of nature . Attempts to connect M @-@ theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four @-@ dimensional world , although so far none have been verified to give rise to physics as observed at , for instance , the Large Hadron Collider . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Quantum gravity and strings = = = 
 One of the deepest problems in modern physics is the problem of quantum gravity . The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity , which is formulated within the framework of classical physics . However , nongravitational forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics , a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability . A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics , but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity . 
 String theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics . In string theory , the point @-@ like particles of particle physics are replaced by one @-@ dimensional objects called strings . 
 String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other . In a given version of string theory , there is only one kind of string , which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string , and it can vibrate in different ways . On distance scales larger than the string scale , a string will look just like an ordinary particle , with its mass , charge , and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string . In this way , all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings . One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the <unk> , a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force . 
 There are several versions of string theory : type I , type IIA , type IIB , and two flavors of heterotic string theory ( SO ( 32 ) and E8 × E8 ) . The different theories allow different types of strings , and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries . For example , the type I theory includes both open strings ( which are segments with endpoints ) and closed strings ( which form closed loops ) , while types IIA and IIB include only closed strings . Each of these five string theories arises as a special limiting case of M @-@ theory . This theory , like its string theory predecessors , is an example of a quantum theory of gravity . It describes a force just like the familiar gravitational force subject to the rules of quantum mechanics . 
 = = = Number of dimensions = = = 
 In everyday life , there are three familiar dimensions of space : height , width and depth . Einstein 's general theory of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions ; in general relativity , space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four @-@ dimensional spacetime . In this framework , the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of the geometry of spacetime . 
 In spite of the fact that the universe is well described by four @-@ dimensional spacetime , there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions . In some cases , by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions , a theory becomes more mathematically tractable , and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily . There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics . Finally , there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection . 
 One notable feature of string theory and M @-@ theory is that these theories require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency . In string theory , spacetime is ten @-@ dimensional , while in M @-@ theory it is eleven @-@ dimensional . In order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories , one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments . 
 Compactification is one way of modifying the number of dimensions in a physical theory . In compactification , some of the extra dimensions are assumed to " close up " on themselves to form circles . In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small , one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions . A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose . If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance , it appears to have only one dimension , its length . However , as one approaches the hose , one discovers that it contains a second dimension , its circumference . Thus , an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Theories that arise as different limits of M @-@ theory turn out to be related in highly nontrivial ways . One of the relationships that can exist between these different physical theories is called S @-@ duality . This is a relationship which says that a collection of strongly interacting particles in one theory can , in some cases , be viewed as a collection of weakly interacting particles in a completely different theory . Roughly speaking , a collection of particles is said to be strongly interacting if they combine and decay often and weakly interacting if they do so infrequently . Type I string theory turns out to be equivalent by S @-@ duality to the SO ( 32 ) heterotic string theory . Similarly , type IIB string theory is related to itself in a nontrivial way by S @-@ duality . 
 Another relationship between different string theories is T @-@ duality . Here one considers strings propagating around a circular extra dimension . T @-@ duality states that a string propagating around a circle of radius R is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius 1 / R in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description . For example , a string has momentum as it propagates around a circle , and it can also wind around the circle one or more times . The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the winding number . If a string has momentum p and winding number n in one description , it will have momentum n and winding number p in the dual description . For example , type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T @-@ duality , and the two versions of heterotic string theory are also related by T @-@ duality . 
 In general , the term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical systems turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way . If two theories are related by a duality , it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory . The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation . Put differently , the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena . 
 = = = Supersymmetry = = = 
 Another important theoretical idea that plays a role in M @-@ theory is supersymmetry . This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions . Roughly speaking , fermions are the constituents of matter , while bosons mediate interactions between particles . In theories with supersymmetry , each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion , and vice versa . When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry , one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity . Such a theory is called a supergravity theory . 
 A theory of strings that incorporates the idea of supersymmetry is called a superstring theory . There are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M @-@ theory framework . At low energies , the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions . Similarly , M @-@ theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions . 
 = = = Branes = = = 
 In string theory and related theories such as supergravity theories , a brane is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher dimensions . For example , a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero , while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one . It is also possible to consider higher @-@ dimensional branes . In dimension p , these are called p @-@ branes . Branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics . They can have mass and other attributes such as charge . A p @-@ brane sweeps out a ( p + 1 ) -dimensional volume in spacetime called its <unk> . Physicists often study fields analogous to the electromagnetic field which live on the <unk> of a brane . The word brane comes from the word " membrane " which refers to a two @-@ dimensional brane . 
 In string theory , the fundamental objects that give rise to elementary particles are the one @-@ dimensional strings . Although the physical phenomena described by M @-@ theory are still poorly understood , physicists know that the theory describes two- and five @-@ dimensional branes . Much of the current research in M @-@ theory attempts to better understand the properties of these branes .

 = = = Kaluza – Klein theory = = = 
 In the early 20th century , physicists and mathematicians including Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski pioneered the use of four @-@ dimensional geometry for describing the physical world . These efforts culminated in the formulation of Einstein 's general theory of relativity , which relates gravity to the geometry of four @-@ dimensional spacetime . 
 The success of general relativity led to efforts to apply higher dimensional geometry to explain other forces . In 1919 , work by Theodor Kaluza showed that by passing to five @-@ dimensional spacetime , one can unify gravity and electromagnetism into a single force . This idea was improved by physicist Oskar Klein , who suggested that the additional dimension proposed by Kaluza could take the form of a circle with radius around 10 − 30 cm . 
 The Kaluza – Klein theory and subsequent attempts by Einstein to develop unified field theory were never completely successful . In part this was because Kaluza – Klein theory predicted a particle that has never been shown to exist , and in part because it was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron 's mass to its charge . In addition , these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics , which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism , as well as new nuclear forces that were being discovered throughout the middle part of the century . Thus it would take almost fifty years for the idea of new dimensions to be taken seriously again . 
 = = = Early work on supergravity = = = 
 New concepts and mathematical tools provided fresh insights into general relativity , giving rise to a period in the 1960s and 70s now known as the golden age of general relativity . In the mid @-@ 1970s , physicists began studying higher @-@ dimensional theories combining general relativity with supersymmetry , the so @-@ called supergravity theories . 
 General relativity does not place any limits on the possible dimensions of spacetime . Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions , one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field in any number of dimensions . <unk> is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of dimensions . In 1978 , work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven . In the same year , Eugene <unk> , Bernard Julia , and Joel <unk> of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions . 
 Initially , many physicists hoped that by compactifying eleven @-@ dimensional supergravity , it might be possible to construct realistic models of our four @-@ dimensional world . The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature : electromagnetism , the strong and weak nuclear forces , and gravity . Interest in eleven @-@ dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered . One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise , a phenomenon known as chirality . Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions . 
 In the first superstring revolution in 1984 , many physicists turned to string theory as a unified theory of particle physics and quantum gravity . Unlike supergravity theory , string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model , and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects . Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness . In ordinary particle theories , one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian . In string theory , the possibilities are much more constrained : by the 1990s , physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory . 
 = = = Relationships between string theories = = = 
 Although there were only a handful of consistent superstring theories , it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation . However , as physicists began to examine string theory more closely , they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways . 
 In the late 1970s , Claus Montonen and David Olive had conjectured a special property of certain physical theories . A sharpened version of their conjecture concerns a theory called N = 4 supersymmetric Yang – Mills theory , which describes particles similar to the quarks and gluons that make up atomic nuclei . The strength with which the particles of this theory interact is measured by a number called the coupling constant . The result of Montonen and Olive , now known as Montonen – Olive duality , states that N = 4 supersymmetric Yang – Mills theory with coupling constant g is equivalent to the same theory with coupling constant 1 / g . In other words , a system of strongly interacting particles ( large coupling constant ) has an equivalent description as a system of weakly interacting particles ( small coupling constant ) and vice versa . 
 In the 1990s , several theorists generalized Montonen – Olive duality to the S @-@ duality relationship , which connects different string theories . Ashoke Sen studied S @-@ duality in the context of heterotic strings in four dimensions . Chris Hull and Paul Townsend showed that type IIB string theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via S @-@ duality to the same theory with small coupling constant . Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T @-@ duality . This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent . 
 = = = Membranes and <unk> = = = 
 String theory extends ordinary particle physics by promoting zero @-@ dimensional point particles to one @-@ dimensional objects called strings . In the late 1980s , it was natural for theorists to attempt to formulate other extensions in which particles are replaced by two @-@ dimensional <unk> or by higher @-@ dimensional objects called branes . Such objects had been considered as early as 1962 by Paul Dirac , and they were reconsidered by a small but enthusiastic group of physicists in the 1980s . 
 Supersymmetry severely restricts the possible number of dimensions of a brane . In 1987 , Eric <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Paul Townsend showed that eleven @-@ dimensional supergravity includes two @-@ dimensional branes . Intuitively , these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven @-@ dimensional spacetime . Shortly after this discovery , Michael Duff , Paul Howe , Takeo <unk> , and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven @-@ dimensional supergravity with one of the dimensions curled up into a circle . In this setting , one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension . If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small , then this membrane looks just like a string in ten @-@ dimensional spacetime . In fact , Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory . 
 In 1990 , Andrew Strominger published a similar result which suggested that strongly interacting strings in ten dimensions might have an equivalent description in terms of weakly interacting five @-@ dimensional branes . Initially , physicists were unable to prove this relationship for two important reasons . On the one hand , the Montonen – Olive duality was still unproven , and so Strominger 's conjecture was even more tenuous . On the other hand , there were many technical issues related to the quantum properties of five @-@ dimensional branes . The first of these problems was solved in 1993 when Ashoke Sen established that certain physical theories require the existence of objects with both electric and magnetic charge which were predicted by the work of Montonen and Olive . 
 In spite of this progress , the relationship between strings and five @-@ dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to <unk> the branes . Starting in 1991 , a team of researchers including Michael Duff , Ramzi <unk> , <unk> Lu , and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up . If one considers a five @-@ dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions , then the brane looks just like a one @-@ dimensional string . In this way , the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings , and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques . 
 = = = Second superstring revolution = = = 
 Speaking at the string theory conference at the University of Southern California in 1995 , Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the surprising suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions . Witten 's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T @-@ duality and the appearance of two- and five @-@ dimensional branes in string theory . In the months following Witten 's announcement , hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way . Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution . 
 One of the important developments following Witten 's announcement was Witten 's work in 1996 with string theorist Petr Hořava . Witten and Hořava studied M @-@ theory on a special spacetime geometry with two ten @-@ dimensional boundary components . Their work shed light on the mathematical structure of M @-@ theory and suggested possible ways of connecting M @-@ theory to real world physics . 
 = = = Origin of the term = = = 
 Initially , some physicists suggested that the new theory was a fundamental theory of membranes , but Witten was skeptical of the role of membranes in the theory . In a paper from 1996 , Hořava and Witten wrote 
 As it has been proposed that the eleven @-@ dimensional theory is a <unk> theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation , we will non @-@ <unk> call it the M @-@ theory , leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes . 
 In the absence of an understanding of the true meaning and structure of M @-@ theory , Witten has suggested that the M should stand for " magic " , " mystery " , or " membrane " according to taste , and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known .

 = = = BFSS matrix model = = = 
 In mathematics , a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or other data . In physics , a matrix model is a particular kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves the notion of a matrix in an important way . A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics . 
 One important example of a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks , Willy Fischler , Stephen <unk> , and Leonard Susskind in 1997 . This theory describes the behavior of a set of nine large matrices . In their original paper , these authors showed , among other things , that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven @-@ dimensional supergravity . These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M @-@ theory . The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M @-@ theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M @-@ theory in a relatively simple setting . 
 = = = Noncommutative geometry = = = 
 In geometry , it is often useful to introduce coordinates . For example , in order to study the geometry of the Euclidean plane , one defines the coordinates x and y as the distances between any point in the plane and a pair of axes . In ordinary geometry , the coordinates of a point are numbers , so they can be multiplied , and the product of two coordinates does not depend on the order of multiplication . That is , xy = yx . This property of multiplication is known as the commutative law , and this relationship between geometry and the commutative algebra of coordinates is the starting point for much of modern geometry . 
 Noncommutative geometry is a branch of mathematics that attempts to generalize this situation . Rather than working with ordinary numbers , one considers some similar objects , such as matrices , whose multiplication does not satisfy the commutative law ( that is , objects for which xy is not necessarily equal to yx ) . One imagines that these <unk> objects are coordinates on some more general notion of " space " and proves theorems about these generalized spaces by exploiting the analogy with ordinary geometry . 
 In a paper from 1998 , Alain <unk> , Michael R. Douglas , and Albert Schwarz showed that some aspects of matrix models and M @-@ theory are described by a noncommutative quantum field theory , a special kind of physical theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the commutativity property . This established a link between matrix models and M @-@ theory on the one hand , and noncommutative geometry on the other hand . It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories . 
 = = AdS / CFT correspondence = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field , which are extended in space and time , is known as quantum field theory . In particle physics , quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles , which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields . Quantum field theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle @-@ like objects called quasiparticles . 
 One approach to formulating M @-@ theory and studying its properties is provided by the anti @-@ de Sitter / conformal field theory ( AdS / CFT ) correspondence . Proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997 , the AdS / CFT correspondence is a theoretical result which implies that M @-@ theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory . In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string and M @-@ theory , the AdS / CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional <unk> techniques are ineffective . 
 In the AdS / CFT correspondence , the geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain vacuum solution of Einstein 's equation called anti @-@ de Sitter space . In very elementary terms , anti @-@ de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points ( the metric ) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry . It is closely related to hyperbolic space , which can be viewed as a disk as illustrated on the left . This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares . One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior . 
 Now imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents the state of the universe at a given time . The resulting geometric object is three @-@ dimensional anti @-@ de Sitter space . It looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk . Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture . The surface of this cylinder plays an important role in the AdS / CFT correspondence . As with the hyperbolic plane , anti @-@ de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface . 
 This construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space dimensions and one time dimension , but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions . Indeed , hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can " stack up " copies of hyperbolic space to get higher @-@ dimensional models of anti @-@ de Sitter space . 
 An important feature of anti @-@ de Sitter space is its boundary ( which looks like a cylinder in the case of three @-@ dimensional anti @-@ de Sitter space ) . One property of this boundary is that , within a small region on the surface around any given point , it looks just like Minkowski space , the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics . One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which " spacetime " is given by the boundary of anti @-@ de Sitter space . This observation is the starting point for AdS / CFT correspondence , which states that the boundary of anti @-@ de Sitter space can be regarded as the " spacetime " for a quantum field theory . The claim is that this quantum field theory is equivalent to the gravitational theory on the bulk anti @-@ de Sitter space in the sense that there is a " dictionary " for translating entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in the other theory . For example , a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory . In addition , the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory , then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding . 
 = = = 6D ( 2 @,@ 0 ) superconformal field theory = = = 
 One particular realization of the AdS / CFT correspondence states that M @-@ theory on the product space <unk> × S4 is equivalent to the so @-@ called ( 2 @,@ 0 ) -theory on the six @-@ dimensional boundary . Here " ( 2 @,@ 0 ) " refers to the particular type of supersymmetry that appears in the theory . In this example , the spacetime of the gravitational theory is effectively seven @-@ dimensional ( hence the notation <unk> ) , and there are four additional " compact " dimensions ( encoded by the S4 factor ) . In the real world , spacetime is four @-@ dimensional , at least macroscopically , so this version of the correspondence does not provide a realistic model of gravity . Likewise , the dual theory is not a viable model of any real @-@ world system since it describes a world with six spacetime dimensions . 
 Nevertheless , the ( 2 @,@ 0 ) -theory has proven to be important for studying the general properties of quantum field theories . Indeed , this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories . For example , Luis <unk> , Davide <unk> , and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface , one obtains a four @-@ dimensional quantum field theory , and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself . More recently , theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions . 
 In addition to its applications in quantum field theory , the ( 2 @,@ 0 ) -theory has spawned important results in pure mathematics . For example , the existence of the ( 2 @,@ 0 ) -theory was used by Witten to give a " physical " explanation for a conjectural relationship in mathematics called the geometric Langlands correspondence . In subsequent work , Witten showed that the ( 2 @,@ 0 ) -theory could be used to understand a concept in mathematics called Khovanov homology . Developed by Mikhail Khovanov around 2000 , Khovanov homology provides a tool in knot theory , the branch of mathematics that studies and classifies the different shapes of knots . Another application of the ( 2 @,@ 0 ) -theory in mathematics is the work of Davide <unk> , Greg Moore , and Andrew <unk> , which used physical ideas to derive new results in <unk> geometry . 
 = = = ABJM superconformal field theory = = = 
 Another realization of the AdS / CFT correspondence states that M @-@ theory on <unk> × S7 is equivalent to a quantum field theory called the ABJM theory in three dimensions . In this version of the correspondence , seven of the dimensions of M @-@ theory are curled up , leaving four non @-@ compact dimensions . Since the spacetime of our universe is four @-@ dimensional , this version of the correspondence provides a somewhat more realistic description of gravity . 
 The ABJM theory appearing in this version of the correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons . Introduced by <unk> , Bergman , <unk> , and Maldacena , it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chern – Simons theory . The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory . In addition , the ABJM theory serves as a semi @-@ realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics . 
 = = Phenomenology = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 In addition to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest , M @-@ theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle physics . Phenomenology is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas . String phenomenology is the part of string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string and M @-@ theory . 
 Typically , such models are based on the idea of compactification . Starting with the ten- or eleven @-@ dimensional spacetime of string or M @-@ theory , physicists postulate a shape for the extra dimensions . By choosing this shape appropriately , they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics , together with additional undiscovered particles , usually supersymmetric partners to analogues of known particles . One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six @-@ dimensional Calabi – Yau manifold . This is a special kind of geometric object named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing @-@ Tung Yau . Calabi – Yau manifolds offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory . Other similar methods can be used to construct models with physics resembling to some extent that of our four @-@ dimensional world based on M @-@ theory . 
 Partly because of theoretical and mathematical difficulties and partly because of the extremely high energies ( beyond what is technologically possible for the foreseeable future ) needed to test these theories experimentally , there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature . This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems . 
 = = = Compactification on G2 manifolds = = = 
 In one approach to M @-@ theory phenomenology , theorists assume that the seven extra dimensions of M @-@ theory are shaped like a G2 manifold . This is a special kind of seven @-@ dimensional shape constructed by mathematician Dominic Joyce of the University of Oxford . These G2 manifolds are still poorly understood mathematically , and this fact has made it difficult for physicists to fully develop this approach to phenomenology . 
 For example , physicists and mathematicians often assume that space has a mathematical property called smoothness , but this property cannot be assumed in the case of a G2 manifold if one wishes to recover the physics of our four @-@ dimensional world . Another problem is that G2 manifolds are not complex manifolds , so theorists are unable to use tools from the branch of mathematics known as complex analysis . Finally , there are many open questions about the existence , uniqueness , and other mathematical properties of G2 manifolds , and mathematicians lack a systematic way of searching for these manifolds . 
 = = = <unk> M @-@ theory = = = 
 Because of the difficulties with G2 manifolds , most attempts to construct realistic theories of physics based on M @-@ theory have taken a more indirect approach to compactifying eleven @-@ dimensional spacetime . One approach , pioneered by Witten , Hořava , Burt <unk> , and others , is known as heterotic M @-@ theory . In this approach , one imagines that one of the eleven dimensions of M @-@ theory is shaped like a circle . If this circle is very small , then the spacetime becomes effectively ten @-@ dimensional . One then assumes that six of the ten dimensions form a Calabi – Yau manifold . If this Calabi – Yau manifold is also taken to be small , one is left with a theory in four @-@ dimensions . 
 <unk> M @-@ theory has been used to construct models of brane cosmology in which the observable universe is thought to exist on a brane in a higher dimensional ambient space . It has also spawned alternative theories of the early universe that do not rely on the theory of cosmic inflation . 
 = Smooth Radio ( 2010 ) = 
 From 2010 to 2014 , Smooth Radio was an independent , commercial , national radio station in the United Kingdom . Owned by Real and Smooth — a company formerly known as GMG Radio — the station was aimed at the over @-@ 40 demographic , and competed for its audience with BBC Radio 2 . It was broadcast on the DAB Digital Radio Digital 1 national multiplex , Sky , Freesat , Freeview , Virgin Media , online and on regional FM and DAB frequencies in the North West , London , North East , West Midlands , Scotland and East Midlands . Nationally the station attracted a weekly average audience of 3 million . 
 The station opened in 1990 as 102 @.@ 2 Jazz FM in London , and a second Jazz FM branded station was launched four years later in Manchester . The Manchester station became Smooth FM 100 @.@ 4 in 2004 , and was the first in the network of independent local radio stations to use the Smooth brand . The London station followed suit a year later . The network 's parent company , GMG Radio – a subsidiary of the Guardian Media Group – acquired the Saga Radio Group in the mid @-@ 2000s , and all Saga stations were given the Smooth name . After the publication of John Myers ' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio , and the passing of the 2010 Digital Economy Act allowing stations to co @-@ locate or discontinue local shows and broadcasts , Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into a single , quasi @-@ national station in October 2010 ; local news feeds were produced at GMG Radio 's headquarters in Salford Quays . 105 @.@ 2 Smooth Radio in Scotland produced its own breakfast and drivetime shows , but carried networked programming at other times . As part of their licence agreement , the London and Manchester stations were required to continue their commitment to jazz music after dropping the Jazz FM name , and the UK 's broadcasting industry regulator Office of Communications ( Ofcom ) stipulated they must broadcast 45 hours of jazz programming per week , but this requirement was ended shortly before the merger took place . 
 Smooth recruited many well @-@ known British radio personalities to its line @-@ up . Presenters on the network included Emma B , Simon Bates , Tony Blackburn , Mark Goodier , David Jensen and Chris Tarrant . The station 's flagship breakfast show was presented by Simon Bates , who left Classic FM after more than a decade . It broadcast occasional documentaries on subjects relating to music , news and media events ; some of these won the station radio industry awards . In November 2011 Smooth launched a second station on the Digital One platform dedicated to Christmas music , and later replaced this with " Smooth 70s " , which played music from the 1970s . The Christmas station returned in 2012 , and Smooth 70s closed in September 2013 . Along with its sister station , Real Radio , Smooth was an official host of the Blackpool Illuminations switch @-@ on ceremony from 2010 , and staged regular , free live music events . The station signed a number of sponsorship deals with companies such as Tetley Tea and ATS <unk> , and held annual fundraising events in aid of the charities Help for Heroes and Macmillan Cancer Support . 
 GMG Radio was taken over by rival Global Radio in June 2012 . Global 's purchase of the company was referred to Ofcom , the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global 's market share may be disproportionately large as a result of the deal , and consequently not in the public interest . GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real and Smooth Radio Ltd . A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real and Smooth . Real and Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated . Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global 's London headquarters in October 2013 . In February 2014 , Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station . Global also sold eight of its regional stations , including three operated under the Smooth brand , and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency . The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014 .

 = = = Early years as Jazz FM = = = 
 London station 102 @.@ 2 Jazz FM was launched on 4 March 1990 with a concert performed by Ella Fitzgerald at the Royal Albert Hall . Jazz FM played mainly soul and jazz music and was broadcast to the London area . A sister station in Manchester called 100 @.@ 4 Jazz FM was launched on 1 September 1994 . The Jazz FM stations were purchased by the Guardian Media Group in 2002 , and became part of the company 's radio division , GMG Radio Holdings Ltd . 
 In 2003 , GMG radio conducted market research into the type of music that listeners in the north @-@ west of England wanted to hear on the radio . The study concluded that many people were dissuaded by the name Jazz , and as a result , 100 @.@ 4 Jazz FM closed on 13 February 2004 and relaunched as Smooth FM on 1 March . In 2005 , GMG rebranded the London station 102 @.@ 2 Smooth FM . The two renamed stations played middle of the road music , soul and R & B during the day and as part of their licence requirements , jazz music at night . 
 On 20 October 2006 , GMG Radio announced that it was requesting a change of format for 102 @.@ 2 and 100 @.@ 4 Smooth FM from Ofcom , to remove the stations ' daytime soul and R & B licence commitments . GMG Radio proposed an easy listening music service mixed with speech for the over 50s , and an improved local news service . Ofcom approved the changes on 8 December 2006 , with the condition that GMG retained the 45 hours of jazz per week that constituted part of the former licence requirement . As a result of the format change and to distance the station from its London rivals Magic and Heart 106 @.@ 2 , GMG Radio agreed that a minimum of 20 % of its daytime music output would be over 40 years old . 
 = = = Change of identity and expansion = = = 
 In December 2006 , GMG Radio acquired the Saga Radio Group , which owned stations in the West Midlands , East Midlands and Scotland , and a licence to begin broadcasting to the North East , and expanded the Smooth Network . Along with the Smooth FM stations in London and Manchester , all Saga stations were relaunched under the Smooth Radio brand on 26 March 2007 . Saga 105 @.@ 7 FM in the West Midlands became 105 @.@ 7 Smooth Radio , Saga 106 @.@ 6 FM in the East Midlands became 106 @.@ 6 Smooth Radio and Glasgow based Saga 105 @.@ 2 FM became 105 @.@ 2 Smooth Radio . A service for the north @-@ east of England , 97 @.@ 5 Smooth Radio , was launched in January 2008 . To begin with , most programming for these stations was produced locally and some shows were networked from London . However , Smooth gradually increased its networked programming until most content was originated in London or Manchester . 
 In March 2008 , GMG Radio requested that Ofcom remove the 45 @-@ hour jazz commitment for its London and Manchester stations . The company planned to relaunch Jazz FM from the <unk> service which broadcast on DAB in Glasgow , online and on a DAB multiplex in London . In a meeting on 22 April 2008 , Ofcom declined the request . GMG relaunched Jazz FM despite having to retain the jazz commitment . 
 The decrease of local output lead to criticism from Norman Quirk , the former managing director of Saga 105 @.@ 2 FM in Glasgow , after GMG Radio dismissed six Scottish presenters in August 2008 in favour of increased networked content from its stations in London and Manchester . The station had operated a 24 @-@ hour schedule of local programming . Quirk labelled the dismissals " disgraceful " and expressed his fears that the station would not be able to serve the needs and interests of the Scottish people as well as Saga had done . 
 = = = Further expansion = = = 
 After John Myers ' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published , and the Digital Economy Act allowing stations to co @-@ locate or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national DAB was passed , Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi @-@ national station , and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio 's headquarters in Salford Quays . GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that it wanted to compete with BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on DAB to the whole of England and Wales , and Sky , Freesat , Freeview , Virgin Media and online . Regional content would be kept ; split news , travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional DAB stations in the North East , North West , West Midlands and East Midlands . Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information . 105 @.@ 2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the rules governing its broadcast licence , but networked content would be broadcast the rest of the time . The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended . The new Smooth Radio was launched on 4 October 2010 with most of the output originating from Salford Quays , and other programming coming from London . 
 On 1 November 2011 , GMG Radio launched " Smooth Christmas " on the Digital One multiplex , a dedicated station playing only Christmas music with no news or advertisements . It promoted Smooth Radio and broadcast until 27 December 2011 . Smooth Christmas was replaced on a trial basis by Smooth 70s , playing tracks from the 1970s . The station was warmly received by listeners , and in January 2012 GMG Radio confirmed a deal with US syndication firm Premiere Networks to air 1970s editions of the American Top 40 show presented by Casey Kasem , which would be broadcast at weekends . Smooth 70s ' weekday programming included Disco Lunch and Late Night Love Songs . Due to its popularity , Smooth Christmas was relaunched in November 2012 on the Digital One multiplex alongside Smooth 70s . 
 = = = New ownership = = = 
 In June 2012 it was reported that Guardian Media Group was seeking to sell GMG Radio in order to restructure itself to stem losses being made by The Guardian and The Observer newspapers . Several offers were received for the subsidiary , valuing it at £ 50 million . GMG Radio was sold to Global Radio on 25 June , at an estimated price of between £ 50 million and £ 70 million . Global renamed GMG Radio " Real and Smooth Radio Ltd . " Several rival radio groups expressed their concerns over the takeover and the effect it could have on commercial radio in the UK . The deal prompted speculation about the possible disappearance of the Smooth Radio brand as a result of a possible merger with Global 's Gold network , which was aimed at a similar audience . It was announced that in the short term GMG Radio and Global would continue to operate as separate entities while a review of the sale was carried out by Ofcom . 
 On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt instructed Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) to examine Global Radio 's purchase of GMG , which gave Global over 50 % of the UK radio market because of concerns the takeover may not be in the public interest . On 11 October , the OFT agreed to fast @-@ track the investigation . Hunt 's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality . The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors , and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission , which oversees business mergers and takeovers . On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013 . 
 On 21 February 2013 , the Competition Commission confirmed it would delay its decision until May , and issued a statement in which it said , " The range of possible remedies to be considered in this case is complex and that all possible remedies need to be explored with the parties to the merger and third parties " . The Commission published its final report into the acquisition on 21 May , requiring Global to sell radio stations in seven locations . On 14 June , it was reported that Global would appeal against the Commission 's decision . A date for the appeal was subsequently scheduled for October . Following the hearing , in November , the Competition Appeal Tribunal rejected Global 's appeal , meaning it would have to sell some stations in order to complete the takeover . Global announced in December that it would not appeal the decision , and would instead begin the process of selling the assets as directed by the Commission . 
 Global announced on 12 August 2013 that Real and Smooth would relocate their London and West Midlands offices to Global premises . Smooth Radio 's output was relocated to Global 's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October , a move that coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule , and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air . On 4 February 2014 , the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global Radio permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform , and to replace it with a service playing music from the 1970s , 80s and 90s . Under this agreement , Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies , but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day . On 6 February , Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stations — including those with the Smooth Radio brand in the North West , North East and East Midlands — to the Irish media holdings company <unk> . Under a franchising agreement between the two firms , these stations would retain the Smooth Radio name , but relaunch airing a mixture of both regional content and networked programming from London . Smooth would also take over Gold 's medium wave frequencies , except in London , Manchester and the East Midlands . Global announced later that month that Smooth would be relaunched from 3 March , and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March , when the stations would begin simulcasting with Smooth Radio London . This also coincided with the return of local programming at breakfast and drivetime . 
 = = Audience and ratings = = 
 Smooth Radio catered mainly for listeners over the age of 40 , a similar audience to that of BBC Radio 2 . Official quarterly audience figures collated by Radio Joint Authority Research Limited ( <unk> ) show that the station had an average weekly audience of just over 3 million listeners . Figures for the third quarter of 2010 , released in October 2010 showed that collectively , the six regional Smooth stations had a weekly audience of 3 million at the time Smooth became a national broadcaster . John Simons , Group Programme Director for GMG Radio said , " The scope for Smooth Radio is huge and we 're looking forward to seeing this growth continue as more and more people discover the station across the UK . We firmly believe Smooth has the potential to become the UK 's biggest national commercial station and these figures show it 's heading in the right direction ! " 
 During the final quarter of 2010 – the station 's first as a national broadcaster – listening figures rose to 3 @.@ 08 million , which remained unchanged in the first quarter of 2011 , although listenership in London increased by 29 % , largely because of the arrival of Simon Bates on the breakfast show in January 2011 . Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011 , with an average weekly total of 3 @.@ 2 million , which rose once again in the third quarter to 3 @.@ 328 million , meaning that for the first time Smooth 's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals , talkSPORT . The station had an audience of 3 @.@ 3 million in the final quarter of 2011 , making it the second most listened to national commercial radio station in the UK . 3 @,@ 317 @,@ 000 listeners were tuning in during the first quarter of 2012 , which dropped slightly in the second quarter to 3 @.@ 2 million . The third quarter of 2012 saw another small drop to 3 @.@ 19 million , but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749 @,@ 000 . Collectively 3 @.@ 7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth @-@ branded stations . That figure rose to 3 @.@ 8 million in the final quarter of the year . The first quarter of 2013 saw an average weekly audience of 3 @.@ 6 million , which fell to 3 @.@ 1 million for the second quarter . However , figures rose again through the second half of the year , with 3 @.@ 26 million in the third quarter of 2013 , and 3 @.@ 38 million in the fourth . 
 = = Marketing and sponsorship = = 
 When Smooth Radio launched as a national network , GMG launched a hoarding and television advertising campaign featuring eight " Smooth Ambassadors " – listeners chosen to represent the station 's " zest for life " . Each advertisement included a piece of information about one of the ambassadors , and something they were currently doing . The campaign ran throughout October and November 2010 . A later campaign featured Simon Bates , whose breakfast show attracted increased listening figures in London in early 2011 . 
 The station signed a number of sponsorship deals with advertisers , often for a particular show or for competitions associated with the advertiser . Its first major sponsorship deal was with Honda , which sponsored the drivetime show upon the station 's launch . In July 2011 GMG signed a 13 @-@ week deal with gaming website Foxy Bingo to sponsor Smooth Radio 's afternoon show , and a three @-@ month deal with ATS <unk> to sponsor the drivetime show began in September 2012 . Real and Smooth announced a three @-@ month deal with Sky Movies to sponsor Smooth 's weekend film show , Smooth Radio at the Movies from February 2013 . 
 As part of a three @-@ month deal with Tetley Tea announced in October 2011 , Smooth Radio 's logo appeared on Tetley products sold in British supermarkets . In August 2011 , GMG announced a deal with the magazine publisher IPC whereby Smooth Radio would sponsor the TV Times Awards . A trip to Kenya was given away in association with the Kenya Tourist Board in the lead up to the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton ; the winners would stay at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy , where the royal couple became engaged . High Street retailer Boots UK launched The Feel Good Forum , a health and beauty lifestyle programme that began airing for an eight @-@ week run on Real and Smooth from March 2013 . The show , presented by Kate Thornton was a collaboration between the broadcaster , Boots and other partners , including the <unk> website . Some online content was also produced to supplement the programme . In July 2013 , Real and Smooth secured a deal with the organisers of the 2014 Commonwealth Games to be the Official Media Partner for its Ticketing Campaign .

E = MC ² was hailed as one of the most anticipated albums of 2008 , with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success , following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi .

 = = Composition = = 
 " Touch My Body " is a mid @-@ tempo song , which draws influence from R & B and pop music genres . The song 's hook is built around a piano melody and " circular keyboard line " , and features " a stuttering mid @-@ tempo beat that 's accented by finger snaps and electronic synthesizers " as its instrumentation . Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe described it as a " standard @-@ issue mid @-@ tempo jam " , while The New York Sun 's Jayanthi Daniel wrote " It 's a smooth , mid @-@ tempo song with a swaying , melodic beat , and serves as a simple and mellow introduction to the material . " Writing for The Guardian , Alex Macpherson felt the song was very " girly " , and expressed how the " cushioned " track incorporates " all tactile bass bumps and tinkling music box motifs " into its production . Written by Mariah Carey , The @-@ Dream , Tricky Stewart and Cristyle , the song drew comparisons to several musical arrangements featured throughout " We Belong Together " . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , " Touch My Body " is set in common time with a tempo of 80 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of B minor , with Carey 's vocal range spanning from the low @-@ note of F ♯ 3 to the belting range of <unk> and the high @-@ note of B5 . The song follows in the chord progression of Bm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7 . 
 Lyrically , the song describes the protagonist revealing several bedroom fantasies in which she would like to engage , asking her lover playfully to " touch her body " . Though the song features sexually oriented lyrics , critics deemed that the melody and playful tone of the song made them less explicit . The song 's lyrics find Carey maintaining the duo keep the relationship private from the media , as she threatens to " hunt him down " if he shall record anything of their private life . According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times , " Touch My Body " is a " questionably sexy striptease : a goofy @-@ sleazy tryst vignette " , with Carey singing " If there 's a camera up in here then I best not catch this flick on YouTube . " Critic Rodman felt the song 's lyrics describe the protagonist 's sexual fantasies , but also serves as a warning to " potential <unk> : ' If you run your mouth and brag about our secret rendezvous / I will hunt you down . ' Yikes ! " In an interview with Fox News , journalist Hollie McKay asked Carey if there was any literal interpretation regarding the lyrics " Touch My Body / Put Me on the Floor / Wrestle Me Around / Play With Me Some More " , to which she replied " There is no full @-@ blown meaning ; it is just cute and it 's one of those songs that makes me happy . I wasn 't taking it that seriously . It was just fun experience . " Evan Sawdey from PopMatters wrote that in the song " Mariah coos soft @-@ core phone sex fantasies over <unk> piano notes , all while referencing YouTube in what appears to be a desperate grab for relevance . " In his review of the song 's parent album , Los Angeles Times critic Richard Hartog described the song 's production , Carey 's vocals and its overall mixing : 
 " Touch My Body " rides a relatively restrained slow @-@ dance groove , with some light , orchestral @-@ synth flourishes thrown in . The rhythm is almost completely carried by an effortless keyboard bump , the easygoing repetitiveness of which eventually wears the listener down , and sets up a delicate frame for Carey to sing around . She pulls back when the song picks up the pace , and Carey keeps it simple here , playing with tempos rather than range . Indeed , she almost quietly slides into the chorus . " If you run around and brag about this secret rendezvous , I will hunt you down " , she sings , letting the last line trail off . But you don 't necessarily believe her , as the feel is more playful that sinful . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Touch My Body " garnered generally positive reviews from music critics . While most reviewers complimented the song 's hook and production , as well as its playful lyrics , some were critical of Carey 's vocal performance , which they felt didn 't properly demonstrate her " The Voice " . Billboard 's Chuck Taylor gave the song a positive review , writing " this sensual jam is 100 % Mariah , packed with satisfying harmonic layers and hooky background ' oh 's , ' supersonic verses and a chorus as catchy as a winter sniffle , " Bill Lamb from About.com rated the song four out of five stars , stating that the single " is simple , sexy elegance from one of the most enduring of pop stars . " Additionally , Lamb complimented the songs " clever and sexy lyrics " , and wrote " The gentle finger @-@ snapping beat will send countless fans dancing in private reveries . " Newsday critic , Glenn Gamboa , named it as the " Song of the Week " , commenting that it was " the best opening single she 's had since ' Heartbreaker ' . " Nick Levine of Digital Spy was also impressed with the song , writing , " its cooing , sensual charms soon take hold , suggesting the wind 's still very much behind the Carey comeback bandwagon . " It was described as a " cheeky hit " by Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly , and " playful " by Los Angeles Times 's Chuck Philips . 
 Aside from common criticism aimed at Carey 's lack of vocal bombast , many made heavy comparisons to its predecessor , " We Belong Together " . Freedom Du Lac from The Washington Post compared the two heavily , while PopMatters 's Evan Sawdey felt it was " stealing the structure that made ' We Belong Together ' such a great song . " In his critique , he continued " For being an album from one of the world 's biggest pop stars , its amazing how hook @-@ free and dated if feels a mere two weeks after its release . " Slant Magazine 's critic and writer , Sal Cinquemani , wrote that the single " isn 't exactly filled with combustible energy and it lacks the full @-@ throttle belting that accompanied the Return of the Voice three years ago , but it features all of the characteristics one expects from a latter @-@ day Mariah track . " Rachel Devitt of Rhapsody expressed a desire to see Carey " show off those legendary five octaves a bit more " , while also noting the song 's " slightly paranoid / just @-@ this @-@ side @-@ of @-@ crazy lyrics threatening to hunt down her lover if he videos their tryst . " New York Daily News critic , David Hinckley , was critical on the song 's simplicity , and wrote " [ It 's ] a single that could have been cut by any one @-@ hit diva @-@ <unk> today – has scored a chart grand slam . There 's just one small price to pay for all this : the singer 's soul . "

And I 'll do stuff that I 'm totally joking and they 're like ( uses mean girl voice ) , " Why is she doing that ? Why is she doing the treadmill with her high heels on ?

" Later , he mimics Carey 's bridge : " If some <unk> up in here that want me to touch her body / Touch it / Let me hear you say , ' I @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i do . ' " According to Kelly , the remix is unofficial , and his lyrics are freestyle rap . 
 During a concert in Washington , D.C. , soul singer Aretha Franklin performed a live rendition of the song . Following a piano introduction for her song , " The House That Jack Built " , Franklin segued into " Touch My Body " , and jokingly referred to the lyrics , telling the audience " As far as I 'm concerned , what starts on the floor stays on the floor . " A writer from Rap @-@ Up commented on the performance , calling it " absolutely priceless " . Similarly , a writer from the Chicago Tribune complemented Franklin 's live rendition of " Touch My Body " , calling it " simple , enjoyable and sweet " . 
 Producer Cyril Hahn released a remix / cover version of " Touch My Body " in 2012 that garnered positive critical attention .

 = 76th Infantry Division ( United Kingdom ) = 
 The 76th Infantry Division of the British Army was raised during the Second World War to defend the Norfolk coast against a possible German invasion , before being transformed into a training division in late 1942 . New recruits to the Army were assigned to the division to complete their training . Once fully trained , the recruits were allocated to formations fighting overseas . The formation was used as a source of reinforcements for the 21st Army Group , that was fighting in Normandy . After all available British army troops left the United Kingdom for France , the division was disbanded in September 1944 . 
 In addition to the actual formation , a phantom 76th Infantry Division was formed for deception . The phantom division was part of the notional British Fourth Army , to be used for the fictitious Operation Trolleycar . This operation aimed to deceive the Germans into believing that an Allied landing would occur along the northern German coast . While the deception effort was not a complete success , it managed to divert German attention to the northern flank for the remainder of the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the early stages of the Second World War following the Battle of France in 1940 , the United Kingdom was under threat of invasion from Nazi Germany but during the summer , the Battle of Britain dampened this threat . As the year progressed , the size of the British Army increased dramatically as 140 new infantry battalions were raised . In late 1940 , with the possibility of a German invasion during 1941 , these new battalions were formed into independent infantry brigades that were then loaned to newly created County Divisions . 
 The County Divisions , including the Norfolk County Division , were around 10 @,@ 000 men strong and assigned to defend the coast of threatened sections of the country , undertaking defensive tasks including the manning of coastal artillery . These divisions were largely static , lacking mobility and also divisional assets such as artillery , engineers and reconnaissance forces . Using the new formations in this manner allowed the pre @-@ war regular infantry divisions to undertake training and form an all @-@ important reserve that could be used to counter @-@ attack any possible German landing . 
 On 22 June , Germany launched Operation Barbarossa the invasion of the Soviet Union ; this attack all but removed the German threat to the United Kingdom . The British still had to consider the threat of an invasion , due the possibility that the Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught , after which Germany could easily transfer troops back to the west . With the arrival of winter in late 1941 , the threat of invasion subsided . This , coupled with the production of new equipment for the British army , allowed the War Office to begin steps to better balance the army , due to the large number of infantry units formed during the preceding year and a half ; as part of this reform , the County Divisions were disbanded . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Home defence = = = 
 During the war , the divisions of the British Army were divided between " Higher Establishment " and " Lower Establishment " formations . The former were intended for deployment overseas and combat , whereas the latter were strictly for home defence in a static role . On 18 November 1941 , the Norfolk County Division was abolished and reformed as the 76th Infantry Division , a " Lower Establishment " division . The division , like its predecessor , comprised the 213th , the 220th and the 222nd Infantry Brigades . That day , the division was assigned artillery , an anti @-@ tank regiment , engineers and signallers ; reconnaissance troops joined the division in January 1942 . The paper strength of an infantry division at this time was 17 @,@ 298 men . Major @-@ General William <unk> Ozanne , who had commanded the Norfolk County Division since its inception , retained command of the division . The 76th Division was assigned to II Corps and maintained its previous mission of defending the Norfolk coastline . The Imperial War Museum comments that the division insignia , a " red Norfolk wherry , under sail " , underscored " the association of the Division with Norfolk " . After the division became a training formation , the insignia was only worn by the permanent division members . 
 The division was involved in establishing the ability of the Abwehr ( German military intelligence ) . A German @-@ published order of battle of the British army based within the United Kingdom , dated 10 April 1942 , was captured . This document included the division and had a near perfect listing of its subordinate units , with one exception . Rather than including the 1st Battalion , Leicestershire Regiment , the Germans believed the 18th Battalion , Welch Regiment had already replaced it . This and similar errors led the British to understand the capability of the Germans to intercept wireless communications in the United Kingdom . In 1943 , this , in part , led to the Operation Fortitude a plan to exploit the German ability and deceive their intelligence community about future Allied operations like Operation Overlord . 
 = = = Training formation = = = 
 During the winter of 1942 – 43 , the army overhauled the training of recruits . The 76th Division , along with the 48th Infantry and 77th Infantry divisions , was changed from a " Lower Establishment " unit to a " Reserve Division " . On 20 December , the division was renamed the 76th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division , becoming a training formation in the process . These three divisions were supplemented by a fourth training formation , the 80th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division , which was raised on 1 January 1943 . The 76th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division was assigned to Eastern Command , and moved to Norwich . Soldiers who had completed their corps training , were sent to these training divisions . The soldiers were given five weeks of additional training at the section , platoon and company level , before undertaking a final three @-@ day exercise . Troops would then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations . Training was handled in this manner to relieve the " Higher Establishment " divisions from being milked for replacements for other units and to allow them to intensively train without the interruption of having to handle new recruits . For example , the 9th Battalion , Dorsetshire Regiment provided recruits to other battalions within the regiment as well as the Royal Norfolk Regiment . During this period , command of the division changed several times . On 21 December 1943 , Ozanne was replaced by Major @-@ General Colin Callander who in turn was replaced by Major @-@ General John Edward Utterson @-@ Kelso on 13 March 1944 . 
 On 30 June 1944 , the 76th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division , along with the other training divisions , had a combined total of 22 @,@ 355 men . Of this number , only 1 @,@ 100 were immediately available as replacements for the 21st Army Group . The remaining 21 @,@ 255 men were considered ineligible for service abroad , due to a variety of reasons , ranging from medical , not being considered fully fit or not yet fully trained . Over the following six months , up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce the 21st Army Group , following the completion of their training and having met the required fitness levels . Stephen Hart comments that , by September , the 21st Army Group " had bled Home Forces dry of draftable riflemen " , due to the losses suffered during the Normandy Campaign , leaving the army in Britain , with the exception of the 52nd ( Lowland ) Infantry Division , with just " young lads , old men , and the unfit " . On 1 September 1944 , the division was disbanded . Utterson @-@ Kelso assumed command of the 47th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division , which took over the role of the 76th Division . 
 = = = Deception = = = 
 The creation of the fictitious division arose from an actual reorganisation of British forces . During 1944 , the British Army was facing a manpower crisis . The army did not have enough men to replace the losses to front line infantry . While efforts were made to address this ( such as transferring men from the Royal Artillery and Royal Air Force to be retrained as infantry ) , the War Office began disbanding divisions to reduce the size of the army and to transfer the <unk> men to other units to help keep those as close to full strength as possible . The 76th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division was one of several " Lower Establishment " divisions in the United Kingdom , chosen to be disbanded . 
 R Force , the Fortitude deception staff , seized upon this opportunity to retain the division as a phantom unit . A cover story was established to explain the change in the division 's status . It was claimed that with the war nearing an end , several Territorial Army divisions would revert to their peacetime recruiting role and release their equipment and resources to other units . For the 76th , this was the 47th Division . With the transfer of equipment , the 76th was notionally raised to the " Higher Establishment " and assigned to reinforce the 21st Army Group . 
 As a deception unit , the division was assigned to the bogus Operation Trolleycar . Trolleycar was initially envisioned as a fictitious amphibious assault upon the coast of the Netherlands , by the phantom British Fourth Army , to exploit the success of the authentic Operation Market Garden . When the Battle of Arnhem failed , the notional invasion plan was temporarily scrapped . Trolleycar was revived to convince the Germans that the Fourth Army would land near Emden , in support of an imaginary assault by the First Canadian Army , that would be launched west of Arnhem and through the Netherlands . The deception effort was kept up until 1945 , being wound down in January . Despite the British ceasing their attempts to deceive the Germans about this possible landing and the Germans not believing all that had been reported to them , the Germans remained anxious about a landing along the northern coast for the remainder of the war .

 = SS Iowan = 
 SS Iowan was a cargo ship built in 1914 for the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company . During World War I she was taken over by the United States Navy and commissioned as USS Iowan ( ID @-@ 3002 ) . During World War II , the ship was transferred to the Soviet Union and renamed SS Tashkent ( or <unk> in Cyrillic ) . 
 Iowan was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships for the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company . In October 1914 , five months after she was delivered to American @-@ Hawaiian , Iowan rammed and sank the United Fruit Company steamer Metapan near the entrance to New York Harbor . After repairs , Iowan resumed inter @-@ coastal service via the Panama Canal . When the canal was temporarily closed by landslides in late 1915 , Iowan sailed via the Straits of Magellan until the canal reopened in mid 1916 . During World War I , USS Iowan carried cargo , animals , and a limited number of passengers to France , and returned nearly 10 @,@ 000 American troops after the Armistice . 
 After her Navy service ended in 1919 , she was returned to her original owners , who , at least once , chartered her to another shipping company . In May 1922 , Iowan rammed and sank the Furness @-@ Prince Line steamer Welsh Prince in the Columbia River near Astoria , Oregon , killing seven men in the process . In June 1941 , Iowan ran aground on a reef near Point Conception , California , and suffered $ 500 @,@ 000 in damages while buffeted by waves on the reef . She was freed from the reef after two weeks , towed to Los Angeles , and repaired . 
 In 1942 , the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration , which transferred her to the Soviet Union under the terms of Lend @-@ Lease in December 1942 . She was assigned to the Far East Shipping Company under her new name of SS Tashkent , but sailed with the Soviet Pacific Fleet throughout the war . She delivered cargo and troops in support of the Soviet invasion of Japanese @-@ held territories in August 1945 . After the war , the ship remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet until 1966 . She was transferred to North Korea at that time to become a fish processing facility , and was scrapped in 1969 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 In May 1912 , the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point , Maryland , for two new cargo ships — Iowan and Ohioan . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8 % profit for Maryland Steel , but with a maximum cost of $ 640 @,@ 000 per ship . The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5 % down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance . Provisions of the deal allowed that some of the nine installments could be converted into longer @-@ term notes or mortgages . The final cost of Iowan , including financing costs , was $ 71 @.@ 95 per deadweight ton , which came out to just over $ 732 @,@ 000 . 
 Iowan ( Maryland Steel yard no . 132 ) was the first ship built under the contract . She was launched on 24 January 1914 , and delivered to American @-@ Hawaiian on 16 May . The ship was 6 @,@ 529 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 407 feet 7 inches ( 124 @.@ 23 m ) in length ( between perpendiculars ) and 53 feet 6 inches ( 16 @.@ 31 m ) abeam . She had a deadweight tonnage of 10 @,@ 175 LT DWT , and her cargo holds , which had a storage capacity of 490 @,@ 859 cubic feet ( 13 @,@ 899 @.@ 6 m3 ) , were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so that she could carry perishable products from the West Coast — like fresh produce from Southern California farms — to the East Coast . Iowan had a single steam engine powered by oil @-@ fired boilers that drove a single screw propeller at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ) . 
 = = Early career = = 
 When Iowan began sailing for American @-@ Hawaiian , the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii , and vice versa . Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii , while westbound cargoes were more general in nature . With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914 , American @-@ Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route . 
 At 15 : 20 on 15 October 1914 , the outbound Iowan rammed the United Fruit Company passenger and cargo steamer Metapan at the entrance of Ambrose Channel outside New York . Metapan had stopped in the dense fog , but Iowan was traveling at a rapid pace . When Iowan had appeared out of the fog some 200 to 300 yards ( 180 to 270 m ) from Metapan , the United Fruit ship sounded three blasts on the ship 's whistle — warning Iowan of the impending collision . Iowan 's captain did not alter the ship 's course , but did drop her anchor to try and slow the fully laden ship . Nevertheless , Iowan gashed the bow of Metapan and traveled almost halfway through the passenger ship . When Iowan pulled out three minutes later , Metapan began to sink rapidly . Metapan 's captain ordered his ship to sail at full speed for shoals some 200 yards ( 180 m ) distant , on which the ship grounded in 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) of water . A variety of craft — including the nearby British Royal Navy cruiser Lancaster — responded to Metapan 's SOS . Even though the ship was resting on the bottom and the passengers in no immediate danger , most of the 78 passengers and 90 crewmen evacuated the ship in lifeboats and were picked up by rescue craft . Iowan , which suffered no casualties among her crew , attempted to return to her pier in Brooklyn , but was unable and instead anchored in Ambrose Channel . Iowan 's damage was restricted to her bow , which was crushed above the waterline . Two days later , The Wall Street Journal reported that Iowan was anchored off Clifton , Staten Island , and awaiting inspection from surveyors . 
 After repairs and return to service , Iowan resumed her inter @-@ coastal service . In May 1915 , she was delayed by a large Pacific storm that was responsible for the sinking of the steamer Victoria , and also damaged Northern Pacific and Harvard . In mid @-@ September the same year , Iowan sailed from Boston for the West Coast . She arrived at Cristóbal , the Atlantic terminus of the Panama Canal , to find the canal closed by a major landslide — more than 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 760 @,@ 000 m3 ) of mud and dirt had collapsed into the Gaillard Cut . Initially , American @-@ Hawaiian had Iowan wait in case the canal would soon reopen , but when it became apparent that the closure would last some time , perhaps as long as ten months , Iowan was sent around South America to her destinations , Los Angeles and San Francisco . The Los Angeles Times reported that one portion of Iowan 's delayed cargo consisted of Christmas toys for Los Angeles merchants . The newspaper went on to predict that the delay would be " very disastrous " for the holiday season . 
 The balance of Iowan 's activities over the next two years are unclear . She may have been in the half of the American @-@ Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service . She may also have been in the group of American @-@ Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America , delivering coal , gasoline , and steel in exchange for coffee , nitrates , cocoa , rubber , and manganese ore . 
 = = World War I = = 
 On 23 December 1917 , some seven months after the United States declared war on Germany , the United States Navy acquired Iowan from American @-@ Hawaiian . USS Iowan was commissioned the same day with Lieutenant Commander Frank L. Dow , USNRF , in command . 
 Iowan loaded a cargo of 800 horses , along with flour , iron , and machinery at Newport News , Virginia and sailed for New York on 9 February 1918 . There she joined a convoy that sailed for France on 11 February and arrived at its destination on 28 February ; Iowan discharged her equine passengers — less seven that died or were destroyed during the voyage — at Remount Depot No. 3 on 5 March . Iowan continued carrying livestock and food products to France through the rest of the war . On 9 November , Iowan took on 72 officers and men , and headed for France with cargo ship Charlton Hall two days before the Armistice . 
 With the fighting at an end , the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately . Iowan was selected for conversion to a troop transport and transferred to the Cruiser and Transport Force , but before she could begin returning troops , Iowan had to undergo conversion from a cargo and animal ship . Though sources do not indicate the specific modifications Iowan underwent , typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths for troops , and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard . Similar modifications on Iowan 's sister ship Minnesotan took three months , but it is not known how long Iowan 's refit took . By the time Iowan had completed her sixth and final trooping voyage on 29 August 1919 , Iowan had carried home 9 @,@ 876 healthy and wounded men . USS Iowan was decommissioned on 22 September 1919 , and returned to American @-@ Hawaiian . 
 = = Interwar years = = 
 Iowan resumed cargo service with American @-@ Hawaiian after her return from World War I service . Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time , Iowan continued inter @-@ coastal service through the Panama Canal . For a time in the early 1920s , Iowan was chartered to the United American Line . In May 1922 , the Associated Press reported that Iowan , sailing under the United American banner , was loading wheat , flour , and lumber at Tacoma , Washington , for England and European ports . Later that same month , on 29 May , Iowan rammed and sank the Furness @-@ Prince Line cargo ship Welsh Prince in the Columbia River near Astoria , Oregon . Seven men aboard Welsh Prince were killed and three were injured in the crash and subsequent fire . 
 On 11 June 1941 , Iowan departed Los Angeles with a cargo of 4 @,@ 500 long tons ( 4 @,@ 600 t ) of steel and iron pipe destined for San Francisco ; Portland , Oregon ; and Seattle , on her last voyage before she was to be handed over to the United States Maritime Commission . At 04 : 20 on 12 June , Iowan ran aground on a reef a few hundred yards ( meters ) off shore from Government Point , — 117 nautical miles ( 217 km ) northwest of Los Angeles , — near Point Conception . Salvage operations took some two weeks , but the ship was towed back to Los Angeles and placed in drydock at the Bethlehem Shipyard on Terminal Island . Approximately 100 feet ( 30 m ) of the ship 's hull had been damaged while the ship was buffeted by waves on the reef , which had opened numerous holes in her hull . The ship 's drive shaft had broken , and her boilers and engines had shifted . The Los Angeles Times reported that estimates for Iowan 's repair ranged up to $ 500 @,@ 000 . In an inquiry held by the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation , Iowan 's captain , S. A. Gates , a Californian with 25 years of sailing experience along the coast , blamed unusual tides for the grounding . 
 = = World War II and later career = = 
 In 1942 , after Iowan was repaired and after the United States had entered World War II , the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration ( WSA ) . On 6 December 1942 , Iowan was transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend @-@ Lease , and renamed Tashkent ( <unk> Russian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) after the capital of Uzbekistan . Near the end of World War II , the WSA offered a payment of $ 694 @,@ 743 to American @-@ Hawaiian for the former Iowan as part of a $ 7 @.@ 2 million settlement for eleven American @-@ Hawaiian ships that had been requisitioned by the WSA . 
 Tashkent was assigned to the Far East Shipping Company ( FESCO ) , but sailed with the Pacific Fleet of the Soviet Navy throughout the war . Tashkent was photographed at San Francisco at some point during the war , but most of her other movements are not known . However , in August 1945 , Tashkent delivered troops and cargo in support of the Soviet invasions of Japanese @-@ held Manchuria , Korea , Sakhalin , and the Kurile Islands . After the war 's end , Tashkent returned to merchant operation with FESCO through 1966 , when she was transferred to North Korea for use as a fish processing facility . The former Tashkent was scrapped in 1969 .

 Wales Millennium Centre ( Welsh : <unk> <unk> Cymru ) is an arts centre located in the Cardiff Bay area of Cardiff , Wales . The site covers a total area of 4 @.@ 7 acres ( 1 @.@ 9 ha ) . Phase 1 of the building was opened during the weekend of the 26 – 28 November 2004 and phase 2 opened on 22 January 2009 with an inaugural concert . The centre has hosted performances of Opera , Ballet , Dance , Theater , comedy and Musicals . 
 The Centre comprises one large theatre and two smaller halls with shops , bars and restaurants . It houses the national orchestra and opera , dance , theatre and literature companies , a total of eight arts organisations in residence . It is also home to the Cardiff Bay Visitor Centre . 
 The main theatre , the Donald Gordon Theatre , has 1 @,@ 897 seats , the BBC Hoddinott Hall 350 and the Weston Studio Theatre 250 .

 = = = The failed Cardiff Bay Opera House project = = = 
 The Centre replaced an earlier project for the site , the Cardiff Bay Opera House , a plan supported by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation to construct a permanent home for the Welsh National Opera . The project failed to win financial support from the Millennium Commission , the body which distributed funds from the UK National Lottery . 
 An international design competition attracted 268 international applicants , and was won by Iraq @-@ born architect Zaha Hadid . Her avant @-@ garde design was so radical that she and a selection of other applicants were asked to submit revised designs for a second round of competition — which she again won with " a sleek and dazzling complex of sharp lines and surfaces that she compared to an ' inverted necklace ' " . 
 In December 1995 , the Millennium Commission decided against lottery @-@ money funding for the project . It was suggested that the bid failed because of " the unpopular Conservative government 's fear of controversy , " favouring the funding of projects perceived as more populist , such as the Millennium Stadium . 
 = = = Origins of Wales Millennium Centre = = = 
 After the Cardiff Bay Opera House project was rejected , a new project was conceived that included more than opera and was felt to be a better reflection of Welsh culture . The change of name symbolised this , but the project still had to overcome many hurdles . Funding from the Welsh Assembly and Millennium Commission took years to obtain . Cardiff Council had to buy the land after the previous owners , Grosvenor Waterside ( Associated British Ports property division ) threatened to build a retail centre there due to the delays . Further boosts were given by large donations from South African businessman Donald Gordon and a loan from the international bank , HSBC . The GB £ 20 million donation from Donald Gordon was split evenly between the Royal Opera House and Wales Millennium Centre and was spread over five years . This is believed to be the largest single private donation ever made to the arts in the UK .

 In addition to the two main theatres of the Donald Gordon Theatre and Weston Studio Theatre , the 37 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ metre ( 400 @,@ 000 sq ft ) phase 1 of the Wales Millennium Centre also has six function rooms : the Victor Salvi Room , the David Morgan Room , the Sony Room , the Seligman Room , the Japan Room , and the Lloyds Enterprise Suite . The Urdd Gobaith Cymru has a hostel with accommodations for 153 people overnight in en @-@ suite bedrooms , called the Urdd City Sleepover . It also has performance and teaching space in the Urdd Hall / Theatre , with 153 retractable seats . 
 The building also includes rehearsal rooms , orchestral facilities for the Welsh National Opera , dance studios for Diversions , called The Dance House , and the Blue Room , with seating for up to 100 .

 = = = Design and construction = = = 
 The Centre was designed by Jonathan Adams , of local practice Percy Thomas Architects ( taken over by Capita Group in 2004 ) , with Arup Acoustics providing the acoustic design and Arup as building engineer . His first concept drawings were made in early 1998 , by 1999 his design was starting to look more like the building it is today . 
 Construction began on 25 February 2002 , the main contractor being Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd and Kelsey Roofing Industries Ltd being the roofing contractor . Carr and Angier were the theatre consultants . Other contractors included Stent ( foundations ) , Swansea Institute of Higher Education , now part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David ( glass ) , GH James <unk> ( stonemasonry ) , <unk> ( stainless steel ) , Alfred McAlpine ( slate ) , Coed Cymru ( wood ) , Ann Catrin Evans ( door furniture ) , Amber <unk> ( etchings on glass walls ) . 
 The architect 's concept of the building was a building that expressed " Welshness " and was instantly recognisable . The building was designed to reflect the many different parts of Wales with local Welsh materials that dominate its history : slate , metal , wood and glass . All the materials used come from Wales ; the Centre was built from 1 @,@ 350 tonnes of Welsh slate , 300 @,@ 000 concrete blocks , and a million metres of electric cable . 
 Slate 
 The exterior of the building is clad in multi @-@ coloured slate collected from Welsh slate quarries . Narrow windows are built into the layers of slate to give the impression of rock ; strata they depict the different stone layers in sea cliffs . The purple slate came from the Penrhyn Quarry , the blue from Cwt y Bugail Quarry , the green from the Nantlle Valley , the grey from Llechwedd quarry , and the black from the Corris Quarry . 
 I always loved going to Ogmore and Southerndown . I thought the cliffs there looked like a building anyway . A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years . The older they get , the better they look . I wondered if it would be possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs . To do that I needed a lot of stone . Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks ; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune . But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no @-@ one wants . This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn ’ t good enough to make roof slates . Over 90 % was thrown away . But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind ... — architect Jonathan Adams 
 Metal 
 The Centre 's main feature , the bronze coloured dome which covers the Donald Gordon Theatre , is clad in steel that was treated with copper oxide . It was designed to withstand the weather conditions on the Cardiff Bay waterfront and will look increasingly better with age . The architect , Jonathan Adams , decided not to use copper and aluminium as they would both change colour with age and weather conditions . 
 We all know that steel making has been important to south Wales , just as slate making has changed the landscape of the north . We have to use a special type of steel that won ’ t go rusty near to the salt @-@ laden , maritime air of Cardiff Bay . This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool . For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a " natural " texture , and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them , even from a distance . For this reason I felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old industrial structures , such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south . — architect Jonathan Adams 
 Wood 
 Both inside and outside the building , including the main Donald Gordon Theatre , the balconies and the rear of the building , is dominated by bands of hardwood lining the walls . 
 Like the exterior of the building , the principal internal spaces are designed to make the best use of natural materials in their natural state . The structure and detail of the concourse galleries echo the form of the exterior , with the curving strata formed in native hardwoods . Oak , ash , beech , sycamore , alder , birch , chestnut and cherry woods from renewable sources in mid @-@ Wales will be used together in proportions that reflect their relative availability from the forest . The design of the concourse galleries is intended to evoke the image of the edge of the forest , partly as a counterpoint to the coastal nature of the exterior , and partly because the edge of the forest in folklore and mythology represents a line between the real world and the magical world , a line which resembles the front edge of the theatre stage . The form of trees is created by the interweaving curvature of the gallery edges , and by the random positioning of the supporting columns . — architect Jonathan Adams 
 Glass 
 Glass was used to incorporate into the bands of slate . The glass is 15 @-@ centimetre ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick and was cut and installed by the Architectural Glass Department at Swansea Institute of Higher Education . Glass is not used in the contemporary British architectural style of the glass curtain . 
 Jonathan Adams said , " The glass veins in the external walls of the Wales Millennium Centre make use of conventional glass in a unique way : the sheets of glass are stacked together and fused in a kiln to form solid blocks . "

 Inscribed on the front of the dome , above the main entrance , are two poetic lines , written by Welsh poet Gwyneth Lewis in the Welsh and English languages . The lettering is formed by windows in the upstairs bar areas and is internally illuminated at night . 
 The idea of this monumental inscription comes from Roman classical architecture . The Romans brought Christianity to these islands , along with the custom of engraving stone . The form of the Celtic cross embodies the cross @-@ fertilisation of indigenous and Roman cultures , from which the Welsh nation first emerged . The monumental inscription is a familiar feature of Roman architecture . The inscription over the entrance of the Wales Millennium Centre is a revival of this classical tradition , and also a recognition of the formative influence of Roman culture upon our nation . We ’ re lucky to have two languages ; one that we share with half the world and one which belongs just to us . Words in songs , stories and poems have helped to make Wales the proud country that it is . — architect Jonathan Adams 
 Gwyneth Lewis said of the inscription : 
 I wanted the words to reflect the architecture of the building . Its copper dome reminded me of the furnaces from Wales 's industrial heritage and also <unk> 's cauldron , from which the early poet Taliesin received his inspiration ( ' <unk> ' ) . <unk> suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations . [ ... ] It was important to me that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation of the Welsh , that they should have their own message . The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre reminded me of the horizons just beyond Penarth Head . The sea has , traditionally , been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff . The stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera , musicals and orchestral music , and I wanted to convey the sense of an international space created by the art of music . — Gwyneth Lewis 
 " In These Stones Horizons Sing " is also an orchestral work , which was composed by Karl Jenkins , and commissioned by the Wales Millennium Centre for the opening of the Centre . 
 = = = Opening weekend ceremony = = = 
 The building was officially opened on the weekend of the 26 , 27 and 28 November 2004 . The ceremony was organised by Bryn Terfel , the creative director of the whole opening weekend . 
 Day 1 – 26 November 2004 
 The day started with a speech from Lord Rowe @-@ Beddoe , chairman of Wales Millennium Centre , who declared to the crowd that the proceedings were under way . This was followed by a speech from Rhodri Morgan , the First Minister , who stressed that the new arts centre belonged to the whole nation , that it was for all of the people of Wales and not just for the elite . 
 The building was opened by Janet <unk> , a young mother from Barry , who was chosen because her 40th birthday coincided with that of the opening day . A human chain delivered the symbolic key , designed and cast by Ann Catrin Evans , to Janet with a fanfare from the National Youth Brass Band of Wales to a Karl Jenkins specially commissioned work In These Stones Horizons Sing and the Centre was open . 
 The evening celebrations began with Cymru for the World , which celebrated the achievements of five leading Welsh artists ; Gwyneth Jones , Shirley Bassey , Siân Phillips , Alun Hoddinott and Richard Burton , represented by his daughter Kate Burton . This included tributes from Robert Hardy , Jonathan Pryce , Derek Jacobi , Nana Mouskouri , Catrin Finch , Ruth Madoc and Ian McKellen . The concert was directed by Ken Caswell and conducted by David Charles Abell . 
 Bryn Terfel started off with a short speech and introduced the Wales Millennium Centre singers and dancers , who in hard hats and donkey jackets sang and danced the story of the construction of the building . They were later joined by all 322 participants in a chorus , including Gwyn Hughes Jones , Bryn Terfel and Dennis O 'Neill sang a duet from Pearl Fishers . Diversions performed a new ballet based on one of Alun Hoddinott ’ s works . The Welsh National Opera performed the final scene of Beethoven 's Fidelio in their new home . The evening ranged across all musical types from popular to classical . 
 Day 2 – 27 November 2004 
 The second day was an open door for the public to explore the Centre with a continuous stream of people filling through the building from early morning until the fireworks display out in the Roald Dahl Plass . 
 Day 3 – 28 November 2004 
 The final day of the opening weekend began with the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II , Prince Philip , and the Prince of Wales who met First Minister Rhodri Morgan and Lord Rowe @-@ Beddoe , and marked the event by unveiling a plaque . Philip Madoc , Siân Phillips , Gaby Roslin , Michael Ball , Charlotte Church , Catrin Finch and Only Men Aloud ! were among the artists that entertained the audience during the first act . The second act was opened by the Welsh National Opera and later the Kirov Ballet and Cirque <unk> entertained the audience . Bryn Terfel ended the celebrations . 
 = = Phase 2 ( C Bay ) – BBC Hoddinott Hall = = 
 Phase 2 of the Centre is home to the BBC National Orchestra of Wales ( BBC NOW ) and the BBC National Chorus of Wales . BBC NOW moved from Studio 1 at Broadcasting House in Llandaff , which the orchestra had outgrown since the late 1960s . Phase 2 opened on 22 January 2009 with an inaugural concert performed by the BBC NOW and conducted by Thierry Fischer . Phase 2 includes the 350 seater BBC Hoddinott Hall ( Welsh : Neuadd Hoddinott y BBC ) , also known simply as Hoddinott Hall , which is named after the late Welsh classical composer Alun Hoddinott CBE ( August 11 , 1929 – March 12 , 2008 ) , and the Grace Williams Studio , which is named after another Welsh composer , Grace Williams ( February 19 , 1906 – February 10 , 1977 ) , and is used as a centre for education and outreach work . Phase 2 also has space for practice rooms , a music library , backstage facilities , it also provides a four @-@ storey office space for Wales Millennium Centre and the Arts Council of Wales . 
 = = = Design and construction = = = 
 The original plans for the Centre were that it would have a concert hall , however the final design of phase 1 did not include one . Space had been left , though , for a concert hall to be built in the future when phase 1 of the Centre was opened in 2004 , and construction on phase 2 was then due to begin early in 2005 . However , construction of phase 2 did not actually begin until April 2007 . Phase 2 was designed to fit into the Centre ’ s curved slate frontage , with an upper part constructed from timber . 
 Phase 2 of the Centre was designed by the then newly qualified Tim Green and Keith Vince of Capita Architecture , formerly called Capita Percy Thomas and now part of Capita Symonds , with Arup Acoustics again providing the acoustic design . The main contractor was again Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd , with <unk> Colston Ltd responsible for the design and installation of all the mechanical , electrical and public health services in the building . Other subcontractors on the project included URS Corporation , Davis Langdon and Hulley & Kirkwood . 
 Tim Green said of the building that the exterior of the building was designed to be in keeping with the existing Wales Millennium Centre , while the interior had a theme all its own . " The concept behind the design of the interior of Hoddinott Hall was that of a traditional Welsh chapel . " " The timber treatment at low level is very reminiscent of Victorian chapels and the masonry above . The stonework you would normally get in a stone chapel has been replaced by concrete . " 
 During the design and construction period , the project name for phase 2 was C Bay . Construction of phase 2 began in April 2007 , and ended when the keys to the building were handed over at an official ceremony in September 2008 , and the beginning of the fitting out of the BBC Hoddinott Hall by BBC Wales . 
 = = = Opening Festival = = = 
 To commemorate the opening of the BBC Hoddinott Hall an inaugural concert took place on 22 January 2009 . It was part of the Opening Festival which took place between 22 January and 1 February 2009 . The concert was performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and was conducted by Thierry Fischer . The concert included the world premiere of St Vitus in the Kettle by Simon Holt , the orchestra ’ s composer in association , who took over from Michael Berkeley . The BBC Hoddinott Hall was officially opened by the Prince of Wales on 31 January 2009 , where he unveiled a plaque .

 It is also home to the Cardiff Bay Visitor Centre . 
 = = Corporate financing and rebranding = = 
 The total cost of phase 1 of the project was £ 106 @.@ 2 million . The National Lottery Millennium Fund provided £ 31 @.@ 7 million , a further £ 37 million came from The National Assembly for Wales and £ 10 @.@ 4 million was donated by the Arts Council of Wales . In addition a private investor , South African businessman Donald Gordon donated £ 20 million to be shared equally between the Royal Opera House and the Wales Millennium Centre . The Centre also received a £ 13 @.@ 5 million loan from HSBC . The remaining funds for the project came from a major sponsorship deal with the Principality Building Society . Today the Centre has many corporations and public bodies who provide sponsorship to the Centre . 
 The National Assembly for Wales announced on 6 November 2007 that it was to pay off the outstanding loan of £ 13 @.@ 5 million from HSBC and also increase the annual funding . From April 2008 , the National Assembly for Wales have given a grant to the Wales Millennium Centre with £ 3 @.@ 5 million per annum for 3 years . This would only repay the capital debt and not any ongoing operating loss as the Centre remains profitable . The money used to pay the debt came from unallocated funds from the Assembly 's previous budget and it was said by the Minister for Heritage , Rhodri Glyn Thomas , that the new money allocation would not come at the expense of other art projects from other parts of Wales . 
 The cost of phase 2 of the project was approximately £ 18 million , however the BBC does not own the building , they have leased it for 25 years from the Lime Property Fund , which is a subsidiary of Aviva Investors . The building was built by Concert Bay Ltd , which is a subsidiary of Sir Robert McAlpine Enterprises Ltd who co @-@ funded the scheme along with Lime Property Fund . 
 In November 2006 , Wales Millennium Centre announced that they would begin a two phase rebranding project . The project was won by a local Cardiff company , Sweet . The first phase of the project involved a new corporate logo , the second phase included the complete redesign of other marketing tools , such as brochures and advertisements .

 Doctor Who and Torchwood 
 The Centre has made numerous appearances in film and television including Doctor Who , whose modern era is produced locally by BBC Wales . It has appeared seven times to date : as itself from outside in the episode " Boom Town " , its marquee momentarily at the end of the episode " Bad Wolf " , its lobby as a hospital lobby in the far future in the episode " New Earth " , and again in " The Girl Who Waited " , . It also appeared briefly in the episodes " Utopia " and " The Stolen Earth " , and also in the final episode of series 3 , " Last of the Time Lords " . 
 The spin @-@ off series Torchwood , has its headquarters , known as " The Hub " , set underneath the Water Tower , Roald Dahl Plass , with the Wales Millennium Centre 's frontage featuring heavily through the show . 
 Jones Jones Jones 
 On 3 November 2006 , a record breaking attempt to gather the most people with the same surname , Jones , took place in the Centre under the show banner Jones Jones Jones , filmed for television by S4C . The record was broken with 1 @,@ 224 Joneses filling the Donald Gordon Theatre . The previous record was set in Sweden in 2004 when 583 people gathered who had the same surname of Norberg .

 Episode 1 of the second series of BBC TV show Gavin & Stacey was filmed in the Wales Millennium Centre . The centre was supposed to be an airport . 
 = 2008 French Grand Prix = 
 The 2008 French Grand Prix ( formally the <unk> Grand Prix de France ) was a Formula One motor race held on 22 June 2008 at the Circuit de Nevers Magny @-@ Cours , France . This race is ( to date ) the last French Grand Prix . It was the eighth race of the 2008 Formula One season . The 70 @-@ lap race was won by Felipe Massa for the Ferrari team after starting from second position . Kimi Räikkönen , who started from pole position , finished second in the other Ferrari car ; Jarno Trulli was third in a Toyota . 
 Räikkönen and Massa both made a clean start . Renault 's Fernando Alonso , who started third , was overtaken by Trulli and BMW Sauber driver Robert Kubica . The front three of Räikkönen , Massa and Trulli maintained their positions through the first round of pit stops . On lap 30 , Räikkönen led Massa by six and a half seconds , and Trulli by 30 seconds . Just before half distance , Räikkönen 's right exhaust pipe broke , which caused the engine to lose power . Massa , in second place , began lapping quicker than Räikkönen , and he caught and passed him on lap 39 . Massa maintained his lead through the second round of pit stops , and won the race ; Räikkönen finished almost 18 seconds behind . Trulli fended off McLaren 's Heikki Kovalainen , who challenged him in the latter stages , to take third . 
 Massa 's win promoted him into the lead of the Drivers ' Championship for the first time in his career , overtaking Kubica . Kubica was second , two points behind Massa , while Räikkönen was third . In the Constructors ' Championship , Ferrari increased their lead to 17 points ahead of BMW Sauber , McLaren a further 16 points behind in third .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The Grand Prix was contested by 20 drivers , in ten teams of two . The teams , also known as " constructors " , were Ferrari , McLaren @-@ Mercedes , Renault , Honda , Force India @-@ Ferrari , BMW Sauber , Toyota , Red Bull @-@ Renault , Williams @-@ Toyota and Toro Rosso @-@ Ferrari . Tyre supplier Bridgestone brought two different tyre compounds to the race ; the softer of the two marked by a single white stripe down one of the grooves . 
 Before the race , Robert Kubica of BMW led the Drivers ' Championship , with 42 points , ahead of McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari 's Felipe Massa , who each had 38 points . Massa 's teammate Kimi Räikkönen was fourth , ahead of Kubica 's teammate Nick Heidfeld in fifth . In the Constructors ' Championship , Ferrari were leading with 73 points ; three points ahead of BMW Sauber with 70 points ; McLaren were a further 17 points behind them in third . 
 Ferrari came into the race with a long series of success at the track , having won seven of the last ten races held at Magny @-@ Cours . In 2007 , Ferrari had taken a one @-@ two , Räikkönen ahead of Massa . Massa said that it was important not to discount McLaren and BMW : 
 In recent years , people would say that Canada and Monaco suited McLaren better than Ferrari , while it was the other way round in France and Britain , but I don 't think that is really the case this year , as apart from any other factors , we have to consider the BMW team in this equation . This year in Monaco , Ferrari had the whole front row of the grid , even though I think we had more fuel than McLaren and in Canada our race pace was very good too . In other races we have all been very close . 
 In March 2007 , the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile ( FFSA ) stated their intention to rest the Magny @-@ Cours circuit from the Formula One world championship for the 2008 season . Despite this , the race was held in 2008 , but the race was dropped from the Formula One calendar for 2009 . As of 2015 , the Formula One World Championship had not returned to France since . 
 At the previous race in Canada , Hamilton had crashed into Räikkönen in the pit lane , when <unk> braked to stop in front of the red light at the end of the pit lane . Williams ' driver Nico Rosberg then collided into the back of Hamilton . Hamilton later said that he saw the light too late and could not avoid hitting the Ferrari . Hamilton and Rosberg were both given ten place grid penalties for the French Grand Prix , meaning that whatever their qualifying position , they could start no better than 11th . After the penalty was given , McLaren 's CEO , Martin Whitmarsh , said that he thought the penalty was " severe " , citing a similar incident at Monaco where <unk> had crashed into the back of Force India 's Adrian Sutil . There , no penalty had been given . However , Rosberg said that the penalties from Canada were " deserved " . When Hamilton was asked whether the penalty would force him to change his approach , Hamilton said that " it doesn 't really . It 's a race , I 'm here to win and so I approach it the same . " " It 's going to be harder , " he added , " coming from the back , but I don 't have any doubts or any worries , I think we 're going to have a very strong package this weekend , and I think the car will be as good if not better than it was in the last race . With that pace , as long as we stay out of trouble we should be able to score some good points . " 
 Renault driver Nelson Piquet Jr . , who was in his first year in Formula One and had scored no points prior to this race , said that he thought that the track suited him and the car much better than previous races . BMW Sauber had taken their first victory at the previous race , but team principal Mario Theissen said that a second win was unlikely at Magny @-@ Cours . 
 In technical developments , BMW Sauber , Ferrari , McLaren and Toyota all revised their front wings . BMW brought both their new wing as well as the version they had used for the previous race to Magny @-@ Cours , but decided to use the revised wing , as it offered better levels of downforce . Ferrari 's wing changes aimed at improving the performance of the car 's nose hole . The nose hole , which had been introduced at the Spanish Grand Prix , aimed at creating greater levels of downforce , by channelling the airflow . Williams changed their front sidepod winglets . At the previous race , Red Bull modified their RB4 's bridge wing to prevent it from flexing , to comply with the latest rule clarifications . For Magny @-@ Cours , the team revised the central section of this element , with the aim of generating greater downforce levels . 
 = = = Practice and qualifying = = = 
 Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race — two on Friday , and a third on Saturday . The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes . The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour . In the first practice session , which was held in dry conditions , Ferrari 's Felipe Massa was quickest , ahead of the McLarens of Hamilton and Kovalainen in second and third . Massa 's teammate , Räikkönen , was fourth quickest . The afternoon session , which was held in very hot conditions , saw Renault 's Fernando Alonso record the fastest lap , ahead of the two Ferrari drivers . The hot weather conditions posed several problems for the drivers , as many of the cars ran off the road , sliding through the gravel or across the asphalt . At the end of the session , a new system — designed to limit the cars ' speeds in potentially hazardous situations — was tested . In the third practice session , again held in dry conditions , Renault continued their strong practice performance with Piquet leading the final practice session . Red Bull 's Mark Webber was next quickest while Sebastian Vettel of Toro Rosso was third . As was the pattern for the season , the McLaren and Ferrari drivers ran heavier fuel loads in this session in preparation for the final section of qualifying . 
 Saturday afternoon 's qualifying session was divided into three parts . In the first 20 @-@ minute period , cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated . The second qualifying period lasted for 15 minutes , at the end of which the fastest ten cars went into the final period , to determine their grid positions for the race . Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race but those competing in it were not , and so carried more fuel than they had done in the earlier qualifying sessions . 
 Räikkönen clinched Ferrari 's 200th pole position , with a time of 1 : 16 @.@ 449 . He was joined on the front row of the grid by teammate Massa . Alonso qualified third after Hamilton 's penalty moved the quicker McLaren driver to 13th ; Toyota 's Jarno Trulli qualified fourth . Kovalainen would have started from fifth , but was given a five @-@ place grid penalty for blocking Webber during qualifying and would start from 10th on the grid . Kubica , Webber , David Coulthard , Timo Glock and Piquet rounded off the top ten . Heidfeld qualified 11th , with Vettel ahead of Hamilton in 12th , and Bourdais behind in 14th . Rosberg was next quickest , but after his penalty demoted him to the back of the grid his teammate Kazuki Nakajima took his place . The final four places went to the Honda and Force India teams , with Button qualifying ahead of Barrichello , Fisichella and Sutil . Barrichello , however , was given a penalty for changing his gearbox , meaning that he started 20th on the grid , one place behind Rosberg .

 The conditions on the grid were dry before the race , although the sky was overcast ; weather forecasts predicted rain near the end of the race . Most of the frontrunners began the race on the harder compound tyre . Rain that had fallen earlier that morning had removed some of the rubber on the track , meaning that graining , when small grains of rubber come off a tyre , was likely to be a problem ; out of the two tyre types , the harder would better cope with this . Räikkönen made a good start , retaining his first position ; Massa behind him maintained his second place . Alonso , who started third , was passed by both Trulli and Kubica , but re @-@ passed Kubica at the hairpin turn exit . Glock also made a good start , taking sixth after passing Webber . Going into the first corner , Button touched Bourdais , resulting in damage to the Honda 's front wing . Hamilton , who started 13th , passed several drivers to move into 10th by the end of lap one . 
 At the end of the first lap , Räikkönen led from Massa , Trulli , Alonso , Kubica , Glock and Webber . On lap five , Hamilton overtook Kovalainen to move into ninth . On the same lap , Button was forced to make an unscheduled pit stop , due to the damage he had sustained in his first corner incident with Bourdais . This dropped him to the back of the field . By the end of lap 10 , Räikkönen led Massa by 3 @.@ 2 seconds , Trulli a further 8 @.@ 5 seconds behind . On lap 13 , Hamilton was given a drive @-@ through penalty for cutting the corner of Turn Seven on lap one , and gaining an advantage . He took the penalty immediately , and re @-@ emerged in 13th position . Over the next few laps , the Ferrari drivers continued to pull out a gap on Trulli in third , lapping at around a second per lap quicker than the Toyota . On lap 16 , Räikkönen set the fastest lap of the race , a 1 : 16 @.@ 630 , stretching his lead over his teammate . Further back , Alonso , who had been running fourth , made the first scheduled pit stop , resuming 12th . Button was lapped by several drivers , due to the damage his car had sustained in his first corner incident with Bourdais , and eventually retired on lap 17 . 
 On lap 20 , Trulli and Kubica , then in fourth , pitted . Over the next two laps , both Räikkönen and Massa pitted . By lap 30 , Räikkönen had opened his lead to 6 @.@ 6 seconds over Massa , while Trulli was over half a minute behind him in third . Just before half distance , Räikkönen 's pace became slower , and Massa behind him caught up , passing his teammate on lap 39 . After the race , Räikkönen explained that his lack of pace was due to his car 's right exhaust pipe breaking , causing the engine to lose power . Further back , Kovalainen , who was running seventh , passed Webber to take sixth . 
 By lap 46 , Massa had a 10 second lead over his teammate . On the same lap , Kubica pitted from fourth , starting the next round of pit stops . Trulli pitted from third on lap 50 , and Räikkönen and Kovalainen two laps later . Massa pitted on lap 54 , and emerged 13 @.@ 4 seconds ahead of Räikkönen . Trulli kept his third position , but Kovalainen , who made up several places through the pit stops to move to fourth , was closing behind him . On lap 55 , light rain started to fall . Although it would continue to rain lightly for the next few laps , it was never heavy enough to be a problem to the drivers . By lap 58 , Kovalainen was right behind Trulli . A few laps later , the exhaust pipe which had broken earlier on Räikkönen 's car came off completely , but Räikkönen continued to race with similar lap times . Kovalainen , meanwhile , continued to try to find a way past Trulli . One lap before the end of the race , Kovalainen attempted to pass Trulli , but ran wide as Trulli defended his position . 
 Massa crossed the line to win the race , with Räikkönen nearly eighteen seconds behind . Trulli retained third , and took his first podium since the 2005 Spanish Grand Prix , and Toyota 's first podium since the 2006 Australian Grand Prix . Kovalainen finished fourth , ahead of Kubica , Webber and Piquet , who took his first ever points in Formula One . Alonso , Coulthard , Hamilton , Glock , Vettel , Heidfeld and the lapped Barrichello , Nakajima , Rosberg , Bourdais , Fisichella and Sutil were the last of the finishing drivers .

 Massa was delighted with his race victory , saying , " A great race , a fantastic result . The win came my way because Kimi had a problem with his car and at the pace he was running , it would have been hard for me to beat him on the track . I would have been happy with second place but of course , the win makes me even happier . " After the race , Räikkönen said , 
 Obviously I am a bit disappointed because I had hoped to win . Unfortunately , the right exhaust pipe broke just before half @-@ distance and the engine lost a lot of power , especially on the straight after the slow corners . After a few laps , the situation seemed better , but towards the end of the race , I ran the risk of stopping . This sort of thing can happen in racing and I have to try and look on the bright side : eight points are still a good amount and the one @-@ two finish is a great result for the team . Luckily , I had built up quite a good lead in the first part thanks to a car that was really very competitive . 
 Trulli said , " Today was a great race , hard and tough . We had a good pace , even if we had to battle with some cars that were quicker than us . I had to fight really hard but that is what people should expect both from myself and from Toyota . " Hamilton commented on his drive @-@ through penalty : " My drive @-@ through penalty was an extremely close call : I felt I 'd got past Vettel fairly and was ahead going into the corner . But I was on the outside and couldn 't turn @-@ in in case we both crashed , then I lost the back @-@ end and drove over the kerb . " 
 After BMW Sauber 's victory at the previous race , their director , Mario Theissen , said that " over the entire weekend here our package did not work perfectly " , while driver Heidfeld said that it was a " disappointing result " . Alonso said that he felt disappointed after his poor start to the race . Red Bull 's director , Christian Horner , said that their problems lay in the bad starts their drivers had made . Button , who retired during the race , commented on his collision : " I got a good start and was alongside Bourdais . I thought he was going to turn in at turn one and close the door so I pulled in behind him and then unfortunately hit him in the rear as everything slowed down for the corner . I could feel that there was something broken at the front of the car as there was an air coming in from the front , but the car was <unk> and I was staying with the back of the pack so I continued . We replaced the nose but the bargeboards had been pulled off and the car had become undriveable so I had to retire . " Piquet scored his first points in Formula One in the race , having failed to score up to that point . He said that he was happy , and hoped that the team could " continue like this for the rest of the season " . 
 After the race , Massa moved into the lead of the Drivers ' Championship , on 48 points , taking the Championship lead for the first time in his Formula One career . <unk> lost the lead of the Drivers ' Championship , falling two points behind Massa . Räikkönen moved ahead of Hamilton , on 43 points , while Hamilton was five points further behind . Heidfeld remained fifth . Before the race , Ferrari had been just three points ahead of BMW in the Constructors ' Championship ; after the race , Ferrari moved into a comfortable 17 point advantage . McLaren made up one point on BMW , although they were still 16 points behind .

 = Maya Sita = 
 In some adaptations of the Hindu epic Ramayana , Maya Sita ( Sanskrit : <unk> सीता , " illusional Sita " ) or Chaya Sita ( <unk> सीता , " shadow Sita " ) is the illusionary duplicate of the goddess Sita ( the heroine of the texts ) , who is abducted by the demon @-@ king Ravana of Lanka instead of the real Sita . 
 In the Ramayana , Sita – the consort of Rama ( the prince of Ayodhya and an avatar of the god Vishnu ) – is seized by Ravana and imprisoned in Lanka , until she is rescued by Rama , who slays her captor . Sita undergoes Agni Pariksha ( an ordeal of fire ) by which she proves her chastity before she is accepted by Rama . In some versions of the epic , the fire @-@ god Agni creates Maya Sita , who takes Sita 's place and is abducted by Ravana and suffers his captivity , while the real Sita hides in the fire . At Agni Pariksha , Maya Sita and the real Sita exchange places again . While some texts mention that Maya Sita is destroyed in the flames of Agni Pariksha , others narrate how she is blessed and reborn as the epic heroine Draupadi or the goddess Padmavati . Some scriptures also mention her previous birth being Vedavati , a woman Ravana tries to molest . 
 The Maya Sita motif saves Sita – the chief goddess of Rama @-@ centric sects – from falling prey to Ravana 's plot of abduction and safeguards her purity . Similar doubles or surrogates of Sita and other goddesses are found in various tales of Hindu mythology . 
 = = Original plot of the Ramayana = = 
 The Ramayana ( 5th to 4th century BCE ) by Valmiki does not mention Maya Sita . Sita , the princess of Mithila , is married to Rama , the prince of Ayodhya . Rama is forced to go on a 14 @-@ year exile and is accompanied by Sita and his brother Lakshmana . Ravana , the demon @-@ king of Lanka , plots to abduct Sita , aided by <unk> , who transforms into a magical golden deer ( Maya mriga , an illusional deer ) , that entices Sita . While in exile in Dandaka forest , Rama goes after the deer and slays it . The magical deer gives a call of help in Rama 's voice . Sita forces Lakshmana to go and help Rama , leaving her alone . Ravana comes disguised as an ascetic and kidnaps her . He imprisons her in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka , until she is rescued by Rama , who slays Ravana in war . When Rama doubts Sita 's chastity , she undergoes a trial by fire ( Agni Pariksha ) . Sita enters a burning pyre declaring that if she has been faithful to Rama let the fire not harm her ; she comes out unscathed with the fire @-@ god Agni as proof of her purity . Rama accepts Sita back and returns to Ayodhya , where they are crowned as king and queen .

 The Maya Sita motif is considered as the " most important instance of an addition " in the Ramayana . The Kurma Purana ( c . 550 – 850 CE ) is the first text where Maya Sita appears . The key event of the Ramayana story – the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana – was replaced with the abduction of Maya Sita ( an unreal Sita ) by Ravana ; meanwhile Sita is protected in the refuge of Agni , the fire god . This " important ideological development " in Vaishnavism ( Vishnu @-@ centric sect ) protected Sita 's chastity . Some versions of the Ramayana such as the ones in the Mahabharata ( 5th to 4th century BCE ) , the Vishnu Purana ( 1st century BCE – 4th century CE ) , the Harivamsa ( 1 – 300 CE ) and several Puranas ( the suffix Purana denotes that the text is part of this genre ) omit the Agni Pariksha altogether to avoid questioning Sita 's purity . In contrast , this very Agni Pariksha became a device for the return of the unblemished Sita , as Sita and Maya Sita switch places again , in some later versions . 
 With the growing popularity of Rama bhakti movement in the 12th century , numerous works adopted the concept of Maya Sita . Devotees could not bear that Sita – the consort of Rama and the chief goddess of Rama @-@ centric sects – was kidnapped by the demon Ravana and had to suffer his imprisonment and was defiled by his touch . The Maya Sita concept saves Sita from suffering Ravana 's custody and succumbing to the temptation of acquiring the illusory deer . Instead , the texts create an illusory Sita , who does not recognize the illusory deer . The illusory deer motif in the Ramayana may have inspired the Maya Sita concept too . Maya Sita also excuses Sita from rebuking Lakshmana when she forces him to leave her and aid Rama in the illusory deer tale . 
 Though the Maya Sita motif was found earlier in the Kurma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana ( 801 – 1100 CE ) where Sita 's purity is safeguarded , it is the Adhyatma Ramayana ( a part of the Brahmanda Purana , c . 14th century ) , where Maya Sita plays a much greater role in the plot . The concept of maya ( illusion ) is an integral part of the narrative ; the best examples being Maya Sita and Maya mriga ( illusory deer ) . Though Adhyatma Ramayana originated in Varanasi in North India , it influenced <unk> ( South India ) and Oriya ( East India ) renditions of the Ramayana , but most importantly influenced the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas ( <unk> – 1623 ) . 
 The Ramcharitmanas expands on the Agni Pariksha narrative . Since no one knows about the replacement of the real Sita by Maya Sita , Sita 's chastity is in question . The text explicitly states that the Agni Pariksha destroys the Maya Sita as well as the " stigma of public shame " , that Sita would have had to otherwise endure . Rama is exculpated from using harsh words to " Sita " at the time of Agni Pariksha as he knows it is the false Sita he is accusing . Sita is saved from public humiliation as her chastity is proven by Agni Pariksha . The moral status of Rama as well as Sita is protected by the Maya Sita motif . 
 In many versions of the tale , the omniscient Rama knows about Sita 's impending abduction and creates Maya Sita . Such versions assert Rama 's divine status , a departure from Valmiki 's portrayal of Rama as a human hero . 
 The motif also appears in the Devi Bhagavata Purana ( 6th – 14th century CE ) and the Adbhuta Ramayana , ( c . 14th century CE ) as well as Oriya works like Balarama Dasa 's <unk> Ramayana , Upendra 's <unk> Vilasa and the Oriya Ramlila , dramatic folk re @-@ enactment of the Ramayana . 
 = = Legend = = 
 In the Kurma Purana , Sita prays to Agni just when Ravana arrives to kidnap her . Agni creates Maya Sita – an exact double of Sita – who takes the place of Sita and is abducted by the demon . While Sita is taken by Agni to heaven , Maya Sita is confined in Lanka . After Ravana 's death , when Maya Sita enters the fire at Agni Pariksha , Agni restores the real undefiled Sita to Rama ; meanwhile Maya Sita is destroyed in the blaze . The Chaitanya <unk> , a biography of the Vaishnava saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu ( 1486 – 1533 ) , by <unk> <unk> ( b . 1496 ) alludes to the Kurma Purana tale . Chaitanya meets a brahmin Rama devotee in Madurai . The brahmin is devastated after learning that " mother Sita , mother of the universe and the supreme goddess of fortune " was stained by Ravana 's touch and gives up food . The saint consoles the brahmin saying that Sita 's spiritual form can not be touched by the demon ; it was Maya Sita that was taken away by Ravana . The brahmin feels better and accepts food . Chaitanya then travels to Rameswaram , where he listens to the Kurma Purana and obtains the authoritative proof to comfort the brahmin . He returns to Madurai with the Kurma Purana manuscript , leaving that brahmin overjoyed . 
 While Agni is the saviour in the Kurma Purana , the Rama @-@ centric Adhyatma Ramayana replaces Agni with the omniscient Rama as the mastermind . Rama knows of Ravana 's intentions and orders Sita to place her <unk> ( shadow ) outside the hut for Ravana to abduct and go inside the hut and live hidden in the fire for a year ; after Ravana 's death , she would unite with him again . Sita complies and creates her illusionary form , Maya Sita , and enters the fire . After Maya Sita 's seizure , Rama grieves for Sita . It is unclear if Rama pretends to grieve or forgets that Maya Sita is the one actually kidnapped . After Ravana 's death , Maya Sita has to face the Agni Pariksha and vanishes in the fire . Agni reinstates Sita and declares that Rama created the illusionary Sita to bring about Ravana 's annihilation and with that purpose served , the true Sita returns to Rama . Inspired by Adhyatma Ramayana , the <unk> has a very similar narrative ; however , Agni <unk> narrative is longer and Maya Sita is explicitly stated to be destroyed in the fire . The Nepali <unk> Ramayana by <unk> Acharya ( 1814 – 1868 ) portrays Rama creating the illusionary Sita from the sacred Kusha grass and entrusting Sita to Agni ; at Agni Pariksha , the grass Maya Sita turns into ashes while the true Sita reappears before the world . A popular Indian television series Ramayan ( 1987 – 88 ) by Ramanand Sagar reveals that Maya Sita had replaced Sita only in the Agni Pariksha scene and uses flashback to narrate about the exchange . 
 The Brahma Vaivarta Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana narratives are similar to each other and divulge about Maya Sita 's life after Agni Pariksha . The Devi Bhagavata Purana states : Agni comes , disguised as a brahmin , to Rama and informs him that he had been sent by the gods to warn Rama about the future , when Rama will fulfil the purpose of his birth on earth and slay Ravana ; Sita would be abducted by Ravana and would lead to his downfall . Agni requests Rama to hand over Sita to him for safekeeping and substitute her with Maya Sita ; after Ravana 's destruction when Sita would be asked to prove her chastity by entering fire , Maya Sita will be replaced with the real Sita again . Rama consents . Agni mediates and creates Maya Sita , who looks perfectly like the original Sita . Maya Sita and Sita switch places and Agni disappears with the real Sita , extracting the promise from Rama that the replacement of Sita remains secret ; not even Lakshmana should know . Maya Sita longs for the illusional deer and is consequently kidnapped . As per the plan , Maya Sita vanished in the fire at Agni Pariksha and real Sita comes out . 
 When Rama abandons the young Maya Sita at Agni Pariksha , she – worried about her uncertain future – questions Rama and Agni about what should she do now . They advise her to go to Pushkar and perform austerities ( Tapas ) and prophesy that she will be become <unk> ( " Lakshmi of the heaven " ) as the result of her asceticism . Shiva is pleased with her penance and promises to grant her desired boon . Maya Sita , who is transformed into <unk> by practising austerities for three lakh years , anxiously repeats five times that she get a husband . Shiva blesses her that she will be born as Draupadi , the princess of <unk> , who will have five husbands . Draupadi , the heroine of the Mahabharata , is born out of the flames of a yajna ( fire sacrifice ) of Drupada ( King of Panchala ) and later becomes the common wife of the five Pandava brothers , princes of Kuru kingdom . The text also declares that in previous birth , Maya Sita was Vedavati , a woman Ravana tries to rape and who curses Ravana that she will be the cause of his ruin . Since she has taken birth in three <unk> ( ages ; a cycle of four ages is believed to repeat ) – Vedavati in Satya yuga , Maya Sita in Treta Yuga and Draupadi in <unk> yuga , she is known as <unk> , the one who appears in the three ages . 
 The Tamil text Sri <unk> <unk> relates Maya Sita to Vedavati , but her next birth is Padmavati , not Draupadi . After Ravana tries to molest Vedavati , she curses him that she would destroy his clan . She seeks the protection of Agni . Agni consoles her and gives her not only shelter but also the opportunity to take her vengeance . He disguises Vedavati as Sita , who is going to be kidnapped by Ravana and hides the real Sita in his refuge . At the time of Agni Pariksha , Vedavati enters the fire and Agni accompanies Sita and Vedavati out in public . Rama is perplexed seeing the two <unk> . The real Sita informs Rama that Vedavati was abducted in her place and suffered the incarceration in Lanka . She demands Rama to marry Vedavati , however Rama refuses citing his vow to have only one wife in this birth . He promises that in Kali yuga ( the present and final age ) , when he appear on earth as Venkateshwara , Vedavati will be born as Padmavati , whom he will marry . Unlike Sanskrit texts , Agni plans the whole thing and Sita conspires with him to protect herself , but also safeguards the surrogate Sita 's interests . 
 In the Malayalam Adhyatma Ramayana by <unk> <unk> ( 16th century ) , Vedavati – disguised as Sita – appears before Sita from the latter 's kitchen fire and volunteers to be kidnapped in Sita 's place . As per Vedavati 's advice , Sita hides in fire and lives in Agni 's protection . After Agni Pariksha when Sita is reunited with Rama , Vedavati is blessed to marry Vishnu in Kali yuga . 
 Sometimes , Sita replaces Maya Sita temporarily before the Agni Pariksha . The Ramayana narrates that the monkey @-@ god Hanuman , a devotee of Rama , was sent by Rama to seek Sita and eventually succeeds in discovering her whereabouts in Lanka ; where she meets with him . <unk> 's Sri Sankat Mochan Hanuman Charit Manas ( 1998 ) , a devotional text attributed to Tulsidas and devoted to Hanuman , uses the Maya Sita motif , but raises the question how Hanuman could interact with such devotion with a false Sita . Sita takes the place of Maya Sita in captivity temporarily to meet the great devotee . 
 = = Divine doubles : inspiration and influences = = 
 Though the tale of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original , the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself . In the battle between Rama and Ravana , Indrajit – the son of Ravana – creates an illusionary Sita ( Maya Sita ) and kills her in front of Rama 's monkey general Hanuman , as a war tactic to dampen the spirits of Rama 's army . The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama , who is also dejected by the news . However , they soon realise that it must be an illusion of Indrajit . Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic . At the end of the Ramayana , a golden image of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices , after Sita 's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects . 
 The Ananda Ramayana does have the Maya Sita , who is kidnapped by Ravana , but has an illusory Sita called <unk> <unk> ( " shadow of Rajas and Tamas elements " ) of Sita , who is abandoned by Rama while the sattva @-@ <unk> ( " sattva form " ) – the real Sita – remains unseen by her husband 's left side , the traditional place of a Hindu wife . Kamban 's Ramavataram ( 12th century ) narrates that Shurpanakha – the sister of Ravana – impersonates Sita to seduce Rama , but her trickery is exposed by him . In a 14th @-@ century Nepalese drama , Shurpanakha disguises as Sita , but Rama is fooled by her appearance . When real Sita also appears , Rama is perplexed . However , Lakshmana tests the two <unk> and rightly judges the real one . The Ramcharitmanas narrates that the goddess Sati , wife of the god Shiva , tries to test Rama by appearing before him disguised as Sita when he is searching for his kidnapped wife . However , Rama sees through her disguise ; Shiva abandons her , angry with her action . 
 In some adaptations of the Ramayana , other characters also use surrogates to save themselves from Ravana . A Tamil text narrates how Ravana once asks for Parvati as boon from her husband Shiva , however Vishnu – disguised as a sage – deludes Ravana into believing Shiva granted him an illusionary Parvati . Ravana entrusts Parvati to Vishnu and mediates again to compel Shiva to give him the real Parvati . This time , Shiva gives an illusionary Parvati , which he accepts as the real one and returns to Lanka with her . In the Malay Ramayana , Ravana sets his eyes on Rama 's mother , however she transforms a frog into her image and sends this surrogate to be Ravana 's wife . 
 Other divinities also employ surrogates to meet their own needs . In the Puranas , Sati commits suicide by immolating herself when Shiva is insulted and is reborn as Parvati and becomes Shiva 's consort again . In a later Sanskrit text , Sati creates a surrogate who burns herself , while the real Sati is reborn as Parvati . In the Mahabharata , the goddess Svaha assumes the form of six of the wives of the Saptarishi ( seven great sages ) , with whom Agni is in love with , and has coitus with him . Later , Svaha marries Agni . 
 Other cultures also employ surrogates to save protagonists from pain . Christian Gnostic traditions suggest that Simon of Cyrene as the man who was crucified , instead of Jesus , a concept deemed heretical . Unlike Christianity , " divine doubles " are accepted in Hindu and Greek tales . In some retellings of the Trojan War saga , a phantom Helen of Troy is kidnapped by Paris which brings upon the great war ; a story parallel to the story of abduction of Maya Sita by Ravana . 
 = Tarakeswar affair = 
 The Tarakeswar affair ( also known as the Tarakeswar scandal or the Mahant @-@ Elokeshi affair ) refers to a public scandal in 19th @-@ century Bengal during the British Raj . It resulted from an illicit love affair between Elokeshi , the wife of a government employee Nobin Chandra , and the Brahmin head priest ( or mahant ) of the Tarakeswar Shiva temple . Nobin subsequently decapitated his wife Elokeshi because of the love affair . A highly publicised trial followed , dubbed the Tarakeswar murder case of 1873 , in which both the husband and the mahant were found guilty in varying degrees . 
 Bengali society considered the mahant 's actions as punishable and criminal , while justifying Nobin 's action of killing an unchaste wife . The resulting public outrage forced authorities to release Nobin after two years . The scandal became the subject of Kalighat paintings and several popular Bengali plays , which often portrayed Nobin as a devoted husband . The mahant was generally presented as a womaniser , who took advantage of young women . The murder victim Elokeshi was sometimes blamed as a seductress and the root cause of the affair . In other plays , she was absolved of all guilt and was portrayed to have been tricked and raped by the mahant . 
 = = Summary = = 
 Elokeshi , the sixteen @-@ year @-@ old housewife of the Bengali government employee Nobin Chandra ( <unk> / <unk> / Nobin Chandra ) Banerjee , lived in the village of Tarakeswar with her parents , while Nobin was away for work in a military press in Calcutta . She approached <unk> Giri , the " powerful " mahant of the popular and prosperous Tarakeswar temple , seeking fertility medication ; however the mahant allegedly seduced and raped her . An affair began with the " connivance " of Elokeshi 's parents . 
 When Nobin returned to the village , he learned about the affair from village gossip . Nobin was publicly humiliated following the discovery of the affair . He confronted Elokeshi , who confessed and begged him for forgiveness . Not only did Nobin forgive her but he decided to run away with her from Tarakeswar . However , the mahant did not allow the couple to escape ; his goons blocked their way . Overcome with anger and jealousy , Nobin slit his wife 's throat with a fish knife , decapitating her , on 27 May 1873 . Full of remorse , Nobin surrendered to the local police station and confessed his crime . 
 The Tarakeswar murder case of 1873 ( Queen vs Nobin Chandra Banerjee ) first stood in the <unk> Sessions Court at Serampore in south @-@ west Bengal . The Indian jury acquitted Nobin , accepting his plea of insanity , but the British judge Field overruled the jury 's decision and forwarded the matter to the Calcutta High Court . However , Judge Field accepted that there was an adulterous relationship between Elokeshi and the mahant , with whom she was seen " joking and flirting " . Judge <unk> , who presided over the case in the High Court , also accepted the evidence proving adultery . The High Court convicted both Nobin and the mahant . Nobin was sentenced to life imprisonment ; the mahant got 3 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of 2000 rupees . 
 = = Public reaction = = 
 The newspaper <unk> remarked : " People flock to the Sessions Court as they would flock to the Lewis Theatre to watch Othello being performed " . The courtroom drama became a public spectacle . Authorities had to charge an entrance fee to control the crowds at the <unk> Sessions Court . The right of admission was also restricted to those literate in English , citing that the mahant 's British lawyer and the judge only spoke in English . 
 The overruling of the Indian jury 's decision by the Sessions Court judge was heavily debated . According to Swati Chattopadhyay ( author of Representing Calcutta : Modernity , Nationalism and the Colonial Uncanny ) , the court proceedings were seen as an interference by the British in local matters . The court represented a conflict between village and city , the priest and <unk> ( Bengali gentleman class ) and the colonial state and nationalist subjects . The court proceedings were disturbed several times by crowds demanding clemency for Nobin or stringency for the mahant . The mahant and his English lawyer were often attacked outside the court . The mahant 's punishment was termed lenient by the Bengali public . Nobin was released in 1875 , following several public petitions for pardon . Such pleas came from members of the Calcutta elite and district town notables , local royals and " acknowledged leaders of native society " , as well as from the " lower middle class " — from whom a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ signature mercy plea was received . 
 The 1873 mahant – Elokeshi incident was not the first incident against a mahant of Tarakeswar . Mahant <unk> Giri was executed in 1824 for the murder of his mistress 's lover . However , according to Sarkar ( author of Hindu wife , Hindu nation ) , while the 1824 scandal hardly created any public outrage and faded quickly from public memory , the 1873 affair was embedded in public memory and created a huge sensation in contemporary Bengal . When a satyagraha was organised against the reigning mahant of Tarakeswar , Satish Giri , in 1974 for his sexual and financial misconduct , the 1873 affair was alluded to several times . 
 A regional daily reported that the mahant 's affair with Elokeshi was still discussed by the common people of Bengal , who did not know of other current affairs , even six months after the murder . Bengali newspapers followed the court trial on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis , often reporting it verbatim and capturing the responses of all parties involved : judges , jury , lawyers and the common man . The " culpability " of each of the characters of the scandal was debated , and British justice and Hindu norms were analysed , especially by British @-@ owned newspapers . While Missionaries interpreted the public outcry against the mahant as the " disenchantment " of the Hindus , British @-@ owned newspapers also pondered over the question of asserting more control on Hindu temples and organisations . In an era when Hindu reform movements were blossoming in Bengal , the scandal led the reformist as well as orthodox society to re @-@ examine " the relationship between Hindu norms , leaders and women " . 
 Many products were specially manufactured to commemorate the event . Saris , fish knives , betel @-@ leaf boxes and other memorabilia with Elokeshi 's name printed or inscribed on them were made . A balm for headache was advertised as using the oil made by the mahant in the jail oil press . Such commemorative items were still in sale in as late as 1894 . These items were unique in the sense that they were the only such commemorative items modelled on an event . 
 = = In the arts = = 
 At least 34 farces were published by the " popular press " on the events of the Tarakeswar affair — the rape , the murder and the trial . At least four of these were reprinted several times . This is the largest number of 19th @-@ century farces in Bengal created in response to a contemporary event . <unk> and plays of the era were often inspired by the real courtroom drama . At least 19 plays were also based on the scandal , all of which became very popular and big money @-@ makers ; especially Mohanter Ei ki Kaj ! became a huge hit on stage . Plays written as late as 1924 referred to the affair as if it was common public knowledge . 
 Numerous Kalighat paintings and <unk> woodwork prints — created in the decade after the scandal — depicted the " immoral " affair , the gruesome murder and the resultant trial . According to Chattopadhyay ( author of Representing Calcutta : modernity , nationalism , and the colonial uncanny ) , it was the popularity of the plays combined with " the rhetoric of sin and morality " that inspired Kalighat painters to present this " tragedy as a spectacle " . Kalighat painters often chose to paint mythological themes and Bengali day @-@ to @-@ day life ; the paintings on the Tarakeswar affair were a unique exception . 
 Often painted as a series , the Kalighat paintings depict various scenes related to the affair : the mahant riding on an elephant howdah ; The Meeting of Elokeshi and the mahant — Elokeshi goes to the temple with her sister and meets the mahant ; The Seduction — Elokeshi offering paan ( betel nut leaf ) , the mahant fans Elokeshi and / or the mahant offering her childbirth medicine in order to drug her before raping her ; Elokeshi embracing Nobin and asking his forgiveness ; the three stages of the murder such as The Fatal / First Blow ( Nobin about to decapitate Elokeshi with a fish knife ) and After the murder ( Nobin with the decapitated body of Elokeshi ) . The Kalighat paintings also depict a courtroom scene of the trial of the mahant followed by the mahant in jail , enduring rigorous labour turning an oil press or working as a jail gardener , while jail guards or the superintendent watch over him . 
 The plays and the paintings suggested the theme of loss of traditional Indian culture in the face of colonialism . 
 = = Assessment and portrayal of the characters = = 
 Most accounts agree that Nobin loved his wife dearly , evidenced by the fact that he was ready to accept his wife at first and run away with her , even after knowledge of the affair . In an era where the chastity of a wife was highly valued , Nobin 's blind love and acceptance of a guilty wife were deemed inappropriate by a large section of society . Her murder was considered justifiable . Some songs criticise Nobin 's stupidity of trying to save his adulterous wife and thereby risking his own life . Police reports , confirming Nobin 's love , read that after the murder , Nobin rushed to the police saying : " Hang me quick . This world is wilderness to me . I am impatient to join my wife in the next [ world / life ] " , a line reported verbatim in newspapers as well as used in plays and songs . Some public petitions argued that given a choice to leave Elokeshi in the arms of the mahant to live a life of dishonour — which was worse than death — and to kill her , like a true husband , Nobin chose the latter to end her misery . However , some plays portray that Nobin has a mistress in town so leaves his wife in the village . 
 Most of the plays were named to suggest the main crime was not Elokeshi 's murder by Nobin , but the immoral activities of the mahant . The mahant is portrayed as the root cause of Elokeshi 's death , which was an " inevitable conclusion " of the mahant ' s activities . Elokeshi , " the object of desire " , had to be killed by Nobin to restore his honour . Titles of such plays reinforce the theme and focus on the mahant 's crime . Examples include : Mohanter <unk> , Mohanter Ki Saja , Mohanter <unk> and Mohanter Ei Ki Dasha . 
 The Kalighat paintings and <unk> woodcuts often depict the mahant as a womaniser and the temple as " a haven for pimps " . He was also described as " a vile seducer " . The Tarakeswar shrine was a famed cure for barren women . The mahant was rumoured to seduce women like Elokeshi who came to him for childbirth medicine and appropriate them with the help of his goons . After being raped , the women could not return to their family and languished in the brothels of Tarakeswar . In most plays , the mahant is described as drugging Elokeshi — by offering fake childbirth medicine — and then raping her . In the play Mohanter <unk> , a rare exception to the general theme of immorality in plays where the mahant misuses Elokeshi , his love is portrayed to be genuine and her seduction by him a resultant after @-@ effect . However , later he is repentant . 
 The <unk> , a reformist newspaper , presents a rare view of the true victim Elokeshi being forgotten in the debate of the trial and sympathy towards Nobin . In the First Meeting painting , Elokeshi is sometimes depicted as a courtesan , indicating that she is the one who seduces the mahant . She is often described as unchaste and to have developed the adulterous affair and even lived with him for some time despite the fact that he first rapes her . In one play , Elokeshi 's character is debated by village wives and prostitutes . The wives vilify Elokeshi as an unchaste woman , question her devotion for Nobin and express the belief that a woman cannot be raped without her consent . The prostitutes empathise with Elokeshi , another victim of male lust and lament her fall from grace , which for them illustrates the brittle status of a wife . Some plays depict Elokeshi as having no choice but to surrender to the mahant 's lust on her father 's command . Such plays concentrate more on scenes where Elokeshi gives in to her father 's orders than on the depiction of rape . 
 One farce depicts a divine trial of not only Elokeshi and the mahant , but also of her parents , who are portrayed as being equally guilty . Elokeshi is condemned for seducing the mahant and tarnishing the name of the holy shrine of Tarakeswar . The mahant is punished for misusing the authority and money of the temple . One newspaper describes Elokeshi 's father as " the still worse scoundrel ( worse than the mahant ) who bartered his daughter 's virtue " . In many plays , Elokeshi 's father , who is now sexually incompetent , is driven by the greed of Elokeshi 's young stepmother and he resorts to pleasing his wife by giving gifts like jewellery , for which he sells off his daughter to the mahant . Elokeshi 's staying at her parents ' home — and not with her husband — is also blamed for their excessive control over her . 
 = NAD 3020 = 
 The NAD 3020 is an iconic stereo integrated amplifier by NAD Electronics , considered to be one of the most important components in the history of high fidelity audio . Launched circa 1978 , this highly affordable product delivered a good quality sound , which acquired a reputation as an audiophile amplifier of exceptional value . By 1998 , the NAD 3020 had become the most well known and best @-@ selling audio amplifier in history . 
 = = History = = 
 Launched circa 1978 – 79 in an era where the principal preoccupation of hi @-@ fi manufacturers was power output , the sub- £ 80 ( US $ 135 ) low @-@ powered solid state amplifier , created and marketed by a then little @-@ known manufacturer , very rapidly acquired a reputation for excellent sound quality and exceptional value . Stereophile magazine called the NAD 3020 " ridiculously inexpensive " . It was the first integrated amplifier built with convincing ability to drive difficult loudspeaker loads , and a sound quality that far exceeded other integrated amplifiers at its price point for the time . 
 In an era when the NAD 's rated power output of 20 watts per channel continuous into 8 ohms was considered anaemic , the manufacturer claimed it could deliver much stronger power output into lower impedances under dynamic conditions ( music or peak power output ) . Indeed , it is capable of delivering 40 watts into 8 ohm , 58 watts into 4 ohm , and 72 watts into 2 ohm loads for a limited time if pushed . The amplifier 's main appeal was its inherent musicality , its ability to drive difficult speaker loads , and to allow audiophile grade source components to excel . Launching the product in the US at the Consumer Electronics Show , the company wired up a battery of loudspeakers in a way which presented an impedance of 1 @.@ 1 ohm , and the amplifier experienced no problems . Similarly , at its London launch , NAD successfully demonstrated it driving the Linn Isobarik , whose impedance characteristics are known to be very challenging for amplifiers . It was the best @-@ known and best @-@ selling amplifier in the annals of hi @-@ fi . The NAD 3020 revolutionised the amplifier segment of the hi @-@ fi industry . 
 = = = Design principles = = = 
 Bjørn Erik Edvardsen , NAD 's director of advanced development , set out to create an " inexpensive amplifier ... easily capable of driving the very best loudspeakers " . NAD eschewed the laboratory test equipment thinking , which was prevalent at the time , and instead aimed to make their amplifiers capable of properly driving " real loudspeakers " under realistic conditions . This paradigm shift gave rise to an amplifier that cost less and sounded better . NAD was able to achieve a low cost base by foreign manufacture . The company designed the product in Europe and had it produced in factories in Taiwan – it was one of the first manufacturers to de @-@ localise production to Asia . 
 The design , and models following it , included " soft @-@ clipping circuitry " that protects against over @-@ driven signals , connections that allow splitting of the power amplifier section from the preamplifier , a button to bypass tone controls , and " Full Disclosure " power ratings measuring output power under real @-@ world loads . 
 = = = = Audio circuitry = = = = 
 The NAD 3020 has four inputs that can be switched via the front panel – Aux , Tuner , Phono , Tape . The manufacturer claims the phono input , which can also be used with high @-@ output moving coil cartridges , contains a 6 @-@ transistor circuit " engineered for extremely low noise and nearly distortion @-@ free performance " . Reviewers note the pre @-@ amplifier 's " decent moving @-@ magnet phono stage " . The amplifier is bandwidth @-@ limited , incorporating infrasonic and ultrasonic filters to supposedly reduce the effects of non @-@ musical signals such as acoustic feedback , disc warps and electromagnetic interference on the musical signals . 
 The amplifier has bass and treble tone controls which , according to the manufacturer , are " tailored for musically effective response in the high and low frequencies without altering the critical mid @-@ range tonal balance " . A loudness switch – de rigueur in that era – boosts upper and lower frequencies ; a " mute " switch reduces volume by 20 dB for low @-@ level listening . There is also a headphone socket mounted onto the front panel . 
 According to the manufacturer , the NAD 3020 is a high voltage design that uses the same large powerful output transistors that " other manufacturers employ in their ' 60 @-@ watt ' amplifiers " , enabling the amplifier to deliver power headroom for musical transients . Although the " Soft Clipping " circuitry limits the output voltage so that the transistors do not distort when driven beyond its rated power , Lucio Cadeddu of TNT considers this protection and the tone @-@ shaping circuitry to be unnecessary and advises users to avoid them " like the plague " . 
 The innovative split of pre- and power @-@ amplifier sections allows the use of the pre @-@ amp stage to drive multiple power amplifiers in parallel , or use long signal cables to connect to remote power amplifiers or powered speakers . This faculty became hugely popular with audiophiles , who would seek to isolate this " remarkably fine @-@ sounding preamp section " , to use with one or more external power amplifiers . 
 = = = = Power source = = = = 
 The amplifier has what the manufacturer calls a " dual @-@ mode power supply " , where the output stage is only loosely regulated , so it is free to supply the high voltages needed for musical transients and the large currents at lower voltages needed for driving low @-@ impedance loads in the power amplifier circuitry . The design also incorporates a separate regulated power supply circuit , fed from a secondary winding on the transformer , dedicated to the pre @-@ amplifier and tone control stages . It is thus claimed that <unk> distortion and blurring of the stereo image due to power supply functioning cannot occur . 
 = = = = Styling = = = = 
 The styling of the NAD 3020 resembled that of other budget amplifiers of the time , and it was available in charcoal grey or silver . Stereophile commented that it was " inexpensive and looked it " . Although Cadeddu criticised the amplifier as " ugly , cheap and with a poor level of finishing " , he said that " the components used were fair but , clearly , the man behind its design knew what he was doing pretty well " . 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 The highly popular NAD 3020 is considered one of the most important hi @-@ fi components in the history of home audio . Sonically , it benefited from a design error where crosstalk between left and right channels presented better detail and more ambiance ; the error was corrected in a later guise . Its sound is described by reviewers as dark and warm , with a " sweet and sensual midrange " ; some reviewers observed a very noticeable rolling off at frequency extremes that may detract from sonic neutrality , and that its soundstage lacked precision but it was universally praised for its value for money . The amplifier was a hot seller , and the NAD 3020 alone achieved a record 1 @.@ 1 million units in its lifetime . The figure would be much higher if the sales of other amplifiers derived directly from its design are included . The quality made possible at a £ 79 ( US $ 133 ) price tag opened up the market for budget yet quality amplifiers , and spawned similarly low @-@ priced competitors such as <unk> Alpha , <unk> 840 , Mission Cyrus I , Pioneer <unk> , Denon PMA 350 and <unk> <unk> SE . In 2002 it ranked No. 19 in list of " The Hot 100 Products " by Stereophile . In 2011 , The Absolute Sound placed it at No. 9 in their list of " The Ten Most Significant Amplifiers of All Time " . The Absolute Sound remarked that this " iconic gem could embarrass amplifiers costing 10 times more with its big , warm and detailed sound and best of all , its affordable price made it available to a wider audience . " 
 A retrospective review by Chris Martens said that the 3020 was not perfect , and while it may have been surpassed by other components according to other performance criteria individually , it was " better than any $ 200 integrated amp had any right to be " . Martens complimented the quality of the electronic circuit design , noting in particular that the phono stage " sounded clearer and better balanced than many dedicated <unk> of the day " . 
 = = = Spin @-@ offs and legacy = = = 
 The NAD 3020 sold half a million units in the first three years of its life , and the second @-@ generation NAD <unk> replacing it , which corrected some minor design errors , proved even more popular than its predecessor . 
 Variants included NAD <unk> , NAD <unk> . An " almost identical " audiophile version dubbed NAD <unk> , stripped of tone controls and with higher quality loudspeaker binding posts , was released . The NAD <unk> is an " improved " version of the NAD 3020 that retailed at £ 149 ( US $ 250 ) when it was launched in 1991 . The NAD 7020 receiver ( tuner @-@ amplifier ) , that included the amplification circuitry of the NAD 3020 , received a mixed reception due to severe reliability issues . Following its release , and upon realisation that the product was much sought after for its pre @-@ amplifier section , a preamp version of the NAD 3020 was released under the name NAD 1020 . 
 In 2013 , the 40th year of the company , NAD launched a range of digital products , including a digital amplifier bearing the name NAD D 3020 . 
 = Stanisław Żółkiewski = 
 Stanisław Żółkiewski ( 1547 – 1620 ) was a Polish nobleman of the <unk> coat of arms , magnate and military commander of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , who took part in many campaigns of the Commonwealth and on its southern and eastern borders . He occupied a number of high @-@ ranking posts in the administration of the Commonwealth , including castellan of L 'viv ( from 1590 ) , <unk> of the Kiev Voivodeship and Great Chancellor of the Crown ( from 1618 ) . From 1588 he was also a Field Crown Hetman , and in 1613 was promoted to Grand Hetman of the Crown . During his military career he won major battles against Sweden , Muscovy , the Ottoman Empire and the Tatars . 
 Żółkiewski 's best @-@ known victory was against combined Russian and Swedish forces at the battle of Klushino in 1610 , in the aftermath of which the Poles seized and occupied Moscow . He died in the 1620 battle of Cecora against the Ottomans , after allegedly refusing to retreat . Already renowned as a military leader , Żółkiewski 's heroic death further boosted his fame . He is seen as one of the most accomplished military commanders in the history of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth .

 = = = Youth = = = 
 Stanisław Żółkiewski was born in the village of <unk> in 1547 to Stanisław Żółkiewski of the <unk> coat of arms , voivode of Ruthenia , and Zofia <unk> . The exact date of his birth is unknown , and even the year is disputed : most sources agree on 1547 , although a few suggest 1550 . 
 Żółkiewski attended a cathedral school in Lwów ( now L 'viv , Ukraine ) . Unlike many of his peers he had no higher education and did not travel abroad . However , he pursued studies on his own and was particularly interested in history and historical literature . In 1566 he joined the court of King Sigismund II Augustus , as an aid to the king 's secretary Jan Zamoyski . There he became familiar with the <unk> movement , which advocated numerous reforms including military ones . In 1573 he took part in the diplomatic mission to France , sent to meet a newly elected king Henry III of France , and on his way back he was sent to Vienna to appease the Habsburgs . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Żółkiewski gained his first military experience under King Stefan Batory during the Danzig rebellion in which he commanded a rota of Polish hussars . He subsequently participated in Batory 's Livonian campaign , fighting at Polotsk , <unk> ( Sokół ) , Velizh and at the Siege of Pskov . Żółkiewski maintained his political alliance with the Zamoyski family after those campaigns ended , particularly in their conflict with the <unk> . On the night of 11 to 12 May 1584 he captured Samuel Zborowski , whose subsequent execution caused much controversy . Żółkiewski became notorious for his role in the incident , and was the subject of heated debates during the Sejm of 1585 . 
 In 1588 , during the War of the Polish Succession between factions of Sigismund III Vasa and Maximilian III , Żółkiewski supported Sigismund . Żółkiewski commanded the right flank of Commonwealth forces in the battle of Byczyna , during which he received a knee wound that lamed him for the remainder of his life . For his part in the battle he was appointed a Field Crown Hetman , and became the starost of Hrubieszów . 
 = = = As Field Crown Hetman = = = 
 Soon after becoming a Hetman , Żółkiewski was sent to Ukraine to repel a Tatar invasion . In 1590 he became the castellan of Lwów , but his requests for military reinforcements against the Tatars went unheeded . 
 In 1595 Żółkiewski participated in the Moldavian campaign and the battle of Cecora near the Prut river . The following year he defeated the Cossack uprising of Severyn Nalivaiko . Żółkiewski was a known supporter of Cossack grievances , and generally favored peaceful negotiations with them . When the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and other leaders of the uprising to him he guaranteed their fair treatment . But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in Warsaw , and a mob of Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners , which led to a deterioration in Polish @-@ Cossack relations . In 1600 Żółkiewski returned to Moldova , where he took part in the victorious battle of <unk> . 
 In 1601 Żółkiewski operated in the north , in Livonia ( Inflanty ) , during the Polish – Swedish War . He also took part in the successful siege of Wolmar , and in 1602 the taking of Fellin . That same year he led Polish forces at the battle of Reval , which led to a Swedish capitulation at the siege of Biały Kamień . Żólkiewski became ill near the end of the campaign and had to relinquish command of his forces to Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz . 
 In 1606 Żółkiewski returned to Ukraine , where he defeated the Tatars at the battle of <unk> . Later that year he decided to support the king during the Zebrzydowski 's Rebellion . His decision was not an obvious one , as his mentor Zamoyski opposed the king . Additionally , Żółkiewski was related to the Zebrzydowski family and was sympathetic to some of the rebels ' arguments . In the battle of Guzów he commanded the left flank of the royal forces , but his troops took relatively little part in the battle . Unimpressed with Żółkiewski 's performance , the king did not give him not the Grand Crown <unk> that he coveted , although he was appointed to the office of the voivode of Kiev . 
 In the second half of 1609 Żółkiewski took part in the Polish – Muscovite War ( also known as the Dymitriads ) . He supported the election of Władysław IV Vasa for the tsar of Russia and the idea of a personal union between the Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia ( the Polish @-@ Muscovite union ) . During the De la Gardie Campaign in 1610 he achieved another significant victory against combined Russian and Swedish forces at the battle of Klushino . As a result of his successful campaign Żółkiewski seized Moscow and captured the tsar Vasiliy Shuyskiy and his brothers , Ivan Shuyskiy and Dmitri Shuyskiy . Zygmunt rejected Żółkiewski 's political plan however , which would have required Władysław to convert to Orthodoxy . 
 Żółkiewski began to write his memoirs after his return from Muscovy . The <unk> i progres wojny <unk> ( The beginning and Progress of the Muscovy War ) , published in 1612 , is a critique of Zygmunt 's policies . In 1612 he became a teacher and tutor of Stanisław Koniecpolski , future hetman and military commander . Also that year he returned to Ukraine to defend against continuing Tatar and Moldovan incursions , as well as Cossack unrest . In 1616 during a Sejm he presented a project O <unk> <unk> <unk> ( On the raising of the kwarciane soldiers ) , in which he argued for the need to raise a larger army to deal with the Tatars and the Cossacks . The project was however not approved by the parliament . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 Żółkiewski 's popularity waned in the latter years of his career . He was accused of not supporting Samuel Korecki during the battle of <unk> <unk> in 1616 , of signing the Treaty of <unk> ( Busza ) in 1617 which relinquished influence in some borderlands to Moldova and the Ottoman Empire ; and of failing to stop the Tatars at the battle of <unk> in 1618 . But in 1618 he finally received his coveted <unk> of the Grand Crown Hetman , and shortly afterwards the office of Grand Crown Chancellor . He was thus for a brief period the most powerful individual in the Commonwealth after the king , a position he reached not through wealth or family but by military achievement and reputation . 
 Despite being more than 70 years old , Żółkiewski continued in active service as a military commander until the very end . He died on 7 October 1620 , during the Commonwealth 's retreat after the battle of Cecora against the Turks , during the Polish – Ottoman War ( 1620 – 1621 ) which marked the end of the Moldavian campaigns . The battle comprised several engagements , in which Polish forces were routed . During the last rout Żólkiewski was killed ; according to an anecdote he refused to retreat , preferring to stay with the rear guard till the very end . Before his death he received the blessing of his confessor , Father Szymon <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) of the Society of Jesus , who stood fearlessly at his side ( 7 October ) . { see painting " Battle of Cecora ( 1620 ) " by Walery <unk> <unk> } 
 After the battle Żółkiewski 's corpse was desecrated by the removal of its head and sent to Constantinople as a trophy of war . His widow bought his body from the Turks and ransomed their son , who had been captured during the battle . Żółkiewski was buried in St Lawrence Church in Żółkiew ( now <unk> , Ukraine ) , the town he enlarged and where he built the Żółkiew Castle . 
 = = Remembrance = = 
 Żółkiewski 's heroic death – portrayed in several works of art by contemporaries such as <unk> <unk> and Stanisław <unk> – boosted his reputation and guaranteed him a place among the pantheon of the most famous of Polish military commanders . In the years following his death he was mentioned in the works of writers such as Stefan Żeromski , Józef Szujski , Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Maria Konopnicka . Up to the present day , the story of his death is the best remembered aspect of his life , with a number of sources discussing the " legend of Żółkiewski " . 
 A monument was built at the site of Żółkiewski 's death ( now in <unk> in <unk> District , Moldova ) by his son Jan , in 1621 . It is inscribed with a motto from Horace : " Quam dulce et decorum est pro patria mori " ( How sweet and fitting it is to die for one 's country ) . The monument was destroyed in 1868 , rebuilt in 1912 , and renovated in 2003 . It is a venue for events organized by the Polish minority in Moldova . 
 In 1903 a statue of Żółkiewski was built in <unk> , but it was demolished in 1939 by Soviet troops in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Poland . In modern Poland <unk> is celebrated as a military hero , but modern Russia 's Unity Day instead celebrates the anniversary of the surrender of the Polish forces he installed in the Moscow garrison .

 Keating ! is a musical which portrays the political career of former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating . Keating was Prime Minister between 1991 to 1996 ; the musical follows him from his ascent to the leadership through to his eventual electoral defeat by John Howard . It was written by Casey Bennetto , who was inspired to write the show by his disappointment at the results of the 2004 federal election , which saw Howard 's Coalition government returned for a fourth term . The musical takes a humorous , satirical tone and presents a positive image of Keating while frequently criticising the Howard government . Bennetto describes the show as " ridiculously pro @-@ Paul Keating " . 
 Originally performed by musical group the Drowsy Drivers , the show achieved rapid success from its low @-@ budget premiere at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival where it enjoyed a sold @-@ out run and won an unprecedented three festival awards . In 2006 , Neil Armfield directed an extended Company B production of Keating ! , now with two acts and six new songs written by Bennetto . The Company B production toured Australia , receiving favourable reviews and winning Helpmann Awards for Best Musical and Best Regional Touring Production . In 2008 a live recording of the show was broadcast nationally on ABC2 ; it was released on DVD in November 2008 , through Madman Entertainment . 
 = = Background = = 
 Paul Keating was a Labor Prime Minister of Australia from 1991 to 1996 , ascending to the office after two leadership challenges against his predecessor , Bob Hawke . As Prime Minister , he was interested in a " big picture " approach to government , engaging with issues such as a closer relationship with Asia , Aboriginal reconciliation and the formation of an Australian republic . His government was defeated in the 1996 federal election by the Liberal @-@ National coalition under John Howard . Writer Casey Bennetto was inspired to write a musical about Keating following his disappointment at the result of the 2004 federal election , which saw the Howard government returned for a fourth term . " It was time to have a laugh at it , " he said . He says Keating 's story appealed to him because of its classic dramatic structure , that of a man who struggles , " makes it to the top " and must compete against " three bad guys " — successive Opposition leaders John Hewson , Alexander Downer and John Howard . Bennetto believed Keating 's colourful personality made him an " ideal " character for musical theatre , citing the former Prime Minister 's reputation for being sharp @-@ tongued , wearing <unk> suits and collecting antique clocks . Bennetto wrote the show in eight weeks , drawing on Keating biography Recollections of a Bleeding Heart by Don Watson . He describes it as a " ridiculously pro @-@ Paul Keating " piece which ultimately aims to be funny and entertaining . 
 = = Production history = = 
 Originally performed by musical group the Drowsy Drivers , Keating ! premiered at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival as a low @-@ budget , single @-@ act show in a 100 @-@ seat venue at the Melbourne Trades Hall . Mike McLeish played the lead role , with Bennetto as " the three Hs – Hawke , Hewson and Howard " , Enio Pozzebon as Gareth Evans and Cam Rogers as Alexander Downer . Despite the musical 's success in Melbourne , Bennetto did not have any plans for Keating ! after the end of the comedy festival . However , producer Catherine Woodfield ( Bennetto 's partner and Trades Hall publican ) insisted they develop it further . Between 2005 and 2006 they took it on tour across Australia , including a week of shows in the Sydney Opera House , a return season at Melbourne 's Trades Hall , a two @-@ week season at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival , a week of shows at the Brisbane Powerhouse and two nights in Darwin . 
 Also in 2006 , renowned director Neil Armfield offered to direct a production of Keating ! at Sydney 's Belvoir St Theatre with Company B. For the Company B production Bennetto reworked the musical into a two @-@ act piece , writing six new songs for the show . Of the original cast , only McLeish , Pozzebon and Bennetto were retained ; McLeish returned as Keating and Pozzebon as Evans , while Bennetto took on the roles of Hewson and Downer . Terry Serio joined the cast as Hawke and Howard . Bennetto says that both he and McLeish were worried that Armfield would turn " relatively simply staged , roughly hewn " musical into " the Amadeus version " without the original show 's sense of fun , but instead felt it became a " more accomplished , buffed @-@ up version of the original show " . 
 The Company B version of Keating ! enjoyed sold @-@ out seasons in Melbourne , Sydney , Adelaide , Brisbane , Perth , Canberra , Wollongong , Albany and elsewhere ( including a run of shows at the 2007 Melbourne International Comedy Festival ) before coming to a close on 31 August 2008 . On 20 August 2008 , ABC2 broadcast a live performance of the show from Sydney 's Seymour Centre . The recording was released on DVD by Madman Entertainment in November 2008 . 
 = = Response = = 
 The premiere of the Drowsy Drivers ' production at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival was met with enthusiastic reviews . Comedian Chris Addison praised the musical as " the best show I 've seen at this festival in five years " and The Age 's Daniel <unk> described it as " clever and superbly funny " . Within the first week it had become one of the most popular shows of the festival , having sold out by the fifth show . By the end of its Melbourne run , the show had won three major festival awards — the Barry , The Age Critics ' Award and the Golden <unk> — the first time any production had ever done so . For the songs of Keating ! , Bennetto won both the 2006 Helpmann and Green Room Awards for best original musical score . 
 The Company B version also received strong reviews , with a writer in Brisbane 's Courier @-@ Mail describing it as " brilliantly satirical " and a reviewer in Melbourne 's Age awarding it the top rating of five stars . However Paul Sheehan , writing for the Sydney Morning Herald , criticised the musical 's pro @-@ Keating bias , calling the script " preachy and safe " and an insult to those who voted for Howard . In 2007 it won the Helpmann Award for Best Musical , as well as the awards for best direction for Armfield and best actor in a supporting role for Serio . The following year it won another Helpmann for best regional touring production . By the end of its 2007 Sydney season , it had taken $ 500 @,@ 000 in box office earnings , and by its final show in 2008 its total audience had reached over 223 @,@ 000 people across Australia . 
 Keating , who has attended the show multiple times , believes that it is popular because politics and public life today are without humour . " The game is very dour , " he says , " But satire can get a lot across . It can cut out the humbug . " He believes another reason is an increased interest in the unsettled issues in the national debate , such as the question of a republic . Downer has also seen the show and commented afterwards that he enjoys satire and thought " Keating ! the musical was far better than Keating the prime minister . " 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The following summary refers to the extended , two @-@ act version of the musical . 
 = = = Act One = = = 
 Sung @-@ through , the production begins with Bob Hawke introducing the political situation of 1990 and the contrasting personalities of Hawke — with his enthusiasm for " footy " and cricket — and his deputy , Paul Keating , who is fond of " the works of Mahler " ( " My Right Hand Man " ) . While Hawke admires Keating 's economic prowess , he is perplexed by the other man 's " un @-@ Australian " interests . Keating emerges and shares some of his life story and his hopes to gain the leadership from Hawke as they had agreed to in a deal known as the Kirribilli Accord for the venue at which it was reached ( " Do It In Style " ) . However , Hawke reneges on the deal and Keating returns to the back bench . In a rock ballad , vaguely in the style of Queen , he sings of his desolation before resolving to challenge for the Prime Ministership ( " I Remember Kirribilli " ) . He confronts Hawke with the blue @-@ eyed soul @-@ style " It 's Time " ; the song refers to the name of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam 's famous 1970s campaign and uses Keating 's fondness for collecting antique clocks as a motif for his belief that it is indeed time for a change of leadership . Keating becomes Prime Minister and sings of his ambitions for the nation — including a treaty with Australian Aborigines , an Australian republic and improved relationships with Australia 's Asian neighbours — in a reggae song ( " Ruler Of The Land " ) . 
 As Keating celebrates his success , Gareth Evans cautions that the political life of a Prime Minister is limited in the minor @-@ key Latin tune " The Beginning Is The End " . Both he and the ghost of Gough Whitlam counsel Keating to " maintain your rage " . Keating then faces off against Opposition Leader John Hewson in a freestyle rap battle , arguing over the merits of Hewson 's " <unk> ! " policy platform , with Keating winning the battle due to his superior command of colourful invective , much of which is drawn from actual Keating quotes ( " On The Floor " ) . Angered , Hewson challenges Keating to call an early election , but Keating refuses in the song " I Wanna Do You Slowly " . The song 's title again refers to a well @-@ known Keating quote , but takes on a sexual interpretation in the slow , Barry White @-@ style funk number . The Keating government contests the 1993 federal election , and in an animated video Kerry O 'Brien , Michael Kroger , Robert Ray and Antony Green report on the incoming results in scat over ukulele ( " Antony Green " ) . Labor wins , and Keating sings about the unexpected victory as " the sweetest victory of all " , using a famous phrase from his actual election night speech ( " Sweet " ) . 
 = = = Act Two = = = 
 In the ska tune " The Arse End Of The Earth " , which refers to Keating 's private description of Australia , both Keating and Evans complain about the day @-@ to @-@ day issues of the economy and their unfavourable portrayal in the commercial media getting in the way of their larger agenda , including republicanism , a new flag , and Aboriginal reconciliation . Alexander Downer replaces Hewson as Opposition Leader for a short and unsuccessful period . In a costume of fishnets , corsetry and lipstick that alludes to a photograph of the actual Downer posing in fishnet stockings for a competition , he sings his belief that he is just " too freaky " for the leadership ( " Freaky " ) . Meanwhile , Evans has an extramarital affair with Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot ( typically played by a male ) ( " Heavens , Mister Evans " ) . In an understated minor @-@ key bossa nova song , Keating sings of the need to recognise and apologise for the damage done by white colonisation and subsequent subjugation of the Australian Aboriginal population ( " Redfern " ) , before segueing into a more upbeat mambo about the Mabo decision by the High Court of Australia and his attempts to use the decision to promote a reconciliation agenda ( " Ma ( m ) bo " ) . 
 John Howard becomes leader of the Opposition , presenting a new threat to Keating . Howard describes his intense desire for power and his thirst for revenge against the petty humiliations put on him as a child in a menacing minor @-@ key march ( " Power " ) . However , in the media he presents himself as " a normal bloke and nothing more " ( " The <unk> " ) . Through various costume changes , he attempts to cast himself as a sports fan , a friend of the Australian soldier and a farmer , though the song implies that these are only costumes . The song also refers to the " children overboard " affair , his criticism of political correctness , and his use of immigration as a political issue , some of which occurred after the actual Howard 's subsequent election to Prime Minister . In a slow rock duet , Keating and Howard both beseech voters to " Choose Me " . However , as the 1996 electoral polls close , Keating concludes that he is doomed electorally . He sings of his <unk> dreams and with some bitterness at what he sees as the backward @-@ looking message of his opponent in a country @-@ influenced ballad referring to former Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley 's description of Labor 's overarching goals ( " The Light On The Hill " ) . 
 In the final number , " Historical Revisionism " , the election tightens dramatically and the results come to hang on a single polling booth — the theatre in which the musical is playing . Keating wins and Howard concedes with the line " Well , I 'm sorry ... that I lost ! " ( a reference to his unwillingness to support a formal apology to the Aboriginal people ) . As the song 's title indicates , the actual Keating did not win the 1996 election . The song segues into a reprise of " Ruler Of The Land " . 
 = = Music = = 
 The songs of Keating ! employ a wide range of musical styles , including bossa nova , blues , rap , reggae , soul , swing and beer @-@ barrel waltz . Mara <unk> Davis has written a highly readable and entertaining academic study of Casey Bennetto 's " Keating ! " as a generic hybrid - deftly blending vaudeville , theatre and musical comedy ( " " <unk> the Switch : Vaudeville Traditions and Myth @-@ Making in Keating ! " in Sydney Undergraduate Journal of Musicology , Vol . 5 , December 2015 ) . The lyrics frequently draw on quotes from the real Keating and other political figures , particularly in " On The Floor " which contains numerous verbatim quotes from Keating 's debates with Hewson . In expanding the show for the Company B production Bennetto wrote six new songs , adding an Act One " curtain " number ( " Sweet " ) , an exploration of Keating 's time in office ( " The Arse End Of The Earth " ) , two songs on Aboriginal reconciliation and native title ( " Redfern " and " Ma ( m ) bo " ) and another song for Howard ( " The <unk> " ) . " Dogs Of Damnation " , a song from the original version in which Evans warns Keating that his political life is limited , was replaced by the similarly themed " The Beginning Is The End " . 
 A live recording of the original single @-@ act version played at the Sydney Opera House was released in 2006 by Bella Union Enterprises and is available through the Drowsy Drivers ' Keating ! website . In 2007 Company B released a cast recording of the extended show containing all of the musical numbers featured on stage except for " Antony Green " . The CD features the Company B production 's original cast , with McLeish as Keating , Serio as Hawke and Howard , Bennetto as Hewson and Downer , Pozzebon as Evans and Mick Stuart as Kernot . The band consists of Alon <unk> ( drums ) , Eden <unk> ( bass ) , Pozzebon ( keyboards ) , Guy <unk> ( acoustic guitar ) and Mick Stuart ( electric guitar ) . By 2008 , the CD had sold over 5 @,@ 000 copies . Also that year , a live recording of the extended version was performed at Sydney ’ s Seymour Centre . Among the audience members who attended the recording , the real @-@ life Keating and Cheryl Kernot made an appearance . The recording is currently available on DVD .

 Robert White ( February 7 , 1833 – December 12 , 1915 ) was an American military officer , lawyer , and politician in the U.S. state of West Virginia . White served as Attorney General of West Virginia ( 1877 – 1881 ) and served two terms in the West Virginia House of Delegates , representing Ohio County in 1885 and 1891 . 
 Born in 1833 in Romney , Virginia ( present @-@ day West Virginia ) , White was the son of Hampshire County Court Clerk John Baker White and his second wife , Frances Ann Streit White . He was educated at the Romney Classical Institute , worked in his father 's clerking office for six years , and studied jurisprudence under John White Brockenbrough at his Lexington Law School . White was admitted to the bar in 1854 and practiced law in Romney . 
 Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War , White was commissioned a Captain of the Frontier Riflemen , which later became Company I of the 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment , commanded by Colonel A. P. Hill in 1861 . In 1864 , he was commissioned as a Colonel in command of the 23rd Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and served in that capacity until the unit disbanded in April 1865 . Following the war , White returned to Romney and practiced law with John Jeremiah Jacob .

White was one of nine members to revive the Romney Literary Society following the war , and in 1870 , the organization successfully secured the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind for Romney . He served three terms on the school 's Board of Regents . White also established the South Branch Railway Company and was its president until 1877 . 
 White was elected as West Virginia 's attorney general in 1876 and served from 1877 until 1881 . He was charged with several important lawsuits , among the most prominent being the state 's pursuance of tax liabilities from railroad companies . White argued the case before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia , which ruled in White 's favor and ultimately enriched the West Virginia state treasury . He successfully secured the extradition of Elihu Gregg from Pennsylvania after Gregg was accused of burning the Preston County courthouse and fled . In Kitzmiller v. Williams , White argued in favor of the rights of former Confederate soldiers before the Supreme Court of the United States and secured a favorable verdict . Following his tenure as attorney general , White served two terms in the West Virginia House of Delegates . In 1885 , he represented the state at the Washington Monument 's dedication . White subsequently served two terms as the city solicitor of Wheeling , and was later counsel for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company . 
 In his later life , White was involved in Confederate memorial activities . He was a member of the Confederate Memorial Association board of trustees , the chief officer of the West Virginia Division of the United Confederate Veterans , and served as commander with the rank of major @-@ general in the national organization . White was chairman of the construction committee for the Confederate Memorial Institute 's Battle Abbey in Richmond . He was a Freemason and served as Grand Master of the state of West Virginia in 1875 .

 In 1860 , following John Brown 's raid on Harpers Ferry in October 1859 , a Virginia uniformed volunteer military company known as the Frontier Riflemen was formed with White as commanding officer in the rank of Captain . Following the outbreak of the Civil War , Governor John Letcher ordered the Frontier Riflemen to report to Lieutenant General Stonewall Jackson at Harpers Ferry . White and his unit marched to Harpers Ferry on May 18 , 1861 . He and his unit traveled north on the Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad mainline at Green Spring , then to Harpers Ferry . Following their arrival , White 's company was reassigned as Company I of the 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment commanded by Colonel A. P. Hill . The company marched from Harpers Ferry to Winchester and returned to Romney in June 1861 , at which time they occupied the town for several days . 
 A detachment under White 's command , consisting of White 's Company I , Company K , and the 1st Tennessee , were then sent to New Creek to destroy railroad bridges . The detachment successfully burned the bridges , after which it engaged in a skirmish with the Cumberland Home Guards . White 's forces defeated the guards and captured two cannons , their first trophies of war . Colonel Hill marched to Winchester , and Company I then came under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston . 
 During the Winter of 1861 – 62 , White was reassigned to the ordnance department and served in that capacity until 1863 , when he was authorized to raise and command a battalion of cavalry . White formed the 41st Battalion Virginia Cavalry in September 1863 and continued to serve as the battalion 's commanding officer until seven of its companies were consolidated with two companies of O <unk> 's Battalion Virginia Cavalry to form the 23rd Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment in April 1864 . White was then commissioned as a Colonel in command of the cavalry regiment and served in that capacity until the unit disbanded in April 1865 .

 During the war , White 's father left Romney with his wife and youngest children and traveled to Richmond . There he served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury within the government of the President of the Confederate States of America , Jefferson Davis . White 's father , John Baker White , died soon after his arrival in Richmond on October 9 , 1862 .

 Following the war , White returned to Romney . On account of his father 's death during the war and White being the eldest son , he became his family 's patriarch and resumed practicing law to provide for them . In 1865 , he entered into a practice with John Jeremiah Jacob until Jacob began his tenure as Governor of West Virginia in 1871 . White then expanded his law practice and it became the largest of its kind in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia . He continued his law practice until 1877 , when he became Attorney General of West Virginia . 
 White devoted his efforts to bringing economic development to the South Branch Potomac River Valley , which had been devastated during the course of the American Civil War and remained undeveloped during the Reconstruction Era . In an effort to rebuild his hometown , Romney , following the war , White sought to first memorialize the Confederate war dead . Early in the Spring of 1866 , a meeting was held at White 's home in Romney with his wife Ellen E. Vass White , his brother Christian Streit White , Elizabeth " Bessie " Jane Schultze ( later Mrs. Christian Streit White ) , and his sister Frances " Fannie " Ann Armstrong White ( later Mrs. Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy ) . Following this meeting , an inspired group of Hampshire County women assembled and adopted a constitution for the Confederate Memorial Association , of which White 's wife served as a president . Through the association 's efforts , the first decoration of Confederate graves at Indian Mound Cemetery took place on June 1 , 1866 . The association sponsored the construction of the Confederate Memorial at Indian Mound Cemetery , which was dedicated on September 26 , 1867 . 
 On May 15 , 1869 , nine members of the Romney Literary Society , including White , commenced an effort to revive the society 's activities and reconstitute its library , which had been destroyed during the war . When the state of West Virginia first founded an institution for deaf and blind students , White helped to pass the legislative act that established the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind . On April 20 , 1870 , during a meeting of the schools ' Board of Regents , in Wheeling , White and Andrew Wodrow Kercheval were sent by the Romney Literary Society to make a formal offer of the Romney Classical Institute buildings and grounds to the board . Through White 's efforts , the school was established on the former campus of the Romney Classical Institute in Romney , where it remains as of 2015 . 
 White was subsequently appointed to serve three terms on the schools ' Board of Regents . White was appointed to the Board of Regents ' first ( 1870 ) , second ( 1871 – 1873 ) , and third ( 1874 – 1876 ) terms , and served as its secretary each time . In his report to Governor William E. Stevenson at the close of the institutions ' first school year , in 1871 , White wrote : " The board has to express its entire satisfaction with the present flourishing condition of the institution . The discipline , the progress of the pupils in their studies and their general improvement , deserve the highest commendation and entitle our deaf and dumb and blind institution to the unstinted patronage of the state . " 
 In addition to his appointments to the schools ' Board of Regents , White was also appointed by the West Virginia Legislature to the state boards of trustees of Capon Springs and Berkeley Springs . He resigned his position on the board of trustees of Berkeley Springs , but he remained a member of Capon Springs 's board until at least 1897 . 
 White also created a railway line linking Romney with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad mainline at Green Spring . He established the South Branch Railway Company to accomplish this and served as the company 's president for several years until relocating to Wheeling in 1877 . Through his efforts , the means and finances were raised to construct the railway .

 = = = Attorney General of West Virginia = = = 
 White was a lifelong member of the Democratic Party . In 1876 , White was nominated at the West Virginia Democratic Party Convention held in Charleston as the party 's candidate for Attorney General of West Virginia despite not expressing interest in the position . That November , White was elected to the office by the largest majority won by politician in West Virginia up until that time . At the time of his election , the state 's capital was Wheeling and on April 1 , 1877 , he relocated there with his family to serve in his post . On the morning of his departure from Romney , the residents of the community bid White farewell by turning out with two brass bands and escorting White and his family to the outskirts of town . There , an address was delivered by one of Romney 's elder residents , and the White family left for Wheeling . 
 During his tenure as attorney general , White was in charge of several important lawsuits , among the most prominent being the state 's pursuance of tax liabilities from railroad companies . Prior to his election as attorney general , railroads had never paid taxes in the state of West Virginia . White instituted proceedings to tax all the railroads within the state . The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company obtained an injunction against the levying of the taxes , leading to a judicial test case . White argued the case first in the lower courts , and then before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia , which ruled in White 's favor . The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the ruling of the state supreme court , which compelled the railroads to pay taxes to the state , ultimately enriching the West Virginia state treasury . 
 White also played prominent role in his position as attorney general during the case of Elihu Gregg . Gregg had been convicted by the Preston County Circuit Court of burning the county courthouse and the public records therein , and also of burning the <unk> who had been sleeping in the courthouse at the time of the fire . Gregg was sentenced to death for these crimes , but following his sentence , he escaped to Greene County , Pennsylvania to the company of his friends and supporters , as the Gregg family was prominent in the region . 
 Requisition was made by West Virginia Governor Henry Mason Mathews , and White was subsequently requested to appear before Pennsylvania Governor John F. Hartranft to argue for Gregg 's extradition back to West Virginia . White was successful in his argument and Governor Hartranft issued an order of extradition . Gregg immediately obtained writ of habeas corpus and was brought before the Green County Court presided over by Judge Wilson of Fayette County , Pennsylvania . 
 White traveled to the Green County Courthouse where he was met by an infuriated mob of Gregg 's friends and supporters who had been awaiting the attorney 's appearance . The mob then threatened to lynch White for attempting to return Gregg to West Virginia to carry out his sentence . White was informed of these threats by a friend , and was advised to leave town quietly . White responded by stating that he had a duty to perform and would perform it " if it were the will of a higher power , " and if not , he would die in his attempt to secure right and justice . White made his way to the courthouse , and by a few well @-@ chosen remarks , secured the attention of the crowd . White depicted Gregg 's crime in detail , during which time he was reportedly on his feet for five hours and twenty minutes . After which , Gregg was extradited back to West Virginia . 
 White was associated with another high profile case , Kitzmiller v. Williams , which involved the belligerent rights of former Confederate soldiers . The case was on appeal from the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia , and White argued the case before the United States Supreme Court , securing a favorable verdict . The case was significant as even though hundreds of similar cases had been previously fought , it was not until this point that the rights of former Confederate soldiers were recognized . 
 During his term as attorney general , White maintained a private law office on <unk> Street in Wheeling . White declined to accept a reelection to the office of West Virginia Attorney General .

 Following his tenure as West Virginia Attorney General , White served two terms in the West Virginia House of Delegates representing Ohio County , first in 1885 , and again in 1891 . According to a 1903 biography , White was described as an " able , incorruptible and active legislator . " During both sessions , he served as chairman of the Finance Committee and also served in other important capacities , including on the Judiciary Committee . 
 The West Virginia Legislature of 1891 was composed largely of members of the West Virginia Democratic Party , of which White was a member . In 1891 , White 's colleagues in the legislature delivered a testimonial to White in gratitude for his service . It stated : 
 " SIR : – Among the members of the Legislature of West Virginia there is a general desire to express to you in some formal way their appreciation of the great zeal , ability and untiring industry that have marked your course in the Legislature this session . As chairman of the Finance Committee and one of the Judiciary Committee of the House , the duties incumbent upon you have been exceeding [ sic ] important and exacting , both in committee room and on the floor of the House . In the performance of these duties you have been so zealous , industrious , painstaking and conservative as to attract the attention and win the respect and confidence of the entire legislature and to deserve thanks and gratitude not only of your fellow members but of the people of the state at large . Permit us , therefore , to tender to you some expression of our appreciation of the benefit of the State derived from your earnest labors to say that we all feel that you have fully deserved not only our commendation but a right to the gratitude and respect of your fellow citizens throughout the State of West Virginia .

 During breakfast at the camp , Glenn ( Steven Yeun ) , at the urging of Dale ( Jeffrey DeMunn ) , finally tells the group that the Greene family 's barn is full of walkers . The survivors inspect the structure and debate what they should do . Shane ( Jon Bernthal ) furiously demands they clear the barn of the walkers , while Rick ( Andrew Lincoln ) reminds him that they 're guests on Hershel ( Scott Wilson ) ' s property and they cannot leave without Sophia ( Madison Lintz ) . Shane believes Sophia is long gone , prompting Daryl ( Norman Reedus ) to react furiously . Rick agrees the barn needs to be cleared , but insists on getting Hershel 's blessing first . 
 Maggie Greene ( Lauren Cohan ) is upset with Glenn because he betrayed her confidence by telling the group about the barn . Glenn confronts her and says that her personal well @-@ being is more important than her affections . As Daryl readies to search for Sophia , Sophia 's mother , Carol ( Melissa McBride ) insists that he not go out into the woods . He responds angrily , but later apologizes by taking her to a pond where another Cherokee rose is blooming ; this restores her faith in finding her daughter . Rick interrupts Hershel 's lunch to discuss the barn , and Hershel demands that the group leave his farm within a week . Rick argues that going " out there " would be a death sentence for the group . Rick finds Shane brooding by the barn , where Shane defends his opinion about clearing it of zombies . The two argue until Rick finally blurts out that Lori ( Sarah Wayne Callies ) is pregnant . As Rick leaves , Shane congratulates him , albeit with a look of fear and shock on his face . 
 After being confronted by Maggie , Hershel and Jimmy ( James Allen McCune ) bring Rick to a forest swamp , where they find two walkers stuck in the mud . Hershel explains that if Rick 's group wants to stay , they have to treat walkers like people . Meanwhile , Shane confronts Lori about her family 's well @-@ being , adding that he is the father of her baby . Lori denies his sentiments , which causes Shane to storm off the premises .

 " Pretty Much Dead Already " was written by Scott M. Gimple and directed by Michelle MacLaren . It features recurring appearances from Lauren Cohan , Scott Wilson , IronE Singleton , Madison Lintz , Emily Kinney , Jane McNeill , James Allen McCune , and Amber Chaney . Following the initial broadcast of the previous installment , " Secrets " , writer Robert Kirkman teased the following episode " Pretty Much Dead Already " . He stated : " There 's a lot of big stuff out there that we will be wrapping up to a certain extent . In the writers ' room we were fully aware that we were coming up on this hiatus , so we definitely wrote to it . I think people are going to be a little shocked . " 
 The death of Sophia Peletier is a major incident in " Pretty Much Dead Already " , largely affecting the themes of the episode . After the group has shot the walkers housed in Hershel Greene 's barn , Sophia appears from the barn as a walker , much to the groups ' dismay . A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her . Despite being initially surprised about her character 's being killed off , Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show . Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her , and stated that she was " going to look back on and say that was amazing . " Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show , as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression . " When a good idea comes up , you have to go with it , " he articulated . " Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters . Having Carol [ ... ] survive her daughter as opposed to the other way around as it is in the comics is going to lead to interesting but different stories . " Although Kirkman was not on set during production of the sequence , Gimple retrieved shell casings from the blanks that were fired on set . Referred to as " <unk> " by the writers , Kirkman asserted that he emphasized unpredictability while creating the scene . 
 It 's good to know people didn 't see it coming . That 's a big concern when you have this kind of story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal . You don 't want people to be expecting it , especially in the Walking Dead . I pride myself in the fact that , when you pick up an issue of the comic , you don 't know what 's going to happen at any time . So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment , it 's very exciting for me . I ’ m glad people are being caught off guard . 
 Other themes prevalent in the episode include Lori 's pregnancy . After getting into a heated argument , Rick reveals to Shane about her pregnancy . Although he didn 't question who the biological father was , Robert Kirkman felt that Rick was " smart enough to know that the kid 's either his or Shane 's and there may not be any way of ever finding out that definitively . " He continued : " Bringing that up to his wife , who he loves , is only going to be painful for her . I think that ’ s him being a good husband and him showing his tremendous leadership ability in that he can put his self aside for the betterment of someone else . "

 " Pretty Much Dead Already " was critically acclaimed by television critics . Eric Goldman of IGN evaluated the episode as " completely depressing " , and added that the dark nature made the series excel . Goldman ultimately gave the episode an eight out of ten , signifying a " great " rating . Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal felt that the episode was the series ' best installment . Writing for The Grand Rapids Press , John Serba opined that " Pretty Much Dead Already " was a delightful ending to the first portion of the season . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club stated that prior to its ending , the episode was " the usual mix of pretty good and deeply irritating . " Handlen lauded the character development in the installment ; " The episode puts a lot of effort into heightening the tensions between Hershel and Rick 's people , and while it ’ s not exactly subtle , it makes enough sense to be effective . This is conflict that should 've been building for a few episodes now , instead of arriving fully formed right before it explodes , but I 'm willing to take what I can get . " Concluding his review , he issued the episode an A – grade . Digital Spy 's Morgan Jeffrey avouched that " Pretty Much Dead Already " was " excellent " , and added that the tension " slowly ratchets up to an almost unbearable level . " Some critics were divided with the episode . Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that while the writers put a lot of substance into the characters , many of them are still underdeveloped . Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times felt that some parts of the episode lacked cohesion and direction . 
 The episode 's concluding scene involving Sophia 's death was cited as the episode highlight . Janet Turley of The Huffington Post asserted that the sequence was " fiction not afraid to provoke " , while Goldman described it as an " absolutely horrific scenario " . CNN 's Henry Hanks opined that the sequence " left [ them ] with a final scene that we 'll be talking about until then . " New York 's Starlee Kine asserted that it contained cinematic qualities , and felt that the scene was " satisfying , sad , and fun " . She wrote : " It was everything you 've ever wanted this show to be . Zombies plus no dialogue , such a winning combination ! And how great was it that Sophia was dead instead of impossibly alive somewhere , holed up with Merle or Morgan or those warmhearted gang members in Atlanta . And because she was granted more screen time than she ever was when she was alive , we were finally able to care about the loss of her short , young life . " Jen Chaney of The Washington Post echoed synonymous sentiments ; " Really , the final moments of the last episode before the AMC series ' December / January hiatus played like a fireworks finale on the Fourth of July , assuming your Fourth of July celebrations typically involve zombies and a pile of corpses . " Rawlings concluded that it was the perfect resolution for what he called " television 's slowest subplot " . McIntyre felt that the concluding sequence was the most eventful moment of the episode , and stated that it was difficult to watch . 
 Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly affirmed that the scene reestablished The Walking Dead to full form , as well as redeemed the season 's " general <unk> thus far . " HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts , and observed that it was effective enough to keep the viewers chattering until the succeeding episode . Handlen summated : " The Sophia reveal is a punch in the gut , because narrative fiction teaches us the longer someone stays missing , the better the chance they 'll turn up alive ; otherwise , where would the drama be ? By using the little girl in this way , the show transforms what should 've been anti @-@ climax into a reinvention of an entire storyline . It 's not enough to make the bad parts of the earlier episodes great , but it does show that the writers had more on their mind than stalling . " Mark Maurer of The Star @-@ Ledger felt that albeit predictable , the segment was " well executed " . Josh Wigler of MTV said that the storyline ended in " a much darker way than anyone could have imagined . "

Estimates of the number of captives range from 30 @,@ 000 to 80 @,@ 000 but the generally accepted figure is 60 @,@ 000 , as stated by Tipu in the Sultan @-@ ul @-@ Tawarikh . The captivity was the most disconsolate period in the community 's history . Its cause is disputed , although most historians consider it happened for political rather than religious reasons , owing to the alliance between the Mangalorean Catholics and the British during the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War ( 1780 – 1784 ) . 
 The Mangalorean Catholic community in Mangalore flourished during the regime of Tipu 's father , Hyder Ali . Soon after Tipu inherited the territory in January 1784 , he issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara , confiscate their estates , and deport them to Seringapatam . His orders were carried out on 24 February 1784 . Twenty thousand Christians died during the journey from Mangalore to Seringapatam . During captivity they suffered extreme hardships , torture , death , and persecutions with many Christians forcibly converted to Islam . Their captivity led to a near disintegration of the community and ended only when Tipu was killed by the British at the Battle of Seringapatam on 4 May 1799 , during the Fourth Anglo @-@ Mysore War . Of the 60 @,@ 000 – 80 @,@ 000 Christians taken captive , only 15 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 both made it out alive and retained their original faith . The episode had a deep impact on the Literature of Mangalorean Catholics . The bi @-@ centennial anniversary of the Christians ' release from captivity was celebrated across the region on 4 May 1999 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Roman Catholics from the South Canara district on the south @-@ western coast of India , under the jurisdiction of the Mangalore Diocese , are generally known as Mangalorean Catholics . They are Konkani people who speak the Konkani language . All earlier records of South Canara 's Christians were lost at the time of their deportation by Tipu in 1784 and it is not known when Christianity was introduced in South Canara . It is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara as they had in Malabar , a region south of Canara . During the 13th century Italian traveller Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast . Scholars have surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce , and that some Christian priests possibly accompanied them in their evangelical work . In 1321 , the French Dominican friar Jordanus <unk> of <unk> in south @-@ western France , arrived in Bhatkal , North Canara . According to historian Severine Silva , no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century . 
 Propagation of Christianity in the region only began after the arrival of the Portuguese in 1498 , when Vasco da Gama 's landed on St Mary 's Islands in South Canara and planted a cross there on his voyage from Portugal to India . In 1500 , the Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral arrived at Anjediva in North Canara with eight Franciscan missionaries under the leadership of Frei Henrique Soares de Coimbra . On arrival they converted 22 or 23 natives to Christianity in the Mangalore region . In 1526 , during the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio , the Portuguese took possession of Mangalore whereupon Portuguese Franciscans began slowly spreading Christianity in Mangalore . 
 Contemporary Mangalorean Catholics are descended mainly from the Goan Catholic settlers , who migrated to Canara from Goa , a state north of Canara , between 1560 and 1763 in three major waves . The first wave of immigrants came to Mangalore to escape the trials of the Goa Inquisition of 1560 . These migrants were welcomed by the native Bednore rulers of Canara for their agricultural skills . They were followed by a second major wave precipitated by the Portugal – Adil Shahi wars between 1570 and 1579 . A final influx of immigrants arrived during the Portugal – Maratha wars in Goa during the late 17th and early 18th centuries . According to Mangalorean historian Alan Machado Prabhu , the Mangalorean Catholics numbered about 58 @,@ 000 by the time of the capture of Canara by Hyder Ali in 1765 . 
 = = Under the Wodeyar Rajas and Hyder Ali = = 
 According to writer <unk> , by 1686 , Seringapatam , capital of the Kingdom of Mysore , was home to a community of more than 400 Catholics who were severely harassed in the following two decades when their churches were destroyed and the priest 's house confiscated . This destruction was undertaken in the name of the Wodeyar king , Kanthirava Narasaraja I by his finance minister . The priest 's house was eventually returned to the church in 1709 . Sometime between 1700 and 1717 , another church was built in <unk> , a suburb of Seringapatam , in the face of local opposition . Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717 , when an anti @-@ Christian outburst led to the expulsion of the resident priest who was thereafter forbidden to preach . Several more anti @-@ Christian demonstrations followed , but by 1736 relations had once more improved between the two groups . 
 But , it was during the period of Chikka Devaraja ( 1673 – 1704 ) , 400 priests who protested against the taxes that were punished . As per a legend they were strangled by the wrestlers of his court . 
 Hyder Ali , born in 1721 or 1722 at <unk> in the northern part of Mysore State , joined the Mysorean Army and distinguished himself in the 1749 Siege of Devanahalli . He took part in the Carnatic wars of ( 1751 – 1755 ) and gained in @-@ depth experience of warfare . Hyder Ali rapidly rose to power at the Mysore court and soon became prime minister and general of the king . From 1761 onwards , he took de facto control of the throne of the Mysore Kingdom through the Wodeyar dynasty . In 1763 , he occupied Mangalore and Canara , but maintained amicable relations with the Christians . Historian Severine Silva states , " the general relations between Hyder and Christians form a chapter which has been entirely lost . " Hyder was close friends with two Goan Catholic priests , Bishop Noronha , and Fr . Joachim Miranda . <unk> , a Protestant missionary , also lived at the court of Hyder . However , Hyder was also involved in suppressing the Jesuit order . 
 Hyder 's army included several Catholic soldiers and he allowed Christians to build a church within the Seringapatam Fort where French generals offered prayers and priests visited . Mangalorean historian <unk> D 'Souza mentions that Hyder had also used Canara Christians for administrative purposes . In accordance with the two treaties concluded with Portugal , Hyder allowed Portuguese priests to settle disputes among the Christians . Despite this , the Christians in general hated Hyder Ali because of the heavy taxes they were made to pay to the king 's treasury . 
 In February 1768 , the British captured Mangalore and Canara from Hyder . At the end of the same year , Hyder , along with his son Tipu Sultan , defeated the British and recaptured Mangalore . After the conquest , Hyder was informed that the Mangalorean Catholics had helped the British in their conquest of Mangalore . Hyder believed that this behaviour amounted to treachery against the sovereign . Summoning a Portuguese officer and several Christian priests from Mangalore , he asked for suggestions as to how the Mangalorean Catholics should be punished . The Portuguese officer suggested the death penalty for those Catholics who had helped the British , as it was the standard punishment for betraying a sovereign . Rather than follow this advice , Hyder chose a diplomatic stance and imprisoned Christians found guilty of treachery instead of executing them . Later , he opened negotiations with the Portuguese . Agreement was reached and suspicions against the clergy and the Christians were removed and they were no longer chastised . During Hyder 's regime , Roman Catholicism in Mangalore and the Mangalorean Catholic community continued to flourish . 
 Historians claim that Hyder was extremely tolerant towards the Christians . According to historian Severine Silva , he followed the same policy of religious tolerance towards Christians as he had from the beginning , even though the Christians had revolted against him . The Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War began in 1780 and led to Hyder 's death on 7 December 1782 , at Arcot . Afterwards the British recaptured the fort at Mangalore . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Tipu Sultan succeeded his father at the age of 31 . He had also taken part in the conquest of Mangalore in 1768 , and accused the Mangalorean Catholics of treachery towards the sovereign , as well as their having helped the British . He was aware of the treatment of Canara Muslims by the Portuguese clergy , and had always resented his father 's favourable policy towards the Mangalorean Catholics . 
 The British army under Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Brigadier @-@ General Richard Matthews , landed in Canara on 9 March 1783 , and captured the Mangalore fort on the orders of the Bombay Government . Many Christians were allegedly recruited into the army of General Matthews . Tipu became infuriated with the Christians of Canara for two reasons . Firstly , when French soldiers laid down their arms because of the Peace of Paris ( 1783 ) treaty , the Christians refused to fight for Tipu . Secondly , the Christians lent the sum of Rs . 330 @,@ 000 to General Matthews , which led Tipu to believe that the Mangalorean Catholics were helping the British . 
 In May 1783 , General Matthews was accused of procrastination and suspended by the Bombay Government . Thereafter Colonel John Campbell received provisional command of the strategic fort of Mangalore on 5 May 1783 . Tipu made several assaults on the Mangalore fort up until January 1784 , all of which resulted in failure . Looking at the wounded embattled garrison , Colonel Campbell considered it futile to hold out any longer . He finally delivered the Mangalore fort to Tipu when the British capitulated on 30 January 1784 . On 11 March 1784 , Tipu and the British East India Company signed the Treaty of Mangalore , thus bringing an end to the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War . 
 Historian Ahmad Saeed states that the Christians acted as spies and guided the British whilst historian <unk> Fernandes points out that the Christians helped Colonel Campbell in the Mangalore fort and adjoining towns by providing them with rice , vegetables , meat , men , and money . In a letter to his superiors , Colonel Campbell strongly commended the role of the Bombay Natives regiment . This was led by a native major named Francis Pinto who put up a brave defence of the fort . He also refers to these troops as the " Native Christians " . Fernandes further points out that the Christians had entered into a league with Mysore traitors Kasim Ali and Mohammed Ali , who were enemies of Tipu , and had plotted with the English to overthrow him . He also states that the Head of the Congregation of Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet , near Mangalore , provided the British garrison with 1 @,@ 000 bags of rice . 
 Severine Silva points out that the Christians of Canara were eager to get rid of Tipu . The History of the Diocese of Mangalore by J. Moore and Angelus Francis Xavier Maffei also purports to show that the Christians of Canara were charged with assisting the British during the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War . Tipu made a number of accusations against the Christians , including that they had invited the British to invade Canara in 1781 – 82 , furnished supplies to and otherwise assisted General Matthews ' army when it landed and took possession of Onore , accompanied the British detachment to Mangalore , provided it with supplies both before and after the march , aided the British in repairing breaches made when the fort was besieged by Tipu and plundered the state treasury at <unk> when that fortress fell to General Matthews . 
 After receiving highly exaggerated reports about the role of the Christians and their help to the British during the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War , Tipu decided to minimise the threat to his kingdom from the British and banish the Christians of Canara . According to Severine Silva , this decision was the logical outcome of the plans he had nurtured since the time of the conquest of Mangalore with his father Hyder in 1768 . 
 It is generally believed that the propaganda of the Goan priests and the alliance of the Christians with the English cause Tipu to banish the community from Canara . The main political reason for this decision was Tipu 's belief that if he banished the Christians , he could keep the British at bay . However , Alan Machado Prabhu dismisses the idea of large @-@ scale Christian support for the British during the Second Mangalore War as a myth which is not based on any concrete evidence . 
 Prabhu states that the charge that the Christians constituted a united front cannot be sustained . Apart from divergent viewpoints among the Christian community at the time , he argues that difficulties in communication for a minority Christian population spread over a 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) forested coastline broken by numerous streams and rivers , would have made united action practically impossible . He further states that the majority of Mangalorean Catholics were agriculturists farming land capable of growing three crops a year . The idea of neglecting their fields in the cause of a small band of British isolated in the confines of a fort besieged by a large Mysorean army would have sounded insane . Even if the British had made promises , they would have had little effect on the militarily inexperienced Christians , who would then have had to fight a large and well @-@ trained army in support of a beleaguered army which was not even successful . 
 On the basis of Colonel Campbell 's letter , Prabhu concludes that the " Native Christian " soldiers present in the fort were probably all East Indian infantry and artillery experts , belonging to the Bombay Natives . He believes that at best , any assistance was of a limited nature and restricted to purely individual enterprise . Prabhu points out that European troops , both English and French , including those from Tipu 's own mercenaries , did receive some assistance although this was more humanitarian than military . He also states that claim of the Christians paying the British Rs . 330 @,@ 000 is an utter fabrication . To make his point , Prabhu points out that the annual revenue of the Portuguese province of Goa itself amounted to over three to four lakh rupees . Payment of the huge sum claimed by Tipu would have required a large number of wealthy donors — which the Mangalorean Catholics were not . 
 = = Execution of orders = = 
 Soon after Tipu gained possession of Mangalore in January 1784 , he issued orders for the seizure of the Christians in Canara , confiscation of their estates , and their subsequent deportation to his capital at Seringapatam along the Jamalabad fort route . Tipu expelled the 13 Goan priests from his kingdom . They were issued with orders of expulsion to Goa , fined Rs . 200 @,@ 000 , and threatened with death by hanging if they ever returned . He also banished Fr . Joachim Miranda , a close friend of his father Hyder Ali . In a letter to the Portuguese Government , Tipu wrote that he had commuted the priests ' sentences of capital punishment and ordered a fine of 30 million rupees instead . According to a report of 1784 , Tipu had driven 26 missionaries out of his state , three of whom secretly went to join the captives . Two died en route and one was killed by a soldier . The missionaries were warned that they faced the death penalty if they re @-@ entered Tipu 's kingdom . 
 On 24 February 1784 , ( Ash Wednesday ) , in a secret and well planned move , Tipu arrested a large number of Christians across the province of Canara and other parts of his kingdom . Accounts of the number of captives range from 30 @,@ 000 to 80 @,@ 000 . According to historian Kranti Farias , all arrests may not have been made on a single day , but instead carried out in stages . 
 When Tipu issued his orders to seize the Christians , the British , who had entered into a treaty with him on 11 March 1784 , were helpless . Captives also included Malayali Christians , and Tamil Christians from the Tamil @-@ countries . The Portuguese , guardians of the Christian faith in Canara , intervened and requested Tipu not to imprison the priests . They suggested that he let the Christians live peacefully as his father Hyder Ali had done . But Tipu paid no heed to their request . Estimates suggest that about 7 @,@ 000 people remained in hiding . Many were actively assisted by the Hindus whilst the few Christians in Canara who escaped Tipu 's initial captivity fled to Coorg and Malabar , where they were protected by the native rulers . 
 = = Confiscation of property and destruction of churches = = 
 On Tipu 's orders , all estates and properties of the Christians were seized , and distributed among his soldiers . Churches and historical records were also destroyed . The seizures were so sudden that the Christians had no time to prepare for their departure or to dispose of what little property they possessed . The value of property confiscated is estimated by Fr . Angelus Francis Xavier Maffei , an Italian Jesuit , at Rs . 500 @,@ 000 . 
 Tipu then ordered the destruction of all 27 churches in Canara . According to oral tradition , the <unk> mosque in Mangalore was constructed with stones from the destroyed Milagres Church . Other Christian establishments that were spared were converted to storehouses , offices , or homes for wealthy Muslims . A popular fortification in Mangalore , the Sultan Battery , built in 1784 by Tipu Sultan to prevent English warships from entering the Gurupura river , was constructed with stones taken from destroyed churches . The bells from the demolished churches eventually found their way into a number of temples in the area . After being informed of the impending roundup by a friend in Tipu 's government , Fr . Joachim Miranda disbanded St. Joseph 's Seminary and sent the seminarians to Verapoly , from where some proceeded to Goa while some joined the Augustinian order . 
 A few buildings escaped destruction , including a small chapel at <unk> near Hassan , built in 1768 and said to have been saved by Tipu 's Muslim officers on the pretext that it was used to store cotton . Tipu also spared the Monte Mariano church at Farangipet , on account of his father 's friendship with Fr . Joachim Miranda . 
 Tipu is said to have given orders to preserve the church at <unk> , near Ancola , in gratitude for a cure by a Christian woman while at Ancola . The Igreja da Santa Cruz ( Portuguese : Church of Holy Cross ) at Hospet was saved through the intercession of the local Jain chiefs . In Seringapatam , a whole battalion of Catholics under an officer named Michael <unk> , upon hearing of Tipu 's order to destroy the Seringapatam church , called their fellow soldiers to arms . <unk> , a veteran of Hyder 's army , is credited with telling the assembled Christians , " I shall remain a Christian in spite of all the orders of Tipu Sultan . " The church at <unk> was spared , although the battalion gradually dispersed . 
 = = Journey from Mangalore to Seringapatam = = 
 According to the Barcoor Manuscript , written in Kannada by a Mangalorean Catholic from Barcoor on his return from Seringapatam , the Christians were interned in holding camps at Mangalore , <unk> , Cundapore , Onore , Ancola , and <unk> , with the more rebellious Christians brought in in chains . They were then forced to climb nearly 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) through the dense jungles and gorges of the Western Ghat mountain ranges along two routes , one of which was along the Bantval @-@ Belthangadi @-@ Kulshekar @-@ <unk> @-@ Coorg @-@ Mysore route , and the other along the Gersoppa falls ( Shimoga ) route . On the 200 miles ( 320 km ) journey from Mangalore to Seringapatam the Christians were accompanied by three priests , who had secretly joined them despite threats of expulsion by Tipu . 
 Trouble arose when guards began molesting captive Christian women at their first camp at Bantwal , although able @-@ bodied captives were able to resist the guards . At the next camp at Jamalabad fort , the rebel Christian leaders were thrown down from the fort . The town of " <unk> " or " <unk> " in Tulu , on the cross roads from <unk> to <unk> , derives its name from the large pool of blood which resulted from the execution of rebellious Mangalorean Catholics on their march to Mysore . 
 According to a captive from Barcoor , pregnant women often gave birth en route , and their babies had to be borne bundled about them . When they rested , the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees . If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot . Captives were not given any rations , and when the time came to move on , those who had not finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots . The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20 @,@ 000 captives ( one @-@ third of the total ) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger , disease , and ill treatment by soldiers . The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks . By 1787 , some 30 @,@ 000 captives , half the original number , had perished . 
 = = Fifteen @-@ year captivity = = 
 On arrival at Seringapatam the Christian captives were forced to embrace Islam . All those who complied were freed . Those who refused were tied to the feet of the elephants to be dragged and trampled on Tipu 's orders . 
 One English prisoner related that two risalas ( regiments of soldiers ) arrived daily in Seringapatam to select girls they could take as prizes to join their harems . Often when girls were seized , their young men would offer resistance and smash their <unk> ( palanquin ) . Officers would capture the attackers and administer five hundred strokes with whips and canes , from whose effects many men died . Historian Lewin Bentham Bowring reports that , " Tipu demanded the surrender of the daughters of some of these Christians in order to have them placed in his seraglio , and that , on the refusal of their parents , the latter had their noses , ears and upper lips cut off , and were paraded through the streets on asses , with their faces towards the tails of the animals . " 
 Such treatment of the Christians for refusals by the girls is also confirmed in the accounts of British officer James Scurry , who was held captive along with the Mangalorean Catholics . In his book The Captivity , Sufferings , and Escape of James Scurry , who was Detained a Prisoner During Ten Years , in the Dominions of Hyder Ali and Tippoo Saib ( 1824 ) , Scurry also reports that Tipu relented on his demand for captive girls , after one captive fell from her beast and expired on the spot through loss of blood . About 200 young women , the prettiest and fairest , were selected for Tipu 's seraglio . The rest of the women were distributed as wives to Muslim officers and favourites living there . The future Christian progeny of these young girls and women were lost , and their descendants are fully Islamic as of today . 
 As the food in the camp was sub @-@ standard , Balthazar of Belthangadi , a Mangalorean Catholic nobleman , offered to make a chutney for the captured Mangalorean Catholics . This came to be known as the legendary " Balthazar Chutney " . The <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> meted out more an ignominious punishment to those who refused to accept Islam , slitting off their ears and noses . They were seated on asses , paraded through the city , and thrown into the dungeons of Seringapatam . Able @-@ bodied young Christian men were drafted into the army after being circumcised and converted to Islam . 
 The Barcoor Manuscript records , " On four occasions the young able @-@ bodied Christian men were thus drafted for the Army . Some of them were appointed <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . The Sircar supplied them with ghee , butter , curds , firewood , etc . One hundred men were formed into one company , four companies into a <unk> , four risalas into a <unk> , and four <unk> were placed under a <unk> . Out of every company twenty @-@ five men were taken and circumcised at the end of every month . When the wounds were healed , another twenty @-@ five were taken and circumcised , and so on , until the whole company was initiated into Islamism . " 
 British general Kirkpatrick arrives at a figure of 15 @,@ 000 young men capable of bearing arms , formed into 30 risalas . They were drafted into the <unk> Corps in 1785 and went on to serve in Tipu 's campaigns against the Marathas , the Nizam , and the British during 1786 and 1787 . Casualties were heavy and only a few survived captivity . 
 Those who remained , such as the lame , the blind and the aged , employed themselves in cultivating the land and doing other manual work . Many were made to carry baskets filled with <unk> ( <unk> ) for three days as a public warning to others . The stubborn Christians were given the most menial tasks , and made to work in the paddy fields . They were underfed , and immediately imprisoned for fighting . Completely isolated from any women , the idea was for the captive men to die of old age without creating any progeny . 
 Tipu appointed some Christian captives to posts in his household . He made <unk> ( Salvadore ) Pinto Deputy Vizier and Anthony <unk> ( clockmaker ) Saldanha House Chamberlain . One of his most faithful servants , a Mangalorean Catholic named Manuel Mendes , saved Tipu 's life in Travancore when he donned his master 's robes and sat in his palanquin . Tipu escaped in the general panic whilst Mendes was captured and killed by the Nairs , who mistook him for Tipu . 
 In 1783 , the Kodava Hindus erupted in revolt against Tipu and threw their forces out of Coorg ( Kodagu ) . In 1785 , he marched into Madikeri ( Mercara ) the capital of Kodagu and addressed them . He showed racial and religious bias by stating that the <unk> ( Kodavas ) were guilty of polyandry in a speech before a gathering of Kodavas . He mistook the patrilineal patriarchal Kodavas to be a sub @-@ group of matriarchal Nairs . He threatened that he would not revile or molest a single individual among them , but instead make Ahmadis ( Muslims ) out of the whole of them ; transplanting them from their homeland in the Coorg to Seringapatam . This inflammatory speech with false accusations of polyandry and with an open threat angered the Kodavas who thereafter hated Tipu and again revolted against him . Tipu seized nearly 70 @,@ 000 Hindus of Coorg and held them captive at Seringapatam . They were also forcibly converted to Islam and received the same harsh treatment as the Mangalorean Catholics . From 1786 until 1789 , even the Nair Hindus of Malabar were captured and deported to Seringapatam . 
 By 1787 , half of the Christians had perished through disease and starvation . Tipu attempted to preach to the remaining Christians in Canara , and took them into custody . As the Christians settled down in Seringapatam , they slowly reorganised themselves with the elders forming a secret group named the " Council of Ten " , to help keep their faith alive . According to Balthazar of Belthangadi , in the " Council of Ten " , the Christians met from time to time to deliberate on issues concerning the community . In 1789 , Tipu came to know of the group through one of his officers and thereafter banned any political gathering of the Christians . 
 The Christians , believing that this tribulation came upon them for their neglect of the Law of God and their religious duties , began to fervently read the Krista Purana , an epic poem on the life of Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens ( 1549 –  1619 ) . On discovering this , some Muslims destroyed the books , but the Christians constructed subterranean refuges in which to perform their religious devotions , read the books , and strengthen their faith . According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim , a survivor of the captivity , if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found , the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears , nose , feet and one hand . 
 Reports by Joachim Miranda and the Portuguese Government confirm that the Christians were forcibly circumcised and converted to Islam . These Christians then openly practised Islam . Some writers hold the view that the Christians did not voluntary submit to these conversions . Other Christian missionaries also appealed to the Roman Catholic Church to intervene on behalf of the captive Christians . A priest also wrote a letter to the Holy See to put pressure on Tipu to allow the priests . 
 When Tipu 's embassy visited the court of the French King Louis XVI in 1788 , Pope Clement XIV 's representative conveyed the appeal to the embassy . In the Third Anglo @-@ Mysore War ( 1789 –  92 ) , the British and their allies defeated Tipu . Desperate to break the alliance of powers surrounding him on all sides , Tipu sought to make peace with Portugal , the Marathas , and other powers . According to Severine Silva , he consequently gave up the persecution of Christians , opened negotiations with the Portuguese Government and with the Archbishop of Goa , with a promise that he would stop molesting the Christians , further asserting that he would rebuild all destroyed churches at his own cost . The Christians found their supervision relaxed and Tipu became more conciliatory in his attitude . The Christians now escaped from the camps of Seringapatam and gradually began to enter the neighbouring kingdoms of Coorg and Malabar . 
 At this time many Christians performed daring feats to rescue captives from <unk> and take them to places of safety . A captive named Domingo Pinto ( brother of Salvador Pinto , who rose to high rank in the services of Tipu ) , was particularly proficient in this . He rescued many people and took them secretly to Mangalore or Tellicherry . He proposed that those anxious to regain their liberty could be rescued on payment to him of a certain sum of money . He fixed the rescue price per captive at 8 <unk> ( Rs . 32 ) for a male , and 4 <unk> ( Rs . 16 ) for a female . 
 In 1792 , the King of Coorg , Dodda Vira @-@ Rajendra , managed to escape from captivity at <unk> , and , with the aid of the British armies under Lord Cornwallis , was able to regain Coorg for himself through the treaty of 1792 between the English , their allies and Tipu . Anxious to repopulate a kingdom depopulated by Tipu , Dodda welcomed the fugitive Konkani Christians . As an inducement to remain permanently in his territory , he granted them several privileges , obtained a priest from Goa , and built a chapel for them . After the relaxation of policies from 1792 onwards , the Christians began to resettle in Canara . Many Mangalorean Catholic students , who had studied for the priesthood in Goa returned to Mangalore . 
 After considering the changed circumstances , the Archbishop of Goa , by a provision issued on 20 February 1795 , appointed <unk> José Louis Mendes interim vicar of the four sub @-@ districts of Mangalore , Barcoor , Onore and Moolki . Some other priests also came to Canara with the new vicar . Those from Goa retained their old prejudices and could not accept the rule of Tipu , openly advocating rebellion against him , writing offensive letters and making offensive speeches . As a result , in 1797 , the brief <unk> enjoyed by the Christians ceased and their persecution recommenced .

 In the Battle of Seringapatam on 4 May 1799 , the British army under officers George Harris , David Baird , and Arthur Wellesley stormed the fortress , breached the town of Seringapatam , and killed Tipu .
