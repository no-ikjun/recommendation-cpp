 = = = = Debate over race = = = = 
 Christine Chism distinguishes racist or racialist elements in Tolkien 's views and works as falling into three categories : intentional racism , unconscious Eurocentric bias , and an evolution from latent racism in Tolkien 's early work to a conscious rejection of racist tendencies in his late work . 
 Tolkien once wrote of racial segregation in South Africa , " The treatment of colour nearly always horrifies anyone going out from Britain . " 
 = = = = Opposition to National Socialism = = = = 
 Tolkien vocally opposed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party prior to the Second World War , and was known to especially despise Nazi racist and anti @-@ Semitic ideology . In 1938 , the publishing house Rütten & Loening Verlag was preparing to release The Hobbit in Nazi Germany . To Tolkien 's outrage , he was asked beforehand whether he was of Aryan origin . In a letter to his British publisher Stanley Unwin , he condemned Nazi " race @-@ doctrine " as " wholly pernicious and unscientific " . He added that he had many Jewish friends and was considering " letting a German translation go hang " . He provided two letters to Rütten & Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred . The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany . In the unsent letter , Tolkien makes the point that " Aryan " is a linguistic term , denoting speakers of Indo @-@ Iranian languages . He continued , 
 But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin , I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people . My great @-@ great @-@ grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany : the main part of my descent is therefore purely English , and I am an English subject — which should be sufficient . I have been accustomed , nonetheless , to regard my German name with pride , and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war , in which I served in the English army . I cannot , however , forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature , then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride . 
 In a 1941 letter to his son Michael , he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in " Nordicism " : 
 You have to understand the good in things , to detect the real evil . But no one ever calls on me to ' broadcast ' or do a postscript . Yet I suppose I know better than most what is the truth about this ' Nordic ' nonsense . Anyway , I have in this war a burning private grudge ... against that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... <unk> , perverting , <unk> , and making for ever accursed , that noble northern spirit , a supreme contribution to Europe , which I have ever loved , and tried to present in its true light . Nowhere , incidentally , was it nobler than in England , nor more early sanctified and Christianized . 
 In 1968 , he objected to a description of Middle @-@ earth as " Nordic " , a term he said he disliked because of its association with racialist theories . 
 = = = = Total war = = = = 
 Tolkien criticized Allied use of total war tactics against civilians from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan . In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher , he wrote : 
 We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal , but not to gloat , or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc @-@ crowd <unk> . The destruction of Germany , be it 100 times merited , is one of the most appalling world @-@ catastrophes . Well , well , — you and I can do nothing about it . And that [ should ] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government . Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter — leaving , alas , everyone the poorer , many bereaved or maimed and millions dead , and only one thing triumphant : the Machines . 
 He also reacted with anger at the excesses of anti @-@ German propaganda during the war . In 1944 , he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher : 
 ... it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime , shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation ( when , too , the military needs of his side clearly benefit ) is a drunkard , and a besotted fanatic . ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory : because , if you please , they are rattlesnakes , and don 't know the difference between good and evil ! ( What of the writer ? ) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews <unk> vermin , subhuman , as we have to select the Germans : in other words , no right , whatever they have done . 
 He was horrified by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , referring to the scientists of the Manhattan Project as " these lunatic physicists " and " Babel @-@ builders " . 
 = = = Nature = = = 
 During most his own life conservationism wasn 't yet on the political agenda , and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views – except in some private letters , where he tell about his fondness of forests and sadness of tree @-@ felling . In later years , a number of authors of biographies or literary analysis of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of Lord of the Rings , Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature , and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world . 
 = = Writing = = 
 Tolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his legendarium , beginning with The Book of Lost Tales , written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during The Battle of the Somme . The two most prominent stories , the tale of Beren and Lúthien and that of Túrin , were carried forward into long narrative poems ( published in The Lays of Beleriand ) . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 = = = = British adventure stories = = = = 
 One of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris . Tolkien wished to imitate Morris 's prose and poetry romances , from which he took hints for the names of features such as the Dead Marshes in The Lord of the Rings and Mirkwood , along with some general aspects of approach . 
 Edward Wyke @-@ Smith 's The Marvellous Land of <unk> , with its " table @-@ high " title characters , strongly influenced the incidents , themes , and depiction of Bilbo 's race in The Hobbit . 
 Tolkien also cited H. Rider Haggard 's novel She in a telephone interview : " I suppose as a boy She interested me as much as anything — like the Greek shard of Amyntas [ Amenartas ] , which was the kind of machine by which everything got moving . " A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard 's first edition , and the ancient inscription it bore , once translated , led the English characters to She 's ancient kingdom . Critics have compared this device to the Testament of Isildur in The Lord of the Rings and to Tolkien 's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the Book of <unk> . Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard 's romances and Tolkien 's . 
 Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by S. R. Crockett 's historical novel The Black Douglas and of basing the Necromancer ( Sauron ) on its villain , Gilles de Retz . Incidents in both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are similar in narrative and style to the novel , and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as an influence on Tolkien . 
 = = = = European mythology = = = = 
 Tolkien was inspired by early Germanic , especially Old English , literature , poetry , and mythology , which were his chosen and much @-@ loved areas of expertise . These sources of inspiration included Old English literature such as Beowulf , Norse sagas such as the Volsunga saga and the Hervarar saga , the Poetic Edda , the Prose Edda , the Nibelungenlied , and numerous other culturally related works . Despite the similarities of his work to the Volsunga saga and the Nibelungenlied , which were the basis for Richard Wagner 's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen , Tolkien dismissed critics ' direct comparisons to Wagner , telling his publisher , " Both rings were round , and there the resemblance ceases . " However , some critics believe that Tolkien was , in fact , indebted to Wagner for elements such as the " concept of the Ring as giving the owner mastery of the world ... " Two of the characteristics possessed by the One Ring , its inherent malevolence and corrupting power upon minds and wills , were not present in the mythical sources but have a central role in Wagner 's opera . 
 Tolkien also acknowledged several non @-@ Germanic influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas . Sophocles ' play Oedipus the King he cited as inspiring elements of The Silmarillion and The Children of Húrin . In addition , Tolkien first read William Forsell Kirby 's translation of the Finnish national epic , the Kalevala , while attending King Edward 's School . He described its character of Väinämöinen as one of his influences for Gandalf the Grey . The Kalevala 's antihero Kullervo was further described as an inspiration for Túrin Turambar . <unk> Fimi , Douglas A. Anderson , John Garth , and many other prominent Tolkien scholars believe that Tolkien also drew influence from a variety of Celtic ( Irish , Scottish and Welsh ) history and legends . However , after the Silmarillion manuscript was rejected , in part for its " eye @-@ splitting " Celtic names , Tolkien denied their Celtic origin : 
 Needless to say they are not Celtic ! Neither are the tales . I do know Celtic things ( many in their original languages Irish and Welsh ) , and feel for them a certain distaste : largely for their fundamental unreason . They have bright colour , but are like a broken stained glass window reassembled without design . They are in fact ' mad ' as your reader says — but I don 't believe I am . 
 = = = = Catholicism = = = = 
 Catholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien 's creative imagination , suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit . Tolkien acknowledged this himself : 
 The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work ; unconsciously so at first , but consciously in the revision . That is why I have not put in , or have cut out , practically all references to anything like ' religion ' , to cults or practices , in the imaginary world . For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism . 
 Specifically , Paul H. Kocher argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the absence of good . He cites many examples in The Lord of the Rings , such as Sauron 's " <unk> Eye " : " the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit , a window into nothing " . Kocher sees Tolkien 's source as Thomas Aquinas , " whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien , as a medievalist and a Catholic , knows well " . Tom Shippey makes the same point , but , instead of referring to Aquinas , says Tolkien was very familiar with Alfred the Great 's Anglo @-@ Saxon translation of Boethius ' Consolation of Philosophy , known as the Lays of Boethius . Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius : " evil is nothing " . He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of Frodo 's remark , " the Shadow ... can only mock , it cannot make : not real new things of its own " , and related remarks by Treebeard and Elrond . He goes on to argue that in The Lord of the Rings evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force , more than merely the absence of good ( though not independent to the point of the Manichaean heresy ) , and suggests that Alfred 's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view . 
 Another interesting argument is Stratford Caldecott 's theological view on the Ring and what it represents . " The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will , the assertion of self in disobedience to God . It appears to give freedom , but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel . It corrodes the human will of the wearer , rendering him increasingly " thin " and unreal ; indeed , its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity . You could say the Ring is sin itself : tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with , increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run " .

 = = = = Beowulf : The Monsters and the Critics = = = = 
 As well as his fiction , Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism . His seminal 1936 lecture , later published as an article , revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo @-@ Saxon epic Beowulf by literary critics . The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day . Beowulf is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien 's later fiction , with major details of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the poem . The piece reveals many of the aspects of Beowulf which Tolkien found most inspiring , most prominently the role of monsters in literature , particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem : 
 As for the poem , one dragon , however hot , does not make a summer , or a host ; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness . And dragons , real dragons , essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale , are actually rare . 
 = = = = Children 's books and other short works = = = = 
 In addition to his <unk> compositions , Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children . He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them , building up a series of short stories ( later compiled and published as The Father Christmas Letters ) . Other stories included Mr. Bliss and <unk> ( for children ) , and Leaf by <unk> ( part of Tree and Leaf ) , The Adventures of Tom Bombadil , On Fairy @-@ Stories , Smith of Wootton Major and Farmer Giles of Ham . <unk> and Smith of Wootton Major , like The Hobbit , borrowed ideas from his legendarium . 
 = = = = The Hobbit = = = = 
 Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular , but by sheer accident a book called The Hobbit , which he had written some years before for his own children , came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall , an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin , who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication . However , when it was published a year later , the book attracted adult readers as well as children , and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel . 
 = = = = The Lord of the Rings = = = = 
 The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work : the epic novel The Lord of the Rings ( originally published in three volumes 1954 – 1955 ) . Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings , during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings , in particular his closest friend C. S. Lewis , the author of The Chronicles of Narnia . Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the background of The Silmarillion , but in a time long after it . 
 Tolkien at first intended The Lord of the Rings to be a children 's tale in the style of The Hobbit , but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing . Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit , it addressed an older audience , drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years , and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes . Tolkien 's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of The Lord of the Rings . 
 The Lord of the Rings became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since , ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century , judged by both sales and reader surveys . In the 2003 " Big Read " survey conducted by the BBC , The Lord of the Rings was found to be the UK 's " Best @-@ loved Novel " . Australians voted The Lord of the Rings " My Favourite Book " in a 2004 survey conducted by the Australian ABC . In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers , The Lord of the Rings was judged to be their favourite " book of the millennium " . In 2002 Tolkien was voted the 92nd " greatest Briton " in a poll conducted by the BBC , and in 2004 he was voted 35th in the <unk> 's Great South Africans , the only person to appear in both lists . His popularity is not limited to the English @-@ speaking world : in a 2004 poll inspired by the UK 's " Big Read " survey , about 250 @,@ 000 Germans found The Lord of the Rings to be their favourite work of literature . 
 = = = Posthumous publications = = = 
 = = = = The Silmarillion = = = = 
 Tolkien wrote a brief " Sketch of the Mythology " , which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin ; and that sketch eventually evolved into the Quenta Silmarillion , an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published . Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with The Lord of the Rings , but publishers ( both Allen & Unwin and Collins ) declined . Moreover , printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain , requiring The Lord of the Rings to be published in three volumes . The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series The History of Middle @-@ earth , edited by Tolkien 's son , Christopher Tolkien . From around 1936 , Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of The Fall of Númenor , which was inspired by the legend of Atlantis . 
 Tolkien had appointed his son Christopher to be his literary executor , and he ( with assistance from Guy Gavriel Kay , later a well @-@ known fantasy author in his own right ) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume , published as The Silmarillion in 1977 . It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978 . 
 = = = = Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle @-@ earth = = = = 
 In 1980 Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material , under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle @-@ earth . In subsequent years ( 1983 – 1996 ) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials , together with notes and extensive commentary , in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle @-@ earth . They contain unfinished , abandoned , alternative , and outright contradictory accounts , since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories . There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit , the two most closely related works , because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other . He commented in 1965 , while editing The Hobbit for a third edition , that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose . 
 = = = = Mr. Bliss = = = = 
 One of Tolkien 's least @-@ known short works is the children 's storybook Mr. Bliss , published in 1982 . It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor @-@ car . Many adventures follow : encounters with bears , angry neighbours , irate shopkeepers , and assorted collisions . The story was inspired by Tolkien 's own vehicular mishaps with his first car , purchased in 1932 . The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien 's sons . Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book . He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of The Hobbit . The lavish ink and coloured @-@ pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive . Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style , but then found he did not have time to do so . The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien 's difficult @-@ to @-@ read illustrated manuscript , with a typeset transcription on each facing page . 
 = = = = The Children of Húrin = = = = 
 More recently , in 2007 , The Children of Húrin was published by HarperCollins ( in the UK and Canada ) and Houghton Mifflin ( in the US ) . The novel tells the story of Túrin Turambar and his sister <unk> , children of Húrin <unk> . The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from The Silmarillion , Unfinished Tales , The History of Middle @-@ earth , and unpublished manuscripts . 
 = = = = The Legend of Sigurd and <unk> = = = = 
 The Legend of Sigurd and <unk> , which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , retells the legend of Sigurd and the fall of the <unk> from Germanic mythology . It is a narrative poem composed in alliterative verse and is modelled after the Old Norse poetry of the Elder Edda . Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father 's work . 
 According to Christopher Tolkien , it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work 's composition . On the basis of circumstantial evidence , he suggests that it dates from the 1930s . In his foreword he wrote , " He scarcely ever ( to my knowledge ) referred to them . For my part , I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life , when he spoke of them to me , and tried unsuccessfully to find them . " In a 1967 letter to W. H. Auden , Tolkien wrote , 
 Thank you for your wonderful effort in translating and reorganizing The Song of the Sibyl . In return again I hope to send you , if I can lay my hands on it ( I hope it isn 't lost ) , a thing I did many years ago when trying to learn the art of writing alliterative poetry : an attempt to unify the lays about the <unk> from the Elder Edda , written in the old eight @-@ line fornyrðislag stanza . 
 = = = = The Fall of Arthur = = = = 
 The Fall of Arthur , published on 23 May 2013 , is a long narrative poem composed by Tolkien in the early @-@ 1930s . It is alliterative , extending to almost 1 @,@ 000 lines imitating the Old English Beowulf metre in Modern English . Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction , the historical setting of the poem is during the Post @-@ Roman Migration Period , both in form ( using Germanic verse ) and in content , showing Arthur as a British warlord fighting the Saxon invasion , while it avoids the high medieval aspects Arthurian cycle ( such as the Grail , and the courtly setting ) ; the poem begins with a British " counter @-@ invasion " to the Saxon lands ( Arthur eastward in arms purposed ) . 
 = = = = Beowulf : A Translation and Commentary = = = = 
 Beowulf : A Translation and Commentary , published on 22 May 2014 , is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem Beowulf from Old English to modern English . Translated by Tolkien from 1920 to 1926 , it was edited by his son Christopher . The translation is followed by over 200 pages of commentary on the poem ; this commentary was the basis of Tolkien 's acclaimed 1936 lecture " Beowulf : The Monsters and the Critics " . The book also includes the previously unpublished " <unk> Spell " and two versions of " The Lay of Beowulf " . The former is a fantasy piece on Beowulf 's biographical background , while the latter is a poem on the Beowulf theme .

 The Story of Kullervo , first published in Tolkien Studies in 2010 and reissued with additional material in 2015 , is a retelling of a 19th @-@ century Finnish poem . It was written in 1915 while Tolkien was studying at Oxford .

 Before his death Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts , drafts , proofs and other materials related to his then @-@ published works – including The Lord of the Rings , The Hobbit and Farmer Giles of Ham – to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Marquette University 's John P. Raynor , S.J. , Library in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . After his death his estate donated the papers containing Tolkien 's Silmarillion mythology and his academic work to Oxford University 's Bodleian Library . 
 In 2009 , a partial draft of Language and Human Nature , which Tolkien had begun co @-@ writing with C. S. Lewis but had never completed , was discovered at the Bodleian Library . 
 = = Languages and philology = = 
 = = = Linguistic career = = = 
 Both Tolkien 's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology . He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with Old Norse as special subject . He worked for the Oxford English Dictionary from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W , including walrus , over which he struggled mightily . In 1920 , he became Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds , where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty . He gave courses in Old English heroic verse , history of English , various Old English and Middle English texts , Old and Middle English philology , introductory Germanic philology , Gothic , Old Icelandic , and Medieval Welsh . When in 1925 , aged thirty @-@ three , Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo @-@ Saxon at Pembroke College , Oxford , he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a " Viking Club " . He also had a certain , if imperfect , knowledge of Finnish . 
 Privately , Tolkien was attracted to " things of racial and linguistic significance " , and in his 1955 lecture English and Welsh , which is crucial to his understanding of race and language , he entertained notions of " inherent linguistic predilections " , which he termed the " native language " as opposed to the " cradle @-@ tongue " which a person first learns to speak . He considered the West Midlands dialect of Middle English to be his own " native language " , and , as he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955 , " I am a West @-@ <unk> by blood ( and took to early west @-@ midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it ) . " 
 = = = Language construction = = = 
 Parallel to Tolkien 's professional work as a philologist , and sometimes overshadowing this work , to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin , was his affection for constructing languages . The most developed of these are Quenya and Sindarin , the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien 's legendarium . Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of aesthetics and euphony , and Quenya in particular was designed from " <unk> " considerations ; it was intended as an " <unk> " , and was phonologically based on Latin , with ingredients from Finnish , Welsh , English , and Greek . A notable addition came in late 1945 with <unk> or <unk> , a language of a " faintly Semitic flavour " , connected with Tolkien 's Atlantis legend , which by The Notion Club Papers ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited , and via the " Second Age " and the story of Eärendil was grounded in the legendarium , thereby providing a link of Tolkien 's 20th @-@ century " real primary world " with the legendary past of his Middle @-@ earth . 
 Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them , and he consequently took a dim view of auxiliary languages : in 1930 a congress of <unk> were told as much by him , in his lecture A Secret Vice , " Your language construction will breed a mythology " , but by 1956 he had concluded that " <unk> , Esperanto , Ido , <unk> , & c , & c , are dead , far <unk> than ancient unused languages , because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends " . 
 The popularity of Tolkien 's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular , and even on mainstream dictionaries , which today commonly accept Tolkien 's idiosyncratic spellings dwarves and dwarvish ( alongside dwarfs and dwarfish ) , which had been little used since the mid @-@ 19th century and earlier . ( In fact , according to Tolkien , had the Old English plural survived , it would have been <unk> or <unk> . ) He also coined the term <unk> , though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 = = = Adaptations = = = 
 In a 1951 letter to Milton Waldman , Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a " body of more or less connected legend " , of which " [ t ] he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole , and yet leave scope for other minds and hands , wielding paint and music and drama " . The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien 's legends . Personally known to him were Pauline Baynes ( Tolkien 's favourite illustrator of The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Farmer Giles of Ham ) and Donald Swann ( who set the music to The Road Goes Ever On ) . Queen Margrethe II of Denmark created illustrations to The Lord of the Rings in the early 1970s . She sent them to Tolkien , who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings . 
 However , Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime , and was sometimes harshly disapproving . In 1946 , he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of The Hobbit as " too <unk> ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose , and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the Odinic wanderer that I think of " . 
 Tolkien was sceptical of the emerging Tolkien fandom in the United States , and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of The Lord of the Rings : 
 Thank you for sending me the projected ' blurbs ' , which I return . The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction ; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it . 
 He had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay " On Fairy @-@ Stories " , first presented in 1939 : 
 In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words , to true literature . ... Drama is naturally hostile to Fantasy . Fantasy , even of the simplest kind , hardly ever succeeds in Drama , when that is presented as it should be , visibly and audibly acted . 
 = = = = Film adaptations = = = = 
 Tolkien scholar James Dunning coined the word Tollywood , a portmanteau derived from " Tolkien Hollywood " , to describe attempts to create a cinematographic adaptation of the stories in Tolkien 's legendarium aimed at generating good box office results , rather than at fidelity to the idea of the original . 
 On receiving a screenplay for a proposed film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings by Morton Grady Zimmerman , Tolkien wrote : 
 I would ask them to make an effort of imagination sufficient to understand the irritation ( and on occasion the resentment ) of an author , who finds , increasingly as he proceeds , his work treated as it would seem carelessly in general , in places recklessly , and with no evident signs of any appreciation of what it is all about . 
 Tolkien went on to criticize the script scene by scene ( " yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless <unk> " ) . He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation , however , and sold the film , stage and merchandise rights of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968 . United Artists never made a film , although director John Boorman was planning a live @-@ action film in the early 1970s . In 1976 the rights were sold to Tolkien Enterprises , a division of the Saul Zaentz Company , and the first movie adaptation of The Lord of the Rings appeared in 1978 , an animated rotoscoping film directed by Ralph Bakshi with screenplay by the fantasy writer Peter S. Beagle . It covered only the first half of the story of The Lord of the Rings . In 1977 an animated TV production of The Hobbit was made by Rankin @-@ Bass , and in 1980 they produced an animated The Return of the King , which covered some of the portions of The Lord of the Rings that Bakshi was unable to complete . 
 From 2001 to 2003 , New Line Cinema released The Lord of the Rings as a trilogy of live @-@ action films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by Peter Jackson . The series was successful , performing extremely well commercially and winning numerous Oscars . 
 A series of three films based on The Hobbit , with Peter Jackson serving as executive producer , director , and co @-@ writer , were released in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 . The first instalment , The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey was released in December 2012 , and the second , The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug was released in December 2013 . The last instalment The Hobbit : The Battle of the Five Armies was released in December 2014 .

 Tolkien and the characters and places from his works have become the namesake of various things around the World . These include street names , mountains , companies , species of animals and plants as well as other notable objects . 
 By convention , certain classes of features on Saturn 's moon Titan are named after elements from Middle @-@ earth . Colles ( small hills or knobs ) are named for characters , while montes ( mountains ) are named for mountains of Middle @-@ earth . There are also asteroids named for Bilbo Baggins and Tolkien himself . 
 Three mountains in the Cadwallader Range of British Columbia , Canada , have been named after Tolkien 's characters . These are Mount <unk> , Mount Gandalf and Mount Aragorn . On 1 December 2012 , it was announced in the New Zealand press that a bid was launched for the New Zealand Geographic Board to name a mountain peak near Milford Sound after Tolkien for historical and literary reasons and to mark Tolkien 's 121st birthday . 
 The " Tolkien Road " in Eastbourne , East Sussex , was named after Tolkien whereas the " Tolkien Way " in Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent is named after Tolkien 's eldest son , Fr . John Francis Tolkien , who was the priest in charge at the nearby Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St. Peter in Chains . In the Hall Green and Moseley areas of Birmingham there are a number of parks and walkways dedicated to J. R. R. Tolkien — most notably , the <unk> Way and Moseley Bog .

 = New York State Route 63 = 
 New York State Route 63 ( NY 63 ) is a state highway in the western part of New York in the United States . It extends for 82 @.@ 11 miles ( 132 @.@ 14 km ) in a generally southeast – northwest direction from an intersection with NY 15 and NY 21 in the village of Wayland in Steuben County to a junction with NY 18 in the town of Yates in Orleans County , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) south of the Lake Ontario shoreline . The route passes through the city of Batavia and enters or comes near several villages , including Dansville and Medina . 
 NY 63 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , but to a largely different routing than it follows today . The original alignment of NY 63 was identical to its current alignment between Mount Morris and Pavilion ; however , the route deviated significantly from its modern routing past those points as it extended southwest from Mount Morris to Hinsdale and north from Pavilion to Hamlin . It was rerouted north of Pavilion c . 1939 and south of Mount Morris in the early 1940s . The latter realignment supplanted New York State Route 36A , a Dansville – Mount Morris highway assigned in 1930 . For a brief period during the 1970s , NY 63 began in Dansville instead of Wayland . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = Wayland to Geneseo = = = 
 NY 63 begins at a four @-@ way intersection with NY 15 and NY 21 in the village of Wayland , located in northern Steuben County . It heads west through the village on the two @-@ lane West Naples Street to a less developed part of the town of Wayland , where it parallels Interstate 390 ( I @-@ 390 ) on the north side of a wide valley . The route soon enters Livingston County and the town of North Dansville , gaining the name Main Street as it bends northwestward into the village of Dansville . Here , it overlaps with NY 36 for one block through the village center , beginning at Clara Barton Street and ending at Ossian Street . After another block , NY 63 meets the south end of NY 256 at <unk> Street . While NY 256 heads north toward <unk> Lake , NY 63 proceeds northwest past Dansville Municipal Airport and out of the village limits . 
 Continuing north into the town of Sparta , NY 63 runs along the east side of a wide , rural valley surrounding Canaseraga Creek , with NY 36 and I @-@ 390 following the west side . The route eventually reaches the town of Groveland and hamlet of Groveland Station , where NY 258 , a connector to NY 36 , comes in from the west at the town line . Another long , open stretch brings the route to the vicinity of the village of Mount Morris , where it runs much closer to I @-@ 390 and indirectly connects to the expressway by way of NY 408 at Hampton Corners . From this point north , the road becomes busier as NY 63 is the primary route to the village of Geneseo for northbound traffic on I @-@ 390 itself , as there is no exit at the point where the expressway crosses under NY 63 . I @-@ 390 ultimately bypasses Geneseo to the southeast while NY 63 heads north toward the village , briefly joining with U.S. Route 20A ( US 20A ) and NY 39 just outside the village limits . 
 = = = Geneseo to Batavia = = = 
 The highway enters Geneseo from the south , taking the name Genesee Street as it passes the western edge of the campus of SUNY Geneseo . At the edge of the campus , the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo . Past the river in the town of York , NY 63 begins to curve northwest up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs east – west once again at the hamlet of <unk> . The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville , where NY 63 reconnects with NY 36 . This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area , despite remaining a two @-@ lane road through open rural country , since it is both physically shorter than going all the way to the New York State Thruway as well as toll @-@ free . Most of this Buffalo @-@ bound traffic follows NY 36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY 63 here . Signage along this route reflects this use . 
 From Greigsville , the route heads west through open land into the northeast corner of Wyoming County and the town of Covington . At Peoria , the highway turns to head due northwest , its direction for the next 30 miles ( 48 km ) . The bend at Peoria was once a sharp , accident @-@ prone turn known as Peoria Curve ; however , the route has been slightly realigned to the north to create a longer , more gradual curve . From Peoria , NY 63 runs across rolling , open terrain to the Genesee County line and the town of Pavilion . Just past the county line , the route connects to the northern end of NY 246 . A mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) beyond , NY 63 drops down slightly to intersect with NY 19 at the hamlet of Pavilion . After the traffic light at the center of the hamlet , NY 63 crosses Oatka Creek and climbs back up out of the Wyoming Valley . 
 Once atop the hill , it continues due northwest to its next junction , the underdeveloped crossing of US 20 . Here at least some Buffalo @-@ bound traffic will turn west . Eventually acquiring the name Ellicott Street , NY 63 crosses sparsely populated parts of the towns of Bethany and Batavia on its way to the city of Batavia . The route passes under the Depew , Lancaster and Western Railroad and the CSX Transportation @-@ owned Rochester Subdivision rail line on its way into downtown , where it intersects the two major east – west trunk routes in this corridor , NY 5 and NY 33 . It overlaps with both roads for several blocks along Main Street , with NY 33 splitting off at Oak Street . This junction is also where NY 63 meets the north – south NY 98 , which connects to the Thruway just north of the city . 
 = = = Batavia to Yates = = = 
 NY 63 forks from NY 5 at the western city line , returning to the town of Batavia , changing names to Lewiston Road as it passes by Batavia Downs and runs northwest from downtown . The highway crosses over the Thruway with no access to the highway on its way across another rural stretch leading to the village of Oakfield , located in the town of the same name , where NY 262 departs to the east . Just north of Oakfield , NY 63 turns due west on Judge Road , with Lewiston Road continuing northwest as County Route 12 ( CR 12 ) . NY 63 follows Judge Road into the town of Alabama , passing through the hamlet of South Alabama on its way to an undeveloped junction with NY 77 north of <unk> . NY 63 turns north here , overlapping with NY 77 for 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to the hamlet of Alabama . In the center of the community , NY 63 reconnects to CR 12 , and NY 77 turns west to follow the county road to the Niagara County line . 
 Past Alabama , NY 63 continues northward across the Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge and into Orleans County . It traverses open , undeveloped areas of the town of Shelby to reach the village of Medina . This village begins at a junction with NY 31 and NY 31A . The latter highway continues eastward while the former joins NY 63 through the village 's historic central district on Main Street . At Center Street , NY 31E comes in from the west and NY 31 leaves NY 63 to continue east . NY 63 continues northwest on Main and Commercial streets to the edge of the village , where it turns northward onto Prospect Avenue and subsequently crosses over the Erie Canal . The northernmost two blocks of the overlap with NY 31 are maintained by the village of Medina , as are the two blocks of Main Street leading away from the north end of the concurrency . This is the only segment of NY 63 not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) . 
 For the next 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) , the highway serves a stretch of scattered homes along the western bank of Oak Orchard Creek . It traverses a mix of fields and forests to reach the town and hamlet of Ridgeway , the latter located at NY 63 's junction with NY 104 . NY 63 briefly overlaps the east – west trunk road before resuming a northerly , downhill alignment toward the town of Yates . The route passes through the village of Lyndonville as Main Street , crossing over Johnson Creek in the center of the community before intersecting NY 18 about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) north of the village limits in the hamlet of Yates Center . NY 63 ends here while the highway continues north toward Lake Ontario as Lyndonville Road . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins and designation = = = 
 The New York State Legislature created a statewide system of unsigned legislative routes in 1908 , with two of the routes using parts of what is now NY 63 . The stretch of NY 63 connecting Dansville to Hampton Corners in the town of Mount Morris became part of Route 15 , a highway continuing south to Hornell and north through Mount Morris to Caledonia . Farther north , the piece between Medina and Ridgeway was designated as part of Route 30 , a cross @-@ state route running from Niagara Falls to Rouses Point . Route 30 originally followed current NY 31 to Rochester ; however , it was realigned on March 1 , 1921 , to use Ridge Road instead , bypassing the Medina – Ridgeway highway . 
 In the mid @-@ 1920s , three sections of modern NY 63 received posted route numbers for the first time . From Wayland to Dansville , the road was the westernmost part of NY 52 . What is now NY 63 was unnumbered from Dansville northwest to Hampton Corners , where NY 36 entered from the west on current NY 408 and followed the path of NY 63 to Geneseo . The road was unnumbered again until Pavilion , at which point NY 62 joined from the south and utilized all of current NY 63 and CR 63 @-@ 1 to reach the Lake Ontario shoreline in Yates . By 1926 , all numbered portions of current NY 63 were state @-@ maintained , as were the unnumbered parts from Geneseo to <unk> and from Groveland to Hampton Corners . 
 NY 63 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . The initial routing of NY 63 was significantly different from its modern alignment ; in fact , the only portion of modern NY 63 that still follows its original alignment is the section between Hampton Corners and Pavilion . South of Mount Morris , the route followed what is now NY 408 to Dalton and continued south on Old State Road and west on Allegany County 's CR 16 to NY 19 west of the village of Angelica . NY 63 overlapped NY 19 south to Belvidere , where NY 63 turned onto modern CR 20 . It continued west on CR 20 and NY 446 through Cuba to a junction with NY 16 in Hinsdale , where it ended . North of Pavilion , NY 63 followed modern NY 19 to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Hamlin . 
 = = = Alignment changes = = = 
 The portion of what is now NY 63 north of Pavilion was designated as part of NY 19 in the 1930 renumbering . However , unlike current NY 63 , NY 19 continued north for another 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) on Lyndonville Road past NY 18 to the Lake Ontario shoreline . South of Mount Morris , modern NY 63 was designated as NY 36A from Mount Morris to Dansville . From Dansville to Wayland , the highway was part of NY 39 ( later NY 245 ) , a new route that replaced NY 52 in the 1930 renumbering . The first change to NY 63 came c . 1939 when the alignments of NY 19 and NY 63 were swapped , placing both routes on their modern alignments . NY 63 was altered again in the early 1940s to follow the former routing of NY 36A south from Mount Morris to Dansville , from where it continued east to Wayland by way of an overlap with NY 245 . 
 NY 245 was truncated northeastward to Naples c . 1972 and NY 63 was cut back to NY 36 in Dansville around the same time , leaving the Dansville – Wayland highway as an unsigned reference route . This was partially reversed in the late 1970s or early 1980s when NY 63 was reextended to Wayland . On April 1 , 1989 , ownership and maintenance of Lyndonville Road north of NY 18 was transferred from the state of New York to Orleans County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . NY 63 was truncated to end at its junction with NY 18 while its former routing to the lake became CR 63 @-@ 1 . 
 In the mid @-@ 2000s , the route was reconfigured in the northern part of Medina to use Main and Commercial streets instead of Center Street and Prospect Avenue . The change was made as part of a village project known as the Pass Thru Project , and the realignment eliminated a three @-@ block overlap with the easternmost part of NY 31E on Center Street . Ownership and maintenance of NY 63 's former alignment was transferred from the state to the village on July 1 , 2010 , as part of a highway maintenance swap that gave Commercial Street and the northernmost block of Main Street to the state . 
 = = = Proposed Mount Morris – Pavilion bypass = = = 
 As part of a large scale study in the early 2000s , NYSDOT determined that NY 63 from Mount Morris to Pavilion , along with US 20 and NY 77 — termed the " Route 63 Corridor " — were major trouble routes , primarily because of increased truck traffic using the corridor as a bypass between I @-@ 390 in Mount Morris and the New York State Thruway in Pembroke . The most publicized and perhaps most fought @-@ over possibility mentioned was that of a new expressway from Mount Morris to Pembroke , bypassing these three routes . The Wyoming County Chamber of Commerce was a driving force behind this , hoping interchanges in Perry , Warsaw and Attica would promote business growth . 
 While residents along the NY 63 corridor are against the increased truck traffic along the corridor ( spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement ) , most of those same residents , along with other groups , also fought the proposed expressway . The general consensus of all of these groups is that NYSDOT should impose restrictions on the NY 63 corridor and force trucks to remain on I @-@ 390 and the Thruway to travel between Buffalo and Pennsylvania .

 NY 63A was an alternate route of NY 63 between Angelica , Allegany County , and Nunda , Livingston County . The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering and redesignated as NY 408A in the early 1940s .

 = = = Junior = = = 
 Pardy was selected by the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) in 2002 , but was unable to earn a spot on Halifax 's deep roster . As a result , he began the 2002 – 03 season in the Maritime Junior A Hockey League playing first for the Yarmouth Mariners and then the Antigonish Bulldogs . His QMJHL rights were traded to the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles in January 2003 , but the Bulldogs refused to release him at first as they wished to keep him for their own playoff run . He was finally given his release to play with the Screaming Eagles late in the season and appeared in seven regular season games in the Quebec League and two more in the playoffs . 
 He then played two full seasons with the Screaming Eagles . Pardy played 68 games for Cape Breton in 2003 – 04 , scoring four goals and 12 points , adding 137 penalty minutes . Following the season , the Calgary Flames selected him as their sixth round selection , 173rd overall , at the 2004 NHL Entry Draft . His selection at the age of 20 was unusual , as it came two years after most players are drafted and was his third time through the draft after being passed over in 2002 and 2003 . He improved to 12 goals , 27 assists and 163 penalty minutes in 2004 – 05 as an over @-@ age player . Pardy played a total of 144 games for the Screaming Eagles , recording 16 goals , 40 assists and 302 penalty minutes . 
 = = = Professional = = = 
 Pardy turned professional in 2005 and began the season with Calgary 's American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Omaha Ak @-@ Sar @-@ Ben Knights . He struggled at first ; he failed to score and was a minus player in his first 24 games , resulting in a demotion to the ECHL 's Las Vegas Wranglers . He found greater success in Las Vegas , scoring his first professional goal and adding 11 assists in 41 games . He appeared in 70 games with Omaha in his first full AHL season in 2006 – 07 , scoring two goals and six assists . Pardy did not earn much ice time initially as the coaches played him sparingly for the first three months of the season . As his play improved , he earned greater responsibilities with the Knights . 
 Entering his third season of professional hockey in 2007 – 08 , Pardy continued to impress the Flames organization with his development , and while he did not make the team out of training camp , he was one of the final cuts . He joined the Quad City Flames for the season , and was briefly recalled to Calgary in December 2007 as an injury replacement , but did not appear in any games with the Flames . He finished the season in Quad City , scoring five goals and 18 points in 65 games , and played in the 2008 AHL All @-@ Star Game . 
 Hoping to build on that season , Pardy entered 2008 – 09 training camp looking to earn a spot with the Flames . He signed a new , one @-@ year contract , and made the team out of camp . Pardy made his NHL debut in the team 's season opener on October 9 , 2008 . He played just under eight minutes in a 6 – 0 loss to the Vancouver Canucks . In doing so , he became the first former Las Vegas Wranglers skater to play an NHL game . Pardy was used sparingly early in the season , but gained a full @-@ time spot in the lineup in November when Jim Vandermeer suffered a broken ankle . 
 He scored his first NHL point , an assist , in a 3 – 2 shootout loss to the Florida Panthers on December 12 , 2008 . Against the New York Islanders on January 8 , 2009 , he scored his first career goal . Pardy finished his rookie season with 60 games played , one goal and nine assists . He also appeared in six playoff games . Because of his age and low number of NHL games played , he was an unrestricted free agent following the season . The Flames made re @-@ signing him a priority , agreeing to a two @-@ year , US $ 1 @.@ 4 million contract that was worth less than he might have received on the open market . 
 Despite a slow start at training camp , Pardy retained his position as the team 's sixth defenceman entering the 2009 – 10 season . He missed three games early in the season with a sprained wrist , and was left as the seventh defenceman late in the year after the Flames acquired Steve Staios . He finished his second NHL season with two goals and seven assists in 57 games . Pardy suffered a separated shoulder in the second game of the 2010 – 11 season , an injury that caused him to miss the first two months of the season . He also missed the last two months of the season with an upper body injury . 
 An unrestricted free agent , Pardy left the Flames after the 2010 – 11 season and signed a two @-@ year , $ 4 million contract with the Dallas Stars . He began the season on injured reserve after suffering a rib injury in the pre @-@ season , and spent much of the season out of the Stars ' lineup . He finished the 2011 – 12 season with three assists in 36 games played . 
 Pardy played only one season in Dallas , as he was included in a July 2 , 2012 trade that also sent Steve Ott to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Derek Roy . Pardy split the lockout @-@ shortened season between Buffalo and the AHL 's Rochester Americans . He had two goals and seven assists in 21 AHL games , and added four assists in 17 games in Buffalo . As a free agent , Pardy joined his fourth team in four seasons , signing a one @-@ year , $ 600 @,@ 000 contract with the Winnipeg Jets for the 2013 – 14 season . Pardy would sign a one @-@ year , $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 extension for the Jets , on July 1 , 2015 . 
 During the 2015 – 16 season , having played sparingly in 14 games with the Jets , Pardy was placed on waivers and claimed by the Edmonton Oilers on February 29 , 2016 . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Pardy is not an offensive defenceman , instead focusing his play on preventing his opposition from scoring . His defensive partner , Cory Sarich , praised his calm demeanor heading into the 2009 – 10 season . He also plays a physical game , recording 77 hits in 60 games as a rookie , including a check on Jared Boll that was described as one of the best of the 2008 – 09 season .

 Pardy grew up in Bonavista , Newfoundland , a town of about 3 @,@ 800 people .

His family has since followed him to Alberta . Pardy 's father works in construction in Lloydminster , and his brothers are electricians in Calgary . 
 In addition to ice hockey , Pardy played ball hockey while a junior . He was named the most valuable defenceman at the 2003 junior nationals by the Canadian Ball Hockey Association . He won a bronze medal with the Canadian team at the 2004 World Ball Hockey Championships in Slovakia . 
 Pardy is a spokesman for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Calgary .

 = Devi Upanishad = 
 The Devi Upanishad ( Sanskrit : <unk> उपनिषत ् ) , is one of the minor Upanishads of Hinduism and a text composed in Sanskrit . It is one of the 19 Upanishads attached to the Atharvaveda , and is classified as one of the eight Shakta Upanishads . It is , as an Upanishad , a part of the corpus of Vedanta literature collection that present the philosophical concepts of Hinduism . 
 The text was likely composed between 9th- to 14th @-@ centuries CE . It refers to Mahadevi as representing all goddesses . The Devi Upanishad is part of the five <unk> Upanishads important to Tantra and Shakta philosophy traditions . 
 The Upanishad states that the Goddess is the Brahman ( ultimate metaphysical Reality ) , and from her arise Prakṛti ( matter ) and Purusha ( consciousness ) . She is bliss and non @-@ bliss , the Vedas and what is different from it , the born and the unborn , and all of the universe . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Devi and Deva are Sanskrit terms found in the Vedic literature , such as the Rigveda of the 2nd millennium BCE . Deva is masculine , and the related feminine equivalent is Devi . They mean " heavenly , divine , terrestrial things of high excellence , exalted , shining ones " . Etymologically , the cognates of Devi are Latin dea and Greek thea . 
 The term Upanishad means it is knowledge or " hidden doctrine " text that belongs to the corpus of Vedanta literature collection presenting the philosophical concepts of Hinduism and considered the highest purpose of its scripture , the Vedas . 
 = = History = = 
 According to Cheever Mackenzie Brown – a professor of Religion at the Trinity University , this important Tantric and Shaktism text was probably composed sometime between the ninth and fourteenth centuries CE . 
 The Devi Upanishad is part of the five Atharva Shiras Upanishads , each of which are named after the five main deities or shrines ( <unk> ) of Ganapati , Narayana , Rudra , Surya and Devi . Its philosophy is also found in the Tripura Upanishad , <unk> Upanishad , and the <unk> Upanishad . 
 Composed in Sanskrit , it is a minor Upanishad . The text is listed at 81 in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads found in the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman . Some manuscripts of this Upanishad are titled as the <unk> ( <unk> ् <unk> ् ) . 
 = = Foundation and structure = = 
 The Devi Upanishad comprises 32 verses after an invocation from the Atharvaveda . The text describes the goddess as the highest principle , and the ultimate truth in the universe ( Brahman ) . 
 The foundational premises of reverence for the feminine , as stated in the Devi Upanishad , are present in the Rigveda , in the following hymn , 
 The Devi Upanishad , in a manner similar to this Rigvedic hymn , asserts that from the Goddess arise Prakṛti ( matter ) and Purusha ( consciousness ) , she is bliss and non @-@ bliss , from her emerged the Vedas and what is different from it , the born and the unborn , and all of the universe . She suggests that " Brahman and non @-@ Brahman must be known " , that she is all the five elements , as well as all that is different from these elements , what is above , what is below , what is around , and thus the universe in its entirety . She , states the text , is the creative power of Shiva . It refers to Mahadevi or " supreme goddess " , as representing all goddesses .

 = = = Who is the Goddess ? = = = 
 The Devi Upanishad opens with a gathering of gods , who ask , " Great Goddess , who are you ? " 
 The Devi asserts that she is <unk> – identical in form to – Brahman . In verses 2 and 3 , states Thomas B. Coburn , Devi explains her forms of nirguna ( without attributes ) and <unk> ( with attributes ) , the true being ( Sat ) , the consciousness ( Citta ) and the bliss ( Anand ) . 
 The verses 2 and 3 further assert that she is the universe , the <unk> ( nature ) and Purusha ( consciousness ) , the knowledge and ignorance , Brahman and Non @-@ Brahman , the Vedas and whatever is different from it , " the unborn and the born , I am below , above and around " . 
 In verses 4 and 5 , the Devi Upanishad mirrors the opening verses of the Devi <unk> hymn of the Rigveda . 
 The first five verses of the Devi Upanishad resonate with ideas from the Mahanarayana Upanishad and the Shvetashvatara Upanishad . There , states June McDaniel – a Professor of Religious Studies , the ideas of metaphysical reality called Brahman is in " everything below , around and above is her own personification " . 
 After suggesting in the first six verses that she is identical with Mahadevi , Durga , Kali , Mahalakshmi , Vaishnavi , Saraswati and all goddesses , Devi asserts that it is she to whom the oblations of any Yajna ( fire rituals ) reach . In verse 7 , with a hymn structure resonating with the Gayatri Mantra , the Devi states , that one who knows " my essence in the water of the inner sea " , attains her . 
 = = = Devi <unk> and iconography = = = 
 In verses 8 through 14 , the gathered gods acknowledge Devi 's answer . They accept , states Devi Upanishad , that she is the Shakti , the Maha @-@ vidya ( the great knowledge ) , the Vedas , the power of Vishnu , she is the inspirer , she is the reason that gods were born , she is the love in the universe , the primordial source of universe , the bearer of thunderbolt , the cave , the wind , the cloud , the enchanting , the power of Self . This part of the Upanishad is the same as the Devi <unk> in Devi Gita 1 @.@ 44 – 1 @.@ 48 . 
 In verse 15 , in an iconographic description of the Great Goddess , the text states Devi carries a noose , a goad , a bow and arrow , and enchants all . 
 According to verse 18 , she is venerated because Devi is eight attendant deities of Indra ( " Vasus " ) ; the eleven Rudras ; and the twelve <unk> or sun gods representing each month of a year . She represents all gods who consume the Vedic ritual drink Soma or those who choose not to . She is also all the goblins , the demons , the evil beings , the ghosts , the super @-@ human and the semi @-@ divine , the planets , stars and all that shines in the sky , she is time and its divisions , she is everything that was , is and will be in the universe . 
 She is , states the text , the three Guṇas – Sattva , Rajas and Tamas . She is Prajapati , Indra and Manu . She is infinite , pure , Shiva , refuge and the giver of that which is good , states verse 19 . 
 In another iconic description , in verses 20 and 24 , the texts says that she is seated in one 's " lotus heart " , adorned with a crescent moon , conjoined with fire , glowing like the early morning sun , propitious , armed with the " noose and goad " , with expressions marking her benevolence and dissolving fears , and that she is three eyed , attired in red , tender , bestows all wishes to her devotees . 
 = = = Epilogue = = = 
 The Upanishad , in verses 26 to 28 , asserts that Devi is " <unk> , the Endless , the <unk> , the Unknown , the One and the Many . " The Upanishad states that Devi is the fountainhead of all mantras . All knowledge is her inherent characteristic , beyond her there is nothing , she is the pilot of worldly life . 
 In verses 29 to 32 , the benefits of reciting this Upanishad , at specific times and days are explained . <unk> the Upanishad ten times removes all sins and obstacles ; also prescribes recitation in the morning and evening hours to get the same benefits . Recitation at midnight makes one 's speech perfect . Recitation during the consecration of an image of a deity <unk> the image with energy . 
 = = Influence in Tantra = = 
 The tantric aspect in this Upanishad , says McDaniel , is in the usage of the terms yantra , bindu , bija , mantra , shakti and chakra . 
 The five verses from 8 to 12 form part of the Devi <unk> ( in Devi Gita 1 @.@ 44 – 48 ) . This reflects the <unk> of tantric nature of the Devi Upanishad , a fusion , which the author of the Devi Gita says " as one of those texts whose recitation is pleasing to her . " Her progeny through Shiva like Aditi and Skanda , her comradeship with goddesses like Saraswati and Lakshmi , her status as Maya ( the empirical reality ) and her representation of the wind , the cloud and Indra are all recalled in verses 8 to 14 . 
 = Timothy Blackstone = 
 Timothy Beach Blackstone ( March 28 , 1829 – May 26 , 1900 ) was a 19th @-@ century railroad executive , businessman , philanthropist , and politician . He is descended from one of the earliest British settlers of New England , William Blaxton . Blackstone worked in the railroad industry for most of his life after dropping out of school . At the time of his death , his estate was worth US $ 6 million ( $ 170 @.@ 7 million today ) . 
 Blackstone served as president of the Chicago and Alton Railroad from 1864 through 1899 , was a founding president of the Union Stock Yards , and served one term as mayor of La Salle , Illinois . An active philanthropist , Blackstone was the benefactor of the James Blackstone Memorial Library in Branford , Connecticut . A nearly identical library , Blackstone Memorial Library , was donated to the Chicago Public Library by Timothy Blackstone 's widow in 1902 . The Blackstones also funded Blackstone Hall for the Art Institute of Chicago Building . Chicago 's Blackstone Library is the first dedicated branch of the Chicago Public Library system , and later his mansion became the site of the Blackstone Hotel and the Blackstone Theatre . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Blackstone was born in Branford , Connecticut , the sixth child , and fourth son , of James Blackstone and Sarah Beach . His father , James , served in the Connecticut Senate representing the sixth district . James had also served in the Connecticut House of Representatives and the Connecticut militia . The family is descended from William Blaxton , an English settler who arrived in New England in the seventeenth century and became the first European settler in Rhode Island . William Blackstone , an English judge and jurist , is a distant cousin . 
 Health issues caused Blackstone to drop out of school in 1847 , and he began working for Roswell B. Mason , surveying the New York and New Haven Railroad ( NY & NH ) . He only worked on the NY & NH for a year before becoming an assistant engineer on the Stockbridge and Pittsfield Railroad . Again , he only remained with the firm a short time before leaving for the Vermont Valley Railroad . In 1851 , Roswell invited Blackstone to supervise construction of the Illinois Central Railroad between Bloomington and Dixon , Illinois . Blackstone accepted the job and moved to La Salle , Illinois . 
 = = Career and life = = 
 Blackstone was elected mayor of LaSalle in 1854 and served a single term , his only foray into politics . After leaving office , he returned to working on railroads , first as chief engineer of the Joliet and Chicago Railroad , which would eventually become the Chicago and Alton Railroad . Blackstone became president of the Joliet and Chicago Railroad in 1861 , and he kept the line solvent while other divisions were filing for bankruptcy . When the system was reorganized , he was named president of the board of directors for the company , serving with John Drake . Although Blackstone served with the Alton Railroad for more than a quarter century , he refused a salary . When the directors voted to pay him $ 10 @,@ 000 per year , he turned it down . In addition to his employment and activities with the railroads , Blackstone was the first president of the company that controlled the Union Stock Yards . 
 Although Blackstone had refused a salary from the railroad , he was an investor in it . In 1899 , a competing group of investors headed by E. H. Harriman wanted to purchase the Alton Railroad but Blackstone disapproved of the sale . After many months of wrangling , Blackstone transferred all of his stock in the company to the United States Trust Company and resigned as president , effective April 1 , 1899 . This action allowed the Harriman @-@ led group to assume control of the line . 
 In 1868 , Blackstone married Isabella Farnsworth Norton , the daughter of a successful businessman from Norwich , Connecticut . Blackstone died of pneumonia on May 26 , 1900 , in Chicago , Illinois . His funeral was held at the Second Presbyterian Church and was then transported to Norwich , Connecticut for burial .

 Blackstone built a 19th @-@ century mansion for himself at 252 Michigan Avenue in Chicago in what is now the Historic Michigan Boulevard District . The property later became the site of the Blackstone Hotel and the Blackstone Theatre . Following the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 , he invited his friend John Crerar to stay with him , which Crerar did for twelve years . Crerar donated the John Crerar Library and Blackstone continued to donate funds toward the maintenance of the building throughout his life . The Crerar Library has now merged with the University of Chicago . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Blackstone donated a library of 5 @,@ 000 books and a building to the city of Branford , Connecticut with the only stipulation that it be named in honor of his father . A charter was devised for the library by the Connecticut State Legislature vesting control of the library in a self @-@ perpetuating board of trustees consisting of six residents of Branford and the librarian of Yale University . The building was designed by Chicago architect Solon Spencer Beman . The library was constructed from 1893 – 96 . 
 In 1904 , Isabella Blackstone donated the T.B. Blackstone Memorial Branch Library to the city of Chicago . Located at the intersection of Blackstone Avenue , Lake Park Avenue , and Forty @-@ Ninth Street , the library is modeled after the James Blackstone Library in Branford , Connecticut . Blackstone Avenue running along the 1436 east block from 4900 south ( starting behind Blackstone Library ) to <unk> south is named after him . 
 Also , the Blackstone 's funded Blackstone Hall in the Art Institute of Chicago Building . The two @-@ story ground level gallery was added next to the east wall of the original building for display of architectural and sculptural casts . 
 The New York Times published details of his will . When Blackstone died , his will directed the disposition of his assets that amounted to US $ 6 million ( $ 170 @.@ 7 million today ) . Of that total , $ 375 @,@ 000 was bequeathed to relatives and $ 250 @,@ 000 to public institutions ( Chicago Art Institute , Chicago Orphan Asylum , Home for the Friendless at Chicago , St. Luke 's Hospital , Passavant Memorial Hospital , Chicago Relief and Aid Society , $ 25 @,@ 000 each and James Blackstone Memorial Library Association , $ 100 @,@ 000 ) .

 SMS Wettin ( " His Majesty 's Ship Wettin " ) was a German pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Wittelsbach class of the Kaiserliche Marine . She was built in Schichau , in Danzig . Wettin was laid down in November 1899 , and completed October 1902 , at the cost of 22 @,@ 597 @,@ 000 marks . Her sister ships were Wittelsbach , Zähringen , Schwaben and Mecklenburg ; they were the first capital ships built under the Navy Law of 1898 , brought about by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz . 
 Wettin saw active duty in the I Squadron of the German fleet for the majority of her career . After the start of World War I in August 1914 , the ship was mobilized with her sisters as the IV Battle Squadron . She saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea against Russian forces , though the threat from British submarines forced the ship to withdraw by 1916 . For the remainder of the war , Wettin served as a training ship for navy cadets and as a depot ship . After the end of the war , the ship was stricken from the navy list and sold for scrapping in 1921 . Her bell is currently on display at the Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr in Dresden .

 Wettin was 126 @.@ 8 m ( 416 ft 0 in ) long overall and had a beam of 22 @.@ 8 m ( 74 ft 10 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 95 m ( 26 ft 1 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 04 m ( 26 ft 5 in ) aft . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws . Steam was provided by six naval and six cylindrical coal @-@ fired water @-@ tube boilers . Wettin 's powerplant was rated at 14 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 13 @,@ 808 ihp ; 10 @,@ 297 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men . 
 Wettin 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns .

The main battery turrets had 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armor plating . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Wettin 's keel was laid on 10 October 1899 , at the Schichau @-@ Werke in Danzig , under construction number 676 . She was ordered under the contract name " D " , as a new unit for the fleet . The vessel was a member of the first class of battleships built under the direction of State Secretary Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , according to the terms of the Navy Law of 1898 . Wettin was launched on 6 June 1901 ; King Albert of Saxony , a member of the House of Wettin , gave a speech at the ceremony . In August 1902 , a crew of 60 men took the ship to Kiel for sea trials , which were supervised by Konteradmiral ( Rear Admiral ) <unk> von <unk> . During the trials , Kaiser Wilhelm II , aboard his yacht Hohenzollern , reviewed Wettin while she was in Swinemünde on 10 August . The ship was commissioned on 1 October 1902 , the first member of her class to enter service . The ship 's cost totaled 22 @,@ 597 @,@ 000 marks . 
 After she was commissioned into the fleet , Wettin resumed sea trials , which were completed by January 1903 . She was assigned to the I Squadron of the fleet , where she replaced the battleship Weissenburg . In March 1905 , Wettin was sent to assist her sister ship Mecklenburg , which had run aground in the Great Belt . That year , the German fleet was reorganized into two squadrons of battleships . Wettin was assigned to the I Division of I Squadron , alongside her sister ships Zähringen and Wittelsbach . The German fleet at that time consisted of another three @-@ ship division in the I Squadron and 2 three @-@ ship divisions in the II Squadron . This was supported by a reconnaissance division , composed of two armored cruisers and six protected cruisers . 
 The Deutschland @-@ class battleships — the most powerful battleships yet built in Germany — were beginning to enter service by 1907 . This provided the Navy with enough ships to form a second full battle squadron composed of another eight ships . The fleet was then renamed the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) . Starting in 1911 , Wettin was employed as an artillery training ship for German gunners . This work lasted until 1914 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 By 1914 , Wettin and her sisters were removed from active service and placed in the reserve squadron . However , after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Wettin and the rest of her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron , under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt . Starting on 3 September , the IV Squadron , assisted by the armored cruiser Blücher , conducted a sweep into the Baltic . The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle . In May 1915 , IV Squadron , including Wettin , was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area . Wettin and her sisters were then based in Kiel . 
 On 6 May , the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on Libau . Wettin and the other ships stood off Gotland in order to intercept any Russian cruisers that might try to intervene in the landings , which the Russians did not attempt . On 10 May , after the invasion force had entered Libau , the British submarines HMS E1 and HMS E9 spotted the IV Squadron , but were too far away to make an attack . Wettin and her sister ships were not included in the German fleet that assaulted the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 , due to the scarcity of escorts . The increasingly active British submarines forced the Germans to employ more destroyers to protect the capital ships . 
 By 1916 , the increasing threat from British submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly Wittelsbach @-@ class ships from active service . Wettin was subsequently used as a training ship for naval cadets ; she also acted as a depot ship . The ship was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1920 and sold to ship breakers on 21 November 1921 . Wettin was broken up for scrap the following year in Rönnebeck , a part of Bremen . Her bell is on display at the Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr in Dresden .

" Christmas Special " originally aired on NBC in the United States on December 11 , 2008 . 
 The story with the Jack Donaghy character accidentally hitting his mother with his car was based on an experience by one of the 30 Rock writers . According to executive producer Robert Carlock : " This actually happened . The niece of one of our writers hit her grandmother — the writer 's mother — with her car .

 Critical reception of the episode was not entirely favorable . Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star @-@ Ledger commented that he had not really liked any of Elaine Stritch 's appearances as Jack 's mother on the series , writing that " Jack 's fear and loathing of his mother just feels claustrophobic and uncomfortable instead of funny , and I 'm as eager to see the end of her visits as [ Jack ] usually is . " Sepinwall said that " very little " of " Christmas Special " worked . " I want to be in the holiday spirit , but this is two Christmas duds in a row from 30 Rock , and we can 't even blame the looming writers strike this time around . " IGN contributor Robert Canning believed the show could have delivered a Christmas episode , but noted that their attempt at it " was a little less than satisfying . The ideas were there , but the rhythm of the episode was off . " Nonetheless , Canning said the episode was not terrible . He enjoyed all the plots except for Liz 's , writing that it did not quite fit , and that " the overall result of Liz 's plot just wasn 't all that funny . " In conclusion , Canning gave the episode a 7 @.@ 8 out of 10 rating . Jeremy Medina for Paste found that there was nothing " special " about this episode . In his opinion , Liz should be featured in " new and exciting plot line [ s ] " rather than helping Jack endure his troubles with his mother . 
 Not all reviews were negative ; Bob Sassone of AOL 's TV Squad wrote : " I 'm a sucker for Christmas episodes . " He was complimentary towards Stritch 's role as Jack 's mother , citing that she has been " demanding and a little difficult , but she also makes you really feel for her . "

A pop ballad , the song is performed by American singer Heidi Mollenhauer as the singing voice of Esmeralda on American actress Demi Moore 's behalf , who provides the character 's speaking voice . A prayer , " God Help the Outcasts " is a somber hymn in which a beset Esmeralda asks God to shield outcasts and gypsies like herself against racism and discrimination at the hands of Paris and Judge Claude Frollo . The song also establishes Esmeralda as a selfless , empathetic character with whom Quasimodo falls in love . 
 After Menken and Schwartz wrote " God Help the Outcasts " , directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale and Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg debated whether or not the film required a more uplifting song ; Menken and Schwartz wrote the inspirational " Someday " with which to replace " God Help the Outcasts " at the behest of Katzenberg . However , Wise and Trousdale ultimately decided that " God Help the Outcasts " , a religious ballad , was more suitable for the scene . 
 American singer Bette Midler recorded a pop rendition of " God Help the Outcasts " for the film 's soundtrack . " God Help the Outcasts " has garnered generally positive reviews from both film and music critics , who enjoyed the song 's lyrics and music , as well as Mollenhauer 's performance . Others , however , felt that the song was too sentimental and overwrought , specifically Midler 's rendition . In addition to Midler , " God Help the Outcasts " has since been covered several artists , including singer Lara Fabian in Canadian French and The Little Mermaid 's Jodi Benson , also appearing in the stage musical adaptation of the film , performed by Ciara Renée .

 " God Help the Outcasts " was written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz , both songwriters who had just recently collaborated on writing the music for Disney 's Pocahontas ( 1995 ) . Upon completing " God Help the Outcasts " , Menken and Schwartz composed " Someday " at the behest of Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg ; the filmmaker suggested that the dark , somber film required " a more <unk> song of inspiration . " Also a ballad , " Someday " was to have served " as an energetic alternative to ' God Help the Outcasts ' . " Ultimately , directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale decided that “ God Help the Outcasts ” " fit the tone of the scene more effectively . " 
 According to the Deseret News , " Someday " was excluded from The Hunchback of Notre Dame " because it was ... too powerful " , while " God Help the Outcasts " is " a more humble , personal song for Esmeralda to sing as she prayed for God 's help . " Although both " God Help the Outcasts " and " Someday " are similar , " God Help the Outcasts " specifically mentions outcasts while the latter " is about all people coming to together ... for the betterment of everyone . " In addition to this , while " God Help the Outcasts " is religious , " Someday " is , according to The Musical Theater of Stephen Schwartz : From Godspell to Wicked and Beyond , " more of an anthem of hope than a prayer . " 
 Dubbing " God Help the Outcasts " one of the highlights of her career , singer Heidi Mollenhauer described the experience in an interview with South Pasadena High School as " very exciting , a little terrifying , and sometimes overwhelming " . On recording the song , Mollenhauer said , " The challenge really was to be able to release all that this song made me feel . I get choked up every time I talk about it because I think it 's such a beautiful moment . " Because Esmeralda is voiced by two different actresses , it was mandatory that Mollenhauer 's singing voice blend with actress Demi Moore 's husky speaking voice " seamlessly . " Mollenhauer 's performance of " Someday " is featured on the re @-@ release of The Hunchback of Notre Dame . 
 = = Context , scene and analysis = = 
 One of The Hunchback of Notre Dame 's most poignant moments , " God Help the Outcasts " is Esmeralda 's only song . Identified as the film 's " prettiest " musical number , the song occurs immediately after Esmeralda , relentlessly pursued by Judge Frollo , claims sanctuary in the Notre Dame Cathedral upon " see [ ing ] how ... Quasimodo , and her people are treated by others " , according to Defying Gravity : The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz , from Godspell to Wicked " bring [ ing ] with her a bitter and acute awareness of the injustice of her situation . " Preceded by a brief exchange between Esmeralda and the Archdeacon , the latter ultimately suggests that Esmeralda approach God for help , explaining , " You can 't right all the wrongs of this world by yourself , perhaps there 's someone in here who can . " During the " heartwarming " musical sequence , Esmeralda " pray [ s ] selflessly on behalf of the world 's outcasts . " " [ F ] <unk> with religious imagery , " the song " sum [ s ] up everything that [ Esmeralda ] stands for " . Meanwhile , an earnest Quasimodo , enamored with Esmeralda 's beauty and sincerity , hides in the bell tower , " overhearing her prayer " and " being drawn down to her . " 
 In terms of character development , " God Help the Outcasts " establishes Esmeralda as a " thoughtful , empathetic " character , " worthy of our compassion , " " developing Esmeralda ’ s character " while " depict [ ing ] the rest of the Paris <unk> as simple and selfish , asking for wealth and fame for themselves while Esmeralda prays for the salvation of the Gypsy race . " In Tinker Belles and Evil Queens : The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out , author Sean Griffin observed that " the more respectable parishioners pray for wealth , fame and glory . " According to Annalee R. Ward , author of Mouse Morality : The Rhetoric of Disney Animated Film , " God Help the Outcasts " is a " tender prayer @-@ song " in which " Esmeralda expresses a heart full of concern for others , which ultimately Quasimodo mistakes as a heart for him . " Esmeralda is " bathed in colored light from the stained glass window " as " God ’ s light shines down upon Esmeralda " via a rose window . Initially , the song does not specify to whom the prayer is being recited – Mary , Jesus or God . It does , however , does suggest that both Mary and Jesus are former outcasts , much like Esmeralda herself . In The Disney Middle Ages : A Fairy @-@ Tale and Fantasy Past , author Tison Pugh described Esmeralda as " latently or innately Christian . " 
 " ' God Help the Outcasts ' is sung by Esmeralda as an intercessory prayer on the behalf of Quasimodo and her people , the gypsies , whom are treated as outcasts by the rest of their society . Esmeralda begins her prayer by realizing that Jesus Christ must have also known what it was like to be treated as an outcast , for his own people crucified him on the Cross at Calvary . The heart of her prayer can be summed up in this statement , ' I thought we all were the children of God . ' " 
 In Mickey Mouse Monopoly : Disney , Childhood , and Corporate Power , Dr. Robert B. Pettit identified " God Help the Outcasts " as " a plea on behalf of all minorities – not only by ethnicity , but also by race , class , gender , or sexual orientation . " Additionally , Pettit feels that the song " might have been a jab at the homophobic religious right who were organizing a boycott of Disney . " A somber song , " God Help the Outcasts " also " underlines the theme of Victor Hugo ’ s novel " : " At one point in the song , we have a group of rich , well @-@ off Christians asking God for wealth , fame , and love " while " Esmeralda , a penniless gypsy who confessed that she didn ’ t know if God was there , prays for her people and asks that they be shown mercy and love , " additionally " pointing out that Jesus was also an outcast when he walked on this Earth , and that we ’ re all children of God no matter who we are or what we ’ ve done . " The scene additionally suggests " a more positive view of the Church than found in Hugo 's novel " as it provides outcasts such as Esmeralda with both shelter and sanctuary .

 According to the song 's official sheet music , published at Musicnotes.com by Walt Disney Music Publishing , " God Help the Outcasts " is a pop power ballad , written in the key of B ♭ major at a slow tempo of 63 beats per minute in triple 34 time . The vocal range of singer Heidi Mollenhauer , who provided Esmeralda 's singing voice in lieu of actress Demi Moore , spans two octaves , from F3 to C5 . <unk> to the higher key of E ♭ major , Midler 's vocal range also spans two octaves , from B ♭ 3 to F5 . While Mollenhauer 's version spans three minutes and forty @-@ five seconds , Midler 's rendition of " God Help the Outcasts " lasts a shorter length of three minutes and twenty @-@ six seconds . 
 " [ A ] n intercessory prayer , " " God Help the Outcasts " is both " a powerfully quiet song " and a " heart @-@ rending aria " performed with " agony and beauty . " Musically , the " heart @-@ wrenching ballad " " has a Broadway and choral feel to it , " distinct from the majority of The Hunchback of Notre Dame 's songs due in large to its " tenderness . " A " haunting prayer " and a " simple hymn , " " God Help the Outcasts " is " the most spiritual and <unk> [ sic ] tune to emerge from an animated feature . " The ballad , " plain in structure , " is a " hopeful and sweet anthem " and " lilting plea " accompanied by " syrupy production . " According to The Musical Theater of Stephen Schwartz : From Godspell to Wicked and Beyond , " Menken 's melody is mostly a descending , stepwise line in triple meter with constantly moving eighth notes accompanying , " while " Schwartz wrote four dignified , rhymed couplets for the main tune . " 
 According to the book Film Genre 2000 : New Critical Essays , " God Help the Outcasts " has an " unusually somber tone " for an animated Disney film . Performed " as a prayer for deliverance from [ the gypsies ' ] pain and suffering , " lyrically , " God Help the Outcasts , " a song about faith , explores themes such as discrimination . Additionally , “ God Help the Outcasts ” " touches on a basic idea behind most faiths . " Asking " was Jesus [ God ] not an outcast , too , as [ Esmeralda ] sees firsthand how her people , are persecuted for their differences , " the first verse of the song reads , " I don 't know if You can hear me / Or if You 're even there / I don 't know if You would listen / To a gypsy 's prayer . " Teen Ink observed , " This part is about how it seems like God doesn 't listen to you or help you , no matter how much you pray or talk to him . " Finally , asking people to be kind and unselfish , Esmeralda sings , " Please help my people , the poor and downtrodden / I thought we all were the children of God . ” In The Gospel According to Disney , author Mark I. Pinsky drew similarities between " God Help the Outcasts " and the Christian hymn " His Eye Is on the Sparrow , " as both songs explore " the love of God that knows no bounds . " Midler 's shorter rendition , considered a reprise of Mollenhauer 's original , features modified lyrics , replacing " to a gypsy 's prayer " with " to a humble prayer . "

 = Sylvester 's sequence = 
 In number theory , Sylvester 's sequence is an integer sequence in which each member of the sequence is the product of the previous members , plus one . The first few terms of the sequence are : 
 2 , 3 , 7 , 43 , 1807 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ( sequence <unk> in the OEIS ) . 
 Sylvester 's sequence is named after James Joseph Sylvester , who first investigated it in 1880 . Its values grow doubly exponentially , and the sum of its reciprocals forms a series of unit fractions that converges to 1 more rapidly than any other series of unit fractions with the same number of terms . The recurrence by which it is defined allows the numbers in the sequence to be factored more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude , but , due to the rapid growth of the sequence , complete prime factorizations are known only for a few of its members . Values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite Egyptian fraction representations of 1 , Sasakian Einstein manifolds , and hard instances for online algorithms . 
 = = Formal definitions = = 
 Formally , Sylvester 's sequence can be defined by the formula 
 <formula> 
 The product of an empty set is 1 , so s0 
 = 2 . 
 Alternatively , one may define the sequence by the recurrence 
 <formula> with s0 = 
 2 . 
 It is straightforward to show by induction that this is equivalent to the other definition . 
 = = Closed form formula and asymptotics = = 
 The Sylvester numbers grow doubly exponentially as a function of n . Specifically , it can be shown that 
 <formula> 
 for a number E that is approximately 1 @.@ <unk> . This formula has the effect of the following algorithm : 
 s0 is the nearest integer to E2 ; s1 is the nearest integer to E4 ; s2 is the nearest integer to E8 ; for sn , take E2 , square it n more times , and take the nearest integer . 
 This would only be a practical algorithm if we had a better way of calculating E to the requisite number of places than calculating sn and taking its repeated square root . 
 The double @-@ exponential growth of the Sylvester sequence is unsurprising if one compares it to the sequence of Fermat numbers Fn ; the Fermat numbers are usually defined by a doubly exponential formula , <formula> , but they can also be defined by a product formula very similar to that defining Sylvester 's sequence : 
 <formula> 
 = = Connection with Egyptian fractions = = 
 The unit fractions formed by the reciprocals of the values in Sylvester 's sequence generate an infinite series : 
 <formula> 
 The partial sums of this series have a simple form , 
 <formula> 
 This may be proved by induction , or more directly by noting that the recursion implies that 
 <formula> 
 so the sum telescopes 
 <formula> 
 Since this sequence of partial sums ( sj @-@ 2 ) / ( sj @-@ 1 ) converges to one , the overall series forms an infinite Egyptian fraction representation of the number one : 
 <formula> 
 One can find finite Egyptian fraction representations of one , of any length , by truncating this series and subtracting one from the last denominator : 
 <formula> 
 The sum of the first k terms of the infinite series provides the closest possible underestimate of 1 by any k @-@ term Egyptian fraction . For example , the first four terms add to 1805 / 1806 , and therefore any Egyptian fraction for a number in the open interval ( 1805 / 1806 @,@ 1 ) requires at least five terms . 
 It is possible to interpret the Sylvester sequence as the result of a greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions , that at each step chooses the smallest possible denominator that makes the partial sum of the series be less than one . Alternatively , the terms of the sequence after the first can be viewed as the denominators of the odd greedy expansion of 1 / 2 . 
 = = Uniqueness of quickly growing series with rational sums = = 
 As Sylvester himself observed , Sylvester 's sequence seems to be unique in having such quickly growing values , while simultaneously having a series of reciprocals that converges to a rational number . This sequence provides an example showing that double @-@ exponential growth is not enough to cause an integer sequence to be an irrationality sequence . 
 To make this more precise , it follows from results of Badea ( 1993 ) that , if a sequence of integers <formula> grows quickly enough that 
 <formula> 
 and if the series 
 <formula> 
 converges to a rational number A , then , for all n after some point , this sequence must be defined by the same recurrence 
 <formula> 
 that can be used to define Sylvester 's sequence . 
 Erdős & Graham ( 1980 ) conjectured that , in results of this type , the inequality bounding the growth of the sequence could be replaced by a weaker condition , 
 <formula> 
 Badea ( 1995 ) surveys progress related to this conjecture ; see also Brown ( 1979 ) . 
 = = <unk> and factorizations = = 
 If i < j , it follows from the definition that sj ≡ 1 ( mod si ) . Therefore , every two numbers in Sylvester 's sequence are relatively prime . The sequence can be used to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers , as any prime can divide at most one number in the sequence . More strongly , no prime factor of a number in the sequence can be congruent to 5 ( mod 6 ) , and the sequence can be used to prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 ( mod 12 ) . 
 Much remains unknown about the factorization of the numbers in the Sylvester 's sequence . For instance , it is not known if all numbers in the sequence are <unk> , although all the known terms are . 
 As <unk> ( 1991 ) describes , it is easy to determine which Sylvester number ( if any ) a given prime p divides : simply compute the recurrence defining the numbers modulo p until finding either a number that is congruent to zero ( mod p ) or finding a repeated modulus . Via this technique he found that 1166 out of the first three million primes are divisors of Sylvester numbers , and that none of these primes has a square that divides a Sylvester number . The set of primes which can occur as factors of Sylvester numbers is of density zero in the set of all primes : indeed , the number of such primes less than x is <formula> . 
 The following table shows known factorizations of these numbers , ( except the first four , which are all prime ) : 
 As is customary , Pn and Cn denote prime and composite numbers n digits long . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Boyer , <unk> & <unk> ( 2005 ) use the properties of Sylvester 's sequence to define large numbers of Sasakian Einstein manifolds having the differential topology of odd @-@ dimensional spheres or exotic spheres . They show that the number of distinct Sasakian Einstein metrics on a topological sphere of dimension 2n − 1 is at least proportional to sn and hence has double exponential growth with n . 
 As <unk> & <unk> ( 1995 ) describe , Brown ( 1979 ) and Liang ( 1980 ) used values derived from Sylvester 's sequence to construct lower bound examples for online bin packing algorithms . <unk> & <unk> ( 2005 ) similarly use the sequence to lower bound the performance of a two @-@ dimensional cutting stock algorithm . 
 Znám 's problem concerns sets of numbers such that each number in the set divides but is not equal to the product of all the other numbers , plus one . Without the inequality requirement , the values in Sylvester 's sequence would solve the problem ; with that requirement , it has other solutions derived from recurrences similar to the one defining Sylvester 's sequence . Solutions to Znám 's problem have applications to the classification of surface singularities ( Brenton and Hill 1988 ) and to the theory of nondeterministic finite automata . 
 D. R. Curtiss ( 1922 ) describes an application of the closest approximations to one by k @-@ term sums of unit fractions , in lower @-@ bounding the number of divisors of any perfect number , and Miller ( 1919 ) uses the same property to lower bound the size of certain groups .

 The film begins where its predecessor ended , with reigning don Shoaib Khan ( Akshay Kumar ) earning respect after assassinating his mentor , Sultan Mirza ( Ajay Devgn ) . Twelve years later he is still a charismatic , suave womaniser , who has extended his empire to the Mideast . Khan 's only friends are Javed ( Sarfaraz Khan ) ( who oversees his illegal work ) , his former love Mumtaz ( Sonali Bendre ) , and Aslam ( Imran Khan ) , a teenager Khan met during a visit to the slums in which he grew up . 
 An older Khan returns to Bombay to kill Rawal ( Mahesh Manjrekar ) , who opposed his ambition to take the reins in Bombay . Although the city was his first love , rising starlet Jasmine ( Sonakshi Sinha ) wins his heart . Khan advances Jasmine 's career by rigging awards , and showers her with gifts ; he becomes obsessed with her . He sends Aslam and another trustworthy aide , Jimmy , to kill Rawal . Jimmy fails , accidentally killing his girlfriend , Sonia , and flees . He is soon captured by the police , hot on Khan 's trail after learning about his arrival in Bombay . Jimmy , loyal to Khan , does not crack during his interrogation and is freed due to lack of evidence . The police intend to draw Khan out from hiding ; he has eluded them for twelve years , and this is their last chance to take him on Indian soil . 
 Khan , suspicious that Jimmy has become a police informer , decides to kill him but Aslam offers to do the deed to deflect police attention . He , Dedh Tang and several thugs masquerade as rival biker gangs and stage a brawl . <unk> police officers try to control the chaos when Aslam corners Jimmy . When a police officer stops Aslam , Khan appears out of nowhere , murders Jimmy and injures the policeman . A chase ensues ; the police fail to catch the two , who escape in Khan 's Mercedes . 
 Although Khan has bought Jasmine a house , she rejects his advances , saying that she has never seen him as being more than a friend . Angry and disappointed , Khan slaps her and tells her to leave . He angrily destroys the set of the film she is cast in , leaving with her a twenty @-@ four @-@ hour deadline to accept his proposal . Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents . Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she 'd prefer not to associate . Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan . 
 Later in the night , Jasmine meets Aslam at his uncle 's restaurant . He tries to explain his love for her , only to be interrupted and told that she is engaged and the two should stop seeing one another . Dejected and disappointed , Aslam meets with Khan , who seems unusually pensive . The two lament their relationships , not knowing they are both in love with the same woman . Just before Aslam is about to reveal the name of his romantic interest , a phone rings - Khan , jubilant , announces that his proposal has been accepted and orders Aslam to pick up his new " <unk> , " or sister @-@ in @-@ law . 
 Aslam arrives at the address Khan has given him and , much to his shock , sees Jasmine walking towards his car .

Before either can speak , a car containing Rawal and his henchmen arrives at a distance . Rawal shoots Jasmine , having learned of her relationship with Khan and hoping that hurting her lure the gangster into a vulnerable position . 
 Jasmine remains unconscious at the hospital as Khan arrives . He accuses Aslam of being in love with his fiancée - an accusation which Aslam denies as Khan reveals that he has masterminded a plan to murder Rawal and ensure his own dominance over the Mumbai underworld . Khan intends to fabricate a story of him feuding with Aslam to tempt Rawal and his rivals into contacting Aslam . The " news " reaches Rawal , who seems delighted at the prospect of being able to turn Khan 's right @-@ hand man against him . 
 When Rawal calls Aslam at the hospital , Aslam , now fully aware of Khan 's feelings towards Jasmine , seems unsure whether to abide by Khan 's plan . He reluctantly provides Rawal with an address , ending the phone call by telling him to " murder the bastard . " Khan , lying in wait outside the address with a sniper rifle , kills Rawal and his henchmen when they arrive . Khan , having consolidated power , <unk> his victory and walks into a police station as a taunt to law enforcement . However , Dedh Tang accidentally reveals Aslam 's love for Jasmine in the midst of celebration . Khan , infuriated , diverts the car to the hospital to confront Aslam , who has continued to stay with Jasmine as she recovers from being shot by Rawal . Knowing that his friend is in danger , Dedh Tang <unk> the horn of the car repeatedly after Shoaib and his henchmen enter the building , alerting Aslam to the danger and giving him time to escape . Entering to see an empty bed where Jasmine had before been laying , Khan realizes that Dedh Tang had given him away . 
 Khan sends his aide Akbar to kill Aslam after he and Jasmine flee to Aslam 's uncle 's restaurant in Dongri . Aslam assures Jasmine that Khan , though violent , would never hurt him . Their conversation is interrupted by a car 's horn honking - running outside , Aslam is ambushed by Akbar after discovering the body of Dedh Tang , who has been killed by Shoaib for aiding the couple in their escape . Aslam , though injured and initially losing the fight , kills Akbar with a shovel . He calls Khan to tell him that the murder of Dedh Tang has , in effect , erased his deep @-@ seated loyalty to his former boss . Khan responds by telling Aslam that sending Akbar was a mistake , as he must be the one to kill the man he views as also having betrayed him by " stealing " Jasmine . 
 Aslam and Khan confront one another as the police , having been alerted to Khan 's location by a storekeeper , descend upon Dongri . Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam , urging him to defend himself in front of Jasmine . Nevertheless , Aslam , who still feels indebted and bound to Khan , does not fight back until Inspector <unk> appears through the gathered crowd - even then , Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer . Reacting quickly , Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots <unk> before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam . Jasmine , through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam , tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love . Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple . Just then , more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan , who , now injured , is dragged away by one of his henchmen . He and Aslam , both alive but bloodied , lock eyes and reach out for another , having finally put aside their differences . 
 In the last scene , a bullet @-@ ridden , dejected Khan reads a letter he was unable to give Jasmine in the cargo hold of a ship .

 <unk> Garg , CEO of Balaji Motion Pictures , announced on Twitter that principal photography began on 27 August 2012 in Mumbai . Female lead Sonakshi Sinha joined the cast and crew two days later after completing her previous film , Son of Sardaar , with Ajay Devgn . The overseas shooting schedule began in September in Oman , the first major Indian production filmed in the sultanate . Portions of the film were shot on a beach in <unk> , on the corniche in <unk> , and at the Shangri @-@ La 's Barr Al Jissah Resort & Spa in Muscat . When director Milan Luthria became ill with a virus , shooting was postponed for three days . To make up the lost time Luthria persuaded Kumar to work on two consecutive Sundays , the first time he had worked on a Sunday since Priyadarshan 's 2006 <unk> <unk> . The remainder of the film was shot on location in Khala , on the Sassoon Docks and at Mukesh Mills in Mumbai . The shoot was wrapped up by January 2013 .

 The film 's visual effects ( VFX ) were by Reliance MediaWorks , which also produced computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) for Balaji Motion Pictures and Luthria for its prequel , Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai ( 2010 ) . Since the company was also generating VFX for the yet @-@ unreleased Chennai Express ( 2013 ) its roster of animators and compositors was divided into two teams . The Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara ! team consisted of 40 artists , who augmented 600 digital shots in one month . Luthria informed the company that Dobaara ! was set during the 1980s , with car chases requiring visual effects . About 25 percent were shot against chroma key backgrounds , since they would have been difficult to film otherwise . Scenes in the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in the United Arab Emirates were recreated three @-@ dimensionally with polygonal modelling in Autodesk Maya instead of the live @-@ action plates used for shots in Muscat . Adobe Photoshop and ZBrush were used to add texture to matte paintings in the background and the 3D models . Outdoor shots in Mumbai ( such as Colaba Causeway and Ballard Pier ) were replaced by interior and exterior live @-@ action plates from Oman . According to Sanjiv Naik , the film 's VFX supervisor , the last few scenes were the most difficult ones to shoot . In the last scene where Khan is lying wounded in the cargo hold of a ship , the camera zooms out to reveal the word Mumbai . The VFX shot was captured in 2 @,@ 000 frames which took 15 days to complete , with the camera panning out only 30 feet in reality . Except for the interior shot of Kumar , the remaining shots were digital . The live action was filmed with RED and Arri 's Alexa digital motion @-@ picture camera .

 Emraan Hashmi , who appeared in the original film , was initially chosen to play the lead role . However , Luthria was looking for an older actor and chose Kumar for the role of Shoaib Khan ( based on Dawood Ibrahim ) . In February 2012 it was announced that there were two male leads in the film , the second said to be Shahid Kapoor , but the following month Imran Khan was confirmed as the second male lead . Many actresses were considered for the female lead , including Illeana D 'Cruz , Kareena Kapoor , Kangana Ranaut , Asin <unk> , Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone , but in April it was reported that Sonakshi Sinha had been cast . Sonali Bendre was also signed as a lead character in the film . The film marked Bendre 's first role since Shankar Dada MBBS . Bendre did not charge her fees for the film owing to the fact that <unk> Kapoor , one of the producers of the film has been the friend of her Mother @-@ in @-@ law for the past 40 years also out of gratitude for Luthria , who shot her first song <unk> hai Maine in the 1994 film <unk> . In November 2012 , it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on Eid 2013 . TV actor Chetan Hansraj was signed as an antagonist in the film . Kumar revealed during the trailer launch of the film about having no aspirations to set new benchmarks on a role previously enacted by Hashmi . Khan in preparation for his role in the film drew inspiration from Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor , copying their mannerisms , behaviour and dressing style by watching DVD 's of films starring them produced in the 1980s . Back in those days copying mannerism of film stars drew appreciation from peers .

 Akshay Kumar played a fictitious gangster based on Dawood Ibrahim . Kumar 's character 's look was revealed on a reality show on <unk> Colors . Kumar 's entrance on the show was supposed to be accompanied by music after a scene from the prequel ( choreographed by director Milan Luthria ) , followed by an action sequence . The scene had a " minor glitch " , believed to be a failed attempt to sabotage Kumar 's entrance . The scene was performed twice , taking a toll on Kumar 's back and leading to the cancellation of a public appearance . The film would reportedly feature a scene with Kumar watching a cricket match , but whether the match was between India and Pakistan at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium during the 1980s was unconfirmed . The trailer premiered in Mumbai , where many of the film 's outdoor scenes were shot . To promote the film , Kumar flew from New York ( where he was on holiday with his family ) to Birmingham to watch the India @-@ Pakistan ICC Champions Trophy match on 15 June 2013 at Edgbaston Cricket Ground . A second trailer of the film was released on 3 July 2013 , with narration by Kumar 's character ( Shoaib Khan ) , revealing plot details such as the rivalry between Kumar 's and Imran Khan 's characters for Jasmine 's love . The trailer described Khan as the film 's antihero , featuring action sequences between Shoaib Khan and Aslam ( Imran Khan ) . Mohar Basu of Koimoi praised the second trailer , its background score , direction and action choreography , saying it " is even better than the film 's first trailer " and has " an explosive impact on its audiences " . 
 Producer Ekta Kapoor promoted the film 's second trailer , buying prime @-@ time ( 8 to 11 pm ) slots on four television channels . She also spent 20 million rupees for a slot on a leading channel for a promotion for the film . <unk> Kumar , Sonakshi Sinha and Imran Khan ( the three leads ) promoted the film on Comedy Nights with Kapil , hosted by Kapil Sharma . Kumar , Sinha , Khan , Kapoor and most of the other cast and crew visited the Dargah Sharif ( a shrine to the Sufi saint <unk> Chishti in Ajmer ) on Monday morning , 5 August , to pray for the film 's success and the well @-@ being of all involved . 
 Hollywood actor Al Pacino enjoyed the film 's promotion , saying that the promos and posters reminded him of The Godfather when business associate Barry <unk> showed him the theatrical trailer ( Pacino portrayed Michael Corleone , son of Vito Corleone ) . Akshay Kumar said of Pacino 's response : " A touch of appreciation is always held dearly in an actor 's arms , even if it 's from the simplest of people like our beloved spot boys . But to have your work spoken of so kindly by the world 's most admired gangster Al Pacino himself – I had goose @-@ bumps thinking about him watching the promo ! I was so humbled , not only as an actor but as a fan of his legendary work . I pray he enjoys the final piece as much as he enjoyed the promo ! " Actor Rishi Kapoor , on whom the original version of the song Tayyab Ali was <unk> in Amar Akbar Anthony , praised Imran Khan 's performance and the song after an impromptu meeting with Khan ( who was concerned about comparisons between the versions ) during a dubbing session for the film . 
 The film 's title has been changed several times . The media first referred to the production as Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai 2 , although it was earlier officially known as Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Again . Due to the producer 's beliefs in astrology and numerology , the film was renamed Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Dobara ( " again " in Hindi ) . A " y " and an extra " a " were added , making it Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara ! ( the present title ) . 
 It was promoted at the unveiling of a line of LED televisions by manufacturer Arise India with appearances by Kumar , Sinha , Khan and Kapoor . In addition to visiting the Dargah Sharif and the Balaji shrine in South India to pray for the success of her films before their release , Kapoor fasted during <unk> for the film 's success and planned visits to Mumbai 's Mohamed Ali Road to celebrate <unk> and feed the poor . 
 Chennai Express and Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara ! were originally not scheduled for release by Pakistani distributors and exhibitors , but deals were finalised to release both films in Pakistan .

Rajiv <unk> of Bollywood Hungama said that " the soundtrack has only four songs but nevertheless emerges as one of the better albums of this year " praising the first three tracks identifying Tu Hi <unk> and <unk> as the finest and weakest links of the album respectively . Bryan Durham of The Times of India said that " brevity seems to be the soul of the Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Dobaara soundtrack " , highlighting Yeh Tune Kya Kiya as the best song .

 The film which at the beginning was scheduled to be released on Eid , 8 August 2013 was pushed back to 15 August 2013 , to avoid clashing with Rohit Shetty 's directorial venture , Chennai Express starring Shah Rukh Khan .

 Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara ! received mixed @-@ to @-@ negative reviews . Anupama Chopra gave the film three out of five stars in The Hindustan Times : " Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbaai Dobaara ! had me cheering for the bad guy . Which , at least in the movies , is never a bad thing . The film gets one extra star for Akshay Kumar , who makes a stellar killer " . Madhureeta Mukherjee awarded the film 3 @.@ 5 out of five stars in The Times of India , telling readers to watch the film only for its flattering dons and their heroines , saying " there 's nothing criminal about it ! " She praised Milan Luthria for capturing the essence of the film 's setting and Kumar 's portrayal of Shoaib Khan : " Bhai act with flamboyance and mojo ... He gets a chance to do what he does best – <unk> ( albeit less menacing , more entertaining ) , with charisma and clap @-@ trap <unk> " but criticised Imran Khan 's " ill @-@ at @-@ ease " rogue , the second half of the film for being " at times too overbearing " and said , " this film has its moments , but it 's not as compelling as the prequel . " Vinayak <unk> gave the film two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars in India Today : " OUATIMD should remind Bollywood what we all always knew : Never make a sequel just for the heck of it if you don 't have a genuine idea to entertain " . Subhash K. Jha termed the film as " one of the most ill @-@ timed gangster dramas " criticising the acting of all the three leads , praising only the short cameo of Sonali Bendre . 
 The film drew a number of negative reactions from the film critics . <unk> Gupta gave the film a half @-@ star out of five in The Indian Express , saying " After all the shoot @-@ outs and bang @-@ bangs are over , you are left with a film which leaves you with so little new that you wonder if there 's any juice left in this style of retro gangsta flick .

" Rajeev Masand of CNN @-@ IBN gave the film 1 @.@ 5 out of five stars , describing the film as the " equivalent of getting a root canal " .

 Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara ! and its prequel Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai have been described as having a storyline and characters similar to the life of Dawood Ibrahim .

 In 1994 , Beghe was in an acting class taught by Scientologist Milton Katselas , and decided to take some Scientology courses . Fellow acting student Bodhi Elfman gave him a book about Scientology from which Beghe was introduced to the idea that " technology " developed by L. Ron Hubbard could yield superhuman abilities . Beghe helped promote a " What is Scientology ? " exhibition which was part of a Church of Scientology national television advertising campaign in Britain in 1999 . He appeared in Scientology promotional videos in 2005 .

 After leaving Scientology , Beghe contacted Andreas Heldal @-@ Lund , founder of Operation Clambake , who convinced him to meet with journalist and Scientology critic Mark Bunker . Heldal @-@ Lund and Bunker went to Beghe 's house , where Beghe participated in an interview about his experiences as a Scientologist . Bunker published a three @-@ minute portion of the three @-@ hour interview to YouTube in mid @-@ April 2008 , and in the video Beghe calls Scientology " very dangerous for your spiritual , psychological , mental , emotional health and evolution . " The interview closes with Beghe stating , " I don 't have an agenda . I 'm just trying to help . [ ... ] I have the luxury of having gotten into Scientology and after having been in it , been out . And that 's a perspective that people who are still in and not out do not have . " 
 When asked in an interview in The Village Voice if he thought his public criticism of Scientology would hurt his acting career , Beghe joked , " I ’ m probably not going to be doing any movies for United Artists any time soon . " ( United Artists was revamped as a joint venture with Scientologist Tom Cruise , his business associate Paula Wagner , who is chief executive of the company , and Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer . ) Marina Hyde of The Guardian called Beghe a Scientology celebrity whistleblower . 
 The video was taken down from YouTube on April 17 , 2008 but was reposted by multiple other YouTube users shortly thereafter . By April 18 , 2008 , at least 45 users had reposted the video interview using their own YouTube accounts . Bunker 's account was also canceled on April 17 , and he believed this was due to copyright issues stemming from clips of The Colbert Report that he had uploaded to YouTube . Although the issues have since been resolved , Bunker initially thought that his account had been banned and the video made inaccessible due to pressure on YouTube staff from the Church of Scientology ; claims which were not confirmed or denied by YouTube representative Ricardo Reyes , who referred to YouTube 's policy of not commenting on individual videos . On April 21 , 2008 Mark Bunker posted the video footage of the entire interview with Jason Beghe ; as Bunker 's YouTube account was suspended , the full interview footage was instead hosted on Vimeo and <unk> 
 On April 28 , 2008 , Beghe posted online a letter to Church leader David Miscavige , requesting the confidential confessional files that Scientology compiles during Auditing sessions . In a message posted to the Operation Clambake website , Beghe wrote : " As the Church of Scientology carefully monitors all anti @-@ scientology websites , I am posting the letter here , on xenu.net , to assure that it be received by the C of S. " He had previously contacted the President 's Office at The Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International who " refused to directly respond " to his request , and a letter to David Miscavige sent through the Church communication system was also refused . Beghe told The Village Voice that these confidential files are also kept on actor Tom Cruise as well as other celebrity Scientologists . " More people have left Scientology than are currently in it . And yet they maintain these files about what people have said to them in private sessions . Why would you want these people to hold onto this stuff ? " said Beghe to The Village Voice . Beghe believes that Scientology 's practice of disconnection is still in place , and in an interview with Tony Ortega of The Village Voice cited his four @-@ year @-@ old son being kicked out of a Scientology school as an example of disconnection . 
 A portion of Beghe 's criticism of Scientology originally uploaded to YouTube by Mark Bunker was shown on Nightline in a piece about David Miscavige 's niece , Jenna Miscavige Hill , and her criticism of Scientology . Beghe has turned down television appearances to speak about his experiences , stating : " I just wanted to make sure that the story isn ’ t about me . It ’ s not about me . It ’ s about helping others who are still lost in the cult , or toying with the idea of getting involved . " 
 On May 29 , 2008 , Beghe attended a protest against the Church of Scientology held outside the Scientology building on East 46th Street in New York City . He addressed the 50 protesters gathered across the street from the Scientology building , and told them : " What you guys are doing means so much to me , and so much to these people ... It just kills me . It makes me want to cry . You don ’ t know what kind of good you ’ re doing . " He then walked across the street in an attempt to enter the Scientology building , but was prevented from entering by three hired private security guards . He returned to the group of protesters and tried to phone the president of the Church of Scientology of New York , John Carmichael : " I called and asked for John Carmichael and said I was Jason Beghe . Then they hung up . " 
 In September 2008 , Beghe traveled to Europe where he spoke with government officials in Hamburg , Germany about his experiences as a Scientologist . He had been invited by Germany ’ s Department of Interior Affairs to speak at a panel organized by Ursula <unk> on Scientology titled : " That is Scientology ! Reports from the USA " . Beghe suggested that governments put up a warning sign , similar to warnings placed on packs of cigarettes , and the next day a member of Germany 's Interior Department told him such a sign was placed outside a Church of Scientology building in Berlin . Beghe said that Scientology hired private investigators to follow him to Europe . 
 Beghe was a guest in May 2009 on the BBC World Service radio program World : Have Your Say , where he discussed his views on what he thought of Scientology when he first joined : " I thought that it was something that was going to deliver miracles , and that it was the most selfless group of people that were totally dedicated to helping mankind , and I wanted to be part of it . " He was also critical of the Scientology organization leadership , including its head David Miscavige : " I think that there are probably things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people - my main issue is not with Scientology per se , it is with Scientology the organization - it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor , and that has to do with people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige ... " 
 In September 2010 , Beghe took part in a BBC News Panorama documentary , The Secrets of Scientology , in which he spoke about his decision to leave the organization . He said his time with the organization had cost him " a million dollars " and hinted that the religion was a racket . Beghe also appeared in the 2015 HBO documentary Going Clear , based upon the book of the same name by Lawrence Wright .

 State Route 903 ( SR 903 ) is a 10 @.@ 06 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 16 @.@ 19 km ) state highway located entirely in Kittitas County , Washington , United States . The highway links Lake Cle Elum to Roslyn , Cle Elum and SR 970 , which provides access to Interstate 90 . The highway has existed as a numbered highway since at least 1939 , however a highway linking Lake Cle Elum to Cle Elum has existed since 1897 . The Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) had previously considered turning control of the highway over to Kittitas County , however this never happened , and WSDOT continues to maintain the highway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 903 begins at an intersection with SR 970 just north of the Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) / SR 970 interchange , headed westerly into the town of Cle Elum . Before entering Cle Elum , the highway intersects its spur route , SR 903 Spur , which serves as a bypass for travelers on SR 970 who wish to avoid the main interchange of SR 903 . The roadway parallels a railroad line before it terminates in South Cle Elum . The highway jogs to the north for a block before turning back west along Second Street , exiting the town and turning northwesterly . SR 903 continues through a roundabout before entering the town of Roslyn . The highway continues through town , turning southwesterly on Nevada Street , before turning back northwesterly at Seventh Street , exiting Roslyn . The highway continues through Ronald before terminating at the boundary of the Wenatchee National Forest , east of Cle Elum Lake . The roadway continues northerly however as Salmon La Sac Road . 
 The Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) measures traffic counts , measured in terms of annual average daily traffic , with as few as 1 @,@ 100 cars at the northern terminus , and as many as 7 @,@ 400 cars just past the intersection at Pennsylvania Avenue in Roslyn .

 The current highway was numbered Secondary State Highway 2E ( SSH 2E ) since at least 1939 , though maps show a roadway following roughly the same alignment in existence since at least 1897 . During the 1964 state highway renumbering , the designation was changed from SSH 2E to SR 903 . WSDOT was considering dropping SR 903 from the state highway system and turning over the highway to Kittitas County in 1992 ; however , the idea was quickly dropped . The roundabout at Bullfrog was first proposed in 2002 , and was estimated to cost $ 1 @.@ 2 million , paid for by <unk> Resort . The roundabout opened to traffic sometime between May 7 and July 15 , 2005 .

 Jagadguru Rambhadracharya was born to Pandit <unk> Mishra and <unk> Mishra in a <unk> Brahmin family of the <unk> Gotra ( lineage of the sage <unk> ) in <unk> village in the Jaunpur district , Uttar Pradesh , India . He was born on 14 January 1950 . Born to mother <unk> and father Pandit <unk> Mishra , he was named Giridhar by his great aunt , a paternal cousin of his paternal grandfather , Pandit <unk> Mishra . The great aunt was a devotee of <unk> , a female saint of the Bhakti era in medieval India , who used the name Giridhar to address the god Krishna in her compositions . 
 = = = Loss of eyesight = = = 
 Giridhar lost his eyesight at the age of two months . On 24 March 1950 , his eyes were infected by trachoma . There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village , so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief . The woman applied a paste of <unk> to Giridhar 's eyes to burst the lumps , but his eyes started bleeding , resulting in the loss of his eyesight . His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow , where his eyes were treated for 21 days , but his sight could not be restored . Various Ayurvedic , Homeopathic , <unk> , and other practitioners were approached in <unk> , Lucknow , and Bombay , but to no avail . Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since . He cannot read or write , as he does not use Braille ; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes . 
 = = = Childhood accident = = = 
 In June 1953 , at a juggler 's monkey dance show in the village , the children — including Giridhar — suddenly ran away when the monkey began to touch them . Giridhar fell into a small dry well and was trapped for some time , until a teenage girl rescued him . His grandfather told him that his life was saved because he had learned the following line of a verse in the Ramcharitmanas ( 1 @.@ 192 @.@ 4 ) , from the episode of the manifestation of the god Rama : 
 Those who sing this lay attain to the feet of Hari ( Vishnu ) and never fall into the well of birth and death . 
 Giridhar 's grandfather asked him to recite the verse always , and from then on , Giridhar has followed the practice of reciting it every time he takes water or food . 
 = = = First composition = = = 
 Giridhar 's initial education came from his paternal grandfather , as his father worked in Bombay . In the afternoons , his grandfather would narrate to him various episodes of the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata , and devotional works like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . At the age of three , Giridhar composed his first piece of poetry — in Awadhi ( a dialect of Hindi ) — and recited it to his grandfather . In this verse , Krishna 's foster mother Yashoda is fighting with a Gopi ( milkmaid ) for hurting Krishna . 
 = = = Mastering Gita and Ramcharitmanas = = = 
 At the age of five , Giridhar memorised the entire Bhagavad Gita , consisting of around 700 verses with chapter and verse numbers , in 15 days , with the help of his neighbour , Pandit <unk> Mishra . On Janmashtami day in 1955 , he recited the entire Bhagavad Gita . He released the first Braille version of the scripture , with the original Sanskrit text and a Hindi commentary , at New Delhi on 30 November 2007 , 52 years after memorising the Gita . When Giridhar was seven , he memorised the entire Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas , consisting of around 10 @,@ 900 verses with chapter and verse numbers , in 60 days , assisted by his grandfather . On Rama Navami day in 1957 , he recited the entire epic while fasting . Later , Giridhar went on to memorise the Vedas , the Upanishads , works of Sanskrit grammar , the Bhagavata Purana , all the works of Tulsidas , and many other works in Sanskrit and Indian literature . 
 = = = Upanayana and Katha discourses = = = 
 Giridhar 's Upanayana ( sacred thread ceremony ) was performed on <unk> Ekadashi ( the Ekadashi falling in the bright half of the lunar month of <unk> ) of 24 June 1961 . On this day , besides being given the Gayatri Mantra , he was initiated ( given Diksha ) into the mantra of Rama by Pandit <unk> Maharaj of Ayodhya . Having mastered the Bhagavad Gita and Ramcharitmanas at a very young age , Giridhar started visiting the Katha programmes held near his village once every three years in the intercalary month of Purushottama . The third time he attended , he presented a Katha on Ramcharitmanas , which was acclaimed by several famous exponents of the Katha art . 
 = = = Discrimination by family = = = 
 When Giridhar was eleven , he was stopped from joining his family in a wedding procession . His family thought that his presence would be a bad omen for the marriage . This incident left a strong impression on Giridhar ; he says at the beginning of his autobiography : 
 I am the same person who was considered to be inauspicious for accompanying a marriage party . ... I am the same person who currently inaugurates the biggest of marriage parties or welfare ceremonies . What is all this ? It is all due to the grace of God which turns a straw into a vajra and a vajra into a straw .

 = = = Schooling = = = 
 Although Giridhar did not have any formal schooling till the age of seventeen years , he had learned many literary works as a child by listening to them . His family wished him to become a <unk> ( a Katha artist ) but Giridhar wanted to pursue his studies . His father explored possibilities for his education in Varanasi and thought of sending him to a special school for blind students . Giridhar 's mother refused to send him there , saying that blind children were not treated well at the school . On 7 July 1967 Giridhar joined the Adarsh <unk> Sanskrit College in the nearby <unk> village of Jaunpur to study Sanskrit Vyakarana ( grammar ) , Hindi , English , Maths , History , and Geography . In his autobiography he recalls this day as the day when the " Golden Journey " of his life began . With an ability to memorise material by listening to it just once , Giridhar has not used Braille or other aids to study . In three months , he had memorised and mastered the entire <unk> of Varadaraja . He was top of his class for four years , and passed the Uttara <unk> ( higher secondary ) examination in Sanskrit with first class and distinction . 
 First Sanskrit composition 
 At the Adarsh <unk> Sanskrit College , Giridhar learnt the eight Ganas of Sanskrit prosody while studying <unk> , a work on Sanskrit prosody . The next day , he composed his first Sanskrit verse , in the <unk> metre .

 In 1971 Giridhar enrolled at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi for higher studies in Vyakarana . He topped the final examination for the Shastri ( Bachelor of Arts ) degree in 1974 , and then enrolled for the Acharya ( Master of Arts ) degree at the same institute . While pursuing his master 's degree , he visited New Delhi to participate in various national competitions at the All @-@ India Sanskrit Conference , where he won five out of the eight gold medals — in Vyakarana , Samkhya , Nyaya , Vedanta , and Sanskrit <unk> . Indira Gandhi , then Prime Minister of India , presented the five gold medals , along with the <unk> trophy for Uttar Pradesh , to Giridhar . Impressed by his abilities , Gandhi offered to send him at her own expense to the United States for treatment for his eyes , but Giridhar turned down this offer , replying with an extemporaneous Sanskrit verse . 
 In 1976 Giridhar topped the final Acharya examinations in Vyakarana , winning seven gold medals and the Chancellor 's gold medal . In a rare achievement , although he had only enrolled for a master 's degree in Vyakarana , he was declared Acharya of all subjects taught at the university on 30 April 1976 .

 After completing his master 's degree , Giridhar enrolled for the doctoral <unk> ( PhD ) degree at the same institute , under Pandit Ramprasad Tripathi . He received a research fellowship from the University Grants Commission ( UGC ) , but even so , he faced financial hardship during the next five years . He completed his <unk> degree in Sanskrit grammar on 14 October 1981 . His dissertation was titled <unk> <unk> <unk> , or Deliberation on the non @-@ <unk> usages in the Adhyatma Ramayana . The thesis was authored in only thirteen days in 1981 . On completion of his doctorate , the UGC offered him the position of head of the Vyakarana department of the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University . However , Giridhar did not accept ; he decided to devote his life to the service of religion , society , and the disabled . 
 On 9 May 1997 , Giridhar ( now known as Rambhadracharya ) was awarded the post @-@ doctorate <unk> ( DLitt ) degree by Sampurnanand Sanskrit University for his 2000 @-@ page Sanskrit dissertation <unk> <unk> <unk> , or Investigation into verbal knowledge of every Sūtra of the Ashtadhyayi of Panini .

 Virakta Diksha 
 In 1976 Giridhar narrated a Katha on Ramcharitmanas to Swami <unk> , who advised him not to marry , to stay a lifelong Brahmachari ( celibate bachelor ) and to take initiation in a Vaishnava Sampradaya ( a sect worshipping Vishnu , Krishna , or Rama as the supreme God ) . Giridhar took <unk> ( renouncer ) initiation or Virakta Diksha in the Ramananda Sampradaya on the Kartika full @-@ moon day of 19 November 1983 from Shri <unk> Maharaj <unk> . He now came to be known as Rambhadradas . 
 Six @-@ month fasts 
 Following the fifth verse of the Dohavali composed by Tulsidas , Rambhadradas observed a six @-@ month Payovrata , a diet of only milk and fruits , at Chitrakoot in 1979 . 
 In 1983 he observed his second Payovrata beside the <unk> <unk> in Chitrakoot . The Payovrata has become a regular part of Rambhadradas ' life . In 2002 , in his sixth Payovrata , he composed the Sanskrit epic Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam . He continues to observe <unk> , the latest ( 2010 – 2011 ) being his ninth . 
 Tulsi Peeth 
 In 1987 Rambhadradas established a religious and social service institution called Tulsi Peeth ( The seat of Tulsi ) in Chitrakoot , where , according to the Ramayana , Rama had spent twelve out of his fourteen years of exile . As the founder of the seat , the title of <unk> ( literally , the Lord of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot ) was bestowed upon him by Sadhus and intellectuals . In the Tulsi Peeth , he arranged for a temple devoted to Rama and his consort Sita to be constructed , which is known as <unk> Mandir ( " glass temple " ) .

 In July 2003 Rambhadracharya deposed as an expert witness for religious matters ( <unk> 16 ) in Other Original Suit Number 5 of the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute case in the Allahabad High Court . Some portions of his affidavit and cross examination are quoted in the final judgement by the High Court . In his affidavit , he cited the ancient Hindu scriptures including the Ramayana , <unk> Upaniṣad , Skanda Purana , Yajurveda , Atharvaveda , and others describing Ayodhya as a city holy to Hindus and the birthplace of Rama . He cited verses from two works composed by Tulsidas which , in his opinion , are relevant to the dispute . The first citation consisted of eight verses from a work called <unk> <unk> , which describe the destruction of a temple and construction of a mosque at the disputed site in 1528 CE by Mughal ruler Babur , who had ordered General Mir <unk> to destroy the Rama temple , considered a symbol of worship by infidels . The second citation was a verse from a work called <unk> , which mentions a mosque . In his cross examination , he described in some detail the history of the Ramananda sect , its <unk> , rules regarding <unk> , formation and working of <unk> , and Tulsidas ' works . <unk> the possibility of the original temple being to the north of the disputed area , as pleaded by the pro @-@ mosque parties , he described the boundaries of the Janmabhoomi as mentioned in the Ayodhya Mahatmya section of Skanda Purana , which tallied with the present location of the disputed area , as noted by Justice Sudhir Agarwal . However , he stated that he had no knowledge of whether there was a Ram <unk> ( " Platform of Rama " ) outside the area that was locked from 1950 to 1985 and where the Chati <unk> Sthal was , nor whether the idols of Rama , his brother Lakshmana , and Sita were installed at Ram <unk> outside the Janmabhoomi temple .

He founded the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University , an institution of higher learning solely for disabled students , on 27 September 2001 in Chitrakoot . This is the first university in the world exclusively for the disabled . The university was created by an ordinance of the Uttar Pradesh Government , which was later passed as Uttar Pradesh State Act 32 ( 2001 ) by the Uttar Pradesh legislature .

According to the Government of Uttar Pradesh , the university is among the chief educational institutes for Information Technology and Electronics in the state . 
 Rambhadracharya also founded an organisation called Jagadguru Rambhadracharya <unk> Seva Sangh , headquartered in <unk> , Madhya Pradesh . Its goal is to create community awareness and initiate child development programmes in rural India . Its primary objective is to supplement the education programmes of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University by helping disabled children get a good education .

 = = = Critical edition of Ramcharitmanas = = = 
 The Ramcharitmanas was composed by Tulsidas in the late sixteenth century . It has been extremely popular in northern India over the last four hundred years , and is often referred to as the " Bible of northern India " by Western Indologists . Rambhadracharya produced a critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas , which was published as the Tulsi Peeth edition . Apart from the original text , for which Rambhadracharya has relied extensively on older manuscripts , there were differences in spelling , grammar , and prosodic conventions between the Tulsi Peeth edition and contemporary editions of the Ramcharitmanas . 
 In November 2009 , Rambhadracharya was accused of tampering with the epic , but the dispute died down after Rambhadracharya expressed his regret for any annoyance or pain caused by the publication . A writ petition was also filed against him but it was dismissed . This edition was published in 2005 by Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva <unk> .

 In November 2007 someone claiming to be an al @-@ Qaeda member sent Rambhadracharya a letter telling him and his disciples either to accept Islam or to be prepared to die . Police superintendent Kamal Singh Rathore said that this letter had been sent from Haridwar , that Rambhadracharya 's security arrangements had been increased and that an intensive investigation of the letter had been carried out . Gita Devi , secretary of JRHU , said that Rambhadracharya had been threatened by al @-@ Qaeda , as Ram Janmabhoomi <unk> president <unk> had been in the past . 
 In November 2014 , Rambhadracharya received another assassination threat with a demand of " terror tax " over JRHU operations .

 On 25 August 2013 , Rambhadracharya arrived at the Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport in Lucknow along with VHP leader Ashok <unk> . He was going to Ayodhya to take part in the 84 @-@ <unk> yatra , a 12 @-@ day religious yatra which was banned by the state government citing law and order reasons . It is alleged that the ban was due to opposition from Muslim organisations or vote @-@ bank politics . Rambhadracharya 's participation in the yatra was kept secret . Rambhadracharya was put under house arrest at the home of R C Mishra , his disciple and friend . 
 On 26 August 2013 , a local lawyer <unk> Agnihotri filed a habeas corpus petition in the Allahabad High Court 's Lucknow bench , on which judges <unk> Murtaza and D K <unk> passed the release order for Rambhadracharya , along with <unk> and Praveen <unk> . The petitioner 's advocate H S Jain said that even though Rambhadracharya and other leaders were arrested under the section 151 of the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code , which permits an arrest to prevent commission of cognisable offences , the custody period cannot exceed 24 hours unless any other section of the code or any other law is applicable . After his release , Rambhadracharya said that the government had creating misconceptions about the yatra . 
 Two days after the incident , Rambhadracharya was given Y @-@ category security cover by the Uttar Pradesh government since he had reported security threats . Hindustan Times reported that this grant could be a possible attempt to " build bridges with the sadhus after the Sunday showdown . " Government officials said that a high @-@ powered committee will decide on the continuation of the security cover . JRHU vice @-@ chancellor B Pandey said that Rambhadracharya met Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow and invited him to be the chief guest in a University function , and Yadav accepted the invitation . However , Yadav did not attend the function due to difficult circumstances , but sent the Energy Minister of State Vijay Mishra and Secondary Education Minister of State Vijay Bahadur Pal . Rambhadracharya was disappointed that Yadav could not " come for even 15 minutes for disabled children , " and said that he will have atone for this .

 Rewa Prasad Dwivedi writes in his Sanskrit poem dedicated to Rambhadracharya that he is an encyclopaedia of learning whose literature is like numerous <unk> rivers flowing out simultaneously , and in whose literary works Shiva and Parvati delight while performing Tandava and Lasya . 
 <unk> Kala Nath Shastry writes in his review of Rambhadracharya 's works that Rambhadracharya is an accomplished and eloquent poet who is the foremost among scholars and is also well @-@ versed in all scriptures , and who even talks in extemporaneously composed poetry with Sanskrit scholars , usually in <unk> metre . Rambhadracharya uses with great effect the <unk> style with Sanskrit adjectives in his speeches . Shastry recounts a use of a long sentence in the <unk> style at a speech in Jaipur in July 2003 by Rambhadracharya , in which one sentence with multiple adjectives lasted around seven minutes and was " replete with poetic beauty " . Shastry writes that among Sanskrit poets , only <unk> ( poet of <unk> ) has been described as having such wonderful command over Sanskrit as Rambhadracharya has . 
 Shastry critiqued the work Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam in the January 2003 issue of the Sanskrit monthly <unk> . Shastry writes that the work has poetic excellence , variety of meters and dexterity of language which has not been seen hitherto in Sanskrit epics . Shastry finds the twentieth canto of the epic to be an excellent illustration of Sanskrit poetry in Prakrit verses , a style which was pioneered by Shastry 's father . 
 Dr. <unk> Dikshit , Sanskrit scholar from Jabalpur , says that that Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam combines the styles of three previous Sanskrit epics – it has two leading characters like in <unk> 's <unk> , the poetic excellence and variety of prosodic metres is like in <unk> 's <unk> , while the length and extent of the work is like the <unk> of <unk> . 
 Shastry also critiqued the work <unk> , about which he says that it has many new usages ( <unk> ) not seen earlier in Sanskrit poetry . As per Shastry , new dimensions in Sanskrit literature are seen in the play Śrīrāghavābhyudayam where there are songs in the <unk> style , and <unk> which is an epic poem in the <unk> style of <unk> by Jayadeva . Dikshit writes that <unk> is a revival of the letter @-@ poem ( <unk> ) genre in Sanskrit after 2000 years , and is the first work in Sanskrit literature whose lead character is disabled . 
 Shastry says that rhyme ( <unk> ) is a distinguishing feature of Rambhadracharya 's Sanskrit poetry . Shastry notes that that another feature of Rambhadracharya 's works is the devotion to motherland and patriotism , which is most evident in the poetic work <unk> on the life of Chandrashekhar Azad . Shastry says that this strong feeling of love towards motherland is reminiscent of old Sanskrit literature including Prithvi Sukta of Atharva Veda , various Puranas including Bhagavata Purana , and also in the Sanskrit works of Swami <unk> , a former Jagadguru Ramanandacharya . Dikshit says that the nationalistic play Śrīrāghavābhyudayam establishes Rambhadracharya as a successful playwright at a young age . Dikshit praises the aesthetics of the work Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī saying that it represents all the six <unk> of Indian literature ( <unk> , Rasa , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , and that it is a unique work of Rambhadracharya when it comes to figures of speech . Dikshit says that this work places Rambhadracharya in the league of <unk> poets like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; but observes the distinction that while the works of all these poets are primarily in the <unk> Rasa , Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī is a work which has <unk> Rasa as the primary emotion , which is augmented by <unk> Rasa . 
 <unk> notes that in the poems of Rambhadracharya , the three poetical styles of <unk> ( secondary figurative sense with short and sweet @-@ sounding compounds ) , <unk> ( with compounds and soft contexts and without many figures of speech ) and <unk> ( with precise contexts and without many figures of speech ) are dominant .
