 The accompanying music video for " What Have You Done for Me Lately " was directed by Brian Jones and Piers Ashworth and filmed in December 1985 . The video 's choreographer was Paula Abdul , who appears in the video as Jackson 's friend . According to a Jet magazine publication in 1990 , in the video Abdul " combined sexual energy with classy , alluring moves . The combination propelled Janet into the classification of sexy superstar . Any who saw the videos witnessed the fact that Janet was , indeed , a full @-@ grown woman . " The video also featured Tina Landon who would later become Jackson 's choreographer . Jackson shared in her book True You in 2011 that her recording company thought it was important that she appeared thinner in the video : 
 " I 'd been told that my whole life , but at this critical juncture , with my career taking off , I didn 't have the wherewithal to argue . [ ... ] We [ she and Paula Abdul ] shared a house and spent weeks exercising [ in Canyon Ranch ] . [ ... ] I was as motivated as ever to come out on top . [ ... ] I felt good when it was over . I <unk> the compliments about my " new " shape . I shot the video and did in fact reshape my image . " 
 It premiered on BET on February 17 , 1986 . In the video , Jackson goes to a diner with her friends to talk about her relationship problems . Her boyfriend ( played by Rudy Huston ) shows up with his friends , and Jackson decides to share her feelings about their relationship . In the video , Jackson 's reality is a dark world with faded colors . In a more dreamscape world , the colors are vibrant and everything is 2D . 
 The " What Have You Done for Me Lately " video won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R & B / Soul or Rap Music Video in 1987 . While reviewing the video , Vanity Fair magazine said in 1986 that Jackson " might be Michael 's androgynous twin in the sweep of her arm , the accusatory glare in her eyes , the collapsing diagonals of her dancing " .

 Jackson performed " What Have You Done for Me Lately " on Soul Train on March 29 , 1986 . She also sang the song live at the Grammy Awards of 1987 , wearing an all @-@ black outfit , along with Jam and Lewis and dancers . She has also performed the song on all of her concert tours . On the 1990 Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour , it was the third song on the setlist . She performed the song with fellow dancers Tina Landon and Karen Owens , and was followed by a performance of " Let 's Wait Awhile " . On the Janet World Tour which happened in 1993 and continued throughout the two following years , the song was the second to be performed along with " Nasty " , with the singer wearing gold jewelry . For Jon Pareles from The New York Times , Jackson was a stronger vocalist than she was when she was on the last tour . In " What Have You Done for Me Lately " , she had new and syncopated vocals , which were different from the original song . 
 The song was performed during a " frenzied " medley of " Control " , " The Pleasure Principle " , and " Nasty " on The Velvet Rope Tour in 1998 . The medley at the October 11 , 1998 show in New York City , at the Madison Square Garden , was broadcast during a special titled The Velvet Rope : Live in Madison Square Garden by HBO . It was also added to the setlist at its DVD release , The Velvet Rope Tour – Live in Concert in 1999 . During the All for You Tour in 2001 and 2002 , " What Have You Done for Me Lately " was performed in a re @-@ worked version , during a medley with " Control " and " Nasty " . According to Denise Sheppard from Rolling Stone , it was " another crowd favorite ; perhaps best dubbed as the ' bitter ' portion of the night " , also adding that " this performer - who has been performing onstage for twenty @-@ eight years - knows what the crowd comes for and gives it to them in spades " . The February 16 , 2002 final date of the tour at the Aloha Stadium in Hawaii , was broadcast by HBO , and included a performance of it . This rendition was also added to the setlist at its DVD release , Janet : Live in Hawaii , in 2002 . 
 For her first tour in seven years Rock Witchu Tour in 2008 , she chose to open the show a medley with " The Pleasure Principle " , " Control " and " What Have You Done for Me Lately " . After an interlude , Jackson made her entrance amid fireworks and theatrical smoke to perform the medley , while donning a Mohawk hairstyle . While promoting her second greatest hits album Number Ones , the singer performed an eight @-@ minute medley of six hits during the American Music Awards of 2009 . It included " Control " , " Miss You Much " , " What Have You Done for Me Lately " , " If " , " Make Me " , and finished with " Together Again " . At the end of the performance , she received applauses and standing ovation from the audience . On the 2010 Essence Music Festival , held in New Orleans , Louisiana , Jackson included " What Have You Done for Me Lately " on the setlist , and performed wearing a one @-@ piece outfit with leotards underneath . On the Number Ones : Up Close and Personal tour in 2011 , the song was the third on the setlist . She performed it wearing a metallic catsuit . In August 30 , the song was dedicated to Portland as a part of the tour which Jackson dedicated a song for the city she was performing . It is included on her current 2015 @-@ 2016 Unbreakable World Tour .

 " What Have You Done for Me Lately " , in particular its title , was referenced in the 1987 film Eddie Murphy Raw , as a common question that women ask their partners prior to breaking up . It is featured in the 1989 made @-@ for @-@ television Disney film The Parent Trap III , when Jessie ( Monica Creel ) embarrasses herself during a karaoke dance skit called " The Jackson Three " , a parody of the Jackson Five , singing the song . American musician Prince started performing the track during his 1986 Parade tour stopping half way through and asking the audience " Who wrote that ? " then following up with his own Controversy track suggesting he did . He did it again during his 1990 Nude tour and during his shows in 2015 still stopping halfway through the song still asking " Who wrote this ? " . There was a dispute regarding the paternity of the music . Prince believed Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis used an old demo he did with them in the early days of the Time . He performed " What Have You Done for Me Lately " again in late 2013 during shows in Uncasville , Connecticut . Jackson 's sister La Toya Jackson sampled the song on her song " Wild Side " from her 1991 album No Relations . The song was interpolated for a medley sung in the 1993 comedy Sister Act 2 : Back in the Habit , and was covered by the American soul and funk band Sharon Jones & The Dap @-@ Kings in 2002 for their debut album , Dap <unk> ' with Sharon Jones and the Dap @-@ Kings . 
 " What Have You Done for Me Lately " is regarded as one of the singer 's singles which helped establish her as a known artist . Upon its debut , it was compared favorably to similar recordings of female empowerment released by black women , such as " New Attitude " by Patti LaBelle , " Better Be Good to Me " by Tina Turner and " Sisters Are Doin ' It for Themselves " by Aretha Franklin . Oprah Winfrey commented : " What you 're seeing in all the areas of arts and entertainment is black women internalizing the idea of black power and pride ... Black women started listening to their inner cues , rather than society or even the black community 's idea of what they are supposed to be and can be . " It ranked number three hundred and forty @-@ one on Blender 's list of " The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born " . In 2012 , Mike Staver wrote in Leadership Isn 't For Cowards : How to Drive Performance by Challenging People that " ' What Have You Done for Me Lately ? ' is not just some old Janet Jackson song , but a regular tune sung by leaders every day " .

 = Tabqa Dam = 
 The Tabqa Dam ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> ) , or al @-@ Thawra Dam as it is also named ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , literally dam of the revolution ) , is an earth @-@ fill dam on the Euphrates , located 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) upstream from the city of Ar @-@ Raqqah in Ar @-@ Raqqah Governorate , Syria . The dam is 60 metres ( 200 ft ) high and 4 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 8 mi ) long and is the largest dam in Syria . Its construction led to the creation of Lake Assad , Syria 's largest water reservoir . The dam was constructed between 1968 and 1973 with help from the Soviet Union . At the same time , an international effort was made to excavate and document as many archaeological remains as possible in the area of the future lake before they would be flooded by the rising water . When the flow of the Euphrates was reduced in 1974 to fill the lake behind the dam , a dispute broke out between Syria and Iraq that was settled by intervention from Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union . The dam was originally built to generate hydroelectric power , as well as irrigate lands on both sides of the Euphrates . The dam has not reached its full potential in either of these objectives . 
 = = Project history = = 
 In 1927 , when Syria was a French mandate , it was proposed to build a dam in the Euphrates near the Syro – Turkish border . After Syria became independent in 1946 , the feasibility of this proposal was re @-@ investigated , but the plan was not carried out . In 1957 , the Syrian government reached an agreement with the Soviet Union for technical and financial aid for the construction of a dam in the Euphrates . Syria , as part of the United Arab Republic ( UAR ) , signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 for a loan to finance the construction of the dam . After Syria left the UAR in 1961 , a new agreement about the financing of the dam was reached with the Soviet Union in 1965 . A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction of the dam . 
 Originally , the Tabqa Dam was conceived as a dual @-@ purpose dam . The dam would include a hydroelectric power station with eight turbines capable of producing 824 MW in total , and would irrigate an area of 640 @,@ 000 hectares ( 2 @,@ 500 sq mi ) on both sides of the Euphrates . Construction of the dam lasted between 1968 and 1973 , while the accompanying power station was finished in 1977 . Total cost of the dam was US $ 340 million of which US $ 100 million was in the form of a loan by the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union also provided technical expertise . During construction , up to 12 thousand Syrians and 900 Russian technicians worked on the dam . They were housed in the greatly expanded town near the construction site , which was subsequently renamed Al @-@ Thawra . To facilitate this project , as well as the construction of irrigation works on the Khabur River , the national railway system ( Chemins de Fer <unk> ) was extended from Aleppo to the dam , Ar @-@ Raqqa , Deir ez @-@ Zor , and eventually Al @-@ <unk> . The four thousand @-@ some Arab families who had been living in the flooded part of the Euphrates Valley were resettled in other parts of northern Syria . This resettlement was part of an only partially implemented plan to establish an " Arab belt " along the borders with Turkey and Iraq in order to separate Kurds living in Syria from Kurds living in Turkey and Iraq . 
 = = = Dispute with Iraq = = = 
 In 1974 , Syria started to fill the lake behind the dam by reducing the flow of the Euphrates . Slightly earlier , Turkey had started filling the reservoir of the newly constructed Keban Dam , and at the same time the area was also hit by significant drought . As a result , Iraq received significantly less water from the Euphrates than normal , and complained that annual Euphrates flow had dropped from 15 @.@ 3 cubic kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 cu mi ) in 1973 to 9 @.@ 4 cubic kilometres ( 2 @.@ 3 cu mi ) in 1975 . Iraq asked the Arab League to intervene but Syria argued that it received less water from Turkey as well and refused to cooperate . As a result , tensions rose and Iraq and Syria sent troops to their shared border . Iraq also threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam . Before the dispute could escalate any further , an agreement was reached in 1975 by mediation of Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union whereby Syria immediately increased the flow from the dam and reportedly henceforth agreed to let 60 percent of the Euphrates water flow into Iraq . In 1987 , Turkey , Syria and Iraq signed an agreement by which Turkey was committed to maintain an average Euphrates flow of 500 cubic metres ( 18 @,@ 000 cu ft ) per second into Syria , which translates into 16 cubic kilometres ( 3 @.@ 8 cu mi ) of water per year . 
 = = = Rescue excavations in the Lake Assad region = = = 
 The upper part of the Syrian Euphrates valley has been intensively occupied at least since the Late Natufian period ( 10 @,@ 800 – 9500 BC ) . <unk> and early twentieth @-@ century European travellers had already noted the presence of numerous archaeological sites in the area that would be flooded by the new reservoir . In order to preserve or at least document as many of these remains as possible , an extensive archaeological rescue programme was initiated during which more than 25 sites were excavated . 
 Between 1963 and 1965 , archaeological sites and remains were located with the help of aerial photographs , and a ground survey was carried out as well to determine the periods that were present at each site . Between 1965 and 1970 , foreign archaeological missions carried out systematic excavations at the sites of Mureybet ( United States ) , Tell <unk> ( Belgium ) , <unk> Kabira , <unk> ( Germany ) , <unk> ( Netherlands ) , and Emar ( France ) . With help from UNESCO , two minarets at Mureybet and <unk> were <unk> measured , and a protective glacis was built around the castle Qal 'at Ja 'bar . The castle was located on a hilltop that would not be flooded , but the lake would turn it in an island . The castle is now connected to the shore by a causeway . 
 In 1971 , with support from UNESCO , Syria appealed to the international community to participate in the efforts to salvage as many archaeological remains as possible before the area would disappear under the rising water of Lake Assad . To stimulate foreign participation , the Syrian antiquities law was modified so that foreign missions had the right to claim a part of the artefacts that were found during excavation . As a result , between 1971 and 1974 , numerous excavations were carried out in the Lake Assad area by Syrian as well as foreign missions . Syrian archaeologists worked at the sites of Tell al- ' Abd , ' <unk> al @-@ <unk> , Tell Sheikh Hassan , Qal 'at Ja 'bar , <unk> Faraj and Tell Fray . There were missions from the United States on <unk> Faraj , Tell Fray and Shams ed @-@ Din @-@ <unk> ; from France on Mureybet and Emar ; from Italy on Tell Fray ; from the Netherlands on Tell Ta 'as , <unk> , Jebel ' <unk> and <unk> ; from Switzerland on Tell al @-@ Hajj ; from Great Britain on Abu <unk> and Tell es @-@ <unk> ; and from Japan on Tell <unk> . In addition , the minarets of Mureybet and <unk> were moved to higher locations , and Qal 'at Ja 'bar was further reinforced and restored . Many finds from the excavations are now on display in the National Museum of Aleppo , where a special permanent exhibition is devoted to the finds from the Lake Assad region . 
 = = = Other dams in the Syrian Euphrates valley = = = 
 After the completion of the Tabqa Dam , Syria built two more dams in the Euphrates , both of which were functionally related to the Tabqa Dam . The Baath Dam , located 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) downstream from the Tabqa Dam , was completed in 1986 and functions as a floodwater control to manage the irregular output of the Tabqa Dam and as a hydroelectric power station . The <unk> Dam , which functions primarily as a hydroelectric power station , has been constructed 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) south from the Syro – Turkish border and filling of the reservoir started in 1999 . Its construction was partly motivated by the disappointing performance of the Tabqa Dam . The implementation of a fourth dam between Ar @-@ Raqqah and Deir ez @-@ Zor – the <unk> Dam – has recently been initiated with an appeal to archaeologists to excavate sites that will be flooded by the new reservoir . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on 11 February 2013 that the dam was captured by the Syrian opposition in their fight against the government . As of May 2013 the village near the dam , Al @-@ <unk> , is occupied by the <unk> al @-@ <unk> Brigade . Four of the dam 's eight turbines are operational and the original staff continues to manage the dam . Workers at the dam still receive pay from the Syrian Government and fighting in the area will temporary cease if repairs are needed . 
 = = Characteristics of the dam and the reservoir = = 
 The Tabqa dam is located on a spot where rocky outcrops on each side of the Euphrates Valley are less than 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) apart . The dam is an earth @-@ fill dam that is 4 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 8 mi ) long , 60 metres ( 200 ft ) high from the riverbed ( 307 metres ( 1 @,@ 007 ft ) above sea @-@ level ) , 512 metres ( 1 @,@ 680 ft ) wide at its base and 19 metres ( 62 ft ) at the top . The hydroelectric power station is located on the southern end of the dam and contains eight Kaplan turbines . The turbines ' rotation speed is 125 RPM , and they can potentially generate 103 MW each . Lake Assad is 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) long and on average 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) wide . The reservoir can potentially hold 11 @.@ 7 cubic kilometres ( 2 @.@ 8 cu mi ) of water , at which size its surface area would be 610 square kilometres ( 240 sq mi ) . Annual evaporation is 1 @.@ 3 cubic kilometres ( 0 @.@ 31 cu mi ) due to the high average summer temperature in northern Syria . This is high compared to reservoirs upstream from Lake Assad . For example , the evaporation at Keban Dam Lake is 0 @.@ 48 cubic kilometres ( 0 @.@ 12 cu mi ) per year at roughly the same surface area . 
 Neither the Tabqa Dam nor Lake Assad is currently used to its full economic potential . Although the lake can potentially hold 11 @.@ 7 cubic kilometres ( 2 @.@ 8 cu mi ) , actual capacity is 9 @.@ 6 cubic kilometres ( 2 @.@ 3 cu mi ) , with a surface area of 447 square kilometres ( 173 sq mi ) . The proposed irrigation scheme suffered from a number of problems , including the high gypsum content in the reclaimed soils around Lake Assad , soil salinization , the collapse of canals that distributed the water from Lake Assad , and the unwillingness of farmers to resettle in the reclaimed areas . As a result , only 60 @,@ 000 hectares ( 230 sq mi ) were irrigated from Lake Assad in 1984 . In 2000 , the irrigated surface had risen to 124 @,@ 000 hectares ( 480 sq mi ) , which is 19 percent of the projected 640 @,@ 000 hectares ( 2 @,@ 500 sq mi ) . Due to lower than expected water flow from Turkey , as well as lack of maintenance , the dam generates only 150 MW instead of 800 MW . Lake Assad is the most important source of drinking water to Aleppo , providing the city through a pipeline with 0 @.@ 08 cubic kilometres ( 0 @.@ 019 cu mi ) of drinking water per year . The lake also supports a fishing industry . 
 = = = Environmental effects = = = 
 Research indicates that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria . This increase can , among other things , be related to the lower discharge of the Euphrates as a result of the construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project ( GAP ) in Turkey , and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa Dam in Syria . High @-@ salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes . 
 The shore of the lake has developed into an important marshland area . On the southeastern shore , some areas have been reforested with evergreen trees including the Aleppo pine and the Euphrates poplar . Lake Assad is an important wintering location for migratory birds and the government has recently undertaken measures to protect small areas along the shores of Lake Assad from hunters by downgrading access roads . The island of <unk> al @-@ Thawra has been designated a nature reserve .

 The Moving Picture World reviewed it positively , stating that the film was " pleasingly melodramatic in which we find our old friends , hero , heroine and villain , who always entertain us when they really live up to their characters . ... It is humanly and naturally acted , the scenes are well made and often poetic , and the story moves smoothly without dragging . " 
 The film 's enduring legacy stems from the disputed belief that Lon Chaney debuted in this film . Jon C. Mirsalis writes " None of the characters are billed in this Rex melodrama , although Chaney is clearly featured in a publicity still . This is the earliest known film in which Chaney appeared , but is undoubtedly one of many unbilled appearances he made at Universal . " In the Michael Blake 's book A Thousand Faces : Lon Chaney 's Unique Artistry in Motion Pictures does not mention the film , but notes that the possibility exists of Chaney performing in a role during a period of unemployment in 1912 . The date of the film 's production is unknown , but the book notes that he rejoined Clarence Kolb and Max Dill 's company in San Francisco , California in September 1912 . The documentary Lon Chaney : A Thousand Faces also states that Chaney 's first works were at Nestor Studios . " The documentary also notes that his film debut occurred after his wife 's suicide attempt in April 1913 . 
 The film is now considered lost . It is unknown when the film was lost , but if it was in Universal 's vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal 's silent era films in 1948 . 
 = Kolberg @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Kolberg class was a group of four light cruisers built for the German Imperial Navy and used during the First World War . The class comprised four vessels : SMS Kolberg , the lead ship , Mainz , Cöln , and Augsburg . The ships were built between 1908 and 1910 , and two , Kolberg and Augsburg , were modernized in 1916 – 1917 . The ships were armed with a main battery of twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns and had a design speed of 25 @.@ 5 knots ( 47 @.@ 2 km / h ; 29 @.@ 3 mph ) . The first three ships were assigned to the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet ; Augsburg was instead used as a torpedo and gunnery training ship . 
 At the outbreak of war in August 1914 , Augsburg was deployed to the Baltic , while Kolberg , Mainz , and Cöln remained in the North Sea . The three ships were assigned to patrol duty in the Heligoland Bight ; on 28 August 1914 , they were attacked during the Battle of Heligoland Bight . Mainz and Cöln were both sunk in the battle . Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 , and joined Augsburg for the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 . Both ships also saw service during Operation Albion in October 1917 . Both ships survived the war ; Kolberg was ceded to France , where she was renamed Colmar and served in the French Navy until 1927 . Augsburg was surrendered to Japan and was then sold for scrap .

 The ships were steel @-@ built ; their hulls were constructed with longitudinal and transverse steel frames . The hulls contained thirteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for fifty percent of the length of the keel . The ships were good sea boats , although they suffered from severe rolling and were fairly stiff . They were not very maneuverable and had a large turning radius . Steering was controlled by a single rudder . Their transverse metacentric height was <unk> m ( 2 ft 9 in ) . The ships had a standard crew of 18 officers and 349 enlisted men and carried a number of smaller vessels , including one picket boat , one barge , one cutter , two yawls , and two dinghies .

Mainz was powered by two AEG @-@ Curtiss turbines driving a pair of three @-@ bladed screws 3 @.@ 45 m ( 11 @.@ 3 ft ) in diameter . Cöln initially had Zoelly turbines , though before sea trials , these were replaced with two sets of Germania turbines with four three @-@ bladed screws ; two were 2 @.@ 55 m ( 8 ft 4 in ) in diameter , and two were 1 @.@ 78 m ( 5 ft 10 in ) wide . Augsburg was equipped with two sets of Parsons turbines with four 3 @-@ bladed screws 2 @.@ 25 m in diameter . All four ships were equipped with fifteen Marine type water @-@ tube boilers , divided into four boiler rooms on the centerline . In 1916 , Kolberg and Augsburg were equipped with supplementary oil @-@ firing to increase the burn rate of the coal @-@ fired boilers ; Mainz and Cöln had been sunk by that time . 
 The ships ' engines were designed to give 19 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 14 @,@ 000 kW ) , with the exception of Mainz 's engines , which were rated at 20 @,@ 200 shp ( 15 @,@ 100 kW ) . These were powered by fifteen coal @-@ fired Marine water @-@ tube boilers , which were trunked into three evenly spaced funnels . These gave the ships a top speed of 25 @.@ 5 knots ( 47 @.@ 2 km / h ; 29 @.@ 3 mph ) ; Mainz 's more powerful engines gave her a half @-@ knot speed advantage . All four ships exceeded these figures on speed trials , however , and all four cruisers reached speeds in excess of 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) . Kolberg carried 970 t ( 950 long tons ; 1 @,@ 070 short tons ) of coal , and after 1916 , 115 t ( 113 long tons ; 127 short tons ) of oil . This gave her a maximum range of approximately 3 @,@ 250 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 020 km ; 3 @,@ 740 mi ) at 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) .

 = = Service history = = 
 After their commissioning , Kolberg , Mainz , and Cöln were assigned to the II Scouting Group , part of the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet . Augsburg was instead used as a training ship for torpedo crews and gunnery . Cöln was assigned as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the II Scouting Group was deployed to a patrol line based on the island of Heligoland . Augsburg meanwhile was mobilized for active service and sent into the Baltic . There , she participated in an operation that saw the first shots of the war fired against the Russians , on 2 August . 
 On the morning of 28 August , the British Harwich Force , supported by the battlecruisers of Vice Admiral David Beatty 's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron , broke into the Heligoland Bight and attacked the II Scouting Group patrols . In the confused action , Mainz and Cöln were sunk , by light cruisers and battlecruisers , respectively . The majority of crewmen from Mainz were picked up by the British ships , but Cöln was lost with only one survivor . Kolberg was stationed in port during the attack , and steamed out to support the beleaguered German forces , but the British had departed by the time she reached the scene . 
 Kolberg continued to serve with the reconnaissance forces in the North Sea , including seeing action at the raid on Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914 , where she laid a minefield off the British coast , and the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 . At Dogger Bank , she fired the first shots — and scored the first hits — of the engagement , at the cruiser HMS Aurora . Augsburg was meanwhile heavily engaged in the Baltic ; in June 1915 , she participated in a minelaying operation in the Gulf of Finland that saw the loss of the minelayer SMS Albatross . 
 Kolberg then joined her sister in the Baltic during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 . During the operation , Kolberg and the battlecruiser Von der Tann bombarded Russian positions on Utö , while Augsburg steamed into the Gulf with the battleship Posen , where they sank a Russian gunboat and damaged another . By 19 August , the danger of British and Russian submarines in the Gulf prompted the Germans to withdraw . Augsburg participated in another , unsuccessful attempt to force the Gulf in late 1916 . Both ships were present for Operation Albion , another large @-@ scale assault on the Gulf of Riga , in October 1917 . The ships were involved in a variety of operations , including minesweeping , and screening for the battleships König and Kronprinz while they destroyed Russian opposition in the Gulf . Men from Kolberg also landed on one of the islands to destroy a Russian gun battery . 
 Both ships survived the war . As part of the Treaty of Versailles , which ended the war , the ships were awarded to the victorious powers as war prizes . Kolberg was allocated to France , where she was commissioned into the French Navy as Colmar . Augsburg was transferred to Japanese control ; having no use for her , they sold the ship for scrapping . Colmar saw one tour on colonial duty in Asia in 1924 , where she participated in a multinational operation to protect foreign nationals from Chinese unrest in Shanghai . She was subsequently stricken in 1927 and broken up for scrap in Brest , France .

 The 7th Boat Race took place on the River Thames on 17 March 1845 . The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge . It was the first time the event was contested along The Championship Course , from Putney to Mortlake . The race was won by Cambridge who beat Oxford by a distance of ten lengths . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race , first held in 1829 , is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having defeated Cambridge by four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in the previous race held in 1842 . However , Cambridge led overall with four wins to Oxford 's two . 
 The universities failed to agree on a location or a date for a race in 1843 or 1844 , so no contests were held those years . In November 1844 , the Cambridge University Boat Club secretary wrote to Oxford in an attempt to re @-@ start the Easter running of the Boat Race . The Oxford committee " seemed willing " and in the Lent term proposed a change to the course , to race above Putney Bridge rather than below it on 15 March . It was the first Boat Race to be conducted between Putney and Mortlake on The Championship Course , previous races having taken place between Westminster Bridge and Putney Bridge , or on the Thames at Henley between Hambleden Lock and Henley Bridge . Cambridge arrived in London on the Wednesday before the race , Oxford following two days later . Following their displays in practice rows , Cambridge were considered favourites for the race . 
 The Cambridge boat was built by Logan and belonged to Second Trinity Boat Club , while Oxford 's was constructed by King 's of Oxford . The umpire for the race was W. H. Harrison , Commodore of the Royal Thames Yacht Club , while the starter was Edward Searle . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11 st 9 lb ( 73 @.@ 8 kg ) , 6 @.@ 375 pounds ( 2 @.@ 9 kg ) per rower more than their Light Blue opposition . None of the crews had rowed in previous Boat Races .

 The conditions for the race were " of the most inclement possible " and the water " very rough " . Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station , handing the Surrey station to Oxford . The Light Blues made the better start but swell from a steamer dislodged the oar of Richardson and allowed Oxford to take the lead . Cambridge gradually recovered to draw level and by Bishop of London 's Walk were clear . Despite poor steering from both coxes ( and Henry Munster losing his hat while waving it at the crowds ) , Cambridge were three lengths ahead by Hammersmith Bridge . They continued to pull away and won by ten lengths in a time of 23 minutes 30 seconds . It was their fifth victory overall , to Oxford 's two since the first Boat Race of 1829 . Cambridge inflicted a second defeat on Oxford later that year , winning the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta . 
 = Maranatha ( Millennium ) = 
 " ' Maranatha " is the twenty @-@ first episode of the first season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It premiered on the Fox network on May 9 , 1997 . The episode was written by Chip Johannessen , and directed by Peter Markle . " Maranatha " featured guest appearances by Bill Nunn , Boris Krutonog and Levani Outchaneichvili . 
 Millennium Group consultant Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) aids both the New York Police Department and a Russian investigator to track down the mysterious " <unk> " , a criminal from the Russian underworld who may be an incarnation of the biblical beast from the sea . 
 " Maranatha " , a title which translates from Aramaic as " our lord has come " , connects the 1986 Chernobyl disaster to biblical prophecies of the star of Wormwood . The episode features the first of two directorial contributions from Markle , and sees future guest star Brian Downey appear in a minor role . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In New York City , a man named Yaponchik ( Levani Outchaneichvili ) shoots a man in the face , preventing the victim 's identification ; this is the third such murder committed this way . Millennium Group consultant Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) is asked to aid the New York Police Department investigate the case . Black is joined by a Muscovite investigator , Yura Surova ( Boris Krutonog ) , and an undercover agent , Andrei Medikov ( Dmitri <unk> ) . Examining the victim 's body , a symbol is found on the corpse resembling an inverted V , but its meaning is unknown . 
 Black , Medikov and Surova visit a Russian nightclub where the latter two are working undercover . As Surova and Black talk at one table , Medikov is approached by Yaponchik . Someone in the club recognizes Yaponchik , and the crowd stampede out of the building when they hear his name . After the crowd has dispersed , Black and Surova find Medikov 's body at a table , his face shot off . 
 Surova explains to Black that Yaponchik has come to be regarded by Russians as a sort of evil folkloric figure . Meanwhile , Group member Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) determines that the " V " -like symbol found earlier is actually a fragment of the Chi Rho , a Christian symbol . Watts also informs Black that many Russians believe Yaponchik to have directly responsible for the Chernobyl disaster , a Soviet nuclear meltdown tied by some to Biblical prophecies of the apocalypse . Black researches the disaster , finding a picture of both Medikov and Surova at the Chernobyl nuclear plant , and realizes that both men have been tracking Yaponchik for revenge . 
 One of Yaponchik 's victims is identified as a restorer of Russian icons . Her home is searched , and it is found that she had uncovered Yaponchik 's identity and attempted to appease him by sending him several icons . Black feels Yaponchik is killing in order to perpetuate the legends surrounding him by instilling fear in those who believe them . Watts and Black visit the Russian Embassy to find the man the icons were being mailed to — Sergei Stepanovich , identifiable as Yaponchik . Stepanovich is protected by diplomatic immunity ; however , it becomes clear that Surova , Medikov and an Orthodox priest who aided the investigation have all been stalking Stepanovich , who they believe to be the Antichrist . 
 Yaponchik murders another two men at a bathhouse , but is confronted by Surova . Yaponchik tells Surova he cannot be killed . Surova ignores this , and shoots him in the head . Yaponchik is then found and rushed to hospital . Black sees the crime scene at the bathhouse , and draws a connection between Yaponchik and the beast from the sea in the Biblical Book of Revelation , who is said to survive a fatal head wound ; fearing that Yaponchik will likewise survive , Black heads to the hospital . Surova beats him there , however , and confronts the recovered Yaponchik . As Surova is about to shoot his quarry again , he is convinced instead that Yaponchik is " not the one " he is thought to be . Surova helps Yaponchik make his way to the helipad on the hospital 's roof . Black and Watts arrive on the roof in time to see Yaponchik escorted onto a helicopter by several men , who take off before they can be apprehended . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Maranatha " was directed by Peter Markle , making his first contribution to the series . Markle would later return to helm the third season episode " Seven and One " . The episode was written by Chip Johannessen , who went on to write a total of twelve episodes across all three seasons , including the series ' final episode " Goodbye to All That " . After Millennium 's cancellation , Johannessen would also contribute an episode to its sister show The X @-@ Files , 1999 's " Orison " . Johannessen would also become one of the series ' executive producers during its third season , alongside Ken Horton . 
 The episode 's title , " Maranatha " , is an Aramaic language word translated as " our lord has come " or " come , our lord " ; the word is found in the biblical First Epistle to the Corinthians and is believed to have been used as a greeting among early Christians . During production , the episode used the working title " The Second Coming " . 
 The character Peter Watts makes mention of the origin of the name of Chernobyl , a city in Ukraine that was the location of the Chernobyl disaster , a 1986 nuclear meltdown . According to Watts , the name " Chernobyl " translates as " wormwood " , causing the disaster to be likened to the Biblical star of Wormwood prophesied in the Book of Revelation , which was said to cause death through poisoning the waters . However , the word " <unk> " can be translated as " black grass " or " black myth " . Actor Brian Downey , who portrayed a medical examiner in the episode , later appeared in an unrelated role in the two @-@ part second season episodes " Owls " and " Roosters " . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 " Maranatha " was first broadcast on the Fox Network on May 9 , 1997 . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6 @.@ 7 during its original broadcast , meaning that 6 @.@ 7 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode . This represented 6 @.@ 5 million households , and left the episode the sixty @-@ fifth most @-@ viewed broadcast that week . 
 The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics . The A.V. Club 's Zack Handlen rated the episode a B + , describing it as " a ho @-@ hum X @-@ Files knock @-@ off " . Handlen felt that the acting was strong , and that the references to both Chernobyl and apocalyptic prophecies formed a good basis for the episode ; however , he noted that the script 's uncertainty as to whether its villain really was the Antichrist caused it to lose impact . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated the episode 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 , praising its " incredibly tight script " and describing it as " one of the best examples of Millennium 's careful balancing act between reality and the otherworldly " . 
 However , Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode two stars out of five , finding that its plot " gets lost in the mix " amidst the details and atmosphere of the setting . Shearman compared the folkloric feel of Yaponchik as a Russian incarnation of the devil to the American view of the devil as an invasion of the family unit , as personified by the character Lucy Butler in " Lamentation " , finding the two symbols to work well in contrast to each other . However , he was unsure that the increasingly eschatological direction the series was taking was a positive move , as it left the central character Frank Black " largely forgotten " . 
 = Sisimiut = 
 Sisimiut , formerly Holsteinsborg , is the capital and largest city of the Qeqqata municipality , and the second @-@ largest city in Greenland . 
 It is located in central @-@ western Greenland , on the coast of Davis Strait , approximately 320 km ( 200 mi ) north of Nuuk . 
 Although now a place @-@ name , Sisimiut literally means " the people at the fox burrows " . The site has been inhabited for the last 4 @,@ 500 years , first by the Inuit peoples of the Saqqaq culture , Dorset culture , and then the Thule people , whose descendants form the majority of the current population . Artifacts from the early settlement era can be found throughout the region , favored in the past for its plentiful fauna , particularly the marine mammals providing subsistence for the early hunting societies . The population of modern Greenlanders in Sisimiut is a mix of the Inuit and Danish peoples , who first settled in the area in the 1720s , under the leadership of the Danish missionary , Hans Egede . 
 Today , Sisimiut is the largest business center north of the national capital of Nuuk and is one of the fastest growing cities in Greenland . Fishing is the principal industry in Sisimiut , although the town has a growing industrial base . KNI and its subsidiary Pilersuisoq , a state @-@ owned chain of all @-@ purpose general stores in Greenland , have their base in Sisimiut . Architecturally , Sisimiut is a mix of traditional , single @-@ family houses , and communal housing , with apartment blocks raised in the 1960s during a period of town expansion in Greenland . Sisimiut is still expanding , with the area north of the port , on the shore of the small Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay reserved for a modern suburb @-@ style housing slated for construction in the 2010s . Several professional and general schools are based in Sisimiut , providing education to the inhabitants of the city and to those from smaller settlements in the region . The new Taseralik Culture Center is the second cultural center to be established in Greenland , after <unk> in Nuuk . 
 The city has its own bus line , and is the northernmost year @-@ round ice @-@ free port in the country , a shipping base for western and northwestern Greenland . Supply ships head from the commercial port towards smaller settlements in more remote regions of Uummannaq Fjord , Upernavik Archipelago , and as far as Qaanaaq in northern Greenland . The town airport is served by Air Greenland , providing connections to other towns on the western coast of Greenland , and through Kangerlussuaq Airport , to Europe . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Prehistory = = = 
 = = = = Saqqaq culture = = = = 
 Sisimiut has been a settlement site for around 4 @,@ 500 years , with the people of the Saqqaq culture arriving from Arctic Canada during the first wave of immigration , occupying numerous sites on the coast of western Greenland . At that time , the shoreline was up to several dozen meters above the present line , gradually decreasing in time due to post @-@ glacial rebound . The Saqqaq remained in western Greenland for nearly two millennia . Unlike the following waves of migrants in the millennium following their disappearance , the Saqqaq left behind a substantial number of artifacts , with plentiful archeological finds on the coast of Davis Strait , from Disko Bay ( Greenlandic : <unk> <unk> ) in the north — to the coast of Labrador Sea near Nuuk in the <unk> has uncovered the changing settlement pattern , exhibiting transition from the single @-@ family dwellings to tiny villages of several families . The types of dwelling varied from tent rings made of the hides of hunted mammals , to stone hearths , with no evidence of communal living in larger structures . In contrast , there is evidence for reindeer hunting as a coordinated effort of either villagers or groups of more loosely related individuals , with gathering places in proximity of the hunting grounds being found . Despite recent advances in DNA research based on hair samples from the ancient Saqqaq migrants ( which gives insight into their origin ) , the reason for the decline and subsequent disappearance of the culture are not yet known . 
 = = = = Dorset culture = = = = 
 After several hundred years of no permanent habitation , the second wave of migration arrived from Canada , bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland . The first wave of immigrants , known as Dorset I , arrived around 500 BCE , inhabiting the region for the next 700 years . The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people , although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut , and few artifacts from the era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites , with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones . The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further north in the Disko Bay region , while the further to the south , the poorer the finds , disappearing completely on the coast of Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland . 
 = = = Thule people = = = 
 The Inuit of the Thule culture — whose descendants form the majority of the current population — arrived nearly a thousand years ago , with the first arrivals dated to approximately 13th and 14th century . The Thule people were more technologically advanced than their Dorset predecessors , although they still relied on subsistence hunting , with walruses , reindeer , and particularly the fur seals constituting the base of the economy in the early period . 
 The shoreline was still at a higher altitude than today , with the Sisimiut valley east of the Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay , partially under sea . Many artifacts and graves from the several centuries of permanent settlement remain scattered in the region . Rich in fauna , the coastal region from Sisimiut to <unk> was particularly attractive for migrants , and due to a large number of historical artifacts it is currently listed as a candidate for the UNESCO World Heritage Site , with the application received in 2003 . 
 = = = Colonial era = = = 
 There are no signs of Norse settlement in the region . At the time of Hans Egede 's establishment of the first Danish colonies , Dutch whalers dominated the area and swiftly burnt down his Bergen Company whaling station on <unk> Island , approximately 30 km ( 19 mi ) to the north of the present @-@ day town . It was not until Jacob Severin was granted a full monopoly on the Greenlandic trade and permitted to act as an agent of the Danish navy that the Dutch were finally removed in a series of battles in 1738 and 1739 . 
 The present town was established in 1764 by the General Trade Company as the trading post of Holsteinsborg ( " Fort Holstein " ) , named for the first chairman of the Danish College of Missions in Copenhagen which underwrote and directed the missionary work in the colony . At the time of its founding , the Kalaallisut name of the place was <unk> , after its fjord . The colonists formally established several villages in the region , of which only two remain to this day : <unk> and <unk> . Under the Royal Greenland Trading Department , Holsteinsborg was a center of the trade in reindeer skins . 
 Several 18th @-@ century buildings still stand in Sisimiut , among them the 1725 <unk> ( " Old House " ) and the 1775 Bethel @-@ <unk> ( " Bethel Church " ) or <unk> Kirke ( " Blue Church " ) , the oldest surviving church in Greenland . The buildings were moved from the former site of the settlement at <unk> ( Holsteinsborg ) together with the rest of the settlement . The new church on the rocky pedestal was built in 1926 , further extended in 1984 . The entrance to the yard with the old church and other protected historical buildings is decorated with a unique gate made of whale jawbone . In 1801 , a smallpox epidemic decimated the population of Sisimiut and other coastal settlements , although the population growth quickly resumed due to plentiful marine life on the coast . 
 = = = 20th century - present = = = 
 The 20th century saw industrialization , through the construction of a shipping port , and a fish processing factory of Royal Greenland in 1924 , the first such factory in Greenland . Fishing remains the primary occupation of Sisimiut inhabitants , with the town becoming the leading center of shrimping and shrimp processing . Until 2008 Sisimiut had been the administrative center of Sisimiut Municipality , which was then incorporated into the new Qeqqata Municipality on 1 January 2009 , with Sisimiut retaining its status as the administrative center of the new unit , consisting also of the former Maniitsoq Municipality and the previously unincorporated area of Kangerlussuaq . The municipal council , seated in the town hall and headed by Mayor Hermann <unk> , consists of 13 members , including the mayor and his deputies , and representatives of the four primary political parties of Greenland : <unk> , <unk> , Democrats and Inuit <unk> . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Sisimiut is located approximately 320 km ( 200 mi ) north of Nuuk , and 75 km ( 47 mi ) north of the Arctic Circle , on the eastern shores of Davis Strait , perched on a series of rocky outcrops at the western end of a large peninsula bounded from the north by the <unk> <unk> fjord and from the south by the wide Amerloq Fjord . 
 = = = Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay = = = 
 Immediately to the north of Sisimiut a small inlet of Davis Strait , the Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay ( Danish : <unk> ) , separates the town from the Palasip Qaqqaa massif in the north , at the southern foot of which the town airport is located . The 544 m ( 1 @,@ 785 ft ) high twin summit commands a wide view in all directions , with the majority of the coast of the Qeqqata municipality visible in good conditions . 
 The bay is navigable in its entirety , protected from the open sea by a series of skerries in the west . Both the local port and the local sailing harbor are located on the southern shore of the bay . The 2 @.@ 2 NM ( 4 @.@ 1 km ; 2 @.@ 5 mi ) road to the airport passes through the bridge over the Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay . Halfway between the town and the airport there is a small beach of dark sand . The beach , as well as the skerries off the coast , are very popular in the summer . 
 = = = Alanngorsuaq = = = 
 To the east , a wide valley extends into the interior of the peninsula , bounded from the north by the conjoint massif of Palasip Qaqqaa and <unk> , dissected by the <unk> <unk> valley alongside which leads the Polar Route from Sisimiut to Kangerlussuaq . Depending on variants , the route is between 150 km ( 93 mi ) and 170 km ( 110 mi ) long . 
 In the middle of the valley towers a standalone Alanngorsuaq mountain ( 411 m ( 1 @,@ 348 ft ) ) , surrounded by several lakes , one of which serves Sisimiut town as a water reservoir . The entire area of the valley is another popular picnic destination , with easy access to the water reservoirs by a gravel road in the middle part of the valley . The reservoirs in the valley provide the town waterworks with 882 @,@ 000 m3 ( 1 @,@ 154 @,@ 000 cu yd ) of water , with the potential for 7 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 m3 ( 9 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 cu yd ) annually . 
 = = = Nasaasaaq = = = 
 To the southeast , the valley is bounded by the Nasaasaaq massif with several distinct summits , the highest of which is 784 m ( 2 @,@ 572 ft ) . The Nasaasaaq ridge has several summits . The main summit is the most prominent , rising over the remainder of the ridge in a tall 150 m ( 490 ft ) cone at 784 m ( 2 @,@ 572 ft ) . The ridge terminates in a 611 m ( 2 @,@ 005 ft ) <unk> overlooking Sisimiut . To the east the ridge gradually falls to nearly 300 m ( 980 ft ) , before turning east @-@ north @-@ east towards the <unk> massif . The southern wall of Nasaasaaq falls directly to Amerloq Fjord . The northern wall is not a uniform surface , dissected by ledges , <unk> , and ramps . 
 The main access route to the summit leads through one of the ramps to the saddle between the main summit and its western <unk> . The passage on the top cone is secured by ropes for unprepared tourists . One of the variants of the Polar Route follows the coast of Amerloq Fjord at the base of the southern wall of Nasaasaaq . The main summit is visited for its long @-@ range view of the coast , although more limited to the north than that of Palasip Qaqqaa to the north of the town airport . An alternative route to the top of interest to mountaineers leads through the hard to find low pass to the east of the main summit , and from there directly on the summit cone ridge . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Sisimiut lies within the polar climate region , belonging to the E group of the Köppen climate classification . The average temperature is 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) or lower throughout the year . The coldest months on average are February and March which have average highs of − 10 @.@ 2 ° C ( 13 @.@ 6 ° F ) and − 10 @.@ 1 ° C ( 13 @.@ 8 ° F ) respectively . The warmest months are July and August which have average highs of 9 @.@ 8 ° C ( 49 @.@ 6 ° F ) and 9 @.@ 3 ° C ( 48 @.@ 7 ° F ) respectively and are the only months of the year in which the average lows are above 1 ° C ( 34 ° F ) , both at 3 @.@ 3 ° C ( 37 @.@ 9 ° F ) . Precipitation is very low in Sisimiut , with the greatest amount of rainfall occurring in the second half of the year , between July and December , with August and September being the wettest months . The sea winds from Davis Strait moderate the climate , with the area known for its fogs . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 With 5 @,@ 598 inhabitants in 2013 , Sisimiut is one of the fastest @-@ growing towns in Greenland , with migrants from the smaller settlements reinforcing the trend . Apart from Kangerlussuaq , it is the only settlement in the Qeqqata municipality exhibiting stable growth patterns over the last two decades . 
 The gender imbalance is evident in Sisimiut , with men consistently outnumbering women during the last two decades , running from 20 % in 1991 , to 13 % in 2000 and 2010 . Nearly 10 % of the town 's inhabitants in 2010 were born outside Greenland , a decline from 16 @.@ 5 % in 1990 and 11 @.@ 8 % in 2000 .

 Most families in Sisimiut live in single @-@ family houses , most often the traditional colorful wooden prefabricated homes shipped from Denmark , and almost always raised or supported by a concrete foundation due to permafrost . In the 1960s , Danish authorities began construction of communal apartment blocks in most towns in Greenland , including Sisimiut . 
 Unlike in Nuuk , the modern environmentally friendly construction technologies have not yet arrived to Sisimiut , and in 2010 the existing communal @-@ block district remained in a state of partial disrepair . The Qeqqata municipality however is planning the town expansion in the 2010s , with the area north of the Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay reserved for real estate . The new neighborhood will bear the name <unk> . 
 = = Economy and infrastructure = =

 Fishing is the principal industry in Sisimiut , with harvested stocks of shrimps , salmon , halibut and cod . The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp @-@ shelling factories in the world . In 2008 , supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers , the plant processed an annual amount of 20 @,@ 180 tons of shrimp , around 1 @,@ 680 tons per month . This was roughly constant throughout the year , although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen . The plant eventually sold around 6 @,@ 019 tonnes of shrimp . Hunting is also important to some of the local livelihoods , mainly seals , walrus , beluga whale , narwhale , reindeer and muskoxen . 
 KNI and its subsidiary Pilersuisoq , a state @-@ owned chain of all @-@ purpose general stores in Greenland , are based in Sisimiut . The Pilersuisoq chain operates in all small settlements in the country , as well as smaller towns which are not covered by supermarket chains . A range of shops operate in Sisimiut , from chain supermarkets of <unk> and <unk> to independent outlets , also serving supplies to the smaller settlements in the region . <unk> , a liquid fuel distribution company , is headquartered in Sisimiut . It employs 70 staff and operates 70 stations in Greenland . The headquarters were moved from Maniitsoq to Sisimiut in the late 2000s . In 2010 KNI announced plans to also move the operational base of <unk> from Maniitsoq to Sisimiut , causing protests in the former community already experiencing depopulation . Other facilities include two banks , a library , a Post Greenland office and a small hospital / health center with 19 beds . 
 There are advanced plans for the Alcoa aluminium smelting plant . Maniitsoq , the second @-@ largest town in the municipality , is another proposed location alongside Sisimiut . The plant would provide employment for 600 – 700 people , or more than 10 % of the population . As it is a vital decision for the town , wide public consultations were carried out in 2008 – 2010 by both the town authorities and the Government of Greenland in order to address potential environmental and social concerns . The Sisimiut Hydro Power Plant is located north of the town . The plant has two turbines providing 15 megawatts of power and the electricity from the plant is transferred to Sisimiut by a 27 @.@ 4 km ( 17 @.@ 0 mi ) long high voltage line . 
 Although rainfall is low , <unk> has abundant natural supplies of fresh , drinkable surface water , collected from a reservoir under Alanngorsuaq . Water is also pumped to the waterworks from another lake around 2 @.@ 5 kilometers away in the mountains . The water mains are <unk> and electrically anti @-@ <unk> so supply the residents during the winter months . The water supply network is capable of producing some 882 @,@ 000 cubic meters of water per year ; two water @-@ supplying lakes by the town have a combined annual minimum capacity of more than 7 @.@ 2 million cubic meters .

 Tourist facilities in Sisimiut include several youth hostels and hotels , such as Hotel Sisimiut with Restaurant Nasaasaaq , and Seaman 's Home , and a conference center . The other restaurant of note is the <unk> Restaurant , located at the harbor . It is the only Chinese restaurant in the country and it uses Greenlandic ingredients cooked in the Chinese style . The town has a heated open @-@ air swimming pool , which is supported on stilts so that the heat does not melt the permafrost . Several camping sites are located in Sisimiut valley and near the Kangerluarsunnguaq bay . During winter , a ski lift operates at the foot of the Alanngorsuaq mountain , at the base of the northern slopes of Nasaasaaq . 
 Tourism is becoming increasingly important , with several outfitter companies based in town . Year @-@ round operations offered include <unk> , heliskiing , guided hiking , mountaineering , kayaking , and boating . The tough , 160 km ( 99 mi ) long Arctic Circle Race takes place each winter , with the trail partially overlapping with the Polar Route from Sisimiut to Kangerlussuaq . The race was inaugurated in 1998 , since then becoming an international competition .

 The Knud Rasmussen High School ( Knud <unk> <unk> ) , founded in 1962 , is located on the eastern outskirts of the town , west of the old heliport site . Apart from the traditional curriculum , it provides specialized courses in Greenland history and culture including skin preparation and ski instruction . The school is also notable for its special unit , the Women 's High School ( Greenlandic : <unk> <unk> ) added in 1977 , and focusing on traditional arts . During summer , the school building is used as a hostel . In autumn 2002 , the school was responsible for erecting a series of stone sculptures around Sisimiut : near the airport , in the municipal building , at the Gertrud Rask Minde children 's home , at <unk> <unk> and around the school itself .

The airport has a short , 799 m ( 2 @,@ 621 ft ) runway suitable only for STOL airplanes . Travel outside of Greenland is routed with a change of planes at Kangerlussuaq Airport . Air Greenland operates scheduled services to Nuuk , Maniitsoq , and Ilulissat . Taxis as well as an infrequent town bus service connect the airport with the center of Sisimiut .

 For most of the year , Sisimiut is served twice @-@ weekly by coastal ferries of Arctic Umiaq Line which link the communities of the western coast .

M / S <unk> , one of the largest ships in the fleet of Royal Greenland , is based in Sisimiut .

 Roads in Sisimiut , including the road to the airport , are surfaced , but there is no road linking Sisimiut to any other settlement . In the 2000s construction of the 170 km ( 110 mi ) road to Kangerlussuaq was discussed for several years without resolution . The road would have been the first of its kind in Greenland , connecting two far @-@ away settlements , and reducing the need for passenger and freight exchange at Kangerlussuaq Airport , the Air Greenland hub . The cost of around € 40M ( € 700 per inhabitant of Greenland ) and € 1M in annual maintenance cost has prevented construction . The town has its own bus network . In winter dog sled routes are used to link to settlements further north . Snowmobiles are , as a more modern approach , also used . Transport within a town is usually done by foot , although both private cars and the city bus - which drives loops through town - are popular .

 = Miniopterus mahafaliensis = 
 Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a bat in the genus Miniopterus that occurs in southwestern Madagascar . Populations of this species have historically been included in Miniopterus manavi , but molecular data published in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this supposed species in fact consists of five separate species , including the newly described M. mahafaliensis . The species has been found in dry , spiny , and gallery forest , as well as more open habitats , in southwestern Madagascar . 
 Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small , brown Miniopterus ; its forearm length is 35 to 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 6 in ) . The hairs of the underparts have gray tips . The tragus ( a projection in the outer ear ) is thick and blunt @-@ tipped . The uropatagium ( tail membrane ) is well @-@ furred and the palate is concave . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 During the 2000s , molecular studies have revealed that the widely distributed African , Eurasian , and Australian genus Miniopterus is much more species @-@ rich than previously thought . In a 1995 contribution to Faune de Madagascar on Malagasy bats , Randolph Peterson and colleagues listed four species of Miniopterus on Madagascar and the nearby Comoros , including the small Miniopterus manavi with a broad distribution on both Madagascar and the Comoros . In 2008 and 2009 , however , Steven Goodman and colleagues presented evidence that the former concept of M. manavi in fact encompassed five morphologically and molecularly distinct species of small Miniopterus . These included M. manavi itself in the Central Highlands , M. griveaudi and M. aelleni in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar , M. brachytragos in northern and western Madagascar only , and M. mahafaliensis in southwestern Madagascar . The five recognized species of M. manavi @-@ like bats are not each other 's closest relatives , but apparently acquired their similarities through convergent evolution . 
 Miniopterus mahafaliensis was described as a new species in the second 2009 paper by Goodman and colleagues . The specific name is derived from the Malagasy word Mahafaly , which refers to the Mahafaly Plateau , where the specimen has been recorded , and to the Mahafaly ethnic group of the region . Analysis of sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene suggested that M. brachytragos is most closely related to another Malagasy species , M. <unk> . Although samples of M. mahafaliensis differed from each other by a maximum of 2 @.@ 2 % in their cytochrome b , Goodman and colleagues could not discern any phylogeographic structure within the species . 
 = = Description = = 
 Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small , short @-@ tailed Miniopterus with long and dense fur . The fur of the upperparts is brown and the hairs on the underparts have gray tips . Miniopterus brachytragos is similar in color , but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker . The ears are partially haired above , but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip . The tragus ( a projection on the inner side of the outer ear ) is relatively thick , has the sides mostly parallel , and ends in a curved , rounded tip . The wing membrane is also brown , but the uropatagium ( tail membrane ) is lighter . The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level , above the ankle . The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs , particularly on the upper side . M. manavi and M. brachytragos also have a densely haired uropatagium , but in M. aelleni and M. griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked . 
 In 66 to 74 specimens measured by Goodman and colleagues , total length was 87 to 96 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 8 in ) , averaging 91 @.@ 1 mm ( 3 @.@ 59 in ) ; tail length was 38 to 48 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 9 in ) , averaging 42 @.@ 4 mm ( 1 @.@ 67 in ) ; hindfoot length is 6 to 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 3 in ) , averaging 6 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 25 in ) ; tragus length was 5 to 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 2 in ) , averaging 5 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 23 in ) ; ear length was 9 to 11 mm ( about 0 @.@ 4 in ) , averaging 9 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 37 in ) ; forearm length was 35 to 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 6 in ) , averaging 37 @.@ 4 mm ( 1 @.@ 47 in ) ; and body mass was 3 @.@ 8 to 7 @.@ 3 g ( 0 @.@ 13 to 0 @.@ 26 oz ) , averaging 4 @.@ 9 g ( 0 @.@ 17 oz ) . There is no evidence for substantial size differences between males and females . 
 In the skull , the rostrum ( front part ) is relatively long and line @-@ shaped . The central groove in the nasal depression is relatively narrow . The frontal bones are slightly rounded and bear a prominent sagittal crest . Further back on the braincase , the lambdoid crest is also prominent . The middle part of the palate is concave , not flat as in M. aelleni and M. manavi . At the palate 's back margin is a long , thin posterior palatal spine . Miniopterus mahafaliensis has 36 teeth in the dental formula 2 @.@ 1 @.@ 2 @.@ 33 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 3 ( three incisors , one canine , three premolars , and two molars in both upper toothrows and two incisors , one canine , two premolars , and three molars in the lower toothrows ) . As is characteristic of Miniopterus , the first upper premolar ( P1 ) is smaller and more simplified than the second ( P2 ) . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 The range of Miniopterus mahafaliensis extends through southwestern Madagascar in the spiny forest and dry forest , often but not always near caves ; it has been found on the Mahafaly Plateau , in the Forêt des Mikea , and the Kirindy Mitea National Park . Further inland , it has been found in disturbed gallery forest in Isalo National Park , in a cave in savanna habitat near <unk> , and in unspecified habitat at Betroka . Little is known of the ecology of M. mahafaliensis , but species of Miniopterus generally feed on insects , breed seasonally , and roost in large colonies in caves . 
 = Acetic acid = 
 Acetic acid / <unk> / , systematically named <unk> acid / <unk> / , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH ( also written as CH3CO2H or <unk> ) . When undiluted , it is sometimes called glacial acetic acid . Vinegar is roughly 3 – 9 % acetic acid by volume , making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water . Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell . In addition to household vinegar , it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate . Although it is classified as a weak acid , concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin . 
 Acetic acid is the second simplest carboxylic acid ( after formic acid ) and consists of two small functional groups , an acetyl group ( sometimes symbolized as Ac ) and a hydroxyl group ( <unk> ) ; it can also be viewed as a methyl group and a carboxyl group linked . It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical , used primarily in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film , polyvinyl acetate for wood glue , and synthetic fibres and fabrics . In households , diluted acetic acid is often used in <unk> agents . In the food industry , acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code <unk> as an acidity regulator and as a condiment . As a food additive it is approved for usage in many countries , including Canada , the European Union , the United States , Australia and New Zealand . In biochemistry , the acetyl group , derived from acetic acid , is fundamental to all forms of life . When bound to coenzyme A , it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats . 
 The global demand for acetic acid is about 6 @.@ 5 million metric tons per year ( Mt / a ) , of which approximately 1 @.@ 5 Mt / a is met by recycling ; the remainder is manufactured from petrochemical feedstock . As a chemical reagent , biological sources of acetic acid are of interest , but generally cannot compete economically . Vinegar is dilute acetic acid , often produced by fermentation and subsequent oxidation of ethanol . 
 = = Nomenclature = = 
 The trivial name acetic acid is the most commonly used and preferred IUPAC name . The systematic name <unk> acid , a valid IUPAC name , is constructed according to the <unk> nomenclature . The name acetic acid derives from <unk> , the Latin word for vinegar , and is related to the word acid itself . 
 Glacial acetic acid is a name for water @-@ free ( anhydrous ) acetic acid . Similar to the German name <unk> ( ice @-@ vinegar ) , the name comes from the ice @-@ like crystals that form slightly below room temperature at 16 @.@ 6 ° C ( 61 @.@ 9 ° F ) ( the presence of 0 @.@ 1 % water lowers its melting point by 0 @.@ 2 ° C ) . 
 A common abbreviation for acetic acid is <unk> , where Ac stands for the acetyl group CH 
 3 − C ( = O ) − . Acetate ( CH 
 <unk> − ) is abbreviated <unk> − . The Ac is not to be confused with the abbreviation for the chemical element actinium . To better reflect its structure , acetic acid is often written as CH 
 3 – C ( O ) OH , CH 
 3 − C ( = O ) OH , CH 
 <unk> , and CH 
 <unk> 
 2H . In the context of acid @-@ base reactions , the abbreviation <unk> is sometimes used , where Ac in this case is a symbol for acetate ( rather than acetyl ) . Acetate is the ion resulting from loss of H + from acetic acid . The name acetate can also refer to a salt containing this anion , or an ester of acetic acid . 
 = = Properties = = 
 = = = Acidity = = = 
 The hydrogen centre in the carboxyl group ( − COOH ) in carboxylic acids such as acetic acid can separate from the molecule by ionization : 
 CH3CO2H → <unk> − + H + 
 Because of this release of the proton ( H + ) , acetic acid has acidic character . Acetic acid is a weak monoprotic acid . In aqueous solution , it has a pKa value of 4 @.@ 76 . Its conjugate base is acetate ( CH3COO − ) . A 1 @.@ 0 M solution ( about the concentration of domestic vinegar ) has a pH of 2 @.@ 4 , indicating that merely 0 @.@ 4 % of the acetic acid molecules are dissociated . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 In solid acetic acid , the molecules form pairs ( dimers ) , being connected by hydrogen bonds . The dimers can also be detected in the vapour at 120 ° C ( 248 ° F ) . <unk> also occur in the liquid phase in dilute solutions in non @-@ hydrogen @-@ bonding solvents , and a certain extent in pure acetic acid , but are disrupted by hydrogen @-@ bonding solvents . The dissociation enthalpy of the dimer is estimated at 65 @.@ 0 – 66 @.@ 0 kJ / mol , and the dissociation entropy at 154 – 157 J mol − 1 K − 1 . Other lower carboxylic acids <unk> in a similar fashion . 
 = = = Solvent properties = = = 
 Liquid acetic acid is a hydrophilic ( polar ) <unk> solvent , similar to ethanol and water . With a moderate relative static permittivity ( dielectric constant ) of 6 @.@ 2 , it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars , but also non @-@ polar compounds such as oils and elements such as sulfur and iodine . It readily mixes with other polar and non @-@ polar solvents such as water , chloroform , and hexane . With higher alkanes ( starting with octane ) , acetic acid is not completely miscible , and its <unk> declines with longer n @-@ alkanes . The solvent and <unk> properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical , for example , as a solvent in the production of dimethyl terephthalate . 
 = = = Biochemistry = = = 
 At physiological pHs , acetic acid is usually fully ionised to acetate . The acetyl group , derived from acetic acid , is fundamental to all forms of life . When bound to coenzyme A , it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats . Unlike longer @-@ chain carboxylic acids ( the fatty acids ) , acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides . However , the artificial triglyceride <unk> ( glycerine triacetate ) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines . 
 Acetic acid is produced and excreted by acetic acid bacteria , notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium <unk> . These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs , water , and soil , and acetic acid is produced naturally as fruits and other foods spoil . Acetic acid is also a component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates , where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent . 
 = = Production = = 
 Acetic acid is produced industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation . About 75 % of acetic acid made for use in the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol , explained below . The biological route accounts for only about 10 % of world production , but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin . As of 2003 – 2005 , total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5 Mt / a ( million tonnes per year ) , approximately half of which was produced in the United States . European production was approximately 1 Mt / a and declining , while Japanese production was 0 @.@ 7 Mt / a . Another 1 @.@ 5 Mt were recycled each year , bringing the total world market to 6 @.@ 5 Mt / a . Since then the global production has increased to 10 @.@ 7 Mt / a ( in 2010 ) , and further ; however , a slowing in this increase in production is predicted . The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals . Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals , Sterling Chemicals , Samsung , Eastman , and Svensk <unk> . 
 = = = Methanol carbonylation = = = 
 Most acetic acid is produced by methanol carbonylation . In this process , methanol and carbon monoxide react to produce acetic acid according to the equation : 
 The process involves <unk> as an intermediate , and occurs in three steps . A catalyst , metal carbonyl , is needed for the carbonylation ( step 2 ) . 
 CH3OH + HI → <unk> + H2O 
 <unk> + CO → <unk> 
 <unk> + H2O → CH3COOH + HI 
 Two related processes for the carbonylation of methanol : the rhodium @-@ catalyzed Monsanto process , and the iridium @-@ catalyzed Cativa process . The latter process is greener and more efficient and has largely supplanted the former process , often in the same production plants . Catalytic amounts of water are used in both processes , but the Cativa process requires less , so the water @-@ gas shift reaction is suppressed , and fewer by @-@ products are formed . 
 By altering the process conditions , acetic anhydride may also be produced on the same plant using the rhodium catalysts . 
 = = = Acetaldehyde oxidation = = = 
 Prior to the commercialization of the Monsanto process , most acetic acid was produced by oxidation of acetaldehyde . This remains the second @-@ most @-@ important manufacturing method , although it is usually not competitive with the carbonylation of methanol . 
 The acetaldehyde may be produced by oxidation of butane or light naphtha , or by hydration of ethylene . When butane or light naphtha is heated with air in the presence of various metal ions , including those of manganese , cobalt , and chromium , peroxides form and then decompose to produce acetic acid according to the chemical equation : 
 2 <unk> + 5 O2 → 4 CH3COOH + 2 H2O 
 The typical reaction is conducted at temperatures and pressures designed to be as hot as possible while still keeping the butane a liquid . Typical reaction conditions are 150 ° C ( 302 ° F ) and 55 atm . Side @-@ products may also form , including <unk> , ethyl acetate , formic acid , and propionic acid . These side @-@ products are also commercially valuable , and the reaction conditions may be altered to produce more of them where needed . However , the separation of acetic acid from these by @-@ products adds to the cost of the process . 
 Under similar conditions and using similar catalysts as are used for butane oxidation , the oxygen in air to produce acetic acid can oxidize acetaldehyde . 
 2 <unk> + O2 → 2 CH3COOH 
 Using modern catalysts , this reaction can have an acetic acid yield greater than 95 % . The major side @-@ products are ethyl acetate , formic acid , and formaldehyde , all of which have lower boiling points than acetic acid and are readily separated by distillation . 
 = = = Ethylene oxidation = = = 
 Acetaldehyde may be prepared from ethylene via the Wacker process , and then oxidised as above . In more recent times , chemical company Showa <unk> , which opened an ethylene oxidation plant in Ōita , Japan , in 1997 , commercialised a cheaper single @-@ stage conversion of ethylene to acetic acid . The process is catalyzed by a palladium metal catalyst supported on a heteropoly acid such as <unk> acid . It is thought to be competitive with methanol carbonylation for smaller plants ( 100 – 250 kt / a ) , depending on the local price of ethylene . The approach will be based on utilizing a novel selective <unk> oxidation technology for the selective oxidation of ethylene and ethane to acetic acid . Unlike traditional oxidation catalysts , the selective oxidation process will use UV light to produce acetic acid at ambient temperatures and pressure . 
 = = = Oxidative fermentation = = = 
 For most of human history , acetic acid bacteria of the genus Acetobacter have made acetic acid , in the form of vinegar . Given sufficient oxygen , these bacteria can produce vinegar from a variety of alcoholic foodstuffs . Commonly used feeds include apple cider , wine , and fermented grain , malt , rice , or potato mashes . The overall chemical reaction facilitated by these bacteria is : 
 <unk> + O2 → CH3COOH + H2O 
 A dilute alcohol solution inoculated with Acetobacter and kept in a warm , airy place will become vinegar over the course of a few months . Industrial vinegar @-@ making methods accelerate this process by improving the supply of oxygen to the bacteria . 
 The first batches of vinegar produced by fermentation probably followed errors in the winemaking process . If must is fermented at too high a temperature , <unk> will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on the grapes . As the demand for vinegar for culinary , medical , and sanitary purposes increased , vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe and ready for processing into wine . This method was slow , however , and not always successful , as the vintners did not understand the process . 
 One of the first modern commercial processes was the " fast method " or " German method " , first practised in Germany in 1823 . In this process , fermentation takes place in a tower packed with wood shavings or charcoal . The alcohol @-@ containing feed is trickled into the top of the tower , and fresh air supplied from the bottom by either natural or forced convection . The improved air supply in this process cut the time to prepare vinegar from months to weeks . 
 Nowadays , most vinegar is made in submerged tank culture , first described in 1949 by Otto <unk> and Heinrich Ebner . In this method , alcohol is fermented to vinegar in a continuously stirred tank , and oxygen is supplied by bubbling air through the solution . Using modern applications of this method , vinegar of 15 % acetic acid can be prepared in only 24 hours in batch process , even 20 % in 60 @-@ hour fed @-@ batch process . 
 = = = Anaerobic fermentation = = = 
 Species of anaerobic bacteria , including members of the genus Clostridium or <unk> can convert sugars to acetic acid directly without creating ethanol as an intermediate . The overall chemical reaction conducted by these bacteria may be represented as : 
 <unk> → 3 CH3COOH 
 These <unk> bacteria produce acetic acid from one @-@ carbon compounds , including methanol , carbon monoxide , or a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen : 
 2 CO2 + 4 H2 → CH3COOH + 2 H2O 
 This ability of Clostridium to metabolize sugars directly , or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs , suggests that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol @-@ oxidizers like Acetobacter . However , Clostridium bacteria are less acid @-@ tolerant than Acetobacter . Even the most acid @-@ tolerant Clostridium strains can produce vinegar in concentrations of only a few per cent , compared to Acetobacter strains that can produce vinegar in concentrations up to 20 % . At present , it remains more cost @-@ effective to produce vinegar using Acetobacter , rather than using Clostridium and concentrating it . As a result , although <unk> bacteria have been known since 1940 , their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications .

 The primary use of acetic acid is the production of vinyl acetate monomer ( <unk> ) . In 2008 , this application was estimated to consume a third of the world 's production of acetic acid . The reaction consists of ethylene and acetic acid with oxygen over a palladium catalyst , conducted in the gas phase . 
 2 H3C − COOH + 2 C2H4 + O2 → 2 H3C − CO − O − CH = CH2 + 2 H2O 
 Vinyl acetate can be <unk> to polyvinyl acetate or other polymers , which are components in paints and adhesives . 
 = = = Ester production = = = 
 The major esters of acetic acid are commonly used as solvents for inks , paints and coatings . The esters include ethyl acetate , n @-@ butyl acetate , isobutyl acetate , and propyl acetate . They are typically produced by catalyzed reaction from acetic acid and the corresponding alcohol : 
 H3C − COOH + HO − R → H3C − CO − O − R + H2O , ( R = a general alkyl group ) 
 Most acetate esters , however , are produced from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction . In addition , ether acetates are used as solvents for nitrocellulose , acrylic lacquers , varnish <unk> , and wood stains . First , glycol <unk> are produced from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol , which are then esterified with acetic acid . The three major products are ethylene glycol <unk> ether acetate ( EEA ) , ethylene glycol <unk> ether acetate ( EBA ) , and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate ( PMA , more commonly known as <unk> in semiconductor manufacturing processes , where it is used as a resist solvent ) . This application consumes about 15 % to 20 % of worldwide acetic acid . Ether acetates , for example EEA , have been shown to be harmful to human reproduction . 
 = = = Acetic anhydride = = = 
 The product of the condensation of two molecules of acetic acid is acetic anhydride . The worldwide production of acetic anhydride is a major application , and uses approximately 25 % to 30 % of the global production of acetic acid . The main process involves dehydration of acetic acid to give <unk> at 700 – 750 ° C. <unk> is thereafter reacted with acetic acid to obtain the anhydride : 
 CH3CO2H → CH2 = C = O + H2O 
 CH3CO2H + CH2 = C = O → ( <unk> ) 2O 
 Acetic anhydride is an acetylation agent . As such , its major application is for cellulose acetate , a synthetic textile also used for photographic film . Acetic anhydride is also a reagent for the production of heroin and other compounds .

 Glacial acetic acid is an excellent polar <unk> solvent , as noted above . It is frequently used as a solvent for recrystallization to purify organic compounds . Acetic acid is used as a solvent in the production of <unk> acid ( TPA ) , the raw material for polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) . In 2006 , about 20 % of acetic acid was used for TPA production . 
 Acetic acid is often used as a solvent for reactions involving <unk> , such as Friedel @-@ Crafts alkylation . For example , one stage in the commercial manufacture of synthetic camphor involves a Wagner @-@ <unk> rearrangement of camphene to <unk> acetate ; here acetic acid acts both as a solvent and as a nucleophile to trap the rearranged <unk> . 
 Glacial acetic acid is used in analytical chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides . Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water , so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium . It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid , such as perchloric acid .

The OH group is the main site of reaction , as illustrated by the conversion of acetic acid to acetyl chloride . Other substitution derivatives include acetic anhydride ; this anhydride is produced by loss of water from two molecules of acetic acid . <unk> of acetic acid can likewise be formed via Fischer esterification , and amides can be formed . When heated above 440 ° C ( 824 ° F ) , acetic acid decomposes to produce carbon dioxide and methane , or to produce <unk> and water :

 = = History = = 
 Vinegar was known early in civilization as the natural result of exposure of beer and wine to air , because acetic acid @-@ producing bacteria are present globally . The use of acetic acid in alchemy extends into the 3rd century BC , when the Greek philosopher Theophrastus described how vinegar acted on metals to produce pigments useful in art , including white lead ( lead carbonate ) and verdigris , a green mixture of copper salts including copper ( II ) acetate . Ancient Romans boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called sapa . Sapa that was produced in lead pots was rich in lead acetate , a sweet substance also called sugar of lead or sugar of Saturn , which contributed to lead poisoning among the Roman aristocracy . 
 In the 16th @-@ century German alchemist Andreas Libavius described the production of acetone from the dry distillation of lead acetate , <unk> decarboxylation . The presence of water in vinegar has such a profound effect on acetic acid 's properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and the acid found in vinegar were two different substances . French chemist Pierre <unk> proved them identical . 
 In 1845 German chemist Hermann Kolbe synthesised acetic acid from inorganic compounds for the first time . This reaction sequence consisted of chlorination of carbon disulfide to carbon tetrachloride , followed by pyrolysis to <unk> and aqueous chlorination to trichloroacetic acid , and concluded with electrolytic reduction to acetic acid . 
 By 1910 , most glacial acetic acid was obtained from the <unk> liquor , a product of the distillation of wood . The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime , and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid . At that time , Germany was producing 10 @,@ 000 tons of glacial acetic acid , around 30 % of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye . 
 Because both methanol and carbon monoxide are commodity raw materials , methanol carbonylation long appeared to be attractive precursors to acetic acid . Henri Dreyfus at British Celanese developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925 . However , a lack of practical materials that could contain the corrosive reaction mixture at the high pressures needed ( 200 atm or more ) discouraged commercialization of these routes . The first commercial methanol carbonylation process , which used a cobalt catalyst , was developed by German chemical company BASF in 1963 . In 1968 , a rhodium @-@ based catalyst ( cis − [ Rh ( CO ) 2I2 ] − ) was discovered that could operate efficiently at lower pressure with almost no by @-@ products . US chemical company Monsanto Company built the first plant using this catalyst in 1970 , and rhodium @-@ catalyzed methanol carbonylation became the dominant method of acetic acid production ( see Monsanto process ) . In the late 1990s , the chemicals company BP Chemicals commercialised the Cativa catalyst ( [ Ir ( CO ) 2I2 ] − ) , which is promoted by iridium for greater efficiency . This iridium @-@ catalyzed Cativa process is greener and more efficient and has largely supplanted the Monsanto process , often in the same production plants .

 Interstellar acetic acid was discovered in 1996 by a team led by David <unk> using the former Berkeley @-@ Illinois @-@ Maryland Association array at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory and the former Millimeter Array located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory . It was first detected in the Sagittarius B2 North molecular cloud ( also known as the Sgr B2 Large Molecule Heimat source ) . Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers ; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes , single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections .

 Concentrated acetic acid is corrosive to skin and must therefore be handled with appropriate care to avoid skin burns , permanent eye damage , and irritation to the mucous membranes . These burns or blisters may not appear until hours after exposure . Latex gloves offer no protection , so specially resistant gloves , such as those made of nitrile rubber , are worn when handling the compound . 
 Prolonged skin contact with glacial acetic acid may result in tissue destruction . Inhalation exposure ( eight hours ) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes , nose , and throat ; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs , eyes , and skin may result . Vapour concentrations of 1 @,@ 000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes , nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated . These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure . Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare , but has occurred . 
 It has been reported that , in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm ( estimated ) , produced symptoms of <unk> irritation , upper respiratory tract irritation , and hyperkeratotic dermatitis . Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes , nose , and throat , with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis . <unk> humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm , and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm has been reported . In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks , the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of the skin of the hands , conjunctivitis ( but no corneal damage ) , bronchitis and pharyngitis , and erosion of the exposed teeth ( incisors and canines ) . 
 The hazards of solutions of acetic acid depend on the concentration . The following table lists the EU classification of acetic acid solutions : 
 Solutions at more than 25 % acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent , corrosive vapour . Dilute acetic acid , in the form of vinegar , is practically harmless . However , ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life . It can cause severe damage to the digestive system , and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood . 
 Due to incompatibilities , it is recommended to keep acetic acid away from chromic acid , ethylene glycol , nitric acid , perchloric acid , <unk> , peroxides and <unk> . 
 Concentrated acetic acid can be ignited only with difficulty in the laboratory , but becomes a flammable risk in ambient temperatures above 39 ° C ( 102 ° F ) , and can form explosive mixtures with air at higher temperatures ( explosive limits : 5 @.@ 4 – 16 % ) . 
 = Moonshine ( Bruno Mars song ) = 
 " Moonshine " is a song recorded by American singer @-@ songwriter Bruno Mars for his second studio album Unorthodox Jukebox ( 2012 ) . It was written by Bruno Mars , Philip Lawrence , Ari Levine , Andrew Wyatt , Jeff Bhasker and Mark Ronson who also served as its producer along with the former three , under their alias , The Smeezingtons , and Bhasker . " Moonshine " is a midtempo dance @-@ pop , power pop and R & B record . In addition to be heavily influenced by quiet storm style and a " disco groove " .

When they returned to the studio they started jamming , while Mars screamed " Moonshine , take us to the stars ! " . 
 The song was released as the second promotional single on November 19 , 2012 . It was set to be issued on contemporary hit radio as the fourth single of the album in Europe and South America , as announced by Brazilian Warner Music Group in their official website . However , it was replaced by " Gorilla " , which had already been released in the United States and Oceania at the time . Commercially , " Moonshine " charted only in South Korea , where it reached number 17 , along with the release of its parent album . It eventually charted in both Belgium charts in 2013 , peaking at number 30 on the Ultratop 50 Flanders and Ultratip Wallonia , a component of the Ultratop 50 Wallonia at number four . On the following year , it debuted in France , spending 11 weeks on the chart , Netherlands and Poland , during the month of January , peaking at number 117 , 32 and 11 , respectively . 
 It received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who compared its composition to the works of Michael Jackson , Prince and Madonna . Musically , the track has a " retro " vibe , which is noted on the " flanged guitar notes " , " moody chord progressions " and " cheesy flecks of synthesizer " . Its lyrics , had different interpretations with some using its <unk> meaning , saying that Mars tries to escape " to ecstasy in a bottle of his favorite vice " , while others took a connotative approach by writing that " Moonshine " is about " longing for the high water mark of a relationship " , which becomes " impossible to reach " . The track was performed on the Moonshine Jungle Tour ( 2013 @-@ 2015 ) as the opening act .

 During an interview , with Rolling Stone , Mars explained the origin of " Moonshine " , by saying " We all [ Mars , Ronson and Bhasker ] went out one night , and they had actual moonshine on the menu . We drank it all night , then headed to the studio – Jeff got on keyboards , Mark starts playing electronic drums that sound like Eighties Prince and I started screaming , ' Moonshine , take us to the stars ! ' There were a lot of nights like that " . 
 " Moonshine " was written by Bruno Mars , Philip Lawrence , Ari Levine , Andrew Wyatt , Jeff Bhasker and Mark Ronson . Mars , Lawrence , and Levine , Bhasker and Ronson were in charge of the production . The song was recorded by Levine , with additional engineering by Charles Moniz . The guitar was played by Wyatt and Ronson , the latter also handled the bass and other beats , while the former contributed with backing vocals along with Bhasker . The lead singer performs the keyboards on the recording . The mixing of the track was done at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood by Manny Marroquin . David Kutch mastered the track . 
 Upon the song lifting , Mars tweeted " Ive been jammin to this song for a while now . I hope <unk> can groove wit me and slide wit me but most important BOK wit me # Moonshine " . " Moonshine " was released digitally as a promotional single in the United States on November 19 , 2012 as part of the iTunes countdown through Atlantic Records . In countries outside of the US it as liberated by Warner Entertainment Group on the same date . On September 16 , 2013 a promotional CD single containing the song was made available by the former label . It was announced on the Brazilian website of Warner Music Group that the track was set to be released on contemporary hit radio as a single on October 25 , 2013 in Europe and South America , while " Gorilla " had been sent to United States and Oceania mainstream radio . Nevertheless , it was replaced by Gorilla as the fourth single . 
 A remix of the song , made by The <unk> ( Alex Schwartz and Joe <unk> ) , was exclusively released as bonus track on the Target edition of the album , on December 11 , 2012 . Almost a year later , on November 5 , 2013 , the remix of the song was also included on the deluxe edition of the album , released worldwide .

 " Moonshine " has a length of three minutes and forty @-@ nine seconds . It has been described as a midtempo dance @-@ pop , power pop , and R & B song . Critics noticed being heavily influenced by quiet storm style and having a " disco groove " , as well as , having a " retro " and " slightly ’ 80s @-@ informed " vibe . Mitchell Peters , while writing the Billboard cover story where Mars was featured , called " Moonshine " a " sexed @-@ up rocker " According to the sheet music published at Music Notes by Alfred Music , the recording is composed in the key of A minor with a time signature in common time , and a moderate groove of 104 beats per minute . Mars 's vocals range spans from the note of C4 to Eb5 . As the track progresses " flanged guitar notes and moody chord progressions " can be heard with " cheesy flecks of synthesizer " . The song <unk> is " amusing Simple Minds @-@ like " and its chorus is similar to ' Heartbeat ' by Don Johnson . A bass guitar , drums and additional beats are also part of its instrumentation . 
 The subject addressed in the recording lyrics has divided the critics , while Spin 's Chris Martins was " slightly disappointed " when he realized that " the song was not , in fact , an ode to bootleg liquor " , but a " longing for the high water mark of a relationship that now seems impossible to reach " , despite the fact that " Mars ’ lyrics intoxicate in their own way " . On the other hand , a writer for Neon Limelight commented that the " Mars croons about escaping to ecstasy in a bottle of his favorite vice " ; using the lyrics on the first verse and the chorus , " Oh moonshine , take us to the stars tonight / Take us to that special place / That place we went the last time , the last time " , as evidence . Pop Crush 's Jessica Sager felt the lyrics subject could be " about alcohol addiction " or " a girl who feels like it " . 
 The recording 's composition brought attention due to its similarities to the works of Michael Jackson . Martins of Spin stated that the track finds Mars channeling " the King of Pop with a markedly more reverent aplomb " . Similarly , Neon Limelight writer , stated that " Bruno Mars channels Michael Jackson in his new single " . The writer furthered that the track was " Built on a very Off The Wall @-@ era , mid @-@ tempo disco groove " . Sam Lansky of Idolator concurred , writing that the artist is channeling " 80 's pop icon : Michael Jackson " . Nevertheless , Lansky discovered a " a little bit of Prince in there " , as well , " but Mars ’ vocals sound eerily like Jacko in his prime " . The song has drawn comparisons to Daft Punk due to its " disco groove " , with Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe calling the it " wistful " and Los Angeles Times ' Mikael Wood called it " conflict @-@ free tune " gritting with " desperation " . Mars said that the primary influence for the track was American musician Prince .

 The song has received generally favorable reviews from critics , who couldn 't help to avoid comparisons between the track and Michael Jackson 's work . Chris Martins of Spin called the recording " ' <unk> ' , stating that was something that " Mars might say " . He also wrote that the track was an " 80 's @-@ informed backing track " . Sam Lanksy of Idolator praised the track , saying " fortunately " the drinking during the recording sections " paid off on the song " since it " is probably our favorite effort from Mars to date " . A reviewer for Neon Limelight believed that Mars " channels Michael Jackson in his intoxicating new single " . Tina <unk> from AXS.com recommended , " Watch the turning point of an 80s movie and listen to " Moonshine " . Perfect match " . Having previously stated " The ' 80s are revisited in " Moonshine " with Mars taking on the sounds and styles of Michael Jackson and Madonna " . Jason Lipshut of Billboard wrote that " The production is so buttery that the listener can 't help but get another sugar rush " . Jessica Sager of Pop Crush opined " echoes and sparse production make this sound similar to a Phil Collins track , but in Mars ’ song , a midtempo beat kicks it into modern gear . 
 In a mixed review , Metro ' Amy Dawson , while reviewing the album , commented that " Moonshine ’ s melodic , mid @-@ tempo disco makes a genuinely decent stab at channelling Michael Jackson " . On the other hand , Jon Caramanica of New York Times called it " melodramatic and spry " , furthering " the song feels bigger than the contours Mr. Mars can give it . It demands a <unk> . It could use Adam Lambert " .

 = Thunderbird 6 = 
 Thunderbird 6 is a 1968 British science @-@ fiction adventure film written by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson , directed by David Lane and produced by Century 21 Cinema . A sequel to 1966 's Thunderbirds Are Go , it was the second film to be adapted from the 1960s television series Thunderbirds , which combined scale models and special effects with marionette puppet characters in a filming process that the Andersons termed " Supermarionation " . Intended to provide a lighter @-@ hearted cinematic experience to contrast with the harder science of Thunderbirds Are Go , the Andersons elected to base the plot of Thunderbird 6 on Skyship One , a futuristic airship that is the latest project of the scientist Brains . 
 Alan , Tin @-@ Tin , Lady Penelope and Parker represent International Rescue on Skyship One 's round @-@ the @-@ world maiden flight , unaware that criminal mastermind the Hood is once again plotting to acquire the secrets of the Thunderbird machines . Paid agents of the Hood murder the original crew of Skyship One prior to take @-@ off and assume their identities , entertaining the guests while scheming to lure the Tracy brothers into a trap . Meanwhile , Brains ' efforts to produce a satisfactory design concept for Jeff 's proposed Thunderbird 6 collide with fate when Skyship One is damaged and Alan 's old Tiger Moth biplane appears to be the only hope of saving the International Rescue group and their impostor hosts . 
 Actors John Carson and Geoffrey Keen provide guest speaking roles , with additions to the regular voice cast in the form of Keith Alexander and Gary Files . The design of the puppets that appear in Thunderbird 6 marks a transition between the caricatures that Century 21 had used up to Thunderbirds Are Go and the realism introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons . Filming ran from May to December 1967 , and the art and special effects departments collaborated to realise Skyship One as both a miniature model and a collection of themed interior designs . A number of sequences of the Tiger Moth in flight were filmed on location with a full @-@ sized stunt plane , but a legal dispute with the Ministry of Transport regarding alleged dangerous flying by pilot Joan Hughes forced the production team to film the remaining shots in @-@ studio with scale replicas . 
 Released in July 1968 , Thunderbird 6 had a mediocre reception at the box office , which ruled out the production of further sequels in the Thunderbirds film series . Critical response has remained mixed : although the special effects have been praised , commentators are divided on the quality of the plotting , which is considered either well @-@ paced and concluding on a note of high action , or confusing and inordinately long , with little visual spectacle to contrast with the dialogue . Nevertheless , Thunderbird 6 is viewed favourably in comparison to Jonathan Frakes ' 2004 film adaptation , receiving praise for the perceived agelessness of its entertainment value . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 2068 , the New World Aircraft Corporation ( NWAC ) provides Brains , the inventor of the Thunderbird machines of the humanitarian International Rescue organisation , with an open brief to design a revolutionary aircraft . Although Brains is ridiculed when he proposes an airship for the 21st century , NWAC accepts his blueprints and builds Skyship One , which will circumnavigate the world on its maiden flight with pre @-@ programmed stopover destinations . Alan , Tin @-@ Tin , Lady Penelope and Parker will represent International Rescue as special guests . Brains , meanwhile , is forced to remain on Tracy Island when Jeff decides that International Rescue requires a Thunderbird 6 . Contracted to design this latest addition to the Thunderbirds fleet with no specification , Brains produces a range of concepts , all of which are rejected by Jeff . 
 Alan and Tin @-@ Tin travel to England in an old de Havilland Tiger Moth biplane and join Penelope and Parker . As Skyship One embarks on its round @-@ the @-@ world voyage , the International Rescue guests are unaware that Captain Foster and the stewards have been murdered and replaced by agents in the pay of the Hood , who is operating under the alias of " Black Phantom " and is based at the disused El Hadim airfield near Casablanca in Morocco . Codenamed " White Ghost " , the impostors are not required to demonstrate technical knowledge of Skyship One since it incorporates automated systems , meaning that the trip passes without incident as the airship visits such locations as New York , the Grand Canyon , Rio de Janeiro and India . 
 Penelope has been warming to the dashing impersonator of Captain Foster , but uncovers a listening device in her room after Skyship One passes through the Egyptian Pyramids . Foster and his associates have secretly been recording and editing Penelope 's speech to assemble a false transmission , which requests that Jeff dispatch Thunderbirds 1 and 2 , with Brains on board , to El Hadim airfield where the Hood and his henchmen will be waiting to hi @-@ jack the machines . When Skyship One makes its final stop in the Swiss Alps , while Foster , Alan , Tin @-@ Tin , and Lady Penelope dine at a steam train themed inn , Parker locates the editing equipment , but the transmission has been finished and is soon sent to John on Thunderbird 5 . Alan determines the threat against International Rescue just in time for Penelope to contact Jeff in person and warn that Thunderbirds 1 and 2 are about to be ambushed . Dispatched by Jeff in accordance with the transmission , Scott and Virgil now open fire on and annihilate the Hood 's hideout . 
 On Skyship One , Alan , Penelope and Parker battle Foster and his associates in a gunfight and kill two of the five White Ghost operatives , but are forced to surrender when Tin @-@ Tin is captured as a hostage . One of the " Gravity <unk> " has also been damaged in the fighting , causing the airship to lose altitude . Crossing the English coast , it crashes into a radio mast at a missile base in Dover . With the airship balanced precariously on top of the mast and its anti @-@ gravity field failing , it is up to Scott , Virgil and Brains to rescue all on board before it collapses onto the base . On Tracy Island , Gordon proposes that Alan 's Tiger Moth , in storage at the NWAC Headquarters , is light enough to land on the airship without precipitating its fall . 
 Brains pilots the plane onto the top deck but is confronted by Foster and his two surviving associates . Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit , Foster intends to abandon the others , but Alan shoots and kills the impostor . The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage , just before Skyship One crashes to the ground and obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction . A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents , but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope . After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished <unk> motorway and an exhaust tower , Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin @-@ Tin , Parker and Brains all unhurt . Back on Tracy Island , Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired , repainted and revamped Tiger Moth , which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft . 
 = = Production = = 
 Despite the unexpected failure of Thunderbirds Are Go on its release in December 1966 , the United Artists distributors authorised a sequel , to be budgeted at £ 300 @,@ 000 . Major production credits were unchanged from the first film : while Gerry and Sylvia Anderson scripted the film in three months and returned as producers , David Lane filled the position of director . 
 The plot of the ill @-@ fated Skyship One was intended to be more light @-@ hearted than that of Zero @-@ X in Thunderbirds Are Go , although at the earliest production stage the focus was to be a " Russo @-@ American space project " . From an idea of Desmond Saunders , a long @-@ standing collaborator who had an interest in aviation , the Andersons @-@ based the plot on the destruction of the British R101 in 1930 . Gerry Anderson researched airship history by reading books on the R101 , the R100 and the Graf Zeppelin . The plot also emulates the Thunderbirds Series Two episode " Alias Mr. <unk> " , which stars another of Brains ' pioneering aircraft , <unk> . 
 Introducing a vintage de Havilland Tiger Moth as the new Thunderbird 6 , in their script the Andersons allude to 1960s publicity for Esso , which advertised under the promotional banner of " Put a Tiger in Your Tank " . A line from Virgil Tracy during the final rescue of the Skyship One occupants adapts this slogan to refer to the " Tiger " stored inside Thunderbird 2 's Pod . However , no character dialogue explicitly refers to the aircraft by the full name " Tiger Moth " . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Voice acting was recorded in six days at the Anvil Films Recording Studio at Denham in Buckinghamshire , where dialogue for Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons would also be recorded . Dialogue for characters returning from Thunderbirds Are Go , such as the Tracy family , Tracy Island 's other residents , Lady Penelope , Parker and the Hood is , with two exceptions , provided by the same actors . Voice actors introduced in Thunderbird 6 are : 
 Keith Alexander as John Tracy and the Narrator . John 's original voice , Ray Barrett , had returned to his native Australia on the completion of Thunderbirds Are Go . Replacing Barrett in this role for Thunderbird 6 , Alexander was also contracted to provide an opening narration , which describes the secrecy of the International Rescue organisation and Tracy Island . Emigrating from Australia in 1965 , Alexander continued his association with the Andersons after Thunderbird 6 , voicing the characters of Sam Loover in Joe 90 ( 1968 ) and Agent Blake in the final Supermarionation series , The Secret Service ( 1969 ) . He also held the regular part of Lieutenant Keith Ford in UFO in the 1970s . 
 Gary Files as " Black Phantom " . While production of Thunderbird 6 progressed , Files , another Australian actor , also provided voices for Captain Scarlet ( 1967 ) , including the recurring character of Captain Magenta . More roles followed , from supporting voices in Joe 90 to the regular part of Matthew Harding in The Secret Service . He recalls that his lines in Thunderbird 6 were intended as a test prior to Captain Scarlet and has fond memories of his casting , stating in an interview , " I was just knocked out to be working with people like Geoffrey Keen , and those other marvellous people involved . " 
 John Carson as the replacement Captain Foster ( " White Ghost " ) . A British actor of television and cinema , Carson 's small @-@ screen credits of the 1960s and 70s include The Saint , Man in a Suitcase , Department S and The Professionals , while his film roles include Plague of the Zombies ( 1966 ) and Taste the Blood of Dracula ( 1970 ) . His appearances in The Troubleshooters attracted the attention of the Andersons . Carson 's delivery of Foster 's lines has led to a mistaken assertion that fellow British actor James Mason was cast for the role . 
 Geoffrey Keen as James Glenn , the New World Aircraft Corporation President . Also known to the Andersons for his role in The Troubleshooters ( as the leading character of Brian Stead ) , stage , television and cinema actor Keen appeared in more than 100 films in his lifetime , including Doctor Zhivago ( 1965 ) , Born Free ( 1966 ) and , with Carson , Taste the Blood of Dracula . Spanning 1977 to 1987 , he portrayed Sir Frederick Gray , the fictional Minister for Defence in the James Bond series , from the films The Spy Who Loved Me to The Living Daylights . 
 Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn suggest that Thunderbird 6 develops the character of Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise . This is argued to be due , in part , to a more mature reading of the character 's lines from Sylvia Anderson , who provided Penelope 's voice from the first episode of the Thunderbirds television series . Archer and Hearn also praise the work of David Graham , particularly his reading of Parker 's dialogue , but note that other regular characters , such as Gordon and John , appear infrequently in the film .

 With the cancellation of Thunderbirds after the six episodes of Series Two , the next small @-@ screen project for AP Films , re @-@ branded as " Century 21 " in December 1966 , would be Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons . This series , which was screened from September 1967 , starred a brand @-@ new generation of Supermarionation puppets sculpted with more realistic proportions than the caricatured marionettes of Thunderbirds . However , in the pre @-@ production stages for Thunderbirds Are Go , it was decided that audiences who had seen Thunderbirds were too accustomed to the older style of puppet for the returning characters to be upgraded to the new design . To maintain continuity , a compromise was made to produce puppets for the second Thunderbirds film which would mix traits from the two Supermarionation generations : although the heads and hands would remain disproportionately large , the marked caricature from the television episodes would be reduced . 
 For guest roles , puppets were mainly recycled from their previous appearances in Thunderbirds Are Go , although the Captain Foster puppet was a new addition . Puppeteer Wanda Webb recalls that Thunderbird 6 maintained a high standard in the appearance of its cast , commenting on a shot which depicts Lady Penelope asleep on board Skyship One , " I had placed the sleeping eyelids in Plasticine and made the eye shadow a little too blue . We ended up re @-@ shooting the whole sequence . " One @-@ use puppets appear in what Supermarionation historian Stephen La Rivière describes as " a contender for the most horrific scene ever produced by Century 21 " : in the opening scene , the characters of the NWAC executives present gaping mouths and teeth , complete with dental fillings , when Brains ' plan to design an airship sends them into howls of laughter . The decision to begin the film with a cold open and delay the title sequence and opening credits was one of Century 21 's efforts to distinguish Thunderbird 6 from the preceding film . 
 = = = Design and effects = = = 
 Principal photography for Thunderbird 6 commenced on 1 May 1967 , by which time Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons had already entered production . One of the Century 21 production units was transferred from Captain Scarlet to the second Thunderbirds film and shooting was completed in four months alongside that of the new television series . Special effects director Derek Meddings constructed the Skyship One model and supervised the creation of scale replicas of destinations explored in the film , such as the Great Sphinx of Giza , the Egyptian Pyramids and the Grand Canyon . The Swiss Alps shots which frame a scene set inside the fictional Whistle Stop Inn called for the FAB1 model to skate across ice , while scale figures of Alan and Tin @-@ Tin follow the Rolls @-@ Royce on skis . The length of movement required necessitated the construction of a special effects set that was between 40 and 50 feet ( 12 and 15 m ) wide ( the largest used for the film ) , filled with salt to simulate the snow @-@ capped Swiss mountains . The film was also shot in parallel with Joe 90 , as evidenced by special effects footage of the destruction of the Dover Missile Complex re @-@ appearing in the pilot episode of that series , and a brief appearance of Sam Loover 's car during the evacuation of the Complex . 
 The art department , headed by Bob Bell and responsible for the interiors of Skyship One , designed each room in a unique style : while the airship 's Ball Room includes spherical @-@ shaped décor , a Games Room is furnished to a dice and chessboards theme . Although Keith Wilson was attached to the production of Captain Scarlet , he contributed the design of Lady Penelope 's bedroom , which is shaded a bright pink to match the colour of FAB1 . In the course of filming , the floor of the Skyship One Bottle Room set ignited under the heat of the studio lights and had to be completely rebuilt . The interior of the Whistle Stop Inn is a favourite of Bell . Shooting on this set had to be carefully timed due to the presence of model trains , of a smaller scale than the puppets , which run on tracks and transport meals to the characters as their " cargo " . In their biography of Gerry Anderson , Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn hold the Skyship One Gravity Compensation Room , in which the Gravity <unk> are represented by rotating metal frames , in high regard . However , Penelope 's bedroom is described as resembling a " Barbara Cartland nightmare " .

 The vintage de Havilland Tiger Moth appears as a scale model for sequences such as Alan and Tin @-@ Tin 's departure from Tracy Island and Brains ' arrival on the top deck of Skyship One . The production team also decided to arrange a live @-@ action location shoot in Buckinghamshire to star a full @-@ sized biplane . Joan Hughes , an experienced pilot who had flown Supermarine Spitfires and Avro Lancasters from factories to airbases during the Second World War , was selected to fly the aircraft . Sequences that comprise live @-@ action filming include Brains launching the Tiger Moth from a field to rescue the occupants of Skyship One , Penelope 's subsequent struggle to control the aircraft , the gun battle with Foster 's remaining henchmen , the near collisions with the motorway bridge and the exhaust tower , and the final crash @-@ landing . For the later sequences , stunt dummies fixed to the Tiger Moth 's wings and undercarriage represent the characters of Alan , Tin @-@ Tin , Parker , Brains and the White Ghost agents , while Hughes doubles for Penelope in the cockpit . The location filming was based at Wycombe Air Park . 
 The M40 motorway , which was nearing completion at the time of production , doubled for the fictitious <unk> . In the run @-@ up to the filming of the plane 's near @-@ miss with the bridge between Junctions 4 and 5 , at Lane End on the High Wycombe Bypass , the Ministry of Transport and the local police ordered that in accordance with Ministry of Civil Aviation regulations , the manoeuvre be performed with the wheels in contact with the tarmac at all times . During a take , a crosswind sprang up and the drag caused by the dummies left Hughes concerned that she would lose control of the Tiger Moth if it were to hit the ground . She therefore kept the plane in mid @-@ air while passing under the bridge , clearing it by nine feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) as originally planned . On another attempt , the continuing adverse conditions necessitated a second low @-@ level glide , angering the Ministry of Transport official supervising the filming ; subsequently , Hughes and production manager were arrested . Hughes , a pilot with more than three decades ' flight experience by 1968 , later commented that this dangerous stunt marked only the first time in her career that she had feared for her safety . 
 Both Hughes and Foster were prosecuted ; the former was charged with seven counts of " dangerous flying " , and the latter with three of aiding and abetting . However , it was not until 18 March 1968 – after production had ended – that the case against them was heard at Aylesbury Crown Court . The jury viewed the final cut of Thunderbird 6 and found both defendants not guilty on 20 March . Reported in the Daily Express below the headline " Under The Bridge Goes Lady Penelope " , the acquittal inspired Foster to remark that the character had " opened the way for much greater realism in filmmaking . " 
 In the intervening months , the Ministry of Transport had withdrawn permission for further stunts to be filmed on the M40 , forcing the production team to resort to alternative methods to complete the Tiger Moth sequences . The special effects department constructed a 1 ⁄ 6 @-@ scale model re @-@ creation , located on the Century 21 outdoor backlot to reduce lighting discrepancies , with radio @-@ controlled miniatures of the Tiger Moth made to replace Hughes ' aircraft . Ranging from six feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) in width to a smaller 1 ⁄ 3 @-@ scale for filming with the puppet characters , the replicas were unreliable and frequently crashed , but Anderson asserts that the production team successfully merged the full @-@ sized and miniature shots so that it is difficult to distinguish which aircraft is piloted by Hughes and which is remote @-@ controlled . The scale reconstruction of the M40 bridge was aligned with a backdrop of real trees and fields to simulate the intended setting as faithfully as possible . Bad weather forced the outdoor filming to run for six weeks . 
 Built at Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire in 1940 , the <unk> Tiger Moth that appears in the film ( registration G @-@ <unk> , serial number <unk> ) had served in the RAF before being sold to the Association of British Aero Clubs in 1953 . Since the production of Thunderbird 6 , the plane has made appearances in other films , such as Michael Apted 's Agatha ( 1978 ) . Damaged in a crash in 1992 , the repaired Tiger Moth currently forms a part of the Diamond Nine aerobatics squadron , based at White Waltham Airfield , Berkshire . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Barry Gray considered the musical score for Thunderbird 6 superior to that of Thunderbirds Are Go since its depiction of round @-@ the @-@ world travel provided scope for a large number of musical themes . Music was recorded in six sessions at the Olympic Studios at Barnes , London , between 1 and 5 February 1968 , with an orchestra of 56 members . The main title music , described as " jaunty " in Gerry Anderson 's biography , accompanies opening credits superimposed on shots of Skyship One as it sits on the NWAC airfield . The soundtrack was released in a limited edition in 2005 . A rendition of the 19th @-@ century song " The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze " accompanies the aerial shots which chart Alan and Tin @-@ Tin 's departure from Tracy Island at the start of the film . Director David Lane wanted the movements of the Tiger Moth to simulate a dance in mid @-@ air , and to this end played the song on loudspeakers from the shooting helicopter to inspire the stunt pilot . 
 = = Release = = 
 Completed in December 1967 and awarded a " U " rating from the British Board of Film Classification on 22 January 1968 , Thunderbird 6 did not premiere until 29 July , at the London Odeon Cinema in Leicester Square . To promote the film , a Lady Penelope impersonator , Penny Snow , toured Britain in a pink Rolls @-@ Royce imitation of FAB1 . Commenting on the six @-@ month postponement between classification and release , Thunderbirds historian Chris Bentley conjectures that United Artists had lost faith in distributing the Thunderbirds franchise in light of the disappointing box office returns for Thunderbirds Are Go , and therefore intentionally shelved the sequel between January and July . 
 = = Reception = = 
 <unk> at the box office on its general release , Thunderbird 6 went on to become a commercial failure and spoilt chances for the production of a potential third Thunderbirds film . In his review published in the Daily Mail , critic Barry Norman described the sequel to Thunderbirds Are Go as child @-@ orientated but still a showcase of " technical excellence " . In what he termed a " class @-@ conscious " side to the film , Norman also discussed the characterisation of Parker , a manservant , as a butt of jokes , such as being the one unfortunate character to find himself stuck upside @-@ down in a tree as the Tiger Moth crash @-@ lands . 
 La Rivière theorises that the commercial failure of the film is attributable to the facts that ITC financier Lew Grade had cancelled Thunderbirds as a television series in 1966 , and that , by July 1968 , 18 months had passed since the screening of the final episode ( " Give or Take a Million " ) , resulting in a loss of public interest in the franchise . He praises Thunderbird 6 for its visual work , and holds the model Tiger Moth effects in particularly high regard , writing that it represents " some of the best effects work Century 21 would ever create . It is a testament to their skill and ingenuity that , in the motorway sequence , the model shots are indistinguishable from the original . " However , he questions whether the sparseness of the action sequences is a disappointment to child viewers , suggesting that the film " feels like an extended puppet version of holiday magazine programme Wish You Were Here ... ? " Adding to the " unfamiliar air " of the film are the characters , who La Rivière argues sound more mature than before in a development which he partly attributes to the new casting of Gary Files and Keith Alexander . He also asserts that the film intentionally avoids iconic elements from the original Thunderbirds episodes , such as the Thunderbird launch sequences and the " Thunderbirds March " theme music . 
 La Rivière argues that the use of the Tiger Moth as the star vehicle , and the pun on the Esso promotional banner of " Put a Tiger in Your Tank " , are more suited to an adult audience . Meanwhile , children " had spent the entire 90 minutes eagerly waiting for the most fantastic piece of hardware to arrive . They got an old plane . " Thunderbirds historian John Marriott voices similar criticism of the Tiger Moth , writing that " the big screen was an unsuitable place for the gentle irony of steam @-@ age technology scoring triumphantly over an array of fantasy machines . " Science @-@ fiction author John Peel is dismissive of the film in general and compares it pessimistically to the " well @-@ made fun " of Thunderbirds Are Go . He summarises it as a " big mistake " and " a feeble last fling for a brilliant series " , with a long and illogical plot , poor jokes and little action during the final rescue sequences . Responding to claims that the tone of Thunderbird 6 differs significantly from that of its predecessor , Gerry Anderson maintains that the time that had elapsed since the airing of the final television episode meant that " we were much more aware with the second one that it wasn 't just a question of making a longer episode , but it was , indeed , to make something special for the cinema . " 
 A BBC Online review suggests that the sequel to Thunderbirds Are Go is " a weak and perhaps too padded adventure " which is an underwhelming experience as a feature @-@ length film . Despite summarising it as having more " the extended feel of a special TV episode " , and describing the plot as substandard in comparison to the original episodes , Thunderbird 6 is awarded a rating of three out of five stars . In contrast , Jim Schembri of Australian newspaper The Age asserts that the plotting is strong ( and superior to that of Thunderbirds Are Go ) , and that the film also boasts " a snappier pace , with an action climax leaps ahead of anything in the latest Bond epic . " Writing in the same newspaper , Philippa Hawker notes an increase in humour , stating of Thunderbird 6 that it is " more self @-@ consciously light @-@ hearted but it 's also more suspenseful . " The Film4 website offers a three @-@ star rating to match BBC Online , praising the production team 's decision to introduce more naturally proportioned puppets and comparing Thunderbird 6 favourably to Jonathan Frakes 's 2004 adaptation , which is considered a " live @-@ action bomb " . Described as " great fun " and " entertaining if antiquated " , the film is also referred to as " a slice of kid @-@ friendly cinema made for a far more innocent age . "

 = Poetry of Maya Angelou = 
 Maya Angelou , an African @-@ American writer who is best known for her seven autobiographies , was also a prolific and successful poet . She has been called " the black woman 's poet laureate " , and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans . Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age , and used poetry and other great literature to cope with trauma , as she described in her first and most well @-@ known autobiography , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings . She became a poet after a series of occupations as a young adult , including as a cast member of a European tour of Porgy and Bess , and a performer of calypso music in nightclubs in the 1950s . Many of the songs she wrote during that period later found their way to her later poetry collections . She eventually gave up performing for a writing career . 
 Despite considering herself a poet and playwright , she wrote Caged Bird in 1969 , which brought her international recognition and acclaim . Many of her readers consider her a poet first and an autobiographer second , but she is better known for her prose works . She has published several volumes of poetry , and has experienced similar success as a poet . Early in her writing career , she began alternating a volume of poetry with an autobiography . Her first volume of poetry , Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie ( 1971 ) , was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize . In 1993 , she recited one of her best @-@ known poems , " On the Pulse of Morning " , at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton . 
 Angelou explores many of the same themes throughout all her writings , in both her autobiographies and poetry . These themes include love , painful loss , music , discrimination and racism , and struggle . Her poetry cannot easily be placed in categories of themes or techniques . It has been compared with music and musical forms , especially the blues , and like the blues singer , Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations , sadness , and great suffering . Many of her poems are about love , relationships , or overcoming hardships , as expressed in poems of hers such as " Still I Rise " , I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings , and Million Man March Poem . The metaphors in her poetry serve as " coding " , or litotes , for meanings understood by other Blacks , but her themes and topics apply universally to all races . Angelou uses everyday language , the Black vernacular , Black music and forms , and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language , the occasional use of profanity , and traditionally unacceptable subjects . As she does throughout her autobiographies , Angelou speaks not only for herself , but for her entire gender and race . Her poems continue the themes of mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies , and inject hope through humor . Tied with Angelou 's theme of racism is her treatment of the struggle and hardships experienced by her race . 
 Many critics consider Angelou 's autobiographies more important than her poetry . Although her books have been best @-@ sellers , her poetry has been studied less . Angelou 's lack of critical acclaim has been attributed to her popular success and to critics ' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a spoken , performed one . 
 = = Background = = 
 Maya Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age , having " fallen in love with poetry in Stamps , Arkansas " , where she grew up and the setting of her first autobiography , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ( 1969 ) . At the age of eight , she was raped , as recounted in Caged Bird . She dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature , including poetry , which helped bring her out of her self @-@ imposed muteness . According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout , literature also affects Angelou 's sensibilities as the poet and writer she becomes , especially the " liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon " . 
 As a young adult , Angelou , who preferred to be called Maya because her brother had called her that when she was a child , had a series of jobs and occupations , achieving modest success as a singer , dancer , and performer . She was a cast member of a European tour of Porgy and Bess in 1954 and 1955 and was a cabaret singer in nightclubs in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas throughout the 1950s . While performing at the Purple Onion in San Francisco , due to the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters , she changed her name from Rita Johnson to Maya Angelou , a " distinctive name " that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances . In 1957 , Angelou recorded her first album , Miss Calypso , which captured her focus on calypso music , popular at the time , and her years as a nightclub performer . As she described in her fourth autobiography , The Heart of a Woman ( 1981 ) , Angelou eventually gave up performing for a writing career , although music remained an important aspect of her poetry . In the late 1980s , she returned to music . In 1988 , she co @-@ wrote a song with Roberta Flack , " And So It Goes " , which appeared on Flack 's album Oasis . Angelou collaborated with R & B artists Ashford & Simpson on seven of the eleven tracks of their 1996 album Been Found . The album was responsible for three of Angelou 's only Billboard chart appearances . In 2007 , she and jazz musician Wynton Marsalis wrote " Music , Deep Rivers in My Soul " , which traces the history of African @-@ American music . Angelou was also a fan of country music , and had written several songs . 
 Angelou recorded two albums of poetry and songs written during her time as a night club performer ; the first in 1957 for Liberty Records and the second , " The Poetry of Maya Angelou " , for GWP Records the year before the publication of Caged Bird . They were later incorporated into her volumes of poetry . Despite considering herself a playwright and poet when her editor Robert Loomis challenged her to write Caged Bird — which brought her international recognition and acclaim — she has been best known for her seven autobiographies . Through the writing of her autobiography , Angelou became one of the first African American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life and was recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for blacks and women . It made her " without a doubt , ... America 's most visible black woman autobiographer " , and " a major autobiographical voice of the time " . 
 Beginning with Caged Bird , Angelou used the same " writing ritual " for many years . She woke early in the morning and checked into a hotel room , where the staff was instructed to remove any pictures from the walls . She wrote on legal pads while lying on the bed , with only a bottle of sherry , a deck of cards to play solitaire , Roget 's Thesaurus , and the Bible , and left by the early afternoon . She averaged ten to twelve pages of written material a day , which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening . She composed all her works this way , both prose and poetry . 
 = = Poetry = = 
 Angelou has been a prolific poet , and has published several volumes of poetry , many of which have been best @-@ sellers . She has experienced similar success as a poet as she did as an autobiographer . She began , early in her writing career , of alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry . Her first volume of poetry , Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie , published in 1971 shortly after Caged Bird , became a best @-@ seller and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize . Many of the poems in Diiie were songs that Angelou had previously performed and recorded . In 1994 , her publisher , Random House , placed this volume and her following four volumes of poetry in The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou . Random House has also published several more volumes of Angelou 's poetry , as well as stand @-@ alone publications of single poems . 
 Angelou recited her most famous poem , " On the Pulse of Morning " , at President Bill Clinton 's inauguration in 1993 . In 1995 , she delivered what Richard Long called her " second ' public ' poem " , entitled " A Brave and Startling Truth " , which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations . Also in 1995 , she was chosen to recite one of her poems at the Million Man March . Angelou was the first African @-@ American woman and living poet selected by Sterling Publishing , who placed 25 of her poems in a volume of their Poetry for Young People series in 2004 . In 2009 , Angelou wrote " We Had Him " , a poem about Michael Jackson , which was read by Queen Latifah at his funeral . She wrote " His Day is Done " , a poem honoring Nelson Mandela after his death in 2013 . The poem was released in book form , along with a video of Angelou reciting it , by the U.S. State Department .

 = = Themes = = 
 = = = General themes = = = 
 Angelou explores many of the same themes throughout all her writings , in both her autobiographies and poetry . These themes include love , painful loss , music , discrimination and racism , and struggle . According to DeGout , Angelou 's poetry cannot easily be placed in categories of themes or techniques . 
 Angelou sometimes pairs poems together in her collections to strengthen her themes , something she does , for example , throughout her second volume Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well ( 1975 ) . Many of her poems , especially those in Oh Pray , contain universal identifications with ordinary objects . She uses familiar and feminine metaphors , many of the same themes also found in blues songs , and the dialect of African Americans to express universal themes applicable to all races . Angelou uses rhyme and repetition , which critic Lyman B. Hagen calls " rather ordinary and unimaginative " throughout all her works , both prose and poetry , yet rhyme is found in only seven of the thirty @-@ eight poems in her first volume , Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie . Librarian John Alfred Avant states that many of Angelou 's poems could be set to music like that of jazz singer and musician Nina Simone . For example , " They Went Home " in Diiie was originally written as song lyrics . 
 Angelou 's poems have been compared to music and musical forms . The poems in her fourth volume , Shaker , Why Don 't You Sing ? ( 1983 ) , have been compared to the music of French singer Édith Piaf . In her review of Shaker , Janet Blundell finds the best poems in the volume to be the ones that are structured like blues music . Critic Harold Bloom compares " Times @-@ Square @-@ Shoeshine @-@ Composition " in Diiie to Langston Hughes ' blues / protest poetry . He suggests that the best way to analyze the subjects , style , themes , and use of vernacular in this and most of Angelou 's poems is to use " a blues @-@ based model " , since like the blues singer , Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations , sadness , and great suffering . Blundell , in her review of Angelou 's third volume And Still I Rise ( 1978 ) in Library Journal , finds Angelou 's poems which mimic speech patterns and songs the most effective . However , she finds Angelou 's other poems " mired in hackneyed metaphor and forced rhyme " . 
 Many of Angelou 's poems are about love and relationships . For example , all the poems in the first section of Diiie focus on love . In Southern Women Writers , Carol A. Neubauer states that they " describe the whole gamut of love , from the first moment of passionate discovery to the first suspicion of painful loss " . Over half the poems in Shaker focus on love ( specifically its inevitable loss ) and doomed relationships . 
 Critic William Sylvester states that the metaphors in Angelou 's poetry serve as " coding " , or litotes , for meanings understood by other Blacks . In her poem " Sepia Fashion Show " in Diiie , for example , the last lines ( " I 'd remind them please , look at those knees / you got a Miss Ann 's scrubbing " ) is a reference to slavery , when Black women had to show their knees to prove how hard they had cleaned . Sylvester states that Angelou uses this technique often in her poetry , and that it elicits a change in the reader 's emotions ; in this poem , from humor to anger . Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in " Letter to an Aspiring Junkie " , also in Diiie , in which the understatement contained in the repeated phrase " nothing happens " is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society . Hagen calls Angelou 's coding " signifying " and states , " A knowledge of black linguistic regionalisms and folklore enhances the appreciation of Angelou 's poems " . Hagen believes that despite the signifying that occurs in many of Angelou 's poems , the themes and topics are universal enough that all readers would understand and appreciate them . DeGout states that Angelou conveys meaning through literary imagery , denser vocabulary , and poetic techniques such as <unk> , ambiguity , and anthropomorphism . Angelou 's use of language frees her readers from their traditional perceptions and beliefs about human experience . She uses everyday language , the Black vernacular , Black music and forms , and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language , the occasional use of profanity , and traditionally unacceptable subjects . DeGout says that although this use of language is not the main technique she uses in her poetry , it appears in her more popular poems . 
 = = = Racism / liberation = = = 
 As she does throughout her autobiographies , Angelou speaks not only for herself , but for her entire gender and race . Her poems continue the themes of mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies , and inject hope through humor . Many of Angelou 's poems are personal in nature , especially those in Diiie and Oh Pray , but the theme of racism and connected to it , liberation , is present in her poems and autobiographies . According to DeGout , " a particular gift of the Angelou muse is the translation of personal experience into political discourse " . Scholar Kathy M. Essick calls most of the poems in Diiie Angelou 's " protest poems " . The poems in the second section of Diiie , for example , are militant in tone ; according to Hagen , the poems in this section have " more bite " than the ones in the first section and express the experience of being Black in a white @-@ dominated world . DeGout states , however , that Angelou 's poems have levels of meaning , and that poems in the volume 's first section present the themes of racism , women 's power , and liberation more subtly . DeGout views " A Zorro Man " as an example of Angelou 's ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse and the textured liberation she places in all her poetry . Many of Angelou 's poems , especially those in Diiie , focus on women 's sexual and romantic experiences , but challenge the gender codes of poetry written in previous eras . She also challenges the male @-@ centered and militaristic themes and messages found in the poetry of the Black Arts movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s , leading up to the publication of Diiie . DeGout cites " The Couple " , which appears in Oh Pray , as another example of Angelou 's strategy of combining liberation ideology and poetic techniques . 
 According to Bloom , the themes in Angelou 's poetry are common in the lives of many American Blacks . Angelou 's poems commend the survivors who have prevailed despite racism , difficulty , and challenges . Neubauer states that Angelou focuses on the lives of African Americans from the time of slavery to the 1960s , and that her themes " deal broadly with the painful anguish suffered by blacks forced into submission , with guilt over accepting too much , and with protest and basic survival " . 
 Critic Robert B. Stepto states that the poem " One More Round " , in And Still I Rise is heavily influenced by the work and protest songs of the past . The even @-@ number stanzas in the eight @-@ stanza poem create a refrain like those found in many work songs and are variations of many protest poems . Stepto is impressed with Angelou 's creation of a new art form out of work and protest forms , but does not feel that she develops it enough . He places Angelou 's work in the tradition of other Black poets , and compares the poems in And Still I Rise to the works of Langston Hughes , Gwendolyn Brooks , and Sterling Brown . Stepto also praises Angelou for borrowing " various folk rhythms and forms and thereby buttresses her poems by evoking aspects of a culture 's written and unwritten heritage " . Despite Angelou 's strong criticism of racism , she also asserted in all her writings what Hagen calls a recurring theme , that " we are more alike than unalike " . 
 = = = Struggle = = = 
 Tied with Angelou 's theme of racism is her treatment of the struggle and hardships experienced by her race . Neubauer analyzes two poems in Diiie , " Times @-@ Square @-@ Shoeshine @-@ Composition " and " Harlem Hopscotch " , that support her assertion that for Angelou , " conditions must improve for the black race " . Neubauer states , " Both [ poems ] ring with a lively , invincible beat that carries defeated figures into at least momentary triumph " . In " Times @-@ Squares " , the narrator of the poem , a shoeshiner , takes on the role of the trickster , a common character in Black folklore . He retains his pride despite the humiliation he experiences in his occupation . " Harlem Hopscotch " celebrates survival and the strength , resilience , and energy necessary to accomplish it . Neubauer states , " These poems are the poet 's own defense against the incredible odds in the game of life " . According to DeGout , Angelou creates " a community of healing " for her readers , many of whom have experienced the same trauma and pain as the subjects of her poems . DeGout calls the technique " part of the blues mode in the Angelou canon " , and considers Angelou 's work as a precursor to the Black women writers of the 1970s , who used poetry to express liberation ideology and empowerment . 
 Neubauer asserts that the themes in the poems in And Still I Rise , as the title of the volume suggests , focus on a hopeful determination to rise above difficulty and discouragement . Neubauer states , " These poems are inspired and spoken by a confident voice of strength that recognizes its own power and will no longer be pushed into passivity " . In Angelou 's favorite poem , " Still I Rise " , which has been compared with spirituals that express hope , she refers to the indomitable spirit of Black people . Despite adversity and racism , Angelou expresses her faith that one will overcome and triumph . 
 Like her previous poetry collections , Angelou 's fourth volume , Shaker , Why Don 't You Sing ? , celebrates the ability to survive despite threatened freedom , lost love , and defeated dreams . Neubauer states that the poems in this volume are full of " the control and confidence that have become characteristic of Angelou 's work in general " . Their tone moves from themes of strength to humor and satire , and captures both the loneliness of lovers and the sacrifice that many slaves experienced without succumbing to defeat or despair . The poems in Shaker emphasize determination despite the " <unk> anguish over the oppression of the black race " , and deal with the cruel treatment of slaves in the South . 
 = = Critical reception and response = = 
 Many critics consider Angelou 's autobiographies to be more important than her poetry , including William Sylvester , who states that although Angelou 's books have been best @-@ sellers , her poetry has not been perceived as seriously as her prose . Despite her popular and critical acclaim garnered by her autobiographies , her poetry has been understudied , even after her recitation of " On the Pulse of Morning " in 1993 . Like many reviewers of Angelou 's poetry , Ellen Lippmann in her review of And Still I Rise in School Library Journal finds Angelou 's prose stronger than her poetry , but found her strength more apparent in the poems in this volume than in Caged Bird . In his negative review of And Still I Rise , Stepto expresses disbelief that Angelou 's poems would be produced by a major publishing house while poetry written by other lesser @-@ known talents could not . He explains her popularity as a poet with her autobiographies , which he calls " marvelous " and the real reason for her success as a poet . He states that her poetry serves as explanatory texts for her prose works , which he calls " more adeptly rendered self @-@ portraits " . 
 Despite these reviews , many of Angelou 's readers identify her as a poet first and an autobiographer second . Reviewer Elsie B. Washington has called her " the black woman 's poet laureate " , and has called Angelou 's poetry the anthems of African Americans . African @-@ American literature scholar Lynn Z. Bloom believes that Angelou 's poetry is more interesting when she recites them . He considers her performances dynamic , and says that Angelou " moves exuberantly , vigorously to reinforce the rhythms of the lines , the tone of the words . Her singing and dancing and electrifying stage presence transcend the predictable words and phrases " . 
 Critic Mary Jane Lupton states that " Angelou 's ultimate greatness will be attributed " to her most well @-@ known poem , " On the Pulse of Morning " , and that Angelou 's " theatrical " performance of it , using skills she learned as an actor and speaker , marks a return to the African @-@ American oral tradition of speakers such as Frederick Douglass , Martin Luther King , Jr. and Malcolm X. Angelou was the first poet to read an inaugural poem since Robert Frost at the 1961 inauguration of President John F. Kennedy , and the first Black and woman . Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works , and broadened her appeal " across racial , economic , and educational boundaries " . 
 Gillespie states that Angelou 's poems " reflect the richness and subtlety of Black speech and sensibilities " and were meant to be read aloud . Angelou has supported Gillespie , telling an interviewer in 1983 that she wrote poetry so that it would be read aloud . Critic Harold Bloom , although he calls Angelou 's poetry " popular poetry " and states that it " makes no formal or cognitive demands upon the reader " , compares her poems to musical forms such as country music and ballads . He characterizes her poems as having a social rather than aesthetic function , " particularly in an era totally dominated by visual media " . Sylvester , who says that Angelou " has an uncanny ability to capture the sound of a voice on a page " , places her poems , especially the ones in Diiie , in the " background of black rhythms " . Chad Walsh , reviewing Diiie in Book World , calls Angelou 's poems " a moving blend of lyricism and harsh social observation " . Jessica Letkemann , writing for Billboard , traced the musical qualities of Angelou 's poems to her experience as a singer and musician , and said that they were " full of rhythm , melody , cadence <unk> her powerful words " . 
 Scholar Zofia Burr , who calls Angelou 's poetry " unabashedly public in its ambitions " , connects Angelou 's lack of critical acclaim to both the public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou 's popular success , and to critics ' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal , performed one . Bloom agrees , stating that Angelou 's acclaim has been public rather than critical . Critic James Finn Cotter , in his review of Oh Pray , calls it an " unfortunate example of the dangers of success " and states that Angelou 's fame has " muted the private and personal quality that it takes to be essential to poetry " . Critic John Alfred Avant , despite the fact that the volume was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize , states that Diiie " isn 't accomplished , not by any means " . Even critics who value poetry as an oral tradition devalue Angelou 's poetry ; critic Bryan D. Bourn , who praises her for using African oral tradition , states that she " slips into banality when she abandons " them and criticizes her for not catering to poetry critics . Scholar Joanne Braxton asserts that " Angelou 's audience , composed largely of women and blacks , isn 't really affected by what white and / or male critics of the dominant literary tradition have to say about her work . This audience does not read literary critics ; it does read Maya Angelou " . Burr condemns Angelou 's critics for their narrow view of poetry , which has resulted in their negative reviews of her poetry , and for not taking into account Angelou 's larger purposes in her writing : " to be representative rather than individual , authoritative rather than confessional " . 
 Angelou was an inspiration to the modern hip @-@ hop community . Artists such as Danny Brown , Lupe Fiasco , Jean Grae , and The Roots mention her in their songs . Tupac Shakur , who appeared in the film Poetic Justice , which featured Angelou 's poetry , named his album Still I Rise , released in 1999 after his death , for Angelou 's poem . Nicki Minaj wrote a song also called " Still I Rise " , for her 2009 mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty . Although Minaj 's song does not mention Angelou explicitly , its themes of overcoming hardship echo the themes in Angelou 's poem . Angelou inspired the work of Kanye West , who has referenced Angelou throughout his career , including in a remix of Talib Kweli 's " Get By " , which West produced in 2002 , and in his own song , " Hey Mama " from the album Late Registration , produced in 2005 . Common collaborated with Angelou in 2011 in his song , " The Dreamer " , which featured her reciting a poem at the end of the song . Angelou admitted later that his use of profanity in the song " surprised and disappointed " her . According to Time , Angelou believed that rap music was an avenue for young people to discover poetry , and that she was optimistic about the future of poetry , telling one of its reporters , " “ All I have to do is listen to hip @-@ hop or some of the rappers " .

 Zachary M. Bogosian ( Armenian : <unk> <unk> . <unk> , born July 15 , 1990 ) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman currently playing for the Buffalo Sabres . Bogosian attended Cushing Academy in Massachusetts before he joined the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) in 2006 . He played two seasons in the OHL , and was nominated for the Red Tilson Trophy as the league 's most outstanding player in his second season . Bogosian was regarded as a complete , physical defenseman who could contribute on both offense and defense ; he was rated as one of the top players heading into the 2008 NHL Entry Draft , where the Atlanta Thrashers selected him third overall . He signed a contract with the team a few weeks after the draft and began the season with the Thrashers , though he missed several weeks of his rookie year due to injury . In his second season , he tied a team record for goals by a defenseman . Bogosian first played in an international tournament when he joined the American national team at the 2009 IIHF World Championship .

 = = = Junior = = = 
 In 2004 , Bogosian entered high school at Cushing Academy , a prep school in Massachusetts . The assistant coach of the school 's hockey team was Ray Bourque , a former NHL defenseman who was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame . Bogosian 's teammates at Cushing included his older brother , Aaron , and Bourque 's son , Ryan . While at Cushing he was used mostly as a fifth or sixth defenseman and played few minutes as a result . After his second year at the school , Bogosian was selected 19th overall in the 2006 Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) Priority Draft by the Peterborough Petes Bogosian 's decision to play in the OHL rather than go to the NCAA differed from most of his teammates , including his brother . As his father and uncle had also played college football in the NCAA , it was expected that Bogosian would follow them in going to university . He cited watching Ottawa 67 's games at age nine as a major influence in deciding to play in Canada . 
 Bogosian began playing for the Petes in the 2006 – 07 season . He played 67 games for the team and finished with 7 goals and 26 assists for 33 points , which was second on the team in points for both rookies and defensemen . In recognition of his season , he was named to the OHL 's Second All @-@ Rookie Team , as one of the top four rookie defensemen in the league . The next season , Bogosian appeared in 60 games for the Petes . He led his team in scoring with 61 points ( 11 goals , 50 assists ) , the only defenseman in the league do so ; the 50 assists he scored were second in the league among defensemen . The Petes reached the playoffs after missing the previous year , and Bogosian added another three assists in five games . During the season , he participated in both the OHL All @-@ Star Classic and the CHL Top Prospects Game , an all @-@ star game of prospects from the three leagues in the Canadian Hockey League ( Western Hockey League , Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and OHL ) . At the conclusion of the season , Bogosian was named one of the five draft @-@ eligible finalists for the Red Tilson Trophy as most outstanding player in the OHL , and was also named to the OHL First All @-@ Star Team as one of the two best defensemen in the league . 
 Prior to the 2008 NHL Entry Draft , Bogosian was ranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau as the second best North American skater for the draft and the third ranked prospect out of the OHL . He was drafted third overall by the Atlanta Thrashers behind Steven Stamkos and Drew Doughty . He was noted by his coach in Peterborough , Vince <unk> , to be a " very physical defenseman who is a complete player " and defensively solid who could skate well with the puck and not lose speed . Thrashers general manager Don Waddell liked the physical aspect Bogosian brought to a game , as well as his ability to help score goals while at the same time stop other teams ' top players . Bogosian had been noted prior for the draft for his dedication to training , as he drove more than 90 minutes to Ottawa to get a better work out . 
 = = = Professional = = = 
 In July 2008 , Bogosian attended the Thrashers prospect development camp . The youngest player of the 32 at the camp , he stood out as one of the best players there and effectively assured himself a roster spot on the team . On September 4 , 2008 , Bogosian signed a three @-@ year , entry @-@ level contract worth $ 2 @.@ 625 million with the Thrashers . He was named to the team 's opening day lineup , and made his NHL debut in the first game of the season on October 10 against the Washington Capitals . Bogosian became the youngest person to play for the Thrashers that night at 18 years and 87 days , surpassing Ilya Kovalchuk ( 18 years , 172 days ) . Twenty @-@ four seconds into his first shift , Bogosian was called for a holding penalty , while later in the contest , he had a fight with Capitals enforcer Donald Brashear . Eight games into the season , however , on October 28 , Bogosian broke his left leg in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers . Prior to rejoining the Thrashers , Bogosian was sent to their American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Chicago Wolves , for conditioning . After playing five games with the Wolves , including scoring his first professional goal on January 3 , 2009 , against the Rockford IceHogs , Bogosian rejoined the Thrashers for the remainder of the season . He scored his first NHL goal and recorded his first assist in his twelfth game on January 17 , 2009 , against Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators . Bogosian finished his first professional season with 19 points in 47 NHL games and 1 goal in 5 AHL games as the Thrashers finished out of the playoffs . 
 Throughout the 2009 – 10 season Bogosian was bothered by an injury . During a game against the Ottawa Senators on October 31 , 2009 , Bogosian fell behind his team 's net ; with his left hand lying on the net 's iron frame along the ice , another player fell on top of him . The impact broke his left thumb and injured his wrist . Though he did not miss any time from the injury , it had an effect on his offensive play ; Bogosian was perceived to be more hesitant with the puck , choosing to pass it more often than shooting . In the first 17 games of the season , he had scored 8 goals , then went 29 contests without scoring . In the final 64 games , he only scored 2 goals . After he recovered , Bogosian admitted he did not play at his full capacity , but had decided not to disclose the injury to the team until the season finished in April 2010 . Regardless of his injury , Bogosian only missed one game throughout the season , a game on March 14 against the Phoenix Coyotes . Even with these setbacks , Bogosian set career highs for games played ( 81 ) , goals ( 10 ) , assists ( 13 ) and points ( 23 ) . The 10 goals he scored tied a team record for most by a defenseman in a season , first set by Yannick Tremblay in 1999 – 2000 , the Thrashers ' inaugural year . He also set a team record with 196 hits . Again the Thrashers missed the playoffs . After the Atlanta Thrashers were sold to True North Sports & Entertainment and were relocated to Winnipeg , Bogosian agreed to terms on a new two @-@ year , $ 5 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets on September 14 , 2011 . 
 During the 2014 – 15 season , his seventh with the Thrashers / Jets franchise , Bogosian was traded alongside Evander Kane and the rights to Jason <unk> , to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Tyler Myers , Drew Stafford , two prospects and a conditional first @-@ round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft .

 Bogosian made his international debut with the American national team at the 2009 IIHF World Championship in Switzerland . He appeared in all nine games for the team , and recorded one assist , in a game against France , as the Americans finished fourth overall . During the 2009 – 10 season he was mentioned as a candidate to join the American team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , but a wrist and thumb injury led to a decrease in performance and he was ultimately not selected . He was invited to join the American team at the 2010 IIHF World Championship , but declined in order to heal his injuries .

 = Leonhard Euler = 
 Leonhard Euler ( / <unk> / OY @-@ <unk> ; Swiss Standard German [ <unk> ] , German Standard German [ <unk> ] ) ( 15 April 1707 – 18 September 1783 ) was a Swiss mathematician , physicist , astronomer , logician and engineer who made important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics like infinitesimal calculus and graph theory while also making pioneering contributions to several branches such as topology and analytic number theory . He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation , particularly for mathematical analysis , such as the notion of a mathematical function . He is also known for his work in mechanics , fluid dynamics , optics , astronomy , and music theory . 
 Euler was one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 18th century , and is held to be one of the greatest in history . He is also widely considered to be the most prolific mathematician of all time . His collected works fill 60 to 80 quarto volumes , more than anybody in the field . He spent most of his adult life in St. Petersburg , Russia , and in Berlin , then the capital of Prussia . 
 A statement attributed to Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace expresses Euler 's influence on mathematics : " Read Euler , read Euler , he is the master of us all . " 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Leonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707 , in Basel , Switzerland to Paul Euler , a pastor of the Reformed Church , and Marguerite née Brucker , a pastor 's daughter . He had two younger sisters : Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena , and a younger brother Johann Heinrich . Soon after the birth of Leonhard , the <unk> moved from Basel to the town of Riehen , where Euler spent most of his childhood . Paul Euler was a friend of the Bernoulli family ; Johann Bernoulli was then regarded as Europe 's foremost mathematician , and would eventually be the most important influence on young Leonhard . 
 Euler 's formal education started in Basel , where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother . In 1720 , aged thirteen , he enrolled at the University of Basel , and in 1723 , he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of Descartes and Newton . At that time , he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli , who quickly discovered his new pupil 's incredible talent for mathematics . At that time Euler 's main studies included theology , Greek , and Hebrew at his father 's urging in order to become a pastor , but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician . 
 In 1726 , Euler completed a dissertation on the propagation of sound with the title De Sono . At that time , he was unsuccessfully attempting to obtain a position at the University of Basel . In 1727 , he first entered the Paris Academy Prize Problem competition ; the problem that year was to find the best way to place the masts on a ship . Pierre Bouguer , who became known as " the father of naval architecture " , won and Euler took second place . Euler later won this annual prize twelve times . 
 = = = Saint Petersburg = = = 
 Around this time Johann Bernoulli 's two sons , Daniel and Nicolaus , were working at the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg . On 31 July 1726 , Nicolaus died of fever after spending less than a year in Russia , and when Daniel assumed his brother 's position in the mathematics / physics division , he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler . In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer , but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel . 
 Euler arrived in Saint Petersburg on 17 May 1727 . He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department . He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he often worked in close collaboration . Euler mastered Russian and settled into life in Saint Petersburg . He also took on an additional job as a medic in the Russian Navy . 
 The Academy at Saint Petersburg , established by Peter the Great , was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe . As a result , it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler . The academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility . Very few students were enrolled in the academy in order to lessen the faculty 's teaching burden , and the academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time and the freedom to pursue scientific questions . 
 The Academy 's benefactress , Catherine I , who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband , died on the day of Euler 's arrival . The Russian nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve @-@ year @-@ old Peter II . The nobility were suspicious of the academy 's foreign scientists , and thus cut funding and caused other difficulties for Euler and his colleagues . 
 Conditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II , and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made professor of physics in 1731 . Two years later , Daniel Bernoulli , who was fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg , left for Basel . Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department . 
 On 7 January 1734 , he married Katharina Gsell ( 1707 – 1773 ) , a daughter of Georg Gsell , a painter from the Academy Gymnasium . The young couple bought a house by the Neva River . Of their thirteen children , only five survived childhood . 
 = = = Berlin = = = 
 Concerned about the continuing turmoil in Russia , Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 to take up a post at the Berlin Academy , which he had been offered by Frederick the Great of Prussia . He lived for twenty @-@ five years in Berlin , where he wrote over 380 articles . In Berlin , he published the two works for which he would become most renowned : The Introductio in analysin infinitorum , a text on functions published in 1748 , and the Institutiones calculi <unk> , published in 1755 on differential calculus . In 1755 , he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . 
 In addition , Euler was asked to tutor Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg @-@ <unk> , the Princess of Anhalt @-@ Dessau and Frederick 's niece . Euler wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s , which were later compiled into a best @-@ selling volume entitled Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess . This work contained Euler 's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics , as well as offering valuable insights into Euler 's personality and religious beliefs . This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works , and was published across Europe and in the United States . The popularity of the ' Letters ' testifies to Euler 's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience , a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist . 
 Despite Euler 's immense contribution to the Academy 's prestige , he eventually incurred the ire of Frederick and ended up having to leave Berlin . The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill @-@ informed on matters beyond numbers and figures . Euler was a simple , devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs , in many ways the polar opposite of Voltaire , who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick 's court . Euler was not a skilled debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about , making him the frequent target of Voltaire 's wit . Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler 's practical engineering abilities : 
 I wanted to have a water jet in my garden : Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir , from where it should fall back through channels , finally spurting out in Sanssouci . My mill was carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir . Vanity of vanities ! Vanity of geometry ! 
 = = = Eyesight deterioration = = = 
 Euler 's eyesight worsened throughout his mathematical career . In 1738 , three years after nearly expiring from fever , he became almost blind in his right eye , but Euler rather blamed the painstaking work on cartography he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition . Euler 's vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany , to the extent that Frederick referred to him as " Cyclops " . Euler later developed a cataract in his left eye , which was discovered in 1766 . Just a few weeks after its discovery , he was rendered almost totally blind . However , his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity , as he compensated for it with his mental calculation skills and exceptional memory . For example , Euler could repeat the Aeneid of Virgil from beginning to end without hesitation , and for every page in the edition he could indicate which line was the first and which the last . With the aid of his scribes , Euler 's productivity on many areas of study actually increased . He produced on average , one mathematical paper every week in the year 1775 . 
 = = = Return to Russia and death = = = 
 In 1760 , with the Seven Years ' War raging , Euler 's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by advancing Russian troops . Upon learning of this event , General Ivan Petrovich <unk> paid compensation for the damage caused to Euler 's estate , later Empress Elizabeth of Russia added a further payment of 4000 roubles - an exorbitant amount at the time . The political situation in Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great 's accession to the throne , so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy . His conditions were quite exorbitant – a 3000 ruble annual salary , a pension for his wife , and the promise of high @-@ ranking appointments for his sons . All of these requests were granted . He spent the rest of his life in Russia . However , his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy . A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home , and almost his life . In 1773 , he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage . 
 Three years after his wife 's death , Euler married her half @-@ sister , Salome Abigail Gsell ( 1723 – 1794 ) . This marriage lasted until his death . In 1782 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . 
 In St. Petersburg on 18 September 1783 , after a lunch with his family , Euler was discussing the newly discovered planet Uranus and its orbit with a fellow academician Anders Johan Lexell , when he collapsed from a brain hemorrhage . He died a few hours later . Jacob von <unk> @-@ <unk> wrote a short obituary for the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian mathematician Nicolas Fuss , one of Euler 's disciples , wrote a more detailed eulogy which he delivered at a memorial meeting . In his eulogy for the French Academy , French mathematician and philosopher Marquis de Condorcet , wrote : 
 il <unk> de <unk> et de vivre — ... he ceased to calculate and to live . 
 Euler was buried next to Katharina at the Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery on <unk> Island . In 1785 , the Russian Academy of Sciences put a marble bust of Leonhard Euler on a pedestal next to the Director 's seat and , in 1837 , placed a headstone on Euler 's grave . To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Euler 's birth , the headstone was moved in 1956 , together with his remains , to the 18th @-@ century necropolis at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery . 
 = = Contributions to mathematics and physics = = 
 Euler worked in almost all areas of mathematics , such as geometry , infinitesimal calculus , trigonometry , algebra , and number theory , as well as continuum physics , lunar theory and other areas of physics . He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics ; if printed , his works , many of which are of fundamental interest , would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes . Euler 's name is associated with a large number of topics . 
 Euler is the only mathematician to have two numbers named after him : the important Euler 's number in calculus , e , approximately equal to 2 @.@ 71828 , and the Euler – Mascheroni constant γ ( gamma ) sometimes referred to as just " Euler 's constant " , approximately equal to 0 @.@ <unk> . It is not known whether γ is rational or irrational . 
 = = = Mathematical notation = = = 
 Euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks . Most notably , he introduced the concept of a function and was the first to write f ( x ) to denote the function f applied to the argument x . He also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric functions , the letter e for the base of the natural logarithm ( now also known as Euler 's number ) , the Greek letter Σ for summations and the letter i to denote the imaginary unit . The use of the Greek letter π to denote the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler , although it did not originate with him . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 The development of infinitesimal calculus was at the forefront of 18th Century mathematical research , and the <unk> — family friends of Euler — were responsible for much of the early progress in the field . Thanks to their influence , studying calculus became the major focus of Euler 's work . While some of Euler 's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour ( in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra ) , his ideas led to many great advances . Euler is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series , the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms , such as 
 <formula> 
 Notably , Euler directly proved the power series expansions for e and the inverse tangent function . ( Indirect proof via the inverse power series technique was given by Newton and Leibniz between 1670 and 1680 . ) His daring use of power series enabled him to solve the famous Basel problem in 1735 ( he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741 ) : 
 <formula> 
 Euler introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms in analytic proofs . He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series , and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and complex numbers , thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms . He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers , and discovered its relation to the trigonometric functions . For any real number φ ( taken to be radians ) , Euler 's formula states that the complex exponential function satisfies 
 <formula> 
 A special case of the above formula is known as Euler 's identity , 
 <formula> 
 called " the most remarkable formula in mathematics " by Richard P. Feynman , for its single uses of the notions of addition , multiplication , exponentiation , and equality , and the single uses of the important constants 0 , 1 , e , i and π . In 1988 , readers of the Mathematical Intelligencer voted it " the Most Beautiful Mathematical Formula Ever " . In total , Euler was responsible for three of the top five formulae in that poll . 
 De Moivre 's formula is a direct consequence of Euler 's formula . 
 In addition , Euler elaborated the theory of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations . He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits , foreshadowing the development of modern complex analysis . He also invented the calculus of variations including its best @-@ known result , the Euler – Lagrange equation . 
 Euler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems . In doing so , he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study , analytic number theory . In breaking ground for this new field , Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series , q @-@ series , hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions . For example , he proved the <unk> of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series , and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed . Euler 's work in this area led to the development of the prime number theorem . 
 = = = Number theory = = = 
 Euler 's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of Christian Goldbach , his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy . A lot of Euler 's early work on number theory was based on the works of Pierre de Fermat . Euler developed some of Fermat 's ideas , and disproved some of his conjectures . 
 Euler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis . He proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges . In doing so , he discovered the connection between the Riemann zeta function and the prime numbers ; this is known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function . 
 Euler proved Newton 's identities , Fermat 's little theorem , Fermat 's theorem on sums of two squares , and he made distinct contributions to Lagrange 's four @-@ square theorem . He also invented the totient function φ ( n ) , the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer n that are coprime to n . Using properties of this function , he generalized Fermat 's little theorem to what is now known as Euler 's theorem . He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers , which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid . He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes earlier proved by Euclid was one @-@ to @-@ one , a result otherwise known as the Euclid – Euler theorem . Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity . The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory , and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss . By 1772 Euler had proved that 231 − 1 = 2 @,@ 147 @,@ 483 @,@ 647 is a Mersenne prime . It may have remained the largest known prime until 1867 . 
 = = = Graph theory = = = 
 In 1735 , Euler presented a solution to the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg . The city of Königsberg , Prussia was set on the Pregel River , and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges . The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point . It is not possible : there is no <unk> circuit . This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory , specifically of planar graph theory . 
 Euler also discovered the formula V − E + F = 2 relating the number of vertices , edges and faces of a convex polyhedron , and hence of a planar graph . The constant in this formula is now known as the Euler characteristic for the graph ( or other mathematical object ) , and is related to the genus of the object . The study and generalization of this formula , specifically by Cauchy and L 'Huillier , is at the origin of topology . 
 = = = Applied mathematics = = = 
 Some of Euler 's greatest successes were in solving real @-@ world problems analytically , and in describing numerous applications of the Bernoulli numbers , Fourier series , Venn diagrams , Euler numbers , the constants e and π , continued fractions and integrals . He integrated Leibniz 's differential calculus with Newton 's Method of Fluxions , and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems . He made great strides in improving the numerical approximation of integrals , inventing what are now known as the Euler approximations . The most notable of these approximations are Euler 's method and the Euler – Maclaurin formula . He also facilitated the use of differential equations , in particular introducing the Euler – Mascheroni constant : 
 <formula> 
 One of Euler 's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music . In 1739 he wrote the <unk> novae <unk> <unk> , hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics . This part of his work , however , did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians . 
 = = = Physics and astronomy = = = 
 Euler helped develop the Euler – Bernoulli beam equation , which became a cornerstone of engineering . Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in classical mechanics , Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems . His work in astronomy was recognized by a number of Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career . His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies , understanding the nature of comets , and calculating the parallax of the sun . His calculations also contributed to the development of accurate longitude tables . 
 In addition , Euler made important contributions in optics . He disagreed with Newton 's corpuscular theory of light in the Opticks , which was then the prevailing theory . His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought , at least until the development of the quantum theory of light . 
 In 1757 he published an important set of equations for <unk> flow , that are now known as the Euler equations . In differential form , the equations are : 
 <formula> 
 where 
 ρ is the fluid mass density , 
 u is the fluid velocity vector , with components u , v , and w , 
 E 
 = ρ e + ½ ρ ( u2 + v2 + w2 ) is the total energy per unit volume , with e being the internal energy per unit mass for the fluid , 
 p is the pressure , 
 ⊗ denotes the tensor product , and 
 0 being the zero vector . 
 Euler is also well known in structural engineering for his formula giving the critical buckling load of an ideal strut , which depends only on its length and flexural stiffness :

 where 
 F = 
 maximum or critical force ( vertical load on column ) , 
 E

 Euler is also credited with using closed curves to illustrate syllogistic reasoning ( 1768 ) . These diagrams have become known as Euler diagrams . 
 An Euler diagram is a diagrammatic means of representing sets and their relationships . Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves ( usually circles ) in the plane that depict sets . Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or " zones " : the interior , which symbolically represents the elements of the set , and the exterior , which represents all elements that are not members of the set . The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important : the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap . The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve ( overlap , containment or neither ) corresponds to set @-@ theoretic relationships ( intersection , subset and <unk> ) . Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets . Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements ; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets ( the intersection of the sets ) . A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a subset of it . Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement in the 1960s . Since then , they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Even when dealing with music , Euler ’ s approach is mainly mathematical . His writings on music are not particularly numerous ( a few hundred pages , in his total production of about thirty thousand pages ) , but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that did not leave him throughout his life . 
 A first point of Euler ’ s musical theory is the definition of " genres " , i.e. of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5 . Euler describes 18 such genres , with the general definition <unk> , where A is the " exponent " of the genre ( i.e. the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5 ) and 2m ( where " m is an indefinite number , small or large , so long as the sounds are perceptible " ) , expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned . The first genre , with A 
 = 1 , is the octave itself ( or its duplicates ) ; the second genre , <unk> , is the octave divided by the fifth ( fifth + fourth , C – G – C ) ; the third genre is <unk> , major third + minor sixth ( C – E – C ) ; the fourth is <unk> , two fourths and a tone ( C – F – Bb – C ) ; the fifth is <unk> ( C – E – G – B – C ) ; etc . Genres 12 ( <unk> ) , 13 ( <unk> ) and 14 ( <unk> ) are corrected versions of the diatonic , chromatic and enharmonic , respectively , of the Ancients . Genre 18 ( <unk> ) is the " <unk> @-@ chromatic " , " used generally in all compositions " , and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson . Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7 . 
 Euler devised a specific graph , the Speculum musicum , to illustrate the <unk> @-@ chromatic genre , and discussed paths in this graph for specific intervals , reminding his interest for the Seven Bridges of Königsberg ( see above ) . The device knew a renewed interest as the <unk> in neo @-@ Riemannian theory ( see also Lattice ( music ) ) . 
 Euler further used the principle of the " exponent " to propose a derivation of the gradus <unk> ( degree of suavity , of agreeableness ) of intervals and chords from their prime factors – one must keep in mind that he considered just intonation , i.e. 1 and the prime numbers 3 and 5 only . Formulas have been proposed extending this system to any number of prime numbers , e.g. in the form 
 ds = 
 Σ ( <unk> - ki ) + 1 
 where pi are prime numbers and ki their exponents . 
 = = Personal philosophy and religious beliefs = = 
 Euler and his friend Daniel Bernoulli were opponents of Leibniz 's <unk> and the philosophy of Christian Wolff . Euler insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws , something that <unk> and <unk> science were unable to provide . Euler 's religious leanings might also have had a bearing on his dislike of the doctrine ; he went so far as to label Wolff 's ideas as " heathen and atheistic " . 
 Much of what is known of Euler 's religious beliefs can be deduced from his Letters to a German Princess and an earlier work , <unk> der <unk> <unk> Gegen die <unk> der <unk> ( Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the <unk> ) . These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired ; the <unk> was primarily an argument for the divine inspiration of scripture . 
 There is a famous legend inspired by Euler 's arguments with secular philosophers over religion , which is set during Euler 's second stint at the St. Petersburg academy . The French philosopher Denis Diderot was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great 's invitation . However , the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher 's arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court , and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman . Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the existence of God : he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court . Euler appeared , advanced toward Diderot , and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this non @-@ sequitur : " Sir , a + bn / n = x , hence God exists — reply ! " Diderot , to whom ( says the story ) all mathematics was gibberish , stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court . Embarrassed , he asked to leave Russia , a request that was graciously granted by the Empress . However amusing the anecdote may be , it is apocryphal , given that Diderot himself did research in mathematics . The legend was apparently first told by Dieudonné Thiébault with significant embellishment by Augustus De Morgan .

 Euler was featured on the sixth series of the Swiss 10 @-@ franc banknote and on numerous Swiss , German , and Russian postage stamps . The asteroid 2002 Euler was named in his honor . He is also commemorated by the Lutheran Church on their Calendar of Saints on 24 May — he was a devout Christian ( and believer in biblical inerrancy ) who wrote apologetics and argued forcefully against the prominent atheists of his time .

 A definitive collection of Euler 's works , entitled Opera Omnia , has been published since 1911 by the Euler Commission of the Swiss Academy of Sciences . A complete chronological list of Euler 's works is available at the following page : The <unk> Index ( PDF ) . 
 = Hugh de Mapenor = 
 Hugh de Mapenor ( or Hugh de <unk> ; died April 1219 ) was a medieval Bishop of Hereford . Although educated and given the title of magister , or " master " , the details of his schooling are unknown . Mapenor was a clerk for Giles de Braose , his predecessor as bishop . Later , Mapenor served as Dean of Hereford before being elected as bishop against the wishes of King John of England . During his short episcopate , he supported John 's son and successor King Henry III of England , and was active in his diocese , as a number of surviving documents show . He also served as a diplomat for the king .
