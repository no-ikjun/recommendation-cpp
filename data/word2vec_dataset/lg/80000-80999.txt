 In October 1887 Davies became the surveyor to the <unk> Road Board . On 10 April 1893 , he joined the <unk> Mounted Rifle Volunteers , and was commissioned as a lieutenant in May 1895 ; he was quickly promoted to captain six weeks later , becoming the commander of the unit . He was also active in local government , and in February 1897 was elected a member of the New Plymouth Harbour Board , representing Taranaki North .

 On 3 October 1899 Davies transferred into the Permanent Force of the New Zealand Militia , where he was made responsible for the training of volunteer mounted units . The Boer War , however , was declared a week later ; Davies was quickly seconded to command a company of the volunteer First New Zealand Contingent being sent to the Cape . The contingent sailed on 21 October , arrived in late November , and was on active service within a week . Davies was promoted to Major in May 1900 , and in the same month was given temporary command of the Third New Zealand Contingent . He was transferred to the Rhodesian Field Force , where he commanded the Fourth New Zealand Contingent in August 1900 . 
 He established a high professional reputation commanding the unit , and was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) , as well as winning the respect of his men – one described him as " not only liked but loved " . A soldier wrote home calling Davies , who stood five feet six inches tall , " a grand little chap " , whilst another noted with pleasure that Davies objected to " Imperial ideas of discipline " being forced upon his men . 
 After being mentioned in despatches in May 1901 he returned home to command the Auckland Military District , but was ordered back to South Africa in command of the eighth New Zealand Contingent , in February 1902 , with the brevet rank of colonel . The contingent operated as a single unit , unlike its predecessors , and Davies became the first officer from New Zealand to command an independent force on active service overseas . 
 = = Military reform = = 
 Returning to New Zealand in late 1902 , Davies resumed command of the Auckland military district . He held command until 1906 , when he was appointed inspector @-@ general of the New Zealand Military Forces and became a member of the Council of Defence , the body responsible for controlling the dominion 's military forces . The position of inspector @-@ general , newly created that year , was originally expected to go to an " Imperial " – that is , British – officer , but the government had announced it planned to rotate New Zealand officers in the role , on up to five @-@ year terms , so as to allow them to gain experience . 
 Davies threw himself into the role , travelling around the country and inspecting local units to gain an overall idea of their efficiency . Even under favourable circumstances , however , he found that only 54 % of the volunteers attended parades in 1906 ; at the annual camps , the proportion was as low as 45 % . He pressed for greater use of active day @-@ time tactical training rather than evening indoors drill , which he felt was key for a part @-@ time volunteer force , and for a greater emphasis on the training and standards of officers . By the end of his second year in office , he had organised local selection boards for appointing officers , and a central promotion board for senior field officers , as well as mandatory regular fitness and efficiency tests . 
 As a member of the Council of Defence , he strongly supported the movement for universal military training – not conventional conscription , but rather a form of basic military training on a part @-@ time basis for all adult men – arguing that it would mean " the flower of the nation would be the soldiers , not the weeds " . 
 = = British service = = 
 After three years as Inspector @-@ General , and in order to gain staff experience , Davies was attached as an observer to a number of units in the United Kingdom in 1909 – 10 . During this time , he also attended the Imperial Defence Conference and represented the New Zealand forces at the funeral of King Edward VII . At the end of the one @-@ year attachment , he had so impressed the British Army that they offered him an appointment as commander of 6th Brigade in October 1910 , with the temporary rank of brigadier general . As such , he became the first overseas officer to command a regular brigade , only eleven years after taking up a permanent military commission . 
 Davies ' tenure in command of 6th Brigade was due to expire in October 1914 , when he was to hand over command to John Keir , and it was rumoured in New Zealand that he might be appointed as General Officer Commanding the Home Forces in 1915 , succeeding Alexander Godley . However , with the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 , his command was mobilised as part of 2nd Division in the British Expeditionary Force and sent to France . The brigade saw heavy combat at the Battle of Mons , where Davies was mentioned in despatches , but he was quickly worn down by his habit of always marching at the head of his brigade , which put him under heavy physical and mental strain , and from the lasting effects of an attack of pneumonia earlier in the year . One report described him as " much changed , full of nerves ... very jumpy " . He was relieved of command after the First Battle of the Aisne in September and ordered home , being replaced by Colonel Robert Fanshawe , formerly GSO 1 of 1st Division , on 20 September . 
 He was appointed a divisional commander , with the rank of temporary major general , on 19 October 1914 , and took command of the newly raised 20th ( Light ) Division at some point in September – October . This made him the first New Zealand officer to command a division in the war . On 18 February 1915 , he was formally transferred to the British Army , and promoted to major general . The 20th Division moved to France in July 1915 , and he commanded it during a minor operation in September , but handed over command on 8 March 1916 due to ill @-@ health . He was appointed to command a reserve centre at Cannock Chase , Staffordshire , where the arrival of elements of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade in September 1917 meant that he once again had the opportunity to command his own countrymen . He was relieved of command by General Robert Wanless O <unk> in March 1918 , and on 9 May 1918 , after a prolonged period of physical and mental ill health , he committed suicide at the Special Neurological Hospital for Officers , Kensington . 
 = Body Count ( album ) = 
 Body Count is the eponymous debut album of American heavy metal band Body Count . Released in 1992 , the album material focuses on various social and political issues ranging from police brutality to drug abuse . The album presents a turning point in the career of Ice @-@ T , who co @-@ wrote the album 's songs with lead guitarist Ernie C and performed as the band 's lead singer . Previously known only as a rapper , Ice @-@ T 's work with the band helped establish a crossover audience with rock music fans . The album produced one single , " There Goes the Neighborhood " . 
 Body Count is well known for the inclusion of the controversial song " Cop Killer " , which was the subject of much criticism from various political figures , although many defended the song on the basis of the group 's right to freedom of speech . Ice @-@ T eventually chose to remove the song from the album , although it continues to be performed live . It was voted the 31st best album of the year in The Village Voice 's Pazz & Jop critics poll , and is believed to have helped pave the way for the mainstream success of the rap metal genre , although the album itself does not feature rapping in any of its songs . 
 = = Conception = = 
 Ice @-@ T formed Body Count out of this interest . The band comprised musicians Ice @-@ T had known from Crenshaw High School . Ice @-@ T states that " I knew we didn 't want to form an R & B group . [ ... ] Where am I gonna get the rage and the anger to attack something with that ? [ ... ] We knew Body Count had to be a rock band . The name alone negates the band from being R & B. " 
 Ice @-@ T co @-@ wrote the band 's music and lyrics with lead guitarist Ernie C , and took on the duties of lead vocalist . Ice @-@ T states that " I knew I couldn 't sing , but then I thought , ' Who can sing in rock ' n ' roll ? ' " Aside from Ice @-@ T and Ernie C , the original line @-@ up consisted of Mooseman on bass , Beatmaster V on drums and D @-@ Roc on rhythm guitar . According to Ice @-@ T , " We named the group Body Count because every Sunday night in L.A. , I 'd watch the news , and the newscasters would tally up the youths killed in gang homicides that week and then just segue to sports . ' Is that all I am , ' I thought , ' a body count ? ' " 
 Ice @-@ T introduced the band at Lollapalooza in 1991 , devoting half of his set to his hip hop songs , and half to Body Count songs , increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle @-@ class teenagers . Many considered the Body Count performances to be the highlight of the tour . The group made its first album appearance on Ice @-@ T 's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster . The song " Body Count " was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a " black hardcore band , " stating that " as far as I 'm concerned , music is music . I don 't look at it as rock , R & B , or all that kind of stuff . I just look at it as music . [ ... ] I do what I like and I happen to like rock ' n ' roll , and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music . " 
 Recording sessions for the group 's self @-@ titled debut took place from September to December 1991 . The album was released on March 31 , 1992 , on compact disc , vinyl , and audio cassette . Ice @-@ T states that Body Count was intentionally different from his solo hip hop albums in that " An Ice T album has intelligence , and at times it has ignorance . Sometimes it has anger , sometimes it has questions . But Body Count was intended to reflect straight anger . It was supposed to be the voice of the angry brother , without answers . [ ... ] If you took a kid and you put him in jail with a microphone and asked him how he feels , you 'd get Body Count : ' Fuck that . Fuck school . Fuck the police . ' You wouldn 't get intelligence or compassion . You 'd get raw anger . " From the album , " There Goes The Neighborhood " was released as a single , while " Body Count 's in the House " was featured in the film Universal Soldier . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Ernie C and Ice @-@ T conceived the album with the dark , ominous tone and Satanic lyrical themes of Black Sabbath in mind . However , Ice @-@ T felt that basing his lyrics in reality would be scarier than the fantasy basis in Black Sabbath 's lyrics ; the inner artwork depicts a man with a gun pointed at the viewer 's face . Ice @-@ T states , " To us that was the devil [ ... ] what 's more scary than [ ... ] some gangster with a gun pointed at you ? " Ice @-@ T defined the resulting mix of heavy metal and reality @-@ based lyrics as " a rock album with a rap mentality . " The album 's musical style is primarily described as speed metal , thrash metal and heavy metal . Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that with Body Count , Ice @-@ T " has recognized a kinship between his gangster raps and post @-@ punk , hard @-@ core rock , both of which break taboos to titillate fans . But where rap 's core audience is presumably in the inner city , hard @-@ core appeals mostly to suburbanites seeking more gritty thrills than they can get from Nintendo or the local mall . " 
 Despite Ice @-@ T 's attempts to differentiate Body Count from his work in the hip hop genre , the press focused on the group 's rap image . Ice @-@ T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song " Cop Killer " as rap to provoke negative criticism . " There is absolutely no way to listen to the song ' Cop Killer ' and call it a rap record . It 's so far from rap . But , politically , they know by saying the word rap they can get a lot of people who think , ' Rap @-@ black @-@ rap @-@ black @-@ ghetto , ' and don 't like it . You say the word rock , people say , ' Oh , but I like Jefferson Airplane , I like Fleetwood Mac — that 's rock . ' They don 't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song . " Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit , although Ice @-@ T does not rap on any of the album 's tracks . Ernie C stated that " A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band , but it has to be done sincerely . You can 't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work . [ ... ] [ We ] really loved the music we were doing , and it showed . " 
 = = Lyrical themes = = 
 Like Ice @-@ T 's gangsta rap albums , Body Count 's material focused on various social and political issues , with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse . According to Ernie C , " Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up , and we were no exception . Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach , we sing about the way we grew up . " Ice @-@ T states that " Body Count was an angry record . It was meant to be a protest record . I put my anger in it , while lacing it with dark humor . " The spoken introduction , " Smoked Pork " features Ice @-@ T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid . The track begins with Mooseman and Ice @-@ T driving their car towards a police car , and then Ice @-@ T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car , much to Mooseman 's chagrin , as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round . Ice @-@ T then walks up to the policeman , pretending to be a stranded motorist , asking for help , but the policeman refuses , saying : " Nah , that 's not my job ! My job 's not to help your fuckin ' ass out ! " , then telling him that " my job is eatin ' these doughnuts " . When the officer recognizes Ice @-@ T , gunshots are heard . The final voice on the track is Ice @-@ T confirming his identity . 
 In the lyrics of " KKK Bitch , " Ice @-@ T describes a sexual encounter with a woman who he soon learns is the daughter of the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan . The lyrics go on to describe a scenario in which members of Body Count " crash " a Klan meeting to " get buck wild with the white freaks " . Ice @-@ T makes humorous reference to " [ falling ] in love with Tipper Gore 's two twelve year old nieces " , and ponders the possibility of the Grand Wizard coming after him " when his grandson 's named little Ice @-@ T. " In The Ice Opinion : Who Gives a Fuck ? , Ice @-@ T wrote that " ' KKK Bitch ' was ironic because the sentiments were true . We 'd play Ku Klux Klan areas in the South and the girls would always come backstage and tell us how their brothers and fathers didn 't like black folks . [ ... ] We knew that ' KKK Bitch ' would totally piss off the Ku Klux Klan . There 's humor in the song , but it fucks with them . It 's on a punk tip . " 
 " Voodoo " describes a fictional encounter between Ice @-@ T and an old woman with a voodoo doll . " The Winner Loses " describes the downfall of a crack cocaine user . " There Goes the Neighborhood " is a sarcastic response to critics of Body Count , sung from the point of view of a racist white rocker who wonders " Don 't they know rock 's just for whites ? / Don 't they know the rules ? / Those niggers are too hardcore / This shit ain 't cool . " For the song 's music video , the word " nigger " was replaced with the phrase " black boys " . The music video ends with a black musician implanting an electric guitar into the ground and setting it on fire . The final image is similar to that of a burning cross . 
 " Evil Dick " focuses on male promiscuity . Its lyrics describe a married man who is led to seek strange women after his " evil dick " tells him " Don 't sleep alone , don 't sleep alone . " " Momma 's Gotta Die Tonight " follows the account of a black teenager who murders and dismembers his racist mother after she reacts negatively when he brings a white girl home . In The Ice Opinion : Who Gives a Fuck ? , Ice @-@ T wrote that the song 's lyrics are metaphorical , explaining that " Whoever is still perpetuating racism has got to die , not necessarily physically , but they have to kill off that part of their brain . From now on , consider it dead . The entire attitude is dead . " 
 Ice @-@ T referred to the album 's final track , " Cop Killer " as a protest song , stating that the song is " [ sung ] in the first person as a character who is fed up with police brutality . " The song was written in 1990 , and had been performed live several times , including at Lollapalooza , before it had been recorded in a studio . The album version mentions then @-@ Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and the black motorist Rodney King , whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape . In The Ice Opinion : Who Gives a Fuck ? , Ice @-@ T wrote that the song " [ is ] a warning , not a threat — to authority that says , ' Yo , police : We 're human beings . Treat us accordingly . ' " In an interview for Rolling Stone , Ice @-@ T stated that " We just celebrated the fourth of July , which is really just national Fuck the Police Day [ ... ] I bet that during the Revolutionary War , there were songs similar to mine . "

 Initial copies of the album were shipped out in black body bags , a promotional device that drew minor criticism . The album debuted at No. 32 on Billboard 's Top 50 albums , peaking at No. 26 on the Billboard 200 . By January 29 , 1993 , the album sold 480 @,@ 000 copies , according to Variety . However , according to the Recording Industry Association of America , Body Count was certified gold for sale shipments in excess of 500 @,@ 000 copies , with a certification date back to August 4 , 1992 . 
 In a positive review for The Village Voice , music critic Robert Christgau said Ice @-@ T " takes rap 's art @-@ ain 't @-@ life defense over the top " on a heavy metal album which utilizes and parodies " the style 's <unk> privilege " . He wrote that the music is " flat @-@ out hard rock , short on <unk> intricacy and fancy structures " , but that it is set apart from other metal by Ice @-@ T , who " describes racism in language metalheads can understand , kills several policemen , and cuts his mama into little pieces because she tells him to hate white people . This can be a very funny record . " Greg Kot , writing in the Chicago Tribune , felt the lyrics on some songs are pathologically flawed and off @-@ putting , but the band 's take on metal styles is impressive and , " on the stereotype @-@ bashing ' There Goes the Neighborhood , ' the humor , message and music coalesce brilliantly " . Don Kaye of Kerrang ! called Body Count a " noisy , relentless musical attack " . 
 In a less enthusiastic review for Rolling Stone , J. D. Considine wrote that " messages " are less important here than " the sort of sonic intensity parental groups fear even more than four @-@ letter words , " while AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album " a surprisingly tepid affair " partly because " all of Ice @-@ T 's half @-@ sung / half @-@ shouted lyrics fall far short of the standard he established on his hip @-@ hop albums . " In the Pazz & Jop , an annual poll of prominent critics published by The Village Voice , Body Count was voted the 31st best album of 1992 . Christgau , the poll 's supervisor , ranked it 22nd on his own year @-@ end list . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 The album was originally set to be distributed under the title Cop Killer , named for the song of the same name , which criticizes violent police officers . During the production of the album , Warner Bros. executives were aware of the potential controversy that the album and song could cause , but supported it . At a Time @-@ Warner shareholders ' meeting , actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song " KKK Bitch " to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action . Sire responded by changing the title to Body Count , but did not remove the song . In an article for the Washington Post , Tipper Gore condemned Ice @-@ T for songs like " Cop Killer , " writing that " Cultural economics were a poor excuse for the South 's continuation of slavery . Ice @-@ T 's financial success cannot excuse the <unk> of his message [ ... ] Hitler 's anti @-@ Semitism sold in Nazi Germany . That didn 't make it right . " The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album . <unk> called for a boycott of all products by Time @-@ Warner in order to secure the removal of the song and album from stores . Within a week , they were joined by police organizations across the United States . Ice @-@ T asserted that the song was written from the point of view of a fictional character , and told reporters that " I ain 't never killed no cop . I felt like it a lot of times . But I never did it . If you believe that I 'm a cop killer , you believe David Bowie is an astronaut , " in reference to Bowie 's song " Space Oddity " . 
 The National Black Police Association opposed the boycott of Time @-@ Warner and the attacks on " Cop Killer , " identifying police brutality as the cause of much anti @-@ police sentiment , and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards " to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers " as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count " to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music . [ ... ] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions , but want to scrutinize the actions of others . " Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence . Others defended the album on the basis of the group 's right to freedom of speech , and cited the fact that Ice @-@ T had portrayed a police officer in the film New Jack City . Ice @-@ T is quoted as saying that " I didn 't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment . I needed people to come in and say ' Ice @-@ T has grounds to make this record . ' I have the right to make it because the cops are killing my people . So fuck the First Amendment , let 's deal with the fact that I have the right to make it . " 
 Over the next month , controversy against the band grew . Vice President Dan Quayle branded " Cop Killer " as being " obscene , " and President George H.W. Bush publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product . Body Count was removed from the shelves of a retail store in Greensboro , North Carolina after local police had told the management that they would no longer respond to any emergency calls at the store if they continued to sell the album . In July 1992 , the New Zealand Police Commissioner unsuccessfully attempted to prevent an Ice @-@ T concert in Auckland , arguing that " Anyone who comes to this country preaching in obscene terms the killing of police , should not be welcome here , " before taking Body Count and Warner Bros. Records to the Indecent Publications Tribunal , in an effort to get it banned under New Zealand 's Indecent Publications Act . This was the first time in 20 years that a sound recording had come before the censorship body , and the first ever case involving popular music . After reviewing the various submissions , and listening carefully to the album , the Tribunal found the song " Cop Killer " to be " not <unk> , " saw the album as displaying " an honest purpose , " and found Body Count not indecent . The controversy escalated to the point where death threats were sent to Time @-@ Warner executives , and stockholders threatened to pull out of the company . Finally , Ice @-@ T decided to remove " Cop Killer " from the album of his own volition , a decision which was met by criticism from other artists who derided Ice @-@ T for " caving in to external pressure . " In an interview , Ice @-@ T stated that " I didn 't want my band to get pigeon @-@ holed as that 's the only reason that record sold . It just got outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it . I said , ' fuck it , ' I mean they 're saying we did it for money , and we didn 't . I 'd gave the record away , ya know , let 's move on , let 's get back to real issues , not a record but the cops that are out there killing people . " 
 " Cop Killer " was replaced by a new version of " Freedom of Speech , " a song from Ice @-@ T 's 1989 solo album The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech ... Just Watch What You Say . The song was re @-@ edited and remixed to give it a more rock @-@ oriented sound , using a looped sample from the Jimi Hendrix song " Foxy Lady . " Alongside the album 's reissue , Warner Bros. issued " Cop Killer " as a single . Ice @-@ T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album Home Invasion , taking Body Count with him . The studio version of " Cop Killer " has not been re @-@ released , although a live version of the song appears on Body Count 's 2005 release Live in L.A. According to Ernie C , the controversy over the song " still lingers for us , even now . I 'll try to book clubs and the guy I 'm talking to will mention it and I 'll think to myself ' Man , that was 17 years ago . ' But I meet a lot of bands who ask me about it too and I 'm real respected by other artists for it . But it 's a love / hate thing . Ice gets it too , even though he plays a cop on TV now on Law & Order SVU . " 
 In Australia , the track listings on copies of the new version of the album sold there ended at track 16 , omitting " Freedom of Speech " ( or " Cop Killer " and its spoken word intro , " Out in the Parking Lot " ) . This was likely because the track " Freedom of Speech " refers to the speech protections of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , which Australia does not have an equivalent to in its own Constitution , thus the track is not as relevant to Australian audiences .

 The show centers on Michael Britten ( Jason Isaacs ) a police detective living in two separate realities after a car accident . In the episode , Michael Britten finds out the truth about the car accident that caused his split realities , and seeks out those responsible for it . He finds out that Captain Tricia Harper ( Laura Innes ) caused the accident , alongside Ed Hawkins ( Kevin Weisman ) and Captain Carl Kessel ( Mark Harelik ) . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In his " green reality " ( where his son is alive and his wife is dead ) , Detective Michael Britten ( Jason Isaacs ) sits in a prison cell temporary for killing Detective Ed Hawkins ( Kevin Weisman ) , who caused Michael 's car accident . Meanwhile , his partner in the " green reality " , Detective Isaiah " Bird " Freeman ( Steve Harris ) finds heroin that Hawkins , under orders from Captain Kessel ( Mark Harelik ) , had placed in a self storage unit . Meanwhile , Captain Tricia Harper ( Laura Innes ) shoots Carl Kessel in a hotel room , making it look like a suicide to cover up her involvement in Michael 's accident . Michael is freed from the cell and Kessel 's body is found . 
 Michael regains consciousness ( after having passed out from a gunshot wound when Ed Hawkins was chasing after him ) near a dumpster in the " red reality " ( where his wife is alive and son is dead ) . The still @-@ alive Detective Hawkins takes Michael to his car , but Michael flees after attacking Hawkins and causes a car accident . Michael finds his therapist in the " red reality " , Dr. John Lee ( BD Wong ) , forces him to sew up the bullet wound , and takes him to the self @-@ storage unit to show him the heroin stash . Seeing no heroin , Michael then locks Lee in the containment center and contacts his partner in the " red reality " , detective Efrem Vega ( Wilmer Valderrama ) . Vega secretly takes Britten to his house but , upon returning to the police station , is convinced that Michael is unstable and allows Michael to be captured . Michael is first taken to the hospital to receive medical treatment and then goes to jail . 
 Harper visits Michael in jail . When Michael notices the caller ID of an incoming call matching Kessel 's hotel room pseudonym , he realizes Harper is part of the conspiracy and attempts to strangle her . Later , Michael is visited by himself from the " green reality " who leads him to the jail door . Past the door , Michael first witnesses Kessel 's murder and Detective Vega , in a penguin suit , shows Harper 's heel breaking in the process hinting that this can be used as hard evidence to place Harper at Kessel 's murder . Next Michael briefly meets his wife , Hannah ( Laura Allen ) in a restaurant before he finds his " green reality " self sleeping in his bedroom . He – his " red reality " self – lays down in bed as well and merges with his " green reality " self before waking up in said " green reality " . 
 In Harper 's office , Michael confronts her about her involvement in his accident , pulling out his gun to shoot her . However , he instead lets Bird and another detective arrest her . Later , Dr. Evans applauds Michael 's apparent rejection of the " red reality " and , when Michael suggests his fantastic experiences may have simply been a dream of the " red reality , " Dr. Evans warns him not to create a third reality . She suddenly goes still . Michael , confused , goes through her office door and finds himself in his bedroom . He goes downstairs and finds both his son , Rex ( Dylan Minnette ) , and wife alive . Concerned about Michael 's odd behavior , Hannah asks if he is okay . He replies , " I 'm perfect , " and closes his eyes .

This is his third appearance on the series , with the first being " Say Hello to My Little Friend " , the eleven episode . Other guest stars included Laura Innes as Tricia Harper and Mark Harelik as Carl Kessel . The episode is rated TV @-@ 14 on television in the United States . 
 The episode featured the song " Montana " by Youth Lagoon during the final scene . Many viewers wondered if the series creator had changed the ending for the last episode , due to the cancellation of the series . This caused series creator and executive producer Killen to assure viewers that the episode would have been " exactly the same " if it had been renewed for a second season . In a pre @-@ broadcast interview by Entertainment Weekly with Killen and actor Jason Isaacs , Isaacs claimed that he found it " strangely ironic and amusing " to be promoting the series finale of the Awake series . Killen claimed that " When we wrote the episode , we didn 't know it would be the end of the series " . He stated that it had a " satisfying conclusion " , " and I think it will be a satisfying way to leave the show " .

He also noted that parts of the episode were " surprising " , and that " the show embraced some final insanity before the end , it ’ s more the illusion of depth than actual depth " . Handlen wrote that " it ’ s hard to ask for more from an hour of television " , despite noting that he was " glad the series got cancelled " . Handlen noted that he would " look forward to their next projects " . Handlen concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of " B " . Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a positive review and claimed that there were some " gut @-@ wrenching " scenes in the episode . Fowler also opined that the episode was " thrilling " , " frustrating " , " fascinating " , and " terrible " to see Hannah " crying over an arrested Britten " . Fowler wrote that he " love [ d ] the open ending " . Noting that Awake was " one of the good ones " , Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode a " 9 @.@ 5 out of 10 " classifying it as " amazing " . Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic gave the episode a positive review . He opined that Michael " has a unique ability to dream in a way that feels real , why not recreate what was once lost " . McHatton found it " fitting that the show ended with Michael closing his eyes . Despite the fact that he did not know what the phrase " turtles all the way down " meant , he concluded his review by giving the episode a score " 5 @.@ 0 out of 5 @.@ 0 " . 
 Ross Bonaime of Paste magazine gave the episode a complimentary review . He started by claiming that Awake was " the best drama to come out the 2011 – 12 season on television , and one of the finest NBC dramas in years " . He also wondered " what Awake would be like in a Michael Britten @-@ like alternate reality where the show lasted five seasons , or 10 , or even just one more year " , Could Awake maintain this story for long and still be compelling ? " Bonaime wrote that it was " better to have one great season and be remembered fondly " . Bonaime claimed that the " ending is quite smart , given that it never truly clarifies if Michael was dreaming the whole time , or if Dr. Lee was right and that he was on the verge of completely snapping , which makes much more sense " . He was also grateful that " Awake decided to just go completely nuts with the last half of this episode " . He claimed that the episode and series was " different , a rare move , especially on network television " . He claimed that " Once Awake arrives on Netflix and DVD , people will rush through in a matter of days and will say they enjoyed their experience with this short yet sweet treasure " . He claimed that works with Awake should be " rewarded " and " praised " . Bonaime concluded his review by giving the episode a " 9 @.@ 0 out of 10 " . 
 Screen Rant 's Kevin Yeoman , gave much praise in the episode . Like Paste magazine and other critics reviews , Yeoman claimed that " there was certainly disappointment in finding out that Awake wouldn 't see a second season , and would instead be looked at as a 13 @-@ episode miniseries " . He claimed that the episode has the puzzling and high points that are similar to " That 's Not My Penguin " and " Say Hello to My Little Friend " . Again , Screen Crush 's Kevin Fitzpatrick was also disappointed that there would not be a second season . Verne Gay of Newsday gave the episode a complimenting review . He called it " promising " . He noted that he could see " why Awake was canceled " . He blessed " the show for at least trying " . He called it " challenging " and " original " . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode " fascinating " , " puzzling " and " moving " . Carl Cortez of Assignment X , again , enjoyed the episode . In his " B + " grade review , he noted that " you can view it as another missed opportunity " . He claimed that parts of the episode were " confusing " . He stated that he would " prefer to have more questions than answers " . He argued that the episode felt more like a " Series Finale , than Season Finale " , which he called " a good thing " , " Too many good shows go off into the sunset without a single resolution and this one at least strives for something more " . He also argued that NBC should have " put a little more promotional push " . He called it " challenging " and " interesting " . 
 = Report about Case Srebrenica = 
 Report about Case Srebrenica ( the first part ) was a controversial official report on the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina . It was prepared by Darko Trifunović and published by the Republika Srpska Government Bureau for Relations with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) . 
 The report denied that there had been a massacre at Srebrenica and accused the International Committee of the Red Cross of having " fabricated " its findings on the killings . Its claims were strongly criticised by the international community and the Bosniaks and were eventually disowned by the Republika Srpska government . In a judgment against Miroslav <unk> , the Hague Tribunal judges described the report as " one of the worst examples of revisionism . " No " second part " has ever been published . 
 = = Background = = 
 In July 1995 , forces of the Army of the Republika Srpska ( VRS ) captured the town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia , which had been cut off and surrounded despite the presence of soldiers from the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) . Thousands of refugees had crowded into the town to escape the Serb advance . Following the Serb takeover of Srebrenica , an estimated 8 @,@ 000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically massacred by Serb forces between 11 – 15 July and another 25 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 were subjected to ethnic cleansing . It was the largest act of mass murder in Europe since World War II . 
 Successive governments of Republika Srpska ( and , for a while , Serbia ) sought to deny the massacre and other war crimes committed by the VRS during the war . It was against this background that , as the former United Nations trial attorney Mark B. Harmon commented , " the campaign of misinformation and deceit reached its apotheosis seven years after the crimes were committed with the publication of the Report About Case Srebrenica ( the first part ) . " 
 = = Contents of the report = = 
 The report was promoted as an effort " to present the whole truth about crimes committed in Srebrenica region regardless nationality of perpetrators of crimes and time when they were committed [ sic ] . " It asserted that no more than 2 @,@ 000 Bosniaks ( Bosnian Muslims ) had died at Srebrenica – all armed soldiers , not civilians – and that 1 @,@ 600 of them had died in combat or while trying to escape the enclave . It consistently referred to the " alleged massacre " , attributed the deaths of about 100 Bosniaks to " exhaustion " and concluded : " the number of Muslim soldiers who were executed by Bosnian Serb forces for personal revenge or for simple ignorance of international law [ … ] would probably stand less than 100 . " The report dismissed as " mentally disturbed " a Bosnian Serb soldier who had admitted participating in the killings , and claimed that the survivors ' stories were a product of their imaginations : " To walk for almost 20 days in an area that might be full of landmines , without any food and water , under the fear of being shot from any direction was such a trauma that soldiers sometimes mixed reality with illusions . Having looked at dead bodies under such psychological [ pressure ] , some Muslim soldiers could have believed what they imagined . " It asserted that " this combat might have looked like a mass killing in the eyes of frightened Muslim soldiers , although they carried weapons and shot at Bosnian Serb soldiers randomly . " 
 The report also asserted that the findings of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations had been " manipulated " and " fabricated " . It characterised Serbs as the victims of Bosniak war crimes around Srebrenica , asserting that in 1992 and 1993 alone 1300 Serb civilians were killed . This figure has been shown to be inaccurate , and the true number " three to nine times smaller " , by the Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo , a non @-@ partisan institution with a multi @-@ ethnic staff , whose data have been collected , processed , checked , compared and evaluated by an international team of experts . The instigator of the massacre , General Ratko Mladić , was mentioned only in the context of demanding the surrender of the town and evacuating civilians ; the report asserted that he had tried " discouraging Serbs to take their wild revenge . " The report claimed that " the Muslims inflated the number [ of deaths ] in order to accomplish what they wanted from the very beginning – to involve the international community in the conflict with Serbs . " 
 According to Dejan Miletić , whom Paddy Ashdown , the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina , removed in April 2004 from his post as Head of the Republika Srpska Secretariat for Relations with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague and Research of War Crimes , the report " had based its conclusions on publications found on the Internet , reports from the United Nations and other sources . " It was intended to be sent to lawyers defending Bosnian Serbs on trial for war crimes . 
 = = ICTY verdict = = 
 The ICTY reviewed the " Report About Case Srebrenica " and concluded the following : 
 The Trial Chamber admitted into evidence a document which represents one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to the mass executions of Bosnian Muslims committed in Srebrenica in July 1995 . This document , titled “ Report about Case Srebrenica ( the First Part ) ” was prepared by the Documentation Centre of Republika Srpska , Bureau of Government of Republika Srpska for Relation with ICTY on 1 September 2002 . Throughout this report reference is made to the “ alleged massacre ” and this misrepresentation of the historical events culminates in the final conclusion of this report , which reads : [ … ] the number of Muslim soldiers who were executed by Bosnian Serb forces for personal revenge or for simple ignorance of international law [ … ] would probably stand less than 100 . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 After the report was published on 3 September 2002 , it was condemned by a wide variety of Bosnian and international figures . A spokesman for the ICTY told Radio Free Europe that " any claim that the number of victims after the fall of the Srebrenica enclave was around the 2 @,@ 000 mark , and most of those killed in battle , is an absolutely outrageous claim . It 's utterly false , and it flies in the face of all of the evidence painstakingly collected in the investigation into the tragedy . " He described the effort to minimise the number of victims as " frankly , disgusting . " Carla del Ponte , the chief prosecutor of the ICTY , described the report 's authors as " totally blind , profoundly insensitive and clearly willing to obstruct all efforts to find reconciliation , truth and justice . " Del Ponte 's legal adviser , Jean @-@ Jacques Joris , criticised the report as " a saddening example of revisionism and an element which certainly stands in the way of reconciliation in the region . " The ICTY prosecutors subsequently used the report as evidence in the trial in 2004 of Miroslav <unk> ; in their verdict , the judges called it " one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to [ the massacre ] " . 
 Paddy Ashdown , the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina , condemned it as " tendentious , preposterous and inflammatory " and " so far from the truth as to be almost not worth dignifying with a response . " His office issued a statement calling the report " an irresponsible attempt to deceive voters and to abuse the trauma of massacre survivors " . Ashdown 's spokesman , Julian Braithwaite , noted the report 's publication just before elections in the Republika Srpska : " The question for the RS government is why are they publishing this report now , at the time when it could be easily interpreted as irresponsible electioneering . If they are playing down the fact that civilians were massacred and that children are being exhumed from mass graves with their hands tied behind their backs , then that it is outrageous . " The European Union issued a statement calling on " all responsible people and institutions " to reject the study . The International Commission on Missing Persons issued a strongly worded statement calling the report a gross distortion of the facts : 
 Manipulation of the issue of the missing for political purposes , including the manipulation of numbers of missing , has been an ongoing practice within Bosnia and Herzegovina that only serves to cause further pain and suffering in a society that has already suffered so much . The study regarding the numbers of missing from the 1995 fall of Srebrenica made by the Republika Srpska 's Government Bureau for Relations with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) contains what <unk> believes to be serious inaccuracies . 
 The British Foreign Office minister Denis <unk> condemned the report as " an insult to the memory of those who died . The authors of this report belong in the same category as those who deny the Holocaust took place . " The United States embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina urged the Republika Srpska government to withdraw the report , calling it " an attempt to manipulate and divide the public in this country . " 
 Bosnian media , political parties and Srebrenica survivors were likewise strongly critical . The Sarajevo @-@ based newspaper Dnevni <unk> described the report as an attempt by the Bosnian Serb government to deny that genocide had taken place . The Srebrenica and <unk> Mothers Association condemned the report as " false , shameful and utterly amoral . " The Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina denounced it as " yet another attempt by the Serb Republic authorities in an unscrupulous and brutal way to negate what probably is the worst crime in Europe after WW2 . " Alija <unk> , the Prime Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina , called it " a surprising forgery which is trying to delude the public and especially the Serbs in BiH . I honestly believe that this is the last attempt to enliven the policy which marked the tragic past of BiH . <unk> the genocide cannot be a part of the election campaign . " 
 On the Bosnian Serb side , opinions of the report were initially favourable . The Bosnian Serb media largely supported the report , and Republika Srpska president Mirko <unk> ( who in October 2002 became the Serb member of the collective presidency ) said that the report " should not be dismissed out of hand but merits careful study " . A number of Bosnian Serb political figures made public statements denying that war crimes had happened and a government spokesman called the report a bid to promote " truth and reconciliation " . The Republika Srpska Socialist Party leader , Lazar <unk> , welcomed the report and accused the Bosniak side of having " hitherto presented only false reports , in which names were listed of persons who are still alive today . " 
 Nikola <unk> , the speaker of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska , called it " the worst election campaigning I have ever seen . " Milorad <unk> , who was later to become prime minister of Republika Srpska , castigated the report as having been " written by an amateur for the purpose of manipulating public opinion " in advance of the elections and said : 
 It is a political gaffe of the government , since one can see that the report was written several years ago by one man . The report had been written in 1996 and 1997 , which goes to show that it does not mention the report by the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation . [ ... ] The government shouldn 't have allowed itself to draft such a superficial , amateurish report which put Republika Srpska into such a difficult situation . Responsibility for the consequences of the report 's publication must be borne by those who produced it in such a superficial and amateurish way . 
 The Republika Srpska government was , however , more equivocal . Its prime minister , Mladen Ivanić , accused the media in the Federation entity of having " made [ a ] fuss over the report for their own purposes . " Nonetheless , the outcry from the international community forced the government of Republika Srpska to distance itself from the report , saying that it had not been fully analysed and endorsed : 
 The two studies , which the RS Government 's Bureau for Cooperation with the ICTY compiled , are not made by the RS Government . They are part of the report that the RS Government ’ s Bureau for Cooperation with the ICTY submits to the RS Government every three months . The fact that the Srebrenica report had been condemned by the Office of the High Representative before the Bureau 's news conference was held comes as a surprise . The Bureau representatives clearly said at the news conference that the both reports are to be submitted to the RS Government , which tells us that the OHR based its condemnation on news reports from the BiH Federation media , which said that the Bureau reports are RS Government 's report . It also comes as a surprise the fact that the OHR representatives commented on a document , which they have not read . This is another confirmation that the OHR gives in to the pressures coming from the Sarajevo media and that the OHR creates its views by using their [ the Sarajevo media 's ] information and press releases , thus bringing its own [ the OHR 's ] impartiality in question . 
 The Republika Srpska government subsequently disowned the report with Prime Minister Ivanić saying that it was an " unfinished version " and " not an attitude of the government of Republika Srpska . " Two years later , after further pressure from the international community , the Bosnian Serb government issued an official apology for the massacre and admitted that " enormous crimes " had been " committed in the area of Srebrenica in July 1995 .

 = Ach Gott , wie manches Herzeleid , BWV 3 = 
 Ach Gott , wie manches Herzeleid ( Oh God , how much heartache ) , BWV 3 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for the Second Sunday after Epiphany and first performed it on 14 January 1725 . It is based on the hymn published by Martin Moller in 1587 . 
 Bach composed the cantata in his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig as part of cantata cycle of chorale cantatas , for the second Sunday after Epiphany . The work is based on a hymn without evident connection to the prescribed readings . It is a meditation on Jesus as a comforter in distress , based on a medieval model . An unknown librettist reworked the ideas of the 18 stanzas in six movements , retaining the words of stanzas 1 , 2 and 18 as movements 1 , 2 and 6 . Similarly , Bach retained the choral melody in three movements , set as a chorale fantasia in the opening chorus with the bass singing the cantus firmus , as a four @-@ part setting with interspersed recitatives in the second movement , and in the closing chorale . He scored the cantata for two oboes d 'amore , strings and continuo , with an added <unk> to support the bass in the first movement , and a horn to support the soprano in the last movement . 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach composed the cantata in his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig as part of his second annual cycle , planned to consist only of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns . He wrote the cantata for the second Sunday after Epiphany . The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the Epistle to the Romans ( we have several gifts – Romans 12 : 6 – 16 ) and from the Gospel of John ( the Marriage at Cana – John 2 : 1 – 11 ) . 
 The cantata is a chorale cantata based on the hymn " Ach Gott , wie manches Herzeleid " in 18 stanzas attributed to Martin Moller ( 1587 ) . It is a paraphrase of the Latin " Jesu dulcis memoria " , a medieval hymn attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux , a meditation on Jesus as a comforter and helper in distress . The unknown librettist retained the words of stanzas 1 , 2 and 18 as movements 1 , 2 and 6 . In movement 2 , stanza 2 is expanded by paraphrases of stanzas 3 – 5 , while movement 3 is a paraphrase of stanza 6 ; movement 4 incorporates ideas from stanzas 7 – 14 , and movement 5 relies on stanzas 15 and <unk> movement 2 , stanza 2 is expanded by paraphrases of stanzas 3 – 5 . Movement 3 is a paraphrase of stanza 6 . Movement 4 incorporates ideas from stanzas 7 – 14 . Movement 5 relies on stanzas 15 and 16 . The poet did not relate his text to the reading from John 1 : 2 . 
 Bach led the first performance of the cantata on 14 January 1725 . 
 = = Scoring and structure = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in six movements . An opening chorus and a closing chorale frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias . The first recitative is unusual : the chorus sings one line of the hymn 's four lines , continued each time by a soloist in words of the poet . The last aria is a duet . Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists ( soprano ( S ) , alto ( A ) , tenor ( T ) , bass ( B ) ) , a four @-@ part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of horn ( Co ) to double the cantus firmus in the closing chorale , trombone ( Tb ) to reinforce the bass in the opening chorus , two oboes d 'amore ( Oa ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , and basso continuo . The autograph score bears the title : " Dominica 2 post <unk> / Ach Gott ! Wie manches <unk> . / à / 4 Voci . / 2 Hautb : d 'Amour / 2 Violini / Viola . / e Continuo / di J. S. Bach " , which means " Sunday 2 after Epiphany ... for four voices , 2 oboes d 'amore , 2 violins , viola and continuo by J. S. Bach " . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The continuo , played throughout , is not shown . 
 = = Music = = 
 Bach uses a melody of " Herr Jesu Christ , meins Lebens Licht " which appeared first in the Lochamer @-@ Liederbuch . The melody appears in the opening chorus , sung by the bass as a cantus firmus , in the second movement , as a four @-@ part setting with interspersed recitatives , and in the closing chorale . 
 = = = 1 = = = 
 In the opening chorus , " Ach Gott , wie manches Herzeleid " ( Ah , God , how much heartache ) , the cantus firmus is in the bass , which is doubled by the trombone , as in Ach Herr , mich <unk> <unk> , BWV 135 . Its mood of lamentation is supported by " elegiac sounds " of the oboes d 'amore , sighing motifs in the strings , and the upper voices reflecting the oboe motifs . John Eliot Gardiner , who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 , notes that Bach used a repeated motif of six notes in chromatic descent , which is often used in <unk> of the Baroque opera to express grief . The motif is used for the instrumental opening , each entry of a voice , interludes and conclusion . 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 The recitative , " Wie <unk> <unk> sich Fleisch und Blut " ( How difficult it is for flesh and blood ) , combines the hymn tune sung by the four @-@ part choir , with interpolated text sung by the soloists in turn . The lines of the hymn are separated by a joyful ostinato motif derived from the chorale tune . The musicologist Julian Mincham writes that the " hybrid recitative provides an excellent example of Bach 's experiments of investing long texts with sustained musical interest " . 
 = = = 3 = = = 
 The bass aria , " <unk> ich <unk> und Pein " ( Although I experience the fear and torment of Hell ) , is accompanied by the continuo .

 A tenor recitative , " Es mag mir Leib und Geist <unk> " ( My body and spirit might despair ) , expresses trust in Jesus to overcome despair .

 In the duet for soprano and alto , " Wenn Sorgen auf mich dringen " ( When cares press upon me ) , in " bright E major " , as the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff writes , the voices are embedded in a " dense quartet texture " . He concludes that the movement " banishes human care by means of joyful singing " . The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that the obbligato motif , which is later picked up by the voices , is played by the oboes d 'amore and violin in unison , providing " a new and remarkable tone colour " . Bach refers to the Cross , as mentioned in the text , by using a cross @-@ motif in the melody and applying double sharp marked by a cross . The voices intensify words such as " dringen " ( press ) and " <unk> " ( sing ) by extended coloraturas .

 = Hastings Line = 
 The Hastings Line is a secondary railway line in Kent and East Sussex , England , linking Hastings with the main town of Tunbridge Wells , and from there into London via Tonbridge and Sevenoaks . Although primarily carrying passengers , the railway serves a gypsum mine which is a source of freight traffic . Southeastern operates passenger trains on the line . 
 The railway was constructed by the South Eastern Railway in the early 1850s across the difficult terrain of the High Weald . Supervision of the building of the line was lax , enabling contractors to skimp on the lining of the tunnels . These deficiencies showed up after the railway had opened . <unk> led to a restricted loading gauge along the line , requiring the use of dedicated rolling stock . 
 Served by steam locomotives from opening until the late 1950s , passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of diesel @-@ electric multiple units built to the line 's loading gauge . Diesel locomotives handled freight , also built to fit the loading gauge . The diesel @-@ electric multiple units served on the line until 1986 , when the line was electrified and the most severely affected tunnels were reduced from double track to single . 
 = = Background = = 
 The South Eastern Railway ( SER ) completed its main line from London to Dover , Kent in 1844 , branching off the rival London , Brighton and South Coast Railway 's ( LBSC ) line at Redhill . Construction of a single line branch from Tunbridge ( modern spelling " Tonbridge " [ Note 2 ] ) to Tunbridge Wells , a fashionable town where a chalybeate spring had been discovered in 1606 , began in July 1844 . At the time , Parliament had not given assent for the railway . The Act of Parliament enabling the construction of the line had its first reading in the House of Commons on 28 April 1845 . The bill completed its passage through the House of Commons and the House of Lords on 28 July , following which Royal Assent was granted on 31 July by Queen Victoria . 
 The engineer in charge of the construction was Peter W. Barlow and the contractors were Messrs. Hoof & Son . In April 1845 the SER decided that the branch would be double track . A 410 @-@ yard @-@ long ( 370 m ) tunnel was required 44 chains ( 890 m ) after leaving Tunbridge . This was named " Somerhill Tunnel " after the nearby mansion . A mile and 54 chains ( 2 @.@ 70 km ) after leaving Somerhill Tunnel , a 270 @-@ yard @-@ long ( 250 m ) viaduct was required . Southborough Viaduct stands 40 feet ( 12 m ) high and has 26 arches . A temporary station was built at Tunbridge Wells as the 823 yd ( 753 m ) Wells Tunnel was still under construction . It was 4 miles 7 chains ( 6 @.@ 58 km ) from Tunbridge . The temporary station subsequently became a goods station . The first train , comprising four locomotives and 26 carriages , arrived at Tunbridge Wells on 19 September . Trains from Tunbridge had to reverse before starting the climb to Somerhill Tunnel , as there was no facing junction at Tunbridge . This situation was to remain until 1857 , when a direct link was built at a cost of £ 5 @,@ 700 . The old link remained in use until c . 1913 . 
 The SER was granted permission to build a line from Ashford in Kent to St Leonards , East Sussex in 1845 . The LBSC reached St Leonards from Lewes the following year . This gave the LBSC a shorter route to Hastings than the SERs route , then still under construction . The SER sought permission to extend their branch from Tunbridge Wells across the High Weald to reach Hastings . Authorisation for the construction of a 25 @-@ mile @-@ 60 @-@ chain ( 41 @.@ 44 km ) line to Hastings was obtained on 18 June 1846 , Parliament deemed the line between Ashford and St Leonards to be of military strategic importance . Therefore , they stipulated that this line was to be completed before any extension was built from Tunbridge Wells . The extension into Tunbridge Wells opened on 25 November 1846 without any public ceremony . In 1847 , the SER unsuccessfully challenged the condition that the line between Ashford and St Leonards be completed first . That line was opened in 1851 , passing through Hastings and making an end @-@ on junction with the LBSC line from Lewes . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The Hastings Line is built over the difficult , forested , and hilly terrain across the High Weald and sandstone Hastings Beds , necessitating the construction of eight tunnels between Tonbridge and the south coast seaside resort of Hastings . The SER was anxious to construct the line as economically as possible , since it was in competition with the LBSC to obtain entry into Hastings and was not in a strong financial position in the mid 1840s . 
 The construction of the line between Tunbridge Wells and Robertsbridge was contracted to Messrs. Hoof & <unk> , subcontracted to Messrs. H. Warden . By March 1851 , the trackbed had been constructed as far as Whatlington , East Sussex , a distance of 19 miles ( 30 @.@ 58 km ) . All tunnels had been completed and a single line of railway had been laid for a distance of 10 miles 40 chains ( 16 @.@ 90 km ) from Tunbridge Wells . When the 15 @-@ mile @-@ 40 @-@ chain ( 24 @.@ 94 km ) section from Tunbridge Wells to Robertsbridge opened on 1 September , a single line of track extended a further 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 44 km ) to Whatlington . On the 6 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 66 km ) section between Whatlington and St Leonards , 750 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 570 @,@ 000 m3 ) out of 827 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 632 @,@ 000 m3 ) had been excavated . Construction of the line between Tunbridge Wells and Bopeep Junction cost in excess of £ 500 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Deficiencies in the construction of the tunnels = = = 
 Supervision of the construction was lax , which enabled the contractors to skimp on the lining of the tunnels . This manifested itself in March 1855 when part of the brickwork of Mountfield Tunnel collapsed . An inspection of Grove Hill , Strawberry Hill and Wells tunnels revealed that they too had been constructed with too few layers of bricks . Grove Hill Tunnel had been built with just a single ring of bricks and no filling above the crown of the brickwork . The SER took the contractors to court and were awarded £ 3 @,@ 500 in damages . However , rectifying the situation cost the company £ 4 @,@ 700 . Although the contractors had charged for six rings of bricks , they had only used four . Due to the cost of <unk> the tunnels , this had to be rectified by the addition of a further two rings of brickwork , reducing the width of the tunnels by 18 inches ( 460 mm ) . The result of this was that the loading gauge on the line was restricted , and special rolling stock had to be built , later becoming known as Restriction 0 rolling stock . This problem would affect the line until 1986 . 
 Wadhurst Tunnel collapsed in 1862 and it was discovered by the SER that the same situation existed there too . Rectification cost £ 10 @,@ 231 . By 1877 , only one train was permitted in Bopeep Tunnel at a time . The tunnel was partly widened in 1934 – 35 . In November 1949 , serious defects were discovered in the tunnel . Single @-@ line working was put in place on 19 November , but the tunnel had to be closed completely a week later . The tunnel was partially relined with cast iron segments . It reopened to traffic on 5 June 1950 . Mountfield Tunnel was underpinned in 1938 – 39 , remaining open with single @-@ line working in operation . It partially collapsed on 17 November 1974 , resulting in single @-@ line working until 31 January 1975 . The line was then closed until 17 March whilst the track was singled through the tunnel . 
 = = = Openings = = = 
 The line was opened by the SER in three main stages : From Tunbridge – Tunbridge Wells , Tunbridge Wells – Robertsbridge and Robertsbridge – Bopeep Junction . A temporary station was opened at Tunbridge Wells on 19 September 1845 while Wells Tunnel was completed . The temporary station later became the goods depot . Tunbridge Wells ( later Tunbridge Wells Central ) station opened on 25 November 1846 . The Tunbridge Wells – Robertsbridge section opened on 1 September 1851 , with the Robertsbridge – Battle section opening on 1 January 1852 . The Battle – Bopeep Junction section opened on 1 February 1852 .

 The line climbs steeply out of the Medway Valley at gradients of between 1 in 47 [ Note 3 ] and 1 in 300 to a summit south of Tunbridge Wells , the line undulates as far as Wadhurst at gradients between 1 in 80 and 1 in 155 before descending into the Rother Valley , which it follows as far as Robertsbridge at gradients between 1 in 48 and 1 in 485 . The line then climbs at gradients between 1 in 86 and 1 in 170 before a dip where it crosses the River Brede . This is followed by a climb to Battle with gradients between 1 in 100 and 1 in 227 before the line falls to Hastings at gradients of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 945 . 
 Bopeep Junction is the junction of the Hastings Line with the East Coastway Line . It lies east of Bopeep Tunnel . There is a pub in <unk> called The Bo Peep . The name was a nickname for Customs and Excise men .

 = = = Stations = = = 
 The original stations on the Tunbridge Wells to Hastings section of the line are mostly in the Gothic or Italianate styles . These were designed by William Tress . Frant , Wadhurst , Witherenden , Etchingham and Robertsbridge stations opened on 1 September 1851 . Other station openings are detailed below . Stations are listed under their original names . 
 Tunbridge 
 Tunbridge station had opened in May 1842 . Following the opening of the branch to Tunbridge Wells in 1845 , it was renamed Tunbridge Junction in January 1852 . The original station stood to the east of the road bridge , whereas the current station , opened in 1864 , stands to the west . Trains leaving Tunbridge had to reverse to reach Tunbridge Wells . This arrangement lasted until 1857 , when a new section of line was constructed enabling trains to reach the Hastings Line without reversal . The station is 29 miles 42 chains ( 47 @.@ 52 km ) from Charing Cross via Orpington . 
 Southborough 
 Southborough station opened on 1 March 1893 . It was renamed High Brooms on 21 September 1925 to avoid confusion with Southborough station on the Chatham Main Line , which had already been renamed Bickley . The station is 32 miles 70 chains ( 52 @.@ 91 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Tunbridge Wells 
 The first station at Tunbridge Wells was temporary and was situated north of Wells Tunnel . It opened on 19 September 1845 and was replaced by the present Tunbridge Wells Station on 25 November 1846 . It subsequently became Tunbridge Wells Goods station , later renamed Tunbridge Wells Central Goods station . The goods station closed in 1980 , with a siding retained for engineers use . The original station was 44 miles 23 chains ( 71 @.@ 27 km ) from London Bridge via Redhill . [ Note 4 ] 
 The building on the up side of the station was built in the Italianate style . A new building by A. H. Blomfield was constructed on the down side in 1911 . The station was renamed Tunbridge Wells Central on 9 July 1923 with the ex @-@ LBSC station being renamed Tunbridge Wells West . Following the closure of the Tunbridge Wells – Eridge railway on 6 July 1985 , the name reverted to Tunbridge Wells . The station is 34 miles 32 chains ( 55 @.@ 36 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Frant 
 Frant station is 36 miles 53 chains ( 59 @.@ 00 km ) from Charing Cross . The station building is on the down side . 
 Wadhurst 
 Wadhurst station is 39 miles 23 chains ( 63 @.@ 23 km ) from Charing Cross . The station building is in the Italianate style , with a later one @-@ bay extension . The 1893 @-@ built signal box , decommissioned on 20 April 1986 , was purchased by the Kent and East Sussex Railway . 
 Witherenden 
 Witherenden station is 43 miles 66 chains ( 70 @.@ 53 km ) from Charing Cross . It was renamed Ticehurst Road in December 1851 , and Stonegate on 16 June 1947 . 
 Etchingham 
 Etchingham station is 47 miles 34 chains ( 76 @.@ 32 km ) from Charing Cross . The building is on the up side . 
 Robertsbridge 
 Robertsbridge station is 49 miles 37 chains ( 79 @.@ 60 km ) from Charing Cross . On 26 March 1900 , it became a junction with the opening of the Rother Valley Railway to freight . The line opened to passengers on 2 April 1900 , and was renamed the Kent and East Sussex Railway in 1904 . The Kent and East Sussex Railway closed to passengers on 2 January 1954 and to freight on 12 June 1962 , except for a short section serving a mill at Robertsbridge which closed on 1 January 1970 . 
 Mountfield Halt 
 Mountfield Halt opened in 1923 . It closed on 6 October 1969 . The platforms were built of sleepers and were demolished in the early 1970s . The station was 53 miles 37 chains ( 86 @.@ 04 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Battle 
 Battle station opened on 1 September 1851 . The buildings are in the Gothic style and stand on the up side . The station is 55 miles 46 chains ( 89 @.@ 44 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Crowhurst 
 A siding had existed at Crowhurst from 1877 . The station opened on 1 June 1902 and was located at the junction for the Bexhill West Branch Line , which also opened the same day . Despite the line 's closure on 14 June 1964 , Crowhurst station remains open . The station is 57 miles 45 chains ( 92 @.@ 64 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 West St Leonards 
 West St Leonards station opened on 1 October 1887 . The buildings are wood framed and covered with weatherboards . The station is 60 miles 59 chains ( 97 @.@ 75 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 St Leonards Warrior Square 
 St Leonards Warrior Square station opened on 13 February 1851 along with a new section of line between Hastings and the LBSCs Hastings & St Leonards station . This gave the LBSC better access to Hastings . It lies between Bopeep Tunnel and Hastings Tunnel . The station is 61 miles 55 chains ( 99 @.@ 28 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Hastings 
 Hastings station opened on 13 February 1851 along with the SER branch from Ashford . The station was rebuilt and enlarged by the SER in 1880 as it was then inadequate for the increasing seasonal traffic . In 1930 the station was rebuilt by the Southern Railway . This entailed closure of the engine sheds at Hastings , with locomotives being transferred to St Leonards . The original station building , by Tress , was demolished and a new Neo @-@ Georgian station building by J. R. Scott was erected . The rebuilt station was completed on 5 July 1931 . The station was rebuilt in 2003 by Railtrack . The 1931 @-@ built building was demolished and a new structure erected in its place . The station is 62 miles 33 chains ( 100 @.@ 44 km ) from Charing Cross via Orpington .

 In the late 1860s , a single track link was built between the SERs Tunbridge Wells station and the LBSCs Tunbridge Wells station , which had opened in 1866 . It was 1875 before powers were granted to run a passenger service over this section of line . The junction with the main line was Grove Junction . It was removed on 7 July 1985 , following closure of the Tunbridge Wells Central – Eridge line the previous day . 
 In 1900 , the Rother Valley Railway opened from Robertsbridge to Tenterden . It was extended in stages to Tenterden Town and Headcorn , which was reached in 1905 . The line closed to passengers on 2 January 1954 and freight on 12 June 1961 , except for access to Hodson 's Mill closed in 1970 . The Rother Valley Railway heritage railway are rebuilding the line between Robertsbridge and Junction Road , with completion scheduled by 2018 . In 1902 , a branch line was built to Bexhill West , with a new station at the junction with the main line at Crowhurst . This line closed on 14 June 1964 . 
 = = = = Authorised = = = = 
 In 1903 , a railway was authorised to be built from Robertsbridge to Pevensey , East Sussex . The line was authorised under the Light Railways Act 1896 , but was not constructed . 
 = = = = Proposed = = = = 
 In 1856 , it was proposed to build a 6 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 66 km ) long branch from Witherenden to Mayfield , East Sussex . [ Note 5 ] In 1882 , an 18 @-@ mile @-@ 40 @-@ chain ( 29 @.@ 77 km ) long railway was proposed from Ticehurst Road to Langney , East Sussex , giving access to Eastbourne . Stations were proposed at Burwash , Dallington , Bodle Street Green , Boreham Street , Pevensey and Langney . 
 = = = Planned electrification = = = 
 Electrification of the Hastings Line was first considered by the SER as early as 1903 . Lack of finance meant that no decision had been made by the time World War I broke out in 1914 . It was stated in 1921 that electrification was a long term aim . In the mid @-@ 1930s , the Southern Railway , which had been formed from the SER , LBSC , London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) and London , Chatham and Dover Railway ( LCDR ) in 1923 under the Railways Act 1921 , electrified a number of lines . The East Coastway Line was electrified in 1935 , with a depot being built at Ore , East Sussex . In 1937 , it was proposed to electrify the line between Sevenoaks and St Leonards Warrior Square at a cost of £ 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . The scheme was deferred , with another proposal in 1937 costing £ 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 also failing to gain favour before World War II broke out . One of the main reasons that electrification was not given the go @-@ ahead was the fact that non @-@ standard rolling stock would be required . The Southern Railway had provided the line with 104 new carriages and six Pullman Cars between 1929 and 1934 . Two electric locomotives were ordered in 1937 . They were built to the Hastings Line loading gauge . 
 In October 1946 , the Southern Railway announced a programme to electrify all lines in Kent and East Sussex in three stages . The Hastings Line between Tonbridge and Bopeep Junction was to be part of the third stage . Track would have been slewed within the affected tunnels with only one train normally allowed in the tunnel . In an emergency , two trains would be allowed in the tunnel at the same time , but restricted to 25 miles per hour ( 40 km / h ) . Standard 9 feet 0 inches ( 2 @.@ 74 m ) wide stock would be used . Following the nationalisation of railways in the United Kingdom under the Transport Act 1947 , the Southern Region of British Railways shelved new electrification schemes , concentrating on the construction of new steam locomotives . In 1952 , the possibility of operating standard rolling stock on the line had been examined . The Operating Department objected to the use of single line sections through the various tunnels . The 1930s stock was refurbished with the aim of extending its service by a further ten years . The first two phases of the Southern Railways ' electrification scheme were revived in 1955 . This did not include the Hastings Line and it was announced in 1956 that a fleet of diesel @-@ electric trains would be constructed to operate the service until the line was electrified . At that time , the rolling stock built in the 1930s was overdue for replacement . The modernisation to the Hastings Line and the introduction of the diesel @-@ electric trains cost £ 797 @,@ 000 , of which £ 595 @,@ 000 was the cost of the first seven trains . A further thirteen trains cost £ 1 @,@ 178 @,@ 840 . 
 Electrification was finally carried out in the 1980s , as detailed below . 
 = = Operators = = 
 From 1845 , the line was operated by the SER . In 1899 , the SER and LCDR entered into a joint working partnership , the South Eastern and Chatham Railway ( SECR ) . On 1 January 1923 , the Railways Act 1921 came into force , resulting in the Grouping . The SECR became part of the Southern Railway ( SR ) . On 1 January 1948 , the Transport Act 1947 came into force , and the SR became part of British Railways , with the former SR lines becoming the Southern Region . British Railways was rebranded British Rail on 1 January 1965 . On 10 June 1986 , Network <unk> branded trains began operating . On 1 January 1994 , the Railways Act 1993 came into force , privatising British Rail . Passenger services were taken over by Connex South Eastern on 13 October 1996 . On 27 June 2003 , Connex lost the franchise due to poor financial management . The Strategic Rail Authority took over the running of passenger trains from 9 November 2003 , using their South Eastern Trains train operating company . On 1 April 2006 , Southeastern took over the operation of passenger trains on the route .

 From the opening of the line , passenger stock consisted of 4 @-@ wheel carriages . In 1845 , there were eight passenger trains a day from Tunbridge Wells to London , with half that number on Sundays . On 23 June 1849 , the Royal Train took Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to Tunbridge Wells to visit Queen Adelaide , the Queen Dowager . The train , consisting of the Royal Saloon , two first class carriages and a brake van made the journey from Bricklayers Arms to Tunbridge Wells in 75 minutes . It was driven by James Cudworth , the Locomotive Superintendent of the SER . The return journey took 70 minutes . The Royal Train visited the line again on 18 December 1849 conveying Queen Victoria and Princess Alice from Windsor , Berkshire to Tunbridge Wells on a visit to Princess Louise . The journey via Waterloo took 100 minutes . The train was driven by William <unk> , Resident Engineer of the LSWR , and Edgar <unk> , Superintendent of the LSWR . At Waterloo , driving of the train was taken over by John Shaw , General Manager of the SER and Mr. Cockburn , Superintendent of the SER . The return journey took 105 minutes . 
 With the opening of the extension to Robertsbridge , there were three trains a day , with two on Sundays . These were augmented by an additional train daily when the extension to Bopeep Junction opened . In 1860 , there were seven up trains and six down trains daily ; Hastings to London via Redhill taking two hours . From 1861 , Cudworth 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 " Little Mail " class locomotives were introduced . In 1876 , the Sub @-@ Wealden Gypsum Co built a 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) long line from a junction south of Mountfield Tunnel to a gypsum mine located in Great Wood , Mountfield . This line was still in operation as of 2007 . Bogie carriages entered service on the line in 1880 . In 1890 , the winter service was eleven trains each way , of which five were fast . [ Note 6 ] An additional two trains daily operated between Tunbridge Wells and Wadhurst . By 1910 , this had increased to twenty trains each way , of which twelve were fast , plus the extra two Wadhurst services . Four trains ran on Sundays . The service was reduced during World War I , but Sunday services had increased to seven by 1922 . 
 By the 1930s the line was worked by L and L1 class 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 locomotives . The Schools class 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0s were introduced in 1930 ; the width of these was 8 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 54 m ) measured across the cab , and 8 feet 6 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 604 m ) measured across the cylinders . The service was again reduced during World War II , with fourteen trains daily in 1942 , of which four were fast ; there were seven trains on Sundays . As built , it was envisaged that the West Country and Battle of Britain class locomotives would be able to work the line . Forty @-@ eight locomotives of the West Country and 22 of the Battle of Britain class were built with cabs that were 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 59 m ) wide and paired with tenders of the same width . It was subsequently decided not to work these locomotives over the line . Locomotives from these two classes that were rebuilt gained a 9 @-@ foot @-@ 0 @-@ inch @-@ wide ( 2 @.@ 74 m ) cab . Unrebuilt locomotives retained their narrow cab . 
 By 1948 , the service was sixteen trains , of which seven were fast . An additional three trains ran as far as Wadhurst . In 1957 , the service was eighteen trains daily , of which nine were fast . There were nine trains on Sundays . The Schools Class locomotives worked the line until 1957 when steam was withdrawn on the Hastings Line . Diesel @-@ electric multiple units of what became British Rail Class 201 , 202 and 203 ( the " Hastings Diesels " ) took over working the route . 
 Under British Railways , classes D1 , E1 , H , N1 , M7 , Q , Q1 , Std 3 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 2T , Std 4 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 Std 4 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 4T and U1 were permitted to work between Tonbridge and Grove junction . Freight trains from Tonbridge West Yard were not permitted to depart until the line was clear as far as Southborough Viaduct . Other classes of locomotive known to have worked over this section of line include C , and E4 . 
 = = = Diesel @-@ electric era ( 1957 – 86 ) = = = 
 Special narrow bodied diesel electric multiple units were introduced in 1957 – 58 to replace steam traction . British Rail Class 201 ( 6S ) , 202 ( 6L ) and 203 ( 6B ) ( the " Hastings Diesels " ) took over working the route . These units were constructed of narrow rolling stock . They were delivered in six @-@ car formations ( the 6Bs including a buffet car ) and two units were often operated in multiple to form twelve @-@ car trains . In latter years some of the units were reduced to five , and later still , to four cars . 
 The 6S units were intended to be introduced into service in June 1957 . On 5 April a fire at Cannon Street signal box disabled all signalling equipment there . As a result , locomotive @-@ hauled trains were banned from the station . A temporary signal box was commissioned on 5 May and the 6S units were introduced on peak services the next day . Two units coupled together formed the 06 : 58 and 07 : 26 Hastings – Cannon Street services in the morning , and the 17 : 18 and 18 : 03 Cannon Street – Hastings services in the evening . From 17 June the 6S and 6L units were working services throughout the day . The 6B units entered service between May and August 1958 . 
 The Hastings Diesels had almost completely replaced steam by June 1958 . With the introduction of the Hastings Diesels , an hourly service was provided . This split at Tunbridge Wells , with the front portion running fast to Crowhurst and the rear portion stopping at all stations . The service ran every two hours on Sundays . The Hastings Diesels also worked services on the Bexhill West Branch Line until closure on 14 June 1964 . On 22 December 1958 , 6L unit 1017 collided with 6B unit 1035 at Tunbridge Wells Central . 
 In 1962 , twelve Class 33 / 2 diesel locomotives , were also built with narrow bodies for the Hastings line . These enabled the last steam workings , overnight newspaper trains , to be withdrawn from the Hastings Line . Nineteen British Rail Class 207 ( 3D ) diesel electric multiple units were built in 1962 . They operated over the Tonbridge – Grove Junction section of the line as part of a Tonbridge – Eastbourne ( later Tonbridge – Eridge ) service . In 1963 , Frant , Stonegate , Wadhurst and Mountfield Halt were proposed to be closed under the Beeching Axe . One special working took place on 3 April 1966 when one of the ex @-@ Great Western Railway diesel railcars , <unk> , was worked between Tonbridge and Robertsbridge as an out of gauge load . The railcar had been purchased by the Kent and East Sussex Railway for £ 415 including delivery to Robertsbridge . After trying to " wriggle out " of the deal , British Rail eventually found a solution . The vehicle was ballasted so that it leant away from the tunnel walls by some 3 inches ( 80 mm ) and was worked to Robertsbridge at a maximum of 20 miles per hour ( 32 km / h ) . From 1977 , there were two trains an hour , one fast and one slow . In May 1980 , the buffet cars were withdrawn from the 6B units , which were recoded as 5L , but retaining the Class 203 designation . The fast trains were withdrawn in January 1981 , with trains now stopping at all stations . 
 = = = Electric era ( since 1986 ) = = = 
 On 28 October 1983 , it was announced that the Hastings Line was to be electrified . Reasons that decided the issue included a commitment by British Rail to eliminate asbestos from all stock in service by 1988 and the increasing cost of maintaining the then ageing Hastings Diesels . The scheme was to cost £ 23 @,@ 925 @,@ 000 . Electrification was finally completed in 1986 , the line was electrified using 750 V DC third rail using standard rolling stock , and the expedient of singling the track through the narrow tunnels . The tunnels either side of Tunbridge Wells Central station were not singled because the fact that the south portal of Wells Tunnel and north portal of Grove Hill Tunnel were at the ends of the platforms meant it was impossible to install pointwork without reducing the length of platform available . A speed restriction was imposed through Wells Tunnel . Parliamentary powers were sought in 1979 to bore a second Grove Hill Tunnel , but there was much opposition from local residents . This , and the high cost , caused the proposal to be abandoned . The track in Grove Hill Tunnel was relaid on a concrete base , allowing alignment to be precisely controlled . 
 The line was declared to conform to the standard C1 loading gauge on 14 March . The first passenger carrying train comprising C1 stock to use the line was a railtour on 15 March hauled by 50 025 Invincible . It was organised by the Southern Electric Group and ran from Paddington to Folkestone Harbour . A preview service of electric trains ran on 27 April 1986 and the full timetabled service commenced on 12 May 1986 . The next day , a wrong @-@ side failure occurred involving three signals between Tonbridge and Hastings . Contractors had made errors in the wiring of the signal heads . With the inauguration of electric services , a half @-@ hourly service was operated , with trains departing from Charing Cross at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour . Those departing at xx : 15 called at Waterloo East , Sevenoaks , Tonbridge , High Brooms , Tunbridge Wells , Wadhurst , Battle , St Leonards Warrior Square and Hastings , taking 84 minutes . Those departing at xx : 45 called at Waterloo East , London Bridge , Orpington , Sevenoaks , <unk> , Tonbridge and then all stations to Hastings , taking 99 minutes . The Royal Train visited the line on 6 May , conveying Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother . It was stabled at Wadhurst whilst she ate lunch . The train was hauled by a Class 73 diesel @-@ electric locomotive . Upon electrification , services were operated by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> electric multiple units . Class 508 electric multiple units also operated services on the line . When these units were withdrawn in the mid @-@ 2000s , they were replaced by Class 375 Electrostar , Class 465 Networker and Class 466 Networker units . 
 Train services on the line are provided by Southeastern , and are mostly operated by Class 375 Electrostar , or occasionally Class 465 / 466 Networker units . The line still sees a freight service to and from British Gypsum 's sidings at Mountfield . 
 = = Accidents and incidents = = 
 A number of accidents have occurred on the Hastings Line , none of which have involved the death of a passenger . 
 On 4 October 1852 , a passenger train was derailed between Ticehurst Road and Etchingham when the formation was flooded and washed away . Both engine crew members were injured . 
 On 21 June 1856 , a passenger train derailed between Tunbridge Wells and Tunbridge Junction , killing the driver and injuring the fireman and a passenger . 
 On 30 September 1866 , the slip portion of a train , which was to be worked forwards to Hastings , failed to stop at Tunbridge due to an error by the slip guard . It crashed into a rake of empty carriages 262 yards ( 240 m ) east of the station . Eleven of the 40 passengers were injured . 
 On 22 February 1892 , a SER locomotive was run into by a LBSC passenger train at Hastings . The passenger train had overrun a danger signal . Both locomotives were damaged . 
 On 29 August 1896 , the locomotive of a Charing Cross to Hastings train was derailed near Etchingham when it collided with a traction engine and threshing machine using an occupation crossing . 
 On 29 April 1912 , SECR F1 class locomotive No. 216 was working an empty stock train when it suffered the failure of the firebox crown near Tunbridge Wells due to a lack of water in the boiler . Both engine crew were severely injured by escaping steam and jumping from the moving locomotive . 
 On 6 January 1930 , the rear carriages of a passenger train from Hastings to London were partially buried by a landslip near Wadhurst tunnel . The train was divided and the front part continued on to Tunbridge Wells , where it arrived 100 minutes late . 
 On 23 December 1958 , 6L unit 1017 collided with 6B unit 1035 at Tunbridge Wells Central . Eighteen people were injured , with three of them admitted to hospital . 
 On 8 November 2010 , a passenger train operated by Class 375 unit 375 711 failed to stop at Stonegate station due to maintenance errors in respect of the train 's sanding apparatus . The train overran the station by 2 miles 36 chains ( 3 @.@ 94 km ) . Following the incident , Southeastern reduced the interval that the sand hoppers were to be refilled from seven days to five days . The company was fined £ 65 @,@ 000 and ordered to pay £ 22 @,@ 589 in costs . 
 On 23 December 2013 , a landslip at Wadhurst was the first in a series of landslips up to February 2014 which led the line between Wadhurst and St. Leonards Warrior Square being closed and reopened three times , with speed restrictions in place following repairs . The train service was replaced by buses during closures . Southeastern was criticised by Hastings and Rye MP Amber Rudd over poor customer service during this period . By 12 March , the section between Wadhurst and Robertsbridge had reopened , with full service being restored on 31 March . 
 = Music of Final Fantasy IV = 
 The music of the video game Final Fantasy IV was composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu . The Final Fantasy IV Original Sound Version , a compilation of almost all of the music in the game , was released by Square Co . / NTT Publishing , and subsequently re @-@ released by NTT Publishing . It was released in North America by Tokyopop as Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack : Music from Final Fantasy Chronicles , with one additional track . It has since been re @-@ released multiple times with slight changes as part of the Final Fantasy Finest Box and as Final Fantasy IV DS OST . An arranged album entitled Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon , containing a selection of musical tracks from the game performed in the style of Celtic music by Máire Breatnach , was released by Square and later re @-@ released by NTT Publishing . Additionally , a collection of piano arrangements composed by Nobuo Uematsu and played by Toshiyuki Mori titled Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV was released by NTT Publishing . 
 The music was overall well received ; reviewers have praised the quality of the original composition despite the limitations of the medium , and reacted favorably to the arranged soundtracks . Several tracks , especially " Theme of Love " , remain popular today , and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series , as well as been published in arranged and compilation albums by Square as well as outside groups . 
 = = Concept and creation = = 
 Uematsu has noted that the process of composing was excruciating , involving trial and error and requiring the sound staff to spend several nights in sleeping bags at Square Co. headquarters . He blamed much of the problem on the fact that this was his first soundtrack to use the new Super Famicom hardware , as opposed to his previous soundtracks composed for the Famicom . The liner notes for the Final Fantasy IV OSV album were humorously signed as being written at 1 : 30 AM " in the office , naturally . " Uematsu has stated that , beginning with the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IV , he started to move away from the idea that the soundtrack had to be solely an orchestral score . In June 2007 , Square Enix held a casting for a vocalist to sing a version of Final Fantasy IV 's " Theme of Love " rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu . Megumi Ida was selected from approximately 800 applicants to perform the song , which was featured on the Japanese Nintendo DS remake of the game , as well as the accompanying soundtrack album .

However , the length of several tracks as well as of the album as a whole was criticized , with reviewers finding it " too short " and disapproving of the early fade @-@ out of some tracks .

The album has the catalog number SQEX @-@ <unk> ~ 4 , and its 57 tracks have a duration of 1 : 32 : 40 . Joshua Bateman of RPGFan stated that while the remaster edition wasn 't strictly necessary , given that Square Enix still sold the original version online , the new edition was still a superior version and an important step in preserving classic video game music .

 = Pool of Radiance = 
 Pool of Radiance is a role @-@ playing video game developed and published by Strategic Simulations , Inc ( SSI ) in 1988 . It was the first adaptation of TSR 's Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ( AD & D or D & D ) fantasy role @-@ playing game for home computers , becoming the first episode in a four @-@ part series of D & D computer adventure games . The other games in the " Gold Box " series used the game engine pioneered in Pool of Radiance , as did later D & D titles such as the Neverwinter Nights online game . Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting , with the action centered in and around the port city of Phlan . 
 Just as in traditional D & D games , the player starts by building a party of up to six characters , deciding the race , sex , class and ability scores for each . The player 's party is enlisted to help the settled part of the city by clearing out the marauding inhabitants that have taken over the surroundings . The characters move on from one area to another , battling bands of enemies as they go and ultimately confronting the powerful leader of the evil forces . During play the player characters gain experience points , which allow them to increase their capabilities . The game primarily uses a first @-@ person perspective , with the screen divided into sections to display pertinent textual information . During combat sequences , the display switches to a top @-@ down " video game isometric " view . 
 Generally well received by the gaming press , Pool of Radiance won the Origins Award for " Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988 " . Some reviewers criticized the game 's similarities to other contemporary games and its slowness in places , but praised the game 's graphics and its role @-@ playing adventure and combat aspects . Also well @-@ regarded was the ability to export player characters from Pool of Radiance to subsequent SSI games in the series . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Pool of Radiance is based on the same game mechanics as the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set . As in many role @-@ playing games ( RPGs ) , each player character in Pool of Radiance has a character race and a character class , determined at the beginning of the game . Six races are offered , including elves and halflings , as well as four classes ( fighter , cleric , wizard , and thief ) . Non @-@ human characters have the option to become multi @-@ classed , which means they gain the capabilities of more than one class , but advance in levels more slowly . During character creation , the computer randomly generates statistics for each character , although the player can alter these attributes . The player also chooses each character 's alignment , or moral philosophy ; while the player controls each character 's actions , alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions . The player can then customize the appearance and colors of each character 's combat icon . Alternatively , the player can load a pre @-@ generated party to be used for introductory play . These characters are combined into a party of six or less , with two slots open for NPCs . Players create their own save @-@ game files , assuring character continuation regardless of events in the game . On an MS @-@ DOS computer , the game can be copied to the hard @-@ disk drive . Other computer systems , such as the Commodore 64 , require a separate save @-@ game disk . 
 The game 's " exploration " mode uses a three @-@ dimensional first @-@ person perspective , with a rectangle in the top left of the screen displaying the party 's current view ; the rest of the screen displays text information about the party and the area . During gameplay , the player accesses menus to allow characters to use objects ; trade items with other characters ; parley with enemies ; buy , sell , and pool the characters ' money ; cast spells , and learn new magic skills . Players can view characters ' movement from different angles , including an aerial view . The game uses three different versions of each sprite to indicate differences between short- , medium- , and long @-@ range encounters . 
 In combat mode , the screen changes to a top @-@ down mode with <unk> projection , where the player decides what actions the characters will take in each round . These actions are taken immediately , rather than after all commands have been issued as is standard in some RPGs . <unk> , the player can let the computer choose character moves for each round . Characters and monsters may make an extra attack on a retreating enemy that moves next to them . If a character 's hit points ( HP ) fall below zero , he or she must be bandaged by another character or the character will die . The game contains random encounters , and game reviewers for Dragon magazine observed that random encounters seem to follow standard patterns of encounter tables in pen and paper AD & D game manuals . They also observed that the depictions of monsters confronting the party " looked as though they had jumped from the pages of the Monster Manual . " 
 Different combat options are available to characters based on class . For example , fighters can wield melee or ranged weapons ; magic @-@ users can cast spells ; thieves have the option to " back @-@ stab " an opponent by strategically positioning themselves . As fighters progress in level , they can attack more than once in a round . Fighters also gain the ability to " sweep " enemies , effectively attacking each nearby low @-@ level creature in the same turn . Magic @-@ users and clerics are allowed to memorize and cast a set number of spells each day . Once cast , a spell must be memorized again before reuse . The process requires hours of inactivity for all characters , during which they rest in a camp ; this also restores lost hit points to damaged characters . This chore of memorizing spells each night significantly added to the amount of game management required by the player . 
 As characters defeat enemies , they gain experience points ( XP ) . After gaining enough XP , the characters " train up a level " to become more powerful . This training is purchased in special areas within the city walls . In addition to training , mages can learn new spells by transcribing them from scrolls found in the unsettled areas . Defeated enemies in these areas also contain items such as weapons and armor , which characters can sell to city stores .

 Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy world , in and about the city of Phlan . This is located on the northern shore of the Moonsea along the Barren River , between <unk> Keep and <unk> . The party begins in the civilized section of " New Phlan " that is governed by a council . This portion of the city hosts businesses , including shopkeepers who sell holy items for each temple 's worshipers , a jewelry shop , and retailers who provide arms and armor . A party can also contract with the clerk of the city council for various commissions ; proclamations fastened to the halls within City Hall offer bits of information to aid the party . These coded clues can be deciphered by using the Adventurer 's Journal , included with the game . 
 There are three temples within Phlan , each dedicated to different gods . Each temple can heal those who are wounded , poisoned , or afflicted , and can fully restore deceased comrades for a high price . The party can also visit the hiring hall and hire an experienced NPC adventurer to accompany the party . Encounters with NPCs in shops and taverns offer valuable information . Listening to gossip in taverns can be helpful to characters , although some tavern tales are false and lead characters into great danger . 
 = = = Plot summary = = = 
 The ancient trade city of Phlan has fallen into impoverished ruin . Now only a small portion of the city remains inhabited by humans , who are surrounded by evil creatures . To rebuild the city and clean up the Barren River , the city council of New Phlan has decided to recruit adventurers to drive the monsters from the neighboring ruins . Using bards and publications , they spread tales of the riches waiting to be recovered in Phlan , which draws the player 's party to these shores by ship . 
 At the start of the game , the adventurers ' ship lands in New Phlan , and they receive a brief but informative tour of the civilized area . They learn that the city is plagued with a history of invasions and wars and has been overtaken by a huge band of humanoids and other creatures . Characters hear rumors that a single controlling element is in charge of these forces . The characters begin a block @-@ by @-@ block quest to rid the ruins of monsters and evil spirits . 
 Beyond the ruins of old Phlan , the party enters the slum area — one of two quests immediately available to new parties . This quest requires the clearing of the slum block and allows a new party to quickly gain experience . The second quest is to clear out Sokol Keep , located on Thorn Island . This fortified area is inhabited by the undead , which can only be defeated with silver weapons and magic . The characters ' adventure is later expanded to encompass the outlying areas of the Moonsea region . Eventually , the player learns that an evil spirit named <unk> , who has possessed an ancient dragon , is at the root of Phlan 's problems . The characters fight <unk> the <unk> One in a climactic final battle .

 = = = Development = = = 
 Pool of Radiance was the first official game based on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules . The scenario was created by TSR designers Jim Ward , David Cook , Steve Winter , and Mike <unk> , and coded by programmers from Strategic Simulations , Inc 's Special Projects team . The section of the Forgotten Realms world in which Pool of Radiance takes place was intended to be developed only by SSI . The game was created on Apple II and Commodore 64 computers , taking one year with a team of thirty @-@ five people . This game was the first to use the game engine later used in other SSI D & D games known as the " Gold Box " series . The SSI team developing the game was led by Chuck Kroegel . Kroegel stated that the main challenge with the development was interpreting the AD & D rules to an exact format . Developers also worked to balance the graphics with gameplay to provide a faithful AD & D feel , given the restrictions of a home computer . In addition to the core AD & D manuals , the books Unearthed Arcana and Monster Manual II were also used during development . The images of monsters were adapted directly from the Monster Manual book . The game was originally programmed by Keith <unk> and Brad Myers , and it was developed by George MacDonald . The game 's graphic arts were by Tom Wahl , Fred Butts , Darla <unk> , and Susan <unk> . 
 Pool of Radiance was released in June 1988 ; it was initially available on the Commodore 64 , Apple II series and IBM PC compatible computers . A version for the Atari ST was also announced . The Macintosh version was released in 1989 . The Macintosh version featured a slightly different interface and was intended to work on black @-@ and @-@ white Macs like the Mac Plus and the Mac Classic . The screen was tiled into separate windows including the game screen , text console , and compass . Graphics were monochrome and the display window was relatively small compared to other versions . The Macintosh version featured sound , but no music . The game 's Amiga version was released two years later . The PC 9800 version 『 <unk> ・ オブ ・ <unk> 』 in Japan was fully translated ( like the Japanese Famicom version ) and featured full @-@ color graphics . The game was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System under the title Advanced Dungeons & Dragons : Pool of Radiance , released in April 1992 . 
 The original Pool of Radiance game shipped with a 28 @-@ page introductory booklet , which describes secrets relating to the game and the concepts behind it . The booklet guides players through the character creation process , explaining how to create a party . The game also included the 38 @-@ page Adventurer 's Journal , which provides the game 's background . The booklet features depictions of fliers , maps , and information that characters see in the game . The package also included a translation decoder wheel . After the title screen , a copy protection screen was displayed consisting of two pictures and a line . The player was required to use the decoder wheel to line up the pictures , then enter the word revealed on the decoder wheel . After three unsuccessful attempts , the game automatically shut down . 
 = = = Sequels and Legacy = = = 
 Pool of Radiance was the first in a four @-@ part series of computer D & D adventures set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting . The others were released by SSI one year apart : Curse of the Azure Bonds ( 1989 ) , Secret of the Silver Blades ( 1990 ) , and Pools of Darkness ( 1991 ) . The 1989 game Hillsfar was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to Pool of Radiance . Hillsfar is described instead , by the reviewers of Dragon , as " a value @-@ added adventure for those who would like to take a side trip while awaiting the sequel " . A player can import characters from Pool of Radiance into Hillsfar , although the characters are reduced to their basic levels and do not retain weapons or magical items . Original Hillsfar characters cannot be exported to Pool of Radiance , but they can be exported to Curse of the Azure Bonds . A review for Curse of the Azure Bonds in Computer Gaming World noted that " you can transfer your characters from Pool of Radiance and it 's a good idea to do so . It will give you a headstart in the game . " 
 GameSpot declared that Pool of Radiance , with its detailed art , wide variety of quests and treasure , and tactical combat system , and despite the availability of only four character classes and the low character level cap , " ultimately succeeded in its goal of bringing a standardized form of AD & D to the home computer , and laid the foundation for other future gold box AD & D role @-@ playing games " . Scott Battaglia of GameSpy said Pool of Radiance is " what many gamers consider to be the epitome of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons RPGs . These games were so great that people today are using <unk> in droves to slow down their Pentium III @-@ 1000 MHz enough to play these gems . " In March 2008 , <unk> listed Pool of Radiance among its 13 best electronic versions of Dungeons & Dragons . The contributor felt that " The Pool of Radiance series set the stage for Dungeons & Dragons to make a major splash in the video game world . " 
 The 1988 Dungeons & Dragons role @-@ playing game module Ruins of Adventure was produced using the same adventure scenario as Pool of Radiance , using the same plot , background , setting , and many of the same characters as the computer game . The module thus contains useful clues to the successful completion of the computer missions . Ruins of Adventure contains four linked <unk> , which form the core of Pool of Radiance . According to the editors of Dragon magazine , Pool of Radiance was based on Ruins of Adventure , and not vice versa .

 In November 1989 a novelization of Pool of Radiance the video game , also called Pool of Radiance , was written by James Ward and Jane Cooper Hong , published by TSR . The novel is set in the Forgotten Realms setting based on the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role @-@ playing game . Dragon described the novel 's plot : " Five companions find themselves in the unenviable position of defending the soon @-@ to @-@ be ghost town against a rival possessing incredible power .

 = = Reception = = 
 SSI sold 264 @,@ 536 copies of Pool of Radiance for computers in North America , three times that of Heroes of the Lance , an AD & D @-@ licensed action game SSI also released that year . It became by far the most successful game in the company 's history , and the best @-@ selling RPG created on an 8 @-@ bit computer platform ; even the hint book outsold any earlier SSI game . 
 In Computer Gaming World 's preview of Pool of Radiance in July 1988 , the writer noted a sense of deja vu . He described the similarity of the game 's screen to earlier computer RPGs . For example , the three @-@ dimensional maze view in the upper @-@ left window was similar to Might & Magic or Bard 's Tale , both released in the mid @-@ 1980s . The window with a listing of characters was featured in 1988 's Wasteland ; and the use of an active character to represent the party was part of Ultima V. The reviewer also noted that the design approach for game play was closer to SSI 's own Wizard 's Crown than to the other games in the genre . 
 Pool of Radiance received positive reviews . G.M. called the game 's graphics " good " and praised its role @-@ playing and combat aspects . They felt that " <unk> will find Pools is an essential purchase , but people who are solely computer games oriented may hesitate before buying it [ ... ] it will be their loss " . Tony Dillon from Commodore User giving it a score of 9 out of 10 . The only complaint was a slightly slow disk access , but the reviewer was impressed with the game 's features , awarding it a Commodore User superstar and proclaiming it " the best RPG ever to grace the C64 , or indeed any other computer " . Issue # 84 of the British magazine Computer + Video Games rated the game highly , saying that " Pools is a game which no role player or adventurer should be without and people new to role playing should seriously consider buying as an introductory guide " . Another UK publication , The Games Machine , gave the game an 89 % rating . The reviewer noted that the third @-@ person arcade style combat view is a great improvement for SSI , as they had traditionally incorporated simplistic graphics in their role @-@ playing games . The reviewer was critical that Pool of Radiance was not original in its presentation and that the colors were a little drab , but concluded that the game is " classic Dungeons & Dragons which SSI have recreated excellently " . A review from Zzap was less positive , giving the game a score of 80 % . The reviewer felt that the game required too much " hacking , slicing and chopping " without enough emphasis on puzzle solving . The game was awarded 49 % for its puzzle factor . 
 Three reviewers for Computer Gaming World had conflicting reactions . Ken St. Andre - designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG - approved of the game despite his dislike of the D & D system , praising the art , the mixture of combat and puzzles , and surprises . He concluded , " take it from a ' rival ' designer , Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role @-@ playing gamer " . Tracie Forman Hicks , however , stated that over @-@ faithful use of the D & D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry . She also disliked the game 's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences . Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a " well @-@ designed slicer / dicer " , concluding that " patience ( possibly of Job ) [ is ] required to get through this one " . Shay Addams from Compute ! stated that experienced role @-@ playing gamers " won 't find anything new here " , but recommended it to those who " love dungeons , dragons , and drama " . In their March 1989 " The Role of Computers " column in Dragon magazine # 143 , Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk Lesser ( often called " The Lessers " ) gave Pool of Radiance a three @-@ page review . The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as " the first offering that truly follows AD & D game rules " , calling it a " great fantasy role @-@ playing game " that " falls into the must @-@ buy category for avid AD & D game players " . The reviewers advised readers to " rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance " . They considered it SSI 's flagship product , speculating that it would " undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure @-@ filled worlds of TSR " . The Dragon reviewers criticized the " notoriously slow " technology of the C64 / 128 system but added that the C64 / 128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software @-@ based <unk> utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game . Conversely , the reviewers felt that the MS @-@ DOS version was extremely fast , so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on @-@ screen messages . They found that the MS @-@ DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64 / 128 version when using the Enhanced Graphics Adapter ( EGA ) graphics mode . 
 Alex Simmons , Doug Johns , and Andy Mitchell reviewed the Amiga version of Pool of Radiance for Amiga Action magazine in 1990 , giving it a 79 % overall rating . Mitchell preferred the game Champions of Krynn , which had been released by the time the Amiga version of Pool of Radiance became available ; he felt that Pool of Radiance was " more of the same " when compared to Champions , but was less playable and with more limited actions for players . Simmons felt that Pool of Radiance looked primitive and seemed less polished when compared with Champions of Krynn ; he felt that although Pool was not up to the standard of Champions , he said it was still " a fine little game " . Johns , on the other hand , felt that Pool of Radiance was well worth the wait , considering it very user @-@ friendly despite being less polished than Champions of Krynn . 
 Pool of Radiance was well received by the gaming press and won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988 . For the second annual " Beastie Awards " in 1989 , Dragon 's readers voted Pool of Radiance the most popular fantasy role @-@ playing game of the year , with Ultima V as the runner @-@ up . The Apple II version was the most popular format , the PC DOS / MS @-@ DOS came in a close second , and the Commodore 64 / 128 got the fewest votes . The primary factor given for votes was the game 's faithfulness to the AD & D system as well as the game 's graphics and easy @-@ to @-@ use user interface to activate commands . Pool of Radiance was also selected for the RPGA @-@ sponsored Gamers ' Choice Awards for the Best Computer Game of 1989 . In 1990 the game received the fifth @-@ highest number of votes in a survey of Computer Gaming World readers ' " All @-@ Time Favorites " . 
 Allen Rausch , writing for GameSpy 's 2004 retrospective " A History of D & D Video Games " , concluded that although the game " certainly had its flaws ( horrendous load times , interface weirdness , and a low @-@ level cap among others ) , it was a huge , expansive adventure that laid a good foundation for every Gold Box game that followed " . Stan <unk> of <unk> gave a highly positive , though somewhat reserved , review of the NES port of Pool of Radiance , scoring it at 8 / 10 . He commented , " ... it 's great to see a game like this on the NES because there really wasn 't anything of this caliber at the time , RPG or otherwise . Adults were rarely given anything since nearly every title was aimed at younger audiences , so this is one of the few cases where programmers were trying to appeal to an older audience ... if you 're a fan of a true RPG , this is the game for you , you 'll be thoroughly impressed and absorbed .

 Elimination Chamber ( 2010 ) ( also known as No Way Out ( 2010 ) in Germany ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , which took place on February 21 , 2010 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis , Missouri . It was the first event in the Elimination Chamber series . Six matches were aired on the broadcast and one dark match occurred prior to the live broadcast . 
 The concept of the event was that the two main event matches , one each for the World Heavyweight Championship and the WWE Championship , would occur in an Elimination Chamber . Each match featured six competitors : the defending champion and five challengers . Sheamus defended the WWE Championship against Triple H , Ted DiBiase , Randy Orton , John Cena , and Kofi Kingston in the Raw Elimination Chamber . In the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match , The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Jericho , John Morrison , Rey Mysterio , CM Punk and R @-@ Truth . On the undercard , Drew McIntyre defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Kane , The Miz defended the WWE United States Championship against Montel Vontavious Porter , and Maryse and Gail Kim competed against LayCool ( Layla and Michelle McCool ) in an interbrand Divas tag team match . 
 The event received 285 @,@ 000 pay @-@ per @-@ view buys , an increase on the figure earned by the 2009 No Way Out pay @-@ per @-@ view . Despite the increased number of buys , the event received generally negative reviews , with reviewers criticising the undercard of the show as being " weak " and consisting of " filler " material .

 In late 2009 , World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) held a poll on their official website to allow fans to choose a name for their February pay @-@ per @-@ view . The choices included Elimination Chamber , Heavy Metal , Battle Chamber , Chamber of Conflict and No Way Out , which had been the name of the preceding Elimination Chamber @-@ based event . The name Elimination Chamber won , but the event was still promoted as No Way Out in Germany . 
 The concept of the show was that each main event match was to be contested as an Elimination Chamber match . The Elimination Chamber is a circular steel cage , consisting of chains and girders , that surrounds the ring . Four ' pods ' are enclosed within the chamber , one behind each ring post , which are on a steel platform surrounding the outside of the ring . Six wrestlers compete in the match ; four are enclosed within the pods and released at random at specific time intervals , and two start the match . Wrestlers can only be eliminated via pinfall or submission , and the last wrestler left is the winner . For the Elimination Chamber pay @-@ per @-@ view , both WWE world championships , the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship , were to be defended in separate Elimination Chamber matches .

 Just prior to the commencement of the World Heavyweight Championship Elimination Chamber match , The Undertaker was involved in a pyrotechnics accident during his ring entrance . He was temporarily engulfed in flames on three occasions when the pyrotechnics were mistimed , and his jacket briefly caught on fire . He suffered first- and second @-@ degree burns to his neck and chest , and according to a WWE spokesperson the injury " looked like a bad sunburn " . He was only allowed to participate in the match after being cleared by a ringside doctor and was given bottles of water throughout the match to douse himself with to alleviate the discomfort . Chris Jericho , who also competed in the match , has told on multiple occasions how the <unk> responsible was relieved of his employment with WWE and escorted from the arena at the behest of The Undertaker .

 The professional wrestling matches at Elimination Chamber featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre @-@ determined by the hosting promotion , World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE 's weekly television shows Raw and SmackDown with the Raw and SmackDown brands — storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs . 
 The main event matches for the Elimination Chamber event consisted of two Elimination Chamber matches , with Raw 's WWE Championship defended in one and SmackDown 's World Heavyweight Championship defended in the other .

When he climbed to the top rope , however , Porter knocked him off to regain the advantage . The Big Show pulled The Miz out of the ring to safety , and then threw Henry into the security barricade at ringside . With the referee distracted by this , The Big Show used his " Knockout Punch " on Porter , and The Miz was able to pin him to retain his championship . 
 The main event of the pay @-@ per @-@ view was the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship , featuring the defending champion The Undertaker , CM Punk , Rey Mysterio , Chris Jericho , John Morrison , and R @-@ Truth . Mysterio , Morrison , and Jericho entered first and were locked into pods . The Undertaker was the fourth to make his way down to the ring , but an accident occurred during his entrance when his pyrotechnics were mistimed , resulting in him being momentarily engulfed in flames . He was cleared by a ringside doctor to wrestle , however , and was able to compete in the match . The final two , who were to start the match , were CM Punk , who was accompanied by his stable , the Straight Edge Society of Serena and Luke Gallows , and R @-@ Truth . Punk cut a promo on his way to the ring , but was interrupted by R @-@ Truth 's entrance .

Morrison utilised his " Starship Pain " finisher ( a split @-@ legged corkscrew moonsault ) to pin Mysterio and eliminate him from the match . The final entrant into the match was the defending champion The Undertaker , who was able to eliminate Morrison following a chokeslam after approximately 28 minutes . Shawn Michaels , who had requested and been denied a match with The Undertaker for WrestleMania , snuck into the chamber , and performed his " Sweet Chin Music " superkick on The Undertaker .

 Mario Bros. ( <unk> , Mario Burazāzu ) is a platform game published and developed for arcades by Nintendo in 1983 . It was created by Shigeru Miyamoto . It has been featured as a minigame in the Super Mario Advance series and numerous other games . Mario Bros. has been re @-@ released for the Wii 's , Nintendo 3DS 's , and Wii U 's Virtual Console services in Japan , North America , Europe and Australia . 
 In the game , Mario is portrayed as an Italian @-@ American plumber who , along with his younger brother Luigi , has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City . The gameplay focuses on Mario 's extermination of them by flipping them on their backs and kicking them away . The original versions of Mario Bros. — the arcade version and the Family Computer / Nintendo Entertainment System ( FC / NES ) version — were received positively by critics . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Mario Bros. features two plumbers , Mario and Luigi , having to investigate the sewers of New York after strange creatures have been appearing down there . The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase . The mechanics of Mario Bros. involve only running and jumping . Unlike future Mario games , players cannot jump on enemies and squash them , unless they were already turned on their back . Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each corner of the screen , along with an object called a " POW " block in the center . Phases use wraparound , meaning that enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on the opposite side . 
 The player gains points by defeating multiple enemies consecutively and can participate in a bonus round to gain more points . Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back . This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them . If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this , the enemy will flip itself back over , changing in color and increasing speed . Each phase has a certain number of enemies , with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing its speed . 
 There are four enemies : the <unk> , which simply walks around ; the <unk> , which requires two hits to flip over ; the Fighter Fly , which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform ; and the <unk> , which turns platforms into slippery ice . When bumped from below , the <unk> dies immediately instead of flipping over . 
 The " POW " block flips all enemies touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below . It can be used three times before it disappears . In the Super Mario Bros. 3 in @-@ game Player @-@ Versus @-@ Player version of this minigame , each of the three uses causes the opponent to lose a card and all the enemies to be flipped over . Another feature in this small remake is that the pipes are straight , occasionally spitting out large fireballs at the two plumbers . Coins appear whenever enemies are defeated and may be collected for bonus points . 
 As the game progresses , elements are added to increase the difficulty . Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from one side to the other , and icicles form under the platforms and fall loose . Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points and lives by collecting coins without having to deal with enemies ; the " POW " block regenerates itself on each of these screens . 
 = = Development = = 
 Mario Bros. was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi , two of the lead developers for the video game Donkey Kong . In Donkey Kong , Mario dies if he falls too far . Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto that he should be able to fall from any height , which Miyamoto was not sure of , thinking that it would make it " not much of a game . " He eventually agreed , thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities . He designed a prototype that had Mario " jumping and bouncing around " , which he was satisfied with . The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it , observing that it would work since there were multiple floors . However , it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way , which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they 've been flipped to defeat them . This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy , which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below . Because of Mario 's appearance in Donkey Kong with overalls , a hat , and a thick moustache , Shigeru Miyamoto thought that he should be a plumber as opposed to a carpenter , and designed this game to reflect that . Another contributing factor was the game 's setting : it was a large network of giant pipes , so they felt a change in occupation was necessary for him . 
 A popular story of how Mario went from Jumpman to Mario is that an Italian @-@ American landlord , Mario <unk> , had barged in on Nintendo of America 's staff to demand rent , and they decided to name Jumpman after him . Miyamoto also felt that the best setting for this game was New York because of its " labyrinthine subterranean network of sewage pipes . " The pipes were inspired by several manga , which Miyamoto states feature waste grounds with pipes lying around . In this game , they were used in a way to allow the enemies to enter and exit the stage through them to avoid getting enemies piled up on the bottom of the stage . The green coloring of the pipes , which Nintendo late president Satoru Iwata called an uncommon color , came from Miyamoto having a limited color palette and wanting to keep things colorful . He added that green was the best because it worked well when two shades of it were combined . 
 Mario Bros. is one of the first platform games ever created , along with Donkey Kong . It also introduced Mario 's brother , Luigi , who was created for the multiplayer mode by doing a palette swap of Mario . The two @-@ player mode and several aspects of gameplay were inspired by an earlier video game called Joust . To date , Mario Bros. has been released for more than a dozen platforms . The first movement from Mozart 's Eine kleine Nachtmusik is used at the start of the game . This song has been used in later video games , including Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix and Super Smash Bros. Brawl .

 Despite its innovations , Mario Bros. was not a major success in North America due to the video game crash in 1983 . It did however receive a number of home versions on the Apple II , Atari 2600 , Atari 5200 , Atari 8 @-@ bit computers , Atari 7800 , Amstrad CPC , and ZX Spectrum . The Commodore 64 had two versions : an Atarisoft port which was not commercially released and a 1986 version by Ocean Software . The Atari 8 @-@ bit computer version by Sculptured Software , as well as the Apple II port programmed by Jimmy Huey of Designer Software , were the only home versions of the game to feature the falling icicles ( the NES version omitted them due to space constraints on early NES cartridges ) . The latter conversion was not sold either . The game was also rereleased on the Virtual Console service in North America , Australia , Europe and Japan for the Wii , Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. It was also remade on copies of games in the Game Boy Advance 's Super Mario Advance series as well as Mario & Luigi : Superstar Saga , and it was included as a mini @-@ game in Super Mario Bros. 3 . The Game Boy Advance version was included in the 10 free games given out by Nintendo in the 3DS ambassador program due to its inclusion on the cart for the GBA port of Yoshi 's Island which was one of the games on the list . Mario Bros. is also potentially slated for a second release , this time a 3D Classics remake , on the Nintendo 3DS , and may feature camera support , 3D support , or analog support . This release was featured among other games from the NES and SNES to be released for the 3DS on a tech demo called Classic Games at E3 2010 . 
 The NES version was included as a piece of furniture in Animal Crossing for the GameCube , along with many other NES games , though this one required the use of a Nintendo e @-@ Reader , a Game Boy Advance accessory , and a North America @-@ exclusive Animal Crossing e @-@ Card . This version was later re @-@ released in the second series of NES e @-@ Cards , and was even re @-@ released through the Famicom Mini series in Japan . An improved port called <unk> Kita Mario Bros. ( <unk> ) was released in Japan for the Family Computer Disk System , with added features and revisions to gameplay . It also featured cutscenes and even advertisements , being sponsored by the food company <unk> . <unk> Kita is very rare since it was only available as a Disk Writer promotion . A later NES port was released exclusively in Europe in 1993 , called Mario Bros. Classic ; this version had a more refined control and stage intermissions closer to the original arcade version . 
 In 1984 , Hudson Soft made two different games based on Mario Bros. The first was Mario Bros. Special ( <unk> , Mario Burazāzu <unk> ) , which was a re @-@ imagining of the original Mario Bros. with new phases , mechanics and gameplay . The second was Punch Ball Mario Bros. ( <unk> , Panchi Bōru Mario Burazāzu ) , which featured a new gameplay mechanic involving punching small balls to stun enemies . Both games were released for the PC @-@ 8801 , FM @-@ 7 , and X1 and have been described as average for the most part , neither the best or worst games in the series . Mario Clash , a game released in 1995 for the Virtual Boy , was developed as a straight remake of Mario Bros. , with the working title Mario Bros. VB . It was the first stereoscopic 3D Mario game . The objective of the game is to knock all the enemies in a particular phase off ledges . Instead of hitting them from below , like in Mario Bros. , the player must hit enemies using Koopa shells . 
 The Wii U game Super Mario 3D World contains Luigi Bros , a version of Mario Bros. starring Luigi . This game will be unlocked if the Wii U console contains save data from New Super Luigi U or the player completes World 8 .

 Mario Bros. was only modestly successful in Japanese arcades . The arcade cabinets have since become mildly rare . To date in Japan , the NES version of Mario Bros. has sold more than 1 @.@ 63 million copies , and the Famicom Mini re @-@ release of the NES version has sold more than 90 @,@ 000 copies . Despite being released during the North American video game crash of 1983 , the arcade game , as well as the industry , were not affected . Video game author Dave Ellis considers it one of the more memorable classic games . 
 Opinions on the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) version of Mario Bros. have been mostly mixed , but does receive positive reviews from gamers . However , in a review of the Virtual Console game , GameSpot criticized the NES version for being a poor port of the arcade version . The Virtual Console version in particular was heavily criticized . GameSpot criticized it , saying that not only is it a port of an inferior version , but it retains all of the technical flaws found in this version . It also criticizes the Mario Bros. ports in general , saying that this is just one of many ports that have been made of it throughout Nintendo 's <unk> complimented the Virtual Console version 's gameplay , even though it was critical of Nintendo 's decision to release an " inferior " NES port on the Virtual Console . IGN also agreed on the issue of the number of ports . They said that since most people have Mario Bros. on one of the Super Mario Advance games , this version is not worth 500 Wii Points . The Nintendo e @-@ Reader version of Mario Bros. was slightly more well received by IGN , who praised the gameplay , but criticized it for lack of multiplayer and for not being worth the purchase because of the Super Mario Advance versions . 
 The Super Mario Advance releases and Mario & Luigi : Superstar Saga all featured the same version of Mario Bros. ( titled Mario Bros. Classic ) . The mode was first included in Super Mario Advance , and was praised for its simplicity and entertainment value . IGN called this mode fun in its review of Super Mario World : Super Mario Advance 2 , but complained that it would have been nice if the developers had come up with a new game to replace it . Their review of Yoshi 's Island : Super Mario Advance 3 criticizes it more so than in the review of Super Mario Advance 2 because Nintendo chose not to add multiplayer to any of the mini @-@ games found in that game , sticking instead with an identical version of the Mario Bros. game found in previous versions . GameSpot 's review of Super Mario Advance 4 : Super Mario Bros. 3 calls it a throwaway feature that could have simply been gutted . Other reviewers were not as negative on the feature 's use in later Super Mario Advance games . Despite its use being criticized in most Super Mario Advance games , a GameSpy review called the version found in Super Mario Advance 2 a blast to play in multi @-@ player because it only requires at least two Game Boy Advances , one copy of the game , and a link cable .

The Butler Eagle wrote an editorial criticizing the appointment due to her position on the Planned Parenthood of Pennsylvania board , in light of a national controversy over undercover videos about the group 's alleged sale of aborted fetal body parts . Isenhour came into the Chief of Staff position more than three weeks into a budget impasse between Wolf and the Republican @-@ controlled General Assembly . 
 In October 2015 , four months into the state budget impasse , Isenhour issued a memo notifying Wolf 's administration of a hiring freeze and travel ban . On February 3 , 2016 , Isenhour notified the state Public Employee Retirement Commission that , under Wolf 's orders , all employment of its staff would be discontinued . State Representatives Stephen Bloom of Cumberland County and Seth Grove of York County have filed a lawsuit against Wolf challenging that action , arguing the governor lacks the power to dissolve the commission and acted contrary to the Pennsylvania Constitution .

 = Isle of Portland = 
 The Isle of Portland is a limestone tied island , 6 kilometres ( 4 mi ) long by 2 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) wide , in the English Channel . Portland is 8 kilometres ( 5 mi ) south of the resort of Weymouth , forming the southernmost point of the county of Dorset , England . A barrier beach over which runs the A354 road connects it to Chesil Beach and the mainland . Portland and Weymouth together form the borough of Weymouth and Portland . The population of Portland is 12 @,@ 400 . 
 Portland is a central part of the Jurassic Coast , a World Heritage Site on the Dorset and east Devon coast , important for its geology and landforms . Its name is used for one of the British Sea Areas , and has been exported as the name of North American and Australian towns . Portland stone , famous for its use in British and world architecture , including St Paul 's Cathedral and the United Nations Headquarters , continues to be quarried . 
 Portland Harbour , in between Portland and Weymouth , is one of the largest man @-@ made harbours in the world . The harbour was made by the building of stone breakwaters between 1848 and 1905 . From its inception it was a Royal Navy base , and played prominent roles during the First and Second World Wars ; ships of the Royal Navy and NATO countries worked up and exercised in its waters until 1995 . The harbour is now a civilian port and popular recreation area , and was used for the 2012 Olympic Games . 
 = = History = = 
 Portland has been inhabited since at least the Mesolithic period ( the Middle Stone Age ) — there is archaeological evidence of Mesolithic inhabitants at the Culverwell Mesolithic Site , near Portland Bill , and of habitation since then . The Romans occupied Portland , reputedly calling it <unk> . The Vikings first raid on England occurred in Portland in 787 AD , as recorded in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . Three lost Viking ships landed at Portland Bill . The King 's reeve tried to collect taxes from them . They killed him and sailed on . They were Northmen from Hordaland ( the district around Hardanger fjord in west Norway ) . In 1539 King Henry VIII ordered the construction of Portland Castle for defence against attacks by the French ; the castle cost £ 4 @,@ 964 . It is one of the best preserved castles from this period , and is opened to the public by the custodians English Heritage . 
 In the 17th century , chief architect and Surveyor @-@ General to James I , Inigo Jones , surveyed the area and introduced the local Portland stone to London ; using it in his Banqueting House , Whitehall , and for repairs on St Paul 's Cathedral . His successor , Sir Christopher Wren , the architect and Member of Parliament for nearby Weymouth , used six million tons of white Portland limestone to rebuild destroyed parts of the capital after the Great Fire of London of 1666 . Well @-@ known buildings in the capital , including St Paul 's Cathedral and the eastern front of Buckingham Palace feature the stone . After the First World War , a quarry was opened by The Crown Estate to provide stone for the Cenotaph in Whitehall and half a million gravestones for war cemeteries , and after the Second World War hundreds of thousands of gravestones were hewn for soldiers who had fallen on the Western Front . Portland cement has nothing to do with Portland ; it was so named due to its similar colour to Portland stone when mixed with lime and sand . 
 There have been railways in Portland since the early 19th century . The Merchant 's Railway was the earliest — it opened in 1826 ( one year after the Stockton and Darlington railway ) and ran from the quarries at the north of Tophill to a pier at Castletown , from where the Portland stone was shipped around the country . The Weymouth and Portland Railway was laid in 1865 , and ran from a station in Melcombe Regis , across the Fleet and along the low isthmus behind Chesil Beach to a station at Victoria Square in Chiswell . At the end of the 19th century the line was extended to the top of the island as the Easton and Church <unk> Railway , running through Castletown and ascending the cliffs at East Weares , to loop back north to a station in Easton . The line closed to passengers in 1952 , and the final goods train ( and two passenger ' specials ' ) ran in April 1965 . 
 The Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck stationed a lifeboat at Portland in 1826 , which was withdrawn in 1851 . Coastal flooding has affected Portland 's residents and transport for centuries — the only way off the island by land is along the causeway in the lee of Chesil Beach . At times of extreme floods ( about every 10 years ) this road link is cut by floods . The low @-@ lying village of Chiswell used to flood on average every 5 years . Chesil Beach occasionally faces severe storms and massive waves , which have a fetch across the Atlantic Ocean . Following two severe flood events in the 1970s , Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Wessex Water decided to investigate the structure of the beach , and coastal management schemes that could be built to protect Chiswell and the beach road . In the 1980s it was agreed that a scheme to protect against a one @-@ in @-@ five @-@ year storm would be practicable ; it would reduce flood depth and duration in more severe storms . Hard engineering techniques were employed in the scheme , including a gabion running 550 metres ( 600 yd ) to the north of Chiswell , an extended sea wall in Chesil Cove , and a culvert running from inside the beach , underneath the beach road and into Portland Harbour , to divert flood water away from low @-@ lying areas . 
 At the start of the First World War , HMS Hood was sunk in the passage between the southern breakwaters to protect the harbour from torpedo and submarine attack . Portland Harbour was formed ( 1848 – 1905 ) by the construction of breakwaters , but before that the natural anchorage had hosted ships of the Royal Navy for more than 500 years . It was a centre for Admiralty research into <unk> submarine detection and underwater weapons from 1917 to 1998 ; the shore base HMS <unk> was renamed HMS Osprey in 1927 . During the Second World War Portland was the target of heavy bombing , although most warships had moved north as Portland was within enemy striking range across the Channel . Portland was a major embarkation point for Allied forces on D @-@ Day in 1944 . Early helicopters were stationed at Portland in 1946 – 1948 , and in 1959 a shallow tidal flat , The Mere , was infilled , and sports fields taken to form a heliport . The station was formally commissioned as HMS Osprey , which then became the largest and busiest military helicopter station in Europe . The base was gradually improved with additional landing areas and one of England 's shortest runways , at 229 metres ( 751 ft ) . There are still two prisons on Portland : HMP The Verne , which until 1949 was a huge Victorian military fortress , and a Young Offenders ' Institution ( <unk> ) on the Grove clifftop . This was the original prison built for convicts who quarried stone for the Portland <unk> from 1848 . For a few years until 2005 Britain 's only prison ship , HMP The Weare , was berthed in the harbour . 
 The naval base closed after the end of the Cold War in 1995 , and the Royal Naval Air Station closed in 1999 , although the runway remains in use for Her Majesty 's Coastguard Search and Rescue flights as MRCC Portland . MRCC Portland 's area of responsibility extends midway across the English Channel , and from Start Point in Devon to the Dorset / Hampshire border , covering an area of around 10 @,@ 400 square kilometres ( 4 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . The 12 Search and Rescue teams in the Portland area dealt with almost 1000 incidents in 2005 . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Portland is an ancient Royal Manor , and until the 19th century remained a separate liberty within Dorset for administration purposes . It was an urban district from 1894 to 1974 , until the borough of Weymouth and Portland formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 . This merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis with Portland urban district . For local elections the borough is divided into 15 wards , and three of them cover Portland . Elections take place in a four @-@ year cycle ; one third of the councillors in all but three wards retire or seek re @-@ election in years one , two and three , and county council elections are held in year four . 
 The Mayor of Weymouth and Portland is Ray Banham ( Liberal Democrat ) , Kate <unk> ( Labour Party ) is Deputy Mayor . Weymouth , Portland and the Purbeck district are in the South Dorset parliamentary constituency , created in 1885 . The constituency elects one Member of Parliament ; the current MP is Richard Drax ( Conservative ) . South Dorset , the rest of the South West England , and Gibraltar are in the South West England constituency of the European Parliament . 
 Weymouth and Portland have been twinned with the town of <unk> in North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Germany since 1986 , and the French town of Louviers , in the department of Eure in Normandy , since 1959 . The borough and nearby Chickerell have been a Fairtrade Zone since 2007 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Isle of Portland lies in the English Channel , 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) south of Wyke Regis , and 200 km ( 120 mi ) west @-@ southwest of London , at 50 ° 33 ′ 0 ″ N 2 ° 26 ′ 24 ″ W ( 50 @.@ 55 , − 2 @.@ 44 ) . Portland is situated approximately halfway along the UNESCO Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site ; the site includes 153 kilometres ( 95 mi ) of the Dorset and east Devon coast that is important for its geology and landforms . The South West Coast Path runs around the coast ; it is the United Kingdom 's longest national trail at 1 @,@ 014 kilometres ( 630 mi ) . Portland is unusual as it is connected to the mainland at Abbotsbury by Chesil Beach , a tombolo which runs 29 kilometres ( 18 mi ) north @-@ west to West Bay . Portland is sometimes defined incorrectly as a tombolo — in fact Portland is a tied island , and Chesil Beach is the tombolo ( a spit joined to land at both ends ) . 
 There are eight settlements on Portland , the largest being Fortuneswell in Underhill and Easton on Tophill . Castletown and Chiswell are the other villages in Underhill , and Weston , Southwell , Wakeham and the Grove are on the Tophill plateau . Many old buildings are built out of Portland Stone ; Several parts have been designated Conservation Areas to preserve the unique character the older settlements which date back hundreds of years . The architecture ; the natural and man @-@ made environment and the proximity to the sea give Portland overall character which is quite distinct . 
 The Isle of Portland has been designated by Natural England as National Character Area 137 . It is adjoined by the Weymouth Lowlands to the north . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Geologically , Portland is separated into two areas ; the steeply sloping land at its north end called Underhill , and the larger , gently sloping land to the south , called Tophill . Portland stone lies under Tophill ; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1 @.@ 5 degrees , from a height of 151 metres ( 495 ft ) near the Verne in the north , to just above sea level at Portland Bill . The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill ; Underhill lies on a steep escarpment composed of Portland Sand , lying above a thicker layer of Kimmeridge Clay , which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour . This Kimmeridge Clay has resulted in a series of landslides , forming West Weares and East Weares . 
 2 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 5 mi ) underneath south Dorset lies a layer of Triassic rock salt , and Portland is one of four locations in the United Kingdom where the salt is thick enough to create stable cavities . Portland Gas applied to excavate 14 caverns to store 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 3 @.@ 5 × 1010 cu ft ) of natural gas , which is one percent of the UK 's total annual demand . It was proposed that the caverns should be connected to the National gas grid at <unk> via a 37 @-@ kilometre ( 23 mi ) pipeline . Plans had it that the surface facilities should be complete to store the first gas in 2011 , and the entire cavern space available for storage in winter 2013 . As part of the £ 350 million scheme , the Grade II listed former Old Engine Shed would be converted into a £ 1 @.@ 5 million educational centre with a café and an exhibition space about the geology of Portland . However , as of 2014 , these plans are on hold . 
 = = = Portland Bill = = = 
 Portland Bill is the southern tip of the island of Portland . The Bill has three lighthouse towers : The Higher Lighthouse is now a dwelling and holiday apartments ; the Lower Lighthouse is now a bird observatory and field centre which opened in 1961 . The white and red lighthouse on Bill Point replaced the Higher and Lower Lighthouses in 1906 . It is a prominent and much photographed feature ; an important landmark for ships passing the headland and its tidal race . The current lighthouse was refurbished in 1996 and became remotely controlled . It now contains a visitors ' centre giving information and guided tours of the lighthouse . As of June 2009 , the lighthouse uses a 1 kW metal @-@ halide US @-@ made lamp with an operational life of about 4000 hours , or 14 months . Two earlier lighthouses stand further inland : one is an important observatory used by ornithologists , providing records of bird migration and accommodation for visitors . 
 Portland Ledge ( the Shambles ) is an underwater extension of Portland Stone into the English Channel at a place where the depth of Channel is 20 to 40 metres ( about 10 to 20 fathoms ) . Tidal flow is disrupted by the feature ; at 10 metres ( about 5 fathoms ) deep and 2 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 3 nmi ) long , it causes a tidal race to the south of Portland Bill , the so @-@ called Portland Race . The current only stops for brief periods during the 12 ½ hour tidal cycle and can reach 4 metres per second ( 8 kn ) at the spring tide of 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) . 
 = = = Ecology = = = 
 Due to its isolated coastal location , the Isle of Portland has an extensive range of flora and fauna ; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest . Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons , sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists from around the country . Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins , seals and basking sharks . Chesil Beach is one of only two sites in Britain where the Scaly Cricket can be found ; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop . Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007 . 
 The comparatively warm and sunny climate allows species of plants to thrive which do not on the mainland . The limestone soil has low nutrient levels ; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able to grow in the absence of larger species . Portland Sea Lavender can be found on the higher sea cliffs — unique to Portland it is one of the United Kingdom 's rarest plants . The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies ; over half of the British Isles ' 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland , including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe . Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom , including the limestone race of the Silver <unk> Blue . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 The mild seas which almost surround the tied island produce a temperate climate ( Köppen climate classification Cfb ) with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures .

 The mild seas that surround Portland act to keep night @-@ time temperatures above freezing , making winter frost rare : on average 9 @.@ 6 days per year — this is far below the United Kingdom 's average annual total of 55 @.@ 6 days of frost . Days with snow lying are equally rare : on average zero to six days per year ; almost all winters have one day or less with snow lying . It may snow or sleet in winter , yet it almost never settles on the ground — coastal areas in South West England such as Portland experience the mildest winters in the UK . Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience . The growing season lasts for more than 310 days per year , and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9b . 
 Weymouth and Portland , and the rest of the south coast , has the sunniest climate in the United Kingdom . Portland averaged 1798 @.@ 9 hours of sunshine annually between 1981 and 2010 , which is 41 % of the maximum possible , and 34 % above the United Kingdom average of 1339 @.@ 7 hours .

 The A354 road is the only land access to Portland , via Ferry Bridge , connecting to Weymouth and to the wider road network at the A35 trunk road in Dorchester . It runs from Easton , splitting into a northbound section through Chiswell and a southbound section through Fortuneswell , then along Chesil Beach and across a bridge to the mainland in Wyke Regis . Formerly a branch line railway , connecting to the South West Main Line near Weymouth railway station , also crossed to the island . The corridor is now a cycle path connecting Fortuneswell with Weymouth and a wider network of traffic @-@ free cycle paths . 
 Local buses are run by FirstGroup , with services to Weymouth . Weymouth is the hub for south Dorset bus routes , with services to Dorchester and local villages . Weymouth is connected to towns and villages along the Jurassic Coast by the Jurassic Coast Bus service , which runs for 142 kilometres ( 88 mi ) from Exeter to Poole , through <unk> , Beer , Seaton , Lyme Regis , Charmouth , Bridport , Abbotsbury , Weymouth , Wool , and Wareham .

 In 2000 , the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy was built in Osprey Quay in Underhill as a centre for sailing in the United Kingdom . Weymouth and Portland 's waters were credited by the Royal Yachting Association as the best in Northern Europe . Weymouth and Portland regularly host local , national and international sailing events in their waters ; these include the J / 24 World Championships in 2005 , trials for the 2004 Athens Olympics , the ISAF World Championship 2006 , the <unk> Fleet Racing Championships , and the RYA Youth National Championships . 
 In 2005 , the WPNSA was selected to host sailing events at the 2012 Olympic Games — mainly because the Academy had recently been built , so no new venue would have to be provided . However , as part of the South West of England Regional Development Agency 's plans to redevelop Osprey Quay , a new 600 @-@ berth marina and an extension with more on @-@ site facilities were built . Construction was scheduled between October 2007 and the end of 2008 , and with its completion and formal opening on 11 June 2009 , the venue became the first of the 2012 Olympic Games to be completed . 
 Weymouth Bay and Portland Harbour are used for other water sports – the reliable wind is favourable for wind and kite @-@ surfing . Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour are used regularly for angling , diving to shipwrecks , snorkelling , canoeing , and swimming . The limestone cliffs and quarries are used for rock climbing ; Portland has areas for bouldering and deep water soloing , however sport climbing with bolt protection is the most common style .

 Rabbits have long been associated with bad luck on Portland ; use of the name is still taboo — the creatures are often referred to as " Underground Mutton " , " Long @-@ <unk> Furry Things " or just " bunnies " . The origin of this superstition is obscure ( there is no record of it before the 1920s ) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers : they would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and blame them for increasing the risk of dangerous , sometimes deadly , landslides . If a rabbit was seen in a quarry , the workers would pack up and go home for the day , until the safety of the area had been assured . Local fishermen too would refuse to go to sea if the word was mentioned . 
 Even today older Portland residents are ' offended ' ( sometimes for the benefit of tourists ) by the mention of rabbits ; this superstition came to national attention in October 2005 when a special batch of advertisement posters were made for the Wallace and Gromit film , The Curse of the Were @-@ Rabbit . In respect for local beliefs the adverts omitted the word ' rabbit ' and replaced the film 's title with the phrase " Something bunny is going on " .

 Thomas Hardy described Portland as " the peninsular carved by Time out of a single stone " , and named it the Isle of Slingers and Isle of the Race in his Wessex novels ; it was the main setting of The Well @-@ Beloved ( 1897 ) , and was featured in The Trumpet @-@ Major ( 1880 ) . The cottage that now houses Portland Museum was the inspiration for the heroine 's house in The Well @-@ Beloved . Portlanders were expert stone @-@ throwers in the defence of their land , and Hardy 's Isle of Slingers is heavily based on Portland ; the Street of Wells representing Fortuneswell and The Beal Portland Bill . Hardy also called Portland the Gibraltar of the North , with reference to its similarities with Gibraltar ; its physical geography , isolation , comparatively mild climate , and Underhill 's winding streets . 
 Hilaire Belloc 's book The Cruise of the " Nona " is about sailing near Portland , and the reflections it occasions . He describes Portland Race as " the master terror of our world " , and says " ... if you were to make a list of all the things which Portland Race has swallowed up , it would rival Orcus " . 
 In Museums Without Walls , Jonathan Meades declares that " Portland is a bulky chunk of geological , social , topographical and demographic weirdness . It is the obverse of a beauty spot . ' Beauty ' in this construction implies the picturesque . Portland is gloriously bereft of this quality . It is awesome . There is nothing pretty about it . " 
 In The Warlord Chronicles ( 1995 – 97 ) , Bernard Cornwell makes Portland the Isle of the Dead , a place of internal exile , where the causeway was guarded to keep the ' dead ' ( people suffering insanity ) from crossing the Fleet and returning to the mainland . No historical evidence exists to support this idea .

 Craig McAllister ( born 28 June 1980 ) is a Scottish semi @-@ professional footballer who plays as a striker for National League South club Sutton United . 
 McAllister started his career with Eastleigh as a youth player . He moved to Basingstoke Town towards the end of 2001 – 02 , making his debut in March 2002 . McAllister spent three seasons there , making 112 appearances , scoring 66 goals before moving up the national league system to Conference National club Stevenage Borough where he made six appearances , having loan spells at Eastleigh in 2004 and Gravesend & Northfleet in 2004 – 05 . He joined Woking in 2005 , spending two full seasons there , and making over 100 appearances . He had a short spell with Grays Athletic , being sent out on loan to Rushden & Diamonds and then another short spell at Oxford United , all during the 2007 – 08 season . After leaving Oxford in 2008 , he took a step up to the Football League for the first time in his career , signing for Exeter City . He went on to score seven goals in his first season , but was loaned out to Barnet and Rotherham United in his second and was eventually released by the club in May 2010 . McAllister then dropped back down to non @-@ League football , joining Crawley Town where he played at Old Trafford ; his team was defeated 1 – 0 by Manchester United in their FA Cup fifth round tie . He rejected a new contract from Crawley at the end of the 2010 – 11 season , subsequently joining Newport County . 
 McAllister won his first major honour in 2011 , helping Crawley Town win the Conference Premier for the first time in their history .

 Born in Glasgow , McAllister started his career in non @-@ League football at Eastleigh in 2001 . He later moved to Basingstoke Town . He made his debut in March 2002 , scoring in a 1 – 1 draw with Hampton & Richmond Borough . He played ten games in the 2001 – 02 season , scoring three goals . He started the 2002 – 03 season with a goal on the opening day , as Basingstoke drew 2 – 2 with Aylesbury United . In November , McAllister scored two hat @-@ tricks in two games , the first of which helped Basingstoke to a 3 – 1 win over Bishops Stortford , and the second helped his side to a 3 – 0 win over Braintree Town . He finished 2002 – 03 with 35 goals from 47 games . McAllister 's success continued into 2003 – 04 , where he scored another 28 goals in 35 appearances . This success earned him a trial with Queens Park Rangers in the Football League Championship , just one level down from the Premier League . 
 After scoring 66 times in 112 games for Basingstoke Town , he moved to the Conference National outfit Stevenage on a <unk> transfer in May 2004 . He made his debut for Stevenage as a substitute , as they beat Crawley Town , 1 – 0 . After struggling to get in the starting line @-@ up for Stevenage , he was sent out on loan to his former club , Eastleigh , where he scored six goals in four games . In December 2004 , he was loaned out for the second time in that season , moving to Gravesend & Northfleet , where he made debut in a 1 – 0 defeat by Hereford United . In the second minute of Gravesend 's 1 – 1 draw with Crawley Town , he scored the first goal of this loan . He scored his second and last goal of this loan just two days later , which helped his team to a 2 – 2 draw with Accrington Stanley , before he returned to his parent club , Stevenage , in January 2005 .

 = <unk> = 
 The raskovnik or razkovniche ( Serbian Cyrillic and Macedonian : <unk> , Bulgarian : <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> ] , Russian : <unk> @-@ <unk> , Polish : <unk> ) is a magical herb in Slavic ( Bosnian , Bulgarian , Croatian , Macedonian , Montenegrin , Serbian , Slovene , Russian ) and Romanian ( <unk> <unk> ) mythology . According to lore , the raskovnik has the magical property to unlock or uncover anything that is locked or closed . However , legends claim it is notoriously difficult to recognize the herb , and reputedly only certain chthonic animals are able to identify it . 
 = = Names = = 
 The herb is known by a multitude of names among the South Slavs , and the names vary significantly by region . While razkovniche and raskovnik are the customary names in Bulgarian and Serbian respectively and the root is also preserved in the Leskovac dialect as <unk> , in some parts of Macedonia it is known as <unk> <unk> ( " hedgehog grass " ) . In the vicinity of Bar ( southeastern Montenegro ) , the term is <unk> @-@ <unk> , a Turkish borrowing meaning " iron breaker " . In Syrmia , the plant is referred to as <unk> <unk> ( a hapax <unk> ) , in Slavonia it is known as <unk> <unk> ( " earth key " ) , and in Slovenia 's Savinja Valley as <unk> <unk> ( " rainbow root " ) . 
 = = Description and properties = = 
 Traditionally , it is considered that few people , if any , could actually recognize the herb . However , in Bulgarian sources the raskovnik is sometimes described as a grass resembling a four @-@ leaf clover . It grows in meadows and may be picked either while green and blooming or in hay , when it is already dry . While it is not necessarily rare , nor does it thrive only in remote locations , it is nevertheless impossible to recognize by the uninitiated . In the words of Serbian linguist and folklorist Vuk Stefanović Karadžić , “ It is some ( may be imaginary ) grass for which it is thought that thanks to it ( when brushed by it ) every lock and every other closure would open by itself . ” 
 According to the legend , the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock , regardless of its size , material or key . It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground : in Bulgarian beliefs , it could split the ground at the place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it . In some regions of Serbia , the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him . The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground to be replaced by a cauldron filled with gold coins . Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the <unk> ability to transmute iron into gold , the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy . In some interpretations , the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 The raskovnik is believed to have been sought after by treasure hunters , sorcerers and herbalists who desired its magic powers for personal benefit . In Serbia , it was believed that there exist certain treasures , such as the Treasure of Tsar Radovan , which could not be unlocked in any other way but employing a raskovnik . 
 As , according to Bulgarian mythology and some other traditions , tortoises were the only beings who knew the appearance of the herb and the location where it grows , such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise . They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away . When it returns , the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs , so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence . Thus , the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise , which does not need it anymore . 
 While the tricking of a tortoise was the most popular method in Bulgarian mythology , in Dalmatia the legend refers to snakes , and among Serbs another version involves the locking of young hedgehogs in a box for their mother to unlock . In Serbia , one would also have to be quick to take the raskovnik , as the hedgehog would swallow it after use . In any case , turtles , snakes and hedgehogs are all animals with chthonic characteristics which were often variously associated with the underworld in South Slavic tradition . 
 Karadžić also mentions another Serbian method to obtain the raskovnik . He recorded a story from the town of Zemun about a merchant who desired to find the herb . The merchant locked an old woman into leg irons and let her wander in a field during the night ; if the irons unlocked by themselves at a certain place , that would be a place where the raskovnik grows . 
 = = <unk> use = = 
 The legendary herb has entered the modern Bulgarian vocabulary as a metaphor for a magic key or a panacea in the wider sense . The phrase “ to find the razkovniche ” ( „ да <unk> <unk> “ „ da <unk> <unk> “ ) means to find the solution to a certain problem , usually a complex or difficult one . <unk> is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant European <unk> ( Marsilea <unk> ) which , in its appearance , has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik . In eastern Serbia , raskovnik also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine , namely <unk> <unk> .

As a member of the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team , whom he led in interceptions , he earned 2009 first team All @-@ Big Ten recognition from the media and second team recognition from the coaches . He had chosen Michigan over his hometown favorite University of Southern California because he believed that he would be able to play immediately there . Warren had played high school football at Long Beach Polytechnic High School in California .

However , USC had a lot of depth at cornerback at the time and Warren ( as well as his father ) had a good relationship with Michigan assistant coach Ron English . When Warren made Michigan his final decision , he was noted as feeling that his heart wanted him to choose USC , which was the school he had grown up rooting for , but his head led him to Michigan where he could play immediately and work under the tutelage of English , who had developed many defensive backs who went on to the National Football League .

 = = = Rumors and announcement = = = 
 In August and September 2011 , SeaWorld Entertainment filed trademarks for " Antarctica " to be used for a theme area , and " Empire of the Penguins " to be used for an amusement ride . This led to rumors that SeaWorld Orlando would replace its " Penguin Encounter " exhibit with a dark ride . A report by the Orlando Sentinel in October 2011 confirmed these plans , citing " government filings and interviews with people familiar with various elements " . At the time , SeaWorld Orlando would not publicly reveal its plans . 
 On November 8 , 2011 SeaWorld Orlando announced a multi @-@ year expansion plan featuring the opening of Turtle Trek in 2012 and " Antarctica : Empire of the Penguin " in 2013 . Although details of the ride were not released , creative director Brian Morrow said that the ride would be the coldest attraction in the world and would follow the journey of a tiny penguin . On April 24 , 2012 , the park revealed further details about the attraction : guests would ride in eight @-@ person vehicles , choosing among two levels of intensity ( " Mild " or " Wild " ) . The surrounding area would also feature a new penguin habitat , restaurant and store . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 To allow construction to begin , SeaWorld Orlando closed Penguin Encounter , Friends of the Wild and the Antarctic Market Restaurant on January 3 , 2012 . The former attractions were demolished during the first half of 2012 , with vertical construction beginning in July . Construction continued into 2013 , with construction walls coming down one week before the attraction 's opening . The cost of the attraction was reported to be in excess of $ 40 million .

 On February 19 , 2013 , SeaWorld Orlando announced that " Antarctica : Empire of the Penguin " would open on May 24 . Unlike many attractions , the ride had no soft opening period ; instead , it was open to a select number of employees and their families , travel media and bloggers before its public opening . 
 On May 24 , 2013 , SeaWorld Orlando opened Antarctica : Empire of the Penguin to the public . The opening drew thousands of guests to the ride , with some waiting more than four hours to board . On May 25 , one of the penguins escaped the open @-@ air enclosure by leaping out of the water and into the public viewing area ; it was returned to the exhibit unharmed . 
 = = Ride experience and exhibit = = 
 Guests enter the queue from the Antarctica @-@ themed area of the park . Large groups of riders are admitted into a pre @-@ show room , where multiple projections of an Antarctic landscape are blended with 3D exhibits . In a narrated video , guests are introduced to a gentoo penguin colony in Antarctica featuring a newborn penguin named Puck . After the pre @-@ show guests follow a path to a junction , where they choose a " mild " or " wild " ride . They are then divided into groups of eight riders before boarding the ride vehicles at one of four stations . Riders are seated in two rows of four , and restrained by lap bars . 
 When the riders have boarded , the vehicle is dispatched . It travels around an indoor Antarctic environment , spinning to view a variety of scenery and projection screens . The story which began in the pre @-@ show continues , with Puck venturing out into the sea . When he is underwater , Puck is chased by a leopard seal before resurfacing on land . The ride 's theme song – " Antarctica : One World , One Family " by Lauren Alaina – is then played as guests watch a live penguin habitat behind glass before the vehicles return to a four @-@ platform unloading station . 
 Guests disembark in an open @-@ air penguin habitat with an air temperature of approximately 30 ° F ( − 1 ° C ) . This exhibit has minimal barriers between guests and inhabitants , and is designed so guests can hear sounds made by the penguins . 
 A total of 245 penguins live in the exhibit ; species include gentoo , king , Adélie and rockhopper penguins . Lighting in the exhibit allows the park to control the seasons for the penguins . A 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) glass window allows guests to see them in their 45 ° F ( 7 ° C ) pool from an underwater viewing area . The entire experience takes about 25 minutes .

The ride is the first of its kind in the world . 
 When Antarctica : Empire of the Penguin was announced in November 2011 , Oceaneering had already developed a working prototype of the ride vehicle . The first concept art for the attraction was released in April 2012 : a circular ride vehicle , seating eight riders in two rows of four . On May 11 , 2012 Oceaneering filed a patent application for the ride 's technology . At the November 2012 IAAPA Attractions Expo , SeaWorld Orlando and Oceaneering International revealed the trackless , motion simulator @-@ based ride vehicle to the public . 
 Each battery @-@ powered vehicle , or AGV , is made up of two platforms . Riders sit on the upper platform , which provides three degrees of freedom . A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement . Unlike previous ride designs , the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider 's perspective . The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment , allowing a vehicle to cross another 's path . Each vehicle features a built @-@ in controller , which wirelessly communicates with a central ride @-@ system controller . Movement commands are issued by the ride @-@ system controller , and executed by the vehicles ' controllers . A specially @-@ designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms .

 SeaWorld Orlando announced Antarctica : Empire of the Penguin as part of the park 's largest expansion thus far .

 Dewayne Bevil of the Orlando Sentinel said that " the hottest attraction in Central Florida theme parks this week is also the coldest . " Bevil interviewed several park guests ; comments included " I thought it [ the ride ] was really cool " and " it 's beautiful " , and some described it as better than the attractions it replaced . Barbara Nefer of Examiner.com said that guests would love Puck , the ride 's central character . She preferred the wild version of the ride , describing it as " actually still very family friendly " and saying that the exhibit was a " huge highlight " of the attraction . Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider agreed that the highlight of the attraction was the penguin exhibit . Niles described the dispatch procedure as crucial to the ride : " if SeaWorld can dispatch a quartet of ride vehicles every minute or so , as designed , fans will find this a fun ride " . In a later article Niles highlighted some guests ' criticisms of the ride , describing it as " lacking an engaging story and not delivering enough on @-@ ride views of the attraction 's stars -- SeaWorld 's penguins " . However , he argues that SeaWorld 's promotions were too photorealistic creating " expectations for an experience that the ride did not deliver , perhaps setting up many of those visitors for disappointment " . 
 Lawrence Goldsmith of the Daily Mirror and Susan and Simon Veness of the Daily Mail , shared the sentiment of other reviewers : the penguins are the stars of the show . Goldsmith said that the ride options ( mild or wild ) allowed everyone , from children to thrill @-@ seekers , to " enjoy the experience equally " . Susan and Simon Veness described the ride section as thrilling , calling it " one of the highlights " of the attraction . Arthur Levine of About.com gave the ride three out of five stars . Levine gave this moderate rating because he felt conflicted : the animations themselves were good , but the overall storyline was sparse ; the ride system was intriguing , yet it was under utilised . He concluded by applauding " SeaWorld for taking the bold initiative to build a major @-@ league attraction " , but stated " the ride feels rushed and too short " . 
 From a commercial perspective , the opening day of the area saw guests waiting in line for more than four hours to experience the flagship attraction ; SeaWorld had estimated queues of approximately half that time . Dennis <unk> of consulting firm International Theme Park Services expected attendance to increase between five and ten percent . <unk> speculated that this rise would be higher than if a single attraction were unveiled ; however , it would be less than the 36 @-@ percent increase for Islands of Adventure after the opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter . 
 In November 2013 , Oceaneering won a Thea Award from the Themed Entertainment Association for outstanding themed entertainment and experience design , for the trackless ride system developed for Antarctica : Empire of the Penguin . 
 = Smithfield , London = 
 Smithfield is a locality in the ward of Farringdon Without situated at the City of London 's northwest in central London , England . The principal street of the area is West Smithfield . 
 A number of valued City institutions are located in the area , such as St Bartholomew 's Hospital , the Charterhouse , and Livery Halls notably those of the Butchers ' and Haberdashers ' Companies , but Smithfield is best known for its ancient meat market , dating from the 10th century , which is now London 's only remaining wholesale market in continuous operation since medieval times . The area also contains London 's oldest surviving church , St Bartholomew @-@ the @-@ Great , founded in 1123 AD . 
 Smithfield has borne witness to many bloody executions of heretics and political rebels over the centuries , including major historical figures such as Scottish patriot Sir William Wallace and Wat Tyler , leader of the Peasants ' Revolt , among many other religious reformers and dissenters . 
 Smithfield Market , a Grade II listed @-@ covered market building , was designed by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones in the second half of the 19th century , and is the dominant architectural feature of the area . Some of its original market premises fell in to disuse in the late 20th century and faced the prospect of demolition . The Corporation of London 's public enquiry in 2012 drew widespread support for an urban regeneration plan intent upon preserving Smithfield 's historical identity . 
 = = Smithfield area = = 
 In the Middle Ages , it was a broad grassy area known as Smooth Field , located beyond London Wall stretching to the eastern bank of the River Fleet . Given its ease of access to grazing and water , Smithfield established itself as London 's livestock market , remaining so for almost 1 @,@ 000 years . Many local toponyms are associated with the livestock trade : while some street names ( such as " Cow Cross Street " and " Cock Lane " ) remain in use , many more ( such as " Chick Lane " , " Duck Lane " , " Cow Lane " , " Pheasant Court " , " Goose Alley " ) have disappeared from the map after the major redevelopment of the area in the Victorian era . 
 = = = Religious history = = = 
 In 1123 , the area near Aldersgate was granted by King Henry I for the foundation of St Bartholomew 's Priory at the request of Prior <unk> in thanks for his being nursed back to good health . The Priory exercised its right to enclose land between Aldersgate ( to the east ) , Long Lane ( to the north ) and modern @-@ day Newgate Street ( to the south ) , erecting its main western gate which opened onto Smithfield , and a postern on Long Lane . The Priory thereafter held the manorial rights to hold weekly fairs , which initially took place in its outer court on the site of present @-@ day Cloth Fair , leading to " Fair Gate " . 
 An additional annual celebration , the Bartholomew Fair , was established in 1133 by the Augustinian friars and this over time became one of London 's pre @-@ eminent summer fairs , opening each year on 24 August . A trading event for cloth and other goods as well as being a pleasure forum , the four @-@ day festival drew crowds from all strata of English society . 
 In 1855 , however , Bartholomew Fair was closed down by the City authorities after degenerating into a magnet for debauchery and public disorder . 
 In 1348 , Walter de Manny rented 13 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 05 km2 ) of land at Spital Croft , north of Long Lane , from the Master and Brethren of St Bartholomew 's Hospital for a graveyard and plague pit for victims of the Black Death . A chapel and hermitage were constructed , renamed New Church Haw ; but in 1371 , this land was granted for the foundation of the Charterhouse , originally a Carthusian monastery . 
 Nearby and to the north of this demesne , the Knights Hospitaller established a Commandery at Clerkenwell dedicated to St John in the mid @-@ 12th century , and in 1194 received a Charter from King Richard I granting the Order formal privileges . Later Augustinian <unk> established the Priory of St Mary , north of the Knights of St John property . 
 By the end of the 14th century , these religious houses were regarded by City traders as interlopers — occupying what had previously been public open space nearby one of the City gates . On numerous occasions vandals damaged the Charterhouse , eventually demolishing its buildings . By 1405 , a stout wall was built to protect the property and maintain the privacy of the Order , particularly its church where men and women alike came to worship . 
 The religious houses were dissolved in the Reformation , and their lands broken up . The Priory Church of St John remains , as does St John 's Gate , traditionally regarded as the boundary between Smithfield and Clerkenwell . John Houghton ( later canonized by Pope Paul VI as St John Houghton ) , Prior of Charterhouse , went to Thomas Cromwell accompanied by two other local priors seeking an oath of supremacy that would be acceptable to their communities . This resulted in their being flung into the Tower of London , and on 4 May 1535 , they were taken to Tyburn and hanged — becoming the first Catholic martyrs of the Reformation . On 29 May , the remaining twenty monks and eighteen lay brothers were forced to swear the oath of allegiance ; the ten who refused were taken to Newgate Prison and left to starve . 
 With the monks expelled , Charterhouse was requisitioned and remained as a private dwelling until its reestablishment by Thomas Sutton in 1611 as a charitable foundation forming the school named Charterhouse and almshouses known as Sutton 's Hospital in Charterhouse on its former site . Some of the property was damaged during The Blitz , but it remains largely intact , whilst the school was relocated to Godalming in 1872 ; part of the site is also now occupied by Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry . Until 1899 Charterhouse was extra @-@ parochial , when it became a civil parish incorporated in the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury . 
 From its inception , the Priory of St Bartholomew treated the sick . After the Reformation it was left with neither income nor monastic occupants , but following a petition by the City Corporation , Henry VIII refounded it in December 1546 , as the " House of the Poore in West Smithfield in the suburbs of the City of London of Henry VIII 's Foundation " . Letters Patent were presented to the City , granting property and income to the new foundation the following month . King Henry VIII 's sergeant @-@ surgeon , Thomas Vicary , was appointed as the hospital 's first superintendent The King Henry VIII Gate which opens onto West Smithfield was completed in 1702 and remains the hospital 's main entrance . 
 The Priory 's principal church , St Bartholomew @-@ the @-@ Great , was reconfigured after the dissolution of the monasteries losing the western third of its nave . Reformed as an Anglican parish church , its parish boundaries were limited to the site of the ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and Long Lane . The parish of St Bartholomew the Great was designated as a Liberty , responsible for the upkeep and security of its fabric and the land within its boundaries . With the advent of street lighting , mains water and sewerage during the Victorian era , maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the Industrial Revolution . Thus , in 1910 , it agreed to be incorporated by the Corporation of London which guaranteed financial support and security . Great St Barts ' present parish boundary includes just 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 048 m ) of Smithfield — possibly delineating a former right of way . 
 After the Reformation , a separate parish likewise dedicated to St Bartholomew was granted in favour of St Bartholomew 's Hospital — named St Bartholomew @-@ the @-@ Less , it remained under the hospital 's patronage , unique in the Church of England , until 1948 when the hospital was nationalized in the National Health Service . The church benefice is nowadays joined again with its ancient partner , the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great . 
 Following the diminished influence of the ancient Priory , predecessor of the two parishes of St Bartholomew , disputes began to arise over rights to tithes and taxes payable by lay residents who claimed allegiance with the nearby and anciently associated parish of St Botolph Aldersgate — an unintended consequence and legacy of King <unk> VIII 's religious reforms . 
 Smithfield and its Market , mostly situated in the parish of St Sepulchre was founded in 1137 , and was endowed by Prior <unk> , who also founded St Barts . The ancient parish of St Sepulchre extended north to <unk> Street , to St Paul 's Cathedral and Ludgate Hill in the south , and along the east bank of the Fleet ( now the route of Farringdon Street ) . St Sepulchre 's Tower contains the twelve " bells of Old Bailey " from the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons . Traditionally , the Great Bell was rung to announce the execution of a prisoner at Newgate .

 As a large open space close to the City , Smithfield was a popular place for public gatherings . In 1374 Edward III held a seven @-@ day tournament at Smithfield , for the amusement of his beloved Alice Perrers . Possibly the most famous medieval tournament at Smithfield was that commanded in 1390 by Richard II . Jean Froissart , in his fourth book of Chronicles , reported that sixty knights would come to London to tilt for two days , " accompanied by sixty noble ladies , richly ornamented and dressed " . The tournament was proclaimed by heralds throughout England , Scotland , Hainault , Germany , Flanders and France , so as to rival the jousts given by Charles of France at Paris a few years earlier , upon the arrival of his consort Isabel of Bavaria . Geoffrey Chaucer supervised preparations for the tournament as a clerk to the King . 
 Along with Tyburn , Smithfield was for centuries the main site for the public execution of heretics and dissidents in London . The Scottish nobleman Sir William Wallace was executed in 1305 at West Smithfield . The market was the meeting place prior to the Peasants ' Revolt and where the Revolt 's leader , Wat Tyler , was slain by Sir William Walworth , Lord Mayor of London on 15 June 1381 . 
 Religious dissenters ( Catholics as well as other Protestant denominations such as Anabaptists ) were sentenced to death in this area during the Crown 's changing course of religious orientation started by King Henry VIII . About fifty Protestants and religious reformers , known as the Marian martyrs , were executed at Smithfield during the reign of Mary I. 
 <unk> Chesterton observed ironically : 
 " It is foolish , generally speaking , for a philosopher to set fire to another philosopher in Smithfield Market because they do not agree in their theory of the universe . That was done very frequently in the last decadence of the Middle Ages , and it failed altogether in its object " . 
 <unk> 1905 
 On 17 November 1558 , several Protestant heretics were saved by a Royal herald 's timely announcement that Queen Mary had died shortly before the wooden faggots were to be lit at the Smithfield Stake . Under English Law Death Warrants were commanded by Sign Manual ( the personal signature of the Monarch ) , invariably upon ministerial recommendation , which if <unk> by the time of a Sovereign 's death required renewed authority which , in this case , Elizabeth I did not give thereby freeing the Protestants . During the 16th century , Smithfield was also used to execute swindlers and coin forgers who were boiled to death in oil . However , by the 18th century the " Tyburn Tree " ( near the present @-@ day Marble Arch ) , became the main place for public executions in London . After 1785 , they were again moved , this time to the gates of Newgate prison — just to the south of Smithfield . 
 The Smithfield area was fortunate to emerge largely unscathed by the Great Fire of London in 1666 , which was abated near the Fortune of War Tavern , at the junction of <unk> Street and Cock Lane , where the statue of the Golden Boy of Pye Corner is located . In the late 17th century , several residents of Smithfield emigrated to America where they founded the Town of Smithfield , Rhode Island .

 Since the late 1990s , Smithfield and neighbouring Farringdon have developed a reputation for being a cultural hub for up @-@ and @-@ coming professionals who enjoy its vast selection of bars , restaurants and night clubs . 
 Nightclubs such as Fabric and <unk> pioneered the area 's reputation for trendy night life , attracting professionals from nearby Holborn , Clerkenwell and the City on weekdays and , at weekends , the clubs and bars in the area , having late licences , draw people into the area from outside London too . 
 Smithfield has also become a popular venue for sporting events . Until 2002 Smithfield hosted the midnight start of the annual Miglia <unk> Car Rally , but with the increased night club activity around Smithfield the <unk> ( a motoring club ) decided to move the event 's start to Finsbury Circus . Since 2007 , Smithfield has been the chosen location of an annual event dedicated to bike racing known as Smithfield Nocturne .

 Meat has been traded at Smithfield Market for more than 800 years , making it one of the oldest markets in London . A livestock market occupied the site as early as the 10th century . In 1174 the site was described by William <unk> as : 
 " a smooth field where every Friday there is a celebrated rendezvous of fine horses to be traded , and in another quarter are placed <unk> of the peasant , swine with their deep flanks , and cows and oxen of immense bulk . " 
 Costs , customs and rules were meticulously laid down . For instance , for an ox , a cow or a dozen sheep one could get 1 penny . The livestock market expanded over the centuries to meet demand from the growing population of the City . In 1710 , the market was surrounded by a wooden fence containing the livestock within the market ; and until its abolition , the Gate House at Cloth Fair ( " Fair Gate " ) employed a chain ( le <unk> ) on market days . Daniel Defoe referred to the livestock market in 1726 as being " without question , the greatest in the world " , and data available appear to corroborate his statement . 
 Between 1740 and 1750 the average yearly sales at Smithfield were reported to be around 74 @,@ 000 cattle and 570 @,@ 000 sheep . By the middle of the 19th century , in the course of a single year 220 @,@ 000 head of cattle and 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 sheep would be " violently forced into an area of five acres , in the very heart of London , through its narrowest and most crowded thoroughfares " . The volume of cattle driven daily to Smithfield started to raise major concerns . 
 The Great North Road traditionally began at Smithfield Market and mileages were measured from here . The specific start was Hicks Hall , and its former location continued to be used for mileages even after it was demolished , soon after 1778 . The road followed St John Street , and continued north , eventually leading to Edinburgh . This ended in 1829 , with the establishment of the General Post Office at St Martin 's @-@ le @-@ Grand , which became the new starting point . 
 = = = Local campaigning against the cattle market = = = 
 In the Victorian period , pamphlets started circulating in favour of the removal of the livestock market and its relocation outside of the City , due to its extremely poor hygienic conditions as well as the brutal treatment of the cattle . The conditions at the market in the first half of the 19th century were often described as a major threat to public health : 
 Of all the horrid abominations with which London has been cursed , there is not one that can come up to that disgusting place , West Smithfield Market , for cruelty , filth , <unk> , pestilence , impiety , horrid language , danger , disgusting and shuddering sights , and every obnoxious item that can be imagined ; and this abomination is suffered to continue year after year , from generation to generation , in the very heart of the most Christian and most polished city in the world . 
 In 1843 , the Farmer 's Magazine published a petition signed by bankers , salesmen , butchers , aldermen and City residents against further expansion of the meat market , arguing that livestock markets had been systematically banned since the Middle Ages in other areas of London : 
 Our ancestors appear , in sanitary matters , to have been wiser than we are . There exists , amongst the Rolls of Parliament of the year 1380 , a petition from the citizens of London , praying - that , for the sake of the public health , meat should not be slaughtered nearer than " <unk> " , under penalty , not only of forfeiting such animals as might be killed in the " <unk> " , but of a year 's imprisonment . The prayer of this petition was granted , audits penalties were enforced during several reigns . 
 Thomas Hood wrote in 1830 an Ode to the Advocates for the Removal of Smithfield Market , applauding those " philanthropic men " who aim at removing to a distance the " vile Zoology " of the market and " routing that great nest of <unk> " . Charles Dickens criticised locating a livestock market in the heart of the capital in his 1851 essay A Monument of French Folly drawing comparisons with the French market at Poissy outside Paris : 
 Of a great Institution like Smithfield , [ the French ] are unable to form the least conception . A Beast Market in the heart of Paris would be regarded an impossible nuisance . Nor have they any notion of slaughter @-@ houses in the midst of a city . One of these benighted frog @-@ eaters would scarcely understand your meaning , if you told him of the existence of such a British bulwark . 
 An Act of Parliament was passed in 1852 , under the provisions of which a new cattle market should be constructed at Copenhagen Fields , Islington . The Metropolitan Cattle Market opened in 1855 , leaving West Smithfield as waste ground for about ten years during the construction of the new market . 
 = = = Victorian Smithfield : meat and poultry market = = = 
 The present Smithfield meat market on Charterhouse Street was established by Act of Parliament : the 1860 Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Market Act . It is a large market with permanent buildings , designed by architect Sir Horace Jones , who also designed Billingsgate and Leadenhall Markets . Work on the Central Market , inspired by Italian architecture , began in 1866 and was completed in November 1868 at a cost of £ 993 @,@ 816 ( £ 81 million as of 2016 ) . 
 The Grade II listed main wings ( known as East and West Market ) are separated by the Grand Avenue , a wide roadway roofed by an elliptical arch with decorations in cast iron . At the two ends of the arcade , four prominent statues represent London , Edinburgh , Liverpool and Dublin depicting bronze dragons charged with the City 's armorial bearings . At the corners of the market four octagonal pavilion towers were built , each with a dome displaying carved stone griffins . 
 As the Market was being built , a cut and cover railway tunnel was constructed underground City street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916 , it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services . The construction of extensive railway sidings , beneath Smithfield Park , facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its Cold Store , and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts . These sidings closed in the 1960s , and are now used as a car park , accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park . Today , much of the meat is delivered to market by road . 
 The first extension of Smithfield 's meat market took place between 1873 and 1876 with the construction of the Poultry Market immediately west of the Central Market . A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field ( now West Smithfield ) , comprising gardens , a fountain and a ramped carriageway to the station beneath the market building . Further buildings were subsequently added to the market . The General Market , built between 1879 and 1883 , was intended to replace the old Farringdon Market located nearby and established for the sale of fruit and vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 1826 – 1830 . 
 A further block ( also known as Annexe Market or Triangular Block ) consisting of two separate structures ( the Fish Market and the Red House ) was built between 1886 and 1899 . The Fish Market , built by John Mowlem & Co . , was completed in 1888 , one year after Sir Horace Jones ' death . The Red House , with its imposing red brick and Portland stone façade , was built between 1898 and 1899 for the London Central Markets Cold Storage Co . Ltd .. It was one of the first cold stores to be built outside the London docks and continued to serve Smithfield Market until the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 During World War II , a large underground cold store at Smithfield was the theatre of secret experiments led by Dr Max Perutz on <unk> , a mixture of ice and <unk> , believed to be possibly tougher than steel . Perutz 's work , inspired by Geoffrey Pyke and part of Project Habakkuk , was meant to test the viability of <unk> as a material to construct floating airstrips in the Atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo planes in support of Admiral the Earl Mountbatten 's operations . The experiments were carried out by Perutz and his colleagues in a refrigerated meat locker in a Smithfield Market butcher 's basement , behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses . These experiments became obsolete with the development of longer range aircraft and the project was then abandoned . 
 At the end of World War II , a V @-@ 2 rocket struck at the north side of Charterhouse Street , near the junction with Farringdon Road ( 1945 ) . The explosion caused massive damage to the market buildings , impacting the railway tunnel structure below , with the loss of over 110 lives . 
 The original Poultry Market designed by Sir Horace Jones was destroyed by fire in 1958 . Its Grade II listed replacement building was designed by Sir Thomas Bennett in 1962 – 63 , with a reinforced concrete frame , and external cladding of dark blue brick . The main hall is covered by an enormous concrete dome , shaped as an elliptical paraboloid , spanning 225 feet ( 69 m ) by 125 feet ( 38 m ) and only 3 inches ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) thick at the centre . The dome is believed to have been the largest concrete shell structure built at that time in Europe .

 Smithfield is London 's only major wholesale market ( Leadenhall Market nowadays attracting more tourist trade ) which has escaped relocation out of central London to cheaper land , better transport links and more modern facilities ( as have Covent Garden , Spitalfields and Billingsgate ) . The purpose of the market remains to supply inner City butchers , shops and restaurants with quality fresh meat , and so its main trading hours are 4 : 00 a.m. to 12 : 00 noon each weekday . Instead of moving away , Smithfield Market continues to modernise its existing site : its imposing Victorian buildings have had access points added for the loading and unloading of lorries . 
 The buildings stand above a warren of tunnels : previously , live animals were brought to market by hoof ( from the mid @-@ 19th century onwards they arrived by rail ) and were slaughtered on site . The former railway tunnels are now used for storage , parking and as basements . An impressive cobbled ramp spirals down around West Smithfield 's public garden , on the south side of the Market , providing access to part of this area . Some of the buildings on Charterhouse Street on Smithfield north side maintain access to the tunnels via their basements . 
 Some of the former meat market buildings have now changed use . For example , the former Central Cold Store , on Charterhouse Street is now , most unusually , a City centre cogeneration power station operated by <unk> . Other former cold storage warehousing ( The Metropolitan Cold Stores ) has been converted into the acclaimed nightclub Fabric . 
 Smithfield comprises the market as its central feature surrounded many old buildings on three sides and a public open space ( or Rotunda Garden ) at West Smithfield , beneath which there is a public car park . The south side is occupied by St Bartholomew 's Hospital ( known as Barts in common parlance ) , and on the east side by the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great . The Church of St Bartholomew the Less is located next to the King Henry VIII Gate , the hospital 's main entrance . The north and south of the square are now closed to through traffic , as part of the City 's security and surveillance cordon known as the Ring of steel . Security for the market is provided by its market constabulary . 
 = = Demolition and development plans = = 
 Since 2005 , the General Market ( 1883 ) and the adjacent Fish Market and Red House buildings ( 1898 ) , part of the Victorian complex of the Smithfield Market , have been facing a threat of demolition . The City of London Corporation , ultimate owners of this property has been engaged in public consultation to assess how best to redevelop their disused property and regenerate the area . Former property developers Thornfield Properties had planned to demolish the historic site and build a seven @-@ storey office block , offering 350 @,@ 000 square feet ( 33 @,@ 000 m2 ) of office space with a retail outlet on the ground floor . 
 Several campaigns , promoted by English Heritage and Save Britain 's Heritage among others , are being run to raise public awareness of this important part of London 's Victorian heritage . Grade II listed building protection was approved for the Red House Cold Store building in 2005 by then @-@ Culture Secretary Dame Tessa Jowell , on the basis of new historical evidence qualifying the complex as " the earliest existing example of a purpose @-@ built powered cold store " . 
 Whilst the Market continues to trade , its future remains unclear following Government Planning Minister Ruth Kelly 's instigating a major public inquiry in 2007 . The Public Inquiry for the demolition and redevelopment of the General Market Building took place between 6 November 2007 and 25 January 2008 . In August 2008 , Communities Secretary Hazel Blears announced that planning permission for the General Market 's redevelopment had been refused , stating that the threatened buildings made " a significant contribution " to the character and appearance of Farringdon and the surrounding area . 
 On 12 October 2012 , Henderson Group unveiled its £ 160 million @-@ plan for redeveloping the western side of the Central Market . Henderson proposed that the fish market , General Market and Red House buildings , all over a century @-@ old , make way for restaurants , retailers and office buildings while restoring and retaining much of the Market building 's original perimeter walls , with a new piazza being created in the General Market . 
 Some of the buildings on Lindsey Street opposite the East Market were demolished in 2010 to allow the construction of the new Crossrail Station at Farringdon . The demolished buildings include Smithfield House ( an early 20th @-@ century unlisted <unk> concrete building ) , the Edmund Martin Ltd. shop ( an earlier building with alterations dating to the 1930s ) and two Victorian warehouses behind them . Redevelopment proposals are ongoing as of 2014 . 
 In the March of 2015 , the Museum of London revealed plans to vacate its Barbican site and move into the General Market Building . The cost of the move is estimated to be in the region of £ 70 million and , if funding can be achieved , would be complete by 2021 .

 = HMS Havelock ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Havelock was an H @-@ class destroyer that had originally been ordered by the Brazilian Navy with the name <unk> in the late 1930s , but was bought by the Royal Navy after the beginning of the Second World War in September 1939 and later renamed . She participated in the Norwegian Campaign in May 1940 and was assigned to convoy escort and anti @-@ submarine patrols with the Western Approaches Command afterwards . The ship was briefly assigned to Force H in 1941 , but her anti @-@ aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she rejoined Western Approaches Command . Havelock became flotilla leader of Escort Group B @-@ 5 of the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force in early 1942 and continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for the next two years . The ship was converted to an escort destroyer and sank one submarine during the war . After the end of the war , she escorted the ships carrying the Norwegian government in exile back to Norway and served as a target ship through mid @-@ 1946 . Havelock was scrapped beginning in late 1946 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Havelock displaced 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 883 long tons ( 1 @,@ 913 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Havelock carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil , giving her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 152 officers and enlisted men . 
 The vessel was designed for four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear , but ' Y ' gun was removed to compensate for the additional depth charges added . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Havelock had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were originally fitted , but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while fitting @-@ out . The ship 's load of depth charges was increased from 20 to 110 as well . 
 Havelock was completed without a director @-@ control tower ( DCT ) so the three remaining 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch low @-@ angle guns fired in local control using ranges provided by a rangefinder . She was fitted with an ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water .

 Havelock was fitted with a HF / DF radio direction finder before completion and she had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun by October 1940 . The ship 's short @-@ range AA armament was later augmented by two Oerlikon 20 mm guns on the wings of the ship 's bridge and the .50 @-@ calibre machine gun mounts were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons . It is uncertain if the ship 's director @-@ control tower was installed before a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge . At some point , the ship was converted to an escort destroyer . ' A ' gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar and additional depth charge stowage replaced the 12 @-@ pounder high @-@ angle gun . A Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar was fitted and the HF / DF installation was moved to a pole mainmast .

 <unk> was ordered by Brazil on 8 December 1937 from J. Samuel White , Cowes . The ship was laid down on 31 May 1938 and was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 after the beginning of the Second World War and renamed HMS Havelock . She was launched on 16 October and commissioned on 10 February 1940 . After working up , the ship was assigned to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla of the Western Approaches Command . Havelock was detached to Home Fleet during the Norwegian Campaign and supported the Allied landings on 12 – 13 May at Bjerkvik during the Battle of Narvik . During the initial stages of this battle , she mounted a French mortar battery on her forecastle . She continued to provide fire support during the battle for the rest of the month . During the nights of 30 and 31 May , the ship helped to evacuate troops from Bodø to Harstad and Borkenes to await further evacuation . Havelock was one of the ships that escorted the troop ships evacuating the troops from the Narvik area on 7 and 8 June . She was commanded by Capt. E. Barry Stevens , DSC . 
 Later in June , the ship rejoined the 9th Destroyer Flotilla and spent most of the next two years escorting convoys . Late in 1940 the Flotilla was redesignated as the 9th Escort Group . Havelock was attached to Force H in Gibraltar to reinforce the escort during Operations Tiger in May 1941 . The ship returned to the Western Approaches command afterwards as her anti @-@ aircraft capability was believed by Admiral James Somerville to be too weak for operations in the Mediterranean . 
 In March 1942 , Havelock became flotilla leader of Escort Group B @-@ 5 team of the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force and continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic until early 1944 . From 28 December to 14 January 1943 , the escort group defended Convoy TM 1 , a group of nine oil tankers sailing from Trinidad to Gibraltar . The convoy was attacked by several U @-@ boat wolfpacks en route and lost seven of its ships despite the best efforts of its escort . Havelock only managed to damage U @-@ 436 with depth charges whilst escorting this convoy . Havelock and her consorts escorted Convoy SC 122 through the largest convoy battle of the war some two months later . In mid @-@ 1943 , the escort group was deployed to the Bay of Biscay to attack U @-@ boats in cooperation with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) as they left their bases on the French Atlantic coast . In late September – early October , the group escorted ships carrying No. 247 Group RAF to the Azores to begin setting up airbases there . 
 In early 1944 , Havelock was transferred to the 14th Escort Group which was given the task of protecting the convoys supporting Operation Overlord , the impending invasion of Western Europe , in British coastal waters , captained by Earl H. Thomas . Together with the destroyers Fame and Inconstant , the ship sank U @-@ 767 on 18 June . She was refitted in Liverpool from July to September and rejoined the group upon completion . Havelock was under repair again in February – April 1945 , but they were completed by 30 April when the ship , together with her sister Hesperus , attacked the wreck of U @-@ 246 northwest of the island of Anglesey thinking that it was U @-@ 242 which had been spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat earlier that day . 
 Two weeks later , Havelock and the 14th Escort Group escorted a group of surrendered German U @-@ boats from Loch Alsh to Lough Foyle . On 27 May , the ship , together with Hesperus , escorted the exiled Norwegian government back to Oslo and remained there until 1 June . Later that month , she began service as an aircraft target , a role that lasted for the next year . The ship was approved for scrapping on 18 February 1946 and was placed in Category C reserve on 2 August . Havelock was sold on 31 October and scrapped at Inverkeithing . 
 = Sunda slow loris = 
 The Sunda slow loris ( Nycticebus coucang ) or greater slow loris is a strepsirrhine primate and a species of slow loris native to Indonesia , western Malaysia , southern Thailand and Singapore . It measures 27 to 38 cm ( 11 to 15 in ) from head to tail and weighs between 599 and 685 g ( 21 @.@ 1 and 24 @.@ 2 oz ) . Like other slow lorises , it has a wet nose ( rhinarium ) , a round head , small ears hidden in thick fur , a flat face , large eyes and a vestigial tail . 
 The Sunda slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal , typically occurring in evergreen forests . It prefers rainforests with continuous dense canopies and has an extremely low metabolic rate compared to other mammals of its size . Its diet consists of sap , floral nectar , fruit and arthropods . It will feed on exudates such as gum and sap by licking wounds in trees . The species is generally solitary ; one study showed only 8 % of its active time was spent near other individuals . Social behavior makes up a very small part of the activity budget , though it has monogamous mating system with the offspring living with the parents . It sleeps during the day , rolled up in a ball in hidden parts of trees above the ground , often on branches , twigs , palm fronds , or lianas . The species is <unk> , usually giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 192 days . The young disperses between 16 and 27 months , generally when it is sexually mature . 
 The species is listed as " Vulnerable " on the IUCN Red List . It is threatened with extinction due to a growing demand in the exotic pet trade , and has become one of the most abundant primate species on sale at Indonesian pet markets . Its teeth are often pulled out before being sold as pets which can result in infection and / or death , this process makes reintroduction to the wild impossible . It also suffers from habitat loss , which has been severe in the areas in which it is found . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The common name , Sunda slow loris , refers to the Sunda Islands , a group of islands in the western part of the Malay archipelago where it is found . Another common name for the species is the Greater Slow Loris . The specific name , coucang , derives from kukang , its common name in Indonesia . It is commonly known as malu @-@ malu , meaning " shy " in Indonesian , and also as <unk> or <unk> . It is sometimes called <unk> , because local people do not distinguish between the slow loris and <unk> , a group of Australasian possums . In Malaysia they are sometimes known as <unk> or kera <unk> ; kera is Malay for monkey while <unk> is the fruit @-@ bearing tree , <unk> <unk> . In Thailand , it is called ling <unk> ( <unk> ) , which translates as " wind monkey " . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The Sunda slow loris was first described ( in part ) in 1785 by the Dutch physician and naturalist Pieter Boddaert under the name Tardigradus coucang . However , its discovery dates to 1770 , when the Dutchman Arnout Vosmaer ( 1720 – 1799 ) described a specimen of it as a type of sloth . Vosmaer gave it the French name " le <unk> <unk> du <unk> " ( " the five @-@ fingered sloth of Bengal " ) , but Boddaert later argued that it was more closely aligned with the lorises of Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) and Bengal . 
 Between 1800 and 1907 , several other slow loris species were described , but in 1953 the primatologist William Charles Osman Hill , in his influential book , Primates : Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy , consolidated all the slow lorises into a single species , N. coucang . In 1971 Colin Groves recognized the pygmy slow loris ( N. pygmaeus ) as a separate species , and divided N. coucang into four subspecies . In 2001 Groves opined that there were three species ( N. coucang , N. pygmaeus , and N. bengalensis ) , and that N. coucang itself had three subspecies ( Nycticebus coucang coucang , N. c. menagensis , and N. c. javanicus ) . These three subspecies were promoted in 2010 to species status — the Sunda slow loris , the Javan slow loris ( N. javanicus ) and Bornean slow loris ( N. menagensis ) . Species differentiation was based largely on differences in morphology , such as size , fur color , and head markings . ( At the end of 2012 , the Bornean slow loris was itself divided into four distinct species . ) : 46 
 When Étienne Geoffroy Saint @-@ Hilaire defined the genus Nycticebus in 1812 , he made the Sunda slow loris the type species . This was questioned in 1921 by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas , who noted that there was some confusion over which specimen was used as the type specimen . Instead , he suggested that the type specimen was actually the Bengal slow loris , Lori bengalensis Lacépède , 1800 . There was further confusion during the 1800s when Boddaert 's Tardigradus coucang was routinely mistaken for Carl Linnaeus ' Lemur tardigradus – a species he had described in the 10th edition of Systema Naturæ ( 1758 ) The fact that Lemur tardigradus was actually a slender loris remained obscured until 1902 , when mammalogists Witmer Stone and James A. G. Rehn finally cleared the air . 
 The species has 50 chromosomes ( 2n = 50 ) , and it genome size is 3 @.@ 58 pg . Of its chromosomes , 22 are metacentric , 26 are submetacentric , and none are acrocentric . Its X chromosome is submetacentric , and its Y chromosome is metacentric . 
 To help clarify species and subspecies boundaries , and to establish whether morphology @-@ based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships , the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D @-@ loop and cytochrome b . Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus ( including the pygmy slow loris ( N. pygmaeus ) , Bornean slow loris ( N. menagensis ) and the Javan slow loris ( N. javanicus ) ) were shown to be genetically distinct , the analysis suggested that DNA sequences from selected individuals of Sunda slow loris ( N. coucang ) and Bengal slow loris ( N. bengalensis ) shared a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with other members of their own respective species . The authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization , as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand ; the precise origin of one of the N. coucang individuals was not known . This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N. bengalensis and N. coucang , and suggested that there has indeed been gene flow between the two species . 
 = = Anatomy and physiology = = 
 The Sunda slow loris has dark rings around its large eyes , a white nose with a whitish strip that extends to the forehead and a dark stripe that stretches from the back of the head along the spine . Its soft , thick , woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown , with a lighter underside . The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head . It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes , more distinct dark coloring around the eyes , and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger , grayer , and shows less contrast . The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris . Local color variations are known to occur . 
 It measures between 27 and 38 centimetres ( 11 and 15 in ) and weighs 599 and 685 grams ( 21 @.@ 1 and 24 @.@ 2 oz ) . Unlike the Bengal slow loris , the Sunda slow loris does not show sexual dimorphism by weight . The vestigial tail , hidden beneath the fur , is reduced to a stump . It has a toothcomb , six forward @-@ facing teeth on the bottom jaw , which includes the lower incisors and the canine teeth . The structure is generally used for grooming in other <unk> primates , but lorises also use it to scrape off gum when foraging . It has a shortened second digit , and the hands have a strong grip . Like other lorises , it excretes a strong @-@ smelling liquid from glands beneath its arms which is used in communication . 
 One major distinguishing feature between all loris species is locomotion : the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees on all four limbs , typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time . Its movement has been described as unique ; similar to crawling , or as if it was climbing in every direction , the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed . In captivity , about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally , a quarter suspended or hanging , a quarter climbing , and a quarter clasping multiple branches ( bridging ) . It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time . 
 = = Behavior and ecology = = 
 Like other slow lorises , the Sunda slow loris is an arboreal and nocturnal primate , resting by day in the forks of trees , or in thick vegetation and feeding on fruit and insects by night . Unlike other loris species , it remains in trees most of its life : while the Bengal slow loris will often sleep on the ground , the Sunda slow loris sleeps in a ball in branches or foliage . It usually sleeps alone but has been observed to sleep with several conspecifics ( individuals of the same species ) , including other adults . Adults live in overlapping ranges of 0 @.@ 004 to 0 @.@ 25 km2 ( 0 @.@ 0015 to 0 @.@ 0965 sq mi ) . 
 Despite its slow metabolism rate , the Sunda slow loris has a high @-@ energy diet . Its slow lifestyle may be due to the energy costs of detoxifying certain secondary plant compounds in many genera of food plants their diets . The largest amount of time is spent eating phloem sap ( 34 @.@ 9 % ) , floral nectar and nectar @-@ producing plant parts ( 31 @.@ 7 % ) , and fruits ( 22 @.@ 5 % ) . It also consumes gums and arthropods such as spiders and insects . Gum is taken by licking wounds on trees . They are also known to feed on molluscs , including the giant land snail Achatina fulica , and birds ' eggs . 
 All slow loris species produce a toxin in glands on the insides of their elbows . This is spread across their bodies and those of their offspring using the toothcomb while grooming . When threatened with predators , the Sunda slow loris can bite , roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva @-@ covered fur , or roll up and drop from the trees . However , the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis , whereby it hides . The Asiatic reticulated python , the changeable hawk @-@ eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris . 
 = = = Social systems = = = 
 The Sunda slow loris may fit into the monogamous single male / single female social system , though are mainly known to be solitary . One study showed only 8 % of the species ' active time was spent near other individuals . Where home ranges overlap , spatial groups are formed . These groups consist of one male , one female and up to three younger individuals . The interactions between these individuals are largely friendly ; they include allogrooming , following , pant @-@ growling , and click @-@ calling , although social behaviors only make up around 3 % of the activity budget . When it comes into contact with conspecifics from other home ranges there is usually no reaction as home ranges are not defended . In captivity however , it can be aggressive with other individuals . Males have shown antagonistic behaviors such as attacks , pursuits , threats , assertion , fighting , and subordination . The fighting often results in serious injury . Despite this , they are known to be generally sociable in captivity , with allogrooming being the most common social behavior . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 There are eight distinct call types made by Sunda slow loris adults , which can be divided into two categories : contact and contact @-@ seeking calls such as whistles and short <unk> ( a social play and attention @-@ seeking call ) , and aggressive and defensive calls such as long <unk> , screams , snarls and grunts . Because they rely on crypsis to avoid predators , they do not make alarm calls . Infants emits clicks and squeaks when disturbed . During estrus , females make whistle calls when in visual contact with a male . When exploring new environments and during handling , it makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of the human hearing range . 
 Olfactory communication is very important in this species . It has roles in alerting others of the identity , physical state and position of the individual . It is also important in reproduction . Like other slow lorises , the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils . The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication , but it is toxic to humans . If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die . It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine . When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found . The Sunda slow loris may grin or bare its teeth . When stressed , infants may grin , while adults bear their teeth to show aggression or fear , but also during play . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Reproduction is one of the few times the Sunda slow loris aggregates with conspecifics , as it is largely solitary . One study recorded that the most slow lorises ever seen together was six ; this appeared to be a female in estrus and five males following her . This may suggest a more promiscuous mating system , where females mate with more than one male . Despite this , its testis size is small compared with similar sized <unk> , which is indicative of monogamy . In the wild the mating system of the Sunda slow loris is thought to vary between populations . 
 Sexual maturity is reached between the ages of 18 and 24 months in females , and can be reached by 17 months in males . It is polyestrous , having many periods of sexual receptivity during a year . In captivity however , there is a clear birth peak between March and May . It has been observed that reproductive patterns of captive prosimians in the northern hemisphere are altered . The estrus cycle lasts 29 – 45 days , with most copulations occurring on the same day . 
 Females in estrus are followed by males , with copulation initiated by the female . The female will hang from a branch and may vocalise . The male will hold the female and the branch and copulate with her . Urine @-@ marking and vocalising are also used by the female to solicit mating . The male may create a mating plug following copulation . 
 The gestation period averages 192 @.@ 2 days , after which one young is born , although twinning has been observed . Both males and females will disperse in the wild , this occurs between 16 and 27 months . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Sunda slow loris is found in continuous canopy tropical rainforests . It is adaptable and will also live in other types of habitat . It is found in Indonesia , on the islands of Sumatra , Batam and Galang in the Riau Archipelago , and Pulau <unk> and Great Natuna ( <unk> ) in the Natuna Islands ; in Malaysia on the Malay Peninsula and Pulau <unk> ; in the southern peninsular of Thailand ; and Singapore . 
 The Sunda slow loris is sympatric ( shares its range ) with the Bengal slow loris in Thailand and hybridisation has occurred . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 According to the 2008 International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List assessment , the Sunda slow loris was evaluated as " Vulnerable " . In June 2007 it was transferred from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I , indicating a true concern about the state of international trade in this species , an act now forbidden by international law . It is also protected by Indonesian law , though the law does not seem to be strictly enforced . Its population size is unknown and further studies need to be carried out to confirm their conservation status . 
 The Sunda slow loris is greatly threatened by the pet trade , and is sold as an exotic pet throughout southeast Asia . The slow lorises are the most commonly traded protected primates in southeast Asia . When sold as a pet it often will have its teeth pulled out to prevent injury to the owner . This may cause dental infections which have up to a 90 % death rate . Once it has lost its teeth , reintroduction to the wild is impossible . Due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress , improper nutrition and infection , the pet trade is inflated by replacements . With a greater purchasing power , the increasing human populations in the species ' range could have an even more serious impact . 
 The Sunda slow loris is further threatened by gathering for illegal traditional medicine . The fur is reported to heal wounds , the flesh to cure epilepsy , eyes are used in love potions , and the meat is reported to cure asthma and stomach problems . It is also killed as a crop pest . Severe habitat loss and degradation over large areas of its range have caused large population declines , even though the species is more adaptable to anthropogenic habitats than other primates in the region . The resulting fragmentation has restricted species dispersal as it depends on continuous canopy cover to move from tree to tree . 
 = Pichilemu = 
 Pichilemu ( Mapudungun : Small forest , pronounced : [ <unk> ] ) , originally known as <unk> , is a beach resort city and commune in central Chile , and capital of Cardenal Caro Province . The commune comprises an urban centre and twenty @-@ two villages , such as Ciruelos , Cáhuil , and Espinillo . It is located southwest of Santiago , the capital of Chile . Pichilemu had over 13 @,@ 000 residents as of 2012 . 
 The Pichilemu area was long populated by the indigenous Promaucaes . European @-@ Chilean development began in the mid @-@ sixteenth century , as conquistador Pedro de Valdivia gave Juan Gómez de Almagro the Topocalma encomienda ( which included the current territory of Pichilemu ) in January 1541 . Pichilemu was established as an " autonomous commune " on 22 December 1891 , by decree of the President Jorge Montt and Interior Minister Manuel José Irarrázabal . Agustín Ross Edwards , a Chilean politician and member of the Ross Edwards family , planned to develop it as a beach resort on the Pacific Ocean for upper @-@ class Chileans . 
 Pichilemu is home to five of the National Monuments of Chile : Agustín Ross Cultural Centre and Park ; the wooden railway station , Estación Pichilemu ; El Árbol tunnel ; and the Caballo de Agua . Part of the city was declared a Zona <unk> ( " Traditional Area " or " Heritage Site " ) by the National Monuments Council , in 2004 . 
 The city is part of District No. 35 and is in the ninth senatorial constituency of O 'Higgins Region electoral division . Pichilemu is home to the main beach in O 'Higgins Region . It is a tourist destination for surfing , windsurfing and <unk> . 
 Tourism is the main industry of the city , but forestry and handicrafts are also important . Pichilemu has many expansive dark sand beaches . Several surf championships take place in the city each year at Punta de Lobos , which according to Fodor 's is " widely considered the best surfing in South America all year @-@ round . "
