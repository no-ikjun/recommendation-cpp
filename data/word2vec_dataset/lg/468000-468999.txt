 Burnet 's connections to the court procured for him an appointment as the Comptroller of Customs in Great Britain . He also invested heavily in the South Sea Company , whose collapse in 1720 led him to consider more lucrative positions in the North American colonies . Correspondence with a longtime friend , Robert Hunter , who returned to England in 1719 provided an opportunity : Hunter was then the governor of New York and New Jersey , and he had returned to England for a variety of personal reasons , intending to divest himself of those posts . Hunter and Burnet were both well @-@ connected to the Whig government then in power , so an exchange of their offices was readily approved . 
 = = = New Jersey = = = 
 Burnet 's tenure as New Jersey governor was marked by disputes over the issuance of bills of credit and the granting of a permanent salary . Bills of credit , in addition to providing funding for the province 's expenses , also circulated as local currency . Issuance of large quantities of such bills had an inflationary tendency to devalue them relative to the pound sterling . Burnet was under instructions to disallow their issuance except under certain conditions . When the provincial assembly in 1721 approved a bill that called for the issuance of £ 40 @,@ 000 in bills secured by property mortgages Burnet dissolved the assembly . However , he approved similar legislation in 1723 in exchange for the legislature 's approval of a five @-@ year salary plan . When the assembly began appropriating funds from the bills in unapproved ways a few years later , Burnet was again convinced to sign in exchange for a grant of £ 500 for " incidental expenses " . This method by which the assembly essentially bribed the governor for his agreement in violation of instructions became somewhat normal practice in New Jersey with later governors . 
 = = = New York = = = 
 In New York Burnet sided with the large landowners of the province ; based on their advice he refused to call elections for the provincial assembly , keeping an assembly dominated by " court party " members for five years . His relationship with the New York assembly only deteriorated after several special elections resulted in the addition of enough " country party " members to elect a hostile speaker . Although he sought to broaden the province 's tax base to include larger real estate holdings , the powerful property owners who dominated the assembly and the court party were successful in deflecting these efforts into taxes on merchant interests . One tax , levied on the tonnage of ships docking in New York , led to a rise in smuggling between New Jersey and New York . 
 Eight months after his arrival in New York , in May 1721 , Burnet married again . His bride was Anna Maria Van Horne , the daughter of Abraham and Mary Van Horne and a relative by marriage of Robert Livingston , a powerful New York landowner and one of Burnet 's chief advisors . They had four children ; she and the last child died not long after its birth in 1727 . 
 = = = Indian trading policy = = = 
 One of the more important aspects of Burnet 's tenure in New York was his attempts to strengthen the colony 's position on the frontier , and its relations with the Iroquois who then controlled most of what is now upstate New York . Since the Iroquois had achieved peace with New France in 1701 , a vibrant trade had begun between New York merchants in Albany and French merchants in Montreal . English goods were sold to French traders , who bartered those goods for furs with Native American tribes in central North America . British colonial administrators sought to alter this method of trade , instructing Burnet to direct the trade through the Iroquois lands instead of through Montreal , bringing an end to the Albany @-@ Montreal trade . 
 Not long after his arrival in New York , Burnet had the assembly pass a law banning the Albany @-@ Montreal trade . This action earned him opposition from merchant interests that traded directly with New France , including the Huguenot Stephen DeLancey and other Albany merchants . Two vocal merchants , Adolph Philipse and Pieter Schuyler , sat on the governor 's council , and were removed by Burnet in 1721 . The law was fairly easily circumvented : the merchants routed the trade goods through nearby Mohawks who then carried goods to and from Montreal . A law stiffening enforcement of the trade ban was passed in 1722 . These policies caused protest not only in New York , but also in London , where British merchants argued that they were having a negative impact on trade volume to Europe . 
 In 1723 Burnet was informed that the French had begun construction of Fort Niagara at the western end of Lake Ontario ; this action presented a clear threat to British attempts to more directly access and control the fur trade . He consequently ordered the construction of Fort Oswego at the mouth of the Oswego River . This decision not only upset Albany traders , who would lose their monopoly on the fur trade , but also upset the French ( because it gave the British direct access to Lake Ontario ) and the Iroquois , who had wanted a fort sited at Lake Oneida instead . Burnet tried to placate the Iroquois by stationing militia forces in the Oneida area , but they also resented this intrusion . 
 Burnet 's attempts to implement the trade policy were ultimately unsuccessful . In 1725 the merchant interests , Stephen DeLancey among them , succeeded in gaining seats in the assembly through special elections , and Burnet 's decision to question the citizenship of the Huguenot DeLancey ( and thus his right to a seat in the assembly ) angered many moderates in that body . In the following years the assembly was noticeably more hostile to his rule . The trade ban was repealed in 1726 and replaced by a system of taxation designed to prefer western trade over the Albany @-@ Montreal trade . By the time of his departure in 1727 it was clear that this policy was also not working , and in some cases was having negative effects . All laws respecting Indian trade that passed during his administration were repealed in 1729 ; the only long @-@ term effects were the establishment of the British military presence at Oswego , and the breaking of Albany 's monopoly on trade . Burnet also left New York more <unk> divided between merchants and landowners than when he arrived . 
 = = = Replacement = = = 
 In 1727 King George I died , an event that required the renewal of royal commissions . George II decided to give the New York and New Jersey governorships to Colonel John Montgomerie , who had served him as a Groom of the Bedchamber . Burnet was instead given appointment as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire . 
 After it became known in New York that Burnet would be replaced , the assembly , at the instigation of Stephen DeLancey , as a parting shot formally protested Burnet 's actions as a chancery court judge , declaring that his judgments would be null and void . Montgomerie arrived in New York on 15 April 1728 , carrying Burnet 's commissions ; Burnet left New York in July for Boston . 
 = = Governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire = = 
 Burnet was only briefly in New Hampshire during his short tenure , where unlike Massachusetts he was readily granted a salary for three years or the duration of his administration . At the time of his appointment to the Massachusetts seat , the province had been governed for a number of years by Lieutenant Governor William Dummer , acting for Governor Samuel Shute . Burnet made a <unk> attempt to force the Massachusetts assembly to grant him a permanent salary . Since the institution of the royal charter in 1692 , the assembly had steadfastly resisted this , choosing instead to make periodic grants to the governor . Local politicians found this an effective mechanism for influencing the governor to approve their policies , since the governor would never know when the next grant would be made , or how large it would be . The salary matter was one of many that had vexed Governor Shute during his time in the province . Dummer , a wealthy Massachusetts native , had been more conciliatory , only insisting that control of the provincial militia remain in his hands . 
 Burnet chose to take an extremely hard line on the subject of the salary : he refused to conduct any other business , or to dissolve the legislature , until the salary was decided . The legislature in turn refused to enact a salary bill , although it offered generous one @-@ time grants that Burnet refused on principle . He further raised tensions by implicitly suggesting that the assembly 's failure to act on the salary might jeopardize the colonial charter . In order to make life as difficult as possible for the legislators , Burnet relocated the assembly from Boston first to Salem and then Cambridge , increasing the costs of the legislators and forcing many of them from the comforts of their Boston @-@ area properties . In November 1728 the assembly voted to send agents to London to argue their side of the issue with the Board of Trade . Its attempts to appropriate funds for the agents were denied by the governor 's council , and the agents ended up being paid from funds raised by subscription . 
 In May 1729 the Board of Trade ruled , siding with Governor Burnet , but the assembly still refused to yield . Attempts to conduct business on other matters invariably became caught up in the salary dispute , and thus stalled . The dispute was still ongoing when Burnet , en route from Cambridge to Boston on 31 August , was thrown into water when his carriage accidentally overturned . He fell ill , and died on 7 September 1729 . He was interred in the King 's Chapel Burying Ground in Boston . 
 Lieutenant Governor Dummer again acted as governor until Burnet 's replacement ( Jonathan Belcher , one of the agents who had been sent to London ) was selected and returned to the province . He took a similar position as Burnet , refusing annual grants until he was replaced as lieutenant ( and acting ) governor by William Tailer , who acquiesced to annual grants . Jonathan Belcher , who became governor later in 1730 , was at first instructed as Burnet was on the matter of the salary , but during his tenure the Boards of Trade finally abandoned the instruction , and allowed him to receive annual grants . 
 = The Pioneer Mother Memorial = 
 The Pioneer Mother Memorial , also known as Pioneer Mother and Pioneer Mothers , is a 1928 bronze sculpture by American artist Avard Fairbanks , installed at Esther Short Park in Vancouver , Washington , in the United States . The memorial depicts a mother and three children , and commemorates pioneer mothers who settled in the Pacific Northwest . The main female figure may depict Esther Short , one of the first U.S. citizens to arrive in Fort Vancouver . Commissioned by Vancouver banker Edward Crawford and his wife Ida for $ 10 @,@ 000 , it is one of the city 's oldest works of public art , acquired in 1928 and unveiled in 1929 . The sculpture was renovated around the start of the 21st century and is maintained by the City of Vancouver 's Parks & Recreation department . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Pioneer Mother Memorial is installed at Esther Short Park 's north entrance , at the intersection of West 8th and Daniel Street ( between Columbia and Esther Streets ) in Vancouver , Washington . The park commemorates the pioneer woman and her husband Amos , who were among the first U.S. citizens to arrive in Fort Vancouver . Some sources say the memorial sculpture commemorates Esther Short specifically , while also " [ typifying ] all the brave mothers of the frontier " who settled in the Pacific Northwest . Some sources say the sculpture 's main female figure is Short herself , per the dedication ceremony 's program . The sculpture was cast in Florence , Italy , where Fairbanks was working on his Guggenheim Fellowship . 
 The memorial features a full @-@ length bronze figure depicting a mother and three children . The woman wears traditional pioneer clothing , including a long dress , shawl , and shoes . She stands , facing forward , and holds a flintlock rifle in her proper right hand . The woman 's opposite hand rests on the head of the taller of two girls at her proper left side . The taller girl holds the shorter one with her proper left hand , while the shorter girl faces the taller one and rests against the mother 's proper left knee . A young boy clings to the mother 's dress and leans against her rifle . The sculpture measures approximately 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) × 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) × 21 inches ( 53 cm ) and rests on a concrete and granite base that measures approximately 102 inches ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) × 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) × 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) . 
 Behind the figure group is a concrete backdrop . Its reverse side includes a bronze medallion with a bas @-@ relief depicting a team of oxen pulling a covered wagon . The animals are led by a man , and an " anxious " woman and baby are in the wagon . A large barrel is attached to the wagon . The bottom of the medallion includes a relief of a cattle skull . The medallion has a diameter of approximately 36 inches ( 91 cm ) . 
 The memorial includes several inscriptions . One by the woman 's foot reads , Avard Fairbanks / 1928 . The medallion has two inscriptions : one below the wagon displays a copyright symbol and reads , 1928 Avard Fairbanks , while another says , THE / PIONEER / MOTHERS . On the concrete backdrop below the medallion is the signed inscription : ERECTED IN MEMORY OF / THE PIONEER MOTHERS / <unk> THE <unk> OF / MR. & <unk> E. G. <unk> / 1928 .

 The Pioneer Mother Memorial is one of Vancouver 's oldest works of public art ( the oldest , according to the Clark County Historical Museum ) , acquired in 1928 and unveiled on July 21 , 1929 ( or September 7 , according to some sources ) . Fairbanks attended the ceremony . The artist was commissioned to create the memorial by Vancouver banker Edward Crawford and his wife Ida , who donated $ 10 @,@ 000 to its creation . 
 The work was classified as needing treatment by the Smithsonian Institution 's " Save Outdoor Sculpture ! " program in May 1995 . It was renovated as part of park improvement efforts around the start of the 21st century . The memorial is maintained by the City of Vancouver 's Parks & Recreation department .

 Abu <unk> al @-@ Jarrah ibn <unk> al @-@ Hakami ( Arabic : أبو <unk> <unk> بن عبد الله <unk> ) was an Arab nobleman and general of the Hakami tribe . During the course of the early 8th century , he was at various times governor of Basra , Sistan and Khurasan , Armenia and Azerbaijan . A legendary warrior already during his lifetime , he is best known for his campaigns against the Khazars on the Caucasus front , culminating in his death in the Battle of Marj Ardabil in 730 .

 According to Baladhuri , al @-@ Jarrah was born in Jordan , and probably followed Sufyan ibn al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Kalbi and Abd al @-@ Rahman ibn Habib al @-@ Hakami to Iraq in 696 . In 701 , he fought against the rebellion of Ibn al @-@ Ash 'ath . 
 In 706 or a few years later he was appointed as governor of Basra under the governor of Iraq , al @-@ Hajjaj ibn Yusuf , and remained in the post until al @-@ Hajjaj 's replacement by Yazid ibn al @-@ Muhallab in 715 . Yazid in turn named al @-@ Jarrah as his deputy for Iraq , before he himself left for Khurasan , and in 717 , Caliph Umar II ( r . 717 – 720 ) appointed al @-@ <unk> as Yazid 's successor in the governorship of Khurasan and Sistan . Al @-@ Jarrah remained in Khurasan until March / April 719 , when he was dismissed after 17 months in office due to complaints of his mistreatment of the native converts to Islam ( mawali ) , who , despite their conversion , were still obliged to pay the poll @-@ tax ( jizya ) . He was replaced by his deputy , Abd al @-@ Rahman ibn Nu 'aym al @-@ <unk> . The most notable event of his tenure was the beginning of the covert missionary activity ( da <unk> ) by the agents of the Abbasids in Khurasan . After his return to Iraq , in 720 , he seems to have fought alongside Maslamah ibn Abd al @-@ Malik in the suppression of the rebellion of Yazid ibn al @-@ Muhallab . 
 = = In the Caucasus = = 
 In 721 / 2 , the main phase of the Second Arab – Khazar War began on the Caucasus front . In the winter of this year , 30 @,@ 000 Khazars launched an invasion of Armenia and inflicted a crushing defeat on the army of the local governor Mi <unk> ibn Saffar al @-@ Bahrani at Marj al @-@ <unk> in February / March 722 . In response , Caliph Yazid II ( r . 720 – 724 ) sent al @-@ Jarrah with 25 @,@ 000 Syrian troops to Armenia , placing him in command of the Umayyad offensive against the Khazars . Al @-@ Jarrah was swiftly successful in driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus , and fought his way north along the western coast of the Caspian Sea , recovering Derbent and advancing onto the Khazar capital of Balanjar . The Khazars tried to defend the city by ringing the citadel with a laager of wagons , but the Arabs broke it apart and stormed the city on 21 August 722 ( or 723 ) . Most of Balanjar 's inhabitants were killed or enslaved , but a few managed to flee north . The Arabs also took the town of <unk> , and even approached Samandar ( near modern <unk> ) . 
 Despite these successes , the Arabs could not achieve a decisive result . The main Khazar army remained intact and a constant threat , since like all nomad forces it was not dependent on cities for supplies . Coupled with the fact that his rear was still insecure , al @-@ Jarrah was forced to abandon any attempt at capturing Samandar as well , and to retreat to Warthan south of the Caucasus . From there he asked for reinforcements from Yazid , but although the Caliph promised to send more troops , he failed to do so . The sources are obscure on al @-@ Jarrah 's activity in 723 , but he seems to have led another campaign north ( which may indeed be the true date of the Balanjar campaign ) . In response , the Khazars raided south of the Caucasus , but in February 724 , al @-@ Jarrah inflicted a crushing defeat on them in a battle between the rivers Cyrus and Araxes that lasted for several days . Al @-@ Jarrah followed up his success by capturing Tiflis , whose inhabitants were obliged to pay the kharaj but received a charter of rights in return . This campaign brought Caucasian Iberia and the lands of the Alans under Muslim suzerainty , and al @-@ Jarrah became the first Muslim commander to march through the Darial Pass in the process . This expedition secured the Muslims ' own flank against a possible Khazar attack through the Darial , while conversely it gave the Muslim army a second invasion route into Khazar territory . 
 In 725 , however , the new Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al @-@ Malik ( r . 724 – 743 ) replaced al @-@ Jarrah with his own brother Maslamah ibn Abd al @-@ Malik .

 In 729 , after a mixed performance against the Khazars , Maslamah was replaced yet again as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan by al @-@ Jarrah . For all his energy , Maslamah 's campaigning failed to produce the desired results : by the time of his dismissal , the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and been thrust once more into the defensive , with al @-@ Jarrah again having to defend Adharbayjan against a Khazar invasion . 
 In 730 , al @-@ Jarrah returned to the offensive through Tiflis and the Darial Pass . Arab sources report that he reached as far as the Khazar capital , al @-@ Bayda , on the Volga , but modern historians such as Khalid Yahya Blankinship consider this improbable . Soon after , he was forced back to Bardha 'a to defend Arran from invasion by the Khazar general <unk> . It is unclear whether the Khazars moved through the Darial Pass or the Caspian Gates , but they succeeded in outmanoeuvring al @-@ Jarrah , bypassing the Arab forces and laying siege to Ardabil , the capital of Adharbayjan , where 30 @,@ 000 Muslim troops and their families were gathered . News of this development forced al @-@ Jarrah to hastily withdraw from Bardha 'a and march south in a rapid march to Ardabil 's rescue .

 Al @-@ Jarrah 's death caused widespread lamentation in the Muslim world , particularly among the soldiers , as he had achieved a legendary status already during his lifetime : the " paradigmatic general " ( Patricia Crone ) , he had an impressive physical presence — according to tradition , he was so tall that when he entered the Great Mosque of Damascus , his head seemed to be suspended from the lamps — and his military prowess was celebrated with the sobriquets " hero of Islam " ( <unk> al @-@ <unk> ) and " Cavalier of the Syrians " ( <unk> Ahl al @-@ <unk> ) .

 The series ' original lead Lauren Conrad first indicated that she wished to leave The Hills upon the conclusion of its fourth season in December 2008 , looking to pursue other career opportunities . She commented that " five years on TV is a really , really long time " , adding that she was " ready to walk away " . However , per the producers ' requests , Conrad filmed ten episodes for the fifth season , in which she closed her storylines .

 The tenth episode of the season , " Something Old , Something New " , aired on May 31 , 2009 , and was initially billed as the fifth season finale . However , in April 2009 , MTV announced an extension of the season , and confirmed Cavallari as Conrad 's replacement the following month . Consequentially , the first ten episodes of the season were retroactively labeled Part I , while Cavallari 's forthcoming episodes were titled Part II .

 = Great Britain at the 2010 Winter Paralympics = 
 Great Britain competed at the 2010 Winter Paralympics held in Vancouver , Canada . The team was made up of athletes from the whole United Kingdom ; athletes from Northern Ireland , who may elect to hold Irish citizenship under the pre @-@ 1999 article 2 of the Irish constitution , are able to be selected to represent either Great Britain or Ireland at the Paralympics . Kelly Gallagher became the first Northern Irish athlete to compete in the Winter Paralympics by taking part in the alpine skiing discipline . Additionally some British overseas territories compete separately from Britain in Paralympic competition . In order to be eligible to take part in the Games athletes had to have a disability that fell into one of the five Paralympics disability categories . 
 Great Britain fielded twelve athletes in total ; a team of five in wheelchair curling , and seven athletes in alpine skiing . The team failed to win a medal for the first time since the 2002 Games , when just two British athletes competed , and although several of the squad finished with top ten results , the overall outcome was described as disappointing . Kelly Gallagher came closest to a medal , finishing fourth in the giant slalom for visually impaired athletes . Britain will be hosting the next Games when London hosts the 2012 Summer Paralympics . 
 = = Disability classification = = 
 Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories ; amputation , the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness ; cerebral palsy ; wheelchair athletes , there is often overlap between this and other categories ; visual impairment , including blindness ; Les autres , any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories , for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis . Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications , dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition . Events are given a code , made of numbers and letters , describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing . Events with " B " in the code are for athletes with visual impairment , codes LW1 to LW9 are for athletes who stand to compete and LW10 to LW12 are for athletes who compete sitting down . For the 2010 Paralympics alpine skiing events grouped athletes in to sitting , standing and visually impaired . In biathlon events , which contain a target shooting component , blind and visually impaired athletes are able to compete through the use of acoustic signals , whose signal intensity varies dependent upon whether or not the athlete is on target . Wheelchair curling , first added to the Games in 2006 in Turin , is open to athletes with a physical disability in the lower part of the body that requires the everyday use of a wheelchair . Stones may be played by hand while leaning over the side of the wheelchair , or pushed by a delivery stick .

Sean Rose and Anna Turney also achieved top ten finishes . Jane Sowerby 's preparations were disrupted by a broken collarbone suffered in November 2009 .

McCreadie , who was competing in his seventh Paralympics , won two bronze medals for Lawn Bowls in the 1976 Summer Paralympics and Killin was a previous silver medalist in wheelchair fencing at the 1980 Summer Games . 
 Paralympic wheelchair curling is played according to the rules of the World Curling Federation , the only modification is that there is no sweeping . The sport was open to both male and female athletes who competed in mixed teams , with a requirement that each team had at least one member of each sex . The format was a round @-@ robin tournament ; each nation played all others in a group stage with the top four qualifying for medal playoffs . Great Britain won three of their nine group games , beating teams from Switzerland , Germany , and Japan . They finished in sixth position , which meant that they did not advance to the medal matches .

In 534 , on account of his rhetorical skills , he was employed as an imperial envoy to the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna . At the time , a power struggle was developing there between Queen Amalasuntha , regent to the young king Athalaric , and her cousin Theodahad . Following the death of Athalaric , Theodahad usurped the throne , imprisoned Amalasuntha , and sent messages to Emperor Justinian hoping for recognition . Peter met the envoys at <unk> , on his way to Italy , and notified Constantinople , seeking new instructions . Emperor Justinian ordered him to convey the message to Theodahad that Amalasuntha was under the Emperor 's protection and not to be harmed . Nevertheless , at the time Peter arrived in Italy , Amalasuntha had been killed ; Procopius 's narrative in the Gothic War is ambiguous here , but in his Secret History , he explicitly claims that Peter arranged the murder of Amalasuntha on instructions from Theodora , who feared her as a potential rival for Justinian 's attentions . Whatever assurances might have been privately given by Theodora to Theodahad , in public , Peter strongly condemned the act , and declared that there would be " war without truce between the emperor and themselves " as a result . 
 Peter then returned to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple , bearing pleas for a peaceful solution , but by the time he reached the imperial capital , Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces . Consequently , Peter returned to Italy in the summer of 535 conveying an ultimatum : only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule , could war be averted . A two @-@ pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter , attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom : Belisarius took Sicily , while Mundus invaded Dalmatia . Upon hearing these news , Theodahad despaired , and Peter was able to secure wide @-@ ranging concessions from him : Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire ; the Gothic king 's authority within Italy was severely restricted ; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3 @,@ 000 men were to be provided for the imperial army , underlining Theodahad 's subject status . Theodahad , however , fearing that his first offer would be rejected , then instructed Peter , under oath , to offer the cession of all Italy , but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian . In the event , Justinian rejected the first proposal , and was delighted to learn of the second one . Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius , bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles , and for a time it seemed as if the cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold . It was not to be : upon their arrival in Ravenna , the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition . Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia , he resolved to resist , and imprisoned the ambassadors . 
 = = = Magister officiorum = = = 
 Peter remained imprisoned in Ravenna for three years , until released in June / July 539 by the new Gothic king , <unk> , in exchange for Gothic envoys sent to Persia who had been captured by the Byzantines . As a reward for his services , Emperor Justinian then appointed Peter to the post of magister officiorum ( " Master of the Offices " ) , one of the highest positions in the state , heading the palace secretariat , the imperial guards ( the Scholae Palatinae ) , and the Public Post with the dreaded <unk> in rebus . He would hold this post for 26 consecutive years , longer by a wide margin than any other before or after . At about the same time or shortly thereafter , he was raised to the supreme title of patrician and the supreme senatorial rank of <unk> ( " most glorious one " ) . He was also awarded an honorary consulship . As magister , he took part in the discussions with Western bishops in 548 on the Three @-@ Chapter Controversy , and was repeatedly sent as an envoy in 551 – 553 to Pope Vigilius , who opposed the emperor on the issue . Peter is also recorded as attending the Second Council of Constantinople in May 553 . 
 In 550 , he was sent as envoy by Justinian to negotiate a peace treaty with Persia , a role he reprised in 561 , when he met the Persian envoy <unk> <unk> at Dara , to end the Lazic War . Reaching an agreement over the Persian evacuation of Lazica and the delineation of the border in Armenia , the two envoys concluded a fifty @-@ year peace between the two empires and their respective allies . The annual Roman subsidies to Persia would resume , but the amount was lowered from 500 to 420 pounds of gold . Further clauses regulated cross @-@ border trade , which was to be limited to the two cities of Dara and Nisibis , the return of fugitives , and the protection of the respective religious minorities ( Christians in the Persian Empire and Zoroastrians in Byzantium ) . In exchange for Persian recognition for the existence of Dara , whose construction had originally sparked a brief war , the Byzantines agreed to limit their troops there and remove the seat of the magister militum per Orientem from the city . As disagreements remained on two border areas , <unk> and Ambros , in spring 562 , Peter travelled to Persia to negotiate directly with the Persian Shah , Chosroes I , without however achieving a result . He then returned to Constantinople , where he died sometime after March 565 . 
 His son Theodore , nicknamed <unk> or <unk> , would succeed him as magister officiorum in 566 , after a brief interval where the post was held by the quaestor sacri <unk> ( " <unk> of the Sacred Palace " ) Anastasius . He held the post until some time before 576 , being appointed as comes <unk> <unk> ( " Count of the Sacred <unk> " ) thereafter ; in the same year , he also led an unsuccessful embassy to Persia to end the ongoing war over the Caucasus . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 As one of the leading officials of the age , Peter was a controversial figure , receiving greatly differing assessments from his contemporaries . To John <unk> , a mid @-@ level bureaucrat of the praetorian prefecture of the East , Peter was a paragon of every virtue , an intelligent , firm but fair administrator and a kind man . Procopius also attests to his mild manners and desire to avoid giving insult , however at the same time he accuses him of " robbing the <unk> " ( the members of the Scholae ) and being " the biggest thief in the world and absolutely filled with shameful avarice " , as well as being responsible for the murder of Amalasuntha . 
 From quite early in his career , Peter was renowned for his learning , his passion for reading , and his discussions with scholars . As a speaker , he was eloquent and persuasive ; Procopius calls him " fitted by nature to persuade men " , while Cassiodorus , who witnessed his embassies to the Ostrogoth court , also praises him as vir <unk> and <unk> ( " most eloquent man " ) , and as <unk> ( " most wise " ) . On the other hand , the late 6th @-@ century historian Menander Protector , who relied on Peter 's work for his own history , accuses him of boastfulness and of rewriting the records to enhance his own role and performance in the negotiations with the Persians . 
 = = Writings = = 
 Peter wrote three books , all of which survive only in fragments : a history of the first four centuries of the Roman Empire , from the death of Julius Caesar in 44 BC to the death of Emperor Constantius II ( r . 337 – 361 ) in 361 AD , of which about twenty fragments are extant ; a history of the office of magister officiorum from its institution under Emperor Constantine the Great ( r . 306 – 337 ) to the time of Emperor Justinian , containing a list of its holders and descriptions of various imperial ceremonies , several of which are reproduced in chapters 84 – 95 of the first volume of the 10th @-@ century De Ceremoniis of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos ( r . 913 – 959 ) ; and an account of his diplomatic mission to the Persian Empire in 561 – 562 , which has been used as a source by Menander Protector . Until recently , Peter was also ascribed the authorship of the 6th @-@ century Peri <unk> <unk> ( " On Political Science " ) , a six @-@ volume book discussing political theory , drawing extensively from Classical texts such as Plato 's The Republic and Cicero 's De re publica . It too survives only in fragments . 
 Peter was the first late Roman / Byzantine author to write on imperial ceremonies , beginning a tradition that lasted unto the 14th century . His histories are also an important historical source ; for instance , his work alone preserves the negotiations and provisions of the Roman – Persian treaty of 298 between Galerius and Narseh . 
 The Lost History of Peter the Patrician , published by Routledge in 2015 , is an annotated translation from the Greek by Thomas M. <unk> of the fragments of Peter ’ s History , including additional fragments which used to be considered the work of the Roman historian Cassius Dio 's so @-@ called Anonymous <unk> . 
 = Trondheim Central Station = 
 Trondheim Central Station ( Norwegian : Trondheim <unk> ) or Trondheim S is the main railway station serving the city of Trondheim , Norway . Located at Brattøra in the north part of the city centre , it is the terminus of the Dovre Line , running southwards , and the Nordland Line , which runs north . The railway is electrified south of the station but not north of it , so through trains must change locomotives at the station . 
 The Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) serves the station with express trains to Oslo and Bodø , regional trains to Røros and Östersund in Sweden , and the Trøndelag Commuter Rail . The Trondheim Bus Station located at the station serves all long @-@ distance buses , and some city buses . From 1913 to 1968 the station was also the terminus for two lines of the Trondheim Tramway . 
 Trondheim 's first station , dating from 1864 , was located at Kalvskinnet . In 1877 the current station was built to serve the Meråker Line line to Sweden — since integrated into the Nordland Line . At the same time a connection was built between the two stations , and the central station took over as the main station serving Trondheim . In 1910 construction of a new station for the Dovre Line was started , finishing in 1921 . The main station building consists of an older section in historicism brick , while the annex is in <unk> concrete and glass . 
 = = Services = = 
 Train services are provided by the Norwegian State Railways both north- and southbound . Four services a day and one night train operate to Oslo Central Station , while there is one day and one night train to Bodø , with an additional afternoon departure to Mo i Rana . Two daily departures serve Sweden and Östersund as part of the Mittnabotåget service that connects Trondheim in Norway to Sundsvall in Sweden , in addition there are three services to Røros , with connections onwards to Østerdalen . The most frequent service is the hourly Trøndelag Commuter Rail from Steinkjer via Trondheim Airport , Værnes and Trondheim S to Lerkendal , with some extending to Oppdal . 
 The station is manned , but also equipped with ticket machines . There are several kiosks and cafés , as well as a car park , taxicabs , bicycle stands and baggage lockers . The station and platforms are wheelchair accessible , and a pre @-@ booked escort service is available . <unk> <unk> @-@ Norge , which sells bus tickets and provides information on public transport routes in Trøndelag , can be found in the new section . The station is closed at night . 
 The commuter trains serve other railway stations in neighborhoods in Trondheim ; Heimdal , <unk> , Marienborg , Skansen to the south , and Lademoen / Nedre Elvehavn , Lilleby , Leangen and Rotvoll to the east .

 In 1995 , the city bus station was moved from <unk> close to the city 's main square to the central station , with the opening of a new section to the station . The original building has been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage as a cultural heritage . 
 Some city buses operated by Team <unk> stop at the station ; routes 2 , 11 , 19 , 46 , 47 , 52 , 54 , 55 , 63 , 71 , 73 , 75 , 76 , 94 . <unk> Terminal remains the most important , with all buses stopping there .

 = = = Two stations = = = 
 The first railway station to be built in Trondheim was located at Kalvskinnet , to serve the narrow gauge Trondhjem – Støren Line railway that was completed in 1864 . The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull , and still exists as a synagogue . In 1877 the state and city made an agreement to build a new station at Brattøra to serve the new Meråker Line that was being built to Sweden . Brattøra was chosen because it was located directly beside the port , and would allow direct transshipment from ships to the railway of both goods and passengers . The station would become the main station for both railways ; this caused a major protest among the local population , who felt it was necessary to have two terminal stations , one for each line , and the city brought the matter before the courts — the case was settled in 1895 in favor of one station . The lack of planning and coordination between the two lines made the new station a large budget cost for the Meråker Line ; and described as one of few exceptions to the small @-@ and @-@ cheap policy dominating the state railways i Norway at the time . 
 Two lots were sold to the state railways from the city , allowing the building of two station buildings , the eastern cargo building for the Meråker Line and the western for Røros Line . The main station in the east served all passenger trains , and was designed by the architect Balthazar Lange . A new route for Røros Line was built from <unk> to Skansen , along the west side of Nidelva , and the old station taken into disuse after the Røros Line reached the central station on 24 June 1884 . To solve the challenge of the break @-@ of @-@ gauge , the entire station area had dual gauge with both 1 @,@ 435 mm ( 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ) and 1 @,@ 067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) . 
 The station at Brattøra has had four names , following the name changes of the city . It was opened as Throndhjem , changed in 1894 to Trondhjem , on 1 January 1930 to Nidaros and to Trondheim on 6 March 1931 . The station at Brattøra is physically divided in two parts by the bridge over <unk> . From 1884 , the western part was officially called Throndhjem V and the eastern part Throndhjem Ø . The freight station for the Røros Line was located at Throndhjem V , while the passenger station for both lines was located at Throndhjem Ø , just like today . While there were two stations in 1882 – 84 , they were ' probably ' referred to as Brattøra and Kalvskinnet . 
 On 23 April 1888 a landslide hit the station , with 180 metres ( 590 ft ) of track — three wide and including the main <unk> line — was washed into the sea . The slide was caused by the seabed sinking about seven meters , and it was followed by several smaller slides . 
 = = = The Dovre Line arrives = = = 
 In 1910 , the Parliament of Norway announced a competition for the redesign of the station since it had been decided that the Dovre Line would be built to Trondheim , including the line from Støren to Trondheim being converted to standard gauge . On 18 August 1913 construction of a new station and port was started . Traffic had increased to the limits of capacity ; there were too few tracks and too small cargo buildings . By 1912 some freight cars were stopping at Hommelvik and Storlien ; a counting showed 900 cars at the station . The construction removed a gap filled by the canal between the two stations — filling up the canal in the process . Instead the 92 metres ( 302 ft ) Skansen Bridge was built on the west side of the station , along with a double track to Marienborg where the new depot would be located . The main station building designed by Lange remained the passenger and administration building , with the conversion of the smaller , western one into cargo facilities . 
 The amount of trackage for cargo was increased , with a wide section of land mass being filled into the sea to create a larger rail and port facility at Brattøra , though the filling of a large part of the seabed to create artificial land . The railways allowed the transshipment of cargo from ships from Northern Norway to rail , as well as from rail from Central Sweden to ships to the British Isles . The port was supplemented by a new line to <unk> would allow the loading of ore there . The suggestion to build double track to Leangen was dropped . 
 While the original plans for the Dovre Line involved completion in 1916 , it was not until 1921 the first train could travel from Oslo to Trondheim via Dovre , mostly due to the First World War . The new depot opened in 1916 , and in 1917 the double track and dual gauge to Marienborg as well as the new freight terminal was finished . Instead of using one track for each direction on the double track , the Dovre Line would use the one line while the other would be used for transport from the station to the depot . Skansen Bridge opened on 22 March 1918 . In 1922 , Norsk Spisevognselskap established a kiosk , and on 1 October 1925 , they took over the station restaurant . 
 The main building designed by Lange is in historicism and was originally built in two stories in brick . A third was added in the 1950s , some with some of the original feel being lost in the addition , since it was not stylistically true . In 1965 two annexes were built , one on each side and in two stories . The western was used for offices and the other as part of the waiting area — these were both in line with the historicist style . They replaced a cargo expedition and a restaurant building , respectively . In 1995 the bus station was moved from the city center at <unk> to the central station , and the eastern annex was razed in favor of a <unk> glass and concrete building . In addition to the bus station it features and extension of the waiting area , offices , a restaurant and a parking lot . 
 = County Road 595 ( Marquette County , Michigan ) = 
 County Road 595 ( CR 595 , Co . Rd . 595 ) is a proposed primary county road in Marquette County in the US state of Michigan . The road would provide access from the northern part of the county , near the Eagle Mine in Michigamme Township , to US Highway 41 ( US 41 ) and M @-@ 28 in Humboldt Township . The approximately 21 @.@ 5 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 34 @.@ 6 km ) road would be used primarily for commercial truck traffic hauling rock from the Eagle Mine to a processing facility south of US 41 / M @-@ 28 in Humboldt Township . At present , such traffic has to use existing county roads which involves passing through the cities of Marquette , Negaunee , and Ishpeming . The northern end would be northeast of the mine in Champion Township at an intersection with the Triple A Road ( Co . Rd . AAA ) . 
 In 2003 , a flood along the Dead River destroyed or forced the closure of several bridges over the river , isolating the northern half of the county . In 2007 , Kennecott Minerals received permission to operate the Eagle Mine in the northern part of Marquette County . The company , in a consortium with other local businesses , proposed the construction of a new road to connect their mine with their mill at the former Humboldt Mine . This project , called Woodland Road , was to be built by these private interests . After encountering permitting issues , the private companies involved canceled the project . 
 The Marquette County Road Commission ( MCRC ) applied for permits from the state and federal governments in 2010 , reviving the road as CR 595 . Kennecott pledged to finance construction , but removed its support in early 2011 over uncertainty in the permit timetable . After protests from the City of Marquette and local residents , Kennecott restored its commitments to the project . The MCRC moved forward through the permitting process in 2012 . The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) filed two formal objections to the road . In response , the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) , the state @-@ level agency handling the permit application , opened a public comment period and held a public hearing on the matter . Several groups spoke in support and opposition , various local , state and federal officials expressed support for the project , and the EPA maintained its objections . After several deadline extensions , the agency lifted one objection and reiterated a second , setting a 30 @-@ day timetable in December 2012 for a final decision . The DEQ was forced to deny the permit on January 3 , 2013 , based on the EPA position on CR 595 . With that action , Kennecott Minerals diverted its financial support from the project to upgrade existing roads instead . In late December 2014 , state legislators announced interest in suing the EPA in an effort to force federal permits to be issued to build the roadway ; the MCRC announced their intent to sue the EPA in January 2015 , and the suit was filed on July 8 , 2015 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The county road would start at its southern end at an intersection with US 41 / M @-@ 28 in Humboldt Township . This intersection will be east of the intersection known as Koski Corners , where US 41 / M @-@ 28 intersects M @-@ 95 . From its terminus , CR 595 would run north and pass into Champion Township near a crossing of a line of the Canadian National Railway before turning eastward . The road would cross the Middle Branch of the Escanaba River and continued northeasterly into the adjacent Ely Township . Planning maps from late 2011 show CR 595 following what is now Wolf Lake Road in the area but bypassing some curves to follow a straighter route . South of <unk> Lake , the new county road would have crossed the Second River and turned northwesterly parallel to <unk> Road back into Champion Township . This proposed route would have turned back northward near Wolf Lake , crossed <unk> Creek and passed to the west of Silver Lake through hilly terrain . Immediately west of Silver Lake , CR 595 would have crossed the Dead River and Wildcat Canyon Creek . Through this area , the road was to pass through land owned by one of a few timber companies and other developers . To the north , there would have been a crossing of Mulligan Creek in Michigamme Township south of the mine property . North of the mine , CR 595 was to turn northeasterly through the Yellow Dog Plains and cross the Yellow Dog River before re @-@ entering Champion Township . Immediately after crossing that political boundary , CR 595 would have terminated at the intersection with the Triple A Road ( Co . Rd . AAA ) near the Salmon Trout River . Along the proposed route , the terrain is heavily forested and hilly , except in the vicinity of the lakes , rivers and streams where there are wetlands .

 On May 14 , 2003 , a section of the Silver Lake Dam failed in northwestern Marquette County . The area received 4 inches ( 100 mm ) of rain , and an earthen dike breached . The failure sent 9 billion US gallons ( 34 Gl ) of water rushing down the Dead River . The flood waters forced the closure of the Steel Bridge carrying CR 510 over the river . As the waters approached the city of Marquette , the old CR 550 bridge was submerged , and the newer parallel structure that carries CR 550 was closed to traffic as well . The effect of these road closures isolated Big Bay from the rest of the county . The flooding damaged or destroyed the bridges carrying county roads AAO and AAT over the river , as well as the Lakeshore Boulevard and old CR 550 bridges . Several other bridges on tributaries of the Dead River were impacted by flooding . The MCRC and City of Marquette estimated that the road @-@ related damages were in the neighborhood of $ 650 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 915 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) . 
 Since the flood a new , roughly 100 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 30 m ) bridge has been constructed on CR 510 , ensuring that any future flooding on the Dead River would not necessitate closure of the modern bridge . This structure was built at that height in order to benefit commercial interests in the area , as well as to provide the area with reliable public and emergency access . 
 Rio Tinto Group , the British @-@ based parent company of Kennecott Minerals received permission in 2007 to operate a nickel mine on the Yellow Dog Plains in Marquette County . The mine , dubbed Project Eagle or the Eagle Mine by the company , has been controversial with area residents . Some residents have praised the project as good for the economy , while others including area Indian tribes , have opposed the development citing environmental concerns . Lawsuits have delayed construction and operation of the mine , in addition to economic concerns . Kennecott started construction on the mine in 2011 , and they expect to begin mineral extraction in 2013 . Opposition to the mine and its operation has also extended to plans to construct a new road to carry the ore from the mine to a mill for processing . 
 = = = Woodland Road = = = 
 Kennecott Minerals , in a consortium with other businesses , originally proposed a privately built road in the area called Woodland Road . The group included the Michigan Forest Products Council , a local construction company , and local landowners . Kennecott wanted the road to shorten the truck route from the Eagle Mine to its processing mill in Humboldt Township from 60 to 22 miles ( 97 to 35 km ) over the previously approved route along the Triple A Road ( Co . Rd . AAA ) , CR 510 , CR 550 and US 41 / M @-@ 28 . According to the permit application , the road was also to improve access to the forest lands in the area used by timber companies for logging , and it was to provide enhanced recreational access to remote areas of Marquette County . The private interests involved planned to build and maintain Woodland Road to state and county road standards at no cost to the county road commission . 
 By March 2010 the project had encountered permit issues . The US Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) had asked the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment ( DNRE ) to deny the necessary wetlands mitigations permits and to reconsider " alternative transportation routes that utilize existing main roads " . The US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the US Army Corps of Engineers ( CoE ) were also critical of the project . Based on the actions by the EPA , if the DNRE did not deny the permits , and EPA objections were not resolved , the project would require clearance through the CoE under the Clean Water Act . Local citizens ' groups joined the federal agencies in criticizing the road . 
 In the face of the federal agency opposition , the consortium withdrew their permit applications in May 2010 . The businesses involved indicated at the time that they would revise their proposals and reapply . Local government leaders supported the road as a means to support economic activity and reduce truck traffic through populated areas in the county . 
 = = = County involvement = = = 
 The MCRC became involved with the roadway , which they gave the CR 595 designation , in October 2010 . The commission approved a resolution to authorize planning of an all @-@ weather , 22 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 35 km ) road . Members of the public present for the meeting expressed opposition to the project that would have been funded by Kennecott Minerals . The company provided assurances to the county that they would pay the $ 50- to 80 @-@ million cost to plan and construct CR 595 . The director of the DNRE said that the department was weighing the options between environmental impacts of the road and impacts of mine truck traffic using the previously approved route through Marquette , Negaunee and Ishpeming . 
 Kennecott removed its support for the project during January 2011 . In a statement , the company said that the timeline for the permit process was uncertain , and they considered their currently permitted route to the best option . This move angered city officials in Marquette because it meant a return to trucking ore through the city along CR 550 , Sugarloaf Avenue and Wright Street . MCRC officials had stated that " we 're going to push it as hard and as fast as we can " , according to the board chairman . After the company backed away , local officials protested Kennecott 's return to its previously approved trucking route between the mine and the mill . 
 Within a month however , the company reinstated support for the project after the MCRC asked Kennecott to reconsider . The company held a series of public forums starting in April 2011 about their operations , including transportation plans , and the road commission did the same that August . 
 = = = Moving forward with the permit process = = = 
 In September 2011 , the MCRC voted to move forward with a modified routing to CR 595 ; the new route was to pass to the west of <unk> Lake instead of the east to address concerns from the public . The new route decreased the length by 1 @.@ 3 miles ( 2 @.@ 1 km ) while adding another creek crossing . The EPA and local environmental groups opposed the road , while Humboldt Township officials supported it . 
 As part of the permitting process the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) held public hearings in 2012 about the CR 595 project . In drafting its application , the MCRC said that the purpose of the project is : 
 To construct a primary county north – south road that 
 connects and improves emergency , commercial , industrial and recreational access to a somewhat isolated but key industrial and recreational area in northwest Marquette County to US 41 ; and 
 reduces truck travel from this area through Marquette County population centers . 
 Hearings were held by the DEQ on February 15 , 2012 , and a decision at the state level was due by June 15 , 2012 . The EPA was to make its decision on the federal level based on input from the USFWS , the DEQ and the CoE ; the CoE , USFWS and EPA all submitted comments that were extremely critical of the CR 595 proposal . EPA had recommended that the road commission re @-@ examine two alternative routings ; one would add a crossing of the Yellow Dog River immediately downstream of Pinnacle Falls , which the MCRC said would entail high construction costs . The second alignment would increase the length of the road by 19 @.@ 9 miles ( 32 @.@ 0 km ) . In May 2012 the EPA filed a formal objection to the project which gave the MCRC until July 22 to address its concerns . Until the objection could be cleared , the DEQ could only issue a state @-@ level permit for the project which would then require federal approval from the CoE , similar to the situation encountered by the Woodland Road proposal in 2010 . The DNR expressed concerns over the potential for vehicle – wildlife accidents but also that these concerns could be minimized . The department expressed a willingness to work with the MCRC to address these concerns through consultations over several recommendations . 
 In related news , the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) announced a Transportation Economic Development Fund grant that would pay to reconstruct CR 601 , which connects M @-@ 95 with the Humboldt Mill , and Co . Rd . AAA . The grant money was being provided to the MCRC , with local matching funds provided by Kennecott , to upgrade the two roads to " all @-@ weather " status . Additional improvements were to include a left @-@ turn lane for southbound traffic turning onto CR 601 from M @-@ 95 and the flattening of a small hill on CR 601 . By the end of May 2012 , the DEQ had lodged an objection to the CR 595 permit application ; however , the MCRC was working to address it to receive the permits by the following July . 
 The county expected a permit decision the week of June 23 , 2012 . One of the opponents of both the mine and the road , the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community , drew criticism of their stance during a meeting of the Marquette County Commission on June 26 , 2012 , that was discussing the tribe 's plans to move its casino from Chocolay Township to the site of the former Marquette County Airport in Negaunee Township . On July 12 , it was announced that the deadline for a permit decision by the DEQ has been extended until October 1 , 2012 , with the permission of the MCRC ; state law allows a permit applicant to approve or request such extensions . The MCRC has stated that any funding for the project by Kennecott Minerals may be impacted if the permit process runs longer than the new time frame . While there was no formal contract , the company has said it would provide funding if permits are granted and work on the road is started before May 2013 . The EPA scheduled a public hearing on August 28 , 2012 , as part of a public comment period that ran through September 4 . The DEQ had asked the EPA to render a decision on its objections by October 1 .

 According to Jim Iwanicki , the engineer @-@ manager of the MCRC , and Gerald Corkin , a member of the County Commission , US Senator Carl Levin were willing to help local officials obtain the necessary EPA clearances . In addition , 28 of Michigan ’ s 38 state senators signed a letter to the EPA in support of the roadway . The MCRC staged an event on August 27 , 2012 , where several logging and aggregate trucks drove through the city of Marquette along the route currently used to connect between CR 550 and US 41 / M @-@ 28 . Bill Hennigan , one of the drivers from a local timber company , said , " we want people to understand there 's a lot of truck traffic through Marquette now coming from the northern part of the county going to various points , and once the mine starts , there 's going to be even more truck traffic going through Marquette . " Hennigan and Iwanicki both commented in the press to the fact that the current routes from the northern end of the county south to US 41 / M @-@ 28 involve passing through populated areas in Ishpeming , Negaunee or Marquette , and that the new road would provide a north – south corridor that was west of the Dead River . Officials were pushing the roadway as a multi @-@ purpose facility , aimed to benefit other businesses like logging , tourism , recreation as well as the mine . 
 At the EPA hearing on August 28 , 2012 , statements of support were read on behalf of US Senator Debbie Stabenow , US Representative Dan Benishek , Governor Rick Snyder , State Senator Tom Casperson , and State Rep. Matt <unk> . The Michigan departments of Agriculture and Rural Development , Natural Resources , and Transportation also sent letters of support for the road project , which is also supported by the Lake Superior Community Partnership ( <unk> ) , and the Central Upper Peninsula Planning & Development Regional Commission . The township supervisors for Michigamme and Powell townships expressed desire for minor routing changes . Michigamme Township wanted the southern terminus shifted away from Wolf Lake Road ( Co . Rd . FY ) and Powell Township wanted the roadway extended into Big Bay . Supporters speaking at the meeting cited the benefits to public safety , job creation , less pollution , and moving truck traffic out of populated areas . Opponents cited concerns over the ability of the MCRC to maintain the road based on its budgets , destruction of wetlands , and concerns related to Rio Tinto . An official with the National Wildlife Federation questioned why a road was needed instead of a rail line to haul materials in and out of the area . The EPA objection was primarily based on inadequate consideration of alternative routes and unacceptable impacts to aquatic resources ; they asked for more information on two alternatives . The Mulligan Plains East route that would run for 25 @.@ 9 miles ( 41 @.@ 7 km ) at a project cost of $ 126 million and the Red Road / Sleepy Hollow route that was 39 @.@ 9 miles ( 64 @.@ 2 km ) and $ 107 million . Both alternatives involved less wetland area ( 15 @.@ 7 or 18 @.@ 3 acres respectively vs. 24 @.@ 3 , that is , 6 @.@ 4 or 7 @.@ 4 hectares respectively vs. 9 @.@ 8 ) and fewer stream crossings , but each runs east of Silver Lake and crosses the Dead River . 
 At the time of the meeting , MCRC announced a plan to preserve additional wetlands as part of the McCormick Wilderness to expand its wetlands mitigation plan for the CR 595 project . The land measured 1 by 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 1 @.@ 6 km × 4 @.@ 0 km ) and would be called the " <unk> Creek Headwaters Wetland Preservation Area " . Conservation easements would limit development activities on the parcel owned by various timber companies . The new proposal would mean that 26 @.@ 6 acres ( 10 @.@ 8 ha ) of wetlands mitigation would be provided for every 1 acre ( 0 @.@ 40 ha ) of wetlands used to build the roadway . This compared to the 2 : 1 and 1 @.@ 5 : 1 ratios from the county road commission 's original plan . Compensation to the land owners would be provided by Rio Tinto if the plan was approved . The deadline was later extended to December 1 , 2012 , with assurances that Rio Tinto would still finance the road if construction started in the spring of 2013 ; the delay was to allow the EPA additional time to consider the comments from the public hearing in August . The DEQ had asked the EPA to withdraw its objections so that the project could be approved , reiterating the state 's support for the project . The backup plan was to upgrade CR 550 to " all @-@ weather status " if CR 595 is not approved ; currently weight restrictions are enacted each spring on that roadway . 
 CR 595 was even a topic of discussion as part of the 2012 US presidential election as a family member of Mitt Romney discussed the road at a campaign event in Marquette . The EPA dropped one of its two remaining objections to CR 595 on December 4 , 2012 . The agency no longer found fault with the MCRC 's methods for determining the route of the proposed road , but reaffirmed its objection to how the road commission 's plan would minimize impacts to wetlands and streams . The MCRC and DEQ had 30 days to modify plans for the road to account for the remaining objection , or the permitting process would restart under the review of the CoE . 
 = = = Cancellation = = = 
 The DEQ announced in a letter to the EPA and MCRC on January 3 , 2013 , that the department would not be issuing a permit for the project . The department supported the road plan , but said that the complexities of the EPA 's outstanding objection prevented the roadway from meeting the requirements of the Clean Water Act . After this action , authority to issue construction permits for the road transferred to the CoE in a new permit process . Iwanicki , the MCRC engineer @-@ manager , went on record in an interview with The Mining Journal to say that the EPA changed the requirements to satisfy the agency 's objections to the project throughout discussions in December 2012 . " The EPA moved the bar every time we got close . Throughout the whole process , it 's been an ever @-@ changing target " , he said . The last changes to the project were made on December 27 , 2012 , to comply with EPA objections , but the DEQ staff working on the permit were sent on vacation rather than continue to work on the project . In the wake of these developments , Kennecott Minerals transferred its financial support from the CR 595 project toward improving existing county roads in the area . The MCRC will not apply for a permit through the CoE , canceling the project instead . Mine trucks would instead use existing roads from the Big Bay area south to Marquette and west to Humboldt Township , including streets that pass through the campus of Northern Michigan University ( NMU ) . 
 Reaction to the decision included disappointment from various elected officials . Congressman Benishek faulted the EPA 's regulations for placing " too high a hurdle for this project " and for killing jobs in the area . Benishek also stated that he would fight for the project and investigate what can be done to move it forward . The congressman has requested a hearing on the matter as well . Marquette County Board Chair Deborah Pellow expressed interest in suing the EPA for its denial of the permits to build the road . The county board thanked the road commission in a letter of thanks , approved unanimously at their January 8 , 2013 , meeting . Casperson was also of the opinion that the EPA and other regulatory agencies had an " agenda " against projects related to the mine . 
 On the other side of the controversy , Catherine Parker said that the MCRC could not have done enough mitigation work to satisfy concerns over the road , and that she was " relieved that we can finally lay this issue to rest and direct our resources elsewhere , namely to improving existing roads . " Officials with the <unk> were also " gratified " by the decision , and called it a " victory for the integrity of the nation 's Clean Water Act " . Margaret Comfort , president of Save the Wild U.P. , was " relieved " about the decision , but expressed the sentiment that the fight over the road was not concluded yet . 
 = = = Revival = = = 
 Iwanicki authored a white paper in June 2013 on transportation and road needs in the county . Of the four stages of the proposal endorsed by local governments , the first is a resurrection of the CR 595 proposal . The paper carries the endorsements of Marquette County , the City of Marquette , Marquette Township . NMU also " strongly supports the construction of [ CR 595 ] . " The university is concerned with the levels of truck traffic between the Eagle Mine and the processing mill passing near its campus . State officials are supporting the collaboration between the local governments and NMU ; Casperson and State Rep. John Kivela received copies of the white paper , and Casperson 's office is looking for ways to provide funding in support of continued efforts to build CR 595 . The MCRC estimates that it will cost $ 500 @,@ 000 to move forward with a permit application through the CoE . Most of the needed environmental studies have already been completed , and they can " repurposed before they are out @-@ of @-@ date " . Since the cancellation of CR 595 in early 2013 , Rio Tinto has sold the Eagle Mine to Lundin Mining , and there are no funding guarantees for construction of CR 595 if the permitting process is resumed . The MCRC board voted in November 2013 to continue consideration of the project , over the recommendations of the county commission . 
 A truck hauling ore from the Eagle Mine down CR 550 tipped over on December 13 , 2014 , and was not removed from the roadway until the next day ; about 1 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 kg ) of ore was spilled in the accident . The roadway , called " a notoriously dangerous highway " by a local state representative , was the site of the first accident involving an ore hauler since the mine began production . The accident " created major delays for drivers " of up to two hours on the primary road between Big Bay and Marquette , which was upgraded and designated as part of a truck route into and through the City of Marquette to enable the mine 's ore to pass to the processing mill . The accident prompted additional renewed interest in building CR 595 . 
 In an interview with WLUC @-@ TV that aired on December 26 , 2014 , State Senator Casperson ( R @-@ Escanaba ) and State Representatives Kivela ( D @-@ Marquette ) , Scott <unk> ( D @-@ Calumet ) and Ed McBroom ( R @-@ Escanaba ) said that they had been discussing options to get the roadway built . The MCRC was expected to file suit against the EPA in January 2015 over the denied permits for the road . Opponents like the group Save the Wild UP are disappointed that the road commission is once again moving forward with the road . Just days later , the chair of the MCRC board said that there had been no decision on a lawsuit , although there are " possibilities " and interest in a suit . However , during its January 19 , 2015 regular meeting , the road commission board went into closed session with their attorneys and emerged with a resolution to sue , which the board unanimously voted to support . The board 's chairman , Dave Hall , said " [ the board ] believes strongly in how we feel about this road and the need for its existence . " Hall cited the December 2014 accident , and a second in early January 2015 , as factors prompting the MCRC to move forward with the lawsuit . The Marquette County Board of Commissioners has opposed the suit , citing issues related to the private funding of the suit , provocation of the EPA when permits related to the Eagle Mill are pending , and funding for the road if it is eventually built . In contrast , the Marquette County Townships Association , a group representing the townships in the county , has supported the suit while Lundin Mining is staying neutral . A local group called Stand UP formed to fund the costs of the lawsuit , soliciting donations from supporters of the road ; the group 's leaders include former chairman of the County Board of Commissioners and current Tilden Township Supervisor Deborah Pellow , Tony <unk> of the Upper Peninsula Construction Council in Escanaba , and retired banker Stu Bradley . 
 On July 8 , 2015 , the MCRC filed their lawsuit in the Marquette division of the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan . According to Deb Pellow , chairwoman of the Stand UP board of directors , a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request to the EPA resulted in the disclosure of documents that show that the EPA had pre @-@ determined its decision on the road before the permitting process had begun , The agency , according to Pellow , had told various environmental groups as well as " staff members for a California senator " that the road would not be allowed before the permit application had been submitted The state senator and state representatives for the Western and Central UP all repeated their bipartisan support for the lawsuit after it was filed , which is also supported by the <unk> .

 Prime7 is an Australian television network owned by Prime Media Group Limited , and an affiliate of the Seven Network . Prime Television launched on 17 March 1962 as CBN / CWN in Orange and Dubbo , New South Wales , and has since expanded to cover regional New South Wales , Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory . 
 Prime7 ( along with GWN7 national broadcast facilities are based in Canberra . Prime Media Group head office / administration is located in Pyrmont , Sydney . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Prime Television originally began as a group of separate stations and networks – Midstate Television in Orange , Dubbo and Griffith , RVN / AMV in Albury and Wagga Wagga , and <unk> / ECN in Tamworth and Taree . 
 CBN @-@ 8 Orange began on 17 March 1962 , followed by CWN @-@ 6 Dubbo on 1 December 1965 . The two stations were both licensed to Country Broadcasting Services ( also the owner of radio station <unk> in Orange ) . CWN was a full @-@ time relay of CBN — the first Australian television station to relay another . The two stations thus formed the country 's first regional television network . 
 At the same time , RVN @-@ 2 Wagga Wagga began on 19 June 1964 , and MTN @-@ 9 Griffith began on 15 December 1965 . The two stations merged in 1971 as the Riverina and North East Victoria Television Service Pty Ltd with the callsign RVN / AMV on air . 
 In northern New South Wales , NEN @-@ 9 Tamworth began transmission on 27 September 1965 , with a relay in Armidale ( NEN @-@ 1 , later NEN @-@ 10 ) on 15 July 1966 . ECN @-@ 8 Taree started on 27 May 1966 . At one stage , ECN @-@ 8 was tied <unk> @-@ 11 Coffs Harbour ( now owned by Southern Cross Broadcasting as Southern Cross Ten ) , however the two stations split . NEN later merged with ECN as NEN / ECN . 
 = = = Television 6 @-@ 8 @-@ 9 = = = 
 As a result of the financial difficulties that many independent stations faced , MTN @-@ 9 joined CWN @-@ 6 and CBN @-@ 8 to form Television 6 @-@ 8 @-@ 9 in 1973 . Relays were launched in Portland , Lithgow , Mudgee , Cobar , Kandos and Rylstone and Bathurst . In 1981 , 6 @-@ 8 @-@ 9 changed its name to Midstate Television . 
 Colour television was introduced at the same time as the rest of the country , on 1 March 1975 – one of the single most expensive processes undertaken by CBN to date . The station was a prominent broadcaster of local sporting events including Tennis and Rugby . In 1979 a documentary titled Goin ' Down The Road , about the 1978 National Rodeo Titles won the network a Logie award for an ' Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station ' . 
 Midstate produced a number of local programs , including the Weekend Report , Early Shift , Rural Roundup and Around the Schools . Since 1968 CBN was able to access the Postmaster General 's microwave link for national news and other major events . 
 = = = Aggregation = = = 
 Midstate Television was bought out by media magnate Paul Ramsay 's Ramcorp Ltd. in October 1987 . It was soon merged with Ramcorp 's other stations , RVN / AMV and NEN / ECN . In 1988 , Midstate Television was renamed Prime Television and began to show increased Seven Network programming in readiness for aggregation . 
 When aggregation took place , Prime began broadcasting to both southern New South Wales and northern Victoria . Transmission problems meant that aggregation in southern New South Wales took place in two stages – first the Australian Capital Territory and NSW south coast on 31 March 1989 , followed by Orange , Dubbo , and Wagga Wagga on 31 December 1989 . These changes led to the de @-@ merger of RVN @-@ AMV , with RVN becoming CBN @-@ 2 . 
 Griffith remained a one @-@ station market , however instead of taking programming from Prime in line with the network 's other stations , MTN @-@ 9 relayed programming mainly from WIN Television in southern New South Wales . A supplementary licence , AMN @-@ 31 , was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996 , providing a relay of Prime Television . Soon after the station was purchased by WIN Television , which undertook a number of minor changes – mainly changing the news service to WIN News , and using entirely WIN branding . AMN @-@ 31 remains a relay of Prime . Similarly , the Mildura licence area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria , albeit with a single station , STV @-@ 8 , later bought out by WIN Television in 1996 . In 1997 Prime was successful in bidding for a new licence for the area at a cost of $ 3 @.@ 2 million . PTV @-@ 31 began broadcasting the following year . 
 Although advertising revenue increased post @-@ aggregation , local programming declined as a result of the costs incurred by the network 's expansion – an estimated $ 45 million had been spent by Ramcorp during and in the lead @-@ up to aggregation . After losses of $ 50 million , it was not until 1993 that the renamed Prime Television Limited posted a profit . 
 Prime Television became the first commercial network in Australia to add a watermark to the networks broadcasts , starting in the early 90 's the first watermark consisted of the Prime text from the networks former circle logo , located on the top right of the screen . The watermark was updated once again in 2001 to coincide with Primes new logo , still at the top right of the screen . This lasted up until Prime Televisions relaunch to Prime7 in 2011 , the watermark is now seen at the bottom right of the screen , like all common watermarks . 
 In November 1996 , Prime 's parent company , Prime Television Limited , purchased the Golden West Network , a merged group of four stations in regional Western Australia ; <unk> @-@ 3 Bunbury , <unk> @-@ 8 Kalgoorlie , GTW @-@ 11 Geraldton and <unk> @-@ 9 Albany . Western Australia , similar to Griffith and Mildura , remained a one @-@ station commercial market until 1999 when GWN became a Seven Network affiliate , after WIN Television began transmission as an affiliate of both the Nine Network and Network Ten . 
 The network began to expand into New Zealand in 1997 , when a number of licences were purchased from United Christian Broadcasters for an estimated $ 3 @.@ 6 million . Prime Television New Zealand began broadcasting on 30 August 1998 , with a nightly local news program in both Waikato and Christchurch . Prime also expanded into Argentina with the purchase of the Canal 9 network . 
 = = = 2000s = = = 
 The renamed Argentine network Azul Televisión was sold for $ 108 million in early 2000 due to lower @-@ than @-@ expected performance . During the same year , Prime benefited greatly from its affiliation with the Seven Network throughout its carriage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney . The network 's relationship with Seven was further developed throughout the early 2000s , leading to the unsuccessful introduction of <unk> branding for Seven Network @-@ produced programs . 
 Local news bulletins for Newcastle , the Gold Coast , Canberra , and Wollongong were axed in 2001 due to falling ratings and the anticipated costs of the switch to digital television . This , and the closure of a number of news bulletins by Southern Cross Broadcasting , prompted the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate the adequacy of regional news services The ABA later mandated that stations broadcast a minimum level of local content , based on a points system – two points per minute for local news , and one point per minute for other local content , excluding paid advertisements . 
 Prime formed a partnership with the Nine Network ( affiliated in Australia to competitor WIN Television ) , giving its owner , PBL Media the option to purchase a 50 % share of Prime Television New Zealand in return for access to original programming , and cross @-@ promotion in PBL 's New Zealand magazine titles . Following this , Prime Television New Zealand began to take on branding and programming similar to that of the Nine Network . In November 2005 , Prime Television New Zealand was purchased by subscription television provider SKY Network Television for $ <unk> million , completed after approval by New Zealand 's Commerce Commission in February 2006 . 
 Mildura Digital Television , a digital @-@ only station in Mildura began transmissions in 2006 as a joint venture between Prime Television Limited and WIN Corporation . Section 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act allowed for the provision of a third station owned by either one or both existing networks . MDT is a direct relay of Ten Melbourne , albeit with local advertising . 
 Prime Television announced on 21 December 2009 that it would start broadcasting <unk> on 23 December 2009 .

 On 25 September 2010 , Prime began transmission of the new HD digital channel 7mate aimed at men 16 – 49 . The first program to be broadcast was the drawn 2010 AFL Grand Final . On 15 January 2011 , Prime Media Group reported that Prime and GWN were to rebrand as Prime7 and GWN7 respectively . The news bulletins has changed to Prime7 News and GWN7 News , during that , <unk> and <unk> dropped the " Prime " logo on the multichannels . Prime and GWN relaunched on 16 January 2011 at 6 : 00pm . 
 = = Programming = = 
 Prime 's programming schedule is almost identical to those of metropolitan counterparts ATN in Sydney and HSV in Melbourne , with some differences . Since the network 's inception it has featured a broad range of original local programming , currently including children 's program Possum 's Club with Madelaine Collignon and station mascot Prime Possum as well as community service segment Prime7 <unk> , a series of short updates listing local community events . 
 Prime 's overnight schedule also differs from the Seven Network feed , containing infomercials from <unk> Direct , Home Shopping , and a feed from pay television channel Expo . Past programming from Prime Television has been recognised nationally , with some local productions winning the Logie Award for ' Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Television Station ' . The network has won Logies for Goin ' Down The Road ( CBN @-@ 8 , 1979 ) , Naturally ( NEN @-@ 9 / ECN @-@ 8 , 1984 ) , Stranded ( Prime Television , 1993 ) , Rest in Peace ( Prime Television , 1994 ) , and No Time For <unk> ( Prime Television , 1996 ) .

 Prime broadcasts to southern New South Wales through stations based in Orange and Dubbo , northern New South Wales from stations in Tamworth and Taree , Victoria from its Albury @-@ Wodonga @-@ based station AMV , and Mildura via PTV . 
 = = Logos = = 
 Prime Television became a network in November 1988 , with a shared logo produced and used across the regional stations , featuring the word Prime Television above an outlined rectangle . Aggregation occurred across the network on 31 December 1989 , along with the introduction of a green logo featuring the word Prime with the letter i dotted with a globe . This logo was used across the network until 1991 , when a new gold logo was introduced . Following a decade in use , 2001 saw the launch of a new simplified yellow logo , with the removal of the circle . This logo has been used since , and was launched concurrently with a similarly design logo on the Golden West Network . Following the 2011 relaunch , a new logo was introduced which incorporates the Seven Network logo . 
 = Ontario Highway 407 = 
 Highway 407 ( pronounced " four @-@ oh @-@ seven " ) is a tolled 400 @-@ series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . Comprising a privately @-@ leased segment as well as a publicly @-@ owned segment , the route begins in Burlington and travels through the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) suburbs of Oakville , Mississauga , Brampton , Vaughan , Markham , Pickering and Whitby before ending in Oshawa . The segment between Burlington and Brougham in Pickering is leased to and operated by the 407 ETR Concession Company Limited and is officially known as the 407 Express Toll Route ( 407 ETR ) . It begins at the junction of the Queen Elizabeth Way ( QEW ) and Highway 403 in Burlington , and travels 107 @.@ 9 km ( 67 @.@ 0 mi ) across the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) to Brock Road in Pickering . East of Brock Road , the freeway continues east as Highway 407 East ( a provincially @-@ owned toll route ) for 21 @.@ 2 km ( 13 @.@ 2 mi ) to Harmony Road in Oshawa . Highway 407 is the first electronically @-@ operated toll highway opened in the world ; there are no toll booths along the length of the route . Distances are calculated automatically using transponders or licence plates , which are scanned at entrance and exit points . Major interchanges along the route include the QEW , Highway 403 , Highway 401 , Highway 410 , Highway 427 , Highway 400 , Highway 404 , and Highway 412 . 
 Highway 407 was planned in the late 1950s as a freeway bypassing the Toronto segment of Highway 401 , the busiest highway in the world . However , construction did not begin until 1987 . During the early 1990s , the provincial government proposed tolling the highway to alleviate a revenue shortfall . The central sections of Highway 407 opened 1997 . The remaining sections were built quickly over the following four years , with the final segment of opening in mid @-@ 2001 . Despite being included in the 400 @-@ series network , the Highway <unk> section is not considered part of the provincial highway network due to it now being privately operated . The route is operated privately under a 99 @-@ year lease agreement with the provincial government . The lease was sold in 1998 for approximately C $ 3 @.@ 1 billion to a consortium of Canadian and Spanish investors operating under the name 407 International Inc . The privatization of the Highway 407 ETR section has been the source of significant criticism , especially regarding the increases in tolls , plate denial , and false charges . In addition , the safety of segments constructed following the sale of the freeway has been called into question . Many have come to regard Highway 407 ETR as a luxury , as opposed to the bypass of Highway 401 it was originally conceived to be . 
 A 42 @-@ kilometre ( 26 mi ) provincially owned and tolled extension to the route , known as Highway 407 East ( 407E ) , is currently under construction through Pickering , Whitby , Oshawa , and Clarington . It opened to Harmony Road in Oshawa on June 20 , 2016 , including a tolled north – south link to Highway 401 known as Highway 412 . A further extension will push the highway east to Highway 35 / Highway 115 in Clarington by 2020 , with a second link to Highway 401 known as Highway 418 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 407 is a 129 @.@ 3 @-@ kilometre ( 80 @.@ 3 mi ) controlled @-@ access highway that encircles the GTA , passing through Burlington , Oakville , Mississauga , Brampton , Vaughan , Markham , Pickering , Whitby , and Oshawa as well as travelling immediately north of Toronto . Although the general public felt that tolling made the highway a luxury rather than its original purpose of relieving traffic on Highway 401 , Highway 407 ETR has had average daily trip counts of over 350 @,@ 000 vehicles in June 2014 . The 407 ETR is contractually responsible for maintaining high traffic levels as justification for increasing tolls , but conduct their own traffic studies . Despite increased usage , parallel roads that Highway 407 was intended to supplement continue to grow congested , forcing the MTO to revisit costly widening projects of Highway 401 and the QEW . 
 Highway 407 has been designed with aesthetics and environmental concerns in mind by featuring landscaped embankments , 79 storm drainage ponds , as well as a curb and gutter system . Unlike most other Ontario highways , it features concrete pavement as opposed to top @-@ coated asphalt . Because of this , the high @-@ mast lighting along the urban portions of the route feature fewer luminaires than asphalt @-@ surfaced freeways .

 Highway 407 begins in Burlington within Halton Region at the Freeman Interchange between Highway 403 and the QEW , from which it branches off northward . The six @-@ lane route passes under Brant Street , Upper Middle Road and Guelph Line ( Halton Regional Road 1 ) before it interchanges with Dundas Street ( Halton Regional Road 5 and former Highway 5 ) . It briefly enters greenspace as it curves gently to the northeast , avoiding the nearby Niagara Escarpment . The route is crossed by Walkers Line , east of which residential subdivisions line the south side and greenspace lines the north . At an interchange with Appleby Line ( Halton Regional Road 20 ) , the highway straightens and travels parallel to Dundas Street before passing over Bronte Creek and under the Canadian National Railway 's ( CN ) <unk> Subdivision . 
 East of Bronte Creek , Highway 407 enters an agricultural area , interspersed with woodlots . It enters Oakville at the Tremaine Road ( Halton Regional Road 22 ) overpass , then gradually swerves to the north as it encounters an interchange with Bronte Road ( Halton Regional Road 25 and former Highway 25 ) . The route crosses Sixteen Mile Creek just north of <unk> Conservation Area , then travels parallel to the creek for several kilometres . It swerves north after an interchange with Neyagawa Boulevard , near the hamlet of <unk> . After diverging from the creek , it curves northeast , parallel to and north of Burnhamthorpe Road , where it interchanges with Trafalgar Road ( Halton Regional Road 3 ) . Highway 407 then encounters Highway 403 at a large interchange where curves sharply to the northwest ; Highway 403 , meanwhile , curves from the southeast to the northeast . 
 Now travelling parallel to and immediately west of the Halton – Peel regional boundary and Oakville – Mississauga city boundary , the six @-@ lane Highway 407 progresses northwest alongside a power transmission corridor , with subdivisions to the east and greenspace to the west . The route continues as such northwest to Highway 401 , passing under Lower Base Line ( which continues east as Eglinton Avenue ) and interchanging at Britannia Road and Derry Road before crossing the Canadian Pacific Railway 's ( CP ) Galt Subdivision . At Highway 401 , the route makes a sharp curve to the northeast , while ramps weave across both freeway over several kilometres , interconnecting them . It enters Peel Region at the Winston Churchill Boulevard ( Peel Regional Road 19 ) overpass and follows another power transmission corridor just north of the Brampton – Mississauga boundary . 
 Highway 407 swerves east and encounters an interchange with Mississauga Road ( Peel Regional Road 1 ) just prior to crossing the Credit River and the Orangeville Brampton Railway , after which it enters the urban GTA . After passing interchanges with Mavis Road ( Peel Regional Road 18 ) and Hurontario Street ( Former Highway 10 ) , the route encounters Highway 410 at another sprawling interchange located over Etobicoke Creek . Over the next 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) , the route nudges northward into Brampton , interchanging with Dixie Road ( Peel Regional Road 4 ) and Bramalea Road , as well as a CN railway line , before crossing Steeles Avenue ( Peel Regional Road 15 ) . Highway 407 curves back to the northeast as it interchanges with Airport Road ( Peel Regional Road 7 ) and passes beneath another CN line , before encountering the final interchange in Peel Region at <unk> Drive . It crosses the West Humber River and former Highway 50 in Claireville Conservation Area before curving east into York Region . 
 = = = Vaughan – Pickering = = = 
 Immediately after crossing into Vaughan , Highway 407 encounters the first of three large interchanges with other 400 @-@ series highways in York Region . The Highway 427 interchange is a four @-@ level partial stack located just north of Steeles Avenue in Vaughan and adjacent to the 407 ETR Concession Company offices . The interchange features weaved ramps which connect to former Highway 27 , located just east . The route continues eastward , parallel and between Steeles Avenue and Highway 7 . It dives through the Humber River valley alongside a CN line and along the northern border of Thackeray Conservation Lands , passing beneath a CP line . After an interchange with Pine Valley Drive ( York Regional Road 57 ) , the route becomes sandwiched between the industrial lands of the Pine Valley Business Park and the Emery Creek Corporate Park . A partial interchange with Weston Road ( York Regional Road 56 ) lies just west of the large four @-@ level stack interchange with Highway 400 , the only of its kind in Ontario . An interchange with Jane Street ( York Regional Road 55 ) is interwoven into the east side of the Highway 400 interchange , below which the future Spadina Subway Extension will travel . 
 Still travelling alongside a power transmission corridor , Highway 407 crosses a complex rail wye which provides access to the CN freight yards to the north . After interchanging with Keele Street ( York Regional Road 6 ) , the route gently curves northward , passing under the CN Newmarket Subdivision , which carries the GO Transit Barrie Line and crossing the Don River . It curves back eastward as it interchanges with Dufferin Street ( York Regional Road 53 ) , travelling adjacent and south of Highway 7 . After interchanges with Bathurst Street ( York Regional Road 38 ) and Yonge Street ( York Regional Road 1 ) , the Vaughan – Markham boundary , Highway 407 crosses the CN Bala Subdivision , which carries the GO Transit Richmond Hill Line . After an interchange with Bayview Avenue ( York Regional Road 34 ) , the highway serves south . A partial interchange with Leslie Street ( York Regional Road 12 ) precedes the third and final large freeway – freeway junction at Highway 404 . 
 East of Highway 404 , the freeway travels generally parallel to the Rouge River . It interchanges with Woodbine Avenue ( York Regional Road 8 ) and Warden Avenue ( York Regional Road 65 ) , east of which the route travels alongside a CN line and crosses the GO Transit Unionville Line . Highway 407 continues straight eastward into a residential area , interchanging with Kennedy Road ( York Regional Road 3 ) , McCowan Road ( York Regional Road 67 ) and Markham Road ( York Regional Road 68 ) where it crosses the river and diverges from both the CN line and power transmission corridor . The route interchanges with Ninth Line ( York Regional Road 69 ) and Donald Cousens Parkway ( York Regional Road 48 ) before exiting the urban GTA and curving northeast over a CP line and into Rouge Park . 
 Until the opening of the first phase of 407E in June 2016 , the final interchange along Highway 407 was with York – Durham Line ( York / Durham Regional Road 30 ) , the boundary between York Region and Durham Region as well as Markham and Pickering . The route curves eastward then crosses West <unk> Creek north of the community of <unk> and south of the future Pickering Airport and planned community of Seaton . Sandwiched between farm fields , the highway is crossed by North Road , where a future interchange is planned , and Sideline 24 . Highway 407 ended just south of Brougham at a signalized intersection with Brock Road ( Durham Regional Road 1 ) until the end of 2015 , where it continued eastward as Highway 7 . A new interchange has been built in conjunction with the provincially maintained and tolled extension , Highway 407E , which was constructed east of this point , and ties in with the current freeway , eliminating the at @-@ grade intersection . 
 = = = Pickering – Oshawa = = = 
 Immediately east of Brock Road , this tollway falls under the ownership of the Province of Ontario and is now referred to as Ontario Highway 407 ( Or Highway 407 East ) instead of 407 ETR . This route runs parallel both Highway 7 and Durham Regional Road 3 ( with some crossovers ) through the North of Pickering , Whitby , and Oshawa , until its eastern terminus at Harmony Road . A major interchange of this route includes with Highway 412 , which is a spur connecting the 407 with Highway 401 in Whitby . Both the 407 East Extension and Highway 412 opened to traffic on June 20 , 2016 , with tolls waived off until the end of 2016 . This highway will be further extended eastward through Clarington .

 Unlike most other toll highways , Highway 407 features no toll booths . Rather , a system of cameras and transponders allows for automatic toll collection . It is one of the earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use open road tolling . Highway 407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway ; interchanges connect directly to surface streets . A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway , calculating the toll rate . For vehicles without a transponder , an automatic number plate recognition system is used . In both cases , monthly statements are mailed to users . The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries . Toll rates are set by both the 407 ETR and the Province of Ontario for each of the respective sections they own . However , the province set out limitations in the 407 ETR lease contract for maintaining traffic volumes to justify toll rates . Despite this , rates have increased annually against the requests of the provincial government , resulting in several court battles and the general public regarding the route as a luxury . 
 = = = Plate denial = = = 
 As part of the contractual agreement with the government , the MTO is required to deny licence plate validation stickers to drivers who have an outstanding 407 ETR bill over 125 days past due . This process was temporarily halted in February 2000 due to numerous false billing claims . Following a judicial decision by the Ontario Divisional Court on November 7 , 2005 , the Ontario Registrar of Motor Vehicles was ordered to begin denying the validation or issue of Canadian license plates and vehicle permits for 407 ETR users who have failed to pay owed fees . On November 22 , 2005 , the MTO announced that it would appeal the decision but would begin to deny plates until the appeal was decided . On February 24 , 2006 , the Ontario Court of Appeals denied the government leave to appeal the 2005 decision . As a result , plate denial remains in place .

 All dollar amounts listed are Canadian dollars . 
 As of February 1 , 2016 , the base tolls for driving on the 407 ETR are as follows : 
 The toll rate that applies to a specific trip is determined by the time at which a vehicle enters the highway . 
 Off peak rates are in effect from 19 : 00 - 06 : 00 Monday to Friday except public holidays , and 19 : 00 - 11 : 00 Saturday , Sunday and holidays . 
 Midday weekday rates are in effect from 10 : 00 - 15 : 00 , Mondays to Fridays except for holidays . 
 Midday weekend / holiday rates are in effect from 11 : 00 - 19 : 00 , Saturday , Sunday and holidays . 
 Peak period rates are in effect from 06 : 00 - 07 : 00 , 09 : 00 - 10 : 00 , 15 : 00 - 16 : 00 and from 18 : 00 - 19 : 00 , Monday to Friday except for public holidays . 
 Peak hours rates are in effect from 07 : 00 - 09 : 00 and from 16 : 00 - 18 : 00 , Mondays to Fridays except for public holidays . 
 The light zone lies between Highway 401 and Highway 427 as well as section east of Highway 404 . All other sections lie within the regular zone . 
 Heavy goods vehicles and lorries are assessed a minimum toll regardless of the length of their trip . 
 * Light goods vehicles without transponders are assessed an additional Video Toll . Motorcycles are not charged a video toll because there is rarely a reasonable place to mount a transponder . 
 * * Heavy duty vehicles are legally required to have transponders in order to use the highway ; offenders may be penalised under the Highway Traffic Act .

 Upon opening of the new freeways in June 2016 , no tolls were initially set in place . However as of 2017 , the following tolls will come into effect for motorist utilizing the Highway 407E , 412 , and 418 tollways : 
 All end times displayed are rounded up to the nearest minute for simplicity purposes ( i.e. 6am is actually 5 : 59 : <unk> ) 
 The toll rate that applies to a specific trip is determined by the time at which a vehicle enters the highway . 
 Users of both 407 ETR and Highways 407E / 412 / 418 will only receive one bill invoice , with trips on each highway specified . 
 407 ETR Transponders will be compatible with Highways 407E , 412 , and 418 . 
 As seen above , the costs of utilizing these provincially owned tollways are less than that of the 407 ETR . 
 Light vehicles without transponders may be assessed an additional Video Toll . 
 Vehicles weighing over 5 @,@ 000 kilograms are divided into two categories : Heavy Single Units and Heavy Multiple Units . Heavy Multiple Unit Vehicles will be charged two or three time the passenger rate , depending on the size of the vehicle . 
 All Heavy Unit vehicles are legally required to have transponders in order to use the highway ; offenders may be penalized under the Highway Traffic Act .

 Although construction of Highway 407 did not begin until 1987 , planning for the bypass of Highway 401 north of Toronto began in the late @-@ 1950s . Concepts for the new " dual highway " first appeared in the 1959 plan for Metropolitan Toronto . Land adjacent to several hydro corridors was acquired for the future freeway in the 1960s , but sat vacant as the Ontario Department of Highway ( predecessor to the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) opted instead to widen Highway 401 to a twelve @-@ lane collector @-@ express system . The Highway 401 expansion project was considered a success and construction of Highway 407 was shelved for almost thirty years . The plan was <unk> in the mid @-@ 1980s as congestion in Toronto pushed roads beyond capacity . In 1986 , Premier David Peterson was given a helicopter tour of the city during rush @-@ hour ; construction of the highway was announced soon thereafter , and began in 1987 . 
 The Ontario government 's normal process for highway construction was not possible given the financial constraints of the recession of the early 1990s . The Peterson government sought out private sector partnerships and acquired innovative electronic tolling technology . Two firms bid on the project , with the Canadian Highways International Corporation being selected as the operator of the highway . Financing for the highway was to be paid by user tolls lasting 35 years , after which it would return to the provincial system as a toll @-@ free 400 @-@ series highway . The succeeding government of Bob Rae announced on March 31 , 1995 , that the corridor reserved for Highway 403 between Burlington and Oakville would instead be built as a western extension of Highway 407 . 
 The first segment of Highway 407 , between Highway 410 and Highway 404 , was ceremoniously opened to traffic on June 7 , 1997 ; no tolls were charged for a month to allow motorists to test @-@ drive the freeway . Several other sections were well underway at this point . A 13 @-@ kilometre ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) extension westwards to Highway 401 was opened just months later on December 13 , 1997 . That section was connected with Highway 403 to the south on September 4 , 1998 , with a temporary two lane ramp connecting to Trafalgar Road . In the east , an extension to Markham Road , at what was then the southern terminus of Highway 48 , was completed in early 1998 . However , due to the protest of local residents and officials concerning traffic spill @-@ off ( a scenario revisited with the extension to Oshawa ) , the freeway was opened only as far as McCowan Road on February 18 . The short segment from McCowan Road to Markham Road remained closed for over a year , as locals feared the funneling of traffic onto Main Street , which is named Markham Road south of the freeway . Both Markham and McCowan were widened to four lanes between Highway 407 and Steeles Avenue at this time . This did not alleviate concerns , but on June 24 , 1999 , the extension opened to continued protest regardless .

 When Mike Harris was elected Premier in 1995 on his platform of the Common Sense Revolution , the Ontario government faced a $ 11 billion annual deficit and a $ 100 billion debt . Seeking to balance the books , a number of publicly owned services were privatized over the following years . Although initially spared , Highway 407 was sold quickly in the year leading up to the 1999 provincial elections . The highway was leased to a conglomerate of private companies for $ 3 @.@ 1 billion . The route was subsequently renamed the 407 ETR . The Ontario corporation , known as 407 International Inc . , is jointly owned by the Spanish multinational Cintra Infraestructuras ( 43 @.@ 23 % ) , as well as various subsidiaries of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ( 40 % ) and the Montreal @-@ based engineering firm SNC @-@ Lavalin ( 16 @.@ 77 % ) . The deal included a 99 @-@ year lease agreement with unlimited control over the highway and its tolls , dependent on traffic volume ; however , the government maintains the right to build a transport system within the highway right @-@ of @-@ way . 
 When purchased , the highway travelled from the junction of Highway 403 in Mississauga to Markham Road in Markham . Extensions westward to the QEW and eastward to Highway 7 and Brock Road in Pickering were constructed by the corporation , as mandated in the lease agreement . The western extension , from Highway 403 southwest to the QEW , was not part of the original Highway 407 concept in 1987 ; rather , the corridor was originally intended to connect the Hamilton and Mississauga sections of Highway 403 . Highway 407 was originally slated to assume the temporary routing for Highway 403 along the Mississauga @-@ Oakville boundary to end at the QEW . However , the Bob Rae led Ontario government altered these plans in 1995 , and the corporation constructed this section quickly upon obtaining the lease . Sections opened throughout the middle of 2001 : between Neyagawa Boulevard and Highway 403 on June 17 ; between Bronte Road and Neyagawa Boulevard on June 29 ; between Dundas Street and Bronte Road on July 18 ; and between the Freeman Interchange and Dundas Street on July 30 . In the east , a final extension between Markham Road and Highway 7 opened a month later on August 30 . 
 On October 5 , 2010 , the Canadian Pension Plan announced that an agreement was reached with the owners of the roadway to purchase 10 % stake for $ 894 million . This implies a value of close to $ 9 billion for the highway in its current state . However , in 1998 , MPP E.J. Douglas Rollins found that as much as $ 104 billion had been spent by the province to that point . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 Highway 407 ETR has been the subject of several controversies over its two decades of existence . While the privatization of the route and toll rate increases have been routinely criticized by the general public and politicians , cost @-@ savings measures and the ensuing safety concerns resulted in an independent Ontario Provincial Police investigation shortly before the opening of the freeway . Finally , the public has accused the 407 ETR of predatory billing practices , including false billing and continued plate denial after bankruptcy . 
 An expert panel of engineers released a report outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii and a lack of protective guardrail at sharp curves , in addition to the lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel . However , it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross @-@ over collisions , given that Highway 410 has a similar median . 
 The Ontario provincial government has quarrelled with 407 ETR over toll rates and customer service , but is largely tied down by the lease contract . On February 2 , 2004 , the government delivered notice to 407 ETR that they are considered to be in default of their contract because of 407 ETR 's decision to raise toll rates without first obtaining provincial clearance . The court 's initial decision sided with 407 ETR : on July 10 , 2004 , an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407 ETR has the ability to raise toll rates without first consulting the government . The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6 , 2005 ; however , a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13 , 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision . The government also faced off against 407 ETR in court regarding plate denial around this time . 
 = = 407 East Extension = = 
 A provincially owned 65 @-@ kilometre ( 40 mi ) long extension to the 407 ETR , known as Highway 407 East ( or 407E ) , is currently under development in two separate phases . Phase 1 was opened on June 20 , 2016 , consisting of a 22 @-@ kilometre ( 14 mi ) extension to Harmony Road in Oshawa , as well as the 10 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) Highway 412 . The extension is free of tolls until 2017 . Phase 2A will add a 9 @.@ 3 @-@ kilometre ( 5 @.@ 8 mi ) extension to Taunton Road and Highway 418 and is scheduled for completion in 2017 . Phase 2B will add a further 23 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 14 @.@ 5 mi ) , consisting of an east @-@ west extension from Taunton Road to Highway 35 and Highway 115 , as well as Highway 418 , the north @-@ south connector to Highway 401 ; Phase 2B is scheduled for completion in 2020 . 
 An environmental assessment ( EA ) to analyze the proposed extension was undertaken in the early 2000s . The assessment also included studies of the two north – south connectors . A preferred route was announced in June 2007 , and the EA was complete in June 2009 . On March 6 , 2007 , as part of the FLOW initiative , the Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario confirmed the extension of the 407 to Highway 35 and Highway 115 in Clarington , including the connector highways , with an announced completion date of 2013 . On January 27 , 2009 , the provincial government announced that the extension would be a tolled highway but owned by the province and with tolls set by the province . The announcement also indicated that the province expected to issue a Request for Proposals later in the year . The contract , which is valued at $ 1 @.@ 6 billion and includes construction and operation of the highway , was eventually awarded to the same consortium that owns 407 ETR . 
 On June 9 , 2010 , the MTO approved the extension as far east as Simcoe Street in Oshawa , announcing plans to phase construction of the extension . Local residents and politicians rejected the plan , as had happened with the section between McCowan Road and Markham Road . A motion was proposed in the Ontario Legislature to build the full extension in one project , but failed to pass . Instead , a compromise was issued on March 10 , 2011 : the first phase would extend Highway 407 to Harmony Road in Oshawa by 2015 , including Highway 412 ; the second phase would then complete the extension to Highway 35 / 115 by 2020 , including Highway 418 . This timeline was confirmed by Premier Dalton McGuinty on May 24 , 2012 , and construction began in the first quarter of 2013 . 
 In early December 2015 , it was announced that contractor delays would push the opening of the first phase from December 18 to the spring of 2016 . However the extension did not open until June 20 , 2016 , the first day of Summer 2016 .

 = 1960 North Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 1960 North Indian Ocean cyclone season featured two deadly tropical cyclones that killed approximately 20 @,@ 000 people collectively in East Pakistan ( present @-@ day Bangladesh ) . The Indian subcontinent divides the North Indian Ocean into two areas : the Bay of Bengal to the east and the Arabian Sea to the west . The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) , while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories . On average , five storms form in the North Indian Ocean every season with dual peaks in activity during May and November . Cyclones that occurred between 45 ° E and 100 ° E were included in seasonal records by the IMD . 
 Fifteen depressions developed during the 1960 season , with five becoming cyclonic storms . The majority of the activity took place in the Bay of Bengal , where eleven systems formed ; however , the season 's first storm formed over the Arabian Sea on May 10 . The storm produced hurricane @-@ force winds and attained a barometric air pressure of 974 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 77 inHg ) . The deadliest and most intense cyclone of the season was Severe Cyclonic Storm Ten , which killed 14 @,@ 174 in East Pakistan in early November . With peak winds estimated at 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) and a pressure of 966 @.@ 7 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 55 inHg ) , it struck just three weeks after the previous system devastated the same area . The storm produced a 6 @.@ 1 m ( 20 ft ) storm tide that swept 16 km ( 10 mi ) inland , submerging several small islands . The two storms left a combined 200 @,@ 000 – 300 @,@ 000 people homeless . These systems marked the start of an unusually active period of cyclones impacting East Pakistan , culminating ten years later with the 1970 Bhola cyclone , which killed between 300 @,@ 000 and 500 @,@ 000 people . During the 1960 season , several depressions impacted India with heavy rainfall . Collectively , these systems killed 167 people .

 On May 10 , an area of low pressure was identified over the Arabian Sea roughly 400 km ( 250 mi ) to the northwest of the Maldives . Moving northwestward , it gradually organized , becoming a depression during by the evening of May 12 . After turning more toward the west , the system continued to slowly deepen . On May 14 , the S.S. Kampala sailed into the system , encountering 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) winds and rough seas . Over the following two days , the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm , with gale @-@ force winds extending 150 km ( 90 mi ) from the center . During the overnight hours of May 16 through 17 , the S.S. <unk> sailed almost directly into the center of the cyclone , reporting a barometric pressure of 974 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 77 inHg ) and 9 @.@ 1 m ( 30 ft ) waves . Several other vessels , such as the S.S. Saudi and S.S. Exchequer , encountered the storm . Both ships reported hurricane @-@ force winds , and the latter endured seas as high as 15 @.@ 2 m ( 50 ft ) early on May 18 . Later that day , the storm weakened so rapidly the crew of the S.S. Exchequer were able to watch the pressure on their barometer actively rise . Continuing westward , the system degraded to a remnant low before dissipating on May 19 off the coast of Hadhramaut , Yemen . 
 As a developing cyclone , the system brought monsoon @-@ like moisture to much of the Maldives , Ceylon ( present @-@ day Sri Lanka ) , and southern India between May 14 and 17 . The heaviest rains fell on May 17 , with 190 mm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) recorded at Kochi , India , that day .

 On May 25 , an upper @-@ level low pressure system developed over the northern Bay of Bengal . The following day , a surface low formed in association with this feature . By May 27 , the low further consolidated into a depression while situated 285 km ( 175 mi ) south of Kolkata , India . Tracking northward , it intensified into a deep depression before making landfall on the Sundarbans region of West Bengal — near the border of East Pakistan — early on May 28 . Though it was classified a deep depression , stronger winds of up to 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) were reported from Sagar Island . Based on measurements from nearby stations , it is estimated that the system attained a minimum pressure of 988 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 18 inHg ) just as it moved ashore . Once inland , the system quickly weakened and accelerated northeastward . It later dissipated over Assam on May 30 . 
 The system produced torrential rains across eastern India and East Pakistan . In Cherrapunji , 540 mm ( 21 in ) of rain fell during a two @-@ day span , while many other areas recorded over 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . No rainfall data were available from West Bengal and Assam . Strong winds from the storm destroyed numerous homes in West Bengal , and at least seven people were killed .

 On June 29 , a trough , associated with an upper @-@ level low , extended over the northwestern Bay of Bengal . Following a drop in sea @-@ level pressure over the next day , a depression formed in this area . Moving slowly westward , the storm intensified into a deep depression early on July 2 . Shortly thereafter , the system made landfall near Angul , India , and accelerated toward the northwest . The system later dissipated on July 4 over Madhya Pradesh after being absorbed back into the trough that it developed from . 
 Widespread heavy rains accompanied the depression along portions of the coast from Orissa to West Bengal and as far inland as Madhya . Sagar Island recorded at least 360 mm ( 14 in ) of rain over the span of two days , while Vishakhapatnam received 300 mm ( 12 in ) in just one . As much as 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) of precipitation fell across Madhya Pradesh .

 On June 26 , a slow @-@ moving trough developed over Gujarat . By July 2 , the system developed into a shallow land depression while situated 80 km ( 50 mi ) north of Veraval . Winds in the area were measured up to 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) ; however , as the system moved offshore , winds quickly increased to 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Low pressures were recorded across the area , with a minimum of 990 @.@ 8 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 26 inHg ) measured in Dwarka . Becoming nearly stationary off the coast of Gujarat , the depression began to interact with an approaching monsoon . This interaction caused winds to increase , with two vessels reporting 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) winds during the late morning hours of July 4 . Later that day , the system began moving to the northwest and quickly weakened . It was last noted the following day as a dissipating low over the northeastern Arabian Sea . 
 Between July 2 and 4 , heavy rains amounting to more than 300 mm ( 12 in ) fell across much of the Saurashtra region of Gujarat . These rains triggered severe flooding that killed at least 35 people and left 6 @,@ 000 others homeless . At least 500 homes were destroyed in the region .

 On August 6 , a westward moving area of low pressure was identified over Burma . Initially an upper @-@ level system , it gradually propagated to the surface , becoming a depression on August 9 . Tracking west @-@ northwestward , the system crossed the Indian coastline later that day near Balasore , where a pressure of 996 @.@ 1 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 42 inHg ) was measured . Sustained winds reached just 30 km / h ( 15 mph ) . Once onshore , the depression degenerated into a remnant low on August 10 . The remnants continued northwestward , ultimately merging with a trough over Uttar Pradesh on August 12 . 
 The depression dropped heavy rains over parts of India between August 8 and August 14 . The highest totals were recorded on August 14 when 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) of rain fell in Jhansi . Significant flooding took place along the Ganges River as a result of the rains . Forty villages along the river near Fatehgarh were inundated . 
 = = = Deep Depression Six = = = 
 As the previous depression dissipated over India , a new circulation developed over the Bay of Bengal on August 12 . This system quickly became a depression . Moving slowly northwestward , it became a deep depression on August 14 before making landfall in the Sundarbans region . Winds up to 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) were reported in Sandheads . Once onshore , it turned westward and slowed while maintaining its intensity . The system finally weakened on August 18 as it resumed moving northwestward again , and two days later it dissipated over southeastern Rajasthan . 
 Large portions of India were affected by rains from the depression , with Orissa and Madhya receiving the heaviest rains . According to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , up to 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 40 in ) of rain fell across portions of Orissa . The tremendous precipitation triggered disastrous floods that killed at least 65 people . Continued rains over the next two weeks exacerbated the situation and by August 30 , an estimated 2 @.@ 5 million people were homeless . Most affected were areas around the Mahanadi River and its tributaries where flood waters reached 3 @.@ 7 m ( 12 ft ) in depth . At least 85 villages were reportedly destroyed . Orissa government officials described the disaster as " the worst in living memory . " Rail lines and roads were severely damaged across the state , hampering initial relief efforts . A total of 1 @.@ 87 million acres of crops were flooded and overall damage amounted to ₹ 112 million .

 On August 20 , a wave of low pressure formed over Burma . Moving westwards , this upper @-@ level system triggered the development of a surface low two days later over the Bay of Bengal . Turning northwestward , the low consolidated into a depression by August 24 before making landfall in the Sundarbans region later that day . Once onshore , the depression degenerated into a remnant low ; the remnants persisted until August 28 when they were absorbed into a trough over Rajasthan Pradesh . 
 Heavy rains affected much of Bihar , Madhya Pradesh , Punjab , and Uttar Pradesh . The highest daily precipitation total was measured in <unk> at 190 mm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) . These rains triggered severe flooding along the Beas , Ganges , Jamuna , and Sutlej rivers . Large areas of Uttar Pradesh were left submerged , and significant crop and property damage took place in Punjab . At least 55 people were killed in Punjab alone , and losses overall amounted to $ 9 @.@ 24 million ( 1960 USD ) .

 On September 22 , an area of low pressure was identified over the Andaman Sea . Tracking northwestward , the system consolidated into a depression two days later over the Bay of Bengal . During the evening of September 24 , it further strengthened to a deep depression , with winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . Early the next day it made landfall in Orissa between Balasore and Chandabali . Once onshore , the system slowed and turned northeastward . It later dissipated over Nepal on September 28 as it interacted with the Himalayas . 
 Heavy rains accompanying the depression affected much of Bihar , Orissa , and West Bengal . Many areas recorded more than 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) during a four @-@ day span ; the highest single @-@ day total was 270 mm ( 11 in ) in <unk> .

 In late September , a tropical storm developed over the South China Sea . Striking Vietnam , the storm slowly moved over Indochina , ultimately crossing 100 ° E and entering the basin on October 5 while over Thailand . After crossing southern Burma , the low moved northwestward over the Bay of Bengal and reorganized . Following a report of 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) winds from the S.S. <unk> on October 8 , the system was classified as a depression . Moving slowly northwestwards , the system further deepened into a cyclonic storm on October 9 . Several ships in the path of the storm recorded gale @-@ force winds , depicting its strengthening . Early on October 10 , it became a severe cyclonic storm and soon reached its peak intensity with winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) . Its central pressure at this time was estimated to be 986 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 12 inHg ) . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) estimated that the storm attained one @-@ minute sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) . Turning northeastward , the system made landfall between Barisal and <unk> in East Pakistan , with the eye passing directly over the islands of Bhola , Hatia , and <unk> . Once onshore , the system quickly weakened and ultimately dissipated over Assam early on October 12 . 
 Across coastal areas of East Pakistan , the storm wrought catastrophic damage . A 5 @.@ 8 m ( 19 ft ) tidal surge washed over the islands of Hatia , Sandwip , <unk> . Communications across the region were crippled , and it took six days for word of the scale of damage to reach officials . Entire villages were reportedly wiped out by the storm . Approximately 35 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed , most of which were thatched huts made of bamboo and mud . About 300 schools were also damaged . The worst damage took place on <unk> Island where 3 @,@ 500 people were killed . Roughly 95 percent of the island 's structure were destroyed , forcing residents to cling to trees for survival . Only two police officers survived and were able to inform government officials of the disaster . An estimated 6 @,@ 000 people perished while another 100 @,@ 000 were left homeless . Heavy rain accompanied the storm , with Cox 's Bazar reporting 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) . Relief efforts in the wake of the storm were hampered by the nation 's poor infrastructure and debris left behind . On October 18 , members of the East Pakistani military were deployed to the hardest hit areas to provide stable communication and clean drinking water .

 On October 26 , a trough formed over the south Andaman Sea and extended into the southern Bay of Bengal . By October 28 , the system consolidated into a depression as it moved northwestward . Steadily intensifying , several ships encountered the storms increasing winds as it moved northward in the Bay . On October 30 , it attained gale @-@ force winds and further became a severe cyclonic storm early the next morning . During the evening of October 31 , the IST Barisal recorded winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) , indicating that the system had acquired a core of hurricane @-@ force winds . The maximum winds of this system is unknown , though reports indicated that winds peaked between 150 and 215 km / h ( 90 and 135 mph ) . NOAA estimated that the storm peaked with one @-@ minute sustained winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) and a pressure of 966 @.@ 7 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 55 inHg ) . The storm soon made landfall with great intensity near <unk> , East Pakistan , just three weeks after the previous storm devastated the country . Once onshore , cold , dry air quickly wrapped around the backside of the cyclone . Within four hours of landfall , little rainfall was reported near the storm 's eye . The cyclone rapidly weakened and dissipated the following day over the <unk> Hills . 
 Striking East Pakistan as a powerful storm , the system produced a storm tide of 6 @.@ 1 m ( 20 ft ) that moved 16 km ( 10 mi ) inland , devastating many communities . A storm surge of 6 @.@ 7 m ( 22 ft ) was measured in <unk> . In addition to the surge , there was a series of tidal waves that followed the storm , causing additional damage . Offshore , these waves were estimated at 12 @.@ 2 m ( 40 ft ) ; though they significantly decreased before impacting land . <unk> and surrounding communities were regarded as the hardest hit , with most being submerged in 3 m ( 10 ft ) of water . The city 's port was largely destroyed , with almost every vessel washed ashore . Some were found 16 km ( 10 mi ) away and one even at another port . The storm 's intense winds , estimated as high as 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) on Sandwip Island , leveled buildings and scattered debris over large distances . Crops were flattened by the storm and in some instances had been " burnt " by the sheer force of the wind . A total of 14 @,@ 174 people perished in the storm while another 200 @,@ 000 were left homeless . Following the mass casualties from the two storms , the Government of Pakistan requested the assistance of former National Hurricane Center director , Gordon E. Dunn , to improve the warning system .

 = Action of 15 July 1798 = 
 The Action of 15 July 1798 was a minor naval battle of the French Revolutionary Wars , fought off the Spanish Mediterranean coast by the Royal Navy ship of the line HMS Lion under Captain Manley Dixon and a squadron of four Spanish Navy frigates under Commodore Don Felix O 'Neil . Lion was one of several ships sent into the Western Mediterranean by Vice @-@ Admiral Earl St Vincent , commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet based at the Tagus in Portugal during the late spring of 1798 . The Spanish squadron was a raiding force that had sailed from Cartagena in Murcia seven days earlier , and was intercepted while returning to its base after an unsuccessful cruise . Although together the Spanish vessels outweighed the British ship , individually they were weaker and Commodore O 'Neil failed to ensure that his <unk> were co @-@ ordinated . As a result , one of the frigates , Santa Dorotea , fell out of the line of battle and was attacked by Lion . 
 Despite ineffectual long @-@ range gunfire towards the British ship by the remainder of the Spanish squadron , the isolated Santa Dorotea was rapidly forced to surrender , O 'Neil eventually turning the other three frigates back towards Cartagena . Unopposed , Dixon was able to consolidate his prize and send it to St Vincent 's fleet off Cadiz , where it was subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy . Lion remained in the Mediterranean during the year , later participating in the blockades of Malta and Alexandria . The Spanish , their seaports carefully guarded by Royal Navy squadrons , launched no further expeditions into the Mediterranean during the year . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the start of 1798 , the Mediterranean Sea was entirely under the control of the French Navy and their allies , including Spain , which had switched sides in the French Revolutionary Wars in late 1796 at the Treaty of San Ildefonso . Denied access to deep water ports and adequate supplies , the Royal Navy fleet deployed in the Mediterranean under Vice @-@ Admiral Sir John Jervis was forced to withdraw to the nearest friendly fleet anchorage , at the mouth of the Tagus River in Portugal . Although forced to retreat , Jervis ' force was not defeated and on 14 February 1797 he achieved a victory over the Spanish Navy at the Battle of Cape St Vincent , capturing four Spanish ships of the line . A blockade of the Spanish Atlantic ports was instituted , especially Cadiz , the large southern fleet anchorage , and the Spanish did not again attempt to break out during the remainder of the year . 
 Early in 1798 , rumours reached Jervis , recently ennobled as Earl St Vincent , of a buildup of French forces around the Mediterranean seaport of Toulon under General Napoleon Bonaparte . Similar rumours had reached the Admiralty in London , and St Vincent therefore sent Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson and three ships of the line to observe French activity . Nelson arrived too late however , and the French fleet had already sailed , carrying over 30 @,@ 000 men into the Eastern Mediterranean . Nelson , joined by a fleet of ten ships sent by St Vincent under Captain Thomas Troubridge , pursued the French , but failed to learn of their destination before the French fleet captured Malta . Ten days later , Bonaparte sailed for Alexandria for the second stage of his operation and Nelson 's fleet unwittingly passed his during the night , the British beating the French to Egypt but sailing off again before Bonaparte arrived . 
 While Nelson was crossing the Mediterranean , St Vincent was taking advantage of the absence of enemy forces in the Western Mediterranean to deploy newly arrived warships to the region . One of these vessels was the 64 @-@ gun ship of the line HMS Lion , under the command of Captain Manley Dixon , who had been sent to St Vincent 's fleet early in the year as a replacement for one of Troubridge 's ships . Initially ordered to patrol the Spanish Mediterranean coast , Lion was cruising 97 miles ( 156 km ) southeast of Cartagena , a port in the Spanish Region of Murcia at 09 : 00 on 15 July when four sails were spotted to the southeast . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The four sails spotted by Lion 's lookout were a squadron of Spanish frigates that had departed Cartagena on 8 July for a brief and unsuccessful commerce raiding operation in the Western Mediterranean . Each ship carried 34 @-@ guns and a weight of shot of approximately 180 pounds ( 82 kg ) to Lion 's 678 pounds ( 308 kg ) . On sighting Lion , the Spanish ships formed a battle line , with Commodore Felix O 'Neil 's flagship Pomona under Captain Don Francis <unk> in the lead followed by Proserpine under Captain Don <unk> . Bial , Santa Dorotea under Captain Don Manuel Gerraro and Santa <unk> under Captain Don Deam . <unk> . Seeking to engage the strangers , Dixon bore up , halting his movement to ensure he held the weather gage . This would enable him to manoeuvre with the wind and attack the Spanish at the time of his choosing . Seizing the advantage , Dixon then bore down on the frigate squadron , which prepared to meet the attack . 
 One of the frigates , Santa Dorotea , had lost a topmast sometime earlier and as result was slower than the rest of the squadron . Falling behind the others , Gerraro soon found that his ship was in danger of being isolated by Lion , as Dixon steered for the rapidly opening gap between the Spanish ships . Recognising the danger , O 'Neil ordered the front three frigates to turn around and sail to the defence of Santa Dorotea , passing close by Lion and opening a heavy fire at 11 : 15 . Lion replied , and the Spanish frigates did not immediately turn back for a second pass , continuing ahead as Dixon closed with the straggling Santa Dorotea . In an effort to deter the ship of the line , Gerraro opened fire on Lion with his stern chasers , cannon situated in the frigate 's stern , which caused considerable damage to Dixon 's rigging . As Lion began to close the distance , O 'Neil 's ships returned , but the frigates passed Lion at extreme distance , their broadsides having no effect and again coming under fire themselves . 
 Eventually , Dixon succeeded in bringing his ship alongside the Spanish frigate and opened a heavy fire , to which Gerraro replied with his own broadside . The larger and more powerful British ship was able to rapidly inflict severe damage to the Santa Dorotea , and within minutes the mizenmast had fallen and the mainmast and rudder were severely battered . As Santa Dorotea veered off course , O 'Neil passed Lion for a third time , at an even greater distance than before , and once again his broadsides failed to have an effect and again he came under fire from the British vessel . His last attempt to save Santa Dorotea defeated , O 'Neil turned away and his ships raised all sail in the direction of Cartagena at 13 : 10 . Gerraro , his isolated ship trapped by Lion , which was slowly turning back towards the drifting frigate , raised the Union Flag upside down as a sign of surrender . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Santa Dorotea had suffered severe damage during the brief engagement , and had at least 20 men killed and 32 wounded from a crew of 371 . By contrast , Lion had lost just two men wounded in the exchange : a seaman lost a leg and a midshipman was shot in the shoulder . Although Lion 's rigging had been badly torn , there was no structural damage at all . Securing his prize , Dixon spent the next day conducting extensive repairs before sending Santa Dorotea to Earl St Vincent off Cadiz . The captured ship was purchased into the Royal Navy and served for several years as HMS Santa Dorotea , rated at 36 @-@ guns . The prize money generated by the sale of the captured ship and the stores aboard was paid out to the Dixon 's crew in October 1800 . Nearly five decades later the Admiralty recognised the action with the clasp " LION 15 JULY 1798 " attached to the Naval General Service Medal , awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847 . 
 Lion remained in the Western Mediterranean for the next two months , eventually joining with a squadron of four Portuguese ships of the line under the command of Tomás Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama , Marquess de Niza . In September , Niza 's squadron was ordered to join Nelson in his search for the French and sailed eastwards , but while passing to the north of Malta they encountered a large convoy of battered vessels under Captain Sir James Saumarez . These ships were seven British ships of the line and six captured French ships , all survivors of the Battle of the Nile , Nelson 's successful conclusion of the campaign fought at Aboukir Bay off Egypt on 1 August . The Anglo @-@ Portuguese squadron continued to Alexandria in October , briefly joining the blockade squadron there under Captain Sir Samuel Hood before returning to Malta in December as part of a new squadron formed off the island . Lion followed the Portuguese back to Malta in December . The Spanish did not launch another expedition from their Mediterranean ports during 1798 .

 = Seneb = 
 Seneb was a dwarf who served as a high @-@ ranking court official in the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt , circa 2520 BC . Seneb was a person of considerable importance and wealth who owned thousands of cattle , held twenty palaces and religious titles and was married to a high @-@ ranking priestess of average size with whom he had three children . His successful career and the lavishness of his burial arrangements are indicative of the acceptance given to dwarfs in ancient Egyptian society , whose texts advocated the acceptance and integration of those with physical and mental disabilities . 
 Seneb is depicted with his wife and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb , rediscovered in 1926 , that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art . It shows him sitting cross @-@ legged on a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full @-@ size person would ordinarily have been . The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry . It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with <unk> , a common form of dwarfism . Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life , such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office . 
 = = Discovery and location of Seneb 's tomb = = 
 Seneb was buried in a mastaba - a flat @-@ roofed brick tomb – located in the West Field of the Giza Necropolis near modern Cairo , where a large complex of ancient Egyptian royal tombs and mortuary structures was built , including the Great Pyramid . It was rediscovered by the German archaeologist Hermann Junker in 1926 . The tomb is situated close to that of another dwarf , <unk> , a high @-@ ranking royal courtier who may have been Seneb 's father . Its date was long uncertain but is now firmly attributed to the reign of Djedefre ( <unk> – 2520 BC ) . His wife 's name also appears in the nearby tomb of an official , Ankh @-@ ib , suggesting that the families of Seneb , <unk> and Ankh @-@ ib may have been related . Seneb was apparently buried with his wife , but no trace remains of the bodies , and the tomb was looted long ago , like most of the others at Giza . It was one of the first known attempts at building a ceiling dome over a square chamber , with the dome resting on jutting bricks at the corners of the room . 
 The rectangular interior of Seneb 's mastaba contained two cult niches with a false door and cavities containing stone chests . Three statues were found within the chests – the painted limestone sculpture of Seneb and his family and two other statues in wood and granite . The wooden one disintegrated when it was discovered but Junker recorded that it had been about 30 cm ( 12 in ) high and depicted Seneb standing with a walking @-@ staff in one hand and a sceptre in the other . The remnants of the wooden statue are now in the <unk> und <unk> @-@ Museum Hildesheim in Germany , in a very fragmentary state ; the outline of a curled wig can still be made out , as can the pose of the left arm , which was held forward at the elbow . Seneb 's 1 @.@ 5 ton sarcophagus is part of the collection of the Egyptian Museum of the University of Leipzig . 
 = = Sculpture of Seneb and his family = = 
 The limestone sculpture of Seneb and his family is part of the collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo . It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register . Seneb is depicted sitting cross @-@ legged on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe . His wife Senet sits alongside him , wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair , which can be glimpsed on her forehead . She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support . She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness . 
 Two of the couple 's children , one boy and one girl , stand below Seneb where the legs of an ordinary person would be . They are depicted nude with their index fingers placed in their mouths and a lock of hair falling on one side of their heads , indicating that they were below the age of puberty , when Egyptian children were given an " adult " haircut . Seneb and his son are shown with darker skin colouring than his wife and daughter . This was a standard artistic convention used to indicate gender and status , reflecting the fact that high @-@ ranking females would remain indoors and retain a light skin colour while males would gain a darker skin from the hot Egyptian sun . The names of three children are recorded , though the third child was not depicted on the sculpture - presumably for reasons of symmetry . They were named after Seneb 's royal masters ; his son was called Radjedef @-@ Ankh ( " May Radjedef live " ) , his eldest daughter was <unk> @-@ Khufu ( " Happy is Khufu " ) and his younger daughter was <unk> @-@ Radjedef ( " Companion of Radjedef " ) . They are depicted with normal proportions , suggesting that they did not inherit their father 's condition . 
 The sculpture 's roughly cubical arrangement cleverly ensures that the overall composition retains a harmonious equilibrium . It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the piece . By putting the children in the place of Seneb 's legs , the artist adds to the sense of symmetry . He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure , preserving an appearance of normality without disguising Seneb 's unusual physique . The family 's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed on either side of the children and on the horizontal face of the base . 
 Seneb 's dwarfism is depicted realistically in the sculpture . It portrays him with a large head but small arms and legs . This possibly indicates that he had <unk> , a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest @-@ growing parts of the body – particularly the femur and humerus , which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs . It also affects the head , producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge . An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms and legs . Seneb 's wife <unk> is portrayed far less realistically ; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high @-@ ranking Egyptian women . 
 = = Role and position = = 
 Seneb 's name means " healthy " – perhaps given by his mother as a wish for survival when he was a baby . Many Egyptians possessed similar names , not to denote an absence of disease but to convey a positive message of healthiness and vigour . 
 Dwarfism was not seen as a defect in ancient Egypt , unlike in many other cultures . Egyptian texts advised the acceptance of those with physical or mental disabilities , and there were even two dwarf gods , <unk> and Ptah . A number of dwarfs gained prestigious roles and were given lavish burials in proximity to their royal masters . Seneb 's career is documented on his false door and the plinths of his statues , which record twenty titles including " beloved of the lord [ king ] " , " overseer of weaving in the palace " , " overseer of dwarfs " ( presumably indicating that there were others in the palace ) , " overseer of the crew of the ks ship " ( referring to a ceremonial or cult boat ) , " overseer of the <unk> " ( possibly referring to animal @-@ tenders ) , and " keeper of the God 's seal of the Wn @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> boat " ( referring to a papyrus bark used in certain festivals ) . His titles suggest that he might have started his career as an official in charge of royal linen and possibly also pets , a role in which other dwarfs are known to have served , and subsequently gained higher @-@ ranking posts in charge of royal or cult boats . Alternatively , he could have been born into a high @-@ ranking family and was given roles appropriate to his birth rank . Seneb also carried out religious rites in his dual role as a priest . He was titled " Priest of Wadjet " , priest of " the large bull which is at the head of <unk> " and of the bull <unk> . He participated in the funeral services for the Pharaohs Khufu , the builder of the Great Pyramid , and his successor Djedefre ( Radjedef ) . His wife <unk> , a woman of normal stature , was likewise a priestess , serving the goddesses Hathor and Neith . 
 Seneb 's tomb reliefs and the false door of his tomb indicate his wealth and power . Seneb is described as the owner of several thousand cattle and is shown in various scenes of domestic life – being carried in a litter , sailing in a boat in the Nile Delta , or receiving his children . The false door shows Seneb carrying out the standard activities of a high @-@ ranking courtier such as inspecting his linen and cattle , receiving accounts and overseeing his retainers . He is shown wearing kilts and a priestly robe made of panther skin , and carrying symbols of his office such as a sceptre and staff . One relief shows him accompanied by two pet dogs , each captioned with a name . He is depicted using what were evidently custom @-@ made items of furniture , such as low stools and a specially adapted litter with a low back and large side @-@ panels to conceal his legs . 
 As with the sculpture , Seneb 's size required the creator of the reliefs to make some unusual artistic choices . The standard convention of depicting higher status through physical size was maintained by portraying Seneb as being larger than his retainers , although this was clearly the opposite of the situation that actually existed . On the other hand , he is still shown with the physical characteristics of a dwarf . Unusually for such a relief , his wife is not pictured alongside him but appears separately . This may have been done to avoid the complications that would have arisen from needing to depict the couple 's relative sizes realistically while still portraying Seneb as the larger party , as convention would have dictated . Seneb is also not shown carrying out typical male activities such as hunting , which was presumably impractical for someone of his stature , although one relief shows him pulling on papyrus reeds to guide his boat through the marshes of the Nile Delta .

 " Grief Counseling " is the fourth episode of the third season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's 32nd overall . The episode was written by co @-@ executive producer Jennifer Celotta and directed by Roger Nygard , making it Nygard 's only series credit . It first aired on NBC in the United States on October 12 , 2006 . 
 The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) is overcome with grief when he learns about the death of his former boss Ed Truck . Michael spends the rest of the day attempting grief counseling for the mostly grief @-@ lacking office . Meanwhile , in Stamford Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) and Karen Filippelli ( Rashida Jones ) embark on a quest for a particular brand of potato chips . 
 The outdoor scenes were filmed during the summer , although the cast had to pretend like it was in the middle of winter ; this included wearing coats . " Grief Counseling " earned a Nielsen rating of 4 @.@ 1 with an 11 percent share in the 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ old demographic and was watched by 8 @.@ 83 million viewers .

 Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) is informed by Jan Levenson ( Melora Hardin ) that his former boss Ed Truck has died . Kelly Kapoor ( Mindy Kaling ) and Phyllis Lapin ( Phyllis Smith ) console Michael after he breaks the news to a mostly unmoved staff . Later , Creed Bratton ( Creed Bratton ) tells Michael that Truck , heavily inebriated , was decapitated in a truck accident . Michael summons the staff to a primitive grief counseling session involving a collapsible Hoberman sphere ball , in which Michael tells members of the staff to give stories of deceased love ones . This leads to the staff telling stories about losing loved ones based on death scenes in movies ( Million Dollar Baby , The Lion King , and Weekend at Bernie 's ) with Ryan Howard ( B. J. Novak ) saying he would elaborate more on his story , but it would take about an hour and a half to do it . 
 Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) tells Michael death is a part of life , and uses an example of a bird that flew into a first @-@ floor window that morning .

 " Grief Counseling " was written by co @-@ executive producer Jennifer Celotta , and was directed by Roger Nygard , his only episode of The Office to date . In a later interview with Den of Geek , Nygard found that " television episodes are the domain of the writer @-@ producers . You are there to service their vision . The Office is fully scripted , but there 's always a little room to play when it 's warranted . The first cuts are around 45 minutes , so you often have to cut the episodes in half for air . " Though " Grief Counseling " broadcast before the fifth episode , " Initiation " , its filming took place after that episode due to the availability of shooting on Dwight 's fictional beet farm . 
 The episode 's plot involved the death of former boss Ed Truck , a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second season episode " The Carpet " . As part of the episode took place outdoors , the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather . Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that " we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes ... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm . For hours and hours . You would never know it by looking at us . Isn 't that crazy ? " Flannery also wrote , " I love this episode because it 's dark , for a comedy . This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter . " In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me ? , Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show , where she and Greg Daniels , normally a " very nice " person , disagreed on a story point to the extent that Daniels told her that if " you [ were ] going to resist what I 'm doing here , you can just go home . " Kaling briefly left the set before returning , with no further problems or repercussions noted . 
 Deleted scenes of the episode were released in the third season DVD . Such scenes included a coworker showing Jim photographs of her baby , Dwight telling everyone to delete their records of Ed Truck , Michael talking about a need for a grief counselor , Toby holding a grief counseling session for the office , and Roy telling Pam of the birth of a cousin 's twins .

 " Grief Counseling " first aired on October 12 , 2007 on NBC in the United States . It received a Nielsen rating of 4 @.@ 1 / 11 . This means that it was seen by 4 @.@ 1 % of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 11 % of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . The episode was viewed by 8 @.@ 83 million viewers and placed as the 24th most @-@ watched episode for the week in the 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ old demographic . 
 IGN columnist Brian Zoromski rated " Grief Counseling " 9 @.@ 5 / 10 , an indication of an " amazing " episode . Writing that the opening sequence " excellently set " the tone of the episode , he found a " ton of great moments " , such as Michael 's " totally awkward speeches on Ed Truck 's death " and his conversation with Dwight over a robot statue . Zoromski saved the most praise for Pam and her pranks , particularly her " completely ridiculous bird funeral ... It was all so brilliantly over @-@ the @-@ top it becomes clear that the Scranton office will continue to be enjoyable to watch , as Pam takes over the mocking of the office all on her own , to a hilarious extreme . " AOL TV 's Michael Sciannamea also lauded Pam and her pranks , especially highlighting her actions during the opening sequence and her song during the bird funeral . Sciannamea assumed that " she feels liberated from Roy ( and Jim , to some extent ) [ and ] is allowing her personality and sense of humor to come out even more . " He concluded that it was " another solid episode with Steve Carell at his best . " 
 Entertainment Weekly 's Abby West expressed praise for an episode that " restored balance and order to our favorite paper @-@ pushers while still nicely forwarding the storylines of TV 's plainest super @-@ non @-@ couple . " West was also pleased " to have Michael back to his usual insanity " , and wrote that Pam " was priceless tonight , from the spot @-@ on reaction shots to the movie @-@ plotlines @-@ as @-@ my @-@ pain gag she started to the almost @-@ believably tender eulogy she delivered for the singing , er , impressionist bird , complete with the most tricked @-@ out pencil @-@ case coffin you 've ever seen . " Television Without Pity graded the episode with a B – . Michael 's monologue about the five stages of grief has also been isolated for praise ; Michael Sciannamea called it " the best line of the night , " and in 2011 , IGN 's Cindy White selected it as one of the series ' best . 
 = Miniopterus zapfei = 
 Miniopterus zapfei is a fossil bat in the genus Miniopterus from the middle Miocene of France . First described in 2002 , it is known only from the site of La Grive M , where it occurs with another fossil Miniopterus species , the smaller and more common Miniopterus fossilis . M. zapfei is known from five mandibles ( lower jaws ) and an isolated fourth upper premolar ( P4 ) . The fourth lower premolar is more slender than in M. fossilis and the cingulum shelf surrounding the P4 is less well @-@ developed than in living Miniopterus . The length of the first lower molar is 1 @.@ 57 to 1 @.@ 60 mm . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Miniopterus zapfei was described by Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg in a 2002 paper on the ages and faunas of the fossil sites of La Grive @-@ Saint @-@ Alban in southeastern France . Mein and Ginsburg wrote that it was the second fossil Miniopterus species to be described , after Miniopterus fossilis from Slovakia , but did not mention Miniopterus <unk> from the Pliocene of Poland or Miniopterus tao from the Pleistocene of China . Another fossil species , Miniopterus rummeli , was described from the Miocene of Germany in 2003 . The specific name , zapfei , honors Helmuth <unk> , who described M. fossilis . Miniopterus also includes about 20 living species of small , insectivorous bats distributed in southern Eurasia , Africa , and Australia . Although the genus was historically placed in the family <unk> , it is now classified in its own family , <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 The known material ( <unk> ) of Miniopterus zapfei includes a mandible ( lower jaw ) with the fourth premolar ( p4 ) , first molar ( m1 ) , and second molar ( m2 ) ; a mandible with m1 ; a mandible with m1 and m2 ; a mandible with m2 and the third molar ( m3 ) ; a mandible without any teeth ; and an isolated fourth upper premolar ( P4 ) . Some of the mandibles also preserve the alveoli ( openings ) for teeth that have not been preserved . The dimensions of the p4 ( length and width ) are 1 @.@ 03 x 0 @.@ 88 mm ; m1 is 1 @.@ 57 to 1 @.@ 60 x 1 @.@ 01 to 1 @.@ 07 mm ; m2 is 1 @.@ 51 to 1 @.@ 64 x 0 @.@ 95 to 1 @.@ 05 mm ; the single m3 is 1 @.@ 41 mm long ; and the single P4 is 1 @.@ 38 x 1 @.@ 52 mm . In a well @-@ preserved mandible , the length from the alveolus for the first incisor to the end of m3 is 8 @.@ 80 mm and the depth of the mandible at m1 is 1 @.@ 50 mm . Miniopterus zapfei can be identified as a Miniopterus on the basis of the possession of three lower premolars ( designated p2 , p3 , and p4 , because the original first premolar has been lost ) ; a two @-@ rooted p3 ; and the <unk> molars , with the posterolophid ( a crest at the back of the molar ) behind the entoconid cusp . M. zapfei is about 30 % larger than M. fossilis and has a more slender p4 . Compared to living Miniopterus , the cingulum ( shelf ) that surrounds the P4 is less well @-@ developed and the parastyle crest is weaker .

 Miniopterus zapfei is known only from the site La Grive M in the village of Saint @-@ Alban @-@ de @-@ Roche , department of Isère , southeastern France . La Grive M is one of several fissure filling sites in the area , collectively known as La Grive @-@ Saint @-@ Alban , which have yielded rich fossil faunas . La Grive M is the reference locality for the MN zone MN 7 / 8 , about 13 to 11 million years ago . La Grive M is one of the older sites of La Grive , and Mein and Ginsburg proposed taking it as the reference locality for a separate zone MN 7 . M. zapfei is rare in La Grive M ; Miniopterus fossilis is much more common in the same site , and has also been found in La Grive L7 and other European localities ranging from MN 6 to MN 13 .

 Wank Week was a controversial season of television programming that was due to be broadcast in the United Kingdom by Channel 4 , expected to consist of a series of three documentary programmes about masturbation . However , plans to broadcast it in March 2007 came under public attack from senior television figures , and the planned broadcasts were pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel 's public service broadcasting credentials . While Wank Week itself was cancelled , the films it was meant to showcase may yet be broadcast by the channel at a later date . 
 = = Commissioning and programming = = 
 The season was commissioned by James Hindle , the channel 's factual entertainment commissioning editor , and announced in July 2006 . It was to consist of three films broadcast in the 11pm slot , headlined by a documentary on mass public masturbation . This kind of programming was not unprecedented : the Channel had previously screened a ' Penis Week ' , reportedly described by MacKenzie as a " success " in a Guardian article . He continued on the subject of Wank Week , " we feel this is exactly the type of provocative and mischievous programming that Channel 4 should be covering in the 11pm slot " In the United Kingdom , the 11pm slot is considered post @-@ watershed , defined by the regulator Ofcom in the Broadcasting Code as later than 9pm ( although transition to more adult material " must not be unduly abrupt at the watershed or after the time when children are particularly likely to be listening " according to section 1 @.@ 6 ) . This allows the broadcasting of more sexually explicit content . 
 The first show to be announced centred on a <unk> @-@ a @-@ thon held in Clerkenwell , London in August 2006 . This was a public mass masturbation event organised to raise money for the sexual health charity Marie Stopes International . A press release from Zig @-@ Zag , the independent production company behind the recording of the event , promised that the film would reveal " if the only things allowed to be stiff in Britain are upper lips " . The programme 's working title was Wank @-@ a @-@ thon . 
 A week later , plans for an as yet unnamed second documentary about compulsive male <unk> were announced , to be produced by the independent company Spun Gold . The film was to be an hour long and focus on men trying to cut down excessive masturbatory habits of up to twenty times a day , using methods developed in the United States . In September 2006 , the final film in the series was announced . Entitled Masturbation For Girls , it was also to be produced by Spun Gold , and focus on female masturbation . It was to feature the sex educationalist Dr Betty Dodson , although the format had yet not been finalised . It was reported after the postponement of their airing that the second and third films were to be entitled I Can 't Stop <unk> and Masturbation for Women respectively . 
 = = Controversy and cancellation = = 
 Wank Week was criticised in the prestigious James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the 2006 Edinburgh International Television Festival on 25 August , only a month after Channel 4 's initial announcement . Charles Allen , the outgoing Chief Executive of Channel 4 's commercial rival ITV , attacked Channel 4 for deterioration of output and adopting a " begging " approach to finances in the run @-@ up to terrestrial digital switchover ( requesting subsidies for public service output while pursuing a path of commercialism ) . Wank Week 's mention came as part of a critique of programming that Channel 4 was counting towards its " educational " content . Allen joked that he was expecting Wank Week to be included , " but that could be a hard one to pull off even for Channel 4 . " The pun was subsequently repeated in the press . 
 Criticisms of Wank Week were echoed later in 2006 by Sir Jeremy Isaacs , the first Chief Executive of Channel 4 , in an article for Prospect magazine . Isaacs argued that Channel 4 's increased commercialisation led to a targeting of the 16- to 34 @-@ year @-@ old audience , and the subsequent " obsession with adolescent transgression and sex " could be seen in programming such as Designer <unk> , The World 's Biggest Penis and Wank Week . 
 Although these public attacks led to reports of concern in Channel 4 management , postponement of Wank Week did not take place until early February 2007 , only a month before its planned screening . There had been a major racism controversy during January 's Celebrity Big Brother contest , and the launch of Wank Week raised the prospect of further embarrassment at a critical time : Ofcom was reviewing the channel 's finances ahead of the digital switchover , with the continued nature of Channel 4 's existence as a state @-@ owned but advertisement @-@ funded public service broadcaster at stake . Broadcast magazine reported that several senior figures at Channel 4 had felt uncomfortable about Wank Week , including deputy chairman David Puttnam and chairman Luke Johnson , although they had originally not intended to formally object . The atmosphere following the Celebrity Big Brother racism row was suggested to have influenced the decision . 
 According to the media section of The Guardian , the films commissioned for Wank Week are likely to be broadcast at a later date , but probably not as part of a dedicated season of programming , and certainly not under the Wank Week banner . Dan Wootton , senior reporter at Broadcast , criticised the decision , calling it " wimpy " . Contrasting it with the way that Channel 4 executives had been prepared to defend Celebrity Big Brother , he concluded they had acted hypocritically . 
 = New York State Route 360 = 
 New York State Route 360 ( NY 360 ) was an east – west state highway located in northwestern Monroe County , New York , in the United States . It extended for 4 @.@ 87 miles ( 7 @.@ 84 km ) through the town of Hamlin from an intersection with NY 272 at the Monroe – Orleans county line to a junction with NY 19 north of the hamlet of Hamlin . NY 360 intersected the former southern terminus of NY 215 1 @.@ 50 miles ( 2 @.@ 41 km ) east of the county line at its northern junction with Redman Road . Most of NY 360 passed through rural areas ; however , the easternmost portion of the route was located in a residential neighborhood that comprises the northernmost portion of the hamlet of Hamlin . 
 The highways that NY 360 followed were originally improved to state highway standards in the 1900s and 1910s and first designated as part of NY 18 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . By the following year , the NY 360 designation was assigned to what is now NY 18 between NY 272 and NY 19 . The alignments of NY 18 and NY 360 between those two routes were flipped c . 1933 . Ownership and maintenance of NY 360 was transferred from the state of New York to Monroe County on November 26 , 2007 , as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . NY 360 overlapped with four different county routes at various points along its routing until the route was officially deleted as a touring route in February 2012 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 360 began at an intersection with NY 272 at the Monroe – Orleans county line in the town of Hamlin . The route proceeded east on Morton Road , passing through a lightly populated area and crossing a pair of tributaries that feed into <unk> Creek . After 1 @.@ 50 miles ( 2 @.@ 41 km ) , Morton Road ended at an intersection with Redman Road . This junction was once the southern terminus of NY 215 ; however , it is now merely a junction between two county @-@ maintained routes . NY 360 turned south here to follow Redman Road for 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) before resuming its eastward progression on Church Road . 
 Like on Morton Road before it , the portion of Church Road that is part of NY 360 was sparsely populated , save for a portion of the road near its junction with Lake Road West Fork . Roughly halfway between Redman Road and Lake Road West Fork , NY 360 passed over Sandy Creek . At Lake Road West Fork , NY 360 veered southeast . As NY 360 continued along the roadway , the amount of development increased as the route approached of the hamlet of Hamlin . North of the hamlet 's center , NY 360 met NY 19 ( Lake Road East Fork ) at a Y @-@ shaped intersection . NY 360 ended here , and NY 19 continued southward into Hamlin as Lake Road .

 On September 20 , 1907 , the state of New York let a contract for a project to improve Church Road , the section of Redman Road north of Church Road , and the portion of Lake Road West Fork between Church Road and Lake Road to state highway standards . The project was completed by mid @-@ 1909 , and the highways , collectively inventoried as State Highway 286 ( SH 286 ) , were added to the state highway system on July 20 , 1909 . On June 8 , 1915 , the state awarded another contract to bring Morton Road up to state highway standards . Work on the road , internally designated as SH 1282 , was completed that year , allowing for the highway to be added to the state highway system on December 8 , 1915 . The first set of posted state routes in New York were assigned in 1924 ; however , no designations were assigned to either of the aforementioned highways at this time . 
 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , several of the routes assigned during the 1920s were renumbered or modified . At the same time , hundreds of state @-@ maintained highways that did not yet have a route number were assigned one . This included both SH 1282 and the section of SH 286 south of Morton Road as both became part of NY 18 , a highway that was extended eastward from Buffalo to Rochester as part of the renumbering . At the time , NY 18 entered the hamlet of Morton on Kenmore Road and followed Morton , Redman , and Church Roads and Lake Road West Fork into Hamlin , where it overlapped with NY 63 ( modern NY 19 ) south along Lake Road to rejoin its modern alignment at Hamlin Center Road . By the following year , NY 360 was assigned to what is now NY 18 between NY 272 and Lake Road ( then @-@ NY 63 ) in Hamlin . The alignments of NY 18 and NY 360 between Morton and Hamlin were flipped c . 1933 , placing both highways on their modern routings .

 In 2007 , ownership and maintenance of NY 360 was transferred from the state of New York to Monroe County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . A bill ( S4856 , 2007 ) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April 23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June 20 . The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August 28 . Under the terms of the act , it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law ; thus , the maintenance swap officially took place on November 26 , 2007 . 
 As a result of the change in maintenance , NY 360 became part of four unsigned county routes . On Morton Road , NY 360 was co @-@ designated as County Route 279 ( CR 279 ) . The portion on Redman Road was part of CR 236 , which extends from NY 31 west of Brockport to Cook Road near the Lake Ontario State Parkway . The section of NY 360 on Church Road overlapped with CR 277 . Finally , the part of NY 360 on Lake Road West Fork was concurrent with CR 234 , which extends north past NY 360 to Moscow Road ( CR 211 ) . All four overlaps were eliminated when the NY 360 designation was officially removed in February 2012 , and the NY 360 shields were removed by June of that year .

 Star Wars Headspace is an electronic music compilation album executively produced by Rick Rubin and Kevin Kusatsu . It compiles electronic dance tracks of acts including Claude VonStroke , Flying Lotus and Röyksopp . It featured sound effects and samples from the Star Wars films , but does not contain any sample of John Williams ' soundtrack for the series . Hollywood Records and American Recordings released Star Wars Headspace in digital forms on February 19 , 2016 and in physical forms on March 18 , to decent commercial performance , beginning at number one on the United States Billboard Dance / Electronic Albums chart and becoming the second various artists compilation to top the chart . However , it also garnered a mixed response from music critics , praise going towards its eccentric concept and criticism that it would likely only be enjoyed by fans of the film series . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Star Wars Headspace is a compilation album of electronic dance music featuring sound effects and samples from the Star Wars films . Musicians Rick Rubin and Kevin Kusatsu , who executively produced the album , gave the producers files of these sounds , but were also instructed by Lucasfilm to not sample any of John Williams ' score from the films . Flying Lotus , who said that he was proud of being a part of the project , felt that the concept made sense given that the sounds used in the Star Wars would be a precursor of what was yet to come in electronic music . Therefore , he felt " close " to the sounds he was using to reflect the universe of the films . 
 Critic Jonah Bromwich analyzed that the beginning half of Star Wars Headspace consists of the producers sampling from the movie while making music in their common style , making it feel like " obvious tribute material " . The first track , Kaskade 's " C @-@ <unk> 's Plight " , represents Star Wars ' humor and C @-@ 3PO 's melodramatic character aspect , featuring sounds of Wookiee 's roar and shots from a Blaster weapon . Rubin 's house remix of " Jabba Flow " , a composition by J.J. Abrams and Lin @-@ Manuel Miranda used in Star Wars : The Force Awakens , is the fifth track on the compilation , which is followed by Claude VonStroke 's " R2 Knows " , featuring vocals from Barry Drift and described in a review by Pitchfork Media as a silly anthem similar to releases from Todd Terje . Another track by Rubin , " NR @-@ G7 " , has many samples such as R2 @-@ D2 blips playing over a " driving " four on the floor instrumental with " dazzling jet @-@ stream " synthesizers . However , Bromwich also wrote that the later songs on the track list focus less on the artists making music in their typical trend and more on replicating what made John Williams score so great . Consequence of Sound 's Derek Staples noted Norwegian duo Röyksopp 's “ Bounty Hunters ” to be less of a bright song and more of a dark <unk> track than their usual material . " Sunset Over <unk> " by <unk> , a producer signed under the label <unk> , has a melody reminiscent of " Leia 's Theme " , and has a more " cinematic " atmosphere than his previous work . The record closes with " Star Tripper " by French producer Breakbot , a downtempo funk song featuring orchestration reflecting the neo @-@ romantic aspect of Williams ' soundtrack .

 On February 8 , 2016 , the release date and cover art of Star Wars Headspace was announced , and pre @-@ ordering of the record began . That same day , Beats 1 , an Apple Music radio show by New Zealand DJ and producer Zane Lowe , promoted the compilation with an interview with Flying Lotus about his involvement , as well as premiering three tracks , " Cantina Boys " , " NR @-@ G7 " and " R2 Where R U ?

Hollywood Records issued the album in digital form on February 19 , 2016 , followed by a physical release on March 18 . Selling 3 @,@ 000 copies in the United States on its first Billboard chart week , Star Wars Headspace topped the Dance / Electronic Albums chart , the first various artists compilation to do so on the chart since 2008 's High School Musical 2 : Non @-@ Stop Dance Party .

 Critical response to Star Wars Headspace was mixed , holding a weighted mean of a 48 out of 100 on the site Metacritic based on seven reviews . Drew <unk> reviewed it for One Thing I Love Today , his daily column on HitFix which is meant to highlight certain aspects of modern @-@ day popular culture . He honored the compilation 's concept of a EDM Star Wars tribute as funny : " I 'm not sure how long I 'll listen to it , because in the end , it 's still an hour or so of EDM , but it was a delightful soundtrack to a busy weekend , and all of the small surprises built into it should make it something that any Star Wars fan will be able to easily enjoy . " A correspondent for The Boston Globe wrote that it was much better than he expected it to be , giving all credit to the producers who contributed to the compilation . Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts spotlighted the distinguishing characteristic of each song . Bromwich , who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media , scored the release a 6 @.@ 9 out of ten , highlighting the record 's goal of just being " simple fun " and " Neither [ a ] stale tribute nor sloppy <unk> " . At the same time , however , he also disliked that the nostalgic style was seemingly " a way of avoiding risk " . 
 The album also garnered numerous mixed reviews that felt that it would only be enjoyed by fans of the franchise ; Staples described the tracks as " musical fan fiction ready for both celestial dance floors and distant forgotten landscapes " , while Jon Dolan , reviewing for Rolling Stone magazine , rated it two and a half stars out of five , feeling that many of the producers involved with the project didn 't experiment enough with the concept that it was " hard to get beyond timid fanboy reverence . " The harshest review came from Sam Goldner of Tiny Mix Tapes , who bashed the album as a major contributing factor to " the nasty details , the blemishes , the facts of this world that truly corrupt our collective sense of well @-@ being and hope " in regards to how the Star Wars franchise has been marketed .

 = Hugo von Pohl = 
 Hugo von Pohl ( 25 August 1855 – 23 February 1916 ) was a German admiral who served during the First World War . He joined the Navy in 1872 and served in various capacities , including with the new torpedo boats in the 1880s , and in the Reichsmarineamt ( Imperial Navy Office ) in the 1890s . He eventually reached the rank of Vizeadmiral and held the position of Chief of the Admiralty Staff in 1913 . He commanded the German High Seas Fleet from February 1915 until January 1916 . As the commander of the surface fleet , he was exceedingly cautious , and did not engage the High Seas Fleet in any actions with the British Grand Fleet . Pohl was an outspoken advocate of unrestricted submarine warfare , and he put the policy into effect once he took command of the fleet on 4 February 1915 . Seriously ill from liver cancer by January 1916 , Pohl was replaced by Reinhard Scheer that month . Pohl died a month later . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Hugo von Pohl was born in Breslau , Prussian Silesia , on 25 August 1855 . He entered the Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) as a cadet in April 1872 . At the age of 24 , Pohl was promoted and given command of the sailing corvette SMS Carola . In the 1880s , he served with then @-@ Korvettenkapitän Alfred von Tirpitz in his so @-@ called " Torpedo Gang " , which advocated a greater emphasis on torpedo boats in the German fleet . Pohl took command of the spar torpedo vessel Ulan , an early , experimental torpedo boat , in 1882 . Two years later , in late September 1884 , he was involved in an experiment with new torpedo boat designs from Schichau , Thornycroft , AG Vulcan , and AG Weser ; Pohl commanded one of the Schichau boats . During the exercises , Pohl 's boat collided with the boat commanded by August von Heeringen . The former 's boat sprung a leak , while the latter 's rudder was damaged , but both safely returned to port . 
 By the 1890s , Pohl had been transferred to the Reichsmarineamt ( Imperial Navy Office ) , where he would again work with Tirpitz after the latter was appointed as the State Secretary of the Navy . In 1900 , Pohl was assigned to the fleet that was sent to China to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion . While in China , he commanded the protected cruiser SMS Hansa , which bombarded the Taku Forts . In May of that year , Pohl was promoted to Korvettenkapitän . He was promoted to the rank of Konteradmiral in 1906 . Thereafter he served as the commander of the reconnaissance forces of the German fleet . Pohl was promoted again , to Vizeadmiral , in January 1913 . That year , he was elevated to the nobility and , in April , became the Chief of the Admiralty Staff , a position he would hold for two years . 
 As Chief of the Admiralty Staff , Pohl was involved in the German deliberations during the July Crisis in the aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian terrorists the previous month . Pohl , Helmuth von Moltke , the Chief of the German General Staff , and Theobald von Bethmann @-@ Hollweg , the Chancellor , met the Kaiser after the monarch returned from a cruise to Norway with the bulk of the High Seas Fleet . Pohl and the others were present at several meetings with the Kaiser , which ultimately produced the " blank check " Wilhelm II extended to Austria @-@ Hungary ; this decision ultimately helped to push Europe into the First World War by the end of the month . 
 = = = First World War = = = 
 At the outbreak of war , Pohl , along with Georg von Müller , the Chief of the Imperial Naval Cabinet , and Friedrich von Ingenohl , the commander of the High Seas Fleet , believed that since the war would be over quickly , the fleet should be preserved intact . Together , they agreed that the fleet should be restrained to provide local defense of the German coast , rather than seek a decisive battle against the numerically superior British Grand Fleet . Pohl argued that U @-@ boats should be used to attack British merchant shipping . He pushed for fewer restrictions on the conduct of the commerce war beginning in late 1914 ; he further advocated abandoning the cruiser rules that handicapped the German effort , in favor of unrestricted submarine warfare . He presented his first plans for an unlimited commerce war in November 1914 , but these were rejected by the Kaiser and Bethmann @-@ Hollweg so as not to antagonize neutral nations , in particular the United States . 
 After the Battle of Dogger Bank , Pohl replaced Ingenohl as commander of the High Seas Fleet ; throughout his tenure as its commander , Pohl adopted a very cautious strategy in order to preserve the strength of the fleet . Pohl was a controversial choice to replace Ingenohl , in large part owing to his caution with the employment of the surface fleet . Two days after taking command , on 4 February 1915 , Pohl gave the order to use unrestricted submarine warfare against the Allies ; he had managed to convince Bethmann @-@ Hollweg by falsely promising him that U @-@ boat commanders could distinguish between enemy and neutral steamers , and thus avoid provoking the United States . The policy was short @-@ lived , however , as on 7 May 1915 , the U @-@ boat U @-@ 20 torpedoed and sank the passenger liner RMS Lusitania , causing a diplomatic crisis with the United States . To avoid drawing America into the war , Germany reinstated restrictions on the U @-@ boat fleet . 
 Aboard his flagship , SMS Friedrich der Grosse , Pohl conducted a series of short operations into the North Sea over the course of 1915 . None of these operations ventured outside of the southern end of the North Sea , and the fleet never encountered any British forces . Pohl became seriously ill from liver cancer on 8 January 1916 and was taken to a hospital ship . He was subsequently moved to Berlin for surgery . He was relieved of command due to his poor health on 23 January ; his replacement as fleet commander was Reinhard Scheer . Pohl died a month later , on 23 February . Shortly before his death , he was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle with oak leaves and swords for his command of the fleet . In 1920 , Pohl 's widow Ella published some of his papers in an effort to defend his reputation from postwar criticisms . 
 = Unser Mund sei voll Lachens , BWV 110 = 
 Unser Mund sei voll Lachens ( May our mouth be full of laughter ) , BWV 110 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed the Christmas cantata in Leipzig for Christmas Day and first performed it on 25 December 1725 . 
 Bach composed the cantata in his third year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig . He used a text by Georg Christian Lehms , which was published already in 1711 . The text has no recitatives alternating with arias , but instead three biblical quotations , opening with verses from Psalm 26 , then a verse from the Book of Jeremiah about God 's greatness , and finally the angels ' song from the Nativity according to the Gospel of Luke . The closing chorale is taken from Caspar Füger 's " Wir Christenleut " . 
 Bach scored the work festively for four vocal soloists , a four @-@ part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of trumpets and timpani , transverse flutes , different kinds of oboe , strings and basso continuo including bassoon . He derived the first chorus , in the style of a French overture , from the overture to his fourth Orchestral Suite , embedding vocal parts in its fast middle section . The song of the angels is based on the Christmas interpolation Virga Jesse <unk> of his Magnificat in E @-@ flat major , BWV 243a . He chose obbligato instruments to differentiate the character of the three arias : two flutes with the tenor expressing the " lowly birth " , oboe d 'amore with the alto , representing God 's love , and trumpet , oboes and strings with the bass for his call to sing songs of joy together . Bach led the Thomanerchor in the first performances on Christmas Day , one in the Nikolaikirche and one in the Thomaskirche . 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach composed the cantata in his third year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig for Christmas Day , the first day of a Christmas celebration which lasted for three days . The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Epistle of Titus , " God 's mercy appeared " ( Titus 2 : 11 – 14 ) or from Isaiah , " Unto us a child is born " ( Isaiah 9 : 2 – 7 ) , and from the Gospel of Luke , the Nativity , Annunciation to the shepherds and the angels ' song ( Luke 2 : 1 – 14 ) . 
 In 1723 , his first year in Leipzig , Bach had composed no new cantata for Christmas Day , but revived Christen , ätzet diesen Tag , BWV 63 , on a text of free poetry without any biblical or chorale content . That year , he composed new works for the second and third feast day . In 1724 , his second year , he composed three chorale cantatas for the three feast days , beginning with Gelobet <unk> du , Jesu Christ , BWV 91 . In his third year , Bach used a cantata text by Georg Christian Lehms , which was published already in 1711 in Darmstadt in the collection Gottgefälliges Kirchen @-@ Opffer . The librettist began with a quotation of two verses from Psalm 126 which deals with the hope for delivery of Jerusalem , " When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion , we were like them that dream . " , and the joyful reaction ( Psalms 126 : 2 – 3 ) . The poet included for a recitative a verse from the Book of Jeremiah , praising God 's greatness ( Jeremiah 10 : 6 ) , and he quoted from the Christmas story in the Gospel of Luke the singing of the angels ( Luke 2 : 14 ) . In this early text , three biblical quotations alternate with arias . The closing chorale is the fifth stanza of Caspar Füger 's hymn " Wir Christenleut " . 
 Bach led the Thomanerchor in the first performance in the morning of Christmas Day in the Nikolaikirche , repeated in the afternoon in the Thomaskirche . He led at least one more performance between 1728 and 1731 . 
 Some Bach scholars believed that the cantata was written in 1734 for the end of the War of the Polish Succession , but the discovery of the printed text showed that it was not related . The cantata was not published until 1876 when it appeared in the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe , the first complete edition of the composer 's works . 
 = = Structure and scoring = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in seven movements . An opening chorus and a closing chorale frame a sequence of arias , a recitative and a duet . Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists ( soprano ( S ) , alto ( A ) , tenor ( T ) , bass ( B ) ) , a four @-@ part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani ( Ti ) , two transverse flutes ( Ft ) , three oboes ( Ob ) ( also oboe d 'amore and oboe da caccia ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , and basso continuo including bassoon . The heading of the original parts reads : " J.J. Feria 1 <unk> Xsti . <unk> a 3 Trombe , Tamburi . 3 Hautb . / <unk> . 2 Violini e Viola , 4 Voci è Continuo . " , which means " Jesus help . First feast day of the birth of Christ . Concerto for 3 trumpets , timpani , 3 oboes , bassoon , 2 violins and viola , 4 voices and continuo " . The duration is given as 27 minutes . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr , using the symbols for common time ( 4 / 4 ) and alla breve ( 2 / 2 ) . The continuo , playing throughout , is not shown . 
 = = Music = = 
 In 1725 , Bach typically composed alternating recitatives and arias in his cantatas , both on contemporary poetry . The text for this work is in an older style , with biblical texts interspersed with arias . Bach followed it , using different musical forms for the biblical quotations . The opening chorus on psalm verses is an adaptation of his overture to his fourth Orchestral Suite in D major , BWV 1069 . The duet " Ehre sei Gott in der <unk> " is based on the Christmas interpolation Virga Jesse floruit from Bach 's Magnificat in E @-@ flat major , BWV 243a , of 1723 , performed for his first Christmas in Leipzig . 
 = = = 1 = = = 
 The opening chorus is " Unser Mund sei voll Lachens " ( May our mouth be full of laughter ) . It calls for all instruments to perform . The text " concludes with acknowledgement that the Lord has achieved great things for his people " . Bach based the music on the overture to his fourth Orchestral Suite in D major , adding festive trumpets and timpani as well as flutes to the original music and embedding the voices . He followed the format of the French overture by instrumental slow sections framing the fast choral section . The French overture , normally played upon the arrival of the king to a performance , seemed suitable to greet the King of Heaven . The laughter mentioned in the text is " often made quite graphically audible " , as the Bach Scholar Alfred Dürr words it . When Bach performed the work again later , he marked some vocal sections as " ripieno " , achieving even more variety in the " concerto " . John Eliot Gardiner , who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage , interprets it as Bach 's vote against a strict one voice per part concept . He chose this cantata in one of three Christmas concerts to conclude the endeavour of a full year , and notes the first movement 's " marvellous rendition of laughter @-@ in @-@ music " and " innate elegance and lightness of touch " .

 The alto aria , " Ach Herr , was ist ein <unk> " ( Ah , Lord , what is a human being ) , is accompanied by a solo oboe d 'amore that " expresses wonder about the nature of man " and God 's interest in him . The aria , as the first one , is not a da capo aria , but in two parts . The idea of man in a sinful condition which is presented first , is changed to redemption . The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann relates the choice of the oboe d 'amore to the answer to the singer 's question " Why do you do all this for man ? " : " Aus Liebe " ( through love ) .

 The duet " Ehre sei Gott in der <unk> " ( Glory to God in the highest ) , combines two high voices over a simple continuo accompaniment , singing of God 's glory in the highest and peace on Earth . The music is based on the Virga Jesse floruit from the Magnificat , changing the vocal lines to the different text but retaining the " essentially lyrical character " . Gardiner notes that " goodwill towards men " is expressed in pastoral style , with the voices in parallels of tenths .

 The bass aria " Wacht auf , ihr <unk> und ihr Glieder " ( Awaken , veins and limbs ) , is a final call to wake up and join the praise of the angels . Trumpet and oboe add to energetic music .

The first triad call of the trumpet is of martial character , and imitated by the voice . When the text refers to the strings , the winds have a rest .

 = Hasvik Airport = 
 Hasvik Airport ( Norwegian : Hasvik lufthavn ; IATA : <unk> , ICAO : <unk> ) is a regional airport serving Hasvik Municipality in Finnmark county , Norway . The airport is located in the village of Hasvik on the island of <unk> . In 2012 , Hasvik Airport had 7 @,@ 629 passengers , making it the third @-@ least busy airport operated by the state @-@ owned Avinor . The airport consists of a 909 @-@ meter ( 2 @,@ 982 ft ) runway and is served by Widerøe with Dash 8 @-@ 100 aircraft . 
 Planning started in 1972 for an airport to serve air taxi and air ambulance services . The original 421 @-@ meter ( 1 @,@ 381 ft ) gravel runway opened on 17 May 1973 , allowing Norving to operate flights with their Britten @-@ Norman Islanders . The airport was upgraded with a longer runway and a larger terminal in 1983 , allowing Norving to start scheduled services to Alta and Hammerfest . Widerøe took over the routes in 1990 , at first using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter . The runway was asphalted in 1995 , allowing Widerøe to introduce the Dash 8 . The airport was nationalized two years later . 
 = = History = = 
 The first aircraft in Hasvik was an emergency landing carried out en route to Svalbard in the early 1970s . The plain where the aircraft landed , located near the village , became the site of the airport . The regional airline Norving took the initiative in 1972 to construct a simple airfield at Hasvik ; they hoped to finance along with the municipality , the National Insurance Administration and the local chapter of the Norwegian Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps . In addition to being able to operate an air taxi service and land air ambulances , locals hoped that the construction would be a first step to becoming part of the state @-@ financed construction of regional airports in Finnmark . However , Hasvik was not selected as one of the original regional airports . 
 The initial airport consisted of a 421 @-@ meter ( 1 @,@ 381 ft ) gravel runway and a spartan terminal consisting of no more than a shack . The airport opened on 17 May 1973 and Norving started an air taxi service using the eight @-@ passenger Britten @-@ Norman Islander . Grants of 3 @.@ 5 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) were issued from the state in 1981 , which was supplemented with funding from Norving , the National Insurance Administration , <unk> and local interests . The new facilities opened in early 1983 , consisting of a larger terminal and control tower and a lengthening of the runway — although it retained the gravel surface . The upgrades cost NOK 5 @.@ 8 million ; they allowed Norving to operate a daily scheduled taxi route to Hammerfest and Alta , and for the first time Hasvik was able to receive same @-@ day newspapers . The flights corresponded with Scandinavian Airlines System 's Oslo @-@ flights at Alta Airport . 
 Norving operated at the airport until 1990 , when the route was taken over by Widerøe , who initially used the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter . The Ministry of Transport and Communications announced in February 1993 that they were considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration ( CAA , later renamed Avinor ) . Along with Båtsfjord Airport and Vardø Airport , <unk> , Hasvik Airport was one of three regional airports in Finnmark with government @-@ subsidized routes which did not receive state operating grants . In December Widerøe articulated that Hasvik Airport did not meet the demands for future operation as it lacked proper instruments and did not have an asphalt runway . Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash 8 they would no longer be able to serve the airport . Additional navigation aids were installed in 1993 and the runway was asphalted in 1995 , subsequently resulting in Dash 8 services being introduced . The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997 . The runway lights were upgraded in 2008 and 2009 , followed by the installation of the Global Positioning System @-@ based landing system SCAT @-@ I. 
 Avinor wants to extend most short airports to 1200 m by year 2030 , because they see a lack of aircraft types which have more than 19 seats able to use 800 @-@ meter runways . Dash 8 built after 2009 can 't use them . Few countries apart from Norway have such short airports . There is however no room for this at Hasvik , so the plan here and for some other airports with few passengers , is to use small planes with less than 20 seats . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 Hasvik Airport has a simple terminal building with a capacity for 20 passengers per hour . It has a 909 @-@ by @-@ 30 @-@ meter ( 2 @,@ 982 by 98 ft ) asphalt runway aligned 11 / 29 . The tarmac has a place for one airliner . There is a harbor southeast of the runway which limits any expansion .

 = Robert P. Letcher = 
 Robert Perkins Letcher ( February 10 , 1788 – January 24 , 1861 ) was a politician and lawyer from the US state of Kentucky . He served as a U.S. Representative , Minister to Mexico , and the 15th Governor of Kentucky . He also served in the Kentucky General Assembly where he was Speaker of the House in 1837 and 1838 . A strong supporter of the Whig Party , he was a friend of Henry Clay and John J. Crittenden . 
 Letcher 's family came to Kentucky around 1800 . Letcher attended the private academy of Joshua Fry , then studied law . He was briefly a judge advocate in John Allen 's volunteer militia during the War of 1812 . He began his political career in 1813 , representing Garrard County in the Kentucky House of Representatives . In 1823 , he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives , where he served for more than a decade . During the 1824 presidential election , he acted as an intermediary between John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay . Adams ' opponent , Andrew Jackson , charged that , through these negotiations , Clay agreed to support Adams for president in exchange for being named Secretary of State . 
 In 1840 , Letcher was chosen as the Whig nominee for governor of Kentucky over William Owsley . In the general election , Letcher won by landslide over Judge Richard French . Letcher 's fiscally conservative policies helped Kentucky recover from the financial Panic of 1837 . By the end of his term , the state was experiencing budget surpluses and state banks had resumed specie payments . After Letcher left office , he was appointed Minister to Mexico by President Zachary Taylor . Following this , he made an attempt to return to the U.S. House , but was defeated by Democrat John C. Breckinridge . Letcher 's defeat in Henry Clay 's home district was a strong indication of the decline of Whig influence in Kentucky . Though he remained active in politics , Letcher never again sought public office . He died on January 24 , 1861 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Robert Perkins Letcher was born in Goochland County , Virginia , on February 10 , 1788 . He was seventh of twelve children born to Stephen Giles and Betsy ( Perkins ) Letcher . The family moved to Kentucky about 1800 , first living at Harrodsburg , then settling in Garrard County . For a time , Letcher attended the common schools of the area , but he was dismissed for being unruly . He studied the trade of masonry , though not very enthusiastically , at his father 's brickyard . 
 Letcher enrolled in Joshua Fry 's private academy near Danville , Kentucky , faring better under Fry 's instruction than he had in the common schools , and gained a sound education . Following his instruction at Fry 's academy , he returned to his father 's brickyard , where tradition holds that he helped build the state 's first governor 's mansion alongside future governor Thomas Metcalfe . He then read law in the office of Humphrey Marshall , was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in Lancaster , Kentucky . He briefly served as a judge advocate in Colonel John Allen 's volunteer militia during the War of 1812 . 
 Letcher first married Susan Oden Epps . Epps died on March 9 , 1816 and did not bear any children . Following the death of his first wife , Letcher married Charlotte Robertson , sister of George Robertson , a congressman and future chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals . Historian Jennie Morton records that Letcher referred to his second wife as " the queen " . No children were born as a result of this marriage , but the couple raised one of their nieces from childhood . Charlotte Letcher survived her husband , and died October 29 , 1879 . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Nicknamed " Black Bob " , Letcher was known as a witty and gregarious campaigner . He was also known to distract audiences at his opponents ' campaign speeches by playing a fiddle . His political career began in 1813 when he was elected to represent Garrard County in the Kentucky House of Representatives . He served until 1815 , and after a respite of one term , was re @-@ elected in 1817 . 
 = = = In the House of Representatives = = = 
 Letcher was elected as a Democratic Republican to the Eighteenth Congress in 1823 . He represented the state 's fourth district until 1833 , when the General Assembly conducted a redistricting of the state . After the redistricting , Garrard County became part of the fifth district . 
 Letcher was a friend and ardent supporter of Henry Clay . When no candidate gained a two @-@ thirds majority of the electoral vote in the 1824 presidential election , the outcome fell to a vote of the House of Representatives . In the political wrangling that followed , Letcher served as an intermediary between Clay and John Quincy Adams . Eventually , Clay 's supporters threw their support behind Adams , reportedly in exchange for Clay 's being named Secretary of State . Andrew Jackson called the alleged deal the " corrupt bargain " . 
 Letcher supported Adams ' administration , but became anti @-@ administration when Jackson won the 1828 presidential contest . Consistent with his support of Clay , he promoted expansion of internal improvements , including the Maysville Road bill vetoed by Jackson . In 1833 , Clay proposed a compromise in the Senate to quell the Nullification Crisis ; Letcher introduced Clay 's compromise in the House . 
 In the 1833 election , Thomas P. Moore challenged Letcher for the fifth district 's seat in the House of Representatives . Moore had previously represented the counties in the fifth district ( Garrard excepted ) , and had just returned from a four @-@ year stint as U.S. minister to Grenada . The vote was so close that the House refused to seat either candidate and ordered a new election . Letcher won the new election by 258 votes . During this term , he served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs . He did not seek re @-@ election at the end of his term . 
 In 1836 , Letcher served as a presidential elector on the Whig ticket He returned to the Kentucky House later that year , and was re @-@ elected every year until 1838 . Each of these years , he sought to become Speaker of the House . In 1836 , he was defeated by incumbent speaker John L. Helm by a vote of 45 — 48 . The following year , there was a three @-@ way contest for speaker between Letcher , Helm , and James Turner Morehead . After nine ballots , Helm withdrew from the race , and Letcher defeated Morehead 50 — 48 . The next year , Letcher was re @-@ elected to the post without opposition .

 The Whigs ' state nominating convention was held in Harrodsburg on August 26 , 1839 . Four candidates were initially put forward for the office of governor , but two withdrew from consideration , leaving the contest between Letcher and Judge William Owsley . Letcher won the nomination by a vote of 48 — 26 . In the general election , Letcher defeated his Democratic opponent , Judge Richard French , by a majority of over 15 @,@ 000 votes ( out of 95 @,@ 020 cast ) . The Whigs also captured large majorities in both houses of the state legislature . 
 Just weeks after Letcher 's inauguration , William Henry Harrison prevailed in the 1840 presidential election . Soon after , Harrison visited Letcher in Frankfort to discuss the appointment of Letcher 's friend John J. Crittenden to Harrison 's cabinet . On December 14 , 1840 , Letcher wrote Crittenden to tell him that the General Assembly would shortly re @-@ elect him to his Senate seat . If he ( Crittenden ) were going to accept a position in President Harrison 's cabinet , Letcher would prefer he do it before March 4 , 1841 so the General Assembly would still be in session to elect Crittenden 's replacement in the Senate . On January 11 , 1841 , Crittenden replied that he expected to be named attorney general and believed he could accept the post before Letcher 's preferred deadline . However , due to Harrison 's death only a month after his inauguration , Crittenden was not able to keep Letcher 's timeline ; he was appointed attorney general by John Tyler on March 5 , 1841 . 
 For the first half of Letcher 's term , the state was still struggling to recover from the financial Panic of 1837 . Consistent with his Whig views , Letcher blamed the crisis on the federal government 's failure to recharter the Second Bank of the United States . To ameliorate the state 's dire financial situation , Letcher drastically cut spending , including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green , Kentucky , and Licking rivers . These actions greatly reduced the state 's deficit and improved its credit . In each of Letcher 's years in office , the state showed a small but growing budget surplus . 
 Although Letcher generally opposed debt relief measures , he did allow the passage of some minor legislation to aid those most in danger of foreclosure on their property . In 1842 , legislation was passed that expanded the types of personal property that were exempted from foreclosure . The next year , the General Assembly eliminated the summer terms of the circuit courts , effectively delaying some foreclosure hearings . Letcher also encouraged banks to make new small loans , and the legislature followed suit by moderately increasing the credit extended by state banks . As the state 's economy recovered , its banks resumed specie payments . State bonds increased in value . By the end of Letcher 's term , Kentucky had weathered the worst of the economic crisis . 
 In one of his final acts as governor , Letcher proclaimed the first thanksgiving day in Kentucky on September 26 , 1844 . After leaving office , he resumed his law practice in Frankfort . In 1847 , he was one of four contenders for a seat in the U.S. Senate . The other contenders consisted of two fellow Whigs and a Democrat . After twenty @-@ eight ballots , no winner emerged , and Letcher 's supporters withdrew his name and nominated Joseph R. Underwood , who eventually won the seat . 
 = = = As a diplomat to Mexico = = = 
 Letcher was a strong supporter of Whig candidate Zachary Taylor in the 1848 presidential election . When Taylor won the election , Letcher 's friend John J. Crittenden recommended Letcher for the post of postmaster general ; Taylor declined this suggestion , but instead appointed Letcher as the United States envoy and minister to Mexico . Letcher arrived in Mexico City on February 3 , 1850 . 
 Letcher 's primary responsibility was negotiating a treaty to protect the interests of some American citizens who had purchased the rights to construct a line of transit on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . He submitted a rough draft of the treaty to Mexican officials in March 1850 . After nearly three months of negotiation , Letcher signed a modified treaty on June 22 , 1850 . Among the modifications were a provision that tolls on Mexican @-@ produced goods transported on the route would be twenty @-@ percent less than those of United States goods and an increase in the authority exercised by Mexico in protecting the route . Letcher wrote to Secretary of State John M. Clayton that the treaty fell short of what he had hoped for , but that he believed that its provisions were the best that could be obtained . 
 A month after Letcher signed the treaty , Clayton was replaced as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster . In response to concerns raised by one of the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit , Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications to the treaty . Letcher brought these modifications to the Mexican diplomats , but they steadfastly refused to accept them . Letcher , speaking with the blessing of the administration , intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made . The Mexican government conceded that they would not be able to resist such action , but still refused to accept the modifications to the treaty . 
 Upon learning of the strong Mexican resistance to his proposed modifications , Webster instructed Letcher to negotiate the most favorable terms to which the Mexicans would agree . On January 25 , 1851 , Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans . During the time it had taken both sides to negotiate the treaty , however , public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec . On May 22 , 1851 , the Mexican government declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted it did not have the right to do so . Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re @-@ acquire the rights nullified by the Mexican government , but by February 14 , 1852 , he reported that he did not expect to be able to reach any kind of agreement . He returned home in August 1852 . 
 = = = Later political career = = = 
 On returning to Kentucky , Letcher resumed his legal practice . While he was away in Mexico , the congressional seat of Kentucky 's Eighth District was won by Democrat John C. Breckinridge . Known as the " Ashland district " because it contained Henry Clay 's Ashland estate and much of the territory he once represented , it was a Whig bastion that hadn 't been represented by a Democrat since 1828 . Whigs were eager to avenge the loss in 1853 , and Letcher wanted to be their candidate , but at their state convention , they chose Kentucky Attorney General James Harlan . The nomination was not well @-@ received among some Whig factions ; Harlan withdrew in March 1853 , and Letcher was chosen to replace him . 
 Letcher first met Breckinridge in debate at Nicholasville on April 18 , 1853 . As the incumbent , Breckinridge spoke first and focused on political issues like contrasting the higher revenue generated by the Democratic Walker tariff with that produced by the higher Tariff of 1842 favored by the Whigs . Letcher , as he did for much of the campaign , responded by appealing to party loyalty ; Breckinridge would misrepresent the district , he claimed , " because he is a Democrat " . While Breckinridge was typically well composed in debate , Letcher would often become angry . On one occasion , Letcher so frequently attempted to interrupt Breckinridge that John J. Crittenden grabbed him by the coat tails to restrain him . Breckinridge supporters derisively nicknamed Letcher " Coat Tails " for the remainder of the campaign . 
 When Letcher 's factional enemy , abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay , endorsed Breckinridge , Letcher charged that this , combined with the abolitionist views of Breckinridge 's uncle , Reverend Robert Jefferson Breckinridge , proved that Breckinridge was secretly an abolitionist , despite his consistent denial that Congress had the power to interfere with that institution . Breckinridge responded by citing newspaper accounts of an 1848 campaign speech Letcher had made in Indiana on behalf of Zachary Taylor . In the speech , he predicted that the constitutional convention then under way in Kentucky would produce a document that contained provisions for gradual emancipation , noting " It is only the ultra men in the extreme South who desire the extension of slavery . " 
 Both candidates received financial support from outside the district , some of which was used to buy votes or bribe voters to stay home . Breckinridge received several thousand dollars , with a substantial amount coming from Washington , D.C. banker William Wilson Corcoran ; estimates of Letcher 's support ranged from $ 30 @,@ 000 to $ 100 @,@ 000 . Breckinridge won the canvass by 526 votes and received 71 % of the vote in Owen County , which recorded 123 more votes than registered voters . 
 Letcher was considered the strongest Whig candidate in the state , and his inability to win the seat was a harbinger of the ultimate failure of the Whig Party in Kentucky . His loss to Breckinridge would be his last run for public office , though he remained active in politics until his death . During the 1856 presidential election , Letcher spoke on behalf of Millard Fillmore in Pennsylvania , New York , and Kentucky . In 1857 and 1858 , he urged John J. Crittenden to oppose the Lecompton Constitution for Kansas . 
 After the dissolution of the Whig Party , Letcher generally supported Know @-@ Nothing candidates in state politics . Letcher and Crittenden both supported National Union candidate John Bell in the 1860 presidential election , believing he represented the best hope of peacefully resolving the tension between the north and south . By election day , his health was beginning to fail . He died at his home in Frankfort on January 24 , 1861 , and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery . Letcher County , Kentucky is named in his honor . 
 = History of the National Hockey League ( 1917 – 42 ) = 
 The National Hockey League ( NHL ) was founded in 1917 following the demise of its predecessor league , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) . In an effort to remove Eddie Livingstone as owner of the Toronto Blueshirts , a majority of the NHA franchises ( the Montreal Canadiens , Montreal Wanderers , Ottawa Senators and Quebec Bulldogs ) suspended the NHA and formed the new NHL . Quebec , while a member , did not operate in the NHL for the first two years . Instead the owners of the Toronto Arena Gardens operated a new Toronto franchise . While the NHL was intended as a temporary measure , the continuing dispute with Livingstone led to the four NHA owners meeting and making the suspension of the NHA permanent one year later . 
 The NHL 's first quarter @-@ century saw the league compete against two rival major leagues , the Pacific Coast Hockey Association and Western Canada Hockey League , for players and the Stanley Cup . The NHL first expanded into the United States in 1924 with the founding of the Boston Bruins , and by 1926 consisted of ten teams in Ontario , Quebec , the Great Lakes region , and the Northeastern United States . At the same time , the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup . 
 The game itself continued to evolve during this time . Numerous innovations to the rules and equipment were put forward as the NHL sought to improve the flow of the game and make the sport more fan @-@ friendly . The NHL played with six men to a side rather than the traditional seven , and was among the first leagues to allow goaltenders to leave their feet to make saves . The NHL 's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt 's radio broadcasts were heard coast @-@ to @-@ coast starting in 1933 . 
 The Montreal Forum and Maple Leaf Gardens were built , and each played host to All @-@ Star benefit games held to raise money to support Ace Bailey and the family of Howie Morenz in Toronto and Montreal , respectively . Both players ' careers had ended due to an on @-@ ice incident , with Morenz eventually dying , a month after he sustained his initial injury . These early NHL All @-@ Star games would lead to the annual All @-@ Star games which continue today . 
 The Great Depression and World War II reduced the league to six teams by 1942 . Founding team Ottawa , and expansion teams New York Americans , Montreal Maroons and Pittsburgh Pirates / Philadelphia Quakers passed from the scene . Expansion team Detroit Falcons declared bankruptcy in 1932 and only survived through a merger with the Chicago Shamrocks of the American Hockey League and the pockets of prosperous owner James Norris to become the Detroit Red Wings . Desperate conditions in Montreal meant that the city nearly lost both of its teams in the 1930s ; the Canadiens nearly moved to Cleveland , but survived due to its stronger fan support . The six teams left standing in 1942 ( the Boston Bruins , Chicago Black Hawks , Detroit Red Wings , Montreal Canadiens , New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs ) are known today as the " Original Six " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The first attempts to regulate competitive ice hockey matches came in the late 1880s . Before then , teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time . In 1887 , four clubs from Montreal ( the <unk> , the Crystals , the Victorias , and McGill University ) and the Ottawa HC ) formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada ( AHAC ) and developed a structured schedule . Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup and appointed Sheriff John Sweetland and Philip <unk> Ross as its trustees ; they chose to award it to the best team in the AHAC , or to any pre @-@ approved team that won it in a challenge . Since the Cup carried an air of nobility , its prestige greatly benefited the AHAC . 
 The coordination and regularized schedule that the AHAC brought helped commercialize amateur ice hockey , which ran against the spirit of the prevailing amateur ethic . As the importance of winning grew , AHAC clubs began recruiting players from outside , and the disparity in skill between teams of the AHAC and those of other leagues became clearer . Since team owners in the AHAC wanted to defend the Stanley Cup and maintain the organization 's honour , and rink owners wanted senior hockey as their marquee attraction , AHAC clubs became increasingly reluctant about admitting new teams into the league and the senior series . When the relatively weak Ottawa Capitals joined in 1898 , the five original clubs withdrew from the AHAC to form the new Canadian Amateur Hockey League ( CAHL ) . In 1903 , four new teams created the Federal Amateur Hockey League ( FAHL ) , and in 1904 , the International Hockey League ( IHL ) , based in both Sault Ste . Maries , the Upper Peninsula of Michigan , and Pennsylvania , was created as the first fully professional league . The IHL 's ability to pay salaries caused an " Athletic War " that drained amateur clubs of top players , most noticeably in the Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) . 
 By the 1905 – 06 season , several of the FAHL and CAHL markets were overcrowded ; Montreal alone had seven clubs . To solve the problem , the leagues merged into the new Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ( ECAHA ) , which kept four of the Montreal clubs . The new league mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters , which led to the demise of the IHL . With the IHL gone , teams from Toronto , Berlin ( now Kitchener ) , Brantford , and Guelph filled the void with the Ontario Professional Hockey League ( OPHL ) . Bidding wars for players led many ECAHA teams to lose money , and before the 1907 – 08 season , the Montreal Victorias and the Montreal HC left . The ECAHA dropped " Amateur " from its name for the 1909 season , and on November 25 , it folded . Ottawa HC , Quebec HC , and the Montreal Shamrocks founded the Canadian Hockey Association ( CHA ) , and the league later admitted the Montreal Le National and All @-@ Montreal HC . Rejected CHA applicants formed the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) . 
 When compared to the CHA , the geographical distances between NHA teams were much greater ; however , the NHA 's financial backers were more notable businessmen . These businessmen applied financial principles similar to those of early baseball , and the leagues quickly entered a bitter bidding war over players . In particular , after being rejected from the CHA , Renfrew aggressively pursued any players that the CHA 's Ottawa club wanted . Montreal became a notable battleground as the NHA established two franchises , including the modern @-@ day Montreal Canadiens . With its significantly wealthier backers , the NHA easily recruited the top players , leaving the CHA teams , except Ottawa , relatively mediocre . Ottawa regularly trounced its opponents , and league attendance and interest dropped . The CHA 's final season lasted eight games , and the league folded in 1910 , as its Ottawa and Montreal clubs joined the NHA . 
 = = Founding = = 
 In the 1916 – 17 season , the NHA was facing numerous problems . The Quebec Bulldogs were in financial difficulty , while the league 's most popular team , the Toronto 228th Battalion , was called away to fight in World War I. Several of the league 's team owners were growing frustrated with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone , with whom they had been having problems since 1915 . Prior to the start of the season , the owners of the Montreal teams , Sam Lichtenhein of the Wanderers and George Kennedy of the Canadiens , threatened to drop the Blueshirts from the league over a player dispute Livingstone was having with the 228th Battalion . Livingstone was also in a dispute with the Ottawa Senators over the rights to Cy Denneny , while Kennedy and Livingstone had a mutual dislike that occasionally threatened to come to blows at league meetings . 
 The remaining owners used the loss of the 228th Battalion as a reason to eliminate the Blueshirts on February 11 , 1917 . The Montreal teams led a motion to reduce the NHA to four teams by removing the Blueshirts , ignoring Livingstone 's attempts to create a revamped five @-@ team schedule . Livingstone was promised that his players would be returned to him after the season . The dispersal of the Blueshirts ' players , organized by league secretary Frank Calder , was described by the Toronto Mail and Empire as a " raid of the Toronto players " . At the same meeting , the league adopted a motion commanding Livingstone sell the Blueshirts by June 1 . 
 By November 1917 , with the sale of Livingstone 's Blueshirts still not completed , the remaining owners , realizing they were powerless under the NHA constitution to forcibly eject Livingstone , decided to suspend the NHA and form a new league without Livingstone . On November 26 , 1917 , following several meetings of the NHA owners throughout the month , the National Hockey League was created at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal . The new league was represented by Lichtenhein 's Wanderers , Kennedy 's Canadiens , Tommy Gorman on behalf of the Senators , and Mike Quinn of the Bulldogs . A new team in Toronto , under the control of the Toronto Arena Company , completed the five @-@ team league . The NHL adopted the NHA 's constitution and named Calder its first president . Quebec retained membership in the NHL , but did not operate that season , so their players were dispersed by draft among the other teams . 
 = = = Minutes of the first meeting = = = 
 At a meeting of representatives of hockey clubs held at the Windsor Hotel , Montreal , November 22nd , 1917 [ , ] the following present [ , ] G.W. Kendall , S.E. Lichtenhein , T.P. Gorman , M.J. Quinn and Frank Calder , it was explained by the last named that in view of the suspension of operations by the National Hockey Association of Canada Limited , he had called the meeting at the suggestion of the Quebec Hockey Club to ascertain if some steps could not be taken to perpetuate the game of Hockey . 
 Frank Calder was elected to the Chair and a discussion ensued after which it was moved by T.P. Gorman , seconded by G.W. Kendall [ : ] " That the Canadien , Wanderer , Ottawa and Quebec Hockey Clubs unite to comprise the National Hockey League " . The motion was carried . 
 It was then moved by M.J. Quinn seconded by G.W. Kendall that : " This League agrees to operate under the rules and conditions governing the game of hockey prescribed by the National Hockey Association of Canada Limited " . The motion was carried . 
 At this stage , Mr. W.E. Northey , representing the Toronto Arena Company asked to be admitted to the meeting and was admitted . Mr. Northey explained that he was empowered by the interests he represented to say that in the event of a league being formed to contain four clubs , the Toronto Arena desired to enter a team in the competition . 
 Upon this assurance M.J. Quinn on behalf of Quebec Hockey Club declared the latter willing to withdraw provided a suitable arrangement could be made regarding players then the property of the Quebec Hockey Club . 
 After discussion it was unanimously agreed that the Quebec players be taken over by the league at a cost of $ 700 ( Seven Hundred Dollars ) of which amount 50 % should be paid to the Quebec Hockey Club by the club winning the championship , 30 % by the second club and 20 % by the third club in the race .... 
 The meeting then proceeded to the election of officers . The following directors were elected S.E. Lichtenhein ( Wanderers ) , Martin Rosenthal ( Ottawa ) , G.W. Kendall ( Canadiens ) and a director to be named by the Toronto club . 
 M.J. Quinn was elected Honorary President with power to vote on matters pertaining to the general welfare of the league . 
 Frank Calder was elected President and Secretary @-@ Treasurer at a salary of $ 800 ( Eight Hundred Dollars ) on the understanding that there could be no appeal from his decisions .... 
 The NHL was intended to be a temporary league , as the owners hoped to remove Livingstone from Toronto , then return to the NHA in 1918 – 19 . Livingstone had other ideas , filing lawsuits against the new league , the owners and the players in an attempt to keep his team operating . Nonetheless , the NHL began play three weeks after it was created , with the first games held on December 19 in Ottawa and Montreal . 
 = = Early years = = 
 The NHL 's first superstar was " Phantom " Joe Malone . A two @-@ time NHA scoring champion , Malone scored five goals for the Montreal Canadiens in a 7 – 4 victory over the Ottawa Senators on the NHL 's opening night . Malone went on to record a league @-@ leading 44 goals in 20 games in 1917 – 18 . He again led the NHL in scoring in 1919 – 20 , scoring 39 goals in 24 games with Quebec . During that season , on January 20 , 1920 , Malone scored seven goals in one game against the Toronto St. Patricks , a record that still stands today . Malone was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950 . 
 The first goal in NHL history was scored by Dave Ritchie of the Montreal Wanderers one minute into a 10 – 9 win over Toronto , which was the only victory the Wanderers recorded in the NHL . On January 2 , 1918 , a fire destroyed the Montreal Arena , home to both the Wanderers and the Canadiens . While the Canadiens relocated to the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ seat Jubilee Arena , Lichtenhein chose to withdraw the Wanderers , citing the lack of available players due to the war . The NHL continued on as a three @-@ team league until Quebec returned to it in 1919 . 
 In its first years , the NHL continued the NHA 's split season format . The first @-@ half champion Canadiens fell to the second @-@ half champion Toronto team in the 1918 playoffs for the O 'Brien Cup by a combined score of 10 – 7 in a two @-@ game , total goals series . The victory gave Toronto the right to face the Pacific Coast Hockey Association 's champion , the Vancouver Millionaires , in the Stanley Cup final . The Torontos defeated Vancouver to become the first NHL team to win the Cup . 
 The Canadiens won the NHL championship over the Senators in 1918 – 19 , and traveled west to meet the PCHA 's champion , the Seattle Metropolitans . The series is best remembered for its cancellation with the series tied at two wins , two losses , and a tie ( 2 – 2 – 1 ) due to the Spanish flu pandemic . Several players from both teams became ill , prompting health officials in Seattle to cancel the sixth , and deciding , game . Canadiens defenceman Joe Hall died as a result of the flu on April 5 , 1919 . 
 Meanwhile , defending champions Toronto finished in last place in both halves of the 1918 – 19 season . On February 20 , 1919 , Toronto informed the league that it was withdrawing from competition . The NHL avoided being reduced to two teams for 1919 – 20 when the team was reorganized as the Toronto St. Patricks . The Quebec franchise also returned , ( known for the season as the Quebec Athletic Club ) increasing the league to four teams . The Quebec club posted a 4 – 20 record in 1919 – 20 , despite the return of Malone . It was the franchise 's final season in Quebec City , relocating to Hamilton , Ontario , in 1920 to become the Hamilton Tigers . 
 Throughout , Livingstone continued to try to revive the NHA , convening league meetings on September 20 and December 11 , 1918 , which representatives of the Canadiens , Senators and Wanderers determined to close out the expired league for good . 
 = = = Competition with the WCHL = = = 
 Beginning in 1921 , the NHL faced competition from a third major league , the prairie @-@ based Western Canada Hockey League ( WCHL ) . With three leagues competing for talent , ice hockey players were among the highest @-@ paid athletes in North America . They commanded salaries equivalent to the top Major League Baseball players of the era . The WCHL only survived for six seasons , merging with the PCHA in 1924 , but challenged the NHL for the Stanley Cup four times . In the 1923 Stanley Cup Finals , the Senators defeated the Edmonton Eskimos after eliminating the PCHA 's Vancouver Millionaires . In 1924 , the Canadiens defeated the PCHA 's Millionaires and the WCHL 's Calgary Tigers on the strength of two shutouts by Georges Vezina and a strong offensive showing by rookie forward Howie Morenz . 
 In 1924 – 25 , the Hamilton Tigers finished first in the NHL after four consecutive last @-@ place finishes . While the Canadiens and St. Patricks prepared to play in a semi @-@ final playoff round , the Tigers ' players , upset that the team had turned a sizable profit despite claiming financial difficulty , went on strike to demand a C $ 200 playoff bonus each . Threatened with fines , suspension and a possible lawsuit by league president Frank Calder , the players , led by Billy Burch and Shorty Green , held firm . Calder then suspended the entire team and declared Montreal the NHL champions after they defeated Toronto in the semi @-@ final . 
 The Canadiens faced the Victoria Cougars , then of the WCHL , in the 1925 Stanley Cup Finals . Victoria defeated Montreal three games to one in the best @-@ of @-@ five final . In doing so , they became the last non @-@ NHL team to win the Stanley Cup . The WCHL ceased operations one year later , with its assets purchased by the NHL for $ 300 @,@ 000 . The rights to the Tigers ' players , meanwhile , were purchased for $ 75 @,@ 000 by New York mobster Bill Dwyer to stock his expansion New York Americans . The Americans began play in 1925 , replacing the Tigers . 
 = = 1920s expansion = = 
 The NHL grew to six teams in 1924 , adding a second team in Montreal , the Maroons , and the first American team , the Boston Bruins . The Bruins were purchased by Charles Adams , a grocery store financier who first developed an interest in hockey during the Stanley Cup playoffs , paying $ 15 @,@ 000 for the team . The Maroons were created to replace the Wanderers and to appeal to the English population of Montreal . The first NHL game played in the United States was a 2 – 1 Bruins victory over the Maroons at the Boston Arena on December 1 , 1924 , at an ice hockey venue which still exists today , and is used in the 21st century for American college hockey and other indoor collegiate sports . 
 The Montreal Forum , which in later decades became synonymous with the Canadiens , was built in 1924 to house the Maroons . The Canadiens did not move into the Forum until two years later . The Forum hosted its first Stanley Cup final in its second year , as the Maroons defeated the WCHL 's Victoria Cougars in the 1926 Stanley Cup Finals , the last time a non @-@ NHL team competed for the Cup . 
 The New York Americans began play in 1925 along with the NHL 's third American @-@ based team , the Pittsburgh Pirates . Three more teams were added for the 1926 – 27 season . Tex Rickard , operator of the then @-@ new , 1925 @-@ completed Madison Square Garden , had reluctantly allowed the Americans into his arena the year before . However , the Americans were so popular in New York he felt his arena could support a second team . As a result , the New York Rangers were granted to Rickard on May 15 , 1926 . In November of that year , the league announced that the cities of Detroit and Chicago would get teams . Detroit purchased the assets of the Victoria Cougars to stock the expansion Detroit Cougars . The players of the Portland Rosebuds were sold to coffee tycoon Frederic McLaughlin for his new Chicago Black Hawks team . The three new franchises brought the NHL to ten teams . 
 The Rangers reached the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals , in just their second season , against the Maroons . Lorne Chabot was injured early in the second game of the series , leaving the Rangers without a goaltender . As the Maroons were unwilling to allow the Rangers to substitute a goaltender watching from the Montreal Forum stands , Rangers coach Lester Patrick was forced into goal himself . A defenceman during his playing days , the 44 @-@ year @-@ old Patrick allowed only one goal on 19 shots as the Rangers won the game in overtime , 2 – 1 . The Rangers signed New York Americans goaltender Joe Miller the next day , and went on to capture the Stanley Cup in five games .

 = = = Livingstone 's court battles = = = 
 Throughout the NHL 's first decade , Eddie Livingstone continued to press his claim to the Toronto franchise in court . On October 18 , 1923 , the Supreme Court of Ontario awarded Livingstone $ 100 @,@ 000 in damages . St. Patricks owner Charlie Querrie made numerous attempts to prevent Livingstone from collecting on his awards . In 1923 , he transferred the ownership of his team to his wife , Ida , making her the first female owner in ice hockey history . The $ 100 @,@ 000 award was later reduced to $ 10 @,@ 000 by the Ontario Court of Appeal , causing Livingstone to appeal to the highest court in the British Empire , the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London , England ; the court denied his claim . 
 Despite the reduced awards , the <unk> found the pressures of meeting their obligations to Livingstone too great and , as a result , placed the St. Patricks up for sale in 1927 . On February 14 , 1927 , the St. Patricks were sold to a group represented by Conn Smythe for $ 160 @,@ 000 despite a potentially greater offer from a Philadelphia @-@ based group . Among the first moves Smythe made was to rename his team the Toronto Maple Leafs . 
 When Smythe bought the Leafs , he promised that the team would win the Stanley Cup within five years . To that end , Smythe wanted to bring in a star player to help his team . In 1930 , with the Senators struggling financially due to the Great Depression , they put King Clancy up for sale . Smythe 's partners could only offer $ 25 @,@ 000 for Ottawa 's defensive star , one @-@ half of Ottawa 's asking price . In an attempt to raise money , Smythe entered a thoroughbred racing horse he owned , Rare Jewel , in the Coronation Futurity Stakes at odds of 106 – 1 . Rare Jewel won the race , earning Smythe over $ 15 @,@ 000 . Smythe then acquired Clancy for $ 35 @,@ 000 and two players worth $ 15 @,@ 000 , which was an unprecedented price to pay for one player . It was also the only race Rare Jewel ever won . 
 = = = " Smythe 's Folly " = = = 
 Smythe also envisioned building a new shrine for his team . He described it as " a place where people can go in evening clothes , if they want to come there for a party or dinner ... a place that people can be proud to bring their wives or girlfriends to " . Smythe purchased a piece of land at the corner of Church and Carlton Streets from the Eaton 's department store chain for $ 350 @,@ 000 . Skeptics argued that Smythe would never get the arena built , nor fill it , as the Depression was in full swing . They referred to the arena plan as " Smythe 's Folly " . To help fund the arena , the Leafs convinced construction workers to accept 20 % of their wages in shares in the arena . Just 4 ½ months after breaking ground , Maple Leaf Gardens opened on November 12 , 1931 . Many in the sold @-@ out crowd of over 13 @,@ 000 wore evening clothes in response to Smythe 's stated goal in building the arena . In 1932 , five years after Smythe 's promise , the Leafs won the Stanley Cup in three games over the Rangers . 
 Maple Leaf Gardens also featured the famous " gondola " , a broadcast booth specially constructed for Foster Hewitt . Hewitt began broadcasting hockey games in 1923 on <unk> , a radio station owned by his father , W. A. Hewitt . It was an assignment he initially did not want . Smythe supported the broadcast of Leafs games in contrast of other team owners , who feared that airing games on the radio would cut into gate receipts . By 1931 , Hewitt had established himself as the voice of hockey in Canada with his famous catchphrase : " he shoots , he scores ! " On January 1 , 1933 , Leafs ' broadcasts were first heard across Canada on 20 stations of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission ( today the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ) . Hewitt 's broadcasts quickly attracted audiences of over one million listeners . The broadcasts were a precursor to Hockey Night in Canada , a Saturday night tradition that continues today . 
 = = = Ace Bailey benefit game = = = 
 On December 13 , 1933 , Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore , in a daze following what he thought was a check by Toronto 's Ace Bailey , charged the latter player from behind , flipping Bailey into the air and causing him to suffer a severe skull fracture after he landed on his head . The check was so vicious that Bailey was given the last rites before being transported to the hospital in Boston . <unk> operated throughout the night to save his life ; however , Bailey 's prognosis was so grim that morning papers printed his death notice . Bailey survived , but he never played professionally again . Shore ultimately served a 16 @-@ game suspension for the hit , and avoided being charged with manslaughter had Bailey died . 
 To raise money for Bailey 's recovery , Maple Leaf Gardens hosted the Ace Bailey All @-@ Star Benefit Game on February 14 , 1934 . The Maple Leafs defeated an all @-@ star team of players from the rest of the league 7 – 3 while raising over $ 20 @,@ 000 . Prior to the game , the Leafs announced that no Toronto player would ever wear Bailey 's # 6 again , marking the first time in NHL history that a team retired a player 's jersey number . Before the game , each player came out and shook Bailey 's hand as they received their all @-@ star jersey . The last player to do so was Eddie Shore . The crowd , which had fallen silent as Shore approached , erupted into loud cheering as Bailey extended his hand towards his attacker . Elmer Ferguson described the moment as " the most completely dramatic event I ever saw in hockey " .

 While Smythe was building Maple Leaf Gardens , several other teams were facing financial difficulty . At the end of the 1929 – 30 season , the Pittsburgh Pirates were US $ 400 @,@ 000 in debt and relocated to Philadelphia , to become the Philadelphia Quakers . The Quakers lasted only one season before suspending operations in 1931 , along with the Ottawa Senators . The Quakers never returned , but Ottawa resumed operations in 1932 – 33 . The Senators continued to struggle , and despite a promise by Calder in 1934 that the Senators would never leave " hockey 's birthplace of Canada " , the team was nonetheless transferred south to become the St. Louis Eagles . The Eagles played only one year in St. Louis before asking for permission to suspend operations . The league refused , and instead bought and dissolved the team . The Eagles ' players were dispersed amongst the remaining teams . It was announced that the NHL would be an eight @-@ team league in 1935 – 36 . 
 That summer , the Canadiens ' franchise was for sale , after posting losses of $ 60 @,@ 000 over the previous two seasons . Over forty thousand families and 150 @,@ 000 individuals were receiving social assistance in Montreal . Owners Leo Dandurand and Joseph Cattarinich held negotiations with A. C. Sutphin to sell the club and move it to Cleveland . Just before the season , a syndicate of local Montreal businessmen , led by Maurice Forget and Ernest Savard , stepped forward to buy the club and prevent the transfer . 
 = = = Howie Morenz = = = 
 At the same time , the league reduced its salary cap to $ 62 @,@ 500 per team , and $ 7 @,@ 000 per player . Several well @-@ paid star players were traded as teams attempted to fit under the cap . The biggest name was Montreal 's Howie Morenz , a three @-@ time Hart Trophy winner , two @-@ time scoring leader and the face of the Canadiens organization . Drawing only 2 @,@ 000 fans per game in an arena that held 10 @,@ 000 , Canadiens owner Léo Dandurand sent his star to the Black Hawks . The Montreal fans voiced their opinion of the deal by giving Morenz a standing ovation when he scored against the Canadiens on the last day of the 1935 season . Less than two seasons later , Morenz was traded back to Montreal after a brief time playing for the Rangers . 
 On January 28 , 1937 , Morenz 's skate caught on the ice while he was being checked by Chicago 's Earl Seibert ; he broke his leg in four places . On March 8 , Morenz died of a coronary embolism . Morenz 's teammate Aurèle Joliat had a different explanation of his death : " Howie loved to play hockey more than anyone ever loved anything , and when he realized that he would never play again , he couldn 't live with it . I think Howie died of a broken heart . " On the day of his funeral , 50 @,@ 000 people filed past Morenz 's casket at centre ice of the Montreal Forum to pay their last respects to the man the media called " the Babe Ruth of hockey " . A benefit game held in November 1937 raised $ 20 @,@ 000 for Morenz 's family as the NHL All @-@ Stars defeated the Montreal Canadiens 6 – 5 .

 In the mid @-@ 1930s , Black Hawks owner and staunch American nationalist Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager to compile a team of only American players . At the time , Taffy Abel was the only American @-@ born player who was a regular player in the league . The Black Hawks hired Major League Baseball umpire Bill Stewart to be the first American coach in NHL history . They were led in goal by Minnesotan Mike Karakas , one of eight Americans on the 14 @-@ man roster . The 1937 – 38 Black Hawks " All @-@ American " team won only 14 of 48 games , finishing third in the American division . In the playoffs , however , the Hawks upset the Canadiens and the Americans to reach the Stanley Cup Final against the heavily favoured Maple Leafs . 
 In the first game of the final , the Hawks were forced to use minor @-@ league goaltender Alfie Moore after Karakas suffered a broken toe . Moore led the Hawks to a 3 – 1 victory before being ruled ineligible to play the rest of the series by the NHL . After Chicago lost game two , Karakas returned wearing a steel @-@ toed boot and led the Hawks to victories in games three and four , and the Stanley Cup . The 1938 Black Hawks remain the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular @-@ season record .

 In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals , the heavily favoured Maple Leafs initially found themselves unable to counter the fifth @-@ place Red Wings ' strategy of firing the puck into the offensive zone then chasing after it , losing the first three games of the final as a result . Jack Adams ' " dump @-@ and @-@ chase " tactic led Leafs goaltender Turk Broda to declare the Wings " unbeatable " . Toronto rebounded , however , winning the final four games , and the Stanley Cup . The 1942 Leafs remain the only team in NHL history to come back from a 3 – 0 deficit to win a championship series . 
 In financial difficulty , and unable to compete with the Canadiens for fan support in Montreal , the Maroons suspended operations prior to the 1938 – 39 season after being denied permission to relocate to St. Louis . Six Maroons players were transferred to the Canadiens while three were sold to the Black Hawks . The Americans , also struggling in New York and under the control of the league , were turned over to Red Dutton in 1940 with orders to improve the club 's finances . By 1942 , 90 players had left the NHL for active duty during World War II . Continuing to struggle financially , and due to a lack of players , the Americans were suspended prior to the 1942 – 43 season . Thus began what became known as the " Original Six " era of the National Hockey League . 
 = = Rules and innovations = = 
 The 1920s saw numerous rule innovations as the sport evolved . The Ottawa Senators won three Stanley Cups in the early 1920s using strong defence , and the goaltending of Clint Benedict , who recorded a record five shutouts in a 24 @-@ game season in 1921 . The Senators employed a strategy where they kept both defencemen and a forward in their own zone at all times after they gained a lead . After the Senators ' third championship in 1924 , Frank Calder made it illegal for more than two players to be in their defensive zone if the puck was not . 
 Defence continued to dominate the game , however , as in 1928 – 29 , the league averaged less than three goals per game . Canadiens goaltender George Hainsworth set what remains a league record with 22 shutouts in only 44 games . As a result , the league allowed the use of the forward pass in all zones beginning in 1929 . Previously , forward passing was allowed only in the defensive and neutral zones . The change saw offence rise to 6 @.@ 9 goals per game over the first third of the season as players began to park themselves on their opponent 's goal crease . The league responded by introducing the offside rule early in the 1929 – 30 season , barring offensive players from entering their opponent 's zone before the puck . Despite this , Cooney Weiland , Dit Clapper and Howie Morenz all broke the 40 @-@ goal mark , the first players to do so since Joe Malone scored 44 in the NHL 's first season . 
 Boston Bruins governor , Charles Adams had long disliked the defensive tactic of shooting the puck the length of the ice ( " icing " ) to relieve pressure . After the New York Americans iced the puck 61 times in a 3 – 2 win in Boston during the 1936 – 37 season , Adams promised that he would see to it that the Bruins played a similar style in New York . True to his word , the Bruins iced the puck 87 times in a 0 – 0 tie at Madison Square Garden . The NHL introduced the icing rule the following season , calling for a faceoff in the offending team 's defensive zone after each infraction . 
 Benedict became the first goaltender to wear facial protection during a game , as he donned a leather mask to protect a broken nose on January 20 , 1930 . The mask obscured Benedict 's vision , and he abandoned it shortly after . Later that season , Benedict was again hit by a puck , effectively ending his NHL career . It was not the first attempt at changing how goaltenders played their position . When the NHL was formed , the league abandoned the rule forbidding goaltenders from leaving their feet to make a save . While the NHA imposed a $ 2 fine every time a goalie left his feet , Calder dismissed the idea for the NHL . He was quoted as saying : " as far as I 'm concerned , they can stand on their head if they choose to " . The phrase became , and remains today , a popular way to describe a goaltender who plays a great game . 
 Art Ross was an early innovator of the game . He designed rounded goal nets that became the league standard , replacing the old square @-@ backed nets . He also successfully argued for using synthetic rubber pucks rather than real rubber . Some of Ross ' inventions did not catch on , however . Ross invented a puck with rounded edges that was rejected after goaltenders complained about their erratic behaviour on the ice . He also created a two @-@ piece hockey stick that had a metal shaft and replaceable wooden blades . The idea did not catch on at the time , but was a forerunner to modern composite sticks used today .

 = Cherry Poppin ' Daddies = 
 The Cherry Poppin ' Daddies are an American band established in Eugene , Oregon in 1989 . Formed by singer Steve Perry and bassist Dan Schmid , the band has experienced many membership changes over the years , with only Perry , Schmid and trumpeter Dana Heitman currently remaining from the founding line @-@ up . 
 The Daddies ' music is primarily a mix of swing and ska , contrastingly encompassing both traditional jazz @-@ influenced forms of the genres as well as modern rock , pop and punk hybrids , characterized by a prominent horn section and Perry 's darkly mordant lyricism . While the band 's earliest releases were rooted mostly in punk rock and funk , their subsequent studio albums have since incorporated elements from many diverse genres of popular music and Americana into their sound , including rockabilly , rhythm and blues , soul and world music . 
 Having first established themselves in the West Coast third wave ska scene , the Daddies ultimately broke into the musical mainstream with their 1997 swing compilation Zoot Suit Riot . Released at the onset of the late 1990s swing revival , Zoot Suit Riot sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit , launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo @-@ swing movement . By the end of the decade , however , the Daddies ' mainstream popularity declined with that of the swing revival 's , and the resulting commercial failure of their ska @-@ flavored follow @-@ up Soul Caddy led to an abrupt hiatus in 2000 . 
 The Daddies officially regrouped in 2002 to resume part @-@ time touring , eventually returning to recording with the independently released Susquehanna in 2008 . Their tenth and most recent album The Boop @-@ A @-@ Doo , a collection of 1920s and 1930s cover songs , was released in January 2016 .

 = = = Formation = = = 
 Following his high school graduation in 1981 , Steve Perry left his hometown of Binghamton , New York , for Eugene , Oregon , to pursue track and field and a chemistry degree at the University of Oregon . A punk rock fan since adolescence , Perry soon became engrossed in Eugene 's underground music scene , where he eventually met and befriended musician and fellow University student Dan Schmid . Sharing similar musical ambitions and a mutual disinterest in school , the pair agreed to drop out of college together and start a band , forming the punk trio The Jazz Greats in 1983 , which evolved into the Paisley Underground @-@ styled garage rock group Saint Huck , who lasted from 1984 to 1987 . 
 As the rise of grunge began to phase punk and hardcore out of the Northwest underground by the late 1980s , Perry set out to start a band that stood in defiant contrast to the shoegazing attitude of alternative rock , showcasing high energy dance music and Zappa @-@ esque theatricality in an attempt to create something that an audience would react to viscerally instead of passively . Recruiting a horn section led by alto saxophonist Brooks Brown , Perry and Schmid formed their latest band Mr. Wiggles – named after a Parliament song – in November 1988 , playing their first show in Springfield as part of a benefit concert for workers of the Nicolai door manufacturing plant , who were then engaged in a union strike . 
 " My conception of punk " , Perry told The Rocket , " was doing whatever the hell you wanted as long as it had vitality and wasn 't overly stupid ... something exploratory and experimental " , citing influence from genre @-@ bending bands such as The Clash and the Meat Puppets . In their earliest incarnation , Mr. Wiggles played punk @-@ inflected funk and soul music , though Perry 's songwriting soon grew to draw heavily from a newfound interest in jazz , swing and rhythm and blues , combining punk rock and jazz arrangements in what Perry described was a desire to contemporize American roots music by infusing it with punk energy and using modernist , socially aware lyricism . 
 = = = Early years ( 1989 – 1993 ) = = = 
 By early 1989 , the title of Mr. Wiggles had been retired as the band switched to the intentionally risqué " Cherry Poppin ' Daddies " . Derived from a jive phrase the band had heard on a vintage race record , the name intended to reflect the group 's jazz and blues influences as well as an edgy punk irreverence in the same vein as the Butthole Surfers , though the decision was ultimately made on impulse , as the members had run out of time to figure out a name to put on their posters and doubted their longevity past a handful of shows . The band played their first show as the Cherry Poppin ' Daddies at Eugene 's <unk> Hall on March 31 , 1989 . 
 Boasting a full horn section , a penchant for stage theatrics and encouraging their audiences to dance , the Daddies sought to prove themselves the antithesis to the then @-@ current state of Northwest rock . As Perry said of the Daddies ' ideology , " It was our way of saying ' screw you ' [ to alternative rock ' phoniness ' ] " ... " we wanted to have fun , outrageously have a good blast without even thinking about it " . By the end of 1989 , the Daddies had built a strong following within Eugene 's counterculture , frequently selling out shows and gathering critical acclaim , earning praise from Eugene Weekly as being the city 's best band " by far " . 
 The Daddies recorded their first demo cassette 4 From On High in July 1989 , featuring four tracks of punk @-@ tinged swing and funk rock . The tape went on to sell over 1 @,@ 000 copies in the Eugene and Portland areas , enabling the band to self @-@ produce their debut LP Ferociously Stoned the following year . Fusing punk rock and jazz horns with funk grooves , the album garnered favorable comparisons to contemporaries Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers . Before it was even officially released , Ferociously Stoned became a regional best @-@ seller , setting a record for advance sales in Eugene 's record stores and then remaining for over a year on The Rocket 's Northwest Top Twenty list , helping expand the Daddies ' touring reach to as far as Alaska and Los Angeles by 1992 .

 In addition to their unusual mix of musical styles , the Daddies became perhaps most notorious for their extravagant and often provocative stage shows . With the band donning a rotating array of flamboyant costumes , a typical Daddies performance would often feature go @-@ go dancers , phallic stage scenery , prop @-@ heavy vaudevillian skits and choreographed dance numbers . Perry — performing under the mad scientist stage persona of " MC Large Drink " — would engage in absurdist shock rock antics such as mock crucifixion , flag burning and <unk> his body with various foods and liquids . The most infamous element of the Daddies ' early stage shows , however , was the " <unk> " ( alternately " <unk> " ) , a penis @-@ shaped modified ride @-@ on lawnmower which mimicked ejaculation by shooting salvos of colorful fluids from its tip . 
 Almost immediately , the Daddies emerged a controversial presence within Eugene 's actively political atmosphere . Feminist groups condemned the band 's performances as pornographic , accusing their band name and sexually charged lyricism as promotion of sexism and misogyny , claims which Perry boldly disputed , defending the controversial elements as misinterpreted satire . In what Eugene Weekly called " the most hotly discussed topic in the local music scene " and " the Eugene flash point for the growing national debate on censorship [ and ] free speech " , the Daddies endured a storm of controversy which nearly ended their burgeoning career . Vigilante protest groups habitually tore down or defaced the band 's posters and led boycotts against venues that would book the group and even newspapers which gave them a positive review . The Daddies ' concerts regularly became sites of organized picketing and , on one occasion , a bomb threat . The band members themselves were frequent recipients of hate mail , threats and physical harassment : once , Perry claimed , an irate protester threw a cup of hot coffee in his face as he was walking down the street . 
 At first , the Daddies refused to change their name on the grounds of artistic freedom , but after venues refused to book them due to the negative publicity that naturally accompanied their shows — including a temporary ban from the <unk> Hall , where the Daddies had previously served as house band — the group caved into community pressure , taking to performing under pseudonyms such as " The Daddies " , " The Bad Daddies " and similar variations just within Eugene , retaining their full title while traveling abroad . As the Daddies advanced in their career and retired the theatrical elements from their live shows , the controversies surrounding them waned and the band returned to using their full name in their hometown , though some minor protests resurfaced during their mainstream success in the late 1990s . 
 = = = National touring and independent success ( 1994 – 1996 ) = = = 
 After numerous member changes including the departure of co @-@ founder Brown and the addition of guitarist Jason Moss , the Daddies had progressed into a full @-@ time touring band by early 1994 . Now traveling coast @-@ to @-@ coast , the band was playing upwards of 200 shows a year , including spots at festivals such as SXSW in Austin , Texas and New York 's CMJ Music Marathon . The Daddies eventually developed a steady following in the San Francisco Bay Area , where they became a staple of the region 's thriving third wave ska scene , acting as regular touring support for ska bands like Skankin ' Pickle , Let 's Go Bowling , Fishbone and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones . In 1994 , the group was awarded SF Weekly 's title of " Best Unsigned Band " . 
 While the mainstream 's growing focus on punk and ska by the mid @-@ 1990s began presenting the Daddies with commercial opportunities – leading The Register @-@ Guard to predict them as becoming the next Northwestern act " to go national " – the band chose to remain wholly independent during this time to allow themselves unlimited creative freedom , supposedly after several major contract offers ( including a brief attachment to Hollywood Records ) had been withdrawn due to the Daddies ' refusal to adhere to any one particular genre . 
 This experimental freedom was fully exercised on the Daddies ' second album , Rapid City Muscle Car . Self @-@ produced and self @-@ recorded , Rapid City Muscle Car was the band 's attempt at creating an eclectic concept album wherein each track was composed in a different musical style , yet were all thematically united through interconnected lyricism . Anchored in funk and swing , the album featured genre experiments in ska punk , psychedelic rock , country , rockabilly , big band , hard rock and lounge . Released on the band 's self @-@ operated label Space Age Bachelor Pad Records in December 1994 , the album sold decently , though failed to match the success of Ferociously Stoned . 
 Throughout the mid @-@ 1990s , the Daddies toured constantly , carrying out six cross @-@ country tours in 1996 alone following the release of their third independent album , Kids on the Street . A remarkable musical departure from their previous work , Kids on the Street was primarily a showcase of the ska influences which had gradually become a major part of the Daddies ' live sound , forgoing their usual brassy funk and swing @-@ based eclecticism in favor of guitar @-@ driven ska , rock and punk . Distributed by noted indie label Caroline Records , Kids on the Street wound up becoming the Daddies ' then @-@ most successful release , remaining on The Rocket 's Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and eventually working its way onto Rolling Stone 's Alternative Charts .

 With the breakthrough of third wave ska into the American mainstream by late 1996 , the Daddies seemed poised for commercial success , landing a spot on a well @-@ publicized national tour with popular ska bands Reel Big Fish and Let 's Go Bowling . Although the band were mainly playing ska shows at the time , they soon began drawing a sizable following for their swing material when the coincident success of the film Swingers and its featured band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy started drawing public and media attention towards the formerly underground swing revival movement . When fans regularly began approaching the band 's merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most swing , the Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their swing side , prompting the band 's manager to convince them to compile all of their swing songs onto one CD until they could afford to make a new album , using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion . The result , Zoot Suit Riot : The Swingin ' Hits of the Cherry Poppin ' Daddies , became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour , reportedly selling as many as 4 @,@ 000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors . 
 Despite the promising sales of Zoot Suit Riot , this period proved to be the most difficult of the Daddies ' career . Consistently performing to little media recognition , full @-@ time touring was becoming both a personal and financial strain , leading to frequent quitting among band members . The Daddies experienced at least fifteen line @-@ up changes from 1996 to 1997 , including the departure of original keyboardist Chris <unk> and co @-@ founder Schmid , leaving Perry and trumpeter Dana Heitman as the sole remnants of the original line @-@ up . With no label backing them , the band had trouble securing distribution and press outside of the Northwest , often being unable to get their CDs sold in cities they were touring through . Feeling they had finally hit a glass ceiling as an independent band , Perry said the Daddies were ultimately left with one of two options at this time : either sign to a label or break up . 
 In the midst of another tour together , Reel Big Fish arranged a meeting between their label Mojo Records and the Daddies in the hopes of helping the band obtain a distribution deal , negotiations of which instead led to Mojo signing the Daddies to a full recording contract . Zoot Suit Riot was licensed and reissued by Mojo and given national distribution in July 1997 , less than four months after its original release . 
 = = = = Mainstream breakthrough = = = = 
 By October 1997 , the rising popularity of swing music had contributed to the consistently steady sales of Zoot Suit Riot , persuading Mojo to issue the album 's title track as a single and distribute it among mainstream radio stations . The Daddies , who were beginning work on their next studio album , ardently protested this move , believing that a swing song would never receive major airplay and were concerned that the band would end up having to recoup the marketing costs . Mojo nevertheless persisted , and to the band 's surprise , " Zoot Suit Riot " soon found regular rotation on stations such as Los Angeles ' influential KROQ @-@ FM , helping establish swing music in the mainstream and leading to its eventual commercial breakthrough , with the Daddies at the forefront . By mid @-@ 1998 , the Daddies had emerged as one of the most successful bands of the swing revival : after climbing to number one on Billboard 's Top Heatseekers , Zoot Suit Riot became the first album of the swing revival to crack the Top 40 on the Billboard 200 , peaking at number 17 and spending an ultimate total of 53 weeks on the charts . In June 1998 , the album had sold 500 @,@ 000 copies in the United States , going on to surpass sales of 1 @.@ 4 million by August . 
 Suddenly finding themselves in hot demand , the Daddies immediately started touring again . Spending the majority of 1998 and 1999 on the road , the band were playing close to 300 shows a year , carrying out both headlining and supporting tours of the United States while traveling internationally as one of the headliners on the 1998 Warped Tour beside Rancid , NOFX and Bad Religion . By this time , the group 's touring conditions had greatly improved , thus enticing Dan Schmid – who had originally left the band due to health concerns – to return as the Daddies ' bassist at Perry 's request . 
 Although the Daddies were experiencing commercial success under the guise of swing revivalists , having been declared the " leaders " of the movement by Rolling Stone , the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism . While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands , the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia @-@ based mentality . Perry explained to Spin in July 1998 , " it 's not our mission to be a swing band . I 'm not a guy from the ' 40s . That 's why we play ska and use heavy guitars " , noting elsewhere " I can 't fully take us out of the retro classification , but we harp on the fact that we 're contemporary music " . <unk> , the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands , selecting Latin rock group <unk> and ska / soul band The <unk> as support on their first headlining U.S. tour , and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour . At one point , the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized ; said Perry , " I know there are people who come to our shows who 'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24 / 7 ... there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only . We 're trying to find the audience who 'll let us write songs and just be who we are " . 
 During the height of the Daddies ' popularity , Perry found the band 's mainstream notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life , claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public . He would later recall , " It 's a total cliché , but [ fame ] doesn 't make you happy . There 's a lot missing . Success has given people the right to yell at me on the street , but I don 't really feel like it 's given me any dignity " . Already feeling burnt out from the Daddies ' constant touring , Perry 's frustration was only exacerbated by the media 's persistent dismissal of the Daddies as a retro novelty act , though he later claimed to have felt pressured to maintain the image due to audience and media expectations . When the band began to face criticism and accusations of selling out from their Northwest fanbase , the Daddies fought to further push themselves away from their mainstream typecasting : in a 1999 interview , responding to their place in the swing scene , Perry retorted " [ we 'll ] unapologetically play ska right in the face of people who want to hear swing " . 
 Zoot Suit Riot had sold over two million copies in the United States by the time the swing revival 's mainstream popularity had declined , finally slipping off the charts in January 2000 . With their touring schedule coming to a close , the Daddies began work on their next studio album .
