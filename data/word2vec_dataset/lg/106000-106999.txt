 Richardson thought himself temperamentally unsuited to the great tragic roles , and most reviewers agreed , but to critics of several generations he was peerless in classic comedies . Kenneth Tynan judged any Falstaff against Richardson 's , which he considered " matchless " , and Gielgud judged " definitive " . Richardson , though hardly ever satisfied with his own performances , evidently believed he had done well as Falstaff . Hall and others tried hard to get him to play the part again , but referring to it he said , " Those things I 've done in which I 've succeeded a little bit , I 'd hate to do again . " 
 A leading actor of a younger generation , Albert Finney , has said that Richardson was not really an actor at all , but a magician . Miller , who interviewed a large number of Richardson 's colleagues for his 1995 biography , notes that when talking about Richardson 's acting , " magical " was a word many of them used . The Guardian judged Richardson " indisputably our most poetic actor " . For The Times , he " was ideally equipped to make an ordinary character seem extraordinary or an extraordinary one seem ordinary " . He himself touched on this dichotomy in his variously reported comments that acting was " merely the art of keeping a large group of people from coughing " or , alternatively , " dreaming to order " . 
 Tynan , who could be brutally critical when he thought Richardson miscast , nevertheless thought there was something godlike about him , " should you imagine the Almighty to be a whimsical , enigmatic magician , capable of fearful blunders , sometimes inexplicably ferocious , at other times dazzling in his innocence and <unk> " . Harold Hobson wrote , " Sir Ralph is an actor who , whatever his failure in heroic parts , however short of tragic grandeur his Othello or his Macbeth may have fallen , has nevertheless , in unromantic tweeds and provincial hats , received a revelation . There are more graceful players than he upon the stage ; there is none who has been so touched by Grace . " 
 = Battle of Halmyros = 
 The Battle of Halmyros , known by older scholars as the Battle of the Cephissus or Battle of Orchomenos , was fought on 15 March 1311 between the forces of the Frankish Duchy of Athens and its vassals under Walter of Brienne and the mercenaries of the Catalan Company , resulting in a devastating victory for the Catalans . 
 Engaged in conflict with their original employers , the Byzantine Empire , the Catalan Company had traversed the southern Balkans and arrived in southern Greece in 1309 . The new Duke of Athens , Walter of Brienne , hired them to attack the Greek ruler of neighbouring Thessaly . Although the Catalans conquered much of the region for him , Walter refused to pay them the salaries owed , and prepared to forcibly expel them from their gains . The two armies met at Halmyros in southern Thessaly ( or at the <unk> Cephissus , near Orchomenos , according to an earlier interpretation ) . The Catalans were considerably outnumbered and weakened by the reluctance of their Turkish auxiliaries to fight . The Company did have the advantage of selecting the battleground , positioning themselves behind marshy terrain , which they further inundated with water . On the Athenian side , many of the most important lords of Frankish Greece were present and Walter , a prideful man and confident in the prowess of his heavy cavalry , proceeded to charge headlong against the Catalan line . The marsh impeded the Frankish attack and the Catalan infantry stood firm . The Turks , seeing that battle was joined in earnest , re @-@ joined the Company , and the Frankish army was routed ; Walter and almost the entire knighthood of his realm fell in the field . As a result of the battle , the leaderless Duchy of Athens was taken over by the Catalans , who ruled that part of Greece until the 1380s . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1309 , the Burgundian noble Walter of Brienne was selected as the Duke of Athens in Frankish Greece after the death of Guy II de la Roche . At that time the Greek world was in turmoil owing to the actions of the Catalan Company . These were a group of mercenaries , veterans of the War of the Sicilian Vespers , originally hired by the Byzantine Empire against the Turks in Asia Minor . Soon , however , mutual suspicion and quarrels brought about an open conflict ; evicted from their base in Gallipoli in 1307 , the Catalans marched west through Thrace and Macedonia , until , pressed by Byzantine troops under <unk> , they entered Thessaly in early 1309 . 
 The arrival of the marauding Company , some 8 @,@ 000 strong , in Thessaly caused concern to the region 's Greek ruler , John II Doukas . Having just availed himself of the death of Guy II to throw off the tutelage of the Dukes of Athens , John turned to Byzantium and the other Greek principality , the state of Epirus , for aid . Defeated by the Greeks , the Catalans agreed to pass peacefully through Thessaly to the south , towards the Frankish principalities of southern Greece . Walter of Brienne , who in his youth had fought against the Catalans in Italy , spoke Catalan and had gained the Catalans ' respect , now hired the Company for six months against the Greeks , at a high price : four ounces of gold for every heavy cavalryman , two for every light cavalryman and one for every infantryman , with two months ' payment in advance . Turning back , the Catalans captured the town of Domokos and some thirty other fortresses , and plundered the rich plain of Thessaly , forcing the Greek states to come to terms with Walter . 
 The Catalans gave Walter a remarkable success , which brought him accolades and financial rewards from Pope Clement V , but the Duke now declined to fulfil his end of the deal and pay the remaining four months ' pay . Instead , Walter picked the best 200 horsemen and 300 <unk> infantry from the Company , paid them their arrears and gave them land so that they would remain in his service , while ordering the rest to hand over their conquests and depart his lands . In response , the Catalans offered to recognize him as their lord if they were allowed to keep some of the land they had taken to establish themselves , but Walter rejected their proposal and began preparations to expel them by force . To this purpose , the Duke of Athens assembled a large army , comprising his own feudatories — among them the most prominent were Albert Pallavicini , Margrave of Bodonitsa , Thomas III d 'Autremencourt , Lord of Salona and Marshal of Achaea , and the barons of Euboea , Boniface of Verona , George I Ghisi and John of Maisy — as well as reinforcements sent from the other principalities of Frankish Greece . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Three sources report in some detail on the events before and during the battle , all of them drawing on first @-@ hand Catalan accounts and reflecting the Catalan point of view : the near @-@ contemporary chronicle of Ramon Muntaner , the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea , and the account found in the history of the Byzantine writer Nikephoros Gregoras ( ca . 1359 ) . According to the Chronicle of the Morea , the Catalan army comprised 2 @,@ 000 cavalry and 4 @,@ 000 infantry , at least 1 @,@ 100 of whom were Turkish prisoners captured during their previous campaigns , and whose skill as archers they had come to value . Many of these Turks had even converted to Christianity . The sources differ on the size of Walter 's army : Gregoras reports 6 @,@ 400 cavalry and 8 @,@ 000 infantry , the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea puts it at more than 2 @,@ 000 cavalry and 4 @,@ 000 infantry , while Ramon Muntaner asserts that it comprised 700 knights and 24 @,@ 000 infantry , mostly native Greeks . Modern scholars consider these numbers to be clearly exaggerated , but they do suggest that the Athenian army had numerical superiority over the Catalans . 
 Ramon Muntaner and Gregoras place the site of the battle at the <unk> Cephissus , which resulted in the identification of the battle with that locality in older literature , including the standard history of Frankish Greece by William Miller , but also repeated in more recent works . The Chronicle of the Morea on the other hand places the battle at " Halmyros " , apparently the town of the same name in southern Thessaly . William Miller rejected this identification on the basis of the topography described by Muntaner , but the discovery of a 1327 letter by the Venetian statesman Marino Sanudo , which was not published until 1940 and which also places the battle at Halmyros , has altered the scholarly consensus , and Halmyros is now the commonly accepted site of the battle . 
 Faced with a numerically superior , but less experienced enemy , the Company assumed a defensive position , taking care to select a battleground that favoured them . They chose a naturally strong position , protected by a swamp which , according to Gregoras , they further enhanced by digging trenches and inundating them with water diverted from the nearby river . The Catalans themselves took up positions on dry ground behind the swamp , arranging themselves in a solid line , but the sources give no further details as to their exact disposition . The Athenian army on the other hand assembled at Lamia . On 10 March 1311 , Walter of Brienne composed his testament there and led his army forth . On the eve of battle , the 500 Catalans in the Duke 's service , stricken by conscience , went to him and asked for leave to rejoin their old comrades @-@ in @-@ arms , saying that they would rather die than fight against them . Walter reportedly gave them permission to leave , replying that they were welcome to die with the others . At the same time , however , the Catalans ' Turkish auxiliaries took up a separate position nearby , thinking the quarrel was a pretext arranged by the Company and the Duke of Athens to exterminate them . 
 Walter was reputed for his bravery , bordering on recklessness , and was confident of success , as evidenced by his haughty reply to the 500 mercenaries . Walter 's pride and arrogance , combined with his numerical advantage and his innate belief in the superiority of heavy noble cavalry over infantry , led him to fatally underestimate his opponent and order a charge across even such an adverse terrain . Impatient for action , according to Muntaner Walter formed a cavalry line of 200 Frankish knights " with golden spurs " , followed by the infantry , and placed himself with his banner in the vanguard . The Frankish attack failed , but the reason is unclear ; Muntaner 's description is short and provides no details , while Gregoras states that the heavy Frankish cavalry got completely stuck in the mud , with the <unk> , lightly armed with swords and darts , dispatching the knights , encumbered by their heavy armour . This is the commonly accepted version among scholars as well . The Chronicle of the Morea on the other hand implies that the battle was hard @-@ fought , which as military historian Kelly DeVries notes seems to contradict Gregoras , and that the marsh possibly simply reduced the impact of the charge instead of bogging it down entirely . What is clear is that the Catalans held , and that the Duke and most of his men fell . As the two lines clashed , the Turkish auxiliaries , reassured that this was not a ruse , descended from their camp upon the Athenian army , panicking and routing what remained of it . 
 Gregoras reports that 6 @,@ 400 cavalrymen and 8 @,@ 000 infantrymen fell in the battle , the same number he gives for Walter 's forces . According to Muntaner , 20 @,@ 000 infantrymen were killed , and only two of the seven hundred knights survived the battle , Roger Deslaur and Boniface of Verona . Like the numbers for the overall number of troops involved in the battle , these numbers are unverifiable and probably exaggerated , but they are nevertheless indicative of the scale of the Athenian defeat . In addition , other senior members of the Frankish nobility are known to have survived : Nicholas Sanudo , later Duke of the Archipelago , managed to escape the battlefield , and a few others such as Antoine le <unk> , who is known to have participated in and survived the battle , were probably captured and later ransomed . Walter 's head was severed by the Catalans , and many years later was taken to Lecce in Italy , where his son buried him in the Church of Santa Croce . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 According to DeVries , the battle was " significant and perhaps even could be defined as decisive " . Almost the entire Frankish elite of Athens and its vassal states lay dead in the field , and when the Catalans moved onto the lands of the Duchy , there was scant resistance : the Greek inhabitants of <unk> immediately and willingly surrendered their strongly fortified town , for which they were rewarded with the rights of Frankish citizens ; Thebes , the capital of the Duchy , was abandoned by many of its inhabitants , who fled to the Venetian stronghold of Negroponte , and plundered by the Catalan troops ; and finally Athens itself was surrendered to the victors by Walter 's widow , Joanna of Châtillon . The entirety of Attica and Boeotia passed peacefully into the hands of the Catalans , and only the lordship of Argos and Nauplia in the Peloponnese remained in the hands of Brienne loyalists . The Catalans ' Turkish allies however refused the offer to settle in the Duchy , and instead , taking their share of the booty , departed to return to Asia Minor , only to be attacked and almost annihilated by the joint forces of the Byzantines and the Genoese as they were trying to cross the Dardanelles a few months later . 
 Lacking a leader of stature , the Catalan Company turned to their two distinguished captives : at first they asked Boniface of Verona , whom they knew and respected , to lead them , but after he declined , they chose Roger Deslaur instead . Deslaur proved unequal to the task , however , and the hostility of Venice and the other Frankish states compelled the Catalans to seek a powerful protector . Thus they turned to Frederick II of Sicily , who appointed his son Manfred as Duke of Athens . In reality , the Duchy was governed by a succession of vicars @-@ general appointed by the Aragonese Crown , often cadet members of the Aragonese royal family . The most successful of the vicars @-@ general , Alfonso <unk> , expanded the Duchy into Thessaly , establishing the Duchy of Neopatras in 1319 . The Catalans consolidated their rule and survived a <unk> attempt to recover the Duchy in 1331 – 32 . In the 1360s , the twin duchies were plagued by internal strife , including a quasi @-@ war with Venice , and increasingly felt the threat of the Ottoman Turks , but another <unk> attempt to launch a campaign against them in 1370 – 71 came to naught . It was not until 1379 – 80 that Catalan rule faced its first major setback , when the Navarrese Company conquered Thebes and much of Boeotia . Finally , in 1386 – 88 , the ambitious lord of Corinth , <unk> I <unk> , captured Athens and claimed the Duchy for himself from the Crown of Aragon . With his capture of Neopatras in 1390 , the era of Catalan rule in Greece came to an end .

 = Give Me a Ring Sometime = 
 " Give Me a Ring Sometime " is the first episode of the American situation comedy Cheers . Written by Glen and Les Charles and directed by James Burrows , the episode first aired September 30 , 1982 on NBC . The pilot episode introduces the employees of bar Cheers : Sam Malone , Diane Chambers , Coach Ernie Pantusso , and Carla Tortelli ; and regular customers : Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin . In this episode , Diane , brought in by fiancé Sumner Sloan , meets the employees and patrons of the bar . When she realizes that her fiancé has left her alone in the bar , Diane accepts Sam 's offer to be the bar 's waitress to start over . 
 In the original script the employees were the principal characters , and Norm and Cliff were not included . Later revisions added Norm and Cliff , and scenes were restructured and rewritten . Originally , Cheers ' set would be a hotel , but it was <unk> changed to a bar . Ratings were low when the episode first aired , but were moderately successful in reruns . It has been critically praised over the years , and earned its writers awards for Best Writing in 1983 .

 As owner Sam Malone opens the bar , a professor Sumner Sloane ( Michael McGuire ) and his Boston University student fiancée Diane Chambers are the first customers . They are planning to go to Barbados to be married , but do not have a wedding ring ; Sumner leaves to get the ring from his ex @-@ wife . While she waits , Diane learns about the other people in the bar . Sam is an ex @-@ baseball player and a recovering alcoholic . Waitress Carla Tortelli is a bitter divorcée with four children . Male patrons are playing a " body sweat in movies " trivia game , which repulses Diane . Sumner returns a few hours later , suggesting Cool Hand Luke as a " sweaty " movie and telling Diane he could not get his ex @-@ wife 's ring . His ex @-@ wife calls the bar with a change of heart , and Sumner leaves Diane again . 
 Diane and Sam argue about Sumner , and Sam pointedly tells her Sumner is probably on a plane with his ex @-@ wife . Diane calls the airport to change their flight reservation , and finds out that " Mr. and Mrs. Sloane " have already used it . Heartbroken , she prepares to go home before realizing that her job as Sumner 's teaching assistant is gone . Out of pity , Sam offers her a job at Cheers as a waitress . Because of her educational background , Diane initially refuses ; however , when she remembers a number of orders ( including special requests ) from a table she reluctantly accepts the job . The following day , Diane 's first customer is an international tourist ( Erik Holland ) , asking for his lost luggage . 
 = = Casting = = 
 The pilot introduces employees of the bar , Cheers , in Boston , Massachusetts in order of appearance : 
 Sam Malone ( Ted Danson ) is a recovering alcoholic , a former baseball player , a bartender and the owner of Cheers . 
 Diane Chambers ( Shelley Long ) is a college student and " bar misfit " who is abandoned by her fiancé , Sumner Sloane . She becomes a waitress at the end of the episode . 
 Ernie Pantusso ( Nicholas Colasanto ) is a " forgetful " , " gravelly @-@ voiced bartender " , nicknamed " Coach " because he was Sam 's coach during his career as a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox . 
 Carla Tortelli ( Rhea Perlman ) is a bitter , " wisecracking , cynical waitress " and divorcée whose husband , Nick , abandons her and her four children . 
 The creators rejected the idea of casting a star such as Mary Tyler Moore , and sought actors who were previously unknown to the public . They interviewed almost 1 @,@ 000 people for the four principal roles : Sam Malone , Diane Chambers , Carla Tortelli , and " Coach " Ernie Pantusso . Steve Kolzak ( credited as Stephen Kolzak ) cast the original characters . According to Danson , Rhea Perlman was the first to be cast . Former umpire Ron Luciano auditioned for Coach ; however , the producers " wanted an experienced actor " . Robert <unk> , who later appeared as Rebecca Howe 's ( Kirstie Alley ) Navy father in the 1992 Cheers episode " Daddy 's Little Middle @-@ Aged Girl " and an author in the 1996 Frasier episode " A Crane 's Critique " , turned down the role of Coach . Actor @-@ director Nicholas Colasanto won the role . 
 Auditions were held for Sam and Diane . Three pairs were tested : William Devane and Lisa Eichhorn , Fred Dryer and Julia Duffy , and Ted Danson and Shelley Long . Before the show premiered Danson appeared in 1979 's The Onion Field ; Long appeared in 1982 's Night Shift , starring Henry Winkler of Happy Days . Fred Dryer later appeared as Dave Richards , a sportscaster friend of Sam 's , in " Sam at Eleven " in 1982 . Sam Malone was originally " a former wide receiver for the New England Patriots " , and Fred Dryer was considered for the role because he was a football player . However , NBC executives liked test scenes with Danson and Long so the creators chose them instead , making Sam a former relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox . Ed O 'Neill also auditioned for the role of Sam Malone . 
 We had some surprises . Some actors were terrific by themselves but not in concert with others . Each actor read the same scene . Everyone got the same chance . We were looking for actors who could make us laugh by being loyal to the characters . Then we matched them up . 
 Two customers were introduced : 
 Norm Peterson ( George Wendt ) , recognized by everyone in the bar , enters for a quick drink . 
 Cliff Clavin ( John Ratzenberger ) appears for a conversation with other male patrons about bar trivia . 
 George Wendt and John Ratzenberger originally auditioned for the role of " George " , and Wendt was cast . In the original script , George was Diane 's first customer at the end of the episode . Annoyed with Diane 's long @-@ winded explanation of how she became a waitress , he delivered his one @-@ word line : " Beer ! " After Wendt was cast , the writers revised the script ; his role evolved into Norm Peterson , the first onscreen customer to enter the bar and " [ <unk> ] Diane rather than the other way around " . After Wendt was cast , Ratzenberger suggested to the producers that a know @-@ it @-@ all character be added ; this led to the creation of another character , Cliff Clavin . 
 One character who was cut from the pilot episode was an unpleasant , racist , wheelchair @-@ bound old woman named Mrs. Littlefield , supposedly a regular customer of Cheers , who was intended to be a recurring character . Her lines were filmed as part of a rough cut of the pilot . However , the producers decided to cut the character out of the episode , as they found her character did not mesh with other characters or with the overall tone of the show . Nevertheless , the uncredited actress who played her can still be seen as a background performer in a few scenes . Some sources credit this actress as Elaine <unk> , although the unidentified actress who is still seen on camera looks nothing like Stritch . In answer to a question about the actress , Cheers writer / producer Ken Levine has stated on his blog " that was not Elaine Stritch " The producers ultimately decided to eliminate Mrs. Littlefield completely from the show from that point forward , necessitating changes to some yet @-@ to @-@ be @-@ filmed scripts for the first few episodes . 
 Three other bar patrons have speaking roles in the completed episode : John P. Navin , Jr. portrays a teenage boy in the cold open , Erik Holland has a brief bit as Diane 's first customer , and Ron Frazier appears as a <unk> who stands at the bar near Cliff ( and who offers " Ben Hur " as his choice for the <unk> movie ever made . ) 
 = = Production = = 
 The creators of Cheers ( and the crew of Taxi ) , co @-@ writers Glen and Les Charles and director James Burrows , created a sitcom project in 1981 . Initially set in a hotel , the setting changed to a hotel bar and finally a " Boston neighborhood bar " . The show was filmed not in a pub , but on Stage 25 of the Paramount Studios lot . Cheers ' set was inspired by the Bull & Finch Pub in Boston , now known as Cheers Beacon Hill ( pictured , right ) . A Boston bar was chosen because of its " interior [ made out of ] brick , polished mahogany , and brass " ; the city was chosen because it is " cosmopolitan " , " a great sports town " and was not previously explored on television . Because the creators are sports fans , an athletic element was added to the bar . Burrows said that the show was intended to be about a bar which people visit for more than drinks . 
 Jokes from earlier scripts were used . In one scene , Carla Tortelli orders a phone caller to do something about their unruly children . When one of the bartenders suggests hiring a babysitter , Carla replied that the caller was the babysitter . The cast did not know the ending of the pilot episode during production , since the final draft of the script was dated April 16 , 1982 .

 When the episode originally aired in 1982 , Fred Rothenberg of the Associated Press called it an introduction to a " new wise @-@ cracking comedy " , " a warm and wacky companion of a television show , a delightful place to spend idle time , [ and ] a five @-@ star watering hole " known as Cheers . Television and radio critic Mike Drew said it was not great but " funnier [ ... ] with cute lines [ ... ] than " any other sitcom , even those ( like Archie Bunker 's Place on TV and Duffy 's Tavern on radio ) set in bars . Fred L. Smith of The News and Courier found this episode similar to Taxi : " Both are set in a place of business − Cheers at a [ Boston bar ] , Taxi at a [ New York taxi company ] — both have a sensible guy and a pretty , preppy girl as main characters — Ted Danson and Shelley Long in Cheers and Judd Hirsch and <unk> Henner in Taxi — and both are wacky comedies . " He found it " amusing " ; some jokes , funny ; many others , forced ; and the number of " weird characters " in the show greater than their real @-@ life bar counterparts . 
 In 2009 , Lex Walker on the Just Press Play website found this episode " sadder and more sentimental " than funny ; the episode focuses " less on character development and more on " Diane restarting her life as a waitress after the loss of love , and he said it contradicts " what [ Cheers ] will grow to be " . Nevertheless , he called the episode a true introduction to the series and considered the intertwining stories of Sam and his friends the series ' premise . In 2010 , Robin Raven from Yahoo ! Voices called it one of her top five Cheers episodes . In 2011 , Austin Lugar from The Film Yap website called it the " best " . IGN ranked it number nine of the top ten Cheers episodes .

 = SS Kommandøren = 
 SS Kommandøren was a steel @-@ hulled passenger / cargo steamship built in Norway in 1891 . She served as a communications link between the regional capital of Western Norway , Bergen , and the various communities of Sogn og Fjordane county . 
 Following the 9 April 1940 German invasion of Norway , she was requisitioned by the Norwegian authorities and carried troops for the Norwegian war effort until the forces in Western Norway ceased fighting on 2 May 1940 . 
 After a brief stint in German service , she returned to her civilian duties later in 1940 , and was accidentally torpedoed and sunk by a German E @-@ boat in Bergen on 29 March 1945 . 
 = = Construction and characteristics = = 
 Kommandøren was one of four passenger / cargo steamships built for Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe at Norwegian shipyards around the turn of the 20th century . The four ships were constructed to supplement four smaller vessels built decades earlier at British shipyards . In addition to Kommandøren , which was seen as the flagship of the company 's fleet , Lærdal , Balder and <unk> were built between 1876 and 1904 . The company sailed on cargo / passenger routes in Western Norway . Kommandøren was the largest of the new @-@ builds , and was considered the grandest of the company vessels . 
 Delivered on 30 June 1891 , Kommandøren was yard number 132 at Akers Mekaniske Værksted in Kristiania ( modern @-@ day Oslo ) , Norway . The steel @-@ hulled ship measured 433 gross register tons ( GRT ) , had a length of 50 @.@ 8 metres ( 167 ft ) , a beam of 7 @.@ 5 metres ( 25 ft ) and a draught of 3 @.@ 9 metres ( 13 ft ) . Her 600 indicated horsepower / 116 nominal horsepower 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion steam engine could propel the ship at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . Kommandøren cost the company NOK 264 @,@ 000 to build and could take up to 249 passengers . 
 Although much newer than the first ships operated by Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe , Kommandøren and the three other ships were only around 2 knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 2 @.@ 3 mph ) faster than the mid @-@ 19th century vessels used by the company . 
 The new ship was named Kommandøren by Nordre Bergenhus <unk> county council , after the affectionate nickname of the county 's shipping company 's first executive director , Hugo <unk> , who had held the rank of <unk> ( English : commander ) in the Royal Norwegian Navy . To name the new ship after the executive director was an unusual decision , as most Norwegian ships of the era were named after place names , historical figures or royalty . 
 Built not only to carry people and cargo between the towns and villages of Western Norway , but also for the tourist trade , Kommandøren was fitted with a comparatively luxurious first class section . The 10 @-@ cabin , 36 @-@ bed , first class featured a smoking salon , a women 's salon and a dining salon for the first class passengers and ship officers . A promenade deck gave views in all directions . The third class passengers had two salons , one on the main deck and one on the orlop ( lowest ) deck . On Kommandøren , the third class section was expanded and improved in comparison with earlier vessels , after complaints from passengers to the county council . The third class section of Kommandøren was described by the newspaper <unk> Tidende as " large , spacious and almost comfortably equipped . Kommandøren was home ported in Bergen . She had her maiden passenger voyage from Bergen to Sogn on 5 July 1891 . 
 = = Passenger / cargo and tourist service = = 
 In the summer season , Kommandøren served the tourist trade in Sogn , while she sailed the regular passenger / cargo routes during the winter months . Kommandøren was generally used as an express route ship , often carrying patients on their way to treatment . Amongst the cargo carried by was often live animals , including horses , cattle and sheep . During one of her trips , Kommandøren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near <unk> in Balestrand . The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region , like she did in September 1920 , when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project . Shortly after delivery , in September 1892 , Kommandøren provided transport support to a large @-@ scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway . She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to <unk> after the completion of the exercises . 
 In 1910 , Kommandøren was modernized at Stavanger <unk> & Dok in Stavanger , gaining a new boiler for the steam engine and being painted white . In January the next year , she ran aground at <unk> in the <unk> . She ran aground again in 1913 , in <unk> , and again in <unk> off <unk> in 1928 . 
 A rebuild in 1922 saw the ship 's well deck built over , creating a flush deck profile . In 1930 the ship was refurbished and modernized . By this time , Kommandøren measured 543 GRT and 315 NRT . 
 Kommandøren ran aground yet again in April 1938 , when she ran into the island <unk> while en route from <unk> to <unk> . The incident caused severe damage to the bottom of the hull .

 When Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany on 9 April , Kommandøren was not in the areas immediately captured by the invading Germans . She was thus able to continue her service in the Sognefjord for much of the month of April 1940 . On 9 April 1940 , Kommandøren was en route to Bergen , but was stopped at <unk> and ordered to Sogn to assist in the mobilization of Norwegian Army units to oppose the Germans . 
 Kommandøren was directed to transport troops from <unk> via several smaller villages to <unk> and Gudvangen . Together with the steamer Gudvangen , she set out in the early morning of 10 April to retrieve troops . Kommandøren and the other ships of the company fleet were later praised by the regional police commander for their important role in the successful mobilization in Sogn og Fjordane .

 On 25 April 1940 , Kommandøren steamed in the Sognefjord , carrying regular passengers , as well as a load of around 100 soldiers bound for Gudvangen and Voss for service with the Norwegian Army 's 4th Division . The soldiers brought in that day belonged to an older age group not called up in the initial mobilization drive . While en route from Vik to Balestrand , the steamer was bombed and strafed by a German bomber . The bombs did not hit the ship , and the machine gun bullets only did minor damage and caused no casualties . 
 After calling at Balestrand , Kommandøren proceeded to <unk> , where the soldiers on board disembarked . While Kommandøren was docked at <unk> , the village was attacked by a German aircraft . The aircraft dropped 11 bombs in three series on the area , before strafing people and cars on the ground . Amongst the targets were the soldiers unloaded by Kommandøren , the troops being on the march to nearby <unk> . The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright , and wounded a 16 @-@ year @-@ old local boy and the boy 's mother , restaurateur Isak <unk> from Kommandøren and the ship 's captain , Thorvald Johannessen . While on the way to hospital in Lærdal with Kommandøren , Captain Johannessen died from his wounds .

 For the remaining week of the fighting in South Norway , Kommandøren was docked at <unk> , immobilized by a damaged axle . As part of the ceasefire agreement accepted by the Norwegians in Western Norway in the evening of 1 May 1940 , Kommandøren was to be handed over to the Germans , along with the ferry Lærdal and 40 smaller boats . The transfer of the ships occurred at Lærdal on 2 May , and the ceasefire was announced on 3 May . The Germans used Kommandøren and the other vessels for a limited period to transport troops to occupy various places in Western Norway . When released by the Germans , Kommandøren was repaired before re @-@ entering service .

 By the autumn of 1940 , Kommandøren was back in regular service , providing an important link between Bergen and the smaller town and villages in the region . By 1944 , Kommandøren had been assigned the code letters LEGO . 
 She remained in service until 8 February 1945 , when she ran aground in the <unk> narrows . Kommandøren remained aground for five weeks , and was filled by sea water before being salvaged and towed to Bergen to await repairs . Although the ship 's hull was intact , the interior and engine were heavily water damaged .

 During the night of 29 March 1945 , Kommandøren was docked at the remains of Søndre <unk> in Bergen . At around 01 : 00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat anchored on the opposite side of Vågen bay . The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandøren over a wide area , and left the ship lying on the harbour bed . Only the mast and a section of the bow remained above water . The midship and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo . The only crew member on board at the time , Able Seaman Alf Larsen , was killed in the incident . 
 Before discovering that the incident had been caused by the accidental launch of two torpedoes by a drunken German crewman on the E @-@ boat S @-@ 13 , the German authorities in Bergen launched a search for saboteurs in the city . Kommandøren was the only total loss suffered by <unk> i Sogn og Fjordane ( the formerly named Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe ) during the Second World War . 
 The wreck of Kommandøren was raised in April 1946 and towed to <unk> in Askøy . Kommandøren was sold for scrap in November 1946 . 
 = Warren County , Indiana = 
 Warren County lies in western Indiana between the Illinois state line and the Wabash River in the United States . According to the 2010 census , the population was 8 @,@ 508 . The county seat is Williamsport . 
 Before the arrival of non @-@ indigenous settlers in the early 19th century , the area was inhabited by several Native American tribes . The county was officially established in 1827 and was the 55th county to be formed in Indiana . 
 It is one of the most rural counties in the state , with the third @-@ smallest population and the lowest population density at about 23 inhabitants per square mile ( 8 @.@ 9 / km2 ) . The county has four incorporated towns with a total population of about 3 @,@ 100 , as well as many small unincorporated communities . The county is divided into 12 townships which provide local services . 
 Much of the land in the county is given over to agriculture , especially on the open prairie in the northern and western parts ; the county 's farmland is among the most productive in the state . Nearer the river along the southeastern border , the land has many hills , valleys , and tributary streams and is more heavily wooded . Agriculture , manufacturing , government , education , and health care each provide substantial portions of the jobs in the county . Four Indiana state roads cross the county , as do two U.S. Routes and one major railroad line . 
 = = History = = 
 In the centuries before the arrival of European settlers , the area that became Warren County was on the boundary between the Miami and Kickapoo tribes . By the late 18th century , many Miami had moved further south ; most of Indiana north of the Wabash was then occupied by the Potawatomi people . The first non @-@ indigenous settler in the area was probably Zachariah Cicott , a French @-@ Canadian who first traded with the Kickapoo and Potawatomi people around 1802 . When General William Henry Harrison took an army from Vincennes to the Battle of Tippecanoe in late 1811 , Cicott served as a scout ; the trail taken by Harrison 's army passed through the area that later became Warren County on its way to and from the battle site in Tippecanoe County . Following the War of 1812 , Cicott resumed his trading on the Wabash ; the state of Indiana was established in 1816 , and Cicott built a log house in 1817 at the location where he later founded the town of Independence . Other settlers came to the area , but probably not until around 1822 . 
 The county was established on March 1 , 1827 , by the Indiana General Assembly . It was named for Dr. Joseph Warren , who was killed in 1775 at the Battle of Bunker Hill , in which he fought as a private because his commission as a general had not yet taken effect . The short @-@ lived town of Warrenton was the original Warren County seat , chosen by commissioners in March 1828 ; the next year an act was passed calling for the seat to be relocated , and in June 1829 it was moved to Williamsport . 
 The first county courthouse was a log house in Warrenton that belonged to ( and was occupied by ) Enoch Farmer , one of the county 's earliest settlers . When the county seat moved to Williamsport , a log house belonging to the town 's founder , William Harrison , served this purpose for several years . The first purpose @-@ built courthouse was completed in 1835 at a cost of $ 2 @,@ 000 ; in 1872 , it was replaced with a new building that cost $ 48 @,@ 000 . The third courthouse was built in 1886 , in a new section of town that grew around the newly constructed railroad . That building burned in 1907 , and the fourth and current Warren County courthouse was completed on the same site in 1908 at a cost of $ 115 @,@ 000 . 
 As the 19th century progressed , the United States government 's Indian removal policy pushed Native American tribes west of the Mississippi River . In 1830 , the Indian Removal Act was signed into law , and though that act did not directly address the Potawatomi people of Indiana , it led to several additional treaties that resulted in their removal . In what came to be known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death , about 860 Potawatomi Indians who had refused to leave were forced to move from Indiana to Kansas . On September 14 , 1838 , the group camped near Williamsport , and on September 15 they camped in the southwestern part of the county before moving into Illinois . Before reaching their destination in Kansas , over 40 of them had died , many of them children ; two children died and were buried at the second Warren County campsite . 
 When the county was established , the Wabash River was vital to transportation and shipping . Zachariah Cicott traded up and down the river , and cities like Attica , <unk> , Baltimore and Williamsport were founded near the river 's banks and flourished because of it . In the 1840s , the Wabash and Erie Canal began to operate and provided even broader shipping opportunities , but the canal favored towns which were on the " right side " of the river ; the canal was on the Fountain County side , and towns like Baltimore dwindled as a result . Some towns , such as Williamsport and <unk> , managed to participate in canal traffic through the use of side @-@ cuts that brought traffic from the canal across the river . When railroads were constructed starting in the 1850s , they in turn began to render the canals obsolete and allowed trade to reach towns that lacked water connections . The canal continued to be used through the early 1870s . 
 The first trains to run in Warren County operated on portions of the Toledo , Wabash and Western Railway ( later the Wabash Railroad ) in 1856 . The railroad entered the county near Williamsport and was built westward , reaching the western border at State Line City by 1857 . West Lebanon was the only other settlement near the railroad 's path , but the line bypassed it by about a mile ; the town subsequently moved northward to be nearer the station . In 1869 the Indianapolis , Bloomington and Western Railway was built across Mound Township in the southern part of the county . A few years later , in 1872 , a branch of the Chicago , Danville and Vincennes Railroad ( known as the " Pumpkin Vine Railroad " ) was built from Bismarck , Illinois , southeast through Warren County ; it was built specifically to carry coal from the mines south of Covington . A labor riot at the mines in the late 1870s interrupted the flow of coal , and this combined with the poor financial state of the railroad led to the removal of most of the track by 1880 ; the remaining portion was removed a few years later . At about this time , in the early 1880s , the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railroad began operating a north – south line through the county . It became part of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad but was abandoned in 1920 due to financial difficulties ; a new company operated the line as the Chicago , Attica and Southern Railroad starting in 1921 , but financial problems affected the new company as well and the rails were removed in 1946 . Another line , part of the New York Central Railroad , was built through the area in 1903 ; locally , it ran northeast from Danville into Warren County , then turned north through the small towns of Sloan and Stewart and continued north into Benton County . In the 1970s it became part of Penn Central , then Conrail ; operations on the line ceased in the 1990s and the tracks were removed , though a portion running north from Stewart remained and became the Bee Line Railroad which serves the grain processing facility in Stewart . 
 The Wabash Cannonball was a passenger train that ran on the Wabash Railroad between Detroit , Michigan and Saint Louis , Missouri , starting in 1949 . On September 19 , 1964 , the southbound Cannonball struck a truck loaded with concrete blocks at a crossing in Johnsonville . The driver of the truck was killed instantly , but although the train derailed , no other lives were lost . On the train , the driver and fireman were severely injured when the engine caught fire , and about half of the 50 passengers were injured . Over 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) of track was torn out , and the damage was estimated at over $ 500 @,@ 000 . The last run of the Cannonball was in 1969 . 
 After peaking in the late 19th century , the county 's population declined during the 20th , in common with much of the rural Midwest . The widespread adoption of the automobile in the 1920s undercut small @-@ town businesses , which were threatened further by the Great Depression of the 1930s . World War II and the economic revival of the late 1940s and 1950s drew people to better jobs in growing regional cities , and this further diminished small towns . The population shrank again in the 1980s due largely to the effects of the " farm crisis " of low crop prices , high farmer debt and other economic causes . 
 The first county fair involved both Fountain and Warren counties and was held in Independence on September 6 and 7 , 1853 . In following years , the fair was held in Fountain County , and participation by Warren County farmers diminished . In 1856 , farmers in the northern part of the county held a fair just east of Pine Village , and this continued each year through 1864 . West Lebanon became the next site of the county fair , and it ran successfully through 1883 ; the fairgrounds just to the northwest of town were well @-@ developed . Later , the fair was held at the county seat of Williamsport , and this continues through the present day ; it is now a 4H fair . 
 One location in the county , near the small town of Kramer , once had an international reputation : the Hotel <unk> . Built in 1890 at a cost of $ 250 @,@ 000 , it drew guests from around the world to nearby natural springs that were said to have healing qualities . People such as James Whitcomb Riley , John L. Sullivan and Harry Lauder are known to have stayed at the hotel , which burned down in 1920 . Later , water from the springs was bottled and sold by Indianapolis @-@ based Cameron Springs company , which was acquired by the Perrier Group of America in 2000 for about $ 10 @.@ 5 million . As of 2008 the water was still being sold and was marketed under a variety of names . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Wabash River , coming out of Tippecanoe County to the east , defines the southeastern border of the county ; the terrain here is hilly and wooded areas are common . Fountain County lies across the river . By contrast , the northwest region consists mainly of flat prairie farmland ; this continues in Benton County to the north . Along the western side of the county is the border with Vermilion County , Illinois . The small southern border is shared with the north end of the similarly named Indiana county of Vermillion . The state capital of Indianapolis lies about 70 miles ( 110 km ) to the southeast . 
 The highest free @-@ falling waterfall in the state , Williamsport Falls , is located in downtown Williamsport ; a stream named Fall Creek flows through the town and falls 90 feet ( 27 m ) over a sandstone ledge less than 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) from the county courthouse . Northeast of Independence is the Black Rock Barrens Nature Preserve , a rare siltstone glade area that , with the adjacent Weiler @-@ Leopold Nature Reserve , supports a diversity of flora including sessile trillium , <unk> and wild hyacinth in the moist lowlands and serviceberry , rue anemone , <unk> violet and yellow <unk> on the drier slopes . Big Pine Creek is the county 's largest waterway after the Wabash River , and 10 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 16 @.@ 9 km ) segment of it is designated by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources as a state natural and scenic river and passes near Fall Creek Gorge Nature Preserve , an area of cascades and potholes . 
 According to the 2010 census , the county has a total area of 366 @.@ 40 square miles ( 949 @.@ 0 km2 ) , of which 364 @.@ 68 square miles ( 944 @.@ 5 km2 ) ( or 99 @.@ 53 % ) is land and 1 @.@ 72 square miles ( 4 @.@ 5 km2 ) ( or 0 @.@ 47 % ) is water . Elevations in the county range from 480 feet ( 150 m ) above sea level where the Wabash River enters Vermillion County to 830 feet ( 250 m ) in northeastern Prairie Township . The landscape consists mostly of flat or gently sloping moraine overlaying silty and loamy glacial till , except along the Wabash River where sand , gravel , sandstone and shale are exposed . Various forms of silt loam constitute most of the county 's soil and are conducive to agriculture . Forests cover about 14 % of the county , mainly around major waterways , and consist principally of deciduous hardwoods among which maple – beech and oak – hickory forests are the most common . The only coal mines in the county are located in the southeastern part of Steuben Township , near the Wabash River . 
 When the county was formed in 1827 , it was divided into four townships : Medina , Warren , Pike and Mound . Over the following decades , many changes were made to the township borders and eight new townships were created . Pine and Washington were the first of these , in March 1830 ; Steuben followed in 1834 . Liberty was formed in 1843 , Adams in 1848 , then Jordan in 1850 . Kent and Prairie were the last to be created , in 1864 . As of 2010 , Prairie Township , at 5 @.@ 4 inhabitants per square mile ( 2 @.@ 1 / km2 ) , has the lowest population density ; it covers more area than any of the other townships — nearly 50 square miles ( 130 km2 ) — and contains no incorporated towns . The highest density is in Washington Township , which has 120 inhabitants per square mile ( 46 / km2 ) ; it includes Williamsport , the county 's largest town , and covers only about 20 square miles ( 52 km2 ) . 
 There are four incorporated towns in the county . The largest is Williamsport , which is on the western banks of the Wabash River in the eastern part of the county , just downstream of Attica ( which is on the east side of the river in Fountain County ) ; in 2010 , its population was 1 @,@ 898 — nearly one @-@ fourth of the county 's total . West Lebanon is about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) west of Williamsport on State Road 28 , with a population of 723 . The town of Pine Village lies about 11 miles ( 18 km ) to the north of Williamsport where State Road 55 intersects State Road 26 , near the northern edge of the county ; 217 people live in Pine Village . State Line City is in the southwestern part of the county and shares its western border with the Illinois state line . A small Illinois community named <unk> lies immediately on the west side of the county road which runs along the state border ( and which is also a street between the two communities ) . State Line City is the smallest of the towns , with a population of 143 . 
 In addition to the incorporated towns , there are over a dozen small unincorporated communities in Warren County that are historical centers of activity . Now they consist mostly of dwellings , though several have churches and some still have small businesses . The small settlements of Hedrick , Pence and Stewart are in Jordan Township ; Stewart consists of a grain processing facility and a single residence . In Steuben Township , Johnsonville has a church and a handful of residences . Marshfield has an automotive body repair shop , a grain elevator and a church . Independence , platted in 1832 , is located on the site of a trading post set up by Zachariah Cicott . He is buried in a cemetery in Warren Township , just north of town . The township included the small settlement of Winthrop . Liberty Township has three unincorporated communities : Carbondale , <unk> and Kramer ( near the site of the <unk> Hotel ) . Several townships contain only a single settlement . Foster is the only one in Mound Township and has a motel and several houses . In the northeast corner of the county , Green Hill is Medina Township 's only settlement . Tab is the only settlement in Prairie Township ; most of this township is agricultural , and a large grain processing facility is Tab 's only remaining business . Pine Township 's only community is <unk> . 
 Some settlements did not survive . The river town of Baltimore thrived and was a major center of trade until the river was overshadowed by the railroad for purposes of trade and transportation ; a single house , built long after the town 's heyday , is all that remains . Warrenton had a promising start as the first county seat , but it began to wane after the seat moved , and today no trace is left . Chesapeake was the first settlement in Steuben Township , but it faded away so early that even an 1883 county history has little to say on the subject . Brisco was never large , though it did have a school house from the 1850s through the 1920s . It likewise disappeared by the end of the 20th century . Chatterton had a school , a store and a post office , but it has disappeared even though the name continues to appear on maps . Other communities were planned but did not develop . Dresser was never much more than a collection of houses , though it did have a post office for a few years around the turn of the 20th century . The settlements of Kickapoo , Locust Grove , Sloan and Walnut Grove were similar in this respect . Point Pleasant never developed much beyond the founder 's residence and a liquor store , and was later described as a " paper town " .

 Warren County is in the humid continental climate region of the United States , as is most of Indiana . Its Köppen climate classification is Dfa , meaning that it is cold , has no dry season , and has a hot summer . From 1971 to 2000 , average temperatures in Indiana have ranged from a low of 26 ° F ( − 3 ° C ) in January to a high of 74 @.@ 3 ° F ( 23 @.@ 5 ° C ) in July , although a record low of − 33 ° F ( − 36 ° C ) was recorded in 1887 and a record high of 116 ° F ( 47 ° C ) was recorded in 1936 . Average monthly precipitation has ranged from 2 @.@ 27 inches ( 58 mm ) inches in February to 4 @.@ 46 inches ( 113 mm ) inches in May . 
 On April 17 , 1922 , a tornado touched down in Warren County . The town of Hedrick in southern Jordan Township was almost entirely destroyed , along with other buildings in the vicinity of the town , and several people were killed . From 1950 through 2009 , ten tornadoes were reported in Warren County ; none resulted in any deaths or injuries , but the total estimated property damage was over $ 3 million . 
 Warren County was affected by the Great Blizzard of 1978 which covered several states and was the worst blizzard on record for Indiana ; in late January , a record of snowfall of over 20 inches ( 51 cm ) fell locally , and high winds resulted in snowdrifts as high as 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . Local schools were closed for up to seventeen days , and some residents were snowbound for as many as five days . 
 = = Transportation = = 
 There are no interstate highways in Warren County , although Interstate 74 passes less than half a mile ( 800 m ) from the southern border . About 20 miles ( 32 km ) of federal highways and 86 miles ( 138 km ) of state highways cross the county , as do about 550 miles ( 890 km ) of county roads . Of these , roughly a third are paved and the rest are topped with crushed gravel or packed dirt . 
 U.S. Route 41 enters from Benton County to the north and runs through the center of Warren County , veering to the east and crossing the Wabash River between Williamsport and Attica before continuing south . U.S. Route 136 passes through the far southern part of the county on its route between Covington and Danville , Illinois . 
 In the northern part of the county , Indiana State Road 26 begins at the Illinois border and passes through the town of Pine Village , where it intersects State Road 55 on its way from Oxford in the north to Attica in the south ; State Road 26 continues east through Lafayette and on to the Ohio border . Likewise , State Road 28 runs across the state from Illinois to Ohio ; it connects West Lebanon with Williamsport and continues east through Attica . 
 The four @-@ lane divided State Road 63 runs south from its northern terminus at U.S. Route 41 near the center of the county ; both reach Terre Haute about 60 miles ( 97 km ) to the south , but while Route 41 crosses to the east side of the river , State Road 63 remains on the west side . Construction on the current State Road 63 , which replaced the older two @-@ lane road and streamlined its route , began in the late 1960s and was completed by the early 1980s . The current two @-@ lane State Road 263 is a part of the original route of State Road 63 and forms a 13 @-@ mile ( 21 km ) business route that leaves its parent route , passes through West Lebanon and along the river , then rejoins its parent near the south edge of the county . A small portion of State Road 352 lies in the far northwestern corner of the county , following the county and state border north from State Road 26 for only about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) before leaving Warren County and entering Benton County on its way through the small town of <unk> . 
 A Norfolk Southern Railway route connecting Danville , Illinois , with the city of Lafayette is the county 's busiest rail line , carrying about 45 freight trains each day . It enters Warren County at State Line City and passes northeast through the communities of Johnsonville , Marshfield , West Lebanon and Williamsport before exiting the county at Attica . Two short @-@ line railroads operate less frequently . The Bee Line Railroad is used principally for agricultural transportation and runs approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Stewart north through Tab and into southern Benton County where it joins the Kankakee , <unk> and Southern . The 6 @-@ mile ( 10 km ) Vermilion Valley Railroad serves the Flex @-@ N @-@ Gate factory near Covington and runs west from the plant through the town of Foster to meet a CSX line in Danville . 
 The nearest airport is the small Vermilion Regional Airport , located 4 nautical miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ; 4 @.@ 6 mi ) northeast of Danville , Illinois . Purdue University Airport is Indiana 's second busiest airport and is operated by Purdue University in neighboring Tippecanoe County to the northeast . Indianapolis International Airport is located about 90 miles ( 140 km ) to the southeast .

 Warren County 's economy is supported by a labor force of approximately 4 @,@ 815 workers with an unemployment rate in July 2010 of 8 @.@ 8 % . Farming is a significant part of the economy , employing approximately 14 % of the county 's workers and supporting grain elevators in most towns . In some cases , the elevator is the town 's only formal business . The county 's farmland is highly productive and is among the top 10 % of Indiana counties in terms of crop yield per acre . In 2009 , 94 @,@ 700 acres ( 38 @,@ 300 ha ) of corn was planted and 93 @,@ 100 acres ( 37 @,@ 700 ha ) acres harvested , yielding an average of 187 bushels per acre ( 11 @.@ 7 metric tons per hectare ) for a total corn production of 17 @.@ 4 million bushels ( 441 @,@ 980 metric tons ) .

Farmers also grew small amounts of hay ( 3 @,@ 700 acres ( 1 @,@ 500 ha ) ) and winter wheat , and held 3 @,@ 600 head of cattle . Roughly 86 % of the county 's 234 @,@ 413 acres ( 94 @,@ 864 ha ) is cropland . 
 About 14 % of the labor force works in the government sector for state and county services and schools ; in the non @-@ government sector , manufacturing is the largest industry at about 17 % of the labor force . The county has several industrial employers . Flex @-@ N @-@ Gate , an automobile parts assembly and warehouse facility , occupies the 750 @-@ acre ( 300 ha ) former Olin factory complex west of Covington . In Williamsport , industry includes TMF Center , which manufactures parts for construction equipment and trucking ; GL Technologies , which procures industrial tooling ; and Kuri @-@ Tec , which manufactures industrial hoses and accessories . Tru @-@ Flex Metal Hose in West Lebanon has made <unk> and corrugated flexible metal hose since 1962 ; Dyna @-@ Fab , also in West Lebanon , specializes in metal stampings and <unk> . St. Vincent Hospital and a nursing home in Williamsport are also important local employers ; 9 @.@ 8 % of the county 's jobs relate to health care and social services . 
 Larger local economies in the more populous counties to the east and west offer additional employment and commerce , particularly in the cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette in Tippecanoe County and the city of Danville in Vermilion County , Illinois .

 = 2011 Cofidis season = 
 The 2011 season for the Cofidis cycling team began in January at the Grand Prix d 'Ouverture La Marseillaise and ended in October at Paris – Tours . Cofidis was a UCI Professional Continental team in 2011 , meaning they had to be proactively selected by the organizers of UCI World Tour events , including each of the season 's Grand Tours , if they were to compete . 
 The team 's most successful rider in 2011 was David Moncoutié . The veteran Frenchman won the Tour Méditerranéen and Tour de l 'Ain overall crowns , as well as successes in the Vuelta a España . Moncoutié took a stage win and the King of the Mountains , each for the fourth straight year ( a new record for the mountains title ) . Sprinter Samuel Dumoulin was also a prolific winner , winning six races .

 The team was active in races which preceded those known as " classics " and the traditional start of the spring season . At the Grand Prix d 'Ouverture la Marseillaise , held in January as the first race of the season in France , El Fares rode to tenth place by finishing in the main field behind the solo winner . In February , Gallopin was the team 's best finisher at two of the races in the Vuelta a Mallorca series , coming ninth at the unofficial Trofeo Palma de Mallorca and tenth at the Trofeo Inca .

 Duque took a high placing at the Gran Premio dell <unk> @-@ Lugano , finishing just off the podium in fourth place , coming home in a group that trailed two leading riders . At Kuurne – Brussels – Kuurne , a race which included most of the sport 's top teams , Petit finished ninth in a field sprint finish at the front of the race . Ista narrowly missed out on a victory at Le Samyn in early March . The race 's top finishers came across the finish line scattered , in groups of eight or fewer . Ista finished second , alone , 8 seconds back of solo winner Dominic Klemme . Two weeks later , <unk> finished fourth in a sprint at <unk> <unk> . Gallopin finished on the podium at Cholet @-@ Pays de Loire . Team Europcar 's Thomas Voeckler won the race with a late attack , with the peloton coming so close to catching him at the finish line that there was no time gap . Gallopin was first from the peloton for second overall . Vogondy rode to fourth place at the Route Adélie de Vitré , just missing the podium after figuring into a winning breakaway . 
 The team picked up their first single @-@ day win the same day as the more prestigious Tour of Flanders , in which they participated but were not especially competitive , with Duque in 19th their best finisher . The race they won was the inaugural Flèche d <unk> , a new race in the UCI Europe Tour and the French Road Cycling Cup . Gallopin came first at the head of a field sprint in Saint @-@ Malo . <unk> figured into a winning breakaway at the Brabantse Pijl , the precursor to the Ardennes classics . He took seventh place , a minute and a half back of the winner Philippe Gilbert . Vogondy was sixth at the Tour du Finistère , finishing with a big main group behind two leaders . 
 Demaret took the team 's second single @-@ day win at the Tartu GP in late May . He was the best of a five @-@ rider breakaway at the front of the race , one which included teammate Taaramäe . That same day , Gallopin took sixth in a sprint finish to the Grand Prix de <unk> @-@ Morbihan . The team 's last race of the early season was Halle – <unk> in June , where Sijmens rode to ninth place . 
 The team was not especially competitive at the spring season 's monument classics , coming in 37th at Milan - San Remo , 19th at the Tour of Flanders , 29th at Paris – Roubaix , and 57th at Liège – Bastogne – Liège . The team also sent squads to the Trofeo <unk> , Omloop Het Nieuwsblad , Gran Premio di Lugano , Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche , Dwars door Vlaanderen , E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke , Gent @-@ Wevelgem , Scheldeprijs , Paris – Camembert , the Grand Prix de Denain , the Amstel Gold Race , <unk> @-@ Bro Léon , La Flèche Wallonne , the Eschborn @-@ Frankfurt City Loop , and the Tallinn @-@ Tartu GP , but finished no higher than 12th in any of these races . 
 = = = Fall races = = = 
 The team secured several high placings in the later season , but did not obtain any victories . In late July , the team took two of the top six placings at the <unk> , with El Fares in second and Gallopin in sixth . El Fares had been part of a breakaway , and Gallopin first from the peloton four and a half minutes back . The result put Gallopin into the lead in the French Road Cycling Cup , the year @-@ long competition among French single @-@ day races where French riders , and those on French teams , can earn points . Cusin came eighth at the Tour du Doubs in September . Petit just missed out on the podium at the Grand Prix de <unk> , finishing fourth in a large field sprint . He made the podium in a similar finish at Binche – Tournai – Binche in October , finishing third . Also in October , Dumoulin took ninth place at Paris – Bourges , from a selective sprint of ten riders . Duque was seventh in a leading group of thirteen at the Grand Prix de la Somme . Though he won only the one race , Gallopin 's consistent high finishes in the French single @-@ day races made him the overall victor of the season @-@ long French Road Cycling Cup , which he clinched after the Tour de Vendée . 
 The team sent squads to the Châteauroux Classic , the GP Ouest @-@ France , Paris – Brussels , the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec , the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal , the Grand Prix de Wallonie , the Tour de Vendée , and Paris – Tours , but finished no higher than 11th in any of these races . 
 = = Stage races = = 
 The team got their first win of the season , in their first stage race , at the Étoile de Bessèges . Dumoulin made a late selection in stage 3 , joining nine other riders who finished just ahead of the rest of the peloton , and won the sprint to the finish line . Later in February , Moncoutié won the queen stage of the Tour Méditerranéen , finishing at Mont Faron . He had previously won stages there in 2003 and 2009 , but his win this year was enough to win him the race overall thanks to his time gap . The squad also won the teams classification . Dumoulin took another win later in February , in the first stage of the two @-@ day Tour du Haut Var . He stayed latched onto Rinaldo <unk> 's wheel during the stage 's final climb , and came around him in the sprint . 
 Taaramäe took fourth overall at Paris – Nice in March , winning the youth classification with this performance , which was easily the strongest for an Estonian rider in the event 's history . Taaramäe turned in a similar strong ride at the two @-@ day , three @-@ stage Critérium International , finishing on the event 's final podium in third place , and securing the youth classification . At the concurrent Volta a Catalunya , Dumoulin took two stage wins . The first was in stage 5 , on an uphill false flat finish which Dumoulin felt suited him well . The second was more unexpected , in that it was a dead flat run in to the finish on wide roads , a more traditional field sprint . Dumoulin was delighted to win twice in front of some of the sport 's biggest stars , and stated that his next goal would be a major spring classic , perhaps the Amstel Gold Race . Dumoulin , however , was not a factor at the Amstel , finishing 104th , over eight minutes behind the winner . 
 In June , Maté won the final stage at the Route du Sud , coming best in a five @-@ man breakaway sprint . <unk> , a prolific winner in his neo @-@ pro season of 2010 but shut out in the first several months of 2011 , took his first win of the year in July at the Tour of Austria . He won a selective sprint at the end of stage 3 , finishing at the head of a 23 @-@ rider group that included the race 's top riders . It was also in that stage that Edet took the lead in the mountains classification . He went on to win it at the end of the race , holding off Skil – Shimano 's Alexandre Geniez by a single point . 
 The team took several wins in August . Dumoulin took a win in the first stage of Paris – Corrèze , breaking away near the end of the day to finish 4 seconds better than the main field . By finishing in the front group the next day , he secured overall victory in the two @-@ day event . On the same day Dumoulin secured Paris – Corrèze , Cusin narrowly defeated Saxo Bank – SunGard 's Matti Breschel at the end of stage 2 at the Tour of Denmark . After laying 28 seconds down in the overall classification before the final day at the Tour de l 'Ain , Moncoutié secured overall victory the next day . He missed out on the stage win to FDJ 's Thibaut Pinot , but by finishing only 3 seconds back he moved past previous race leader Wout Poels to win the event itself . Lastly , Gallopin took a stage at the Tour du Limousin . He took his second win of the season by breaking away from the peloton within stage 's final kilometer , and holding on for first by 6 seconds . 
 The team also sent squads to the Volta ao Algarve , Three Days of West Flanders , the Circuit de la Sarthe , the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey , Four Days of Dunkirk , the Circuit de Lorraine , the Tour of Belgium , the Critérium du Dauphiné , the Tour of Slovenia , the Eneco Tour , the Tour du Poitou Charentes , and Circuit Franco @-@ Belge , but did not obtain a stage win , classification win , or podium finish in any of them . 
 = = Grand Tours = = 
 As a Professional Continental team , Cofidis needed to be selected by the organizers of any of the Grand Tours in order to participate . They were selected to ride the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España , but not the Giro d 'Italia . 
 = = = Tour de France = = = 
 The Amaury Sport Organisation announced the wildcard entries to the Tour de France in January , much earlier in than in past years . Cofidis , who had participated in the Tour every year of their existence , were among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend . After not racing the Tour in 2010 and indicating at the time that he may not return to it , Moncoutié decided instead to ride the 2011 Tour with hopes of winning the King of the Mountains title . The decision put a bit of doubt to his potential return to the Vuelta a España , notwithstanding the team needing a wildcard for that race as well , in spite of his three @-@ year string of winning the mountains classification at that race . Taaramäe , Dumoulin , El Fares , and Vogondy were also named to the squad . 
 Taaramäe finished near the front of the race on stage 1 atop the short Mont des Alouettes hill . He was distanced by stage winner Philippe Gilbert and eventual Tour de France winner Cadel Evans , but finished with the main front group six seconds back for eighth on the day . The team had a very poor team time trial , coming in 21st . They were second to last , ahead of Euskaltel – Euskadi , who are renowned for having weak time trialists on their roster , and only by 2 seconds . The result dropped Taaramäe down to 66th place . The squad was mostly quiet in the first half of the Tour , with Gallopin taking fourth in a field sprint to finish stage 5 and Dumoulin tenth in stage 10 their best finishes . 
 On stage 13 into Lourdes , which included a passage over the hors catégorie climb Col d 'Aubisque , Moncoutié figured into a ten @-@ man breakaway . Given the lack of overall threat in the group , the peloton did not mount a serious chase , meaning the stage winner would come from this group of ten . FDJ 's Jérémy Roy broke away from the group on the way up the climb . Moncoutié strenuously chased him , with Thor Hushovd following behind . The other breakaway riders all faded , finishing five minutes back on the stage . Roy crested the Aubisque first , and Moncoutié second . Hushovd , a rider known as a very strong descender , caught up with Moncoutié on the way down the Aubisque . With a short flat section still to race after the descent , Moncoutié and Hushovd worked cohesively as a chase group behind Roy . They caught and passed Roy 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) from the end of the stage , and Hushovd eventually dropped Moncoutié as well to be the solo stage winner ; Moncoutié finished second and Roy third . Moncoutié was roundly criticized by the French press for collaborating with Hushovd in the chase , with Roy ( a fellow Frenchman ) up the road . To that point in the Tour , no French rider had yet won a stage . Team manager Boyer defended Moncoutié , saying Hushovd was likely to surpass Roy and win any sprint at the end of the stage no matter what , and by working with him Moncoutié assured himself second place rather than falling to third . 
 Taaramäe took over the white jersey for best young rider from Rigoberto Urán on stage 18 . Urán finished a distant 27th on the day , seven minutes off the pace of stage winner Andy Schleck . Taaramäe 's eighth place , three minutes back of Schleck but four minutes the better of Urán , moved him into 11th place overall and into the best young rider 's position , by 33 seconds over Pierre Rolland . Rolland won the stage at Alpe d 'Huez the next day , with Taaramäe finishing 14th two minutes back . This gave Rolland an advantage of a minute and 33 seconds going into the stage 20 individual time trial , where Taaramäe 's skills are superior . Taaramäe indeed finished better than Rolland in the time trial , tenth to Rolland 's 21st , but gained only 48 seconds . This was insufficient to win back the white jersey before the final , largely ceremonial stage into Paris on the Tour 's final day . Taaramäe finished the Tour in 12th place overall , at a deficit of eleven and a half minutes to Tour champion Cadel Evans . Moncoutié was not a major factor in any classification , finishing 41st overall and 25th in the mountains classification . Given his result at just 24 years of age , and that he retains eligibility for the white jersey in the 2012 Tour de France , Boyer expressed that he was quite pleased with Taaramäe 's performance , and that he expected the Estonian to be a contender for the overall podium at the Tour within two or three years . 
 = = = Vuelta a España = = = 
 Cofidis was one of the four wildcard entries to the Vuelta a España . After a disappointing Tour de France , Moncoutié decided to ride the Vuelta in hopes of capturing his fourth consecutive King of the Mountains jersey at the Spanish Grand Tour , which would be a new record . While he had entered 2011 thinking it would likely be his last season as a professional rider , Moncoutié changed his mind about that as well and said he would " probably be part of the bunch in 2012 . " Taaramäe was also named to the team for the Vuelta . 
 The squad did slightly better in the stage 1 team time trial than they did in the equivalent stage at the Tour de France , coming 17th of 22 teams . Moncoutié secured a high placing on stage 6 , coming in ninth on the day with the lead chase group that finished behind four Liquigas – Cannondale riders at the head of the race . Taaramäe climbed with the race 's best riders on stage 9 , coming in seventh on La <unk> . However , he was not any sort of overall threat – he was already over an hour down in the overall standings , having been in breakaways in stages 4 , 6 , and 8 which did not succeed and lost considerable time to the stage winner each day . 
 Moncoutié participated in a winning breakaway in stage 11 . Some 19 km ( 12 mi ) from the end of the stage , which concluded on a climb at Estación de Montaña <unk> , Moncoutié set out on a solo attack to win the stage . The attack was successful , and the veteran Frenchman won a Vuelta stage for the fourth consecutive year . He said after the stage that he rued falling short at Sierra Nevada , and had studied this course profile carefully to know when to attack to get away for victory . The result also moved Moncoutié up to second in the mountains classification , just a single point behind Ag2r – La Mondiale 's Matteo Montaguti . He took the jersey two days later on stage 13 by joining another winning breakaway . Montaguti had also made the breakaway , but he was unable to stay at the front of the race all day . Moncoutié took two second places and one win on the final three climbs of the day , resulting in a 12 @-@ point lead over Montaguti in the classification . The next day was another good one for the team . Taaramäe made the morning breakaway and held off the race 's top riders as they neared the front of the race . He held on for victory atop La Farrapona by 25 seconds ahead of eventual Vuelta champion Juan José Cobo in second , as all other members of the breakaway finished well back . 
 Moncoutié all but clinched his mountains classification triumph on stage 15 . While he finished nine minutes behind Cobo on Angliru , he won the day 's second climb to score ten mountain points and increase his lead over Montaguti to 22 points . He scored his final mountain classification points on stage 17 , ending with a total of 63 . Montaguti nearly reclaimed the jersey on stage 18 , when he made a breakaway and Moncoutié did not . Fortunately for Moncoutié , teammate Sijmens had made the escape group and kept Montaguti from maximum points on four of the five climbs . Given that riders who are not involved in a classification nor have teammates that are will generally not ride against someone who is , Sijmens ' presence in this breakway was effectively the only way Moncoutié could have retained the jersey . Moncoutié continued to lead Montaguti , by a score of 63 @-@ 56 . Neither rider scored again , and Moncoutié won his fourth consecutive mountains title , a first in Vuelta history . He was the team 's best overall finisher as well , but was not any real threat , coming in 37th overall at a deficit of over an hour to Cobo . Taaramäe , for his part , did not complete the Vuelta , abandoning on stage 17 .

 = James VI and I = 
 James VI and I ( 19 June 1566 – 27 March 1625 ) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death . The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciary , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union . 
 James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great @-@ great @-@ grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland ( through both his parents ) , uniquely positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known as the Jacobean era after him , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself " King of Great Britain and Ireland " . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonisation of the Americas began . 
 At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . Under James , the " Golden Age " of Elizabethan literature and drama continued , with writers such as William Shakespeare , John Donne , Ben Jonson , and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie ( 1597 ) , The True Law of Free Monarchies ( 1598 ) , and Basilikon Doron ( 1599 ) . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that was named after him : the Authorised King James Version . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed " the wisest fool in Christendom " , an epithet associated with his character ever since . Since the latter half of the 20th century , historians have tended to revise James 's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch . 
 = = Childhood = = 
 = = = Birth = = = 
 James was the only son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and her second husband , Henry Stuart , Lord Darnley . Both Mary and Darnley were great @-@ grandchildren of Henry VII of England through Margaret Tudor , the older sister of Henry VIII . Mary 's rule over Scotland was insecure , and she and her husband , being Roman Catholics , faced a rebellion by Protestant noblemen . During Mary 's and Darnley 's difficult marriage , Darnley secretly allied himself with the rebels and conspired in the murder of the Queen 's private secretary , David Rizzio , just three months before James 's birth . 
 James was born on 19 June 1566 at Edinburgh Castle , and as the eldest son and heir apparent of the monarch automatically became Duke of Rothesay and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland . He was baptised " Charles James " or " James Charles " on 17 December 1566 in a Catholic ceremony held at Stirling Castle . His godparents were Charles IX of France ( represented by John , Count of Brienne ) , Elizabeth I of England ( represented by the Earl of Bedford ) , and Emmanuel Philibert , Duke of Savoy ( represented by ambassador Philibert du Croc ) . Mary refused to let the Archbishop of St Andrews , whom she referred to as " a <unk> priest " , spit in the child 's mouth , as was then the custom . The subsequent entertainment , devised by Frenchman Bastian Pagez , featured men dressed as satyrs and sporting tails ; the English guests took offence , thinking the satyrs " done against them " . 
 James 's father , Darnley , was murdered on 10 February 1567 at Kirk o ' Field , Edinburgh , perhaps in revenge for Rizzio 's death . James inherited his father 's titles of Duke of Albany and Earl of Ross . Mary was already unpopular , and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to James Hepburn , 4th Earl of Bothwell , who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley , heightened widespread bad feeling towards her . In June 1567 , Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in Loch Leven Castle ; she never saw her son again . She was forced to abdicate on 24 July 1567 in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half @-@ brother , James Stewart , Earl of Moray , as regent . 
 = = = Regencies = = = 
 The care of James was entrusted to the Earl and Countess of Mar , " to be conserved , nursed , and <unk> " in the security of Stirling Castle . James was crowned King of Scots at the age of thirteen months at the Church of the Holy Rude , Stirling , by Adam Bothwell , Bishop of Orkney , on 29 July 1567 . The sermon at the coronation was preached by John Knox . In accordance with the religious beliefs of most of the Scottish ruling class , James was brought up as a member of the Protestant Church of Scotland . The Privy Council selected George Buchanan , Peter Young , Adam Erskine ( lay abbot of Cambuskenneth ) , and David Erskine ( lay abbot of Dryburgh ) as James 's preceptors or tutors . As the young king 's senior tutor , Buchanan subjected James to regular beatings but also instilled in him a lifelong passion for literature and learning . Buchanan sought to turn James into a God @-@ fearing , Protestant king who accepted the limitations of monarchy , as outlined in his treatise De Jure Regni apud Scotos . 
 In 1568 , Mary escaped from her imprisonment at Loch Leven Castle , leading to several years of sporadic violence . The Earl of Moray defeated Mary 's troops at the Battle of Langside , forcing her to flee to England , where she was subsequently imprisoned by Elizabeth . On 23 January 1570 , Moray was assassinated by James Hamilton of <unk> . The next regent was James 's paternal grandfather Matthew Stewart , 4th Earl of Lennox , who was carried fatally wounded into Stirling Castle a year later after a raid by Mary 's supporters . His successor , the Earl of Mar , " took a vehement sickness " and died on 28 October 1572 at Stirling . Mar 's illness , wrote James Melville , followed a banquet at Dalkeith Palace given by James Douglas , 4th Earl of Morton . 
 Morton was elected to Mar 's office and proved in many ways the most effective of James 's regents , but he made enemies by his rapacity . He fell from favour when Frenchman Esmé Stewart , Sieur d 'Aubigny , first cousin of James 's father Lord Darnley and future Earl of Lennox , arrived in Scotland and quickly established himself as the first of James 's powerful male favourites . Morton was executed on 2 June 1581 , belatedly charged with complicity in Lord Darnley 's murder . On 8 August , James made Lennox the only duke in Scotland . The king , then fifteen years old , remained under the influence of Lennox for about one more year . 
 = = Rule in Scotland = = 
 Lennox was a Protestant convert , but he was distrusted by Scottish Calvinists who noticed the physical displays of affection between him and the king and alleged that Lennox " went about to draw the King to carnal lust " . In August 1582 , in what became known as the Ruthven Raid , the Protestant earls of Gowrie and Angus lured James into Ruthven Castle , imprisoned him , and forced Lennox to leave Scotland . During his imprisonment , John Craig , whom James had personally appointed Royal Chaplain in 1579 , rebuked him so sharply from the pulpit ( 19 September 1582 ) for having issued a proclamation offensive to the clergy " that the king wept " . 
 After James was liberated in June 1583 , he assumed increasing control of his kingdom . He pushed through the Black Acts to assert royal authority over the Kirk , and denounced the writings of his former tutor Buchanan . Between 1584 and 1603 , he established effective royal government and relative peace among the lords , ably assisted by John Maitland of Thirlestane who led the government until 1592 . An eight @-@ man commission known as the <unk> brought some control over the ruinous state of James 's finances in 1596 , but it drew opposition from vested interests . It was disbanded within a year after a riot in Edinburgh that was stoked by anti @-@ Catholicism led the court to withdraw to Linlithgow temporarily . 
 One last Scottish attempt against the king 's person occurred in August 1600 , when James was apparently assaulted by Alexander Ruthven , the Earl of Gowrie 's younger brother , at Gowrie House , the seat of the Ruthvens . Ruthven was run through by James 's page John Ramsay and the Earl of Gowrie was himself killed in the ensuing fracas ; there were few surviving witnesses . James 's account of the circumstances was not universally believed , given his history with the Ruthvens and the fact that he owed them a great deal of money . 
 In 1586 , James signed the Treaty of Berwick with England . That and the execution of his mother in 1587 , which he denounced as a " preposterous and strange procedure " , helped clear the way for his succession south of the border . Queen Elizabeth was unmarried and childless , and James was her most likely successor . Securing the English succession became a cornerstone of his policy . During the Spanish Armada crisis of 1588 , he assured Elizabeth of his support as " your natural son and compatriot of your country " . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 Throughout his youth , James was praised for his chastity , since he showed little interest in women . After the loss of Lennox , he continued to prefer male company . A suitable marriage , however , was necessary to reinforce his monarchy , and the choice fell on fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Anne of Denmark , younger daughter of Protestant Frederick II . Shortly after a proxy marriage in Copenhagen in August 1589 , Anne sailed for Scotland but was forced by storms to the coast of Norway . James sailed from Leith on hearing that the crossing had been abandoned , in what Willson calls " the one romantic episode of his life " , with a 300 @-@ strong retinue to fetch Anne personally . The couple were married formally at the Bishop 's Palace in Oslo on 23 November and returned to Scotland on 1 May 1590 , after stays at Elsinore and Copenhagen and a meeting with Tycho Brahe . By all accounts , James was at first infatuated with Anne and , in the early years of their marriage , seems always to have showed her patience and affection . The royal couple produced three children who survived to adulthood : Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales , who died of typhoid fever in 1612 , aged 18 ; Elizabeth , later queen of Bohemia ; and Charles , his successor . Anne died before her husband in March 1619 . 
 = = = Witch hunts = = = 
 James 's visit to Denmark , a country familiar with witch @-@ hunts , sparked an interest in the study of witchcraft , which he considered a branch of theology . He attended the North Berwick witch trials , the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the Witchcraft Act 1563 . Several people were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James 's ship , most notably Agnes Sampson . 
 James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches and wrote the Daemonologie in 1597 , a tract inspired by his personal involvement which opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare 's Tragedy of Macbeth . James personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches . After 1599 , his views became more sceptical . In a later letter written in England to his son Prince Henry , James congratulates the Prince on " the discovery of yon little counterfeit wench . I pray God ye may be my heir in such discoveries ... most miracles now @-@ a @-@ days prove but illusions , and ye may see by this how wary judges should be in trusting accusations " . 
 = = = Highlands and Islands = = = 
 The forcible dissolution of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV in 1493 had led to troubled times for the western seaboard . The king had subdued the organised military might of the Hebrides , but he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance . As a result , the 16th century became known as <unk> nan <unk> , the time of raids . Furthermore , the effects of the Reformation were slow to affect the Gàidhealtachd , driving a religious wedge between this area and centres of political control in the Central Belt . 
 In 1540 , James V had toured the Hebrides , forcing the clan chiefs to accompany him . There followed a period of peace , but the clans were soon at loggerheads with one another again . During James VI 's reign , the citizens of the Hebrides were portrayed as lawless barbarians rather than being the cradle of Scottish Christianity and nationhood . Official documents describe the peoples of the Highlands as " void of the <unk> and <unk> of God " who were prone to " all <unk> of barbarous and <unk> <unk> " . The Gaelic language , spoken fluently by James IV and probably by James V , became known in the time of James VI as " <unk> " or Irish , implying that it was foreign in nature . The Scottish Parliament decided that Gaelic had become a principal cause of the Highlanders ' shortcomings and sought to abolish it . 
 It was against this background that James VI authorised the " Gentleman Adventurers of Fife " to civilise the " most barbarous Isle of Lewis " in 1598 . James wrote that the colonists were to act " not by agreement " with the local inhabitants , but " by extirpation of <unk> " . Their landing at Stornoway began well , but the colonists were driven out by local forces commanded by Murdoch and Neil MacLeod . The colonists tried again in 1605 with the same result , although a third attempt in 1607 was more successful . The Statutes of Iona were enacted in 1609 , which required clan chiefs to : send their heirs to Lowland Scotland to be educated in English @-@ speaking Protestant schools ; provide support for Protestant ministers to Highland parishes ; outlaw bards ; and regularly report to Edinburgh to answer for their actions . So began a process " specifically aimed at the extirpation of the Gaelic language , the destruction of its traditional culture and the suppression of its bearers . " 
 In the Northern Isles , James 's cousin Patrick Stewart , Earl of Orkney resisted the Statutes of Iona and was consequently imprisoned . His natural son Robert led an unsuccessful rebellion against James , and the Earl and his son were hanged . Their estates were forfeited , and the Orkney and Shetland islands were annexed to the Crown . 
 = = = Theory of monarchy = = = 
 In 1597 – 98 , James wrote The True Law of Free Monarchies and Basilikon Doron ( Royal Gift ) , in which he argues a theological basis for monarchy . In the True Law , he sets out the divine right of kings , explaining that kings are higher beings than other men for Biblical reasons , though " the highest bench is the <unk> to sit upon " . The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy , by which a king may impose new laws by royal prerogative but must also pay heed to tradition and to God , who would " <unk> up such scourges as pleaseth him , for punishment of wicked kings " . 
 Basilikon Doron was written as a book of instruction for four year old Prince Henry and provides a more practical guide to kingship . The work is considered to be well written and perhaps the best example of James 's prose . James 's advice concerning parliaments , which he understood as merely the king 's " head court " , foreshadows his difficulties with the English Commons : " Hold no Parliaments , " he tells Henry , " but for the <unk> of new Lawes , which would be but <unk> " . In the True Law , James maintains that the king owns his realm as a feudal lord owns his fief , because kings arose " before any estates or ranks of men , before any parliaments were holden , or laws made , and by them was the land distributed , which at first was wholly theirs . And so it follows of necessity that kings were the authors and makers of the laws , and not the laws of the kings . " 
 = = = Literary patronage = = = 
 James was concerned in the 1580s and 1590s to promote the literature of the country of his birth . His treatise Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody was published in 1584 at the age of 18 . It was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue of Scots , applying Renaissance principles . He also made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music , seeing the two in connection . 
 In furtherance of these aims , he was both patron and head of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians known as the Castalian Band , which included William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie among others , Montgomerie being a favourite of the King . James was himself a poet , and was happy to be seen as a practising member in the group . 
 By the late 1590s , his championing of his native Scottish tradition was diffused to some extent by the increasingly expected prospect of inheritance of the English throne . William Alexander and other courtier poets started to anglicise their written language , and followed the king to London after 1603 . James 's characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the Scottish court made him a defining figure in many respects for English Renaissance poetry and drama , which reached a pinnacle of achievement in his reign , but his patronage of the high style in the Scottish tradition , which included his ancestor James I of Scotland , largely became sidelined . 
 = = Accession in England = = 
 Elizabeth I was the last of Henry VIII 's descendants , and James was seen as the most likely heir to the English throne through his great @-@ grandmother Margaret Tudor , who was Henry VIII 's oldest sister . From 1601 , in the last years of Elizabeth I 's life , certain English politicians — notably her chief minister Sir Robert Cecil — maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare in advance for a smooth succession . Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne in March 1603 , with the Queen clearly dying . Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March , and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day . 
 On 5 April , James left Edinburgh for London , promising to return every three years ( a promise that he did not keep ) , and progressed slowly southwards . Local lords received him with lavish hospitality along the route and James was amazed by the wealth of his new land and subjects . James said that he was ' swapping a stony couch for a deep feather bed ' . At Cecil 's house , Theobalds , Hertfordshire , James was so in awe that he bought it there and then , arriving in the capital after Elizabeth 's funeral . His new subjects flocked to see him , relieved that the succession had triggered neither unrest nor invasion . When he entered London on 7 May , he was mobbed by a crowd of spectators . 
 His English coronation took place on 25 July , with elaborate allegories provided by dramatic poets such as Thomas Dekker and Ben Jonson . An outbreak of plague restricted festivities , but " the streets seemed paved with men , " wrote Dekker . " Stalls instead of rich wares were set out with children , open casements filled up with women . " 
 The kingdom to which James succeeded was , however , not without its problems . Monopolies and taxation had engendered a widespread sense of grievance , and the costs of war in Ireland had become a heavy burden on the government . By the time of his succession , England had incurred a debt of £ 400 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Early reign in England = = 
 James survived two conspiracies in the first year of his reign , despite the smoothness of the succession and the warmth of his welcome : the Bye Plot and Main Plot , which led to the arrest of Lord Cobham and Sir Walter Raleigh , among others . Those hoping for governmental change from James were at first disappointed when he maintained Elizabeth 's Privy Councillors in office , as secretly planned with Cecil , but James shortly added long @-@ time supporter Henry Howard and his nephew Thomas Howard to the Privy Council , as well as five Scottish nobles . 
 In the early years of James 's reign , the day @-@ to @-@ day running of the government was tightly managed by the shrewd Robert Cecil , later Earl of Salisbury , ably assisted by the experienced Thomas Egerton , whom James made Baron Ellesmere and Lord Chancellor , and by Thomas Sackville , soon Earl of Dorset , who continued as Lord Treasurer . As a consequence , James was free to concentrate on bigger issues , such as a scheme for a closer union between England and Scotland and matters of foreign policy , as well as to enjoy his leisure pursuits , particularly hunting . 
 James was ambitious to build on the personal union of the Crowns of Scotland and England to establish a single country under one monarch , one parliament , and one law , a plan which met opposition in both realms . " Hath He not made us all in one island , " James told the English parliament , " compassed with one sea and of itself by nature indivisible ? " In April 1604 , however , the Commons refused his request to be titled " King of Great Britain " on legal grounds . In October 1604 , he assumed the title " King of Great Britain " by proclamation rather than statute , though Sir Francis Bacon told him that he could not use the style in " any legal proceeding , instrument or assurance " . 
 James achieved more success in foreign policy . Never having been at war with Spain , he devoted his efforts to bringing the long Anglo – Spanish War to an end , and a peace treaty was signed between the two countries in August 1604 , thanks to skilled diplomacy on the part of Robert Cecil and Henry Howard , now Earl of Northampton , which James celebrated by hosting a great banquet . Freedom of worship for Catholics in England , however , continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy , causing constant dilemmas for James , distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance towards them . 
 = = = Gunpowder Plot = = = 
 A dissident Catholic , Guy Fawkes , was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings on the night of 4 – 5 November 1605 , the eve of the state opening of the second session of James 's first English Parliament . He was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which Fawkes intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction , as James put it , " not only ... of my person , nor of my wife and posterity also , but of the whole body of the State in general " . The sensational discovery of the Gunpowder Plot , as it quickly became known , aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons . Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth . Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed . 
 = = King and Parliament = = 
 The co @-@ operation between monarch and Parliament following the Gunpowder Plot was atypical . Instead , it was the previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides for the rest of the reign , though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity . On 7 July 1604 , James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies . " I will not thank where I feel no thanks due " , he had remarked in his closing speech . " ... I am not of such a stock as to praise fools ... You see how many things you did not well ... I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come " . 
 As James 's reign progressed , his government faced growing financial pressures , due partly to creeping inflation but also to the profligacy and financial incompetence of James 's court . In February 1610 , Salisbury proposed a scheme , known as the Great Contract , whereby Parliament , in return for ten royal concessions , would grant a lump sum of £ 600 @,@ 000 to pay off the king 's debts plus an annual grant of £ 200 @,@ 000 . The ensuing prickly negotiations became so protracted that James eventually lost patience and dismissed Parliament on 31 December 1610 . " Your greatest error " , he told Salisbury , " hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall " . The same pattern was repeated with the so @-@ called " <unk> Parliament " of 1614 , which James dissolved after a mere nine weeks when the Commons hesitated to grant him the money he required . James then ruled without parliament until 1621 , employing officials such as the merchant Lionel Cranfield , who were astute at raising and saving money for the crown , and sold baronetcies and other dignities , many created for the purpose , as an alternative source of income . 
 = = = Spanish Match = = = 
 Another potential source of income was the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles , Prince of Wales , and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain . The policy of the Spanish Match , as it was called , was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war . Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match — which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade . 
 The policy was supported by the Howards and other Catholic @-@ leaning ministers and diplomats — together known as the Spanish Party — but deeply distrusted in Protestant England . When Sir Walter Raleigh was released from imprisonment in 1616 , he embarked on a hunt for gold in South America with strict instructions from James not to engage the Spanish . Raleigh 's expedition was a disastrous failure , and his son Walter was killed fighting the Spanish . On Raleigh 's return to England , James had him executed to the indignation of the public , who opposed the appeasement of Spain . James 's policy was further jeopardised by the outbreak of the Thirty Years ' War , especially after his Protestant son @-@ in @-@ law , Frederick V , Elector Palatine , was ousted from Bohemia by the Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620 , and Spanish troops simultaneously invaded Frederick 's Rhineland home territory . Matters came to a head when James finally called a Parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition in support of his son @-@ in @-@ law . The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick , and on the other — remembering the profits gained under Elizabeth by naval attacks on Spanish gold shipments — called for a war directly against Spain . In November 1621 , roused by Sir Edward Coke , they framed a petition asking not only for war with Spain but also for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant , and for enforcement of the anti @-@ Catholic laws . James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment , which provoked them into issuing a statement protesting their rights , including freedom of speech . Urged on by the Duke of Buckingham and the Spanish ambassador Gondomar , James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament . 
 In early 1623 , Prince Charles , now 22 , and Buckingham decided to seize the initiative and travel to Spain incognito , to win the Infanta directly , but the mission proved an ineffectual mistake . The Infanta detested Charles , and the Spanish confronted them with terms that included the repeal of anti @-@ Catholic legislation by Parliament . Though a treaty was signed , the prince and duke returned to England in October without the Infanta and immediately renounced the treaty , much to the delight of the British people . Disillusioned by the visit to Spain , Charles and Buckingham now turned James 's Spanish policy upon its head and called for a French match and a war against the Habsburg empire . To raise the necessary finance , they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament , which met in February 1624 . For once , the outpouring of anti @-@ Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court , where control of policy was shifting from James to Charles and Buckingham , who pressured the king to declare war and engineered the impeachment of Lord Treasurer Lionel Cranfield , by now made Earl of Middlesex , when he opposed the plan on grounds of cost . The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous : James still refused to declare or fund a war , but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to finance a war against Spain , a stance which was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign . 
 = = King and Church = = 
 After the Gunpowder Plot , James sanctioned harsh measures to control non @-@ conforming English Catholics . In May 1606 , Parliament passed the Popish Recusants Act which could require any citizen to take an Oath of Allegiance denying the Pope 's authority over the king . James was conciliatory towards Catholics who took the Oath of Allegiance , and tolerated crypto @-@ Catholicism even at court . Henry Howard , for example , was a crypto @-@ Catholic , received back into the Catholic Church in his final months . On ascending the English throne , James suspected that he might need the support of Catholics in England , so he assured the Earl of Northumberland , a prominent sympathiser of the old religion , that he would not persecute " any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law " . 
 In the <unk> Petition of 1603 , the Puritan clergy demanded the abolition of confirmation , wedding rings , and the term " priest " , among other things , and that the wearing of cap and surplice become optional . James was strict in enforcing conformity at first , inducing a sense of persecution amongst many Puritans ; but ejections and suspensions from livings became rarer as the reign continued . As a result of the Hampton Court Conference of 1604 , a new translation and compilation of approved books of the Bible was commissioned to resolve discrepancies among different translations then being used . The Authorized King James Version , as it came to be known , was completed in 1611 and is considered a masterpiece of Jacobean prose . It is still in widespread use . 
 In Scotland , James attempted to bring the Scottish kirk " so neir as can be " to the English church and to reestablish episcopacy , a policy that met with strong opposition from presbyterians . James returned to Scotland in 1617 for the only time after his accession in England , in the hope of implementing Anglican ritual . James 's bishops forced his Five Articles of Perth through a General Assembly the following year , but the rulings were widely resisted . James left the church in Scotland divided at his death , a source of future problems for his son . 
 = = Favourites = = 
 James 's sexuality is a matter of dispute . Throughout his life James had close relationships with male courtiers , which has caused debate among historians about their exact nature . After his accession in England , his peaceful and scholarly attitude contrasted strikingly with the bellicose and flirtatious behaviour of Elizabeth , as indicated by the contemporary epigram Rex fuit Elizabeth , nunc est regina Jacobus ( Elizabeth was King , now James is Queen ) . 
 Many of James 's biographers conclude that Esmé Stewart ( later Duke of Lennox ) , Robert Carr ( later Earl of Somerset ) , and George Villiers ( later Duke of Buckingham ) were his lovers . Restoration of <unk> Hall undertaken in 2004 – 08 revealed a previously unknown passage linking the bedchambers of James and Villiers . 
 A few biographers of James argue that the relationships were not sexual . James 's Basilikon Doron lists sodomy among crimes " ye are bound in conscience never to forgive " , and James 's wife Anne gave birth to seven live children , as well as suffering two stillbirths and at least three other miscarriages . Contemporary Huguenot poet Théophile de Viau observed that " it is well known that the king of England / fucks the Duke of Buckingham " . Buckingham himself provides evidence that he slept in the same bed as the King , writing to James many years later that he had pondered " whether you loved me now ... better than at the time which I shall never forget at Farnham , where the bed 's head could not be found between the master and his dog " . Buckingham 's words may be interpreted as non @-@ sexual , in the context of seventeenth @-@ century court life , and remain ambiguous . 
 When the Earl of Salisbury died in 1612 , he was little mourned by those who jostled to fill the power vacuum . Until Salisbury 's death , the Elizabethan administrative system over which he had presided continued to function with relative efficiency ; from this time forward , however , James 's government entered a period of decline and disrepute . Salisbury 's passing gave James the notion of governing in person as his own chief Minister of State , with his young Scottish favourite Robert Carr carrying out many of Salisbury 's former duties , but James 's inability to attend closely to official business exposed the government to factionalism . 
 The Howard party , consisting of Northampton , Suffolk , Suffolk 's son @-@ in @-@ law Lord Knollys , and Charles Howard , Earl of Nottingham , along with Sir Thomas Lake , soon took control of much of the government and its patronage . Even the powerful Carr fell into the Howard camp , hardly experienced for the responsibilities thrust upon him and often dependent on his intimate friend Sir Thomas Overbury for assistance with government papers . Carr had an adulterous affair with Frances Howard , Countess of Essex , daughter of the Earl of Suffolk , whom James assisted in securing an annulment of her marriage to free her to marry Carr . 
 In summer 1615 , however , it emerged that Overbury had been poisoned . He had died on 15 September 1613 in the Tower of London , where he had been placed at the King 's request . Among those convicted of the murder were Frances and Robert Carr , the latter having been replaced as the king 's favourite in the meantime by Villiers . James pardoned Frances and commuted Carr 's sentence of death , eventually pardoning him in 1624 . The implication of the King in such a scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished James 's court with an image of corruption and depravity . The subsequent downfall of the Howards left Villiers unchallenged as the supreme figure in the government by 1619 . 
 = = Final year = = 
 After about the age of fifty , James suffered increasingly from arthritis , gout , and kidney stones . He also lost his teeth and drank heavily . The king was often seriously ill during the last year of his life , leaving him an increasingly peripheral figure , rarely able to visit London , while Buckingham consolidated his control of Charles to ensure his own future . One theory is that James may have suffered from porphyria , a disease of which his descendant George III of the United Kingdom exhibited some symptoms . James described his urine to physician Théodore de Mayerne as being the " dark red colour of Alicante wine " . The theory is dismissed by some experts , particularly in James 's case , because he had kidney stones which can lead to blood in the urine , colouring it red . 
 In early 1625 , James was plagued by severe attacks of arthritis , gout , and fainting fits , and fell seriously ill in March with tertian ague and then suffered a stroke . James finally died at Theobalds House on 27 March during a violent attack of dysentery , with Buckingham at his bedside . James 's funeral on 7 May was a magnificent but disorderly affair . Bishop John Williams of Lincoln preached the sermon , observing , " King Solomon died in Peace , when he had lived about sixty years ... and so you know did King James " . 
 James was buried in Westminster Abbey . The position of the tomb was lost for many years . The lead coffin was found in the Henry VII vault in the 19th century , during an excavation of many of the vaults beneath the floor . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 James was widely mourned . For all his flaws , he had largely retained the affection of his people , who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era . " As he lived in peace , " remarked the Earl of Kellie , " so did he die in peace , and I pray God our king [ Charles I ] may follow him " . The earl prayed in vain : once in power , Charles and Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure . James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes , such as the hunt ; and his later dependence on male favourites at a scandal @-@ ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth . 
 According to a tradition originating with anti @-@ Stuart historians of the mid @-@ seventeenth @-@ century , James 's taste for political absolutism , his financial irresponsibility , and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established the foundations of the English Civil War . James bequeathed Charles a fatal belief in the divine right of kings , combined with a disdain for Parliament , which culminated in the execution of Charles and the abolition of the monarchy . Over the last three hundred years , the king 's reputation has suffered from the acid description of him by Sir Anthony Weldon , whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s . 
 Other influential anti @-@ James histories written during the 1650s include : Sir Edward Peyton , Divine Catastrophe of the Kingly Family of the House of Stuarts ( 1652 ) ; Arthur Wilson , History of Great Britain , Being the Life and Reign of King James I ( 1658 ) ; and Francis Osborne , Historical Memoirs of the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James ( 1658 ) . David Harris Willson 's 1956 biography continued much of this hostility . In the words of historian Jenny Wormald , Willson 's book was an " astonishing spectacle of a work whose every page proclaimed its author 's increasing hatred for his subject " . Since Willson , however , the stability of James 's government in Scotland and in the early part of his English reign , as well as his relatively enlightened views on religion and war , have earned him a re @-@ evaluation from many historians , who have rescued his reputation from this tradition of criticism . 
 Under James the Plantation of Ulster by English and Scots Protestants began , and the English colonisation of North America started its course with the foundation of Jamestown , Virginia , in 1607 . Cuper 's Cove , Newfoundland , was founded in 1610 . During the next 150 years , England would fight with Spain , the Netherlands , and France for control of the continent , while religious division in Ireland between Protestant and Catholic has lasted for 400 years . By actively pursuing more than just a personal union of his realms , he helped lay the foundations for a unitary British state .

On 20 October 1604 , James issued a proclamation at Westminster changing his style to " King of Great Britain , France , and Ireland , Defender of the Faith , etc . " The style was not used on English statutes , but was used on proclamations , coinage , letters , treaties , and in Scotland .

The arms were supported by two unicorns Argent armed , crined and unguled Proper , gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses <unk> and fleurs de lys a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or . The crest was a lion <unk> <unk> Gules , imperially crowned Or , holding in the dexter paw a sword and in the sinister paw a sceptre both erect and Proper . 
 The Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland under James was symbolised heraldically by combining their arms , supporters and badges . Contention as to how the arms should be marshalled , and to which kingdom should take precedence , was solved by having different arms for each country . 
 The arms used in England were : Quarterly , I and IV , quarterly 1st and 4th Azure three fleurs de lys Or ( for France ) , 2nd and 3rd Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or ( for England ) ; II Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory @-@ counter @-@ flory Gules ( for Scotland ) ; III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent ( for Ireland , this was the first time that Ireland was included in the royal arms ) . The supporters became : dexter a lion rampant guardant Or imperially crowned and sinister the Scottish unicorn . The unicorn replaced the red dragon of Cadwaladr , which was introduced by the Tudors . The unicorn has remained in the royal arms of the two united realms . The English crest and motto was retained . The compartment often contained a branch of the Tudor rose , with shamrock and thistle engrafted on the same stem . The arms were frequently shown with James 's personal motto , Beati <unk> . 
 The arms used in Scotland were : Quarterly , I and IV Scotland , II England and France , III Ireland , with Scotland taking precedence over England . The supporters were : dexter a unicorn of Scotland imperially crowned , supporting a tilting lance flying a banner Azure a saltire Argent ( Cross of Saint Andrew ) and sinister the crowned lion of England supporting a similar lance flying a banner Argent a cross Gules ( Cross of Saint George ) . The Scottish crest and motto was retained , following the Scottish practice the motto In <unk> ( which is short for In My Defens God Me Defend ) was placed above the crest . 
 As royal badges James used : the Tudor rose , the thistle ( for Scotland ; first used by James III of Scotland ) , the Tudor rose <unk> with the thistle ensigned with the royal crown , a harp ( for Ireland ) and a fleur de lys ( for France ) .

 = Jahanpanah = 
 Jahanpanah ( Persian : <unk> ‌ <unk> ) was the fourth medieval city of Delhi established in 1326 – 1327 by Muhammad bin Tughlaq ( 1321 – 51 ) , of the Delhi Sultanate . To address the constant threat of the Mongols , Tughlaq built the fortified city of Jahanpanah ( meaning in Persian : “ Refuge of the World ” ) subsuming the Adilabad fort that had been built in the 14th century and also all the establishments lying between Qila Rai Pithora and Siri Fort . Neither the city nor the fort has survived . Many reasons have been offered for such a situation . One of which is stated as the idiosyncratic rule of Mohammed bin Tughlaq when inexplicably he shifted the capital to Daulatabad in the Deccan and came back to Delhi soon after . 
 The ruins of the city ’ s walls are even now discerned in the road between Siri to Qutub Minar and also in isolated patches behind the Indian Institute of Technology ( IIT ) , in Begumpur , Khirki Masjid near Khirki village , Satpula and many other nearby locations ; at some sections , as seen at Satpula , the fort walls were large enough to have few in built store rooms to stack provisions and armory . The mystery of the city ’ s precincts ( complex ) has unfolded over the years with later day excavations revealing a large number of monuments in the villages and colonies of South Delhi . Due to compulsions of urban expansion of the Capital City of Delhi , Jahanpanah is now part of the upscale urban development of South Delhi . The village and the wealth of ruins scattered all around are now enclosed by South Delhi suburbs of <unk> Park South , Malviya Nagar , <unk> , the Aurobindo Ashram , Delhi branch and other smaller housing colony developments . It is hemmed in the North – South direction between the Outer Ring Road and the Qutb Complex and on the east – west direction by the Mehrauli road and the Chirag Delhi road , with Indian Institute of Technology located on the other side of the Mehrauli road as an important landmark .

 Jahanpanah ’ s etymology consists of two Persian words , <unk> ‘ Jahan ’ , “ the world ” , and <unk> ‘ <unk> ’ , “ shelter ” , thus “ Refuge of the World ” 
 = = History = = 
 Mohammed bin Tughlaq , son of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq who built Tughlaqabad , constructed his new city of Jahanpanah between 1326 and 1327 by encircling the earlier cities of Siri and Lal Kot with 13 gates . But what remains of the city and Adilabad fort are large ruins , which leave much ambiguity and conjectures regarding its physical status as to why and when it was built by Tughlaq . Some of the structures which have survived partially are the Bijay Mandal ( that is inferred to have housed the Hazar Sutan Palace , now destroyed ) , Begumpur Mosque , Serai Shaji Mahal , Lal Gumbad , Baradari with other nearby structures and scattered swathes of rubble masonry walls . From Ibn Batuta ’ s chronicle of the period ( he lived in Delhi from 1333 – 41 ) it is inferred that Lal Kot ( Qutb complex ) was then the urban area , Siri was the military cantonment and the remaining area consisted of his palace ( Bijaymandal ) and other structures like mosques , etc . 
 Ibn Batuta has reasoned that Muhammad Shah wished to see a unified city comprising Old Delhi , Siri , Jahanpanah and Tughlaqabad with one contiguous fortification encompassing them but cost considerations forced him to abandon the plan halfway . In his chronicle , Batuta also stated that the Hazar Sutan Palace ( 1000 pillared palace ) , built outside the Siri fort limits but within the Jahanpanah city area , was the residence of the Tughlaq . 
 Hazar Sutan Palace was located within the fortified area of the <unk> in <unk> Mandal ( literal meaning in Hindi : ' victory platform ' ) . The grand palace with its audience hall of beautifully painted wooden canopy and columns is vividly described but it does no longer exists . The Fort acted as a safe haven for the people living between Qila Rai Pithora and Siri . <unk> continued to act as Tughlaq ’ s centre of government until , for strange and inexplicable reasons , he shifted his capital to Daulatabad , however he returned after a short period . 
 = = = Adilabad = = = 
 Adilabad , a fort of modest size , built on the hills to the south of Tughlaqabad was provided with protective massive ramparts on its boundary around the city of Jahanpanah . The fort was much smaller than its predecessor fort , Tughlaqabad fort , but of similar design . Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) in its evaluation of the status of the fort for conservation has recorded that two gates , 
 one with barbicans between two bastions on the south @-@ east and another on the south @-@ west . Inside , it , separated by a bailey , is a citadel consisting of walls , bastions and gates within which lay the palaces . 
 The fort was also known as ‘ <unk> ’ , but inferred as a later day development . The two gates on the southeast and southwest of Adilabad fort had chambers at the lower level while the east and west gates had grain bins and courtyards at the upper floors . The fortifications built , linking with the other two city walls , was 12 m ( 39 @.@ 4 ft ) in thickness and extended to a length of 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) . Another smaller fortress , called the Nai @-@ ka @-@ kot was also built at a distance of about 700 m ( 2 @,@ 296 @.@ 6 ft ) from Adilabad , with citadel and army camps , which are now seen only in ruins . 
 Tughlaq ’ s primary attention to infrastructure , particularly of water supply to the city , was also well thought out . A structure ( weir or tank ) with seven sluices ( Urdu : Satpula ) was built on a stream that flowed through the city . This structure called the Satpula is still existing ( though non – functional ) near Khirki village on the boundary walls of Jahanpanah . Similar structures had also been built at Tughlaqabad and Delhi in Hauz Khas Complex , thus covering the water supply needs of entire population of Jahanpanah . 
 = = = <unk> Mosque = = = 
 Now , remnants of the city lie scattered in Begumpur village , as a mute reminder of its ancient glory . The Begumpur Mosque , a vestige of the old city , of overall layout plan of 90 m × 94 m ( 295 @.@ 3 ft × 308 @.@ 4 ft ) size with the inner courtyard measuring 75 m × 80 m ( 246 @.@ 1 ft × 262 @.@ 5 ft ) , is said to be patterned on an Iranian design planned by the Iranian architect Zahir al @-@ Din al @-@ <unk> . A majestic building in the heart of the city with a pride of place played a pivotal role of serving as a madrasa , an administrative centre with the treasury and a mosque of large proportions serving as a social community hub surrounded by a market area . It has an unusual layout with three arch covered passages with a " three by eight " deep nine bay prayer hall on the west . Construction of this mosque is credited to two sources . One view is that it was built by Khan @-@ i @-@ Jahan <unk> <unk> , Prime Minister during Feroz Shah Tughlaq ’ s rule , who was also builder of six more <unk> ( two of them in the close vicinity ) . The other view is that it was built by Tughlaq because of its proximity to Bijay Mandal and could probably be dated to 1351 A.D. , the year Tughlaq died here . In support of the second view , it is said that Ibn Batuta , the chronicler of the period ( till his departure from Delhi in 1341 A.D. ) had not recorded this monument . The Mosque considered an architectural masterpiece ( see pictures in gallery ) has three gates , one in each of the three covered passages , in North , East ( main gate ) and South directions . The west wall which has the Mihrab , has <unk> style tapering minarets flanking the central high opening covered by a big dome . The entire passageway of the west wall has twenty @-@ five arched openings . The Mihrab wall depicts five projections . The prayer hall has modest decorative carvings but the columns and walls are bland . The eastern gate approach is from the road level up a flight of steps to negotiate the raised plinth on which this unique mosque has been built with a four Iwan layout . Stone <unk> or eaves can also be seen on all the four arcades . The Northern entry with 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) raised entrance , probably linked the Mosque to the <unk> Palace . The stucco plastering work on the mosque walls have lasted for centuries and even now show some tiles fixed on them at a few locations . The mosque was under occupation during Jahanpanah 's existence till the 17th century . In the later period , <unk> had occupied the mosque but were cleared by the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) in 1921 . A shuttered by lane entry from the north has been interpreted as an approach that was used by the womenfolk of the Sultan 's family for attending prayers in the mosque . 
 = = = Bijay Mandal = = = 
 Bijay Mandal is a building with a layout plan of 74 m ( 242 @.@ 8 ft ) <unk> m ( 269 @.@ 0 ft ) dimensions , with a well proportioned square dome . It cannot be categorized as a tower or a palace . It is a typical <unk> structure with an octagonal plan built in rubble masonry ( with massive battered sloping walls on east , west and southern directions ) on a raised platform with door ways in each cardinal direction . The purpose of this unusual structure and the ruins of the Sar Dara Palace was described by Ibn Battuta as the palace with multiple chambers and the large public audience hall as the famed Hazar Sutan Palace . It was also interpreted as serving as an observation tower to monitor the activities of his troops . The ambience of the place presented it as place to relax and enjoy the scenic view of the environs . The inclined path around the monument was a walkway leading to the apartments of the Sultan . Two large openings in the living rooms of the floor were inferred as leading to the vaults or the treasury . On the level platform , outside the building in front of the apartment rooms , small holes equally spaced are seen , which have been inferred to be holes used to fix wooden pillars to hold a temporary <unk> ( pavilion ) or cover . The process of ushering people into the presence of the Sultan was devious and formal involving entry through semi – public places to private chambers to the audience hall . The debate on whether the Hazara Sutan Palace cited as existing during Allauddin Khilji reign and also during <unk> 's time are one and the same palace , has not been conclusive . A plausible hypothesis is that the stone hall of the palace was built by Allauddin Khilji while the tower adjoining the stone buildings was surely built by Mohammed bin <unk> . 
 Archaeological excavations carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India unearthed treasures from the vaults in the buildings , which date the occupation of this monument during <unk> Shah ’ s reign and also by Sheikh Hasan Tahir ( a saint ) during Sikander Lodi ’ s rule at the beginning of the 16th century . Also , excavations done in 1934 have revealed wooden pillar bases attributed to the Hazar Sutan Palace . Within the close precincts of the Bijaymandal , a domed building is seen which has a unique architectural façade of two openings on each of its three sides , interpreted as an annex to another building ( based on underground passages seen in the adjoining structure ) . However , the purpose for which this dome was built is not known . 
 <unk> Masjid 
 <unk> Masjid is located 500 m ( 1 @,@ 640 @.@ 4 ft ) to the north of the Bijaymandal but it is in a highly dilapidated state ( pictured ) needing urgent attention for restoration in view of its heritage monument status . At present , it is occupied as a residential complex by a few families . The Masjid was built by the famous builder of Mosques Khan @-@ i @-@ Jahan <unk> <unk> , Prime Minister during Feroz Shah Tughlaq ’ s reign , as one of his seven mosques ; built in the same architectural style as the other six built by him . But even now the visible decorations of the mihrab appear to be more intricate than in his other mosques . When built with rubble masonry and plastered , the mosque had seven arched openings as the frontage , three bays depth wise and crowned by a sequence of low domes in typical <unk> architectural style . 
 = = = Serai Shaji Mahal = = = 
 Further to the east of Begumpur Masjid , in the Serai Shahji village , Mughal period buildings are seen of which the Serai Shaji Mahal is a distinguishing monument . The area surrounding this is scattered with decrepit gates , graves and a large slum area . A little distance from this place is the tomb of Shiekh Farid Murtaza Khan , who during Emperor Akbar ’ s period , was credited with building a number of Serai 's , a mosque and Faridabad village , which is now the present – day large city in Haryana .

 Other notable structures in the Jahanpanah ’ s ambit of 20 ha ( 49 @.@ 4 acres ) area in close vicinity of the present day <unk> Public School are the following : 
 The Lal Gumbad , was built as a tomb for Shaikh <unk> <unk> ( 1397 ) , a <unk> saint who lived in the 14th century as a disciple of Sufi saint Shaikh <unk> <unk> – i – Delhi . The dome tomb was built with red sandstone . It is considered to be a small size replica of the Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq ’ s Tomb in Tughlaqabad . The gateway to the tomb has a pointed arch with marble bands . It is also called the <unk> Gumbad because dacoits had stolen the finial on the roof of the tomb by climbing up over the iron rungs ( called ' <unk> ' ) on its western wall . Apart from these structures , the four walls of a mosque also are within the compound wall of the tomb . 
 The Sadhana Enclave are features Baradari an arched hall . Thought to have been built in the 14th century or 15th century , it is in a fairly well preserved condition . A Lodi period tomb is also seen nearby . 
 Further away from the Sadhana enclave on its opposite side , in Shiekh Serai , three tombs are noted of which only one is well preserved , the squared domed tomb of Sheikh Alauddin ( 1541 – 42 ) . The tomb building is raised on twelve columns with perforated screens on the façade has a large dome , creating a drum with sixteen faces . The ceiling of the tomb is well decorated with medallions in plaster on the spandrel of arches and within the parapets a <unk> design .

 Archaeological excavations were done by ASI in part of the fort walls at its junction with the eastern wall of Qila Rai Pithora . The excavations revealed rough and small stones in the foundations followed by an ashlar face in the exterior wall above ground .

 = Roon @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Roon class was a pair of armored cruisers built for the German Imperial Navy after the turn of the 20th century . The class comprised Roon and Yorck , which closely resembled the earlier Prinz Adalbert @-@ class ships , but incorporated slight incremental improvements . The ships were easily distinguished from their predecessors by the addition of a fourth funnel . Like all of the armored cruisers built by Germany , they were intended to serve as station ships in Germany 's overseas possessions . The ships did not compare well with their British rivals . 
 The two ships served with the High Seas Fleet in the reconnaissance squadrons after they joined the fleet in 1905 – 1906 . At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , the ships served alongside the more powerful battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group . While returning to port after a raid of the English coast on 16 December 1914 , Yorck struck German mines and sank with heavy loss of life . Roon was disarmed in 1916 and intended to be converted into a seaplane carrier , though this was never carried out . The ship was eventually broken up for scrap in 1921 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Design work on Roon and her sister ship Yorck was completed in 1901 . The design for the Roon class can be traced back to the first German armored cruiser , Fürst Bismarck , built between 1896 – 1900 , and the preceding Victoria Louise class of protected cruisers that came before it . The German armored cruisers were designed for overseas service , specifically to serve as station ships in the German colonies in Africa , Asia , and the Pacific . 
 Roon and her sister Yorck were improved versions of the preceding Prinz Adalbert class . The two ships were slightly larger and faster than the Prinz Adalbert class and had a slightly different armor layout ; the Roon class ships had thinner armor on the turret faces , and slightly thinner armored decks . They shared many of the same layout characteristics as the contemporary German pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , including a smaller main armament but heavier secondary battery than their foreign equivalents . As a result , they compared unfavorably with their British contemporaries . Taylor describes the ships as " poorly protected and not a successful class in service . " 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The ships of the Roon class were 127 @.@ 3 meters ( 418 ft ) long at the waterline and 127 @.@ 8 m ( 419 ft ) overall . They had a beam of 20 @.@ 2 m ( 66 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 76 m ( 25 @.@ 5 ft ) . Roon and Yorck displaced 9 @,@ 533 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 382 long tons ; 10 @,@ 508 short tons ) normally , and 10 @,@ 266 metric tons ( 10 @,@ 104 long tons ; 11 @,@ 316 short tons ) at full load . Their hulls were constructed from transverse and longitudinal steel frames that formed a structure over which the steel hull plates were riveted . The hulls contained 12 watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 60 percent of the length of the ship . 
 Like the preceding Prinz Adalbert @-@ class ships , Roon and Yorck were good sea boats ; when the fuel bunkers were full they had a gentle motion . They also maneuvered well and were responsive to the helm . With the rudder hard over , the ships lost up to 60 percent speed . The ships ' casemates were placed too low , and as a result they were exceedingly wet ; the casemate guns were impossible to use in heavy seas . They had a metacentric height of 1 @.@ 04 m ( 3 @.@ 4 ft ) . The ships ' standard complements numbered some 35 officers and 598 enlisted men . While serving as a squadron flagship the crew was augmented by 13 officers and 62 men , and as a second command ship by 9 officers and 44 sailors . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Roon and Yorck were powered by the same engine system as the preceding class , three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines , each of which drove one of the ships ' three screws . The central screw was 4 @.@ 5 m ( 15 ft ) in diameter , and the outer screws were 4 @.@ 8 m ( 16 ft ) . Steam was provided to the engines by 16 boilers built by Düsseldorf @-@ Ratinger Röhrenkesselfabrik ( Dürr ) . Each boiler had 4 fireboxes apiece for a total of 48 . The propulsion system produced 19 @,@ 000 ihp ( 14 @,@ 200 kW ) , which delivered a top speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ) . The ships had four turbo generators , which provided 260 kilowatts at 110 volts . The ships had a single rudder . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships ' primary armament consisted of four 21 @-@ centimeter ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) SK L / 40 guns mounted in two twin turrets , one fore and one aft . These guns fired a 108 @-@ kilogram ( 238 lb ) armor @-@ piercing shell at a muzzle velocity of 780 meters ( 2 @,@ 560 ft ) per second , for a maximum range of 12 @,@ 300 m ( 13 @,@ 500 yd ) with their original maximum elevation of 16 degrees . The guns were later improved to 30 degrees , which extended the maximum range to 16 @,@ 200 m ( 17 @,@ 700 yd ) . 
 Secondary armament included ten 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 40 guns in single turrets and casemates and fourteen 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 35 guns , also casemated . The 15 cm guns fired a 40 kg ( 88 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 800 m ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) per second . The guns could be elevated to 30 degrees , which provided a maximum range of 13 @,@ 900 m ( 15 @,@ 200 yd ) . The 8 @.@ 8 cm guns fired a 7 kg ( 15 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 770 m ( 2 @,@ 530 ft ) per second . These guns had a maximum elevation of 25 degrees and a range of 9 @,@ 100 m ( 10 @,@ 000 yd ) . The ships were also equipped with four 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 This armament was identical to that on the preceding Prinz Adalbert class , with the exception of ammunition stores . The Roon @-@ class ships carried 380 shells for the main battery , 1 @,@ 600 rounds for the 15 cm guns , and 2 @,@ 100 shells for the 8 @.@ 8 cm guns . The planned conversion for Roon to a seaplane carrier called for six 15 cm L / 45 guns and six 8 @.@ 8 cm Flak guns , with 2 @,@ 400 rounds , though this was never carried out . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 Roon and Yorck were protected by Krupp cemented steel armor . At the waterline , their armored belt was 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick amidships where the ships ' vitals were located . This was decreased slightly to 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) on either end of the central section of the belt . The belt was backed by 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) of teak planking . At the casemate deck the side armor was also 100 mm thick . The armored deck ranged in thickness from 40 – 60 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) and was connected to the belt by sloped armor that was 40 – 50 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . 
 The forward conning tower had 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and a 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick roof . The rear conning tower was less well @-@ protected ; its sides were only 80 mm thick and its roof was 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick . The main battery gun turrets were armored with 150 mm thick steel plates on the sides and 30 mm thick roofs . The 15 cm turrets were protected by 100 mm thick sides and 80 mm thick gun shields .

 After commissioning into the fleet , Roon was assigned to the I Scouting Group . In 1908 , she served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Jacobsen in the second division . Roon served here until 1912 when she was replaced by the new battlecruiser Moltke . 
 At the start of World War I , Roon was serving as the flagship of the III Scouting Group . The ship participated in several actions during World War I , including the raid on Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby , during which she served in the cruiser screen for the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet . Roon also conducted operations against Russian forces in the Baltic Sea , including bombardments against the Russian positions at Libau in support of the army in May 1915 . The Battle of the Åland Islands took place between Roon and several other German cruisers and Russian forces led by the powerful cruiser <unk> in July 1915 . In August Roon and Prinz Heinrich bombarded Russian positions in the Baltic and briefly engaged several Russian destroyers . 
 After 1916 , Roon was disarmed and used as a guard ship and floating barracks in Kiel until the end of the war . Design work commenced in 1916 to convert the ship into a seaplane carrier ; work was planned to last from 1917 to 1918 during a period of 20 months . The ship was struck from the naval register on 25 November 1920 and scrapped the following year at Kiel @-@ Nordmole . 
 = = = SMS Yorck = = = 
 Yorck also served in the I Scouting Group with her sister ship , in the second division . In 1908 , the ship won the annual " Kaiser 's Challenge Cups for Prize Firing " for the reconnaissance squadron . In 1911 , the ship came under the command of Franz von Hipper , who would go on to command the I Scouting Group during the war . Hipper held this position aboard Yorck from 1 October 1911 to 26 January 1912 . In early 1912 the ship was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to the new battlecruiser Seydlitz . 
 The ship had a short career during World War I. At the outbreak of war , Yorck was brought out of the reserve fleet and joined her sistership Roon in the III Scouting Group . After the raid on Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby , the ship made a navigational error upon returning to the <unk> , and accidentally sailed into a German defensive minefield . The ship sank quickly and only 127 men of her complement of 629 were rescued . The wreck was cleared over several periods between 1929 and the mid @-@ 1980s . The first period of work lasted from 1929 – 30 ; work commenced briefly in 1965 . The final work on removing the ship began in 1982 . 
 = Haymarket affair = 
 The Haymarket affair ( also known as the Haymarket massacre or Haymarket riot ) was the aftermath of a bombing that took place at a labor demonstration on Tuesday May 4 , 1886 , at Haymarket Square in Chicago . It began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for an eight @-@ hour day and in reaction to the killing of several workers the previous day by the police . An unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at police as they acted to disperse the public meeting . The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians ; scores of others were wounded . 
 In the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed , eight anarchists were convicted of conspiracy . The evidence was that one of the defendants may have built the bomb , but none of those on trial had thrown it . Seven were sentenced to death and one to a term of 15 years in prison . The death sentences of two of the defendants were commuted by Illinois governor Richard J. Oglesby to terms of life in prison , and another committed suicide in jail rather than face the gallows . The other four were hanged on November 11 , 1887 . In 1893 , Illinois ' new governor John Peter Altgeld pardoned the remaining defendants and criticized the trial . 
 The Haymarket affair is generally considered significant as the origin of international May Day observances for workers . The site of the incident was designated a Chicago Landmark in 1992 , and a public sculpture was dedicated there in 2004 . In addition , the Haymarket Martyrs ' Monument at the defendants ' burial site in nearby Forest Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997 . 
 " No single event has influenced the history of labor in Illinois , the United States , and even the world , more than the Chicago Haymarket Affair . It began with a rally on May 4 , 1886 , but the consequences are still being felt today . Although the rally is included in American history textbooks , very few present the event accurately or point out its significance , " according to labor studies professor William J. Adelman . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the Civil War , particularly following the Depression of 1873 – 79 , there was a rapid expansion of industrial production in the United States . Chicago was a major industrial center and tens of thousands of German and Bohemian immigrants were employed at about $ 1 @.@ 50 a day . American workers worked on average slightly over 60 hours , during a six @-@ day work week . The city became a center for many attempts to organize labor 's demands for better working conditions . Employers responded with anti @-@ union measures , such as firing and blacklisting union members , locking out workers , recruiting strikebreakers ; employing spies , thugs , and private security forces and exacerbating ethnic tensions in order to divide the workers . Mainstream newspapers supported business interests , and were opposed by the labor and immigrant press . During the economic slowdown between 1882 and 1886 , socialist and anarchist organizations were active . Membership of the Knights of Labor , which rejected socialism and radicalism , but supported the 8 @-@ hour work day , grew from 70 @,@ 000 in 1884 to over 700 @,@ 000 by 1886 . In Chicago , the anarchist movement of several thousand , mostly immigrant , workers centered about the German @-@ language newspaper Arbeiter @-@ Zeitung ( " Workers ' Times " ) , edited by August Spies . Other anarchists operated a militant revolutionary force with an armed section that was equipped with guns and explosives . Its revolutionary strategy centered around the belief that successful operations against the police and the seizure of major industrial centers would result in massive public support by workers , revolution , destroy capitalism , and establish a socialist economy . 
 = = = May Day parade and strikes = = = 
 In October 1884 , a convention held by the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions unanimously set May 1 , 1886 , as the date by which the eight @-@ hour work day would become standard . As the chosen date approached , U.S. labor unions prepared for a general strike in support of the eight @-@ hour day . 
 On Saturday , May 1 , thousands of workers went on strike and rallies were held throughout the United States , with the cry , " Eight @-@ hour day with no cut in pay . " Estimates of the number of striking workers across the U.S. range from 300 @,@ 000 to half a million . In New York City the number of demonstrators was estimated at 10 @,@ 000 and in Detroit at 11 @,@ 000 . In Milwaukee , Wisconsin , some 10 @,@ 000 workers turned out . In Chicago , the movement 's center , an estimated 30 @,@ 000 @-@ to @-@ 40 @,@ 000 workers had gone on strike and there were perhaps twice as many people out on the streets participating in various demonstrations and marches , as , for example , a march by 10 @,@ 000 men employed in the Chicago lumber yards . Though participants in these events added up to 80 @,@ 000 , it is disputed whether there was a march of that number down Michigan Avenue led by anarchist Albert Parsons , founder of the International Working People 's Association [ <unk> ] and his wife Lucy and their children . 
 On May 3 , striking workers in Chicago met near the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant . Union <unk> at the plant had been locked out since early February and the predominantly Irish @-@ American workers at McCormick had come under attack from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885 . This event , along with the eight @-@ hour militancy of McCormick workers , had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city . By the time of the 1886 general strike , strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers . Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1 , McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed the picket lines . 
 Speaking to a rally outside the plant on May 3 , August Spies advised the striking workers to " hold together , to stand by their union , or they would not succeed . " Well @-@ planned and coordinated , the general strike to this point had remained largely nonviolent . When the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ workday bell sounded , however , a group of workers surged to the gates to confront the strikebreakers . Despite calls for calm by Spies , the police fired on the crowd . Two McCormick workers were killed ( although some newspaper accounts said there were six fatalities ) . Spies would later testify , " I was very indignant . I knew from experience of the past that this butchering of people was done for the express purpose of defeating the eight @-@ hour movement . " 
 Outraged by this act of police violence , local anarchists quickly printed and distributed fliers calling for a rally the following day at Haymarket Square ( also called the Haymarket ) , which was then a bustling commercial center near the corner of Randolph Street and <unk> Street . Printed in German and English , the fliers claimed that the police had murdered the strikers on behalf of business interests and urged workers to seek justice . The first batch of fliers contain the words Workingmen Arm <unk> and Appear in Full Force ! When Spies saw the line , he said he would not speak at the rally unless the words were removed from the flier . All but a few hundred of the fliers were destroyed , and new fliers were printed without the offending words . More than 20 @,@ 000 copies of the revised flier were distributed . 
 = = = Rally at Haymarket Square = = = 
 The rally began peacefully under a light rain on the evening of May 4 . August Spies , Albert Parsons , and Samuel Fielden spoke to a crowd estimated variously between 600 and 3 @,@ 000 while standing in an open wagon adjacent to the square on Des Plaines Street . A large number of on @-@ duty police officers watched from nearby . 
 Paul Avrich , a historian specializing in the study of anarchism , quotes Spies as saying : 
 There seems to prevail the opinion in some quarters that this meeting has been called for the purpose of inaugurating a riot , hence these warlike preparations on the part of so @-@ called ' law and order . ' However , let me tell you at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose . The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight @-@ hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it . 
 Following Spies ' speech , the crowd was addressed by Parsons , the Alabama @-@ born editor of the radical English @-@ language weekly The Alarm . The crowd was so calm that Mayor Carter Harrison , Sr. , who had stopped by to watch , walked home early . Parsons spoke for almost an hour before standing down in favor of the last speaker of the evening , the British socialist Samuel Fielden , who delivered a brief ten @-@ minute address . Many of the crowd had already left as the weather was deteriorating . 
 A New York Times article , with the dateline May 4 , and headlined " Rioting and Bloodshed in the Streets of Chicago ... Twelve Policemen Dead or Dying " , reported that Fielden spoke for 20 minutes , alleging that his words grew " wilder and more violent as he proceeded " . Another New York Times article , headlined " Anarchy ’ s Red Hand " and dated May 6 , opens with : " The villainous teachings of the Anarchists bore bloody fruit in Chicago tonight and before daylight at least a dozen stalwart men will have laid down their lives as a tribute to the doctrine of Herr Johann Most . " It refers to the strikers as a " mob " and uses quotation marks around the term " workingmen " . 
 = = = = Bombing and gunfire = = = = 
 At about 10 : 30 pm , just as Fielden was finishing his speech , police arrived en masse , marching in formation towards the speakers ' wagon , and ordered the rally to disperse . Fielden insisted that the meeting was peaceful . Police Inspector John Bonfield , proclaimed : 
 I command you [ addressing the speaker ] in the name of the law to desist and you [ addressing the crowd ] to disperse . 
 A home @-@ made bomb with a brittle metal casing filled with dynamite and ignited by a fuse , was thrown into the path of the advancing police . Its fuse briefly sputtered , then the bomb exploded , killing policeman Mathias J. Degan with flying metal fragments and mortally wounding six other officers . 
 Witnesses maintained that immediately after the bomb blast there was an exchange of gunshots between police and demonstrators . Accounts vary widely as to who fired first and whether any of the crowd fired at the police . Historian Paul Avrich maintains that the police fired on the fleeing demonstrators , reloaded and then fired again , killing four and wounding as many as 70 people . What is not disputed is that in less than five minutes the square was empty except for the casualties . According to the May 4 New York Times demonstrators began firing at the police , who then returned fire . In his report on the incident , Inspector Bonfield wrote that he " gave the order to cease firing , fearing that some of our men , in the darkness might fire into each other " . An anonymous police official told the Chicago Tribune , " A very large number of the police were wounded by each other 's revolvers . ... It was every man for himself , and while some got two or three squares away , the rest emptied their revolvers , mainly into each other . " 
 In all , seven policemen and at least four workers were killed . Another policeman died two years after the incident from complications related to injuries received on that day . About 60 policemen were wounded in the incident . They were carried , along with some other wounded people , into a nearby police station . Police captain Michael Schaack later wrote that the number of wounded workers was " largely in excess of that on the side of the police " . The Chicago Herald described a scene of " wild carnage " and estimated at least fifty dead or wounded civilians lay in the streets . It is unclear how many civilians were wounded since many were afraid to seek medical attention , fearing arrest . They found aid where they could . 
 = = = Aftermath and red scare = = = 
 A harsh anti @-@ union clampdown followed the Haymarket incident . There was a massive outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts . The entire labor and immigrant community , particularly Germans and Bohemians , came under suspicion . Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists . Scores of suspects , many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair , were arrested . Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside , Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight @-@ week shakedown , ransacking their meeting halls and places of business . The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper , Arbeiter @-@ Zeitung . A small group of anarchists were discovered to have been engaged in making bombs on the same day as the incident , including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square . 
 Newspaper reports declared that anarchist agitators were to blame for the " riot " , a view adopted by an alarmed public . As time passed , press reports and illustrations of the incident became more elaborate . Coverage was national , then international . Among property owners , the press , and other elements of society , a consensus developed that suppression of anarchist agitation was necessary . While for their part , union organizations such as The Knights of Labor and craft unions were quick to disassociate themselves from the anarchist movement and to repudiate violent tactics as self @-@ defeating . Many workers , on the other hand , believed that men of the Pinkerton agency were responsible because of the agency 's tactic of secretly infiltrating labor groups and its sometimes violent methods of strike breaking .

 The police assumed that an anarchist had thrown the bomb as part of a planned conspiracy ; their problem was how to prove it . On the morning of May 5 , they raided the offices of the Arbeiter @-@ Zeitung , arresting its editor August Spies , and his brother ( who was not charged ) . Also arrested were editorial assistant Michael Schwab and Adolph Fischer , a typesetter . A search of the premises resulted in the discovery of the " Revenge Poster " and other evidence considered incriminating by the prosecution . 
 On May 7 police searched the premises of Louis Lingg where they found a number of bombs and bomb @-@ making materials . Lingg 's landlord William Seliger was also arrested but cooperated with police and identified Lingg as a bomb maker and was not charged . An associate of Spies , Balthazar Rau , suspected as the bomber , was traced to Omaha and brought back to Chicago . After interrogation , Rau offered to cooperate with police . He alleged that the defendants had experimented with dynamite bombs and accused them of having published what he said was a code word , " Ruhe " ( " peace " ) , in the Arbeiter @-@ Zeitung as a call to arms at Haymarket Square . 
 = = = The defendants = = = 
 Rudolf Schnaubelt , the police ’ s lead suspect as the bomb thrower , was arrested twice early on and released . By May 14 , when it became apparent he had played a significant role in the event , he had fled the country . William Seliger , who had turned state 's evidence and testified for the prosecution , was not charged . On June 4 , 1886 , seven other suspects , however , were indicted by the grand jury and stood trial for being accessories to the murder of Degan . Of these , only two had been present when the bomb exploded . Newspaper editor August Spies and Samuel Fielden had spoken at the peaceful rally and were stepping down from the speaker 's wagon in compliance with police orders to disperse just before the bomb went off . Two others had been present at the beginning of the rally but had left and were at <unk> 's Hall , an anarchist rendezvous , at the time of the explosion . They were : Arbeiter @-@ Zeitung typesetter Adolph Fischer and the well @-@ known activist Albert Parsons , who had spoken for an hour at the Haymarket rally before going to <unk> 's . Parsons , who believed that the evidence against them all was weak , subsequently voluntarily turned himself in , in solidarity with the accused . A third man , Spies 's assistant editor Michael Schwab ( who was the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Schnaubelt ) was arrested since he was speaking at another rally at the time of the bombing ( he was also later pardoned ) . Not directly tied to the Haymarket rally , but arrested because they were notorious for their militant radicalism were George Engel ( who was at home playing cards on that day ) , and Louis Lingg , the hot @-@ headed bomb maker denounced by his associate , Seliger . Another defendant who had not been present that day was Oscar Neebe , an American @-@ born citizen of German descent who was associated with the Arbeiter @-@ Zeitung and had attempted to revive it in the aftermath of the Haymarket riot . 
 Of the eight defendants , five – Spies , Fischer , Engel , Lingg and Schwab – were German @-@ born immigrants ; a sixth , Neebe , was a U.S.-born citizen of German descent . Only the remaining two , Parsons and Fielden , born in the U.S. and England , respectively , were of British heritage . 
 = = = Trial = = = 
 The trial , Illinois vs. August Spies et al . , began on June 21 , 1886 , and went on until August 11 . The trial was conducted in an atmosphere of extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants . It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary . Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants , consistently ruled for the prosecution , and failed to maintain decorum . A motion to try the defendants separately was denied . The defense counsel included Sigmund <unk> , William Perkins Black , William Foster , and Moses Salomon . Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult , lasting three weeks , and nearly one thousand people called . All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed . In the end a jury of 12 was seated , most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants . Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it , refusing to dismiss for prejudice . Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted . Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed , a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random . The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants . The prosecution , led by Julius Grinnell , argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb , they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators . The jury heard the testimony of 118 people , including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden , Schwab , Spies and Parsons . Albert Parsons ' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb . This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers . 
 Police investigators under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment removed from a policeman 's wounds chemically analyzed . They reported that the lead used in the casing matched the casings of bombs found in Lingg 's home . A metal nut and fragments of the casing taken from the wound also roughly matched bombs made by Lingg . Schaack concluded , on the basis of interviews , that the anarchists had been experimenting for years with dynamite and other explosives , refining the design of their bombs before coming up with the effective one used at the Haymarket . 
 At the last minute , when it was discovered that instructions for manslaughter had not been included in the submitted instructions , the jury was called back , and the instructions were given . 
 = = = Verdict and contemporary reactions = = = 
 The jury returned guilty verdicts for all eight defendants . Before being sentenced , Neebe told the court that Schaack 's officers were among the city 's worst gangs , ransacking houses and stealing money and watches . Schaack laughed and Neebe retorted , " You need not laugh about it , Captain Schaack . You are one of them . You are an anarchist , as you understand it . You are all anarchists , in this sense of the word , I must say . " Judge Gary sentenced seven of the defendants to death by hanging and Neebe to 15 years in prison . The sentencing provoked outrage from labor and workers ' movements and their supporters , resulting in protests around the world , and elevating the defendants to the status of martyrs , especially abroad . Portrayals of the anarchists as bloodthirsty foreign fanatics in the press along with the 1889 publication of Captain Schaack 's sensational account , Anarchy and Anarchism , on the other hand , inspired widespread public fear and revulsion against the strikers and general anti @-@ immigrant feeling , polarizing public opinion . 
 In an article <unk> May 4 , entitled " Anarchy ’ s Red Hand " , The New York Times had described the incident as the " bloody fruit " of " the villainous teachings of the Anarchists . " The Chicago Times described the defendants as " arch counselors of riot , pillage , <unk> and murder " ; other reporters described them as " bloody brutes " , " red ruffians " , " <unk> " , " bloody monsters " , " cowards " , " cutthroats " , " thieves " , " assassins " , and " fiends " . The journalist George Frederic Parsons wrote a piece for The Atlantic Monthly in which he identified the fears of middle @-@ class Americans concerning labor radicalism , and asserted that the workers had only themselves to blame for their troubles . Edward Aveling remarked , " If these men are ultimately hanged , it will be the Chicago Tribune that has done it . " Schaack , who had led the investigation , was dismissed from the police force for allegedly having fabricated evidence in the case but was reinstated in 1892 .

 After the appeals had been exhausted , Illinois Governor Richard James Oglesby commuted Fielden 's and Schwab 's sentences to life in prison on November 10 , 1887 .

 The next day ( November 11 , 1887 ) four defendants — Engel , Fischer , Parsons , and Spies — were taken to the gallows in white robes and hoods . They sang the Marseillaise , then the anthem of the international revolutionary movement . Family members including Lucy Parsons , who attempted to see them for the last time , were arrested and searched for bombs ( none were found ) . According to witnesses , in the moments before the men were hanged , Spies shouted , " The time will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today . " In their last words , Engel and Fischer called out , " Hurrah for anarchism ! " Parsons then requested to speak , but he was cut off when the signal was given to open the trap door . Witnesses reported that the condemned men did not die immediately when they dropped , but strangled to death slowly , a sight which left the spectators visibly shaken .

 Notwithstanding the convictions for conspiracy , no actual bomber was ever brought to trial , " and no lawyerly explanation could ever make a conspiracy trial without the main perpetrator in the conspiracy seem completely legitimate . " Historians such as James Joll and Timothy Messer @-@ Kruse say the evidence points to Rudolph Schnaubelt , brother @-@ in @-@ law of Schwab , as the likely perpetrator . Howard Zinn , in A People 's History of the United States also pointed towards Schnaubelt , suggesting he was a provocateur , posing as an anarchist , who threw the bomb so police would have a pretext to arrest leaders of Chicago 's anarchist movement . However , Paul Avrich disputes this claim as being " sheer speculation and utterly without foundation . " Avrich argues that Schnaubelt 's appearance did not match the description of the bomber and that his behavior was inconsistent with either being the culprit or a mole .

 Among supporters of the labor movement in the United States and abroad and others , the trial was widely believed to have been unfair , and even a serious miscarriage of justice . Prominent people such as novelist William Dean Howells ; celebrated attorney Clarence Darrow ; poet and playwright Oscar Wilde ; and playwright George Bernard Shaw strongly condemned it . On June 26 , 1893 , Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld , the progressive governor of Illinois , himself a German immigrant , signed pardons for Fielden , Neebe , and Schwab , calling them victims of " hysteria , packed juries , and a biased judge " and noting that the state " has never discovered who it was that threw the bomb which killed the policeman , and the evidence does not show any connection whatsoever between the defendants and the man who threw it . " Altgeld also faulted the city of Chicago for failing to hold Pinkerton guards responsible for repeated use of lethal violence against striking workers . Altgeld 's actions concerning labor were used to defeat his reelection . 
 Soon after the trial , anarchist Dyer Lum wrote a history of the trial critical of the prosecution . In 1888 , George McLean , and in 1889 , police captain Michael Shack , wrote accounts from the opposite perspective . Awaiting sentencing , each of the defendants wrote their own autobiographies ( edited and published by Philip Foner in 1969 ) , and later activist Lucy Parsons published a biography of her condemned husband Albert Parsons . Fifty years after the event , Henry Davis , wrote a history , which was superseded in another scholarly treatment by Paul Avrich in 1984 , and a " social history " of the era by Bruce C. Nelson in 1988 . In 2006 , labor historian , James Green , wrote a popular history . 
 Christopher <unk> writes in the Encyclopedia of Chicago that lacking credible evidence regarding the bombing , " ... the prosecution focused on the writings and speeches of the defendants . " He further notes that the conspiracy charge was legally unprecedented , the Judge was " partisan , " and all the jurors admitted prejudice against the defendants . Historian Carl Smith writes , " The visceral feelings of fear and anger surrounding the trial ruled out anything but the pretense of justice right from the outset . " Smith notes that scholars have long considered the trial a " notorious " " miscarriage of justice . " In a review somewhat more critical of the defendants , historian Jon <unk> concludes that " [ t ] he tragedy of Haymarket is the American justice system did not protect the damn fools who most needed that protection ... It is the damn fools who talk too much and too wildly who are most in need of protection from the state . " In 2011 , labor historian Timothy Messer @-@ Kruse published a history . Based on his examination of the trial transcripts and other archival material , he concludes there is abundant evidence connecting defendants to advocacy of violence and preparations for it . He argues that Chicago 's anarchists were indeed " part of an international terrorist network and did hatch a conspiracy to attack police with bombs and guns that May Day weekend " ; and he calls the evidence establishing the guilt of " most of the defendants " " overwhelming . " Moreover , Messer @-@ Kruse opines that the trial was fair " by the standards of the age " and the jury representative . According to him , " The tragic end of the story was the product not of prosecutorial eagerness to see the anarchists hang , but largely due to a combination of the incompetence of the defendant 's lawyers and their willingness to use the trial to vindicate anarchism rather than to save the necks of their clients . " 
 During the late 20th century , scholars doing research into the Haymarket affair were surprised to learn that much of the primary source documentation relating to the incident ( beside materials concerning the trial ) was not in Chicago , but had been transferred to then @-@ communist East Berlin . 
 = = Effects on the labor movement and May Day = = 
 The Haymarket affair was a setback for the American labor movement and its fight for the eight @-@ hour day . Yet it also can be seen as strengthening its resistance , especially in Chicago , where , as historian Nathan Fine points out , trade union activities continued to show signs of growth and vitality , culminating later in 1886 with the establishment of the Labor Party of Chicago . 
 Fine observes : 
 [ T ] he fact is that despite police repression , newspaper incitement to hysteria , and organization of the possessing classes , which followed the throwing of the bomb on May 4 , the Chicago wage earners only united their forces and stiffened their resistance . The conservative and radical central bodies – there were two each of the trade unions and two also of the Knights of Labor — the socialists and the anarchists , the single <unk> and the reformers , the native born ... and the foreign born Germans , Bohemians , and Scandinavians , all got together for the first time on the political field in the summer following the Haymarket affair .... [ T ] he Knights of Labor doubled its membership , reaching 40 @,@ 000 in the fall of 1886 . On Labor Day the number of Chicago workers in parade led the country . 
 On the first anniversary of the event , May 4 , 1887 , the New @-@ York Tribune published an interview with Senator Leland Stanford , in which he addressed the consensus that " the conflict between capital and labor is intensifying " and articulated the vision advocated by the Knights of Labor for an industrial system of worker @-@ owned co @-@ operatives , another among the strategies pursued to advance the conditions of laborers . The interview was republished as a pamphlet to include the bill Stanford introduced in the Senate to foster co @-@ operatives . 
 Popular pressure continued for the establishment of the 8 @-@ hour day . At the convention of the American Federation of Labor ( AFL ) in 1888 , the union decided to campaign for the shorter workday again . May 1 , 1890 , was agreed upon as the date on which workers would strike for an eight @-@ hour work day . 
 In 1889 , AFL president Samuel Gompers wrote to the first congress of the Second International , which was meeting in Paris . He informed the world 's socialists of the AFL 's plans and proposed an international fight for a universal eight @-@ hour work day . In response to Gompers 's letter , the Second International adopted a resolution calling for " a great international demonstration " on a single date so workers everywhere could demand the eight @-@ hour work day . In light of the Americans ' plan , the International adopted May 1 , 1890 as the date for this demonstration . 
 A secondary purpose behind the adoption of the resolution by the Second International was to honor the memory of the Haymarket martyrs and other workers who had been killed in association with the strikes on May 1 , 1886 . Historian Philip Foner writes " [ t ] here is little doubt that everyone associated with the resolution passed by the Paris Congress knew of the May 1 demonstrations and strikes for the eight @-@ hour day in 1886 in the United States ... and the events associated with the Haymarket tragedy . " 
 The first international May Day was a spectacular success . The front page of the New York World on May 2 , 1890 , was devoted to coverage of the event . Two of its headlines were " Parade of <unk> Workingmen in All the Trade Centers of the Civilized World " and " Everywhere the Workmen Join in Demands for a Normal Day . " The Times of London listed two dozen European cities in which demonstrations had taken place , noting there had been rallies in Cuba , Peru and Chile . Commemoration of May Day became an annual event the following year . 
 The association of May Day with the Haymarket martyrs has remained strong in Mexico . Mary Harris " Mother " Jones was in Mexico on May 1 , 1921 , and wrote of the " day of ' fiestas ' " that marked " the killing of the workers in Chicago for demanding the eight @-@ hour day " . In 1929 The New York Times referred to the May Day parade in Mexico City as " the annual demonstration glorifying the memory of those who were killed in Chicago in 1887 . " The New York Times described the 1936 demonstration as a commemoration of " the death of the martyrs in Chicago . " In 1939 Oscar Neebe 's grandson attended the May Day parade in Mexico City and was shown , as his host told him , " how the world shows respect to your grandfather " . 
 The influence of the Haymarket affair was not limited to the celebration of May Day . Emma Goldman , the activist and political theorist , was attracted to anarchism after reading about the incident and the executions , which she later described as " the events that had inspired my spiritual birth and growth . " She considered the Haymarket martyrs to be " the most decisive influence in my existence " . Her associate , Alexander Berkman also described the Haymarket anarchists as " a potent and vital inspiration . " Others whose commitment to anarchism crystallized as a result of the Haymarket affair included Voltairine de Cleyre and " Big Bill " Haywood , a founding member of the Industrial Workers of the World . Goldman wrote to historian Max Nettlau that the Haymarket affair had awakened the social consciousness of " hundreds , perhaps thousands , of people " . 
 = = Suspected bombers = = 
 While admitting none of the defendants were involved in the bombing , the prosecution made the argument that Lingg had built the bomb and two prosecution witnesses ( Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson ) tried to imply the bomb thrower was helped by Spies , Fischer and Schwab . The defendants claimed they had no knowledge of the bomber at all . 
 Several activists , including Dyer Lum ( a close associate of the defendants who wrote an account of the case in 1891 ) , Voltairine de Cleyre and Robert Reitzel , later hinted they knew who the bomber was . Writers and other commentators have speculated about many possible suspects : 
 Rudolph Schnaubelt ( 1863 – 1901 ) was an activist and the brother @-@ in law of Michael Schwab . He was at the Haymarket when the bomb exploded . Schnaubelt was indicted with the other defendants but fled the city and later the country before he could be brought to trial . He was the detectives ' lead suspect , and state witness Gilmer testified he saw Schnaubelt throw the bomb , identifying him from a photograph in court . Schnaubelt later sent two letters from London disclaiming all responsibility , writing , " If I had really thrown this bomb , surely I would have nothing to be ashamed of , but in truth I never once thought of it . " He is the most generally accepted and widely known suspect and figured as the bomb thrower in The Bomb , Frank Harris 's 1908 fictionalization of the tragedy . Written from Schnaubelt 's point of view , the story opens with him confessing on his deathbed . However , Harris 's description was fictional and those who knew Schnaubelt vehemently criticized the book . 
 George Schwab was a German shoemaker who died in 1924 . German anarchist Carl Nold claimed he learned Schwab was the bomber through correspondence with other activists but no proof ever emerged . Historian Paul Avrich also suspected him but noted that while Schwab was in Chicago , he had only arrived days before . This contradicted statements by others that the bomber was a well @-@ known figure in Chicago . 
 George Meng ( b. around 1840 ) was a German anarchist and teamster who owned a small farm outside of Chicago where he had settled in 1883 after emigrating from Bavaria . Like Parsons and Spies , he was a delegate at the Pittsburgh Congress and a member of the <unk> . Meng 's granddaughter , Adah Maurer , wrote Paul Avrich a letter in which she said that her mother , who was 15 at the time of the bombing , told her that her father was the bomber . Meng died sometime before 1907 in a saloon fire . Based on his correspondence with Maurer , Avrich concluded that there was a " strong possibility " that the little @-@ known Meng may have been the bomber . 
 An agent provocateur was suggested by some members of the anarchist movement . Albert Parsons believed the bomber was a member of the police or the Pinkertons trying to undermine the labor movement . However , this contradicts the statements of several activists who said the bomber was one of their own . Lucy Parsons and Johann Most rejected this notion . Dyer Lum said it was " puerile " to ascribe " the Haymarket bomb to a Pinkerton . " 
 A disgruntled worker was widely suspected . When Adolph Fischer was asked if he knew who threw the bomb , he answered , " I suppose it was some excited workingman . " Oscar Neebe said it was a " crank . " Governor Altgeld speculated the bomb thrower might have been a disgruntled worker who was not associated with the defendants or the anarchist movement but had a personal grudge against the police . In his pardoning statement , Altgeld said the record of police brutality towards the workers had invited revenge adding , " Capt. Bonfield is the man who is really responsible for the deaths of the police officers . " 
 <unk> Schuetz was identified as the bomber by Franz Mayhoff , a New York anarchist and fraudster , who claimed in an affidavit that Schuetz had once admitted throwing the Haymarket bomb . August Wagener , Mayhoff 's attorney , sent a telegram from New York to defense attorney Captain William Black the day before the executions claiming knowledge of the bomber 's identity . Black tried to delay the execution with this telegram but Governor Oglesby refused . It was later learned that Schuetz was the primary witness against Mayhoff at his trial for insurance fraud , so Mayhoff 's affidavit has never been regarded as credible by historians . 
 Thomas Owen was a carpenter from Pennsylvania . Severely injured in an accident a week before the executions , Owen reportedly confessed to the bombing on his deathbed by saying , " I was at the Haymarket riot and am an anarchist and say that I threw a bomb in that riot . " He was an anarchist and apparently had been in Chicago at the time but other accounts note that long before his accident he had said he was at the Haymarket and saw the bomb thrower . Owen may have been trying to save the condemned men . 
 <unk> " Big " Krueger was killed by police either in the melee after the bombing or in a separate disturbance the next day and has been named as a suspect but there is no supporting evidence . 
 A mysterious outsider was reported by John Philip Deluse , a saloon keeper in Indianapolis who claimed he encountered a stranger in his saloon the day before the bombing . The man was carrying a satchel and on his way from New York to Chicago . According to Deluse , the stranger was interested in the labor situation in Chicago , repeatedly pointed to his satchel and said , " You will hear of some trouble there very soon . " Parsons used Deluse 's testimony to suggest the bomb thrower was sent by eastern capitalists . Nothing more was ever learned about Deluse 's claim .

 Lingg , Spies , Fischer , Engel , and Parsons were buried at the German Waldheim Cemetery ( later merged with Forest Home Cemetery ) in Forest Park , Illinois , a suburb of Chicago . Schwab and Neebe were also buried at Waldheim when they died , reuniting the " Martyrs . " In 1893 , the Haymarket Martyrs ' Monument by sculptor Albert <unk> was raised at Waldheim . Over a century later , it was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior . 
 Throughout the 20th century , activists such as Emma Goldman chose to be buried near the Haymarket Martyrs ' Monument graves .

 In 1889 , a commemorative nine @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 meter ) bronze statue of a Chicago policeman by sculptor Johannes Gelert was erected in the middle of Haymarket Square with private funds raised by the Union League Club of Chicago . The statue was unveiled on May 30 , 1889 , by Frank Degan , the son of Officer Mathias Degan . On May 4 , 1927 , the 41st anniversary of the Haymarket affair , a streetcar jumped its tracks and crashed into the monument . The motorman said he was " sick of seeing that policeman with his arm raised " . The city restored the statue in 1928 and moved it to Union Park . During the 1950s , construction of the Kennedy Expressway erased about half of the old , run @-@ down market square , and in 1956 , the statue was moved to a special platform built for it overlooking the freeway , near its original location . 
 The Haymarket statue was vandalized with black paint on May 4 , 1968 , the 82nd anniversary of the Haymarket affair , following a confrontation between police and demonstrators at a protest against the Vietnam War . On October 6 , 1969 , shortly before the " Days of Rage " protests , the statue was destroyed when a bomb was placed between its legs . Weatherman took credit for the blast , which broke nearly 100 windows in the neighborhood and scattered pieces of the statue onto the Kennedy Expressway below . The statue was rebuilt and unveiled on May 4 , 1970 , to be blown up yet again by Weatherman on October 6 , 1970 . The statue was rebuilt , again , and Mayor Richard J. Daley posted a 24 ‑ hour police guard at the statue . This guard cost $ 67 @,@ 440 per year . In 1972 , it was moved to the lobby of the Central Police Headquarters , and in 1976 to the enclosed courtyard of the Chicago police academy . For another three decades the statue 's empty , graffiti @-@ marked pedestal stood on its platform in the run @-@ down remains of Haymarket Square where it was known as an anarchist landmark . On June 1 , 2007 , the statue was rededicated at Chicago Police Headquarters with a new pedestal , unveiled by Geraldine <unk> , Officer Mathias Degan 's great @-@ granddaughter . 
 In 1992 , the site of the speakers ' wagon was marked by a bronze plaque set into the sidewalk , reading : 
 " A decade of strife between labor and industry culminated here in a confrontation that resulted in the tragic death of both workers and policemen . On May 4 , 1886 , spectators at a labor rally had gathered around the mouth of Crane 's Alley . A contingent of police approaching on Des Plaines Street were met by a bomb thrown from just south of the alley . The resultant trial of eight activists gained worldwide attention for the labor movement , and initiated the tradition of ' May Day ' labor rallies in many cities . " 
 Designated on March 25 , 1992 
 Richard M. Daley , Mayor 
 On September 14 , 2004 , Daley and union leaders — including the president of Chicago 's police union — unveiled a monument by Chicago artist Mary Brogger , a fifteen @-@ foot speakers ' wagon sculpture echoing the wagon on which the labor leaders stood in Haymarket Square to champion the eight @-@ hour day . The bronze sculpture , intended to be the centerpiece of a proposed " Labor Park " , is meant to symbolize both the rally at Haymarket and free speech . The planned site was to include an international commemoration wall , sidewalk plaques , a cultural pylon , a seating area , and banners , but construction has not yet begun . 
 As of 2014 , a feature motion picture is being produced about the Haymarket affair , the events leading up to it , and its aftermath .

 M @-@ 185 is a state trunkline highway in the U.S. state of Michigan that circles Mackinac Island , a popular tourist destination on the Lake Huron side of the Straits of Mackinac , along the island 's shoreline . A narrow paved road of 8 @.@ 004 miles ( 12 @.@ 881 km ) , it offers scenic views of the straits that divide the Upper and the Lower peninsulas of Michigan and Lakes Huron and Michigan . It has no connection to any other Michigan state trunkline highways — as it is on an island — and is accessible only by passenger ferry . The City of Mackinac Island , which shares jurisdiction over the island with the Mackinac Island State Park Commission ( MISPC ) , calls the highway Main Street within the built @-@ up area on the island 's southeast quadrant , and Lake Shore Road elsewhere . M @-@ 185 passes by several important sites within Mackinac Island State Park , including Fort Mackinac , Arch Rock , British Landing , and Devil 's Kitchen . Lake Shore Road carries the highway next to the Lake Huron shoreline , running between the water 's edge and woodlands outside the downtown area . 
 According to the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , M @-@ 185 is " the only state highway in the nation where motor vehicles are banned " . Traffic on it is by foot , on horse , by horse @-@ drawn vehicle , or by bicycle . Restrictions on automobiles date back to the 1890s , and since the ban , only a few vehicles have been permitted on the island other than the city 's emergency vehicles . The highway was built during the first decade of the 20th century by the state and designated as a state highway in 1933 . The highway was paved in the 1950s , and portions were rebuilt to deal with shoreline erosion in the 1980s . Until 2005 , it was the only state highway without any automobile accidents . 
 = = Route description = = 
 As a circular highway , M @-@ 185 has no specific termini ; the generally accepted starting point is at the mile 0 marker placed in front of the Mackinac Island State Park Visitor Center . The highway uses wooden markers to measure miles instead of the common metal signage ; these signs are erected by the MISPC , as MDOT does not install the standard state highway reassurance markers along this roadway . M @-@ 185 is one of only three state trunkline highways in Michigan on islands ; the others are M @-@ 134 on Drummond Island and M @-@ 154 on Harsens Island . No part of M @-@ 185 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . Over a half million people travel along the trunkline in a year . 
 Mackinac Island has been a tourist destination since the late 19th century . The island was the country 's second national park , after Yellowstone , until the land was given to Michigan in 1895 to become its first state park . M @-@ 185 has been recognized in the press for its unique role as the only state highway without car traffic in the United States by such publications as The Kansas City Star , the Chicago Tribune , the Toronto Star , and The Saturday Evening Post . In 2003 , it was named the " best scenic drive " in the state by The Detroit News . In 2008 , USA Today named the island one of the " 10 great places to get your feet back on the ground " as a car @-@ free destination , highlighting the unique status of M @-@ 185 in the process . The magazine Paraplegia News , in an article encouraging its readers to visit Mackinac Island , called the trek around the island on M @-@ 185 a " high priority " for visitors . The trip around the island " provides a photo opportunity at every bend in the path " , according to the PSA Journal , the official magazine of the Photographic Society of America . 
 = = = Along the harbor = = = 
 The beginning and ending of M @-@ 185 is marked at the intersection of Main and Fort streets next to the visitor center . That building is operated by the MISPC , but it was originally a US Coast Guard station . From its starting point , M @-@ 185 heads east between Marquette Park , at the base of Fort Mackinac , and the marina at Haldimand Bay . The roadway passes the Indian Dormitory ( Mackinac Art Center ) , as well as various hotels , bed and breakfast establishments , private residences and landmarks such as Sainte Anne 's Catholic Church , Mission Church and the Mission House . Main Street then turns northeasterly , passing Mission Point Resort ( the former Mackinac College ) , after which the road name changes to Lake Shore Road . Along this section of the trunkline , Shoreline Trail departs to the south and follows the water 's edge before returning to M @-@ 185 at the city 's water filtration plant . 
 = = = Around the island = = = 
 After rounding Mission Point , M @-@ 185 continues north @-@ northwesterly along the eastern shore of Mackinac Island , first passing <unk> Spring then the Arch Rock viewing area just beyond the mile 1 marker . The next two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of M @-@ 185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur 's Bay . Other than a few picnic tables , the only feature between Arch Rock and mile 3 is the Lake Shore Nature Trail , a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road . Just beyond mile 3 , Scott 's Shore Road , a short gravel @-@ surfaced connecting roadway between Lake Shore Road and Scott 's Road , departs inland near Point St. Clair . M @-@ 185 is bounded by the interior woods on one side and the beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area . 
 Mile 4 is situated at Point aux Pins at the northernmost point of the island . Here , M @-@ 185 turns southerly , passing the state boat dock and a nature center before coming to British Landing at the intersection with British Landing Road . The area is a popular stopping point for tourists biking or walking M @-@ 185 ; it is the location where British troops came ashore during the Battle of Mackinac Island during the War of 1812 . Located around British Landing are various amenities including restrooms , picnic tables , and a concession stand . M @-@ 185 continues along <unk> Bay and passes the mile 5 marker near Radisson Point . 
 The next area along M @-@ 185 is also sparsely developed as it passes along Griffin Cove . Other than a few newer residential developments , the sights are limited to Brown 's Brook , which features a picnic area and interpretive nature trail , and the views of the Mackinac Bridge as the trunkline rounds both Heriot and Perrot points . Between the markers for miles 6 and 7 is the Devil 's Kitchen , another popular tourist stopping point , at <unk> Point . Near mile 7 is the West Bluff Stairs leading up the bluff to Pontiac 's Lookout . Further along , there is a marker commemorating the filming of a scene from Somewhere in Time as well as views of the Grand Hotel . The building 's 660 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 200 m ) front porch is promoted as the " longest in the world " . Visible to the east of the hotel is Michigan 's second Governor 's Mansion , which is used as a summer retreat for the state 's chief executive . At this point , M @-@ 185 transitions back to the more developed portion of the island and the road name for the trunkline changes back to Main Street . Next to the roadway , a boardwalk runs from here into the downtown business district . 
 = = = Entering downtown = = = 
 The first landmark as the highway approaches downtown Mackinac Island is the island 's public school building . As it passes the island 's public library on the shoreline side of the street , Main Street makes a sweeping curve to the north at Windermere , or Biddle 's , Point to run through the downtown district . Other than the library , most of the city 's public buildings are actually situated along Market Street , one block behind Main Street . Three streets and a city park allow for connections between Main and Market streets . M @-@ 185 through downtown Mackinac Island passes through the major business district , featuring dozens of shops , restaurants and lodging establishments ; nearly a dozen of these outlets , feature the authentic Mackinac Island fudge made fresh daily during tourist season . The passenger ferry docks are all situated along Main Street in the downtown area . At the northeastern end of the downtown district , Main Street intersects Fort Street at the state park visitor center to complete its circuit of Mackinac Island .

 The first city ordinances banning all motorized vehicles from the island were passed on July 6 , 1898 , with similar state park rules coming in 1901 . The residents complained after a doctor 's car scared their horses and caused carriage accidents , and these complaints prompted the ban . As such , other than a handful of emergency and utility vehicles as well as others by special , limited @-@ time permit , no cars or trucks are allowed on the island and no motorized vehicles appear on M @-@ 185 . Traffic on this highway is by foot , on horse , by horse @-@ drawn vehicle , or by bicycle ; M @-@ 185 is the only such state highway in the country " that allows no automobiles " . As a result , the roadside litter is picked up using a horse @-@ drawn wagon . 
 Lake Shore Road around the island was built between 1900 and 1910 by the state , and the M @-@ 185 designation was first assigned on July 12 , 1933 . The roadway was purpose @-@ built for non @-@ motorized use ; it is narrower than other state highways . During the 1950s , the state paved the road in asphalt . Since the 1970s , the MISPC has allowed snowmobiles to operate on Mackinac Island during the winter . 
 In the mid @-@ 1980s , rising water levels in Lake Huron endangered M @-@ 185 and bicyclists . The roadway was <unk> by waves from the lake during a storm on May 31 , 1985 ; the waves littered the road with gravel and dirt and raised fears of erosion . MDOT spent around $ 50 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 153 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) to install 2 @,@ 500 short tons ( 2 @,@ 200 long tons ; 2 @,@ 300 t ) of rock and filter cloth designed to prevent erosion . The expectation at the time was that Lake Huron could rise another 4 – 5 inches ( 10 – 13 cm ) that summer . Such a lake level increase prompted worries that the waves would wash away sections of the road . The lake had already washed away shoreline near Arch Rock ; there was at least 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) of berm between the road and shoreline in the 1970s and by 1985 some sections had been reduced to just 2 inches ( 5 @.@ 1 cm ) . Storms later that year washed away sections of M @-@ 185 , removing huge chunks of asphalt . MDOT closed those stretches on July 7 , 1986 , after the Independence Day weekend , to fix the damage . Repairs were budgeted to replace the missing sections of roadway at a cost of $ 894 @,@ 366 ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 62 million in 2015 ) ; tourists were detoured inland , and uphill , to access the island 's various tourist attractions . 
 In 1979 , while filming Somewhere in Time , a car was brought on the island for Christopher Reeve 's character to drive . The next time that a vehicle was permitted on the island was on July 6 , 1998 , to commemorate the original ordinance that prohibited cars from Mackinac Island . A 1901 Geneva steam @-@ powered car toured the island and was exhibited in Marquette Park before being towed by horse back to British Landing . 
 MDOT obtained a $ 242 @,@ 000 grant ( equivalent to $ 354 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) from the Federal Highway Administration in 2002 to purchase conservation easements along M @-@ 185 . The land adjacent to the highway on the east side of the island is publicly owned while along the west it is mostly private . The grant allowed the MISPC and MDOT to either purchase the development rights to adjacent properties along Lake Shore Road , or the adjacent properties themselves . 
 The only known motor vehicle collision on Mackinac Island occurred on M @-@ 185 at the head of the Shepler passenger ferry dock on May 13 , 2005 , when the island 's fire truck slightly damaged the door on the island 's ambulance ; both vehicles were responding to a report from the ferryboat that an injured passenger required medical attention . Before this incident , it was the only state highway that " never had an automobile accident " according to the Toronto Star .

 Learie Nicholas Constantine , Baron Constantine , ( 21 September 1901 – 1 July 1971 ) was a West Indian cricketer , lawyer and politician who served as Trinidad 's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and became the UK 's first black peer . He played 18 Test matches before the Second World War and took the West Indies ' first wicket in Test cricket . An advocate against racial discrimination , in later life he was influential in the passing of the 1965 Race Relations Act in Britain . He was knighted in 1962 and made a life peer in 1969 . 
 Born in Trinidad , Constantine established an early reputation as a promising cricketer , and was a member of the West Indies teams that toured England in 1923 and 1928 . Unhappy at the lack of opportunities for black people in Trinidad , he decided to pursue a career as a professional cricketer in England , and during the 1928 tour was awarded a contract with the Lancashire League club Nelson . He played for the club with distinction between 1929 and 1938 , while continuing as a member of the West Indies Test team in tours of England and Australia . Although his record as a Test cricketer was less impressive than in other cricket he helped to establish a uniquely West Indian style of play . He was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1939 . 
 During the Second World War , Constantine worked for the Ministry of Labour and National Service as a Welfare Officer responsible for West Indians employed in English factories . In 1943 , the manager of a London hotel refused to accommodate Constantine and his family on the grounds of their race ; Constantine successfully sued the hotel company . Commentators recognise the case as a milestone in British Racial Equality . Constantine qualified as a barrister in 1954 , while also establishing himself as a journalist and broadcaster . He returned to Trinidad in 1954 , entered politics and became a founding member of the People 's National Movement , subsequently entering the Trinidad government as minister of communications . From 1961 to 1964 , he served as Trinidad 's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and , controversially , became involved in issues relating to racial discrimination , including the Bristol Bus Boycott . In his final years , he served on the Race Relations Board , the Sports Council and the Board of Governors of the BBC . Failing health reduced his effectiveness in some of these roles , and he faced criticism for becoming a part of the British Establishment . He died of a heart attack on 1 July 1971 , aged 69 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Constantine was born in Petit Valley , a village close to Diego Martin in north @-@ west Trinidad , on 21 September 1901 , the second child of the family and the eldest of three brothers . His father , Lebrun Constantine , was the grandchild of slaves ; Lebrun rose to the position of overseer on a cocoa estate in Cascade , near Maraval , where the family moved in 1906 . Lebrun was famous on the island as a cricketer who represented Trinidad in first @-@ class cricket and toured England twice with a West Indian team . Constantine 's mother , <unk> Pascall , was the daughter of slaves , and her brother Victor , was also a Trinidad and West Indian first @-@ class cricketer ; a third family member , Constantine 's brother Elias , later represented Trinidad . Constantine wrote that although the family was not wealthy , his childhood was happy . He spent a lot of time playing in the hills near his home or on the estates where his father and grandfather worked . He enjoyed cricket from an early age ; the family regularly practised together under the supervision of Lebrun and Victor Pascall . 
 Constantine first went to the St Ann 's Government School in Port of Spain , then attended St Ann 's Roman Catholic School until 1917 . He displayed little enthusiasm for learning and never reached a high academic standard , but showed prowess at several sports and was respected for his cricketing lineage . He played for the school cricket team , which he captained in his last two years , by which time he was developing a reputation as an attacking batsman , a good fast @-@ medium bowler and an excellent fielder . His father prohibited him from playing competitive club cricket until 1920 for fear of premature exposure to top @-@ class opposition while too young ; in addition , he first wanted his son to establish a professional career . Upon leaving school Constantine joined Jonathan Ryan , a firm of solicitors in Port of Spain , as a clerk . This was a possible route into the legal profession ; however , as a member of the black lower @-@ middle class , he was unlikely to progress far . Few black Trinidadians at this time became solicitors , and he faced many social restrictions owing to his colour .

 = = = Cricket in Trinidad = = = 
 In 1916 , before his father imposed a ban on competitive cricket , Constantine had played briefly for Shannon Cricket Club ; he returned to the club in 1920 . Initially , he appeared in the second team , but after scoring 50 runs in an hour during his third game , was promoted to the first eleven . Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided along racial lines ; Shannon was mainly for black lower middle @-@ class players such as teachers or clerks . The club was competitive and highly motivated , partly as a reaction to the racial discrimination that its players and supporters encountered in their daily lives . Constantine 's cricket thrived in this atmosphere , and the club helped to form some of his political views . He particularly noticed that in Trinidadian and West Indian cricket , white and light @-@ skinned players were often favoured over black players of greater ability . 
 Constantine 's reputation continued to grow . An innings for Shannon in 1921 against renowned fast bowler George John received great local publicity , but according to the cricket writer and social historian C. L. R. James , this was the only time prior to 1928 that Constantine played in such an effective way . Constantine 's father , still a formidable player , did not put himself forward for selection into the Trinidad team in 1921 , in the hope that his son would replace him . The white captain of the Trinidad team , Major Bertie <unk> , recognised the younger Constantine 's promise , and selected him to play in Trinidad 's Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament match against British Guiana . Unfortunately , Constantine arrived late after a newspaper advertised the wrong starting time , and did not play . However , he made his first @-@ class debut in the following match , the final of the tournament , against Barbados on 21 September 1921 . He scored a duck in his first innings , batting at number eight in the batting order . After taking two wickets at a cost of 44 runs in Barbados ' only innings , he scored 24 in his second innings , batting at number three . 
 Constantine played for Trinidad in the next Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament , in British Guiana in 1922 . Although in two games he scored only 45 runs and took four wickets , commentators considered his fielding in the covers to be exceptional , and he retained his place in the team largely as a fielder . Although Trinidad lost to Barbados in the final , the Barbados captain Harold Austin , who was also captain of the West Indies team , was impressed by Constantine . Mainly on the strength of his fielding , Austin secured Constantine 's selection for the 1923 West Indian tour of England ; it was a surprising choice , as there were other candidates who appeared to have stronger claims . By this time Constantine was working for Llewellyn Roberts , a larger solicitors ' practice which paid better . As his new employer 's longer working hours restricted Constantine 's cricket practice , when he was selected for the West Indies tour he resigned his position . 
 = = = Tour of England in 1923 = = = 
 The 1923 West Indies touring team played 21 first @-@ class matches in England , of which six were won , seven lost and the others drawn . The team 's relative success , and particularly the performance of leading batsman George Challenor , persuaded English critics that West Indies cricket was stronger than previously supposed ; this was instrumental in the promotion of the team to Test match status in 1928 . Challenor was the biggest individual success of the tour , but Constantine impressed English critics , through his style of play more than his statistical achievements . He played 20 first @-@ class matches on the tour , scoring 425 runs at an average of 15 @.@ 74 and taking 37 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 86 . Against Oxford University , he scored 77 , his maiden first @-@ class fifty ; his only other half century came against Derbyshire . He also took five wickets in an innings for the first time , in the match against Kent . 
 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack recorded that his batting , while highly unorthodox in technique , could be very effective when he was in form . Wisden also noted that his bowling was fast . Several English players , including Jack Hobbs , singled out Constantine as an unusually talented cricketer on the strength of his performances in 1923 . Pelham Warner , a former England captain and influential journalist and administrator , described Constantine after the tour as the best fielder in the world ; his fielding was also praised by the press and in the pages of Wisden . James later wrote : " He is a success , but he has not set the Thames on fire , and , what is more , he hasn 't tried to . " 
 = = = Mid @-@ 1920s career = = = 
 John Arlott later commented that , on his first tour of England , Constantine " learnt much that he never forgot , by no means all of it about cricket : and he recognised the game as his only possible ladder to the kind of life he wanted . " When Constantine returned to Trinidad , he had no permanent job and little prospect of advancement in any suitable profession . He took several temporary jobs but was often forced to rely financially upon his family . However , his success had inspired him to pursue a career as a professional cricketer in England , and he began to practise to reach the required standard . Although he scored 167 for Shannon in 1924 , and took eight for 38 for Trinidad against Barbados , Constantine 's cricket was steady but not consistently successful . He was initially dropped from the West Indies team to face the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) touring team during 1926 , though he was recalled for the second match , once again at the insistence of Austin , who wanted a good cover fielder in the team . In the match Constantine was involved in an incident over short @-@ pitched bowling . The MCC fast bowlers had bowled short at the 49 @-@ year @-@ old Austin ; in retaliation , Constantine bounced the MCC captain , Freddie Calthorpe , and only stopped after James pointed out the diplomatic row which would follow if Calthorpe , a respected figure in the British establishment , was hit by the ball . Once more , Constantine 's performances were not statistically exceptional , but his style impressed critics and spectators , and he came top of the West Indies bowling averages . 
 A new , permanent job with Trinidad Leaseholds allowed Constantine to devote more time to cricket . Constantine realised that to succeed as a professional cricketer , he needed to improve ; his bowling lacked true speed and , when batting , he was often dismissed playing shots which were too adventurous . After his relative failure in 1926 , he increased his level of practice , improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling . In the trial matches before the 1928 tour of England , Constantine secured his place on the tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63 . He left behind his wife Norma , whom he had married in 1927 , and his newly @-@ born daughter . 
 = = = Tour of England in 1928 = = = 
 Constantine 's main objective on the 1928 tour was to secure a contract to play cricket professionally in England . James wrote that Constantine " had revolted against the revolting contrast between his first @-@ class status as a cricketer and his third @-@ class status as a man ... The restraints imposed upon him by social conditions in the West Indies had become intolerable and he decided to stand them no longer . " According to James , Constantine would never have left Trinidad had he been able to live with " honour [ and ] a little profit " . In the tour 's opening first @-@ class match , against Derbyshire , Constantine began his second innings when the West Indians needed 40 runs to win ; in seven scoring shots , Constantine hit 31 runs and took the team to a two @-@ wicket victory . In the following match he scored his maiden first @-@ class century , 130 in 90 minutes , against Essex . 
 As the tour proceeded , Constantine continued his success ; the Middlesex game at Lord 's brought his name to the widest notice in cricket circles . Although struggling for fitness , he chose to play knowing that he was a star attraction in this high profile game . Middlesex batted first , and reached 352 before declaring the innings closed — Constantine bowled little owing to his injury — and the West Indies were struggling at 79 for five when Constantine came in to bat . He scored 50 in 18 minutes and reached 86 in under an hour , to avert his side 's follow @-@ on . In Middlesex 's second innings , Constantine took seven for 57 in a spell of extremely fast bowling and the county were dismissed for 136 . The West Indies needed 259 to win ; they looked likely to lose when Constantine returned to bat with the score 121 for five . He scored 103 in 60 minutes , hitting two sixes and 12 fours and guiding the West Indies to a three @-@ wicket victory . For players and spectators this was the defining match of Constantine 's career ; many years later , cricket writer E. W. Swanton suggested that there were few all @-@ round performances in the history of cricket to match it . Shortly after the game , Nelson , a cricket club in the Lancashire League , offered Constantine a professional contract . 
 The rest of Constantine 's 1928 tour was generally successful ; only in the three Test matches , the first played by the West Indies , was he less effective . Although he took the West Indies ' first wicket in Test cricket , dismissing Charlie Hallows , and finished with innings figures of four for 82 , he took only one more wicket during the remainder of the series and ended with five wickets at an average of 52 @.@ 40 ; with the bat , he scored 89 runs in six innings at 14 @.@ 83 . Even so , Jack Hobbs said that Constantine 's opening overs to him in the first Test were among the fastest he ever faced , Constantine believed his captain , Karl Nunes , over @-@ bowled him ; the pair did not get along well . When the tour ended , Constantine had scored more runs and taken more wickets and catches in first @-@ class games than any other tourist . He was second in the team 's batting averages with 1 @,@ 381 runs at 34 @.@ 52 , and led the bowling averages with 107 wickets at 22 @.@ 95 . It was the manner in which Constantine played which set him apart from the restrained form of cricket generally played in England at the time : his style , aggression and entertainment value made a big impression on the crowds . According to Peter Mason in his biography of Constantine , he established a unique style of West Indian cricket and possibly established the template for West Indian cricketers for years to come .

 At the end of the 1928 tour Constantine returned home and helped Trinidad to win the Intercolonial Tournament . He took 16 wickets in the two games and scored 133 in the final against Barbados , the highest score of his career and a record for Trinidad at the time . These were his last matches in the tournament , as the rules did not permit professional cricketers ( which he became when he signed for Nelson ) to take part . In 1929 Constantine played one match in Jamaica for a West Indies team against an English touring team and then travelled to Nelson to begin his professional career . 
 Constantine returned to the West Indies to face England ( represented by the MCC as was usual in those days ) in a four @-@ match Test series early in 1930 . The first Test was drawn ; Constantine scored few runs , but bowled for a long time and fielded well . After the game , he was awarded a bat for his contribution . Calthorpe , the MCC captain , criticised his use of short @-@ pitched bowling to a leg side field ; one such ball struck Andy Sandham , but Constantine only reverted to more conventional tactics after a request from the MCC manager . During the second Test Constantine scored a rapid 58 and took six wickets , but the West Indies lost by 167 runs . In the following match the West Indies recorded their first win in Test matches ; after centuries from George Headley and Clifford Roach , Constantine took four for 35 and five for 87 to secure the victory . Constantine was omitted from the final match in Jamaica , because inter @-@ island politics meant that selectors tended to pick players from the island hosting the Test . In the series , 29 players represented the West Indies and the team had a different captain in each match . In the three matches in which he played , Constantine scored 144 runs at 14 @.@ 40 and took 18 wickets at 27 @.@ 61 . 
 After his second season at Nelson , Constantine joined the first West Indies team to tour Australia in the 1930 – 31 season . The side felt some trepidation over how the black members of the side would be received , but the tour passed off without incident ; Constantine later praised the reception the team was accorded . The West Indians were captained by Jackie Grant , a white man who had played for Cambridge University but was unfamiliar with his team . Constantine considered this unsatisfactory , and felt it affected the team 's performances . The West Indies were heavily defeated in the five @-@ Test series , losing the first four matches before winning the last . Constantine achieved little in the series , scoring 72 runs at 7 @.@ 20 and taking eight wickets at 50 @.@ 87 . In other first @-@ class games , he was more successful and , although Headley performed very well , it was Constantine who proved most popular with spectators . Even before the Tests began , his fielding drew praise from the press and he was described in The Sydney Mail as the fastest bowler seen in Australia for years . Monty Noble , a former Australian captain , writing in the Sydney Sun described one innings of 59 runs as " sensational " and one of the best played in Australia since the war . Constantine scored a century in 52 minutes against Tasmania , played five other innings over fifty and took three five @-@ wicket returns . In 1950 Donald Bradman , who played against Constantine that season , described him as the greatest fielder he had seen . In all first @-@ class matches , Constantine scored 708 runs at an average of 30 @.@ 78 and took 47 wickets at 20 @.@ 21 ; he led the team 's bowling averages and came fourth in batting . 
 = = = Test series against England in 1933 and 1934 – 35 = = = 
 By now living in Nelson and barred from the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament , Constantine played no first @-@ class cricket for two years . His contract with Nelson made him unavailable for much of the 1933 West Indies ' tour of England under Grant . Constantine never challenged Nelson over this ; some critics suggested he was swayed by the greater financial rewards the club provided . He appeared once for the tourists in May , scoring 57 in 27 minutes and taking four wickets in a victory over an MCC team at Lord 's . The West Indian board unsuccessfully tried to secure his release for the first Test match , which the West Indies lost heavily . After he took nine wickets in the tourists ' game against Yorkshire , Nelson gave him permission to appear in the second Test at Manchester . 
 During the previous winter , England had played Australia in the controversial Bodyline series in which the English bowlers were accused of bowling the ball on the line of leg stump . The deliveries were often short @-@ pitched with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections off the bat . The tactics were difficult for batsmen to counter and were designed to be intimidatory . In the 1933 English season , Bodyline was a sensitive subject . There had already been controversy in the tourists ' match against the MCC , during which Constantine and Manny Martindale , another West Indian fast bowler , were criticised in the press for bowling short . Frustrated by a slow pitch which he believed was intended to neutralise his fast bowlers , Grant had ordered Constantine to bowl Bodyline against Yorkshire , and decided to repeat the tactics in the second Test . The West Indies scored 375 , of which Constantine made 31 . When England replied , several batsmen were discomfited by the Bodyline bowling ; Wally Hammond was struck on the chin and retired hurt . Constantine and Martindale bowled up to four short deliveries each over so that the ball rose to head height ; occasionally they bowled around the wicket . 
 Although not as fast as he had been on the previous tour , Constantine was still capable of short bursts of very fast bowling . However , the slowness of the pitch reduced the effectiveness of the Bodyline tactics , and Constantine took one for 55 ; England 's captain Douglas Jardine , who had implemented the Bodyline tactics in Australia , batted for five hours to score his only Test century . The public disapproval expressed during and after the match was instrumental in turning English attitudes against Bodyline , something Constantine considered hypocritical . In the West Indies ' second innings Constantine 's innings of 64 in an hour ensured that the match was drawn . Nelson initially agreed to release him for the third Test , with Essex all @-@ rounder Stan Nichols to be Constantine 's substitute for the club team . When Jardine heard , he convinced the England selectors to include Nichols in the England team for the Test , the deal collapsed and Constantine did not play . Most critics believed that the West Indies underachieved in the Test series ; Constantine believed that one cause was the inadequacy of Grant as captain . In all first @-@ class games on the tour Constantine scored 181 runs at 20 @.@ 11 and took 14 wickets at 22 @.@ 14 . 
 Constantine worked in India as a cricket coach during 1934 , playing two matches in the <unk> @-@ ud @-@ <unk> Gold Cup Tournament . He was invited to play in the 1935 Test series against England in the West Indies , and although he arrived too late for the first Test , won by England , he played in the remaining three games of the series . In a match for Trinidad before the second Test , he and his brother Elias appeared together for the only time in a first @-@ class match , and shared a partnership of 93 . In the next Test Constantine scored 90 , his highest Test score . England needed 325 to win in the fourth innings , but lost early wickets . In the final stages of the match Constantine was warned by the umpire for bowling Bodyline , and Grant withdrew him from the bowling attack . After the crowd protested , Constantine returned to bowl ; with two balls of the match left , took the final English wicket . The West Indies won by 217 runs , with Constantine taking three for 11 ; in the match as a whole he scored 121 runs and took five wickets . The third Test was drawn , leaving the final Test to decide the series . After making a large total , the West Indies bowled England out twice to win by an innings and record their first Test series victory . As well as taking six wickets in the game , Constantine captained the team to victory after Grant injured an ankle on the last morning and asked Constantine to assume the leadership . Peter Mason writes : " Given the measures that the West Indian authorities had taken to ensure that no black man would ever captain a regional side , it was a great irony and a huge source of delight to Constantine that he should be the man to lead the team at the moment of their greatest achievement so far . " Once more , the press praised Constantine and hailed his achievements . In the series , he scored 169 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 80 and took 15 wickets at 13 @.@ 13 . 
 = = = Tour of England in 1939 = = = 
 Apart from one guest appearance for Barbados in a friendly match early in 1939 , Constantine did not play first @-@ class cricket after 1935 until the West Indies toured England in 1939 . Constantine had deliberately not signed a league contract in 1939 , to be available for the tour . However , he was unhappy with the playing strength of the touring team and the £ 600 he was offered in wages . He believed that the captain , Rolph Grant ( younger brother of Jackie ) , was unqualified for the job and had been appointed only because he was white . Constantine captained the side in one match , but was reprimanded by the West Indies board for not pursuing a win . The West Indies lost the three @-@ match Test series 1 – 0 against a very strong England side , although critics judged the overall playing record of the team to be good . In the three Tests , Constantine scored 110 runs at 27 @.@ 50 and took 11 wickets at 29 @.@ 81 , including five for 75 in the final Test . 
 By this time Constantine bowled generally at medium pace from a short run @-@ up . To compensate for his reduced pace he mixed up his bowling style , spinning the ball and bowling at speeds varying from slow to very fast . He bowled more overs than any other member of the team , and was the side 's leading wicket @-@ taker with 103 wickets in the season . His bowling average of 17 @.@ 77 placed him first in the team 's bowling averages and seventh in the English national averages . With the bat , Constantine scored 614 runs at 21 @.@ 17 ; Preston wrote that Constantine " often electrified onlookers with his almost impudent zest for runs " . His highest innings came in the final Test match when he scored 79 in an hour and hit 11 fours . Wisden commented : " Constantine , in the mood suggesting his work in Saturday afternoon League cricket , brought a welcome air of gaiety to the Test arena . He revolutionised all the recognised features of cricket and , surpass [ ed ] Bradman in his amazing stroke play . " For his all @-@ round performances during the season he was chosen as one of Wisden 's Cricketers of the Year . 
 The third Test match , after which the tour was abandoned owing to the imminent outbreak of the Second World War , was Constantine 's last . In 18 Test matches between 1928 and 1939 he scored 635 runs at an average of 19 @.@ 24 , took 58 wickets at 30 @.@ 10 and held 28 catches . He played one more first @-@ class match when , in 1945 , he captained a team representing the " Dominions " against England at Lord 's . The match was narrowly won by the Dominions . Constantine , in the second innings , shared a partnership of 117 in 45 minutes with Keith Miller . He bowled very little , but ran out a batsman at a key point in the final innings . In all first @-@ class cricket , Constantine scored 4 @,@ 475 runs at 24 @.@ 05 and took 439 wickets at 20 @.@ 48 . 
 = = = Lancashire League cricketer = = = 
 In 1928 Constantine had signed an initial three @-@ year contract with Nelson , to play in the Lancashire League . The contract was worth £ 500 per season , plus performance bonuses and travelling expenses . He remained there until 1937 , an unusually long time for a professional to remain with one club . Constantine 's appearances boosted attendances and gate receipts for all Nelson 's matches , and was of great financial benefit to both the club and the League as a whole . In Constantine 's nine seasons at the club , Nelson never finished lower than second , won the league competition seven times and the knockout cup twice . In 1931 Constantine renewed his contract for £ 650 per season ; when in 1935 a rival league attempted to sign him , all the Lancashire League clubs contributed to his wage , which rose to £ 750 per year between 1935 and 1937 . This was far more than the then maximum wage for a professional footballer of £ 386 , or the £ 500 per season that a top county cricketer could potentially earn , and possibly made Constantine the best @-@ paid sportsman in the country . Consequently , he and his family enjoyed a good standard of living for the first time in their lives . 
 As Nelson 's professional , Constantine was immediately successful . Although he produced better figures in subsequent years , he considered his first season at Nelson the most enjoyable of his life , owing to the freedom and excitement of the cricket . In nine years at the club he scored 6 @,@ 363 runs at an average of 37 @.@ 65 and took 776 wickets at 9 @.@ 50 . His highest score was 192 , and his best bowling figures were ten wickets for ten runs . In each season except for 1932 , he averaged over 30 with the bat and in 1933 he scored 1 @,@ 000 runs at an average of over 50 . He took over 70 wickets every season and his bowling average never rose above 11 @.@ 30 ; in five seasons , he averaged under ten runs per wicket . In 1933 he took 96 wickets , his highest seasonal aggregate , and had he not missed two games to play for the West Indies touring team , would likely have completed the cricketer 's double ( 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets ) , an unprecedented feat in the league . 
 In the mid @-@ 1930s , representatives from Lancashire County Cricket Club twice approached Constantine with a view to him joining the club — his time in Nelson meant that he qualified to play for Lancashire , having lived in the county for the required time . There was a precedent for such a course , as the Australian Ted McDonald had joined Lancashire after playing as Nelson 's professional in the 1920s . In the case of Constantine nothing happened , as members of the Lancashire Board and , later , players in the team opposed the idea of a black man playing for the county . In any case Constantine preferred league cricket to what he perceived was the negativity and dullness of county cricket . He found the standard of play very high , stating : " Never in my life have I played harder than in Lancashire . " In his history of West Indies cricket , Michael Manley writes that league cricket at this time was intense and unrelenting , but : " it was in this special atmosphere of League cricket that Constantine was supreme . " 
 For the 1938 season , Constantine played for Rochdale in the Central Lancashire Cricket League , although he continued to live in Nelson . He received £ 812 for the season , and performed successfully , but did not enjoy the experience . The nature of the pitches was different in his new league ; furthermore , some of the players seemed resentful of his high earnings . There was also an incident of racial abuse which Constantine believed the Central Lancashire League committee effectively covered up . This season ended Constantine 's career in the Lancashire Leagues , although during the war he returned to play for Nelson as an amateur . 
 = = = Style and technique = = = 
 Swanton believed that Constantine was the first West Indian cricketer to make an impression on the British public : " he ... personified West Indian cricket from the first faltering entry in the Test arena in 1928 until the post @-@ war emergence of the trinity of Worrell , Weekes and Walcott . " Swanton continued : " There have been many all @-@ rounders with better records ... but it is hard to think of one who made a more sensational impact [ and ] impossible to imagine his superior as a fielder anywhere . " In 1934 Neville Cardus described Constantine as a " genius " and the " most original cricketer of recent years " . R. C. Robertson @-@ Glasgow called Constantine the most exciting cricketer to watch of all his contemporaries . This was partly because his style of cricket meant that he could alter the course of a match in a short space of time , although he developed his technique to minimise risk . 
 Constantine 's batting was based on good eyesight , quick reflexes and natural ability . He used his wrists to adjust the angle of the bat at the last second , allowing him to counter unexpected late movement of the ball . He batted by instinct and , according to Manley , " his every stroke [ owed ] more to energy than calculation " . He was capable of scoring rapidly against any standard of bowling , but rarely survived for long periods because he chose not to defend . His best shots were the cut , pull and hook . Critics believed that Constantine 's batting reached its peak once he became an accomplished league cricketer . By setting himself to master the variety of pitch conditions he encountered , and adopting a style of fast @-@ scoring and occasionally unorthodox batting , he became an adaptable and effective batsman in all forms of cricket , improvising where necessary to prevent bowlers getting on top . 
 As a cover @-@ point fielder Constantine was , according to Manley , " athletic , panther @-@ quick , sure handed and with an arm that could rifle the ball into the wicket @-@ keeper 's gloves like a bullet even from the deepest boundary " . Many critics considered him to be one of the best fielders of all time . As a bowler , Constantine accelerated from a relatively short run into what Manley calls an " explosive " delivery . James believes he reached his best form as a bowler in 1939 , using what he had learned in the leagues . By this time his varieties of spin , pace and flight made him effective even when conditions favoured the batsmen . Although Constantine 's Test bowling record was modest , this may to some extent reflect the poor standard of fielding in the early West Indies teams , in particular their propensity to drop catches . 
 Manley writes that wherever Constantine played he brought " style and humour : that aggressiveness that is somehow good @-@ natured and which is the distinctively West Indian quality in all sport . Constantine 's extrovert exuberance was , of course , more particularly Trinidadian than generally West Indian . Perhaps it is this last characteristic that gave him that special quality of panache which sets him apart from all other West Indian cricketers . "

 = = = Nelson = = = 
 During his time in Nelson , Constantine made a deep impression and remained a celebrity there even after leaving the town ; his general community involvement was such that a regional historian described him as a " local champion " . He appreciated the greater freedom he enjoyed in Nelson as compared with Trinidad , where racial issues predominated . Although Nelson suffered from the effects of the Depression , Constantine 's high earnings were never a source of resentment ; of his time in Nelson he wrote : " If I had not come ... I could not have been the person I am today ... I am a better citizen for the time I have spent in Nelson . " 
 Constantine 's first season was difficult ; both he and the residents of the town were at that stage uncertain of each other . Few black people had been seen in Nelson , and although some residents wrote welcoming letters , the <unk> also received racist and abusive ones . He quickly established boundaries over what he considered acceptable , permitting and even sharing small jokes over skin colour but protesting strongly at outright racism . John Arlott wrote : " [ Constantine ] fought discrimination against his people with a dignity firm but free of acrimony . " Although Constantine later attributed some of the initial uneasiness to ignorance , at the time he seriously considered returning to Trinidad after the first season . His wife persuaded him otherwise , pointing out the benefits from remaining to complete his contract . From 1930 Constantine found life more comfortable ; the family began to develop friendships and to engage in the social life of the town . They continued to visit Trinidad in the English winters , but Nelson became the family 's permanent home . 
 In 1931 the <unk> settled in a fairly prosperous , middle @-@ class area of Nelson , where they were to live until 1949 . During 1932 , they took C. L. R. James — who knew Constantine through having played cricket against him in Trinidad — as a lodger ; James had come to London but had run out of money . James was at the forefront of a growing West Indian nationalist movement , though Constantine had until then consciously avoided politics . Through James ' influence , Constantine realised that his position gave him opportunities to further the cause of racial equality and Trinidadian independence . He joined the League of Coloured Peoples , an organisation aiming to achieve racial equality for black people in Britain . He helped James to get a job with the Manchester Guardian , and in return , James helped Constantine to write his first book , Cricket and I , which was published in 1933 . Later commentators have identified Constantine 's book as an important step in West Indian nationalism , and an encouragement to future authors . At that time , James wrote , few active cricketers wrote books and " no one in the West Indies that I knew , cricketer or not , was writing books at all ; certainly none was being printed abroad . " Constantine and James drifted apart once the latter returned to London ; they remained in contact but did not always agree politically or morally . Mason believes , however that without Constantine 's assistance James may not have later established himself as a celebrated political writer . 
 = = = Career during the war = = = 
 During the war , Constantine continued his cricket career as a league professional ; also , as a popular player who could boost crowd attendances , he appeared in many wartime charity games . However , the war ended his career in top @-@ class cricket and signalled a change in his life 's priorities . Remaining in Nelson when the war started , he initially served as an Air Raid Precautions equipment officer , and as a billeting officer for incoming evacuees . After applying for a job with the Ministry of Labour , Constantine was offered a senior position as Welfare Officer by the Ministry of Labour and National Service . 
 Using his familiarity with life in England , and his high profile and status as a cricketer , Constantine became responsible for the many West Indians who had been recruited to work in factories in the north @-@ west of England for the duration of the war . Working mainly from Liverpool , he helped these men to adapt to their unfamiliar environment and to deal with the severe racism and discrimination which many of them faced . Constantine also worked closely with trade unions in an attempt to ease the fears and suspicions of white workers . He used his influence with the Ministry of Labour to pressurise companies who refused to employ West Indians , but generally preferred negotiation to confrontation , an approach that was often successful . Constantine 's wartime experiences caused him to increase his involvement in the League of Coloured Peoples , sometimes referring cases to them . He particularly took up the cause of the children of white women and black overseas servicemen ; these children were often abandoned by their parents . However , plans to create a children 's home for them came to nothing , leaving Constantine frustrated . He remained in his post until the summer of 1946 , latterly concerned with the repatriation of the West Indian workers at the end of the war . For his wartime work he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) in 1947 . 
 During the war , at the request of the British government , Constantine made radio broadcasts to the West Indies , reporting on the involvement of West Indians in the war effort . As a result , he was often asked to speak on BBC radio about his life in England . His radio performances met with critical acclaim , and he became a frequent guest on radio panel shows ; he also took part in a film documentary , West Indies calling , in 1943 . 
 = = = Constantine v Imperial London Hotels = = = 
 In August 1943 Constantine played in a charity cricket match at Lord 's and had booked rooms for himself , his wife and daughter at the Imperial Hotel , London for four nights . He had been specifically told that his colour would not be an issue at the hotel . When he arrived on 30 July , he was told that they could only stay for one night because their presence might offend other guests . When Arnold Watson , a colleague of Constantine at the Ministry of Labour , arrived and attempted to intervene , he was told by the manager : " We are not going to have these niggers in our hotel , " and that his presence might offend American guests . Watson argued , to no avail , that not only was Constantine a British subject , he worked for the government . Eventually Watson persuaded Constantine to leave and stay at another hotel which , owned by the same company as the Imperial , proved to be welcoming . The Imperial Hotel incident affected Constantine deeply , both because of the involvement of his family and also because he was due to play cricket for a team representing the British Empire and Commonwealth . 
 In September questions were asked in the House of Commons about the incident , by which time Constantine had decided to take legal action . In June 1944 Constantine v Imperial London Hotels was heard in the High Court . Although there was no law against racial discrimination in Britain at the time , Constantine argued that the hotel had breached its contract with him . Constantine informed the court that the attitude of the hotel changed between his booking and arrival , owing to the presence of white American servicemen . The defence argued that they had met their contract by accommodating Constantine in another hotel and that he had left the Imperial voluntarily . The managing director of the hotel denied that racist language had been used . After two days of evidence , the judge found in Constantine 's favour , rejecting the defence 's arguments and praising the way Constantine had handled the situation . Although the law limited the award of damages against the hotel to five guineas , Constantine was vindicated . He did not pursue the case any further as he believed he had sufficiently raised the issue of racism in the public eye ; the case was widely reported in the press , and Constantine received great support from both the public and the government . 
 Although racial discrimination continued in England , this case was the first to challenge such practices in court . Critics regard it as a milestone in British racial equality in demonstrating that black people had legal recourse against some forms of racism . According to Mason , it " was one of the key milestones along the road to the creation of the Race Relations Act of 1965 . " 
 = = = Legal studies = = = 
 While living and playing cricket in Nelson before the war , Constantine had made plans for a future legal career . James helped him with his studies for a short time , and he later worked in a local solicitors ' office . In 1944 he enrolled as a student in the Middle Temple , London . To finance his studies , he continued his professional cricket career in Bradford until 1948 , and supplemented his income by coaching : at Trinity College , Dublin , in 1946 and in Ceylon in 1953 . Constantine also extended his work in journalism and broadcasting , as a cricket reporter and as a radio commentator when the West Indies toured England in 1950 . He also wrote several cricket books , probably with the help of a ghostwriter . Cricket in the Sun ( 1947 ) covered his career but also discussed the racism he had encountered and suggested then @-@ radical ideas for the future of cricket , such as a one @-@ day " world cup " . Cricketers ' Carnival ( 1948 ) , Cricket Crackers , Cricketers ' Cricket ( both 1949 ) and How To Play Cricket ( 1951 ) were more traditional cricket books , which included coaching tips and opinions . 
 In 1947 Constantine became chairman of the League of Coloured Peoples , a position he held until the League was discontinued in 1951 . In 1948 he was elected president of the Caribbean Congress of Labour , and between 1947 and 1950 was a member of the Colonial Office 's Colonial Social Welfare Advisory Committee . Also in 1950 , he became involved in a controversy over the interracial marriage of <unk> Khama , the future president of Botswana . Constantine lobbied the government on Khama 's behalf , organised meetings and even approached the United Nations . Little was achieved , and Constantine disapproved of the approach of the Labour government and its Prime Minister , Clement Attlee , but declined an opportunity to become a Liberal parliamentary candidate . 
 Constantine neither enjoyed his legal studies , nor found the work easy , but was determined to prove he could succeed . His wife kept him motivated , restricted visitors to avoid distractions and forced him to study , making him continue when he was several times tempted to give up . The family moved to London in 1949 ; between 1950 and 1954 , Constantine passed the required series of examinations , and in 1954 he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple . 
 Having turned down an offer in 1947 to return to his old employer , Trinidad Leaseholds , in 1954 Constantine agreed to join the same company as an assistant legal advisor . Uncertain about going back to Trinidad after living for 25 years in England , he nevertheless believed it was a good time to return , particularly as his daughter was moving there to marry . Before leaving England , he published his book Colour Bar ( 1954 ) , which addressed race relations in Britain and the racism he had experienced . It also discussed world @-@ wide racial oppression and how the lives of black people could be improved . At the time , according to Peter Mason , this was " an explosive , challenging , hard hitting tome , the more so because it came not from a known black militant but from someone who seemed so charming , so unruffled , so suited to British society " . Although not viewed as radical by black audiences , it was aimed at white British readers . The British press gave it mixed reviews and criticised him for unfairness in parts of the book ; other critics accused him of communist sympathies . 
 = = Return to Trinidad = = 
 When Constantine returned to Trinidad in late 1954 , he found a growing desire for independence from Britain . At Trinidad Leaseholds he felt isolated from other , mainly white , senior staff ; this drew him towards political involvement . Eric Williams , leader of the newly founded People 's National Movement ( PNM ) , was aware of Constantine 's popular appeal and recruited him . By January 1956 Constantine , with the full co @-@ operation and blessing of his employers , was party chairman and a member of its executive committee . Feeling that the PNM 's policies were in harmony with his views on improving the lives of black people , and encouraged by his wife , Constantine stood for election in the parliamentary constituency of <unk> in 1956 . He won a narrow victory , which his colleagues believed few in the party could have done , and resigned from Trinidad Leaseholds . The PNM formed a government , in which Constantine became the Minister of Communications , Works and Utilities . 
 In his ministerial role , Constantine promoted development of Trinidad 's road , rail , water and electricity infrastructure . However , in late 1958 he was accused of corruption , over a ship leasing deal . His angry response to the charge , in the Legislative Council , created a perception of arrogance among his colleagues , and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics . According to Mason , the speech was a miscalculation which made the public , perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away , question his fitness for a ministerial role , a view increasingly held by commentators . 
 In the later 1950s , Constantine supported the campaign , led by James , to appoint West Indies cricket 's first black captain ; the success of black people like Constantine in attaining government positions while not permitted to captain the cricket team was a key factor in an ultimately successful campaign . While in government , Constantine assisted in the development of the West Indies Federation , as a step towards the independence of the islands , and his fame and familiarity with Britain played some part in the negotiations which led to Trinidad 's independence in 1962 . After he decided not to stand for re @-@ election in 1961 , Williams appointed him as Trinidad and Tobago 's first High Commissioner in London . 
 Peter Mason writes that Constantine 's political career in Trinidad was a success : he was efficient , active , respected and popular . Mason concedes that he was not a natural politician , often sensitive to criticism and that his experience abroad was a cause for mistrust in Trinidad , rather than seen as an advantage . Gerald Howat believes that Constantine 's political career , while not without successes , was undermined by several factors : his age , his over @-@ frequent references to his English experience , his rejection of political theorising and lack of debating skills . However , his personal popularity undoubtedly attracted support to the PNM .

 = = = High Commissioner = = = 
 Constantine began his role as High Commissioner in June 1961 . In the New Year 's Honours list for 1962 , he was knighted and became Sir Learie Constantine ; among other accolades he received at this time was the freedom of the town of Nelson . Mason notes that Constantine had now " passed firmly into the consciousness as a British treasure " . However , his tenure as High Commissioner ended in controversy . Constantine felt that his high profile required him to speak out on racial issues affecting all West Indian immigrants , not just Trinidadians . In April 1963 , when a Bristol bus company was refusing to employ black staff , Constantine visited the city and spoke to the press about the issue . His intervention assisted in a speedy resolution of the affair which , according to Mason , was crucial in persuading the British government of the need for a Race Relations Act . However , politicians in both Trinidad and Britain felt a senior diplomat should not be so closely involved in British domestic affairs , particularly as he acted without consulting his government . Williams effectively withdrew his support from Constantine , who decided not to continue as High Commissioner when his term expired in February 1964 . 
 Although as High Commissioner Constantine looked after his staff and was respected by other diplomats , Howat observes there is limited evidence that he was successful in the post : " In the one area in which he acted positively , he blundered — the Bristol affair . In the language of the game he loved ... his timing was wrong though he was full of good intentions " . Howat adds that he did not increase his stature or reputation during his term of office . Mason believes that " there was too much of the welfare officer about him and not enough of the government focused diplomat . "

 For the remainder of his life , Constantine lived in London . He returned to legal practice and was elected an Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple in 1963 , despite his limited experience . He also resumed work in journalism : he wrote and broadcast on cricket , race and the Commonwealth , and produced two more books : a coaching book The Young Cricketers Companion ( 1964 ) , and The Changing Face of Cricket ( 1966 ) which included his thoughts on modern cricket . He made his debut as a television cricket commentator , although his failing health and talkative style meant he was less successful than on the radio . 
 In 1965 Constantine became a founding member of the Sports Council , which aimed to develop sport in Britain . Two years later , he was appointed to the three @-@ person Race Relations Board , formed through the Race Relations Act , to investigate cases of racial discrimination . In this role he spoke out against the Commonwealth Immigrants Act , a stance that led to an offer from the Liberal Party , which he declined , to stand as parliamentary candidate for Nelson . Later , he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate the release , after a military coup , of Abubakar <unk> Balewa , the overthrown Prime Minister of Nigeria . Constantine was appointed to the BBC 's General Advisory Committee in 1966 and became a BBC Governor two years later , although declining health restricted his involvement . The following year the students of St Andrews University elected Constantine as Rector , but again his health prevented him performing effectively in this role . In his last years , Constantine was criticised for becoming part of the Establishment ; Private Eye mocked him , while the new generation of West Indian immigrants believed he was out of touch . More radical black spokesmen disapproved of his conciliatory approach to racist incidents . 
 Constantine was awarded a life peerage in 1969 , becoming the first black man to sit in the House of Lords ; there were rumours that Trinidad had prevented earlier attempts to ennoble him . He took the title of Baron Constantine of Maraval in Trinidad and Nelson in the County Palatine of Lancaster . His investiture attracted widespread media attention ; Constantine stated : " I think it must have been for what I have endeavoured to do to make it possible for people of different colour to know each other better and live well together . " He sat as a crossbencher in the House , but was well enough to make only one speech in his time there . 
 Although Constantine was reluctant to leave England , his poor health necessitated a return to Trinidad , but before he could do so he died of a heart attack , probably brought about by bronchitis , on 1 July 1971 . His body was flown to Trinidad , where he received a state funeral before being buried in <unk> . He was posthumously awarded Trinidad 's highest honour , the Trinity Cross . Later in the month , a memorial service was held in London in Westminster Abbey .

 Constantine met his future wife , Norma Agatha Cox , in 1921 . She had little interest in cricket and , although their relationship developed during the early 1920s , she resented that he gave more time to cricket than he did to her . However , the relationship lasted and she began to take more of an interest in his sporting achievements . They were married on 25 July 1927 ; their only child , Gloria , was born in April 1928 . Throughout their marriage , his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close . Norma died two months after her husband in 1971 . 
 = = Personality = = 
 John Arlott describes Constantine as a man of " easy humour and essential patience ... His outlook was that of a compassionate radical and he maintained his high moral standards unswervingly . " E. W. Swanton writes : " None could call Lord Constantine a modest man , but gifts of warmth and friendliness as well as a shrewd brain and a ready tongue helped to make him one of the personalities of his time . " He did not get along with everyone ; he and England cricketer Wally Hammond feuded for nearly ten years over what Constantine perceived as a slight in 1925 – 26 . Subsequently , Constantine continually bowled short when he encountered Hammond on the field , until the pair made peace in the Old Trafford Test match of 1933 . After this , they pursued a more good @-@ natured rivalry and became quite friendly ; Hammond publicly expressed sympathy towards Constantine and other black West Indians for the discrimination that they faced . 
 In his earlier years , acquaintances believed Constantine was too conscious of colour . James wrote : " Many doors in England were open to him . That doors were closed to other West Indians seemed more important to him . " Michael Manley describes him as an extrovert who displayed great self @-@ belief in everything he did . He also notes that " Constantine was too long in England and perhaps too slight in Test @-@ match performance to make the impact on the Caribbean that he did on England . But he enchanted England . " Howat writes : " Cricket apart ... Constantine 's reputation must rest on his contribution to racial tolerance , his benevolent view of empire and Commonwealth , and his personal acceptance within the British ' establishment ' . In the end he was more English than Trinidadian and he needed that wider platform . "

 This is an Indonesian name which does not have a family name . The subject should be referred to as Ucu 
 Ucu Agustin ( born 19 August 1976 in Sukabumi , Indonesia ) is an Indonesian journalist , writer , and documentary filmmaker . 
 Educated in an Islamic boarding school , Ucu became interested in journalism after realising that there were many prostitutes from her hometown . Beginning in the print media , she moved to making documentaries after she saw a lack of opportunities for human interest pieces in newspapers . One of her first documentaries , Death in Jakarta , was produced with the help of funds from the Jakarta International Film Festival . Other documentaries include Ragat 'e Anak and Konspirasi Hening . She has also written several children 's books and short stories . 
 Ucu has been described as " one of Indonesia 's top documentary filmmakers " and often deals with social issues in her work . Ragat 'e Anak was screened at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2009 . 
 = = Early life , education and early career = = 
 Ucu was born in Sukabumi , West Java , on 19 August 1976 to a strict Muslim family . As a child , she studied in the <unk> Islamic boarding school in Jakarta for six years ; removed from the outside world , she felt shocked when she learned that many of the women in her hometown worked as prostitutes . This discovery led her to become more critical of the world around her and made her interested in journalism . Ucu later attended the Jakarta Islamic State University . 
 After graduation , Ucu began working with print media , contributing to <unk> magazine after publishing several short stories and articles elsewhere . Dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for writing pieces dealing with social issues she later switched to audio @-@ visual media ; she has also cited the intense amount of editing that her works went through as a reason for the change , noting that there " always seemed to be a wide space between the reality that happened and the ' reality ' that was reported " . 
 Ucu also became active in writing . She published five Islamic @-@ themed children 's books in 2003 , insisting on receiving royalties rather than the standard flat rate . She has also written a short story , entitled " Lelaki yang <unk> di <unk> " ( " The Man That <unk> Inside My Body " ) , for inclusion in the lesbian @-@ themed short story collection Un Soir du Paris ( An Evening in Paris ) . The book also included stories by Clara Ng , Seno Gumira Ajidarma , and Agus Noor . 
 = = Filmmaking = = 
 Ucu 's first documentary was Pramoedya : Last Chapter . In 2005 , Ucu made the 28 @-@ minute documentary Death in Jakarta . This film , dealing with the experiences of poor people after a loved one dies in Jakarta , was inspired by her observations when passing Utan <unk> Public Cemetery in Utan <unk> , East Jakarta . It was produced after becoming one of four finalists in the Jakarta International Film Festival Script Development Competition . Ucu received Rp . 25 million ( US $ 3 @,@ 000 ) in prize money and was lent a camera by the competition ; it was her first time using a professional @-@ grade camera . In April of that year she released <unk> <unk> ( If <unk> ? ) , a short story collection . 
 Her next film , Ragat 'e Anak ( For The Sake of Children ) , dealt with the lives of two part @-@ time prostitutes in a cemetery in <unk> , East Java . The documentary was included in <unk> ( At Stake ) , a compilation of works produced by the Kalyana Shira Foundation . In August 2006 , Ucu released a short story compilation , Dunia di <unk> Alice ( The World in Alice 's Head ) , and a novel , Being Ing . On 4 June 2009 , the <unk> government shut down the prostitution district as a result of the documentary ; in response , Ucu said that she regretted the decision . 
 Her next documentary , Konspirasi Hening ( Conspiracy of Silence ) was produced by Nia Dinata . It drew its title from a statement by <unk> Mohamad , former head of the Indonesian Doctors Association , that a " conspiracy of silence " had led to rules about healthcare being essentially unenforceable . The feature @-@ length film , Ucu 's first , explored healthcare issues in Indonesia by following the lives of three people , two who had suffered from malpractice and a poor man without access to healthcare . 
 In 2011 Ucu collaborated with Dinata again on Batik : Our Love Story , a documentary on the traditional textile batik . Dinata directed , while Ucu served as screenwriter . As of September 2011 , Ucu is working on three documentaries : Knocking The Door , about the Indonesian Bill for Public Information ; Thank You for Loving Me , about deforestation in Indonesia ; and Where Did You Go My Love , about kidnap victims . 
 Through the Cipta Media Bersama program , run by the Ford Foundation in collaboration with several other groups , in November 2011 Ucu received a <unk> million ( US $ 100 @,@ 000 ) grant to produce a new film . The film , entitled <unk> <unk> [ dan <unk> <unk> ] dengan Berita ( Not Starting [ and Not Ending ] With News ) will compare the habits of the press during the death of former president Soeharto and the media in 2012 ; it is hoped to shed light on issues faced by the press in both periods and promote media literacy .

 Ucu 's Islamic children 's books take a moderate stance . 
 Ika Krismantari , writing for The Jakarta Post , notes that Ucu tends to deal with " challenging " themes such as social injustice , healthcare , and gender inequality in her documentaries ; gender issues are present in most of her works . Ucu considers social justice and human rights other key themes of her works . 
 Ucu has noted that she hopes that viewers are influenced by the hard lives faced by the subjects , whom she calls " inspiring " . In September 2011 , she stated that she was most pleased with Death in Jakarta , Ragat 'e Anak , and Konspirasi Hening . Many of her documentaries are distributed online .

 = Hurricane Howard ( 2004 ) = 
 Hurricane Howard was a powerful Category 4 hurricane which produced large swells along the coasts of the Baja California Peninsula and southern California . The eighth named storm of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season , Howard originated out of a tropical wave off the coast of Mexico on August 30 . Traveling towards the northwest , the storm gradually strengthened , becoming a hurricane on September 1 and reaching its peak intensity the following day with winds of 140 mph ( 220 km / h ) . Decreasing sea surface temperatures then caused the storm to weaken . By September 4 , Howard was downgraded to a tropical storm . The next day , it degenerated into a non @-@ convective remnant low pressure area which persisted for another five days before dissipating over open waters . 
 Although the storm never made landfall , the fringe effects of the storm produced significant flooding across the Baja California Peninsula which damaged agricultural land and dozens of homes . Howard also produced large swells which reached 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 4 m ) along the Baja coastline and 10 ft ( 3 m ) along the California coastline . About 1 @,@ 000 lifeguard rescues took place in California due to the waves . Moisture from the storm also enhanced rainfall in parts of Arizona , leading to minor accumulations . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Howard began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on August 18 . The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little associated convection . By August 26 , the wave produced disorganized convection as it moved through the western Caribbean , across Central America , and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean . Paralleling the southern coast of Mexico , the wave became increasingly organized and it was estimated that the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression around 1200 UTC on August 30 about 400 mi ( 645 km ) south @-@ southwest of Acapulco , Mexico . Classified as Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E , the system tracked west @-@ northwestward under the steering currents of a weak mid @-@ level ridge . In the hours after formation , the depression lacked a concentration of deep convection near the center . However , conditions favored eventual development , including warm sea surface temperatures and low amounts of wind shear . 
 Based on increased organization and the formation of banding features , it was estimated that the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Howard at 0000 UTC on August 31 . A mid @-@ level anticyclone located over southern California was steering the storm towards the northwest . Early on September 1 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) stated that Howard had an 80 percent chance of undergoing rapid intensification based on further development of the storm and a highly favorable environment around the cyclone . Based on the formation of an eye feature , the NHC upgraded Howard to a hurricane early on September 1 while the storm was located about 420 mi ( 675 km ) southwest of Manzanillo , Colima . Later that day , the eye of Howard became apparent on satellite imagery , which organized into a pinhole eye surrounded by a ring of symmetric , deep convection . At 0600 UTC on September 2 , Howard was upgraded to a major hurricane — a storm with winds of 111 mph ( 178 km / h ) or higher . Shortly after , the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a low @-@ end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , with winds of 140 mph ( 220 km / h ) while located about 410 mi ( 660 km ) south @-@ southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur . 
 Not long after reaching peak intensity , the storm moved over cooler waters , causing the eyewall to deteriorate and cloud tops to warm . The next day , the eye of Howard disappeared from satellite imagery , leading to the cyclone being downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane . Continued deterioration of the system caused rapid weakening , with Howard being downgraded to a tropical storm by 1200 UTC on September 4 . Convection associated with the storm was separated from the center later that day . Early on September 5 , Howard was further downgraded to a tropical depression and later degenerated into a non @-@ convective remnant low pressure area about 265 mi ( 425 km ) west @-@ southwest of Punta Eugenia , Mexico . The remnants of the hurricane continued towards the northwest before turning towards the southwest the following day as it tracked along the southeast side of a ridge of high pressure . The low continued in this general direction until it dissipated on September 10 about 1 @,@ 150 mi ( 1 @,@ 850 km ) west of Cabo San Lucas , Mexico . 
 = = Preparations and Impact = = 
 Because Howard remained away from land no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued . One ship , the Strong Virginian , reported sustained winds 42 mph ( 68 km / h ) at 0600 UTC on September 4 . Along the Baja California Peninsula , 16 – 18 ft ( 4 @.@ 8 – 5 @.@ 4 m ) swells were reported . All ships were required to remain at port due to the rough seas . Heavy rains in the mountainous and Pacific coastal areas of Baja California produced flooding which washed out several roads in San José del Cabo . The rains did help increase water levels in some reservoirs in Baja California . An estimated 2 @,@ 000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged by the storm and 48 households were damaged throughout four communities . State and federal authorities purchased temporary homes for those who needed shelter in the affected areas . The State Civil Protection in Mexico provided rehabilitation for a total of 393 homes affected by Howard . 
 Large swells produced by the storm resulted in about 1 @,@ 000 lifeguard rescues in Orange County , California . High temperatures in southern California , exceeding 100 ° F ( 37 @.@ 7 ° C ) in places , and cool ocean temperatures led to an estimated 575 @,@ 000 people going to beaches during the Labor Day weekend . One incident required 25 rescues as dozens of people were overwhelmed by 8 – 10 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 – 3 m ) waves . Officials in San Bernardino County advised residents to take precautions for the possibility of flooding as a result of moisture from the remnants of Howard . Following wildfires in 2003 , foothills were highly susceptible to flooding . Residents were advised to have sandbags ready , ensure their emergency supplies were stocked and have an evacuation plan . Despite all the preparations undertaken , Howard did not produced any rainfall in California . The moisture also enhanced rainfall across portions of Arizona . This led to minor rainfall accumulations throughout the state . 
 = Irving Gottesman = 
 Irving Isadore Gottesman ( December 29 , 1930 – June 29 , 2016 ) was an American professor of psychology who devoted most of his career to the study of the genetics of schizophrenia . He has written 17 books and more than 290 other publications , mostly on schizophrenia and behavioral genetics , and created the first academic program on behavioral genetics in the United States . He has won awards such as the Hofheimer Prize for Research , the highest award from the American Psychiatric Association for psychiatric research . Lastly , Gottesman was a professor in the psychology department at the University of Minnesota , where he received his Ph.D. 
 A native of Ohio , Gottesman studied psychology for his undergraduate and graduate degrees , became a faculty member at various universities , and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota . He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of genetics and the family , social , cultural , and economic environment to the onset , progress , and inter @-@ generational transmission of the disorder . Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow @-@ up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic . He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence . Gottesman and co @-@ researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics — the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment from other parts of the genome — to the field of psychiatric genetics . 
 Gottesman has written and co @-@ written a series of books which summarize his work . These publications include raw data from various studies , their statistical interpretation , and possible conclusions presented with necessary background material . The books also include first @-@ hand accounts of schizophrenic patients and relatives tending to them , giving an insight into jumbled thoughts , the disorder 's primary symptom . Gottesman and Shields have built models to explain the cause , transmission , and progression of the disorder , which is controlled by many genes acting in concert with the environment , with no cause sufficient by itself . 
 = = Background = = 
 Gottesman was born in Cleveland , Ohio , in 1930 , to Bernard and Virginia Gottesman ( née <unk> ) , who were Hungarian – Romanian Jewish immigrants . He was educated at Miles Standish Elementary and a public school in Cleveland 's Shaker Heights . After leaving school , Gottesman joined the United States Navy , where he was given a scholarship and the rank of midshipman , and was assigned to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago . He first specialized in physics but changed to psychology , receiving his B.S. degree in 1953 . 
 Gottesman did his graduate work at the University of Minnesota , which then patterned its clinical psychology program on the Boulder model , which emphasized research theory and clinical practice . He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy , supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill . He began investigating personality traits in identical and fraternal twins who had filled out the Minnesota <unk> Personality Inventory ( MMPI ) . His Ph.D. thesis , submitted to Psychological Monographs , was rejected before a review on the grounds that the nature – nurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture . On appeal , the thesis was reviewed and accepted for publication . 
 Gottesman began his career at Harvard University as a social relations and psychology lecturer . This non @-@ tenure @-@ track position ended after three years . Then he worked with researcher James Shields at the Maudsley – Bethlem hospital complex in London , using its twin registry to analyze traits of identical and fraternal twins at the lab of Eliot Slater , whom Gottesman met in Rome at the Second International Congress on Human Genetics in 1961 . After his return to the University of Minnesota in 1966 , Gottesman created a program on behavioral genetics , the first in the U.S. In 1972 – 1973 he received a Guggenheim fellowship to work with <unk> Christiansen in Denmark . In 1980 he left to join the Washington University School of Medicine , then moved to the University of Virginia in 1985 , where he started the clinical psychology training program . Gottesman continued <unk> London and collaborating with Shields , with whom he co @-@ wrote a series of <unk> spending 16 years at the University of Virginia , Gottesman retired from an active role after 41 years of research , but continues research part @-@ time in psychology and psychiatry . 
 From 2011 till his death , Gottesman was a professor with an endowed chair in adult psychiatry and a senior fellow in psychology at the University of Minnesota ; a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , the Academy of Clinical Psychology , and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University ; a Guggenheim Fellow for 1972 – 1973 at the University of Copenhagen ; an emeritus in psychology with a chair endowment at the University of Virginia ; and an honorary fellow at the London Royal College of Psychiatrists . He has advised 35 graduate students , and an annual lecture on behavior and <unk> has been established in his name by the University of Virginia . Gottesman was married to Carol <unk> , whom he wed on December 23 , 1970 ; they had two sons . Gottesman died June 29 , 2016 .

 Gottesman first studied the genetics of schizophrenia on a large scale using the Maudsley – Bethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years . Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and genomics . In his Twin Cities MMPI study , part of his Ph.D. thesis , Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia , depression , anti @-@ social personality disorder , and social introversion . Genes strongly influenced social introversion and aggressive tendencies . This led to further studies on personality traits of identical twins such as the Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart . 
 Analyzing the results of the Maudsley – Bethlem study , Gottesman and Shields devised the multi @-@ element , polygenic causation model for schizophrenia by modeling schizophrenia diagnoses using the recently introduced liability @-@ threshold model . The book that summarized and expanded on the study , Schizophrenia and Genetics : A Twin Study Vantage Point , argued that schizophrenia is a product of several genes acting together , and introduced the techniques of precise analysis in the field of behavioral <unk> and Shields introduced terms such as " reaction ranges / surface " , " <unk> " and " epigenetic puzzle " into the behavioral sciences . The threshold model hypothesized that both genetic and environmental risks combined to produce schizophrenia , and pushed an individual into a diagnosable condition when their influence grew strong enough . The reaction range concept is the idea that the genes and the environment control behavior , but with separate upper and lower limits on the strength of that control in each case , a concept now part of basic psychology . Before the study , the prevailing opinion was that schizophrenia originated from bad parental relationships . The researchers showed identical twins were more likely to either have or not have schizophrenia together , concluding the disorder was the " outcome of a genetically determined developmental predisposition " . 
 The Maudsley – Bethlem study also hypothesized that schizophrenia was caused by a mixture of many small traits working together . These <unk> could be used for diagnosis . <unk> have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior , acted on by the environment and chance elements , with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children . Molecular @-@ biological studies in genetics have referred to <unk> to explain genetic causes of psychopathology . The researchers also examined how <unk> , those with mild , schizophrenia @-@ like personality disorders , were linked to schizophrenics . Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics . The researchers had hypothesized that <unk> in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene , one in a non @-@ schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk , expressed itself . The twin study did not confirm this . 
 In the Denmark study , the researchers evaluated the extent to which genes underpin psychopathology . Their twin studies of criminality found that a genetic disposition to poor self @-@ control caused both identical twins to become felons , or to not become felons . They also studied identical twins who were discordant for schizophrenia , where one twin was schizophrenic and the other not , and found children of such twins had equal genetic vulnerability to the disease . A later study in the mid @-@ 1980s , resulting in a paper awarded the Kurt Schneider Prize , concluded that children of identical twins were at higher risk than those of fraternal twins , indicating the non @-@ schizophrenic identical twin passed on a latent genetic disposition , even if it had not been expressed through <unk> . The Denmark study introduced the concepts of " unexpressed genotypes " — the latent genetic risk , and " epigenetic control " — the biochemical regulation of how genes work , into the new field of behavioral genetics . 
 = = = Studies on delinquency and violence = = = 
 In a 1989 review of the research on juvenile delinquency and violence , <unk> <unk> and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous , and genes contributed more to the continuous type . In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then @-@ prevalent idea of <unk> being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families . They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz <unk> and the studies she cited had missed an element : children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents . 
 Gottesman was one of the presenters at the 1995 conference at the Aspen Institute in Maryland on how strongly genes controlled a person 's leaning toward violence and crime . Gottesman presented results from studies on the influence of genes in criminality , stating that identical twins separated at birth were likely to show similar levels of criminal behavior . This concordance indicated that genes influenced such behavior . He did point out that behavioral patterns were strongly influenced by the environment and not set by genes alone . The conference , funded by the National Institutes of Health , was contentious , with detractors arguing that such studies would lead to minority groups , more likely to be criminals because they had lower social status or were poor , being targeted with gene therapy for violence . Protesters disrupted the conference and swarmed into the auditorium . Gottesman reasserted his belief that scientists should proceed with the research , not waiting for humanity to become ethical enough not to misuse it . 
 = = = Work on IQ = = = 
 In 1972 , Gottesman was called before the United States Senate by senator Walter Mondale to discuss the then 15 @-@ point IQ gap separating African Americans and white Americans . Gottesman testified that genes influenced IQ , but only in conjunction with elements such as schooling , money , and nutritious food from childhood onwards . In 2003 , he and colleagues published a study showing that heritability was higher for IQ differences within high socioeconomic status ( SES ) people than among low SES people . Genes influenced differences in test scores more in high SES children than in low SES children . Gottesman said that this was because genes have a weaker influence than poverty . 
 = = = Humanistic views = = = 
 Gottesman has researched and published about the abuse of genetic research in Nazi Germany , and has provided expert testimony in a Chinese human rights case involving schizophrenia in the family . His scholarly books on schizophrenia have also focused on the human costs of the disorder . In Schizophrenia Genesis : The Origins of Madness , he provided chapters in which patients describe their experiences of the disease , and those of their families . Gottesman has emphasized that genetics influences patients ' behavior in concert with the family , social , economic , and cultural contexts . According to him , random events are the third element determining behavior and destiny , and the interaction between these elements is known only at the level of probabilities , and not as fixed and precise quantities .

 Gottesman has authored nine books , all related to schizophrenia and psychiatric genetics . 
 = = = Schizophrenia and Genetics : A Twin Study Vantage Point = = = 
 Gottesman and Shields published Schizophrenia and Genetics to document their twin @-@ study research at the Maudsley Hospital in London , the work that in part earned them the Hofheimer Prize for Research , the highest award for psychiatric research from the American Psychiatric Association . The study expanded on an earlier one by Eliot Slater at the same hospital , covering 24 identical and 33 fraternal twins , with at least one from every pair a schizophrenic being treated at the hospital between 1948 and 1964 . This study was one of eleven such in the contemporary literature , and the book detailed the methodology and analytic detail differentiating it from the others . 
 Chapters on methodology comprise a third of the book 's core . Identical and fraternal twins were classified using fingerprints and blood groups . Follow @-@ up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients ( the <unk> ) and their twins , some schizophrenic and others not . Two psychological tests — the MMPI and the Object Sorting Test ( Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation ) — were used to measure mental traits and functioning . Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen @-@ Moller , and these were sent , with data on identical @-@ or @-@ fraternal @-@ twin status and diagnosis @-@ of @-@ schizophrenia removed , to six judges from the U.S. , U.K. and Japan . The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic . 
 Results of studies comprise another third of the core of Schizophrenia and Genetics . The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures . The study was not designed to find the genes responsible , but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in <unk> elements responsible could not be identified , though some , such as an overly protective mother , birth order , natal weight , and social and economic elements were ruled out . Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non @-@ schizophrenic status , but only one @-@ eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis . MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs . The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations . Those <unk> than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk . 
 The book presents case histories of all the twin @-@ pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses . Its last chapters put the results in the context of existing studies , and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder . The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature , and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia . The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures . The model provided no specific therapeutic insight , but was useful as a guideline for further study .

The book introduces methods for diagnosing schizophrenia in a research setting , taking into account national differences in how the disorder was defined , debunked myths such as the mother transmitting schizophrenia , and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range . 
 The book provided a tutorial on genetics to make the material self @-@ contained . Family , adoption and twin studies were investigated to determine the ways vulnerability to the disorder changed with genetic similarity to the patient . Together they supported the presence of a genetic contribution to the cause and the progress of schizophrenia . Contextual elements such as birth problems and stressful incidents were also analyzed to help the authors build a combined model to explain the disorder . The researchers analyzed populations to determine the role of genes using simplified mathematical models of the influence of genes and the environment on each other , and with no biochemical signal of the disorder to guide them . Rue L. Cromwell , writing in <unk> , wrote that this approach lacked rigor . The role of genes was less emphasized in the results , with a heritability of 70 % , than in earlier studies by Kallman . The researchers investigated neuroanatomy , and specifically the neurotransmitter dopamine , as a possible route by which genes influence the functioning of the brain to produce the symptoms of the disorder . 
 The authors investigated autism and psychiatric disorders among children , but found little relation to adult schizophrenia or genetic influence . They also covered the social implications of the disease , concluding that most schizophrenics were poor because the disorder eroded their resources and abilities . A chapter was devoted to social issues , violence , illnesses , death rates , sexual aspects , and the ability to father or bear children affecting schizophrenics . The authors provided data on the chance of relapse after an episode of the disorder . The book covered new methods and new models for studying schizophrenia . Because the disorder had no unanimously accepted diagnostic criteria , the researchers asked six clinicians and three colleagues to provide their analyses on the reports on 120 twins , and found an agreement of 86 % among the clinicians . Averaging the criteria of the clinicians produced a set close to that of Manfred Bleuler , who had adapted it from Emil Kraepelin .

 Schizophrenia Genesis : The Origins of Madness , written in 1991 , won the William James award from the American Psychological Association . It extensively reviewed how science has looked at schizophrenia . The book presented a vulnerability / diathesis – stress model to explain the causes of the disorder and a many @-@ cause , many @-@ gene model to explain how it is passed from parents to children . The book has been translated into Japanese and German . Schizophrenia Genesis was written for both the lay person and the clinical professional , and provides data , methods of interpreting the data , and an introduction to genetic analysis as used to analyze role of inheritance in behavior . The book also contains accounts of schizophrenics , with an artist depicting own suffering , saying , " I know ... it is craziness when every laugh is about me ... newspapers suddenly contain cures ... sparkles of light are demon eyes . " 
 Schizophrenia Genesis starts with the history of schizophrenia . Gottesman takes the view that schizophrenia is a disease of the industrial world. because it is not mentioned in the Bible , by the ancient Greeks , the ancient physicians , or authors including Shakespeare . He saw it first mentioned by physicians in 1809 and by Balzac in a short story in 1832 , showing minimally the disorder had by then been recognized as such . In 1896 , Kraepelin defined its symptoms , and his student Ernst <unk> began a genetic study of its transmission in 1916 . } The book noted that schizophrenia existed across cultures and its rates had stayed steady for fifty years . 
 A chapter was devoted to criteria for determining schizophrenia , with Gottesman preferring those developed by Bleuler to those in the American Psychiatric Association ’ s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( version III @-@ R ) , the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD @-@ 9 ) and Kurt Schneider ’ s method . Diagnosis was based on the ways a person spoke and acted , and the standard measures were hallucinations , delusions , emotional apathy , jumbled thought , and sudden changes in a person . Gottesman mentioned a disparity in schizophrenia diagnosis after World War II across the Atlantic , when U.S. psychiatric diagnoses quadrupled those of British psychiatrists . 
 Family studies on schizophrenia were reviewed . That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited , since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children . Twin and adoption studies were presented as the standard methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment . Gottesman used a computer @-@ based method for calculating the odds of becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes . The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large , larger @-@ scale ones exemplified by the eugenics policies of states such as Nazi Germany . Two final chapters cover molecular biology and neuroanatomy briefly . Newer methods of behavioral genetics being researched at the time of publication , such as linkage analysis which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together , were not covered .
