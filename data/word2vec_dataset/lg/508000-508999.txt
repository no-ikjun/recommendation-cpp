 The pivot catapult , known as the traction trebuchet , had existed in China since the Warring States period ( as evidenced by the <unk> ) . It was regularly used in sieges during the Han dynasty , by both besiegers and the besieged . The most common projectile weapon used during the Han dynasty was the small handheld , trigger @-@ activated crossbow ( and to a lesser extent , the repeating crossbow ) , first invented in China during the 6th or 5th century BCE . Although the nomadic Xiongnu were able to twist their waists slightly while horse @-@ riding and shoot arrows at targets behind them , the official Chao Cuo ( d . 154 BCE ) deemed the Chinese crossbow superior to the Xiongnu bow . 
 The Han Chinese also employed chemical warfare . In quelling a peasant revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE , the imperial Han forces had horse @-@ drawn chariots carrying bellows that were used to pump powdered lime ( calcium oxide ) at the rebels , who were dispersed . In this same instance , they also lit incendiary rags tied to the tails of horses , so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines and disrupt their formations . 
 To deter pursuits of marching infantry or riding cavalry , the Han Chinese made caltrops ( barbed iron balls with sharp spikes sticking out in all directions ) that could be scattered on the ground and pierce the feet or hooves of those who were unaware of them . 
 = Chickasaw Turnpike = 
 The Chickasaw Turnpike is a short two @-@ lane toll road in the rural south central region of the U.S. state of Oklahoma . It stretches for 13 @.@ 3 miles ( 21 @.@ 4 km ) from north of Sulphur to just south of Ada . The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority ( OTA ) owns , maintains , and collects tolls on the turnpike . The first section of the Chickasaw Turnpike opened on September 1 , 1991 . 
 The Chickasaw resulted from a compromise between urban and rural legislators . Originally , it was part of a now @-@ canceled plan to connect southern and eastern Oklahoma with a longer turnpike . It was also intended to link Ada to the Interstate system . A four @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) segment of the turnpike was transferred to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation ( ODOT ) , making it a toll @-@ free road , in 2011 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The Chickasaw Turnpike takes a southwest @-@ to @-@ northeast route , passing through only two counties , Murray and <unk> . The turnpike begins in Murray County at U.S. Highway 177 ( US @-@ 177 ) north of Sulphur ; west of this interchange , the road becomes State Highway 7 Spur ( SH @-@ 7 Spur ) . The turnpike continues northeast into <unk> County . Just north of the county line is a barrier toll plaza , the only plaza along the route . Beyond the tollbooth lies an interchange serving the town of Roff . This is a partial interchange , providing access to Roff for eastbound travelers and access to the westbound lanes from Roff . The Chickasaw Turnpike then ends at SH @-@ 1 . 
 The Chickasaw Turnpike has only two lanes for the majority of its length ; however , there is a short eastbound passing lane . The Chickasaw is the only two @-@ lane turnpike in Oklahoma . Lightly traveled , the road is used by about 2 @,@ 000 vehicles per day . 
 = = History = = 
 The Chickasaw Turnpike was originally envisioned as a corridor running from Interstate 35 ( I @-@ 35 ) near Davis to I @-@ 40 near Henryetta . Proposed by southern Oklahoma politicians , the turnpike was intended to promote economic development by connecting Ada to the Interstate Highway System . It was proposed at the same time as three other turnpikes , which would become the Kilpatrick Turnpike in Oklahoma City , the Creek Turnpike in Tulsa , and the Cherokee Turnpike , which bypassed a mountainous section of US @-@ 412 in eastern Oklahoma . Rural legislators objected to the Kilpatrick and Creek Turnpikes , and moved to block them unless the Chickasaw Turnpike was built . Urban legislators relented and allowed the Chickasaw to be built as part of a compromise , with legislation requiring that the Chickasaw be built before work on the other two turnpikes could begin . The turnpike was authorized in 1987 . 
 Governor Henry Bellmon opposed the Chickasaw Turnpike , arguing it would be a money loser . Bellmon had the turnpike built with only two lanes and shortened it to its current termini . Dewey F. Bartlett , Jr . , an OTA board member ( and future mayor of Tulsa ) , was later quoted as saying " I think it stinks . We never wanted to build it . It was not anything we thought was appropriate . But in order to build the three turnpikes that were necessary , that is the only way they would build it . " 
 Bonds for the first section were approved in 1989 . The bonds specifically permitted the turnpike to be transferred to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation and become a free road , the only turnpike in Oklahoma eligible for this type of transfer . At the time , however , ODOT director Bobby Green said that his agency could not buy the turnpike due to a lack of funds . The Chickasaw cost nearly $ 44 million to build ( equivalent to $ 64 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) . Its first section opened on September 1 , 1991 . Originally , the turnpike began at SH @-@ 7 west of Sulphur , proceeding northeast to the US @-@ 177 junction , then continuing northeast on its present @-@ day alignment . 
 As part of his 1994 turnpike package , Governor David Walters proposed expanding the Chickasaw Turnpike to four lanes and extending it to Henryetta . The Chickasaw improvements were eventually cut from the package , which ultimately died when a commission overseeing the sale of bonds by state agencies voted against it . 
 The OTA voted on November 11 , 2002 , to open discussions about transferring the Chickasaw to ODOT . The transfer would also include a one @-@ time payment of $ 14 million ( equivalent to $ 20 @.@ 5 million in 2015 ) for maintenance . The turnpike had deteriorated since its original construction ; ODOT director Gary Ridley said that recurrent pavement problems necessitated constant repairs . He also mentioned that there were other issues , such as right @-@ of @-@ way problems , that could endanger ODOT 's ability to draw from the federal highway trust fund . House Speaker Pro Tempore @-@ designate Danny Hilliard opposed the transfer on the grounds of the road 's poor condition , as well as objecting to the partial interchanges . The lawmaker called the Chickasaw Turnpike " an albatross " and said " I told them that unless the Turnpike Authority brought that turnpike up to ODOT specifications , and completed the interchanges at Roff and US @-@ 177 north at Sulphur [ sic ] , we 're not interested in having that thing dumped on the taxpayers . " 
 To address these concerns , OTA began a $ 12 @.@ 8 @-@ million ( equivalent to $ 15 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) pavement rehabilitation project on February 9 , 2006 . Construction constraints required the entire turnpike to be closed in March , causing traffic problems in Sulphur . The turnpike reopened on September 29 , 2006 . The Oklahoma Transportation Commission , which oversees ODOT , voted on August 6 , 2007 , to begin feasibility and cost – benefit analysis studies towards accepting the four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) of the turnpike between SH @-@ 7 and US @-@ 177 . On August 1 , 2011 , the Transportation Commission voted to transfer the section of the turnpike west of US @-@ 177 to ODOT , designating it SH @-@ 7 Spur . The commission noted that OTA had raised the new SH @-@ 7 Spur to meet ODOT standards , and that expansion of the US @-@ 177 interchange to full access was the responsibility of ODOT . This was the first time that a turnpike had been transferred from OTA to ODOT . Transferring the turnpike was considered an inexpensive way to solve the problem of excessive truck traffic in Sulphur . 
 = = Tolls = = 
 As of 2009 , passengers of two @-@ axle vehicles ( such as cars and motorcycles ) pay tolls of 65 ¢ in cash or 55 ¢ if Pikepass is used . Drivers in vehicles with more than two axles , such as truckers , pay higher tolls . Tolls are collected at the single barrier toll plaza between the US @-@ 177 and Roff interchanges . Due to the partial interchanges , it is not possible to legally use the turnpike without passing through this toll plaza . The toll is the same regardless of the point of entry or exit . 
 The Chickasaw Turnpike has been fully automated since shortly after it opened . As Governor Bellmon predicted , it has been a consistent money loser since opening . Improvements are funded largely through proceeds from the more profitable Turner and Will Rogers Turnpikes .

 = Boeing CH @-@ 47 Chinook in Australian service = 
 The Australian Defence Force has operated Boeing CH @-@ 47 Chinook heavy @-@ lift helicopters for most of the period from 1974 . Twelve CH @-@ 47C Chinooks were acquired initially , entering service with the Royal Australian Air Force in December 1974 . The eleven surviving aircraft were retired in 1989 as a cost @-@ saving measure , but it was found that the Australian Defence Force 's other helicopters could not emulate their capabilities . As a result , four of the CH @-@ 47Cs were upgraded to CH @-@ 47D status , and returned to service in 1995 with the Australian Army . The Army acquired two more CH @-@ 47Ds in 2000 and another pair in 2012 . The CH @-@ 47Ds were replaced with seven new CH @-@ 47F aircraft during 2015 , and another three were delivered in 2016 . 
 The Chinooks have mainly been used to support Army units in Australian service , though they have performed a wide range of other tasks . Three Chinooks took part in the Iraq War during 2003 , when they supported Australian special forces . A detachment of two Chinooks was also deployed to Afghanistan during the northern spring and summer months for each year between 2006 and 2013 , when they saw extensive combat . Two of the CH @-@ 47s deployed to Afghanistan were destroyed as a result of crashes . 
 = = Acquisition = = 
 During the early years of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) considered new types of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF 's obsolete Douglas Dakotas . The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately for this role , and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 4 Caribous . However , the RAAF regarded the Caribou as inadequate for this role and preferred to acquire a more sophisticated aircraft type , leading to delays in the selection process . 
 This disagreement came to an end in September 1962 , when as part of the expansion of the military in response to Indonesia 's policy of " confrontation " with its neighbours , the RAAF was directed by the government to conduct an urgent evaluation of short takeoff and landing aircraft and heavy @-@ lift helicopters , which could be purchased to improve the Army 's tactical mobility . A team of seven RAAF officers headed by Group Captain Charles Read , the director of operational requirements , was dispatched to the United States and assessed the Sikorsky S @-@ 61 , Vertol 107 @-@ II and CH @-@ 47 Chinook helicopters . The team judged the Chinook to be clearly the most suitable of these types , and recommended that several be acquired ; this was in line with the Army 's preference . The government subsequently accepted a recommendation made by the RAAF to acquire a package of twelve Caribou fixed @-@ wing aircraft and eight Chinooks , and placed an order for these aircraft within weeks of the evaluation being ordered . The Chinook order was subsequently cancelled by the government when it was learned that it would take several years for the helicopters to be delivered , and the RAAF 's orders of Caribous and Bell UH @-@ 1 Iroquois tactical transport helicopters were instead expanded . 
 The Australian military continued to consider the acquisition of a heavy @-@ lift helicopters throughout the 1960s , and a formal program was launched by the RAAF in 1969 . Another team of RAAF officers travelled to the United States , and evaluated the Sikorsky CH @-@ 53 and the Chinook . The team leader , Group Captain Peter Raw , ultimately recommended that CH @-@ 53s be ordered . Senior RAAF officers and the Army were not pleased with this outcome , and the Air Board rejected Raw 's report . Read , who was now an air vice @-@ marshal and deputy chief of the air staff , was directed to review the choice of helicopters , and again recommended that Chinooks be acquired . He justified this choice on the grounds that the Chinook could carry more cargo than the CH @-@ 53 and was better suited for operations in the mountains of the Australian @-@ administered Territory of Papua and New Guinea . Read 's recommendation was accepted by the government , and an order for twelve CH @-@ 47C Chinooks was placed in August 1970 . It was planned to rotate the helicopters in and out of service , with six being available at any time . The order was suspended later in 1970 when a series of engine problems affected the United States Army 's CH @-@ 47Cs , but was reinstated in March 1972 after these issues were resolved . The total cost of the purchase was $ A37 million . The order made Australia the first export customer for the CH @-@ 47 . 
 It was decided to station the Chinooks at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , located at the midpoint between the Army 's main field formations based in the outskirts of Sydney in New South Wales and the north Queensland city of Townsville . Construction began on support facilities for the helicopters at Amberley shortly after the order for them was confirmed in 1972 . 
 = = Operational service = = 
 = = = Royal Australian Air Force = = = 
 No. 12 Squadron was re @-@ raised at Amberley on 3 September 1973 to operate the Chinooks . This unit had previously flown bombers between 1939 and 1948 before being renumbered as No. 1 Squadron . The twelve CH @-@ 47s were transported from the United States to Australia on board the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne , and were unloaded at Brisbane on 28 March 1974 . In April that year it was reported that six of the helicopters were to be placed in storage as a cost @-@ saving measure ; as of 1979 these aircraft had still not been flown . No. 12 Squadron began conducting training flights on 8 July 1974 , and the unit was declared operational in December the next year . 
 The Chinooks ' main role in RAAF service was to support the Army . The helicopters were used to transport troops , artillery guns , ammunition , fuel and other supplies . They also provided part of the aeromedical evacuation capability available to the Army . While the Chinooks generally operated in Northern Australia , they made frequent deployments to other parts of Australia , and No. 12 Squadron conducted an annual high @-@ altitude flying training exercise in Papua New Guinea . The CH @-@ 47Cs had a crew of four , comprising two pilots , a loadmaster and one other , and could transport up to 33 passengers or 11 @,@ 129 kilograms ( 24 @,@ 535 lb ) of cargo . In August 1980 , a CH @-@ 47 was flown from Amberley to Malaysia , and used to recover a Royal Malaysian Air Force S @-@ 61 helicopter that had crashed in a remote location . This was believed to have been the longest distance a helicopter had flown up to that time , and remains the longest flight to have been conducted by a RAAF helicopter . 
 During their RAAF service , the Chinooks also undertook a range of non @-@ military tasks . The helicopters frequently formed part of the Australian Defence Force 's response to natural disasters , including delivering food for people and livestock cut off by floods . They were also used for civilian construction tasks such as emplacing lighthouses and carrying air conditioning plants to the top of tall buildings . On two occasions Chinooks supported Queensland Police Service drug eradication efforts in remote parts of the state by transporting fuel for RAAF Iroquois helicopters and carrying seized narcotics . In August 1981 , two CH @-@ 47s lifted containers from the cargo ship <unk> Express to enable the vessel to be refloated after it ran aground in the Torres Strait . A similar operation was undertaken to free the <unk> Asia when it ran aground near Caloundra , Queensland , in November the same year . Another unusual task was conducted in December 1981 when a Chinook transported two bulldozers onto a grounded iron ore carrier near Port Hedland , Western Australia , so that they could be used to reposition the ship 's load . 
 The RAAF 's Chinook fleet suffered two serious accidents . On 26 June 1975 , A15 @-@ 011 crashed when one of its engine turbines disintegrated . No. 3 Aircraft Depot was assigned responsibility for repairing the helicopter , but it did not reenter service until 21 May 1981 as the maintenance unit lacked experience with major helicopter repairs . On 4 February 1985 , A15 @-@ 001 crashed into Perseverance Dam near Toowoomba , Queensland , after striking power wires . The helicopter 's pilot , an exchange officer from the Royal Air Force , was killed and the other three aircrew suffered minor injuries . The helicopter was written off and used as a fire training aid at Amberley . 
 In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley decided to transfer all of the RAAF 's Iroquois and Sikorsky S @-@ 70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army ; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time . In May 1989 the RAAF and Army jointly decided to withdraw the Chinooks from service . This decision was made to reduce costs , the Army believing that the Black Hawks would provide sufficient air lift capability . Due to the Chinooks ' high operating costs , only six of the helicopters were in service at the time . No. 12 Squadron ceased flying on 30 June 1989 , and was disbanded on 25 August that year . 
 = = = Australian Army = = = 
 While it was intended to sell the Chinooks after they were withdrawn from service , experience soon demonstrated that the Black Hawks were unable to fully replace them . In particular , it was found that heavy @-@ lift helicopters were needed to transport fuel supplies for the Black Hawks during exercises and operations . As a result , plans to sell the Chinooks were put on hold in late 1989 , and the Army and RAAF began investigating options to reactivate them . The 1991 Force Structure Review recommended that between four and six Chinooks be reintroduced to service to support the Black Hawks , with the helicopters preferably being upgraded to CH @-@ 47D standard . 
 A deal to upgrade several of the Chinooks was reached in May 1991 . Under this arrangement , seven of the surviving CH @-@ 47Cs were sold to the US Army for $ A40 million , with these funds being used to partly cover the cost of upgrading the remaining four to CH @-@ 47D status . The total cost of the project was $ A62 million , of which $ A42 million was required to upgrade the four helicopters and the remainder to cover the cost of spare parts , administration and new facilities for the Chinooks at Townsville . All eleven Chinooks were shipped to the United States in September 1993 , and the upgraded helicopters returned to Australia in 1995 . It was decided to transfer the Chinooks to the Australian Army , as by this time the RAAF no longer had significant expertise in operating the type . 
 The four CH @-@ 47Ds were assigned to C Squadron of the 5th Aviation Regiment , which was based at Townsville , and also comprised two squadrons equipped with Black Hawks and six Iroquois helicopters used as gunships . Two newly built CH @-@ 47Ds were ordered in 1998 , and joined the other four in 2001 . 
 Following their transfer to the Army , the Chinooks were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service . The first operational deployment of the Army Chinooks began in November 1997 , when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks departed for Papua New Guinea . This force was used to transport food supplies in the highlands of the country following a severe drought , and returned to Australia in March 1998 . 
 In 2003 a detachment of three CH @-@ 47Ds was deployed to the Middle East as part of the Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq . The detachment formed part of the Special Operations Task Group , and operated from Jordan to transport supplies and personnel to Australian special forces units operating in Western Iraq throughout the initial stage of the conflict . One of the tasks undertaken by the detachment was flying commandos from the 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment to Al Asad Airbase after the facility was captured by Special Air Service Regiment units . This deployment was the first time Australian military helicopters had participated in combat since the Vietnam War . 
 From 2006 to 2013 a detachment of two Chinooks operated in Afghanistan as part of the Australian forces deployed to the country . The initial detachment arrived at Kandahar International Airport in March 2006 , and was tasked with supporting the Australian Special Forces Task Group in the country . After the Special Forces Task Group was withdrawn in September 2013 the helicopters remained in the country and were used to support Coalition forces , with a particular emphasis on the Australian units which were located in <unk> Province . The detachment was withdrawn to Australia during the Afghan winters , but redeployed to the country each spring . By the end of the final rotation on 14 September 2013 the helicopters had flown more than 6 @,@ 000 hours in combat and transported almost 40 @,@ 000 personnel . 
 Two Australian CH @-@ 47Ds were destroyed in Afghanistan . On 30 May 2011 , A15 @-@ 102 crashed in Zabul Province , resulting in the death of an Army unmanned aerial vehicle pilot who was travelling on board as a passenger . As it was impractical to recover the helicopter , it was destroyed by Coalition forces . The official inquiry into the crash found that it was caused by a known issue in which Chinooks suffered uncommanded pitch oscillations while flying through dense altitudes , and that the aircrew had not been adequate trained to prevent such incidents . Another Chinook was written off following a hard landing in Kandahar Province on 22 June 2012 , resulting in minor injuries to one of its aircrew . Both of the Chinooks at Kandahar International Airport also suffered significant damage in April 2013 , when the airport was struck by a severe hail storm . Two CH @-@ 47Ds were purchased in December 2011 to replace A15 @-@ 102 . 
 In February 2010 the Australian Government gave final approval for the Army to purchase seven CH @-@ 47F Chinooks to replace the CH @-@ 47Ds . A contract for these helicopters was signed on 19 March that year . The total cost of the CH @-@ 47F project , including the construction of new facilities and the acquisition of two flight simulators , was $ 631 million . The Australian CH @-@ 47Fs are fitted with equipment to better enable them to operate from the Royal Australian Navy 's Canberra class landing helicopter dock vessels , but are otherwise identical to the aircraft operated by the US Army . 
 Australia 's first two CH @-@ 47Fs entered service with the 5th Aviation Regiment on 5 May 2015 . At this time it was planned for C Squadron to be fully operational with the new Chinooks by January 2017 . The seventh CH @-@ 47F was delivered three weeks ahead of schedule in September 2015 . A further three CH @-@ 47Fs were ordered in December 2015 for $ <unk> million , including spare parts , related equipment and some support costs . These helicopters were delivered two and half months earlier than planned in June 2016 . The 2016 Defence White Paper and its supporting documentation stated that the CH @-@ 47Fs will receive modifications to better enable them to perform aeromedical evacuation tasks by the 2025 – 26 financial year , and that it is intended to regularly upgrade the helicopters so that they can continue to be supported through the US military 's logistics system .

 = Panavia Tornado = 
 The Panavia Tornado is a family of twin @-@ engine , variable @-@ sweep wing multirole combat aircraft , which was jointly developed and manufactured by Italy , the United Kingdom , and West Germany . There are three primary Tornado variants : the Tornado IDS ( interdictor / strike ) fighter @-@ bomber , the suppression of enemy air defences Tornado ECR ( electronic combat / reconnaissance ) and the Tornado ADV ( air defence variant ) interceptor aircraft . 
 The Tornado was developed and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH , a tri @-@ national consortium consisting of British Aerospace ( previously British Aircraft Corporation ) , MBB of West Germany , and Aeritalia of Italy . It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979 – 1980 . Due to its multirole nature , it was able to replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces . The Royal Saudi Air Force ( RSAF ) became the only export operator of the Tornado in addition to the three original partner nations . A tri @-@ nation training and evaluation unit operating from RAF Cottesmore , the Tri @-@ National Tornado Training Establishment , maintained a level of international co @-@ operation beyond the production stage . 
 The Tornado was used by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , Italian Air Force and RSAF during the 1991 Gulf War , in which the Tornado conducted many low @-@ altitude penetrating strike missions . The Tornados of various operators were also used in conflicts in the former Yugoslavia during the Bosnian War and Kosovo War , the Iraq War , Libya during the Libyan civil war , as well as smaller roles in Afghanistan , Yemen , and Syria . Including all variants , 992 aircraft were built . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 During the 1960s , aeronautical designers looked to variable @-@ geometry wing designs to gain the manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings with the speed of swept wing designs . The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the TSR @-@ 2 and subsequent F @-@ 111K aircraft , and was still looking for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft . Britain and France had initiated the AFVG ( Anglo French Variable Geometry ) project in 1965 , but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967 . Britain continued to develop a variable @-@ geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG , and sought new partners to achieve this . 
 In 1968 , West Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium , Italy and Canada formed a working group to examine replacements for the Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighter , initially called the Multi Role Aircraft ( MRA ) , later renamed as the Multi Role Combat Aircraft ( MRCA ) . The participating nations all had ageing fleets that required replacing ; but , as the requirements were so diverse , it was decided to develop a single aircraft that could perform a variety of missions that were previously undertaken by a fleet of different aircraft . Britain joined the MRCA group in 1968 , represented by Air Vice @-@ Marshal Michael Giddings , and a memorandum of agreement was drafted between Britain , West Germany , and Italy in May 1969 . 
 By the end of 1968 , the prospective purchases from the six countries amounted to 1 @,@ 500 aircraft . Canada and Belgium had departed before any long @-@ term commitments had been made to the programme ; Canada had found the project politically unpalatable ; there was a perception in political circles that much of the manufacturing and specifications were focused on Western Europe . France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5 , which created doubt as to whether the MRCA would be worthwhile from Belgium 's operational perspective . 
 = = = Panavia Aircraft GmbH = = = 
 On 26 March 1969 , four partner nations – United Kingdom , Germany , Italy and the Netherlands , agreed to form a multinational company , Panavia Aircraft GmbH , to develop and manufacture the MRCA . The project 's aim was to produce an aircraft capable of undertaking missions in the tactical strike , reconnaissance , air defence , and maritime roles ; thus allowing the MRCA to replace several different aircraft then in use by the partner nations . Various concepts , including alternative fixed @-@ wing and single @-@ engine designs , were studied while defining the aircraft . The Netherlands pulled out of the project in 1970 , citing that the aircraft was too complicated and technical for the RNLAF 's preferences , which had sought a simpler aircraft with outstanding manoeuvrability . An additional blow was struck by the German requirement reduced from an initial 600 aircraft to 324 in 1972 . 
 When the agreement was finalised , the United Kingdom and West Germany each had a 42 @.@ 5 % stake of the workload , with the remaining 15 % going to Italy ; this division of the production work was heavily influenced by international political bargaining . The front fuselage and tail assembly was assigned to BAC ( now BAE Systems ) in the United Kingdom ; the centre fuselage to MBB ( now EADS ) in West Germany ; and the wings to Aeritalia ( now Alenia Aeronautica ) in Italy . Similarly , tri @-@ national <unk> was used for engines , general and <unk> equipment . A separate multinational company , Turbo @-@ Union , was formed in June 1970 to develop and build the RB199 engines for the aircraft , with ownership similarly split 40 % Rolls @-@ Royce , 40 % MTU , and 20 % FIAT . 
 At the conclusion of the project definition phase in May 1970 , the concepts were reduced to two designs ; a single seat Panavia 100 which West Germany initially preferred , and the twin @-@ seat Panavia 200 which the RAF preferred ( this would become the Tornado ) . The aircraft was briefly called the Panavia Panther , and the project soon coalesced towards the two @-@ seat option . In September 1971 , the three governments signed an Intention to <unk> ( ITP ) document , at which point the aircraft was intended solely for the low @-@ level strike mission , where it was viewed as a viable threat to Soviet defences in that role . It was at this point that Britain 's Chief of the Defence Staff announced " two @-@ thirds of the fighting front line will be composed of this single , basic aircraft type " . 
 = = = Prototypes and testing = = = 
 The first of more than a dozen Tornado prototypes took flight on 14 August 1974 at Manching , Germany ; the pilot , Paul Millett stated of the occasion : " Aircraft handling was delightful ... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did begin to wonder whether this was not yet another simulation " . Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications . <unk> disturbances were responded to by re @-@ profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting experienced at supersonic speeds . Testing revealed that a nose @-@ wheel steering augmentation system , connecting with the yaw damper , was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during landing rollouts . In August 1976 , Soviet espionage activities were exposed trying to obtain information on the aircraft . 
 Two prototypes were lost in accidents , both of which had been primarily caused by poor piloting decisions and errors leading to two ground collision incidents ; a third Tornado prototype was seriously damaged by an incident involving pilot @-@ induced pitch oscillation . During the type 's development , aircraft designers of the era were beginning to incorporate features such as more sophisticated stability augmentation systems and autopilots . Aircraft such as the Tornado and the General Dynamics F @-@ 16 Fighting Falcon made use of these new technologies . Failure testing of the Tornado 's triplex analogue command and stability augmentation system ( <unk> ) was conducted on a series of realistic flight control rigs ; the variable @-@ sweep wings in combination with varying , and frequently very heavy , payloads complicated the clearance process . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 The contract for the Batch 1 aircraft was signed on 29 July 1976 . The first aircraft were delivered to the RAF and German Air Force on 5 and 6 June 1979 respectively . The first Italian Tornado was delivered on 25 September 1981 . On 29 January 1981 , the Tri @-@ national Tornado Training Establishment ( <unk> ) officially opened at RAF Cottesmore , remaining active in training pilots from all operating nations until 31 March 1999 . The 500th Tornado to be produced was delivered to West Germany on 19 December 1987 . 
 Export customers were sought after West Germany withdrew its objections to exporting the aircraft ; Saudi Arabia was the only export customer of the Tornado . The agreement to purchase the Tornado was part of the controversial Al @-@ Yamamah arms deal between BAE Systems and the Saudi government . Oman had committed to purchasing Tornados and the equipment to operate them for a total value of £ 250 million in the late 1980s , but cancelled the order in 1990 due to financial difficulties . 
 During the 1970s , Australia considered joining the MRCA programme to find a replacement for their ageing Dassault Mirage IIIs ; ultimately the McDonnell Douglas F / A @-@ 18 Hornet was selected to meet the requirement . Canada similarly opted for the F / A @-@ 18 after considering the Tornado . Japan considered the Tornado in the 1980s , along with the General Dynamics F @-@ 16 Fighting Falcon and F / A @-@ 18 ; before selecting the Mitsubishi F @-@ 2 , a domestically produced design based on the F @-@ 16 . In the 1990s , both Taiwan and South Korea expressed interest in acquiring a small number of Tornado ECR aircraft . In 2001 , EADS proposed a Tornado ECR variant with a greater electronic warfare capability for Australia . 
 Production came to an end in 1998 ; the last batch of aircraft being produced going to the Royal Saudi Air Force , who had ordered a total of 96 IDS Tornados . In June 2011 , it was announced that the RAF 's Tornado fleet had flown collectively over one million flying hours . Aviation author John Lake noted that : " The <unk> Panavia Consortium produced just short of 1 @,@ 000 Tornados , making it one of the most successful postwar bomber programs " . In 2008 , <unk> Monthly said of the Tornado : " For more than a quarter of a century ... the most important military aircraft in Western Europe . " 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The Panavia Tornado is a multirole , twin @-@ engined aircraft designed to excel at low @-@ level penetration of enemy defences . The mission envisaged during the Cold War was the delivery of conventional and nuclear ordnance on the invading forces of the Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe ; this dictated several significant features of the design . Variable wing geometry , allowing for minimal drag during the critical low @-@ level dash towards a well @-@ prepared enemy , had been desired from the project 's start . Advanced navigation and flight computers , including the then @-@ innovative fly @-@ by @-@ wire system , greatly reduced the workload of the pilot during low @-@ level flight and eased control of the aircraft . For long range bombing missions , the Tornado has a retractable refuelling probe . 
 As a multirole aircraft , the Tornado is capable of undertaking more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission ; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado as a common type – the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance , maritime patrol duties , or dedicated electronic countermeasures ( ECM ) were phased out – either by standard Tornados or modified variants , such as the Tornado ECR . The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was the Tornado ADV , which was stretched and armed with long range anti @-@ aircraft missiles to serve in the interceptor role . 
 The Tornado operators have chosen to undertake various life extension and upgrade programmes to keep their Tornado fleets as viable frontline aircraft for the foreseeable future . The RAF and RSAF have upgraded their Tornados to the GR4 standard to increase combat effectiveness , while German Tornados have been undergoing periodic upgrades under the multi @-@ stage ASSTA ( Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada ) programme . With these upgrades , as of 2011 , it is projected that the Tornado shall be in service until 2025 , more than 50 years after the first prototype took flight . 
 = = = Variable @-@ sweep wing = = = 
 In order for the Tornado to perform well as a low @-@ level supersonic strike aircraft , it was considered necessary for it to possess good high @-@ speed and low @-@ speed flight characteristics . To achieve high @-@ speed performance , a swept or delta wing is typically adopted , but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds . To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness , the Tornado uses a variable @-@ sweep wing . This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft , such as the American General Dynamics F @-@ 111 Aardvark strike fighter , and the Soviet Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 23 fighter . The F @-@ 111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado ; however , the Tornado differs in being a multi @-@ role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics . 
 The level of wing sweep , the angle of the wings in relation to the fuselage , can be altered in flight at the pilot 's control . The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees , with a corresponding speed range for each angle ; some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing @-@ sweep system to reduce pilot workload . When the wings are swept back , the exposed wing area is lowered and drag is significantly decreased , which is conducive to performing high @-@ speed low @-@ level flight . The weapons pylons pivot with the angle of the variable @-@ sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions . 
 In development , significant attention was given to the Tornado 's short @-@ field take @-@ off and landing ( STOL ) performance . Germany , in particular , encouraged this design aspect . For shorter take @-@ off and landing distances , the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25 @-@ degree position , and deploy its full @-@ span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds . These features , in combination with the thrust reverser @-@ equipped engines , give the Tornado excellent low @-@ speed handling and landing characteristics . 
 = = = Avionics = = = 
 The Tornado features a tandem @-@ seat cockpit , crewed by a pilot and a navigator / weapons officer ; both electromechanical and electro @-@ optical controls are used to fly the aircraft and manage its systems . An array of dials and switches are mounted on either side of a centrally placed CRT monitor , controlling the navigational , communications , and weapons @-@ control computers . BAE Systems developed the Tornado Advanced Radar Display Information System ( TARDIS ) , a 32 @.@ 5 @-@ centimetre ( 12 @.@ 8 in ) multi @-@ function display , to replace the rear cockpit 's Combined Radar and Projected Map Display ; the RAF began installing TARDIS on the GR4 fleet in 2004 . 
 The primary flight controls of the Tornado are a fly @-@ by @-@ wire hybrid , consisting of an analogue quadruplex Command and Stability Augmentation System ( <unk> ) connected to a digital <unk> & Flight Director System ( <unk> ) ; in addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure . To enhance pilot awareness , artificial feel was built into the flight controls , such as the centrally located stick ; because of the Tornado 's variable wings enabling the aircraft to drastically alter its flight envelope , the artificial responses adjust automatically to wing profile changes and other changes to flight attitude . As a large variety of munitions and stores can be outfitted , the resulting changes to the aircraft 's flight dynamics are routinely compensated for by the flight stability system . 
 The Tornado incorporates a combined navigation / attack Doppler radar that simultaneously scans for targets and conducts fully automated terrain @-@ following for low @-@ level flight operations ; being readily able to conduct all @-@ weather hands @-@ off low @-@ level flight was considered one of the core advantages of the Tornado . The Tornado ADV has a different radar system to other variants , designated AI.24 Foxhunter , as it is designed for air defence operations ; it is capable of continuously keeping track of up to 20 targets at ranges of up to 160 kilometres ( 100 mi ) . The Tornado was one of the earliest aircraft to fitted with a digital data bus for data transmission . A link 16 JTIDS integration on the F3 variant enabled the exchange of radar and other sensory information with nearby friendly aircraft . 
 Some Tornado variants carry different avionics and equipment , depending on their mission . The Tornado ECR is devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defences ( SEAD ) missions , operated by Germany and Italy . The Tornado ECR is equipped with an emitter @-@ locator system ( ELS ) to spot radar use . German ECRs have a Honeywell infrared imaging system for reconnaissance flights . RAF and RSAF Tornados have the Laser Range Finder and Marked Target Seekers ( <unk> ) for targeting laser @-@ guided munitions . In 1991 , the RAF introduced TIALD , allowing Tornado GR1s to laser @-@ designate their own targets . 
 The GR1A and GR4A were equipped with TIRRS ( Tornado Infrared Reconnaissance System ) , consisting of one <unk> ( Sideways Looking Infra Red ) sensor on each side of the fuselage forward of the engine intakes to capture oblique images , and a single <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) sensor mounted on the fuselage 's underside to provide vertical images . TIRRS recorded images on six S @-@ VHS video tapes . The newer RAPTOR reconnaissance pod has replaced the built @-@ in TIRRS system . 
 = = = Armament and equipment = = = 
 The Tornado is cleared to carry the majority of air @-@ launched weapons in the NATO inventory , including various unguided and laser @-@ guided bombs , anti @-@ ship and anti @-@ radiation missiles , as well as specialised weapons such as anti @-@ personnel mines and anti @-@ runway munitions . To improve survivability in combat , the Tornado is equipped with onboard countermeasures , ranging from flare and chaff dispensers to electronic countermeasure pods that can be mounted under the wings . Underwing fuel tanks and a buddy store aerial refuelling system that allows one Tornado to refuel another are available to extend the aircraft 's range . 
 In the decades since the Tornado 's introduction , all of the Tornado operators have undertaken various upgrade and modification programmes to allow recently introduced weapons to be used by their squadrons . Amongst the new armaments that the Tornado has been adapted to deploy are the enhanced Paveway and Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs , and modern cruise missiles such as the Taurus and Storm Shadow missiles ; these upgrades have increased the Tornado 's capabilities and combat accuracy . Precision weapons such as cruise missiles have replaced older munitions such as cluster bombs . 
 Strike variants have a limited air @-@ to @-@ air capability with AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder or AIM @-@ 132 ASRAAM air @-@ to @-@ air missiles ( AAMs ) ; additionally the Tornado ADV is outfitted with beyond visual range AAMs such as the Skyflash and AIM @-@ 120 AMRAAM missiles . The Tornado is armed with two 27 mm ( 1 @.@ 063 in ) Mauser BK @-@ 27 revolver cannon internally mounted underneath the fuselage ; the Tornado ADV was only armed with one cannon . When the RAF GR1 aircraft were converted to GR4 , the FLIR sensor replaced the left hand cannon , leaving only one ; the GR1A reconnaissance variant gave up both its guns to make space for the sideways looking infra @-@ red sensors . The Mauser BK @-@ 27 was developed specifically for the Tornado , but has since been used on several other European fighters , such as the Dassault / Dornier Alpha Jet , Saab JAS 39 Gripen , and Eurofighter Typhoon . 
 The Tornado is capable of delivering air @-@ launched nuclear weapons . In 1979 , Britain considered replacing its Polaris submarines with either the Trident submarines or alternatively the Tornado as the main bearer of its nuclear deterrent . Although the UK proceeded with Trident , several Tornado squadrons based in Germany were assigned to SACEUR to deter a major Soviet offensive with both conventional and nuclear weapons , namely the WE.177 nuclear bomb , which was retired in 1998 . German and Italian Tornados are capable of delivering US B61 nuclear bombs , which are made available through NATO . 
 = = = Engine = = = 
 Britain considered the selection of Rolls @-@ Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential , and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer , to the point where the UK might have withdrawn over the issue . In September 1969 , Rolls @-@ Royce 's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA . One advantage over the US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed ; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company , Turbo @-@ Union . The programme was delayed by Rolls @-@ Royce 's entry into receivership in 1971 ; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme . Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units . 
 To provide the desired performance , several features were used in the <unk> To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2 , the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow . The hydraulic system is pressurised by <unk> power from both or either operational engine ; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability . In case of double @-@ engine , or double @-@ generator , failure , the Tornado has a single @-@ use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes . 
 Relatively rare amongst fighter aircraft , the RB.199 is fitted with thrust reversers to decrease the distance required to safely land . To fully deploy the thrust reverser during landings , the yaw damper is connected to the steering of the nosewheel to provide greater stability . 
 In August 1974 , the first RB.199 powered flight of a prototype Tornado occurred ; the engine completed its qualification tests in late 1978 . The final production standard engine met both reliability and performance standards , though the development cost had been higher than predicted , in part due to the ambitious performance requirements . At the time of the Tornado 's introduction to service , the turbine blades of the engine suffered from a shorter life span than desired , which was rectified by the implementation of design revisions upon early @-@ production engines . Several uprated engines were developed and used on both the majority of Tornado ADVs and Germany 's Tornado ECRs . The <unk> ( Digital Engine Control Unit ) is the current engine control unit for RB 199 engines superseding the analogue <unk> ( Main Engine Control Unit ) also known as <unk> . 
 = = = Upgrades = = = 
 Being designed for low @-@ level operations , the Tornado required modification to perform in medium level operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s . The RAF 's GR1 fleet was extensively re @-@ manufactured as Tornado GR4s . Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a Forward looking infrared , a wide @-@ angle HUD ( Head @-@ up display ) , improved cockpit displays , NVG ( Night vision devices ) capabilities , new avionics , and a Global Positioning System receiver . The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel , including the Storm Shadow cruise missile , the Brimstone anti @-@ tank missile , Paveway III laser @-@ guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated . The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997 , on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003 . In 2005 , the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF 's GR4 configuration . On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £ <unk> contract for CUSP , the Capability Upgrade Strategy ( Pilot ) . This project would see RAF GR4 / 4A improved in two phases , starting with the integration of the Paveway IV bomb and a communications upgrade , followed by a new tactical datalink in Phase B. 
 Beginning in 2000 , German IDS and ECR Tornados received the ASSTA 1 ( Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada ) upgrade . ASSTA 1 involved a replacement weapons computer , new GPS and Laser Inertial navigation systems . The new computer allowed the integration of the HARM III , HARM 0 Block IV / V and <unk> <unk> 350 missiles , the Rafael Litening II Laser <unk> Pod and GBU @-@ 24 Paveway III laser @-@ guided bombs . The ASSTA 2 upgrade began in 2005 , primarily consisting of several new digital avionics systems , a new ECM suite and provision for the Taurus cruise missile ; these upgrades are to be only applied to 85 Tornados ( 20 ECRs and 65 IDSs ) , as the Tornado is in the process of being replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon . The ASSTA 3 upgrade programme , started in 2008 , will introduce support for the laser @-@ targeted Joint Direct Attack Munition along with further software changes . 
 = = = = Test platform for 3 @-@ D printed parts = = = = 
 BAE Systems announced that , in December 2013 , the company had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment . The parts included a protective cover for the radio , a landing @-@ gear guard and air @-@ intake door support struts . The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado . The company claims that , with some of the parts costing less than £ 100 per piece to manufacture , 3D printing has already resulted in savings of more than £ 300 @,@ 000 and will offer further potential cost savings of more than £ 1 @.@ 2 million between now and 2017 .

 The first Tornado prototype made its first flight on 14 August 1974 from Manching airbase , in what was then West Germany . Deliveries of production Tornados began on 27 July 1979 . The total number of Tornados delivered to the German Air Force numbered 247 , including 35 ECR variants . Originally Tornados equipped five fighter @-@ bomber wings ( Geschwader ) , with one tactical conversion unit and four front line wings , replacing the Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighter . When one of the two Tornado wings of the German Navy was disbanded in 1994 , its aircraft were used to re @-@ equip a Luftwaffe 's reconnaissance wing formerly equipped with RF @-@ 4E Phantoms . 
 As many as 15 German Tornados undertook combat operations as a part of NATO 's campaign during the Bosnian War ; this was the first combat operation for the Luftwaffe since World War II . The Tornados , operating from in Piacenza , Italy , flew reconnaissance missions to survey damage inflicted by previous strikes and to scout targets for other aircraft to strike . These reconnaissance missions were reportedly responsible for a significant improvement in target selection throughout the campaign . 
 In 1999 , German and Italian Tornados participated in Operation Allied Force , NATO 's military operation against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War . The ECR aircraft would escort various allies ' aircraft while carrying several AGM @-@ 88 HARM missiles to counter attempted use of radar against the allied aircraft . During the Kosovo hostilities , Germany 's IDS Tornados would routinely conduct reconnaissance flights to identify both enemy ground forces and civilian refugees within Yugoslavia . 
 In June 2007 , a pair of Luftwaffe Tornado were controversially used to fly reconnaissance flights over an anti @-@ globalisation demonstration during the 33rd G8 summit in <unk> . Following the mission , the German Defence Ministry admitted one aircraft had broken the minimum flying altitude and that mistakes were made in the handling of security of the summit . 
 In 2007 , a detachment of six Tornados of the <unk> 51 " Immelmann " ( 51st reconnaissance wing ) were deployed to Mazar @-@ i @-@ Sharif , Northern Afghanistan , to support NATO forces . The decision to send Tornados to Afghanistan was a controversial decision , including one political party launching an unsuccessful legal bid to block the deployment as unconstitutional . In support of the Afghanistan mission , improvements in the Tornado 's reconnaissance equipment were accelerated ; improving the Tornado 's ability to detect hidden improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) . The German Tornados were withdrawn from Afghanistan in November 2010 . 
 Defence cuts announced in March 2003 resulted in the decision to retire 90 Tornados from Luftwaffe service . This led to a reduction in its Tornado strength to four wings by September 2005 . On 13 January 2004 , the then German Defence Minister Peter Struck announced further major changes to the German armed forces . A major part of this announcement is the plan to cut the German fighter fleet from 426 in early 2004 to 265 by 2015 . The German Tornado force is to be reduced to 85 , with the type expected to remain in service with the Luftwaffe until 2020 . The aircraft being retained have been undergoing a service life extension programme . Currently , the Luftwaffe operates Tornados with Tactical Wings Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 33 in <unk> / <unk> , Rhineland @-@ Palatinate and with Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 51 " Immelmann " in <unk> , Schleswig @-@ Holstein . Aircrew training takes place at <unk> <unk> der Luftwaffe , based on Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico , US . 
 = = = German Navy ( Marineflieger ) = = = 
 In addition to the order made by the Luftwaffe , the German Navy 's Marineflieger also received 112 of the IDS variant in the anti @-@ shipping and marine reconnaissance roles , again replacing the Starfighter . These equipped two wings , each with a nominal strength of 48 aircraft . The principal anti @-@ ship weapon was the <unk> Kormoran anti @-@ ship missile , which were initially supplemented by unguided bombs and BL755 cluster munitions , and later by AGM @-@ 88 HARM anti @-@ radar missiles . Pods fitted with panoramic optical cameras and an infrared line scan were carried for the reconnaissance mission . 
 The end of the Cold War and the signing of the CFE Treaty gave rise to a requirement for Germany to reduce the size of its armed forces , including the number of combat aircraft . To meet this need , one of the Marineflieger 's Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994 ; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing . The second wing was enlarged and continued in the anti @-@ shipping , reconnaissance and anti @-@ radar roles until it was disbanded in 2005 with its aircraft and duties passed on to the Luftwaffe . 
 = = = Italian Air Force ( Aeronautica Militare ) = = = 
 The first Italian prototype made its maiden flight on 5 December 1975 from Turin , Italy . The Aeronautica Militare received a total of 100 Tornado IDS . 16 IDSs were subsequently converted to the ECR configuration ; the first Italian Tornado ECR was delivered on 27 February 1998 . As a stop @-@ gap measure for 10 years , the Aeronautica Militare additionally operated 24 Tornado ADVs in the air defence role , which were leased from the RAF to cover the service gap between the retirement of the Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighter and the introduction of the Eurofighter Typhoon . 
 In 2000 , with major delays hampering the Eurofighter , the Aeronautica Militare began a search for another interim fighter . While the Tornado itself was considered , any long term extension to the lease would have involved upgrade to RAF CSP standard and thus was not considered cost effective . In February 2001 , Italy announced its arrangement to lease 35 F @-@ 16s from the United States . The Aeronautica Militare returned its Tornado ADVs to the RAF , with the final aircraft arriving at RAF Saint Athan on 7 December 2004 . One aircraft was retained for static display purposes . 
 Italian Tornados , along with RAF Tornados , took part in the first Gulf War in 1991 . Operation Locusta saw eight Tornado IDS interdictors deployed from Gioia del Colle , Italy , to Al Dhafra , Abu Dhabi , as a part of Italy 's contribution to the coalition . During the conflict , one aircraft was lost to Iraqi anti @-@ aircraft fire , the pilots ejected safely and were captured by Iraqi forces . 
 A total of 22 Italian Tornados were deployed in the NATO @-@ organised Operation Allied Force over Kosovo in 1999 , the IDS variant was used in the bombing role while the ECR variants patrolled the combat region , acting to suppress enemy anti @-@ aircraft radars , firing 115 AGM @-@ 88 HARM missiles . In response to anticipated violence during the 2010 Afghanistan elections , Italy , along with several other nations , increased its military commitment in Afghanistan , dispatching four IDS Tornados to the region . 
 Italian Tornado IDS and ECR aircraft participated in the enforcement of a UN no @-@ fly zone during the 2011 military intervention in Libya . Various coalition aircraft operated from bases in Italy , including RAF Tornados . Italian military aircraft delivered a combined 710 guided bombs and missiles during the strikes against Libyan targets . Of these Aeronautica Militare Tornados and AMX fighter @-@ bombers released 550 guided bombs and missiles , and Italian Navy AV @-@ 8Bs delivered 160 guided bombs . Italian Tornados launched 20 to 30 Storm Shadow cruise missiles with the rest consisting of Paveway and JDAM guided bombs . 
 In July 2002 , Italy signed a contract with the Tornado Management Agency ( <unk> ) and Panavia for the upgrading of 18 IDSs , the first of which was received in 2003 . The upgrade introduced improved navigation systems ( integrated GPS and laser INS ) and the ability to carry new weapons , including the Storm Shadow cruise missile , Joint Direct Attack Munition and Paveway III laser @-@ guided bombs . 
 Italy has opted to extend the Tornado 's service life at the expense of alternative ground @-@ attack aircraft such as the AMX International AMX ; in 2010 a major upgrade and life extension program was initiated , which will provide new digital displays , Link 16 communications capability , night @-@ vision goggles compatibility , and several other upgrades . In the long term , it is planned to replace the Tornado IDS / ECR fleet in Italian service with the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35 Lightning II , with the final Italian Tornado scheduled to be phased out in 2025 . 
 On 14 November 2014 , Italy announced it was sending four Tornado aircraft with 135 support staff to Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait in participation of coalition operations against the Islamic State . The four aircraft will be used for reconnaissance missions only .

 Nicknamed the " Tonka " by the British , the Tornado made its combat debut as part of the British contribution to the Gulf War in 1991 . Operation Granby saw nearly 60 RAF GR1s deploy to air bases at Muharraq in Bahrain and Tabuk and Dhahran in Saudi Arabia . Several Tornado ADVs were deployed to provide air cover , the threat of their long range missiles being a significant deterrent to Iraqi pilots , who would deliberately avoid combat when approached . 
 Early on in the conflict , the GR1s targeted military airfields across Iraq , deploying a mixture of 450 kg ( 1 @,@ 000 lb ) unguided bombs in loft @-@ bombing attacks and specialised JP233 runway denial weapons . Six RAF Tornados were lost in the conflict , four were lost while delivering unguided bombs , one was lost after delivering JP233 , and one trying to deliver laser @-@ guided bombs . On 17 January 1991 , the first Tornado to be lost was shot down by an Iraqi SA @-@ 16 missile following a failed low @-@ level bombing run . On 19 January , another RAF Tornado was shot down during an intensive raid on <unk> Air Base . The impact of the Tornado strikes upon Iraqi air fields is difficult to determine . 
 In an emergency deployment , the UK sent out a detachment of Blackburn Buccaneer aircraft equipped with the Pave Spike laser designator , allowing Tornado GR1s to drop precision guided weapons . A further crash programme in support of the sudden military action saw multiple GR1s outfitted with the TIALD laser designation system ; author Claus @-@ Christian <unk> declared that the TIALD pod enabled the GR1 to " achieve probably the most accurate bombing in the RAF 's history " . Although laser designation proved effective in the Gulf War , only 23 TIALD pods were purchased by 2000 ; shortages hindered combat operations over Kosovo . 
 Following the initial phase of the war , the GR1s switched to medium level strike missions , typical targets for these strikes included munition depots and oil refining facilities . Only the reconnaissance Tornado GR1As continued to operate at the low @-@ altitude high @-@ speed profile throughout the war , the GR1A emerged unscathed despite the inherent danger posed by missions such as conducting pre @-@ attack reconnaissance . In the war 's aftermath , Britain maintained a military presence in the Gulf , around half a dozen GR1s were based at Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait for operations over the southern no fly zone as part of Operation Southern Watch ; another half a dozen GR1s participated in missions over Northern Iraq in Operation Provide Comfort . 
 In March 1993 , a Mid @-@ Life Upgrade ( MLU ) project of the Tornado was launched to upgrade the GR1 / GR1A to GR4 / GR4A standard . The Tornado GR4 made its operational debut in Operation Southern Watch ; patrolling Iraq 's southern airspace from bases in Kuwait . Both Tornado GR1s and GR4s based at Ali Al Salem , Kuwait , took part in coalition strikes at Iraq 's military infrastructure during Operation Desert Fox in 1998 . In December 1998 , an Iraqi anti @-@ aircraft battery fired six to eight missiles at a patrolling Tornado , the battery was later attacked in retaliation , no aircraft were lost during the incident . It was reported that during Desert Fox RAF Tornados had successfully destroyed 75 % of allotted targets , and out of the 36 missions planned , 28 had been successfully completed . 
 The GR1 participated in the Kosovo War in 1999 . The Tornados initially operated from RAF Bruggen , Germany ; they later moved to <unk> Air Base , Corsica . Experience from fighting in Kosovo led to the RAF procuring AGM @-@ 65 Maverick missiles and Enhanced Paveway smart bombs for the Tornado fleet . Following the Kosovo War , the GR1 was phased out as more aircraft were upgraded to GR4 standard . The final GR1 was upgraded and returned to the RAF on 10 June 2003 . 
 The GR4 was heavily used in Operation Telic , the British contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq . RAF Tornados flew in the opening phase of the war , flying alongside American strike aircraft to rapidly attack key installations . Following an emphasis on minimising casualties , Tornados of No. 617 Squadron deployed the new Storm Shadow precision cruise missile for the first time in the Iraq conflict ; while 25 % of the UK 's air @-@ launched weapons in Kosovo were precision @-@ guided , four years later in Iraq this ratio increased to 85 % . 
 On 23 March 2003 , a Tornado GR4 was shot down over Iraq by friendly fire from a US Patriot missile battery , killing both crew members . In July 2003 , a US board of inquiry exonerated the battery 's operators , observing the Tornado 's " lack of functioning IFF ( Identification Friend or Foe ) " as a factor in the incident . Problems with Patriot were also suggested as a factor , multiple incidents of mis @-@ identification of friendly aircraft have occurred , including the fatal shootdown of a US Navy McDonnell Douglas F / A @-@ 18 Hornet a few weeks after the loss of the Tornado . Britain withdrew the last of its Tornados from Iraq in June 2009 . 
 In early 2009 , several GR4s arrived at Kandahar airfield , Afghanistan to replace the Harrier GR7 / 9 aircraft deployed there since November 2004 . In 2009 , Paveway IV guided bombs were brought into service on the RAF 's Tornados , having been previously used in Afghanistan by the Harrier II fleet . In Summer 2010 , extra Tornados were dispatched to Kandahar for the duration of the 2010 Afghan election . British Tornados ended their operations in Afghanistan in November 2014 . They flew over 5 @,@ 000 pairs sorties over 33 @,@ 500 hours , including 600 " shows of force " to deter Taliban attacks . During more than 70 engagements , some 140 Brimstone missiles and Paveway IV bombs were deployed in total ( roughly half each ) and over 3 @,@ 000 27 mm cannon shells were fired . 
 Prior to the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review ( SDSR ) ' s publication , the retirement of the entire Tornado fleet was under consideration , savings of £ 7 @.@ 5 billion were anticipated . The SDSR announced the Tornado would be retained at the expense of the Harrier II , although Tornado numbers are to decline in transition to the Eurofighter Typhoon , and later on , the F @-@ 35 Lightning II . 
 On 18 March 2011 , British Prime Minister David Cameron announced the deployment of Tornados and Typhoons to enforce a no @-@ fly zone in Libya . In March 2011 , several Tornados flew 3 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 4 @,@ 800 km ) strike missions against targets inside Libya in what were , according to Defence Secretary Liam Fox , " the longest range bombing mission conducted by the RAF since the Falklands conflict " . A variety of weapons were used in operations over Libya , including Laser @-@ guided bombs and Brimstone missiles . 59 RAF aircraft are receiving the CUSP avionics upgrade which achieved Initial Service Date ( ISD ) in March 2013 and the type will be withdrawn from RAF service on 31 March 2019 . 
 On 11 August 2014 , a Cabinet Office Briefing Room ( <unk> ) emergency meeting concluded that the RAF would deploy Tornado GR4s to RAF Akrotiri , Cyprus in support of refugees sheltering from Islamic State militants in the Mount Sinjar region of Iraq . The decision came three days after the United States began conducting air attacks against the Islamic State . Tornados were pre @-@ positioned to use their surveillance capabilities to gather situational awareness to help with humanitarian efforts . On 29 September 2014 , three days after Parliament approved of airstrikes against Islamic State forces inside Iraq , two Tornados conducted their first armed reconnaissance mission over the country , in conjunction with other coalition aircraft , and were cleared to conduct airstrikes if needed . Britain 's first airstrike was conducted the next day , when two Tornados hit a heavy weapons post and an armored vehicle in the process of supporting Kurdish forces in northwest Iraq . By 1 March 2015 , eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq . 
 On the 2 December 2015 , the British Parliament voted to begin air strikes in Syria as well as Iraq , to combat the growing threat of ISIS . Tornados began their bombing that evening .

 On 25 September 1985 , the UK and Saudi Arabia signed the Al Yamamah I contract including , amongst other things , the sale of 48 IDS and 24 ADV model Tornados . The first flight of a RSAF Tornado IDS was on 26 March 1986 , and the first Saudi ADV was delivered on 9 February 1989 . Saudi Tornados undertook operations during the Gulf War . In June 1993 the Al Yamamah II contract was signed , the main element of which was 48 additional IDSs . 
 Following experience with both the Tornado and the McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 15E Strike Eagle , the RSAF discontinued low @-@ level mission training in the F @-@ 15E in light of the Tornado 's superior low @-@ altitude flight performance . In addition , 10 of the Saudi Tornados were outfitted with equipment for performing reconnaissance missions . The 22 Tornado ADVs were replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon ; the retired aircraft were being purchased back by the UK as of 2007 . 
 By 2007 , both the Sea Eagle anti @-@ ship missile and the ALARM anti @-@ radiation missile that previously equipped the RSAF 's Tornados had been withdrawn from service . As of 2010 , Saudi Arabia has signed several contracts for new weapon systems to be fitted to their Tornado and Typhoon fleets , such as the short range air @-@ to @-@ air IRIS @-@ T missile , and the Brimstone and Storm Shadow cruise missiles . 
 In September 2006 , the Saudi government signed a contract worth £ 2 @.@ 5 billion ( US $ 4 @.@ 7 billion ) with BAE Systems to upgrade up to 80 RSAF Tornado IDS aircraft to keep them in service until 2020 . RSAF Tornado <unk> was returned to BAE Systems Warton in December 2006 for upgrade under the " Tornado Sustainment Programme " ( <unk> ) , which will " equip the IDS fleet with a range of new precision @-@ guided weapons and enhanced targeting equipment , in many cases common with those systems already fielded by the UK 's Tornado GR4s . " In December 2007 , the first RSAF aircraft to complete modernisation was returned to Saudi Arabia . 
 Starting from the first week of November 2009 , Saudi Air Force Tornados , along with Saudi F @-@ 15s performed air raids during the Shia insurgency in north Yemen . It was the first time since Operation Desert Storm in 1991 that the Royal Saudi Air Force participated in a military operation over hostile territory .

 Tornado GR1 
 RAF IDS variants were initially designated the Tornado GR1 with later modified aircraft designated Tornado GR1A , Tornado GR1B , Tornado GR4 and Tornado GR4A . The first of 228 GR1s was delivered on 5 June 1979 , and the type entered service in the early 1980s . A total of 142 aircraft were upgraded to GR4 standard from 1997 to 2003 . 
 Tornado GR1B 
 The Tornado GR1B was a specialised anti @-@ shipping variant of the GR1 . A total of 26 were converted , which were based at RAF Lossiemouth , Scotland , replacing the Blackburn Buccaneer . Each aircraft was equipped to carry up to four Sea Eagle anti @-@ ship missiles . At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping , instead relying on the missile 's seeker for target acquisition , later updates allowed target data to be fed from aircraft to missile . 
 Tornado GR4 
 In 1984 , the UK Ministry of Defence began studies for a GR1 Mid @-@ Life Update ( MLU ) . The update to GR4 standard , approved in 1994 , would improve capability in the medium @-@ altitude role based on lessons learned from the GR1 's performance in the 1991 Gulf War . British Aerospace ( later BAE Systems ) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard , beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003 . 59 RAF aircraft are receiving the CUSP avionics package which integrates the Paveway IV bomb and installs a new secure communications module from <unk> in Phase A , followed by the Tactical Information Exchange ( TIE ) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B. 
 Tornado GR1A / GR4A 
 The GR1A is the reconnaissance variant used by the RAF and RSAF , fitted with the TIRRS ( Tornado Infra @-@ Red Reconnaissance System ) , replacing the cannon . The RAF ordered 30 GR1As , 14 as GR1 rebuilds and 16 as new @-@ builds . When the Tornado GR1s were upgraded to become GR4s , GR1A aircraft were upgraded to GR4A standard . The switch from low @-@ level operations to medium / high @-@ level operations means that the internal TIRRS is no longer in use . As the GR4A 's internal sensors are no longer essential , the RAF 's Tactical Reconnaissance Wing operate both GR4A and GR4 aircraft . 
 = = = Tornado ECR = = = 
 Operated by Germany and Italy , the ECR is a Tornado variant devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses ( SEAD ) missions . It was first delivered on 21 May 1990 . The ECR has sensors to detect radar usage and is equipped with anti @-@ radiation AGM @-@ 88 HARM missiles . The Luftwaffe 's 35 ECRs were delivered new , while Italy received 16 converted IDSs . Italian Tornado ECRs differ from the Luftwaffe aircraft as they lack built @-@ in reconnaissance capability and use <unk> reconnaissance pods , also only Luftwaffe ECRs are equipped with RB199 <unk> engine , which has a slightly higher thrust rating . The German ECRs do not carry a cannon . The RAF uses the IDS version in the SEAD role instead of the ECR . It also modified several of its Tornado <unk> to undertake the mission . 
 = = = Tornado ADV = = = 
 The Tornado ADV ( air defence variant ) was an interceptor variant of the Tornado , developed for the RAF ( designated Tornado F2 or F3 ) and also operated by Saudi Arabia and Italy . The ADV had inferior agility to fighters like the McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 15 Eagle , but it was not intended as a dog @-@ fighter , instead it was a long @-@ endurance interceptor to counter the threat from Cold War bombers . Although the ADV had 80 % parts commonality with the Tornado IDS , the ADV had greater acceleration , improved RB199 <unk> engines , a stretched body , greater fuel capacity , the AI.24 Foxhunter radar , and software changes . It had only one cannon to accommodate a retractable inflight refuelling probe .

 = Franklin Peale = 
 Benjamin Franklin Peale ( born Aldrovand Peale ; October 15 , 1795 – May 5 , 1870 ) , usually Franklin Peale , was an employee and officer of the Philadelphia Mint from 1833 to 1854 . Although Peale introduced many innovations to the Mint of the United States , he was eventually dismissed amid allegations he had used his position for personal gain . 
 Peale was the son of painter Charles Willson Peale , and was born in the museum of curiosities that his father ran in Philadelphia . For the most part , Franklin Peale 's education was informal , though he took some classes at the University of Pennsylvania . He became adept in machine making . In 1820 , he became an assistant to his father at the museum , and managed it after Charles Peale 's death in 1827 . 
 In 1833 , Peale was hired by the Mint , and was sent for two years to Europe to study and report back on coining techniques . He returned with plans for improvement , and designed the first steam @-@ powered coinage press in the United States , installed in 1836 . Peale was made Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint that year , and Chief Coiner three years later upon the retirement of the incumbent , Adam Eckfeldt , who continued in his work without pay . Eckfeldt 's labor allowed Peale to run a medal business using Mint property . This sideline eventually caused Peale 's downfall : conflicts with Engraver James B. Longacre and Melter and Refiner Richard Sears McCulloh led to Peale being accused of misconduct , and he was dismissed by President Franklin Pierce in 1854 . 
 In retirement , Peale continued his involvement in and leadership of many civic organizations ; he died in 1870 . Numismatic author Q. David Bowers suggests that the facts of Peale 's career allow writers to draw very different conclusions about him . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Benjamin Franklin Peale was born October 15 , 1795 , to painter Charles Willson Peale and his second wife , the former Elizabeth de Peyster . As well as pursuing his art , Charles Peale ran a museum of curiosities housed in Philosophical Hall in Philadelphia , home of the American Philosophical Society . The boy was born in the family quarters in the museum . He was given the name Aldrovand , after the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi . 
 Charles Peale recorded family births on the flyleaf of a copy of Matthew Pilkington 's Dictionary of Painters , rather than in a Bible , and after recording " Aldrovand " added the notation , " if he likes that name when he comes of age " . The father was a member of the American Philosophical Society , and in February 1796 brought his young son to a meeting , and asked the members to select another name for the child . They decided on Benjamin Franklin Peale , naming the boy after the Society 's founder , Benjamin Franklin . Society legend holds that the boy was given the name while placed in the chair of the president of the Society , which had been donated by Franklin . 
 Franklin Peale was one of sixteen children his father would have by his three wives . Elizabeth Peale died when Franklin was eight years old , but his father soon remarried , and the child was thereafter cared for by his stepmother . He was given little classroom education , though he did spend some time at a local school in nearby Bucks County , as well as at Germantown Academy and the University of Pennsylvania . For the most part , his education was informal , as was usual in the Peale family , with the student given the means to study what interested him , or what he appeared to be good at . In Franklin Peale 's case , he made toys as a boy , and surveyed his father 's farm near Germantown . Although he lacked the artistic talent of some of his brothers , such as Titian Peale , he proved mechanically inclined . 
 At age 17 , Peale began to work for the Delaware cotton factory of William Young , on the Brandywine River , learning the making of machines . He was an apt student , becoming adept as a turner , founder , and draftsman . He was tolerated in his desire for a mechanical career by his father , who considered it a foolish whim . Within a year , one of the Hodgson brothers , who ran a nearby machine shop , described Peale as highly capable with tools . At age 19 Peale returned to Germantown , where , having designed and supervised the installation of the machinery for a cotton factory there , he was put in charge , and continued to manage the factory for several years . He then moved to nearby Philadelphia , and worked for the firm of John & Coleman Sellers , which made machinery for card sticking . 
 On April 24 , 1815 , Peale , still a minor at age 19 , married Eliza <unk> without his father 's consent . Almost immediately , it became evident she had mental problems . Although Eliza bore Peale a child within the first year of the marriage ( a daughter , Anna ) , she thereafter left him , returning to live with her mother , who had her committed to Pennsylvania Hospital as a " lunatic " . The Peale family began a lengthy effort to show that Eliza Peale was mad when she married Franklin , a ground for annulment . With aid from the testimony of Captain Allen McLane , they were successful , and the annulment was granted on March 22 , 1820 . Franklin Peale was required to post assets as security for the support of his former wife ; his sister Sophy lent him some of her stock in the museum for that purpose . 
 In 1820 , Peale left factory management to assist his aging father in running the museum , and remained there for over a decade . When Charles Willson Peale died in 1827 , Franklin became the manager of the museum , and like his siblings , inherited stock in it . He not only maintained the exhibits , but added to them , contributing a " curious speaking toy " as well as the model for an early locomotive , which was used to draw two small cars in the museum , with seating for four people . At the time , the museum was located in the Old State House ( today , Independence Hall ) , and Peale worked out a system for using the State House bell to inform fire companies of the location of a blaze . 
 Peale was one of the founders of The Franklin Institute in 1824 , one of several mechanics ' institutes that came into being in the early 1820s to provide working men with technical education . It quickly became important and influential , organizing an exhibition of American manufactured goods that October , one of at least 26 such shows that it put on in the first 34 years of its existence . Peale taught natural history , mechanics ( illustrating his lectures with models and drawings ) , and chemistry , livening the talks with experiments . He was for many years actively involved with The Franklin Institute , writing articles for its Journal and serving on key committees .

 The second building to house the Philadelphia Mint opened in 1833 , with up @-@ to @-@ date technology except in the coining process . For this , it used the transplanted machinery of its predecessor , using human muscle power to strike coins . Although the Mint wanted all coins to be identical to others of the same denomination , the use of the screw press was an impediment to this , as the force used to impress the design on the coins was not uniform . Additionally , the coinage dies were made by hand , leading to differences between coins struck from different dies . This state of affairs was unsatisfactory to the director , Samuel Moore , who had for several years contemplated purchasing a modern set of steam machinery for the production of coins from the Soho Mint in Birmingham , England , founded by coining pioneer Matthew Boulton . Moore instead decided to engage a new employee and send him on a special tour of European mints and refineries , in order to learn the best features of each and bring the knowledge home for use at the Philadelphia facility . The individual would be given the title of Assistant to the Assayer , Jacob R. Eckfeldt . Moore obtained the approval of Treasury Secretary Louis McLane and an appropriation of $ 7 @,@ 000 for the purpose . 
 Moore , in a letter to McLane , noted that sending an agent to Europe to gather technology had been discussed in the past , but proposals had foundered over the difficulty of finding a person both competent enough to undertake the trip successfully and not too busy to spend a year or more in Europe . At the recommendation of the director 's first cousin , Robert M. Patterson , Moore hired Peale for the position . According to Patterson , " I do not know any man more likely to succeed in such a mission . His skill , his perseverance , his address all fit him for the errand . " Peale was willing to go , writing , " a variety of circumstances render me very desirous of vacating the situation that I have held for many years as Manager of the Phila Museum , it will therefore be agreeable to change even at a pecuniary sacrifice . " 
 Peale departed from New York for Le Havre on May 8 , 1833 , arriving in Paris late in the month . At this time , it was only certain that Peale would visit Paris — a visit to England , with instruction at local mints and refineries , was still under discussion . Peale had been instructed to learn " parting , " a newly developed method for separating gold and silver . This process , also dubbed refining , is necessary because nuggets that contain gold also contain some silver , and the latter metal must be removed before the gold can be alloyed with copper for coining . The older method of removing silver involved the use of nitric and sulphuric acids , and was dangerous and expensive . Director Moore also instructed Peale to gain the method of assaying silver by the " humid process " ( titration ) , and to learn everything he could of coining technology and how it was powered by steam . Moore warned , " a very material object of your mission is to be regarded as <unk> , until you have become familiar with everything requisite for directing the formation of an establishment de novo [ from nothing ] ... and until you shall have acquired a good share of adroitness in the actual manipulations ... Whatever can be added to our information in regard to the treatment of the precious metals , and Mint processes and machinery is within the scope of your inquiries . " Moore asked that , if Peale had any time remaining , to look into other technologies that might be useful to the United States , such as the gas illumination of cities . 
 With the aid of the United States Minister to France , Edward Livingston , Peale gained permission to study closely the workings of the Monnaie de Paris . The staff there was cooperative , and Peale was able to learn the " humid " method from watching the assayer as he verified the silver content of the coins from the French branch mints . Peale 's notes were supplemented by detailed engravings of all the fixtures used in the process , published and sold by the Paris mint at an expense of 98 francs 50 centimes , which Peale deemed worth the purchase on the US government 's behalf . Peale also purchased a set of the apparatus for the humid method , made and sold by the mint ; Peale paid 500 francs for this . 
 Some of the machinery that would be installed on Peale 's return to Philadelphia was based on what he saw in Paris . He sketched the Monnaie de Paris 's <unk> model coin presses . He also copied the Paris facility 's Tour á portrait reducing lathe . He could not learn parting there as the facility contracted the process to private refineries ; attempts to gain permission to learn the process at these facilities failed when their owners demanded huge sums , believing that Peale , as a government agent , was flush with money . 
 Peale journeyed to London , hoping that Moore 's connections could get him instruction in the parting process . Although he visited the Royal Mint , he found officials there unhelpful and unwilling to teach him . In England , Peale studied the method of assaying via the humid process at Percival N. Johnson 's refinery , and in 1835 introduced it to the Philadelphia Mint , replacing assaying by <unk> . Peale wrote that he " cannot speak in too high terms of Mr. Percival Johnson ... I have derived much useful information in his refinery particularly his method of separating silver , gold and <unk> [ palladium ] by a shortened process " . While in London , Peale ordered a delicate balance scale from his friend , expatriate American Joseph Saxton , and later induced Saxton to return to the United States and work for the Philadelphia Mint . 
 Peale returned to France where , as the refiners wanted payment for teaching him the French method of parting , he learned it by observing the assayer at the branch mint in Rouen . He was not completely happy with this , as he was not allowed to practice it himself , or to experiment , but felt that he could reproduce what he had seen on his return to Philadelphia . Peale also visited the German mints of Dresden , Stuttgart , and Karlsruhe . In Germany , parting was done in iron vessels ; although Peale noted these were cheaper than platinum ones , he preferred the latter , writing in December 1834 that use of iron " sometimes leads to losses that are embarrassing . " He also visited Freiberg , in Saxony , observing the smelting and refining of lead ore . 
 = = = Return and results = = = 
 On June 17 , 1835 , Peale submitted his report to Moore , 276 pages of his observations at the various European mints he had visited , and his comments and recommendations . He warned , " in the organization of Mints in both France and England that there are offices and incumbents , that are useless , and who render no services of importance for their appointment " . He recommended favorably the French practice of not appointing a coin designer , but having competitions judged jointly by Mint officers and by artists . Peale also urged the passage of a single , comprehensive Mint Act , to replace the scattered bits of legislation passed over the years ; this was done in 1837 . One recommendation submitted by Peale , but not adopted , was to have the Mint set up a guaranty department , to hallmark items made of gold or silver by the private sector as public assurance of their quality , as done by the Goldsmiths Company in London . He also recommended that the Philadelphia Mint strike medals , as did its French counterpart . He suggested that the Mint establish a museum of coins and coining , as the Paris facility had . 
 Peale returned from Europe with plans he had drawn for a steam @-@ powered coinage press , borrowing the steam machinery design from English mints and the toggle joint technology from French ones . In September , Patterson , by then Mint Director in place of the retired Moore , wrote to Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury , " we have just completed under the superintendence of Mr. Peale , a model of a coining press from plans which he saw in successful operation in France and in Germany , and possessing many very manifest advantages over the Screw press now applied at the Mint . Among these one of the most important is that [ it ] admits the immediate and easy application of steam power . " Director Patterson called March 23 , 1836 " an epoch in our coinage " . To take advantage of the new press 's increased production capacity , Peale designed a new machine to cut planchets , or blanks , from metal strips . This machine remained in use , almost unmodified , until 1902 . 
 Another of the steam @-@ powered machines Peale had installed on his return was a milling machine , which was used to " upset " the coin — to form a rim around it . A Contamin portrait lathe was imported from France and installed at the Philadelphia Mint in 1837 . Prior to this time , all coin dies for American coins had to be made individually , by hand at Philadelphia . Once the lathe was installed , they could be reproduced mechanically by the pantograph @-@ like device . 
 The first pieces produced by steam power at the Philadelphia Mint , commemorative medals , were struck on March 23 , 1836 . The first steam press there then began minting cents , with silver and gold coinage first struck there by steam towards the end of the year . Built by the Philadelphia firm of Merrick , Agnew , and Taylor to Peale 's design , the press was able to coin 100 pieces per minute . After being retired from government service , the press was used at The Franklin Institute to strike miniature medals for many years , and in 2000 was moved to the American Numismatic Association 's Money Museum in Colorado Springs . Patterson wrote , 
 The performance of the press , in which the power of the lever is substituted for that of the screw , has answered all our expectations . Since that time , all the copper coins have been struck by this press , and it has been lately used with success for coining half dollars . The workmen are now engaged in making other steam presses ; and as these are completed , the coining by human labor be abandoned , and the work that can be executed in ... the Mint will be greatly increased . 
 Numismatist Roger Burdette notes , " in most respects , Peale seems to have selected the best from European examples , and discarded all unnecessary complexity and ineffective motion . " Although minor improvements were made from time to time , these machines struck the nation 's coinage for the remainder of Peale 's life . 
 According to numismatist David Lange , " the fact @-@ finding journey of [ future ] Philadelphia Mint Melter and Refiner Franklin Peale through the mints of Europe from 1833 to 1835 assured that United States coins would be second to none in terms of technology . " Lange , in his history of the Mint , notes that though Peale ended his career by being fired amid accusations of impropriety , upon his return from Europe , " he was the bearer of many innovations devised in the mints of Europe and now made available to the United States Mint at Philadelphia " . Robert Patterson III , son of the Mint Director under whom Peale served for many years , wrote that through Peale 's report , " our Mint was placed in full possession of all that was then worthy to be known " from foreign mints and refineries . Patterson indicated that he had often thought , as he passed through the Philadelphia Mint 's coining department , that a plaque should be set up to Peale reproducing the tribute to Sir Christopher Wren in London 's St. Paul 's Cathedral , Si Monumentum <unk> , <unk> ( if you seek his monument , look around you ) .

 Joseph Cloud had held the position of Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint since 1797 . The Washington administration appointee resigned , effective at the start of 1836 . Peale was nominated as Cloud 's replacement by President Andrew Jackson on December 21 , 1835 , and was confirmed by the Senate on January 5 , 1836 . 
 On taking office as Melter and Refiner , Peale implemented the changes he had recommended based on what he had seen in Europe . He also wanted additional mechanization in the mint 's <unk> Department , headed by Chief Coiner Adam Eckfeldt , whose son Jacob was the Philadelphia Mint 's Assayer . Adam Eckfeldt had helped strike some of the first federal coins in 1792 and had been in his office since 1814 . Eckfeldt was reluctant to adopt all Peale 's recommendations , telling Peale 's nephew , engineer George Sellers , " If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down ... he wants something better and no doubt he would have it if we were starting anew . " As improvements crept in despite Eckfeldt 's caution , the Chief Coiner saw their value and became more enthusiastic , noting the savings in working time afforded by the Contamin lathe , which had been imported from France after being seen by Peale there . To help deal with the increased output from the Philadelphia Mint , Peale invented a piling @-@ box , allowing planchets or coins to be quickly stacked , and a counting board , speeding the work of the clerks . The counting board remained in use until the mints installed mechanical counters in 1934 . 
 One of the innovations that Peale introduced as Melter and Refiner was the use of salt in parting , using it to recover the silver dissolved in nitric acid when gold bullion was being purified . Previously , this could only be done by using copper , a process that generated dangerous and offensive fumes . Table salt ( sodium chloride ) , dissolved in nitric acid , caused silver chloride to precipitate , which could be recovered as metallic silver through the use of zinc and sulfuric acid . This was a further refinement of the parting process ; the director of the Monnaie de Paris , Joseph Louis Gay @-@ Lussac , had first used a salt solution as an easy , accurate means of assaying silver . A Senate report in 1873 stated that Peale 's advancement of this process " attests to his genius , enterprise , and high attainments " . When there were calls in Congress in 1836 for a two @-@ cent piece to be made of debased silver , or billon , Patterson had Peale , working with Second Engraver Christian Gobrecht , strike pattern coins to show that the coins would be easily counterfeited using base metals . 
 In 1835 , Congress had authorized branch mints at Charlotte , North Carolina , Dahlonega , Georgia , and New Orleans , Louisiana , to strike into American coin the gold being mined in or entering the country through the South . Despite the rich gold deposits nearby , both Charlotte and Dahlonega were in areas lacking men with technical training ; accordingly trained personnel would have to be sent from Philadelphia . New buildings were to be constructed . In August 1837 , Mint Director Patterson received word of problems at both sites , including a partial collapse of the Dahlonega building . He wrote to Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury , proposing " to send , to both the Gold mints , a confidential & skillful person , who may ... give instructions as to correcting the errors , that have been committed ... I know of no one competent to this task , except our Melter & Refiner , Mr. Peale . " Woodbury agreed , informing Patterson , " you are authorized to send Mr. Peak . [ sic ] " 
 Peale , accompanied by his daughter Anna , arrived in Charlotte on September 23 , 1837 . He found that necessary equipment had not yet arrived , and without it he could do little . Peale ordered a search made , and reported to Patterson that he was " in a trap " in " this fag end of creation " in a town where " the only active beings are the hogs " . Peale spent time visiting the mines on which the Charlotte Mint would rely for bullion . He proposed to Patterson that he continue to New Orleans after Dahlonega , to which the Mint Director replied that he would " exercise my veto upon your proposed long delay " and " your presence [ in Philadelphia ] cannot be dispensed with " . On October 27 , much of the missing equipment arrived in Charlotte , and Peale was able to complete his mission there and leave for Dahlonega on November 10 . Following a difficult journey over primitive mountain roads , Franklin and Anna Peale arrived there on November 15 . After assessing the problems at the nascent Dahlonega Mint , Peale reported to Patterson , 
 The workmanship of the Mint edifice is abominable , a letter might be three times filled with the details of errors and intentional mal construction , the first and greatest of which might be traced to Philada , in ordering a brick building in a country where there is no clay , the material employed for the brick making being the red soil of the Gold region , a decomposed granite … put into brick by men who certainly deserve diplomas for <unk> . 
 Nevertheless , Peale recommended that construction on the building continue , as he deemed Congress unlikely to pass another appropriation for construction . The <unk> left Dahlonega at the end of November . On their way north , Anna was slightly injured when the train in which they were riding though Virginia derailed . Peale was back at his desk at the Philadelphia Mint on December 23 , 1837 . 
 Roger Burdette discusses the influence Peale had on the Mint in the 1830s : 
 In mid @-@ 1835 we find Philadelphia engineer / machinist Benjamin Franklin Peale discarding most of the complexity and tradition attendant to press design work of <unk> in Paris , <unk> in Karlsruhe , and Boulton in London . Peale went to basic principles of equipment used at these great mints , and adapted it to the American model of efficiency . Equipment had to be robust and easy to repair . The vast distances of North America made it impossible to have mechanical experts at each mint , sitting , waiting for something to break ... The Mint Bureau of 1839 had to insist on similar ways of processing gold and silver [ at the four mints ] , even if these processes were not the most efficient or inexpensive . As with equipment , we can again see Franklin Peale borrowing from the Royal Mint and Paris Mint such production methods that worked well , and discarding those of questionable utility in the American mints .

 = = = = Appointment and early years = = = = 
 When Adam Eckfeldt retired in 1839 , he recommended Peale as his successor . As the Senate was not sitting , Peale was given a recess appointment as Chief Coiner of the Philadelphia Mint by President Martin Van Buren on March 27 , 1839 . On January 23 , 1840 , after the Senate reconvened , Van Buren nominated Peale ; the Senate gave its approval on February 17 . Despite his retirement , Eckfeldt continued to come to the mint every day until shortly before his death in February 1852 , performing the function of Chief Coiner and leaving Peale with time on his hands . 
 Soon after his appointment , Peale began to engage in a private business on the Mint 's premises . He did this by designing , striking and selling medals for private commission , using government property and labor , and the Philadelphia Mint 's facilities . Peale 's enterprise was very profitable , as his expenses were minimal . This activity took place with the knowledge of the other officers of the Philadelphia Mint , most of whom were Peale 's friends and relatives . Clients included corporations as well as one couple celebrating a 50th wedding anniversary . According to Robert E. Wright in his history of Philadelphia as an early financial center , the legality of Peale 's business was unclear , but " the uncertainty of the situation made it almost inevitable that someone would make a stink on [ Philadelphia 's ] Chestnut Street . " 
 This activity has been variously characterized by numismatic writers . According to coin dealer and numismatic author Q. David Bowers , " Peale started to abuse his position and privileges , in effect stealing services from the government " . Burdette notes , " Overall , it appears that Peale used mint equipment and employees to make medals as instructed by Congress and the mint director , and to produce copies from private and official dies for sale to anyone who was interested . In the case of private sales , Peale seems to have used government metal , then reimbursed the bullion accounts when he collected for the medal . Profits were not accounted for in mint ledgers and it is unknown how much went to Peale , others at the mint or into the mint 's Cabinet of Coins . The total amount was probably not large . " 
 After <unk> Saxton left the Mint Service in 1844 , much of the work of maintaining and modifying the sensitive balances for which Saxton was responsible fell to Peale . The Chief Coiner made a number of improvements to the scales , which he wrote up for an article in the Journal of The Franklin Institute in 1847 . These balances , sensitive to .0001 troy ounces ( 0 @.@ <unk> oz ; 0 @.@ 0031 g ) , were protected by plate glass from air currents and dust . 
 = = = = Conflict with Longacre = = = = 
 In 1844 , Engraver Gobrecht died , and was replaced by James B. Longacre . The new incumbent had obtained his appointment through the influence of South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun . He had no relationship to the families that dominated the Philadelphia Mint , such as the <unk> and <unk> , and the connection with the Southerner Calhoun was objectionable to Peale , Patterson , and their associates . They would have preferred no replacement for Gobrecht , with the New York engraver Charles Cushing White or others they knew and trusted brought in on contract as necessary . This would ensure Peale 's highly profitable medal business was not threatened . Additionally , Longacre had no training , prior to his appointment , in coin or medal design , being a successful plate engraver , and Lange states that the Mint officers were " understandably " prejudiced against him . 
 Peale sometimes worked on medals for the government , taking care to exclude Longacre from the process . During the Mexican @-@ American War , Congress voted a gold medal to Major General Zachary Taylor for his victories at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma . Peale engraved the design from a portrait by William Carl Brown and a model by John T. Battin . After Taylor became president , Peale designed his Indian Peace Medal ; Peale also engraved Indian Peace Medals for presidents John Tyler and James Polk , working from designs or models by other men . In 1846 , Peale designed and engraved the Coast Survey Medal ( also called the George M. Bache medal ) . Peale believed that all national commemorative medals , those authorized by Congress , should have their dies lodged at the Philadelphia Mint , and be struck there , and with Patterson 's support urged the issuance of medals for presidents for whom no Indian Peace Medal had been designed , such as John Adams and William Henry Harrison . This was done , but not in Peale 's time — for example , the William Henry Harrison medal was designed by later Assistant and Chief Engraver George T. Morgan . These works , like Peale 's Indian Peace Medals , form part of the Mint 's Presidential series , which continues to the present day . 
 Peale 's improvements had made it possible for dies to be reproduced mechanically , relieving the Mint 's Engraver of much of his routine duties . In the absence of a need for new designs or denominations , Longacre had little to do but add the dates to dies . Some of these insertions were blundered , and modern @-@ day numismatic scholars , such as R. W. Julian , have wondered if , as Peale and those who worked under him also sometimes inserted dates into dies , these mistakes were done intentionally in an attempt to bring discredit on Longacre . Nevertheless , Longacre 's first few years at the Philadelphia Mint passed without serious conflict with Peale . All this changed in 1849 , when Congress authorized a gold dollar and a double eagle ( $ 20 piece ) . This made Longacre the center of attention at the mint , as he would be responsible for producing the new designs and dies . It also brought him into direct conflict with Peale : the Engraver would need to use the Contamin lathe , which was necessary to Peale 's medal business . Peale sought to sabotage Longacre 's attempts , with the goal of having him dismissed , and such work contracted for outside the government , allowing the medal business to continue undisturbed . In this , Peale had the support of Director Patterson . 
 As Longacre worked to complete the two new coins , he had to deal with interference from Peale . In early 1849 , according to a letter written by Longacre the following year , the Engraver was approached by a member of the Mint staff , warning him that another officer ( plainly Peale ) sought to have the engraving work done outside the Mint , making Longacre redundant . Longacre 's response to the information was to spend much of March 1849 preparing the dies for the gold dollar , at some cost to his health , as he later related . Longacre proceeded with work on the double eagle through late 1849 , and described the obstacles set in his path by Peale : 
 The plan of operation selected for me was to have an electrotype mould made from my model , in copper , to serve as a pattern for a cast in iron . The operations of the galvanic battery for this purpose were conducted in the apartments of the chief coiner . The galvanic process failed , my model was destroyed in the operation . I had , however , taken the precaution to make a cast in plaster ... From this cast , as the only alternative , I <unk> [ sic ] a metallic one which , however , was not perfect ; but I thought I should be able to correct the imperfections in the engraving of the die ... this was a laborious task , but seasonably completed , entirely by my own hand . The die then had to be hardened in the coining department ; it unluckily split in the process . 
 According to numismatic historian Don Taxay , " under the circumstances , Peale 's adoption of a process not normally used at the Mint , together with its catastrophic failure , seems more than coincidental . " When Longacre completed the double eagle dies , they were rejected by Peale , who stated that the design was engraved too deeply to fully impress the coin , and the pieces would not stack properly . Taxay , however , noted that the one surviving 1849 double eagle displays no such problems , and by appearance would be level in a stack . Peale complained to Patterson , who wrote to Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith asking for Longacre 's removal on December 25 , 1849 , on the ground he could not make proper dies . Meredith was apparently willing to have Longacre fired , but relented after the Engraver journeyed to Washington and met with him personally . 
 Beginning in 1849 , there were calls for a silver three @-@ cent piece , and pattern coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint . Longacre 's design featured a shield within a six @-@ pointed star on one side . Peale offered a competing design , showing a Liberty cap , very similar to one Gobrecht had made in 1836 when a gold dollar had been proposed . Patterson preferred Peale 's design , but reluctantly endorsed Longacre 's , since it was in lower relief and could be struck more easily , and Treasury Secretary Thomas Corwin approved the Engraver 's work . The three @-@ cent piece went into circulation in 1851 . 
 In 1850 , with the Mint faced with a vast increase in gold deposits due to the California Gold Rush , Peale suggested that the Mint hire women to supplement the staff assigned to weigh and adjust gold planchets , or coin blanks , describing the work as " being entirely suited to their capacity " . The Mint did hire 40 women , who were ( as of 1860 ) paid $ 1 @.@ 10 per ten @-@ hour day , a sum considered generous . The Mint 's hiring of women was the first time the American government had employed women to fill specific jobs at regular wages . 
 In 1851 , Peale designed a new steam engine for the Philadelphia Mint , using a " steeple " design without exterior pipes . Although designed to generate 100 horsepower , wear soon reduced its capacity . American journals of engineering mentioned Peale 's latest work without comment ; British journals pointed out the defects and suggested that time had passed Peale by . 
 = = = = Downfall = = = = 
 Not all of Peale 's innovations were successful . He caused the Mint to purchase a large lathe for turning heavy metal rolls , which cost the government at least $ 2 @,@ 000 and that Peale conceded had never worked and likely never would . He bought from his nephew , George Sellers , a set of molds for casting ingots and accompanying equipment , which proved unusable as they were not adapted to the Mint 's machinery . A <unk> made by Peale at the cost of at least $ 1 @,@ 500 proved dangerous as the piston would drive with tremendous force against the end of its cylinder , causing a concussion and endangering those nearby . " Peale 's machine gun " was put aside by Mint staff as useless soon after its introduction . An 1853 attempt by Peale to convert the Philadelphia Mint 's wood @-@ burning annealing furnaces to use anthracite coal destroyed the furnaces , cost the government several thousand dollars , and led to Peale being ordered to undertake no more such projects . One invention that worked well was the " noisy sofa " — sitting on it set off a trumpet blast . Constructed at the cost of about $ 200 in government funds , it graced in turn the offices of Peale and Patterson . 
 These activities were financed through a provision of the Mint Act of 1837 that Patterson interpreted to allow the Mint to decline to give credit for small amounts of silver in gold deposits . This practice was twice approved by the then @-@ Secretary of the Treasury , in 1837 and 1849 . Small deposits of bullion were rounded down to be divisible by $ 5 , with the surplus kept and used at the discretion of Mint officials . This , and similar practices whereby officials financed activities without an appropriation from Congress , were brought to an end after Peale proposed a $ 20 @,@ 800 renovation of part of the Philadelphia Mint building in 1850 , and ran over budget by $ 12 @,@ 000 . To pay this , Patterson used the profits , or seignorage , projected to be made from the new three @-@ cent pieces . When Congress heard of this , it passed the Act of February 21 , 1853 , requiring the Mint Director to regularly pay the seignorage into the Treasury . 
 One flaw in Peale 's medal business was his need to acquire gold and silver bullion within the Mint . This was paid for once the medal sold , and there was no problem while the Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint was Peale 's friend Jonas R. McClintock . But in 1846 , McClintock resigned and was replaced by Richard Sears McCulloh . At first , McCulloh gave Peale whatever gold and silver he needed without question , but came to object to doing so . Peale and McCulloh made a deal whereby the struck medal would remain in McCulloh 's custody until Peale had replaced the bullion , but Peale objected that the procedure was " inconvenient " . Beginning in August 1849 , McCulloh refused further requests from Peale for bullion , and Peale instead gained it from the Mint 's Treasurer . 
 Peale did his best to make McCulloh 's position difficult , such as refusing to accept bullion for coins except from McCulloh personally . In 1850 , McCulloh resigned . In November of that year , the former official published an article in the New York Evening Express alleging that those employed at the Mint had transformed " it into a workshop for their gain " . President Millard Fillmore sent the article to Secretary of the Treasury Corwin for an explanation ; Corwin forwarded it to Patterson , who confirmed that Peale was running a private medal business on the premises , but stated that there was no interference with the performance of Peale 's duties as Chief Coiner . Taxay noted that this was only true because the retired Adam Eckfeldt was still performing the duties of that office without salary , and this ceased in February 1852 when Eckfeldt died after a brief illness . The death of his predecessor caused Peale to write " a frantic letter " to the new Mint Director ( Patterson had retired ) , George N. Eckert , stating that he urgently needed an assistant . 
 McCulloh 's campaign had continued ; on August 1 , 1851 , he wrote directly to President Fillmore , accusing Peale of " lavish and unnecessary expenditure of public money " , and stating that Peale was unfit to hold office . He alleged that Mint workmen had been detailed to make repairs to Peale 's house while being paid for their time by the government . One man subsequently stated that he and another Mint employee spent two days working on Peale 's house ; another alleged that whenever the archery club of which Peale was a member met , Mint employees were sent to help with the arrangements . McCulloh also accused Peale of having Mint workers make furniture for his use when they would otherwise be idle . Corwin ordered an investigation , which dragged on for the next year and a half . Peale entered a statement in April 1852 , alleging that McCulloh was accusing the Director and the accounting staff of " gross neglect of duty " , and that McCulloh 's attack on Peale 's medal business was a slight on " the late venerable and much loved Adam Eckfeldt " , whose precedent Peale stated he was following . Peale wrote in his defense , " I boldly claim to have done for the Mint and my country , much that will entitle me gratitude . " 
 Eckert was friendly towards Peale , and worked to discredit the accusations . McCulloh urged Corwin to review the correspondence himself , and the Secretary agreed , but both Corwin and Eckert left office in early 1853 with no action having been taken against Peale . McCulloh that summer published a pamphlet , The Proceedings of the Late Director of the Mint in Relation to the Official Misconduct of Franklin Peale Esq . , Chief Coiner and Other Abuses in the Mint , printing much of the correspondence . This tract was reviewed by the new Mint Director , James Ross Snowden ; he and the new Treasury Secretary , James Guthrie , decided to forbid private enterprises on the Mint 's property . In August 1854 , Guthrie issued regulations banning the practice . 
 Taxay recorded that the new policy " seem [ s ] to have been ill @-@ received in certain quarters of the Mint " but that as not all records are extant , the specifics are uncertain . According to Taxay , 
 It is clear , however , that Snowden wrote to Guthrie preferring charges against Peale , and that Guthrie in turn wrote to the President [ Franklin Pierce ] who , having no one else to write to , dismissed Peale at once ... Peale left the Mint on December 2 , [ 1854 , ] never again to return . 
 The reasons for Peale 's firing were not publicly announced , and his friends and allies , such as William DuBois ( Adam Eckfeldt 's son @-@ in @-@ law and the Assistant Assayer ( later Assayer ) of the Philadelphia Mint ) stated that it was so President Pierce could have the position to fill from the Democratic Party . Taxay noted that this explanation ignored the fact that Martin Van Buren , under whose administration Peale had been appointed Chief Coiner , was also a Democrat as president . Nevertheless , an 1873 Senate report on Peale 's request for compensation after being dismissed stated , " why such a valuable officer was displaced does not appear " . 
 = = Later years , death , and assessment = = 
 After his departure from the Philadelphia Mint , Peale initially retired from all employment . In 1864 , he returned to the private sector as president of the Hazelton Coal and Rail Road Company , in which he had long been involved , remaining in that position through 1867 . Civic organizations of which he was president included the Musical Fund Society of Pennsylvania and the Institution for Instruction to the Blind . He had been elected a manager of the latter organization in 1839 , served on many important committees , and was elected its president in 1863 , still holding the office at his death in 1870 . A member of the American Philosophical Society since 1833 , he served as one of its curators from 1838 to 1845 and from 1847 until 1870 . A longtime member of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts , which his father had helped to found , he served as one of its directors through much of his retirement . He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1865 . 
 In his later years , Peale spent some of his autumns at the Delaware Water Gap north of Philadelphia , searching for Stone Age artifacts and amassing a major collection . Peale catalogued his finds and added narrative descriptions , bequeathing the collection to the American Philosophical Society . An adept archer , he helped found the United Bowmen club , members of whom carried his casket to his grave , at his instructions . He was also , at his death , president of the Skater 's Club . He was a lifelong skater , and developed a method for extracting a skater who broke through the ice that saved many lives . 
 Peale was among those consulted in 1870 by Treasury Secretary George Boutwell in preparing the legislation to reform the Mint that became the Coinage Act of 1873 . Peale advocated for the office of the Mint Director to be moved from Philadelphia to Washington ; this was enacted . He supported the abolition of the gold dollar and the three @-@ dollar piece , but these coins were not ended by Congress until 1890 . He denigrated recent coin issues ( many designed by Longacre , who had died in 1869 ) , saying that their designs have , " hitherto been lamentably , if not disgracefully deficient " . 
 Peale married twice ; his first marriage to Eliza <unk> , contracted in 1815 while he was still a minor , produced one daughter , Anna , who survived him . His second , childless , marriage was to Caroline Girard Haslam , a widow , and the niece of the wealthy Stephen Girard ; it lasted from 1839 to his death . He enjoyed the company of children , making toys by his own hand for them . Peale was in declining health in his final months , but was still able to continue his activities , and only a short illness preceded his death at his home at 1131 Girard Street in Philadelphia , on May 5 , 1870 . His final words were , " If this is death , it is as I wished , perfect peace , perfect comfort , perfect joy . " 
 Mint Director Henry Linderman stated in 1873 of Peale , " Although Mr. Peale undoubtedly received the cooperation of [ Patterson and others ] , the inventions and improvements were peculiarly Mr. Peale 's . I have no doubt whatever on that point . They were of almost incalculable value to the public service . " George G. Evans , in his late 19th century history of the Mint , described Peale , " his mildness , integrity , gentlemanly bearing and high moral and mental culture constituted him a model officer " . Walter Breen deemed Peale , " brilliant but unscrupulous " . Burdette writes of Peale and his effect on the Mint , " during the generation from about 1830 to 1855 , the greatest influence to operations and production came from one man : Benjamin Franklin Peale . He was the consummate ' machinist ' of the day at a time when this term encompassed imaginative design , planning , construction and improvement of working processes ... While he had the complete support of mint directors Moore and Patterson , he was also held in high esteem by the common mint workers and Philadelphia 's scientific elite . Results of many of his ideas lasted a century or more , until growth in population made nineteenth century engineering insufficient for modern coinage needs . " According to Bowers , " today Peale is one of several Mint people who can be viewed from many different angles , each perspective sometimes leading certain writers to draw widely differing conclusions . " 
 After his dismissal , Peale petitioned Congress for $ 30 @,@ 000 as payment for improvements and inventions he had made for the government . The Senate twice , in 1858 and 1860 , passed legislation to pay Peale $ 10 @,@ 000 , but the House of Representatives declined to vote on it . In 1870 , it was introduced in the Senate again , but did not pass . Legislation to compensate Peale in the amount of $ 10 @,@ 000 was enacted on March 3 , 1873 , after his death — the act was , according to its title , in relief of Anna E. Peale , Franklin Peale 's daughter . The following month , Caroline Peale , Franklin 's widow , gave the Mint a marble bust of her late husband , " to be set upon a pedestal , in some position , where it may be open to the inspection of visitors and preserve his memory to future generations . " Taxay , writing in 1966 , stated that he had been unable to ascertain the bust 's whereabouts . 
 = Jocko Thompson = 
 John Samuel " Jocko " Thompson ( January 17 , 1917 – February 3 , 1988 ) was a professional baseball pitcher . He played all or part of four seasons for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball from 1948 to 1951 . He also served in the Army of the United States as a first lieutenant in the European theater during World War II . Thompson played in Major League Baseball during the Whiz Kids era during a career which spanned 12 seasons ( 1940 – 1941 , 1946 – 1955 ) . After attending Northeastern University , Thompson appeared as a situational pitcher and spot starter during the 1948 , 1949 , and 1950 seasons with the Phillies , and went 4 – 8 in his only season as a regular member of the team 's starting rotation . After demotion to the minors in 1952 , Thompson retired from baseball after the 1955 season . 
 Before his major league career , Thompson entered the military and participated in Operation Market Garden , where he led a platoon to secure a bridge over the Maas River . He served in the Army from 1941 to 1945 . In 2004 , the bridge that his platoon captured was renamed in his honor .

 Described as a " fast ball specialist " , Thompson played three seasons for the baseball team at Northeastern University , one of six Major League Baseball players to attend the school . During his tenure ( 1938 – 1940 ) , the Huskies won 31 games and lost 14 , accumulating a <unk> winning percentage . After the 1940 college season , Thompson was signed by Major League Baseball 's Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent . The Red Sox assigned Thompson to their D @-@ level affiliate , the Centreville Red Sox , where he posted an 18 – 5 record and a 1 @.@ 56 earned run average ( ERA ) in 27 games . He also played in seven games for the Canton Terriers , winning one and losing one and compiling a 3 @.@ 41 ERA . Under manager Heinie <unk> , Thompson played for the Greensboro Red Sox in the Piedmont League during the 1941 season ; he amassed an 8 – 13 record and a 3 @.@ 56 ERA in 162 innings pitched . 
 = = Military service = = 
 Thompson entered the Army of the United States in 1941 and was assigned to the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment , a part of the 82nd Airborne Division . In 1944 , as a first lieutenant , Thompson led his men during an air raid as part of Operation Market Garden . The light in the jump bay of the platoon 's C @-@ 47 Skytrain was later than expected , moving their landing zone from its intended location near Grave , Netherlands ; the plane was passing over buildings when the paratroopers were signalled to leave the aircraft , and Thompson decided to wait until reaching several approaching fields . 
 Thompson led his platoon in an attack against the nearby bridge spanning the Maas River , which was defended by German forces supplemented by two 20 mm flak guns , one on the close side of the bridge and one across the river . The platoon opened fire on the German forces , killing four . Two trucks of German soldiers arrived on the scene , but they " showed no desire to fight ... [ and ] ran away " . Thompson 's platoon destroyed " electrical equipment and cables that they expected were hooked up to demolitions " , and their bazooka operator destroyed the nearer flak gun , permitting the establishment of a roadblock on the bridge while waiting for the remainder of the 82nd Airborne . After the battle at the Maas bridge , Thompson also participated in the Battle of the Bulge , where he was given a field commission , and during the Allied occupation of Berlin , where he served as an aide to General James M. Gavin . 
 Thompson was wounded twice during the war , for which he received two Purple Hearts ; fellow pitcher Robin Roberts later wrote that his Phillies teammates " understood that Jocko still carried around a considerable amount of shrapnel in his body " . Other decorations included the Bronze Star with cluster , the Silver Star , and various awards from the Belgian , French , and Dutch governments .

 Thompson returned to baseball with the Scranton Red Sox of the Eastern League for the 1946 season . He was second on the team in innings pitched ( 180 ) and finished with a 13 – 7 record in 26 games ( 20 starts ) . For the season , Thompson allowed 164 hits — the most on the team — and 97 walks . The following year , he was promoted to the Toronto Maple Leafs , one of Boston 's two Triple @-@ A @-@ level affiliates . After he posted a 6 – 12 record — the team 's worst mark among starters with 30 or more appearances — the Red Sox did not retain Thompson 's rights when their working agreement with the Maple Leafs ended . He remained with Toronto and his rights became the property of the Philadelphia Phillies when those two teams established a new agreement . 
 In 1948 , Thompson went 12 – 8 for the Maple Leafs , the second @-@ best win – loss record among the team 's regular starting pitchers ( 20 or more starts ) .

 Mangalore ( / <unk> / ) , officially known as Mangaluru , is the chief port city of the Indian state of Karnataka . It is known as <unk> in Tulu , Mangaluru in Kannada , <unk> in Konkani , <unk> in Beary . It is located about 352 kilometres ( 220 mi ) west of the state capital , Bangalore between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghat mountain ranges . It is the administrative headquarters of the Dakshina Kannada ( formerly South Canara ) district in south western Karnataka . 
 It developed as a port on the Arabian Sea — remaining , to this day , a major port of India . Lying on the backwaters of the Netravati and Gurupura rivers , Mangalore is often used as a staging point for sea traffic along the Malabar Coast . The city has a tropical climate and lies in the path of the Arabian Sea branch of the South @-@ West monsoons . Mangalore 's port handles 75 per cent of India 's coffee and cashew exports . Mangalore was ruled by several major powers , including the Kadambas , Alupas , Vijayanagar Empire , Keladi Nayaks and the Portuguese . The city was a source of contention between the British and the Mysore rulers , Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan . Eventually annexed by the British in 1799 , Mangalore remained part of the Madras Presidency until India 's independence in 1947 . The city was unified with the state of Mysore ( now called Karnataka ) in 1956 . 
 Mangalore is demographically diverse with several languages , including Tulu , Konkani , Kannada , English , Urdu and Beary commonly spoken , and is the largest city in Dakshina Kannada district . Mangalore is one of the most cosmopolitan non @-@ metro cities of India . It is also the largest city in the Coastal and Malnad regions of Karnataka , besides being a leading commercial , industrial , educational and healthcare hub on the West Coast . Mangalore city urban agglomeration extends from Ullal in the south to <unk> in the north , covering a distance of over 40 km . The city 's landscape is characterised by rolling hills , coconut palms , freshwater streams and hard red @-@ clay tiled @-@ roof buildings . 
 Mangalore ranks amongst the cleanest cities in India . The city was ranked India 's 13th and Karnataka 's second most favourable destination for business . Mangalore was selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi 's flagship Smart Cities Mission . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Mangalore was named after the Hindu deity Mangaladevi , the presiding deity of the Mangaladevi temple or a synonym of Tara <unk> of the Vajrayana Buddhist sect . According to local legend , a princess from Malabar named <unk> or <unk> renounced her kingdom and became a disciple of Matsyendranath , the founder of the Nath tradition . Having converted <unk> to the Nath sect , Matsyendranath renamed her Mangaladevi . She arrived in the area with Matsyendranath , but had to settle near Bolar in Mangalore as she fell ill on the way . Eventually she died , and the Mangaladevi temple was consecrated in her honour at Bolar by the local people after her death . The city got its name from the temple . 
 One of the earliest references to the city 's name was made in 715 CE by the Pandyan King <unk> , who called the city <unk> . The city and the coastal region was a part of the Pandyan Kingdom . According to K.V. Ramesh , President of the Place Names Society of India , Mangaluru was first heard in 1345 CE during the Vijayanagar rule . Many <unk> ( stones ) of Vijayanagar period refer the city as <unk> . Even before that , during the Alupas period , it was referred to as <unk> ( ' Mangala ' means ' auspicious ' ) . The city is well known as Mangaluru in Kannada , a reference to Mangaladevi ( the suffix <unk> means town or city ) . During the British occupation from 1799 , Mangalore ( anglicised from Mangaluru ) , stuck as the official appellation . However , according to historian George M. Moraes , the word " Mangalore " is the Portuguese corruption of Mangaluru . The name of this town also appears in maps as early as the 1652 Sanson Map of India . 
 Mangalore 's diverse communities have different names for the city in their languages . In Tulu , the primary spoken language , the city is called <unk> , meaning " junction " , since the city is situated at the confluence of the Netravati and Gurupura rivers . In Konkani , Mangalore is referred to as <unk> , while the Beary name for the city is <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 Mangalore 's historical importance is highlighted by the many references to the city by foreign travellers . During the first century CE , Pliny the Elder , a Roman historian , made references to a place called Nitrias , as a very undesirable place for disembarkation , on account of the pirates which frequent its vicinity , while Greek historian Ptolemy in the second century CE referred to a place called Nitra . Ptolemy 's and Pliny the Elder 's references were probably made to the Netravati River , which flows through Mangalore . Cosmas Indicopleustes , a Greek monk , in his 6th century work Christian Topography mentions Malabar as the chief seat of the pepper trade , and <unk> ( port of Mangalore ) as one of the five pepper <unk> which exported pepper . 
 Mangalore is the heart of a distinct <unk> — cultural region : Tulu Nadu , the homeland of the Tulu @-@ speaking people , which was nearly coterminous with the modern district of South Canara . In the third century BCE , the town formed part of the Maurya Empire , ruled by the Buddhist emperor , Ashoka of Magadha . From the third century CE to sixth century CE , the Kadamba dynasty , whose capital was based in Banavasi in North Canara , ruled over the entire Canara region as independent rulers . From the middle of the seventh century to the end of the 14th century , the South Canara region was ruled by its own native Alupa rulers . The Alupas ruled over the region as feudatories of major regional dynasties like the Chalukyas of Badami , Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta , Chalukyas of Kalyani , and Hoysalas of <unk> . During the reign of the Alupa king Kavi <unk> ( c . 1110 – <unk> ) , the city was visited by the Tunisian Jewish merchant Abraham Ben <unk> , who travelled between the Middle East and India during the 12th century . The Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta , who had visited the town in 1342 , referred to it as <unk> , and stated that the town was situated on a large estuary , called the " estuary of the wolf , " and was the greatest estuary in the country of Malabar . By 1345 , the Vijayanagara rulers brought the region under their control . During the Vijayanagara period ( 1345 – 1550 ) , South Canara was divided into Mangalore and Barkur <unk> ( provinces ) , and two governors were appointed to look after each of them from Mangalore and Barkur . But many times only one governor ruled over both Mangalore and Barkur <unk> , and when the authority passed into the hands of Keladi rulers ( c . 1550 – 1763 ) , they had a governor at Barkur alone . In 1448 , Abdur Razzaq , the Persian ambassador of Sultan Shah Rukh of Samarkand , visited Mangalore , en route to the Vijayanagara court . The Italian traveller , Ludovico di <unk> , who visited India in 1506 says that he witnessed nearly sixty ships laden with rice ready for sail in the port of Mangalore . 
 European influence in Mangalore can be traced back to 1498 , when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at St Mary 's Island near Mangalore . In the 16th century , the Portuguese came to acquire substantial commercial interests in Canara . Krishnadevaraya ( 1509 – 1529 ) , the then ruler of the Vijaynagara empire maintained friendly relations with the Portuguese . The Portuguese trade was gradually gathering momentum and they were striving to destroy the Arab and <unk> trade along the coast . In 1524 , when Vasco da Gama heard that the Muslim merchants of Calicut had agents at Mangalore and Basrur , he ordered the rivers to be blockaded . In 1526 , the Portuguese under the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio took possession of Mangalore . The coastal trade passed out of Muslim hands into Portuguese hands . In 1550 , the Vijayanagara ruler , Sadashiva Raya , entrusted the work of administering the coastal region of Canara to <unk> Nayaka of Keladi . By 1554 , he was able to establish political authority over South Canara . The disintegration of the Vijaynagara Empire in 1565 gave the rulers of Keladi greater power in dealing with the coastal Canara region . They continued the Vijayanagara administrative system . The two provinces of Mangalore and Barkur continued to exist . The Governor of Mangalore also acted as the Governor of the Keladi army in his province . In 1695 , the town was torched by Arabs in retaliation to Portuguese restrictions on Arab trade . 
 Hyder Ali , the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore , conquered Mangalore in 1763 , consequently bringing the city under his administration until 1767 . Mangalore was ruled by the British East India Company from 1767 to 1783 , but was subsequently wrested from their control in 1783 by Hyder Ali 's son , Tipu Sultan ; who renamed it Jalalabad . The Second Anglo – Mysore War ended with the Treaty of Mangalore , signed between Tipu Sultan and the British East India Company on 11 March 1784 . After the defeat of Tipu at the Fourth Anglo – Mysore War , the city remained in control of the British , <unk> the Canara district under the Madras Presidency . 
 According to the Scottish physician Francis Buchanan who visited Mangalore in 1801 , Mangalore was a rich and prosperous port with flourishing trading activity . Rice was the grand article of export , and was exported to Muscat , Bombay , Goa and Malabar . <unk> or Betel @-@ nut was exported to Bombay , Surat and Kutch . Pepper and Sandalwood were exported to Bombay . Turmeric was exported to Muscat , Kutch , Surat and Bombay , along with Cassia Cinnamon , Sugar , Iron , <unk> , Ginger , <unk> and Timber . 
 The British colonial government did not support industrialisation in the region , and local capital remained invested mostly in land and money lending , which led to the later development of banking in the region . With the arrival of European missionaries in the early 19th century , the region saw the development of educational institutions and a modern industrial base , modelled on European industries . The opening of the Lutheran Swiss Basel Mission in 1834 was central to the industrialisation process . Printing press , cloth @-@ weaving mills and tile factories manufacturing the famed Mangalore tiles were set up by the missionaries . When Canara ( part of the Madras Presidency until this time ) was bifurcated into North Canara and South Canara in 1859 , Mangalore was transferred into South Canara and became its headquarters . South Canara remained under Madras Presidency , while North Canara was detached from Madras Presidency and transferred to Bombay Presidency in 1862 . The enactment of the Madras Town Improvement Act ( 1865 ) mandated the establishment of the Municipal council on 23 May 1866 , which was responsible for urban planning and providing civic amenities . The Italian Jesuits , who arrived in Mangalore in 1878 , played an important role in education , economy , health , and social welfare of the city . The linking of Mangalore in 1907 to the Southern Railway , and the subsequent proliferation of motor vehicles in India , further increased trade and communication between the city and the rest of the country . By the early 20th century , Mangalore had become a major supplier of educated manpower to Bombay , Bangalore , and the Middle East . 
 As a result of the States Reorganisation Act ( 1956 ) , Mangalore ( part of the Madras Presidency until this time ) was incorporated into the dominion of the newly created Mysore State ( now called Karnataka ) . Mangalore is the sixth largest city of Karnataka , and ninth largest port of India , providing the state with access to the Arabian Sea coastline . Mangalore experienced significant growth in the decades 1970 – 80 , with the opening of New Mangalore Port in 1974 and commissioning of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited in 1976 . Today , the Mangalore region is a nationally known higher education hub with a flourishing service sector , particularly in medical services , a small but growing IT regional hub , and a booming real estate and banking industry .

 = Hoopoe starling = 
 The hoopoe starling , also known as the Réunion starling or Bourbon crested starling ( Fregilupus varius ) , is a species of starling which lived on the Mascarene island of Réunion , and became extinct in the 1850s . Its closest relatives were the Rodrigues starling and the Mauritius starling from nearby islands , and the three apparently originated in Southeast Asia . The bird was first mentioned during the 17th century and was long thought to be related to the hoopoe , from which its name is derived . Although a number of affinities have been proposed , it was confirmed as a starling in a DNA study . 
 The hoopoe starling was 30 cm ( 12 in ) in length . Its plumage was primarily white and grey , with its back , wings and tail a darker brown and grey . It had a light , mobile crest , which curled forwards . The bird is thought to have been sexually dimorphic , with males larger and having more curved beaks . The juveniles were more brown than the adults . Little is known about hoopoe starling behaviour . Reportedly living in large flocks , it inhabited humid areas and marshes . The hoopoe starling was omnivorous , feeding on plant matter and insects . Its pelvis was robust , its feet and claws large , and its jaws strong , indicating that it foraged near the ground . 
 The birds were hunted by settlers on Réunion , who also kept them as cagebirds . Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world . The hoopoe starling was reported to be in decline by the early 19th century , and was probably extinct before the 1860s . A number of factors have been proposed , including competition and predation by introduced species , disease , deforestation and persecution by humans , who hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first account thought to mention the hoopoe starling is a 1658 list of birds of Madagascar written by French governor Étienne de Flacourt . Although he mentioned a black @-@ and @-@ grey " <unk> " or hoopoe , later authors have wondered whether this referred to the hoopoe starling or the Madagascan subspecies of hoopoe ( Upupa epops marginata ) , though that bird resembles the Eurasian subspecies . The hoopoe starling was first noted on the Mascarene island of Réunion ( then called " Bourbon " ) by Père <unk> in 1669 , but was not described in detail until Sieur Dubois 's 1674 account : 
 Hoopoes or ' <unk> ' , having a white tuft on the head , the rest of the plumage white and grey , the bill and the feet like a bird of prey ; they are a little larger than the young pigeons . This is another good game [ i.e. , to eat ] when it is fat . 
 Early settlers on Réunion referred to the bird as " <unk> " , due to the similarity of its crest and curved bill with that of the hoopoe . Little was recorded about the hoopoe starling during the next 100 years , but specimens began to be brought to Europe during the 18th century . Although the species was first scientifically described by French naturalist Philippe Guéneau de Montbeillard in the 1779 edition of Comte de Buffon 's Histoire Naturelle , it did not receive its scientific name until its designation by Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert for the book 's 1783 edition . Boddaert named the bird Upupa varia ; its genus name is that of the hoopoe , and its specific name means " variegated " , describing its black @-@ and @-@ white colour . Boddaert provided Linnean binomial names for plates in Buffon 's works , so the accompanying 1770s plate of the hoopoe starling by François @-@ Nicolas Martinet is considered the holotype or type illustration . Though the plate may have been based on a specimen in the National Museum of Natural History in Paris , this is impossible to determine today ; the Paris museum originally had five hoopoe starling skins , some which only arrived during the 19th century . The possibly female specimen MNHN 2000 @-@ 756 , one of the most @-@ illustrated skins , has an artificially trimmed crest resulting in an unnaturally semi @-@ circular shape , unlike its appearance in life ; the type illustration has a similarly shaped crest . 
 De Flacourt 's " <unk> " led early writers to believe that variants of the bird were found on Madagascar and the Cape of Africa ; they were thought to be <unk> of the Upupa genus , which received names such as Upupa capensis and Upupa madagascariensis . A number of authors also allied the bird with groups such as birds @-@ of @-@ paradise , bee @-@ eaters , cowbirds , <unk> , and choughs , resulting in its reassignment to other genera with new names , such as <unk> cristata and Pastor <unk> . In 1831 , René @-@ Primevère Lesson placed the bird in its own monotypic genus , <unk> , a composite of Upupa and Fregilus , the latter a defunct genus name of the chough . Auguste Vinson established in 1868 that the bird was restricted to the island of Réunion and proposed a new binomial , Fregilupus borbonicus , referring to the former name of the island . 
 Hermann Schlegel first proposed in 1857 that the species belonged to the starling family ( Sturnidae ) , reclassifying it as part of the Sturnus genus S. capensis . This reclassification was observed by other authors ; Carl Jakob Sundevall proposed the new genus name <unk> ( " crested starling " ) in 1872 , yet Fregilupus varius — the oldest name — remains the bird 's binomial , and all other scientific names are synonyms . In 1874 , after a detailed analysis of the only known skeleton ( held at the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology ) , James Murie agreed that it was a starling . Richard Bowdler Sharpe said in 1890 that the hoopoe starling was similar to the starling genus <unk> , but did not note any similarities other than their crests . In 1941 , Malcolm R. Miller found the bird 's musculature similar to that of the common starling ( Sturnus vulgaris ) after he dissected a specimen preserved in spirits at the Cambridge Museum , but noted that the tissue was very degraded and the similarity did not necessarily confirm a relationship with starlings . In 1957 , Andrew John Berger cast doubt on the bird 's affinity with starlings due to subtle anatomical differences , after dissecting a spirit specimen at the American Museum of Natural History . Some authors proposed a relationship with <unk> ( <unk> ) , but Hiroyuki Morioka rejected this in 1996 , after a comparative study of skulls . 
 In 1875 , British ornithologist Alfred Newton attempted to identify a black @-@ and @-@ white bird mentioned in an 18th @-@ century manuscript describing a marooned sailor 's stay on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues in 1726 – 27 , hypothesising that it was related to the hoopoe starling . Subfossil bones later found on Rodrigues were correlated with the bird in the manuscript ; in 1879 , these bones became the basis for a new species , Necropsar rodericanus ( the Rodrigues starling ) , named by ornithologists Albert Günther and Edward Newton . Although they found the Rodrigues bird closely related to the hoopoe starling , Günther and Newton kept it in a separate genus due to " present ornithological practice " . American ornithologist James Greenway suggested in 1967 that the Rodrigues starling belonged in the same genus as the hoopoe starling , due to their close similarity . Subfossils found in 1974 confirmed that the Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling ; primarily , its stouter bill warrants generic separation from Fregilupus . In 2014 , British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species , the Mauritius starling ( <unk> <unk> ) , based on subfossils from Mauritius , which was closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling in its skull , sternal , and humeral features . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 In 1943 , Dean Amadon suggested that Sturnus @-@ like species could have arrived in Africa and given rise to the wattled starling ( <unk> cinerea ) and the Mascarene starlings . According to Amadon , the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings — such as some Sturnus species — rather than to the glossy starlings ( <unk> ) of Africa and the Madagascan starling ( <unk> aurata ) , based on their colouration . A 2008 study analysing the DNA of a variety of starlings confirmed that the hoopoe starling belonged in a clade of Southeast Asian starlings as an isolated lineage , with no close relatives . The following cladogram shows its position : 
 An earlier attempt by another team could not extract viable hoopoe starling DNA . The authors of the successful study suggested that ancestors of the hoopoe starling reached Réunion from Southeast Asia by using island chains as " stepping stones " across the Indian Ocean , a scenario also suggested for other Mascarene birds . Its lineage diverged from that of other starlings four million years ago ( about two million years before Réunion emerged from the sea ) , so it may have first evolved on landmasses now partially submerged . 
 Extant relations , such as the Bali myna ( <unk> rothschildi ) and the white @-@ headed starling ( <unk> <unk> ) , have similarities in colouration and other features with the extinct Mascarene species . Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling — which appears closer to Southeast Asian starlings — there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from Asia to the Mascarenes , with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival . Except for Madagascar , the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean with native starlings , probably due to their isolation , varied topography , and vegetation . 
 = = Description = = 
 The hoopoe starling was 30 cm ( 12 in ) in length . The bird 's culmen was 41 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) long , its wing 147 mm ( 5 @.@ 8 in ) , its tail 114 mm ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) , and its tarsus about 39 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) long . It was the largest of the three Mascarene starlings . A presumed adult male ( NHMUK 1889 @.@ 5 @.@ 30 @.@ 15 ) in the Paris museum has a light ash @-@ grey head and back of the neck ( lighter on the hind @-@ neck ) , with a long crest the same colour with white shafts . Its back and tail are ash @-@ brown , its wings darker with a greyish wash , and its uppertail covert feathers and rump have a rufous wash . Its primary coverts are white with brown tips , although the bases ( instead of the tips ) are brown in other specimens . The superciliary stripe , lore , and most of the specimen 's underside is white , with a pale rufous wash on the flanks and undertail coverts . The extent of light rufous on the underside varies by specimen . The beak and legs are lemon @-@ yellow , with yellow @-@ brown claws . It has a bare , triangular area of skin around the eye , which may have been yellow in life . Though the species ' iris was described as bluish @-@ brown , it has been depicted as brown , yellow or orange . 
 There has been confusion about which characteristics that were sexually dimorphic in the species . Only three specimens were sexed ( all males ) , with age and individual variation not considered . The male is thought to have been largest with a longer , curvier beak . In 1911 , Réunion resident Eugène Jacob de <unk> recalled his observations of the bird about 50 years before , suggesting that only males had a white crest , but this is thought to be incorrect . A presumed female ( MNHN 2000 @-@ 756 ) in the Paris museum appears to have a smaller crest , a smaller and less @-@ curved beak , and smaller primary coverts . A juvenile specimen has a smaller crest and primary coverts , with a brown wash instead of ash grey on the crest , lore , and superciliary stripe , and a light @-@ brown ( instead of ash @-@ brown ) back . The juveniles of some southeast Asian starlings are also browner than adults . 
 Vinson , who observed live hoopoe starlings when he lived on Réunion , described the crest as flexible , disunited and forward @-@ curled barbs of various lengths , highest in the centre , and able to be erected at will . He compared the bird 's crest to that of a cockatoo and to the tail feathers of a bird @-@ of @-@ paradise . Most mounted specimens have an erect crest , indicating its natural position . The only illustration of the hoopoe starling now thought to have been made from life was drawn by Paul Philippe <unk> de Jossigny during the early 1770s . Jossigny instructed engravers under the drawing that for accuracy , they should depict the crest angled forward from the head ( not straight up ) . Hume believes that Martinet did this when he made the type illustration , and it was derivative of Jossigny 's image rather than a life drawing . Jossigny also made the only known life drawing of the now @-@ extinct Newton 's parakeet ( Psittacula exsul ) after a specimen sent to him from Rodrigues to Mauritius , so this is perhaps also where he drew the hoopoe starling . Murie suggested that only the illustrations by Martinet and Jacques <unk> were " original " , since he was unaware of Jossigny 's drawing , but noted a crudeness and stiffness in them which made neither appear lifelike . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 Little is known about the behaviour of the hoopoe starling . According to François Levaillant 's 1807 account of the bird ( which included observations from a Réunion resident ) it was abundant , with large flocks inhabiting humid areas and marshes . In 1831 , Lesson , without explanation , described its habits as similar to those of a crow . Vinson 's 1877 account relates his experiences with the bird more than 50 years earlier : 
 Now these daughters of the wood , when they were numerous , flew in flocks and went thus in the rain forests , while deviating little from one another , as good companions or as nymphs taking a bath : they lived on berries , seeds and insects , and the <unk> , disgusted by the latter fact , held them for an impure game . Sometimes , coming from the woods to the littoral [ coast ] , always flying and leaping from tree to tree , branch to branch , they often alighted in swarms on coffee trees in bloom , and there was in the past the testimony of an inhabitant of the Island of Bourbon , said the naturalist Levaillant , that they caused big damage in coffee trees by making the flowers fall prematurely . But it is not the white flowers of coffee that the <unk> were searching for and thus behaving so , it was for the caterpillars and insects that devoured them ; and in this they made an important service to the silviculture of the Island of Bourbon and the rich coffee plantations , with which this land was then covered , the golden age of the country ! 
 Like most other starlings , the hoopoe starling was omnivorous , feeding on fruits , seeds , and insects . Its tongue — long , slender , sharp , and frayed — may have been able to move rapidly , helpful when feeding on fruit , nectar , pollen , and invertebrates . Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large , indicating that it foraged near the ground . Its jaws were strong ; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe , and it may have foraged in a similar way , probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak . De Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen , consisting of seeds and the berries of " <unk> " ( possibly Eugenia buxifolia , a bush with sweet , orange berries ) . He noted that the bird weighed 4 ounces ( 110 g ) , and was fatter around June and July . Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on Réunion , spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains . Food may have been easier to obtain in the lowlands during winter , with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer . The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities . Its song was described as a " bright and cheerful whistle " and " clear notes " , indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings . 
 Many other endemic species on Réunion became extinct after the arrival of humans and the resulting disruption of the island 's ecosystem . The Mascarene parrot lived with other now @-@ extinct birds , such as the Réunion ibis , the Mascarene parrot , the Réunion parakeet , the Réunion swamphen , the Réunion owl , the Réunion night heron , and the Réunion pink pigeon . Extinct Réunion reptiles include the Réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink . The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Réunion and Mauritius before vanishing from both islands . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 The hoopoe starling was described as tame and easily hunted . In 1704 , Jean Feuilley explained how the birds were caught by humans and cats : 
 Hoopoes and <unk> [ Hypsipetes borbonicus ] are the same fatness as those in France , and are of a marvellous taste , which are fat at the same time as parrots , living on the same foods . In order to catch them , hunting was done with staffs or long thin poles from six to seven feet in length , though this hunt is infrequently seen . The <unk> [ escaped ] cats destroy many . These birds allow themselves to be approached very closely , so the cats take them without leaving their places . 
 The hoopoe starling was kept as a cagebird on Réunion and Mauritius , and although the bird was becoming scarcer , a number of specimens were obtained during the early 19th century . It is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from the Mascarenes . <unk> recalled that captive birds could be fed a wide variety of food , such as bananas , potatoes , and <unk> , and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas . Many individuals survived on Mauritius after escaping there , and it was thought that a feral population could be established . However , the Mauritian population lasted less than a decade ; the final specimen on the island ( the last definite record of a live specimen anywhere ) was taken in 1836 . Specimens could still be collected on Réunion during the 1830s and , possibly , the early 1840s . 
 There are 19 surviving hoopoe starling specimens in museums around the world ( including one skeleton and two specimens preserved in spirit ) , two in the Paris museum and four in Troyes . Additional skins in Turin , Livorno , and Caen were destroyed during World War II , and four skins have disappeared from Réunion and Mauritius ( which now have one each ) . Specimens were sent to Europe beginning in the second half of the 18th century , with most collected during the first half of the 19th century . It is unclear when each specimen was acquired , and specimens were frequently moved between collections . It is also unclear which specimens were the basis for which descriptions and illustrations . The only known subfossil hoopoe starling specimen is a femur , discovered in 1993 in a Réunion grotto . 
 = = = Extinction = = = 
 Several causes for the decline and sudden disappearance of the hoopoe starling have been proposed , all connected to the activities of humans on Réunion , who it survived alongside for two centuries . An oft @-@ repeated suggestion is that the introduction of the common myna ( Acridotheres tristis ) led to competition between these two starling species . The myna was introduced to Réunion in 1759 to combat locusts , and became a pest itself . However , the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100 years and they may not have shared habitat . The black rat ( Rattus rattus ) arrived on Reunion in the 1670s , and the brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) in 1735 , multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species . Like the hoopoe starling , the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs , juveniles , and nesting birds . During the mid @-@ 19th century the Réunion slit @-@ eared skink ( <unk> borbonicus ) became extinct due to predation by the introduced wolf snake ( <unk> aulicum ) , which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source . Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds , a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds . According to ecologist Anthony S. Cheke , this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling 's extinction ; the species had survived for generations despite other threats . 
 Beginning in the 1830s , Réunion was deforested for plantations . Former slaves joined white peasants in cultivating pristine areas after slavery was abolished in 1848 , and the hoopoe starling was pushed to the edges of its former habitat . According to Hume , over @-@ hunting was the final blow to the species ; with forests more accessible , hunting by the rapidly growing human population may have driven the remaining birds to extinction . In 1821 , a law mandating the extermination of grain @-@ damaging birds was implemented , and the hoopoe starling had a reputation for damaging crops . During the 1860s , various writers noted that the bird had almost disappeared , but it was probably already extinct by this time ; in 1877 , Vinson lamented that the last individuals might have been killed by recent forest fires . No attempts to preserve the species in captivity seem to have been made . The hoopoe starling survived longer than many other extinct Mascarene species , and was the last of the Mascarene starling species to become extinct . The Rodrigues and Mauritius species probably disappeared with the arrival of rats ; at least five species of <unk> starlings have disappeared from the Pacific Islands , with rats contributing to their extinction . The hoopoe starling may have survived longer due to Réunion 's rugged topography and highlands , where it spent much of the year .

 Delaware Route 279 ( DE 279 ) is a 1 @.@ 05 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 69 km ) long state highway located in northern New Castle County , Delaware . It runs from the Maryland state line southwest of Newark , where it continues as Maryland Route 279 ( MD 279 ) , northeast to DE 4 and DE 896 in Newark . DE 279 follows a four @-@ lane divided highway called Elkton Road and serves as part of the route connecting Elkton , Maryland with Newark . The roadway is maintained by the Delaware Department of Transportation ( DelDOT ) . DE 279 was originally the westernmost portion of DE 2 , designated in the 1930s . This portion of road was widened into a divided highway in 1972 . In 2013 , DE 2 was truncated from the Maryland border to east of Newark to <unk> the route designations through Newark , resulting in DE 279 being designated to its current alignment .

 DE 279 begins at the Maryland border southwest of Newark . The road continues southwest into that state as MD 279 , which heads towards Elkton . From the state line , the route heads northeast on Elkton Road , a four @-@ lane divided highway . DE 279 heads through commercial areas of Newark , where it comes to an intersection with Otts Chapel Road ( Road 397 ) . The road continues past more commercial development and comes to an intersection with the western terminus of DE 4 and DE 896 ( Christiana Parkway ) . Here , DE 279 ends and Elkton Road continues northeast as part of DE 896 towards downtown Newark . The entire length of the route is located in New Castle County . The route passes through flat to gently rolling terrain at an elevation of about 100 feet ( 30 m ) . 
 DE 279 has an annual average daily traffic count of 33 @,@ 231 vehicles west of Otts Chapel Road and 31 @,@ 069 vehicles east of Otts Chapel Road . The entire length of DE 279 is part of the National Highway System .

 What is now DE 279 was originally an unimproved county road by 1920 . By 1924 , the road was paved . In 1925 , suggestions were made for the state to take over maintenance of the highway connecting the Maryland border to Newark . In 1927 , the state took over maintenance of the highway between the Maryland border and Newark . When Delaware designated its state highways by 1936 , the current alignment of DE 279 was designated as the westernmost part of DE 2 , which ran from the Maryland border through Newark east to Wilmington . The portion of DE 2 along Elkton Road between the Maryland border and Newark was widened into a divided highway in 1972 . In 2013 , DelDOT proposed the renumbering of routes in and around Newark , which involved truncating DE 2 from the Maryland border to the eastern edge of Newark and the removal of DE 2 Bus. through downtown Newark . As a result of these changes , the portion of Elkton Road between the Maryland border and the Christiana Parkway was to be designated as DE 279 . The goal of the project was to " simplify the route designations in Newark , reduce sign clutter , and reduce sign maintenance costs . " The changes were completed in summer 2013 .

 = Something ( Beatles song ) = 
 " Something " is a song by the Beatles , written by George Harrison and released on the band 's 1969 album Abbey Road . It was also issued on a double A @-@ sided single with another track from the album , " Come Together " . " Something " was the first Harrison composition to appear as a Beatles A @-@ side , and the only song written by him to top the US charts before the band 's break @-@ up in April 1970 . The single was also one of the first Beatles singles to contain tracks already available on an LP album . 
 The song drew high praise from the band 's primary songwriters , John Lennon and Paul McCartney ; Lennon stated that " Something " was the best song on Abbey Road , while McCartney considered it the best song Harrison had written . As well as critical acclaim , the single achieved commercial success , topping the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and making the top five in the United Kingdom . The song has been covered by over 150 artists , making it the second @-@ most covered Beatles song after " Yesterday " . Artists who have covered the song include Phish , Elvis Presley , Frank Sinatra , Ray Charles , James Brown , Shirley Bassey , Tony Bennett , Andy Williams , Smokey Robinson , Ike & Tina Turner , Eric Clapton , Joe Cocker , Isaac Hayes , Julio Iglesias and Neil Diamond . Harrison said his favourite version of the song was James Brown 's , which he kept in his personal jukebox . 
 = = Background and inspiration = = 
 George Harrison began writing " Something " in September 1968 , during a session for the Beatles ' self @-@ titled double album , commonly known as " the White Album " . In his autobiography , I , Me Mine , he recalls working on the melody on a piano , while Paul McCartney carried out overdubs in a neighbouring studio at London 's Abbey Road Studios . Harrison put the composition " on ice " at first , believing that with the tune having come to him so easily , it might have been the melody from another song . In I , Me , Mine , he adds that the middle eight for " Something " " took some time to sort out " . 
 The song 's opening lyric was taken from the title of " Something in the Way She Moves " , a track by Harrison 's fellow Apple Records artist James Taylor . While musically Harrison imagined the composition in the style of Ray Charles , his inspiration for " Something " was his wife , Pattie Boyd . In her 2007 autobiography , Wonderful Today , Boyd recalls : " He told me , in a matter @-@ of @-@ fact way , that he had written it for me . I thought it was beautiful ... " Boyd discusses the song 's subsequent popularity among other recording artists and concludes : " My favourite [ version ] was the one by George Harrison , which he played to me in the kitchen at Kinfauns . " 
 Having begun to write love songs that were directed at both God and a woman , with his White Album track " Long , Long , Long " , Harrison later cited alternative sources for his inspiration for " Something " . In early 1969 , according to author Joshua Greene , Harrison told his friends from the Hare Krishna Movement that the song was about the Hindu deity Krishna ; in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 1976 , he said of his approach to writing love songs : " all love is part of a universal love . When you love a woman , it 's the God in her that you see . " By 1996 , Harrison had denied writing " Something " for Boyd , adding that " everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie " because of the promotional film accompanying the release of the Beatles ' recording , which showed each member of the band with his respective wife . 
 = = Composition = = 
 In the version issued on the Beatles ' 1969 album Abbey Road , which was the first release for the song , " Something " runs at a speed of around 66 beats per minute and is in common time throughout . It begins with a five @-@ note guitar figure , which functions as the song 's chorus , since it is repeated before each of the verses and also closes the track . The melody is in the key of C major until the eight @-@ measure @-@ long bridge , or middle eight , which is in the key of A major . Harrison biographer Simon Leng identifies " harmonic interest ... [ in ] almost every line " of the song , as the melody follows a series of descending half @-@ steps from the tonic over the verses , a structure that is then mirrored in the new key , through the middle eight . The melody returns to C major for the guitar solo , the third verse , and the outro . 
 While Leng considers that , lyrically and musically , " Something " reflects " doubt and striving to attain an uncertain goal " , author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd . Referring to lines in the song 's verses , Inglis writes : " there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love ; he muses that [ Boyd ] ' attracts me like no other lover ' and ' all I have to do is think of her , ' but he is equally aware that she feels the same , that ' somewhere in her smile , she knows . ' " Similarly , when Harrison sings in the middle eight that " You 're asking me will my love grow / I don 't know , I don 't know " , Inglis interprets the words as " not an indication of uncertainty , but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater " . Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes " Something " as " an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song " written at a time " when most of the Beatles ' songs were dealing with non @-@ romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love " .

 Harrison first introduced " Something " at a Beatles session on 19 September 1968 , when he played it to George Martin 's stand @-@ in as producer of The Beatles , Chris Thomas , while the latter was working out the harpsichord part for Harrison 's track " Piggies " . Despite Thomas 's enthusiasm for the new composition , Harrison chose to focus on " Piggies " . He told Thomas that he intended to offer " Something " to singer Jackie Lomax , whose debut album Harrison was producing for Apple Records . " Something " was not among the tracks released on Lomax 's album , however , much of which was recorded in Los Angeles following the completion of the White Album . 
 After Harrison rejoined the Beatles in January 1969 for their Get Back film project ( later released as Let It Be ) , " Something " was one of many recent compositions that he offered to the group . Leng describes this period as a prolific one for Harrison as a songwriter , comparing it with John Lennon 's peak of creativity over 1963 – 64 , yet Harrison 's songs received little interest from Lennon and McCartney amid the tense , uncooperative atmosphere within the band . Martin was also unimpressed by " Something " at first , considering it " too weak and derivative " , according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore . 
 The Beatles rehearsed the song at Apple Studio on 28 January . With the proceedings being recorded by director Michael Lindsay @-@ Hogg for the planned documentary film , tapes reveal Harrison discussing his unfinished lyrics for " Something " with Lennon and McCartney , since he had been unable to complete the song 's second line , which begins " <unk> me ... " To serve as a temporary filler , Lennon suggested " like a cauliflower " , which Harrison then altered to " like a pomegranate " . In their study of the available tapes , Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that the Beatles gave the song two run @-@ throughs that day , which was the only occasion that they attempted it during the Get Back / Let It Be project . 
 = = = Harrison solo demo = = = 
 Following the Beatles ' brief efforts with " Something " on 28 January , Harrison talked with Lennon and Yoko Ono about recording a solo album of his unused songs , since he had already stockpiled enough compositions " for the next ten years " , given his usual allocation of two tracks per album , and in order to " preserve this , the Beatle bit , more " . Lennon offered his support for the idea , similarly keen that his and Ono 's recording projects outside the Beatles could continue without jeopardising the band 's future . On 25 February 1969 – his 26th birthday – Harrison entered Abbey Road Studios and taped solo demos of " Something " , " Old Brown Shoe " and " All Things Must Pass " , the last two of which had also been rejected recently by Lennon and McCartney . 
 With Ken Scott serving as his engineer , he recorded a live take of " Something " , featuring just electric guitar and vocal . By this point , Harrison had completed the lyrics , although he included an extra verse , sung to a counter @-@ melody , over the section that would comprise his guitar solo on the Beatles ' subsequent official recording . This demo version of " Something " remained unreleased until its inclusion on the Beatles ' outtake collection Anthology 3 in 1996 . 
 = = = Joe Cocker demo = = = 
 In March 1969 , Harrison gave " Something " to Joe Cocker to record , having decided that it was more likely to become a hit with Cocker than with Lomax . Referring to this and similar examples where Harrison placed his overlooked songs with other recording artists , Ken Scott has refuted the idea that he lacked confidence as a songwriter in the Beatles , saying : " I think he was totally confident about the songs . The insecurity may have been , if the Beatles kept going , ' How many songs am I going to be able to get on each album ? ' , and with the backlog sort of mounting up ... [ to ] get it out there , and get something from it . " 
 Assisted by Harrison , Cocker recorded a demo of the song at Apple . While musicologist Walter Everett suggests that this was the same recording of " Something " that appeared on the Joe Cocker ! album in November 1969 , Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes that Cocker subsequently remade the track . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 The Beatles undertook the recording of Abbey Road with a sense of discipline and cooperation that had largely been absent while making the White Album and Let It Be . Having temporarily left the group in January 1969 partly as a result of McCartney 's criticism of his musicianship , Harrison exhibited a greater level of assertiveness regarding his place in the band , particularly while they worked on his compositions " Something " and " Here Comes the Sun " . In addition , like Lennon and McCartney , Martin had come to fully appreciate Harrison as a songwriter , later saying : " I first recognised that he really had a great talent when we did ' Here Comes the Sun . ' But when he brought in ' Something , ' it was something else ... It was a tremendous work – and so simple . " 
 The group recorded " Something " on 16 April before Harrison decided to redo the song , a new basic track for which was then completed at Abbey Road on 2 May . The line @-@ up was Harrison on Leslie @-@ effected rhythm guitar , Lennon on piano , McCartney on bass , Ringo Starr on drums , and guest musician Billy Preston playing Hammond organ . On 5 May , at Olympic Sound Studios , McCartney re @-@ recorded his bass part and Harrison added lead guitar . At this point , the song ran to eight minutes , due to the inclusion of an extended coda led by Lennon 's piano . 
 After taking a break from recording , the band returned to " Something " on 11 July , when Harrison overdubbed what would turn out to be a temporary vocal . With the resulting reduction mix , much of the coda , along with almost all of Lennon 's playing on the main part of the song , was cut from the recording . The piano can be heard only in the middle eight , specifically during the descending run that follows each pair of " I don 't know " vocal lines . Lennon later reprised the piano chords from the discarded coda in his 1970 song " Remember " . On 16 July , Harrison recorded a new vocal , with McCartney overdubbing his harmony vocal over the middle eight and Starr adding both a second hi @-@ hat part and a cymbal . 
 Following another reduction mix , at which point the remainder of the coda was excised from the track , Martin @-@ arranged string orchestration was overdubbed on 15 August , as Harrison , working in the adjacent studio at Abbey Road , re @-@ recorded his lead guitar part live . Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002 , David Fricke described the Beatles ' version of " Something " as " actually two moods in one : the pillowy yearning of the verses ... and the golden thunder of the bridge , the latter driven by Ringo Starr 's military flourish on a high @-@ hat cymbal " . Leng highlights Harrison 's guitar solo on the recording as " a performance that is widely regarded as one of the great guitar solos " , and one in which Harrison incorporates the <unk> associated with Indian classical music , following his study of the sitar in 1965 – 68 , while also foreshadowing the expressive style he would adopt on slide guitar as a solo artist . 
 = = Release = = 
 Apple Records issued Abbey Road on 26 September 1969 , with " Something " sequenced as the second track , following Lennon 's " Come Together " . Lennon considered " Something " to be the best song on the album ; having ensured that " Old Brown Shoe " was chosen as the B @-@ side for the Beatles ' single " The Ballad of John and Yoko " , according to his later recollection , Lennon now pushed Allen Klein to release " Something " as a single from Abbey Road . Coupled with " Come Together " , the double A @-@ side single was issued on 6 October in America ( as Apple 2654 ) and 31 October in Britain ( as Apple <unk> ) . 
 The release marked the first time that a Harrison composition had been afforded A @-@ side treatment on a Beatles single , as well as the only time during their career that a single was issued in the UK featuring tracks already available on an album . In a 1990 letter to Mark Lewisohn , Klein refuted a claim made by Lewisohn in his book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions , that the single was intended as a money @-@ making exercise ; Klein said it was purely a mark of Lennon 's regard for " Something " and " to point out George as a writer , and give him courage to go in and do his own LP . Which he did . " Following the Beatles ' break @-@ up in April 1970 , Harrison 's ascendancy as a songwriter would continue with his triple album All Things Must Pass , building on the promise of White Album tracks such as " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " and his two contributions to Abbey Road .

 Although its commercial impact was lessened by the ongoing success of the parent album , " Something " / " Come Together " was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) on 27 October . During the single 's chart run on Billboard in the US , " Something " peaked at number 3 until the magazine changed its practice of counting sales and airplay separately for each song ; following this change on 29 November , the single topped the Billboard Hot 100 , for one week . " Something " / " Come Together " thereby became the Beatles ' eighteenth number 1 single in the US , surpassing Elvis Presley 's record of seventeen . 
 As the preferred side , " Something " was number 1 in Canada ( for five weeks ) , Australia ( five weeks ) , West Germany ( two weeks ) , New Zealand and Singapore . In the other US national charts , Record World listed " Something " / " Come Together " at number 1 , while in Cash Box magazine , which continued to rank each song separately , " Something " peaked at number 2 and " Come Together " spent three weeks at number 1 . The combined sides reached number 4 in Britain . There , the release was highly unusual , given the traditional preference for non @-@ album singles ; in addition , according to former Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer , " so enormous were sales of Abbey Road that demand for the single was inevitably dampened . " 
 On 17 February 1999 , " Something " was certified double Platinum by the RIAA . In its 2014 list titled " The Beatles ' 50 Biggest Billboard Hits " , Billboard places the double A @-@ side single in sixth place , immediately after " Let It Be " and ahead of " Hello , Goodbye " . Additionally , " Something " is placed again at number 30 , representing the song 's performance before the November 1969 Hot 100 rule change .

 The promotional video for " Something " was shot shortly after Lennon had privately announced that he was leaving the band .

The film was directed by Neil Aspinall . 
 The promo film is included in the Beatles ' 2015 video compilation 1 .

 Among contemporary reviews , Time magazine declared " Something " to be the best track on Abbey Road , while John Mendelsohn wrote in Rolling Stone : " George 's vocal , containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before , is one of many highlights on his ' Something , ' some of the others being more excellent drum work , a dead catchy guitar line , perfectly subdued strings , and an unusually nice melody . Both his and Joe Cocker 's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it . " Writing in Saturday Review magazine , Ellen Sander described " Something " as " certainly one of the most beautiful songs George Harrison has ever written " and added : " He feels his way through the song , instinctively cutting through its body and into the core , emoting so clearly and so gracefully that at the moment he peals ' I don 't know , I don 't know , ' it is shown that even what is not known can be understood . " In his review of the single , Derek Johnson of the NME lauded the track as " a real quality hunk of pop " with a " strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality " . Johnson stated his regret that Harrison " isn 't featured more regularly as a singer " , and concluded of " Something " : " It 's a song that grows on you , and mark my words , it will – in a big way ! " 
 Writing in his book Revolution in the Head , critic and author Ian MacDonald described " Something " as " the acme of Harrison 's achievement as a writer " . MacDonald highlighted the song 's " key @-@ structure of classical grace and panoramic effect " , and cited the lyrics to verse two as " its author 's finest lines – at once deeper and more elegant than almost anything his colleagues ever wrote " . 
 Like Lennon , both McCartney and Starr held the song in high regard . In the 2000 book The Beatles Anthology , Starr paired " Something " with " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " as " Two of the finest love songs ever written " , adding , " they 're really on a par with what John and Paul or anyone else of that time wrote " ; McCartney said it was " George 's greatest track – with ' Here Comes the Sun ' and ' While My Guitar Gently Weeps ' " . Among Harrison 's other peers , Paul Simon described " Something " as a " masterpiece " and Elton John said : " ' Something ' is probably one of the best love songs ever , ever , ever written ... It 's better than ' Yesterday , ' much better ... It 's like the song I 've been chasing for the last thirty @-@ five years . " 
 In a 2002 article for The Morning News , Kenneth Womack included Harrison 's guitar solo on the track among his " Ten Great Beatles Moments " . Describing the instrumental break as " the song 's greatest lyrical feature – even more lyrical , interestingly enough , than the lyrics themselves " , Womack concluded : " A masterpiece in simplicity , Harrison 's solo reaches toward the sublime , wrestles with it in a bouquet of downward syncopation , and hoists it yet again in a moment of supreme grace . " Guitar World included the performance as the magazine 's featured solo in June 2011 . Later that year , " Something " was one of the two " key tracks " highlighted by Rolling Stone when the magazine placed Harrison at number 11 on its list of the " 100 Greatest Guitarists " . 
 In July 1970 , " Something " received the Ivor Novello Award for " Best Song Musically and Lyrically " of 1969 . In 2005 , the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) named it as the 64th @-@ greatest song ever . According to the BBC , the song " shows more clearly than any other song in The Beatles ' canon that there were three great songwriters in the band rather than just two " . The Beatles ' official website states that " Something " " underlined the ascendance of George Harrison as a major songwriting force " . 
 With more than 150 versions , " Something " is the second most covered Beatles song after " Yesterday " . In 1999 , Broadcast Music Incorporated ( BMI ) named " Something " as the 17th @-@ most performed song of the twentieth century , with 5 million performances . In 2004 , the track was ranked at number 278 on Rolling Stone 's list of " The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " .

The single also reached the top twenty in other European countries and peaked at number 6 on Billboard 's Easy Listening ( later Adult Contemporary ) chart . 
 Although she had been unaware of the song 's origins when recording " Something " , Bassey later suggested that she and Harrison could become a singer @-@ and @-@ songwriter pairing on the scale of Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach . After reading these comments in 1970 , Harrison wrote " When Every Song Is Sung " with Bassey in mind , although it was not a composition that she ever recorded .

 Frank Sinatra was particularly impressed with " Something " , calling it " the greatest love song of the past 50 years " . According to Du Noyer , he " especially admired the way the lyric evokes a girl who isn 't even present " . Aside from performing " Something " numerous times in concert , Sinatra recorded the song twice : in October 1970 as a single for Reprise Records ( a version that later appeared on Frank Sinatra 's Greatest Hits , Vol . 2 ) , and for his 1980 triple album Trilogy : Past Present Future . With the sides flipped to favour the B @-@ side , " Bein ' Green " , the 1970 single peaked at number 22 on Billboard 's Easy Listening chart . 
 During his live performances , Sinatra was known to mistakenly introduce " Something " as a Lennon – McCartney composition . By 1978 , however , he had begun correctly citing Harrison as its author . Harrison went on to adopt Sinatra 's minor lyrical change ( in the song 's middle eight , singing " You stick around , Jack ... " ) in his live performances over 1991 – 92 . In The Beatles Anthology , Harrison says he viewed Sinatra as being part of " the generation before me " and so only later came to appreciate the American singer 's adoption of the song .

 Harrison 's composition began accumulating cover versions almost immediately after the release of Abbey Road . In addition to Joe Cocker , Peggy Lee and Tony Bennett each issued recordings of the song at the end of 1969 . Lena Horne recorded " Something " in the jazz style for her 1970 album with guitarist Gabor Szabo , titled Lena & Gabor . An instrumental version by Booker T. & the M.G.

Other artists who released covers of the song that year include Della Reese , Perry Como , Duane Eddy , the Ray Conniff Singers , Jerry Butler , Johnny Mathis , Engelbert Humperdinck , Isaac Hayes , King Curtis , Martha Reeves & the Vandellas and the Shadows . Ray Charles issued his version on the album Volcanic Action of My Soul in 1971 , the same year that recordings appeared by Andy Williams and Junior Walker & the All Stars , while Buddy Rich , Blue Mink and Ike & Tina Turner were among the acts who covered it in 1972 . Referring to the song 's popularity among easy @-@ listening artists , Harrison later said : " When even Liberace covered it [ in 1970 ] , you know that it 's one of them that ends up in an elevator ... " 
 " Something " was one of the rare Beatles songs that Elvis Presley chose to play , when he introduced it into the setlist for his third season at the International Hotel in Las Vegas , in August 1970 . He also performed it on his 1973 Aloha from Hawaii TV special , the recording from which appeared on the accompanying bestselling album . A live version from the 1970 Las Vegas concerts subsequently appeared on the Presley box sets Walk a Mile in My Shoes : The Essential ' 70s Masters ( 1995 ) and Live in Las Vegas ( 2001 ) . 
 Other versions of " Something " include recordings by James Brown , Peggy Lee , Willie Nelson , Smokey Robinson , Julio Iglesias and Musiq Soulchild . Harrison referred to James Brown 's recording as his favourite cover of the song , saying : " It was one of his B sides . I have it on my jukebox at home . It 's absolutely brilliant . " 
 Ray Stevens covered the song in 1970 in addition to covering another Beatles composition , She Came In Through the Bathroom Window , both on the same LP , Everything Is Beautiful . A version by country singer Johnny Rodriguez reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in the spring of 1974 . Barbara Mandrell covered the song on her 1974 album This Time I Almost Made It . Norwegian country music singer Teddy Nelson covered it for his 1989 top @-@ selling album American Dreamer , one of his few ventures into rock music . In 1999 , Power Metal band Helloween released a single of covers titled Lay All Your Love on Me in which they remade " Something " in the heavy metal style . English actor @-@ singer Jimmy Nail performed " Something " on ukulele , an instrument that Harrison championed from the 1980s onwards , as honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society . Nail 's recording on his 2001 album 10 Great Songs and an OK Voice eschewed the ukulele backing for a brass band arrangement , however . In 2013 Nancy Sinatra covered " Something " on her album Shifting Gears .

 In honour of Harrison 's fondness for the instrument , Paul McCartney played a ukulele rendition of " Something " throughout his 2002 – 03 world tour and included the track on his Back in the U.S. live album . At the Concert for George , held at London 's Royal Albert Hall on 29 November 2002 , he and Eric Clapton performed a version that begins with McCartney alone , on ukulele , and then reverts to the familiar , rock arrangement , with Clapton taking over as lead singer and backing from Starr , Preston and others . Following its appearance in David Leland 's film Concert for George ( 2003 ) and on the accompanying live album , this performance of " Something " was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals . Bob Dylan also played the song live during his November 2002 concerts , as a tribute to Harrison . McCartney has continued to perform " Something " , adopting the Concert for George mix of ukulele and rock backing ; a version with this musical arrangement was included on his 2009 album Good Evening New York City . 
 = = Live performances by Harrison = = 
 Harrison played " Something " at the two Concert for Bangladesh shows , held at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 August 1971 . His first live performance as a solo artist , he was backed by a large band that included Starr , Preston , Clapton and Leon Russell . The version used on the live album and in the 1972 concert film was taken from the evening show that day , when Harrison played it as the final song before returning to perform " Bangla Desh " as an encore . 
 Harrison included " Something " in all of his subsequent , and rare , full @-@ length concert appearances . For his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar , he had been reluctant to feature any material from the Beatles ' catalogue , but at the urging of Shankar and Preston during rehearsals , he added " Something " to the setlist . To the disappointment of many fans , however , he chose to alter some of the song 's lyrics ( such as changing the first line to " If there 's something in the way , remove it " ) . Further distancing himself from the Beatles ' legacy , Harrison told journalists at the start of the tour that he would join a group with Lennon " any day " but rejected the idea of working again with McCartney , since he preferred Willie Weeks as a bassist . MacDonald comments that this statement was likely in reference to McCartney 's " too fussily <unk> " bass part on the Beatles ' 1969 recording . With Boyd having left Harrison for Clapton earlier in 1974 , Larry Sloman of Rolling Stone described the reworked " Something " as " a moving diary of his love life " . 
 A version from Harrison 's December 1991 tour of Japan with Clapton – Harrison 's only other tour as a solo artist – appears on the Live in Japan double album ( 1992 ) . Inglis writes of the track having " extra poignancy " by this time , " in that the woman for whom it was written had been married to , and divorced from , Harrison and Clapton in turn " . Inglis adds : " It is not a new interpretation of the song , but it does suggest a new perspective , in which words and music are used by two close friends to reflect on the lives they have led . "

 = Otto Kittel = 
 Otto " Bruno " Kittel ( 21 February 1917 – 14 or 16 February 1945 ) was a World War II Luftwaffe flying ace . He flew 583 combat missions on the Eastern Front , claiming 267 aerial victories , making him the fourth highest scoring ace in aviation history . Kittel claimed all of his victories flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 against the Red Air Force . 
 Kittel joined the Luftwaffe in 1939 , at the age of 22 and flew his first combat missions in 1941 . In spring 1941 , he joined Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 ) supporting Army Group North on the Eastern Front . Kittel claimed his first victory on 22 June 1941 , the opening day of Operation Barbarossa . Kittel took time to amass his personal tally of aerial victories . By February 1943 , he reached 39 kills , relatively insignificant when compared with some other German aces . In 1943 , his tally began to increase when JG 54 began to operate the Fw 190 . Kittel earned the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 29 October 1943 , for reaching 120 aerial victories . By the time he was awarded the decoration he had a tally of 123 victories . Many of the Soviet aircraft shot down by Kittel were IL @-@ 2 <unk> . 
 During the remainder of World War II , Kittel was credited with 144 more aerial victories and was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords . On 14 or 16 February 1945 , flying his <unk> combat mission , Kittel was shot down and killed by the air gunner of a Shturmovik . Kittel was the most successful German fighter pilot to be killed in action . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Kittel was born on 21 February 1917 in <unk> ( <unk> ) near <unk> in Sudeten Silesia , Austria @-@ Hungary . His father was Eduard Kittel , a farmer . Contrary to the public perception of fighter pilots , author Franz Kurowski describes Kittel as reserved and soft @-@ spoken . 
 Fascinated with flight at an early age , after working briefly as an auto mechanic Kittel joined the Luftwaffe in 1939 at the age of 22 . After completing his training on 12 February 1941 , Kittel was posted to JG 54 based at Jever , Germany . He was assigned to 2 Staffel ( Squadron ) JG 54 at the rank of Unteroffizier . During his training he was described as a good comrade on account of his calm demeanour , presence of mind and sense of duty . Owing to these attributes , his superior officers treated him with respect . During his training and early career Hannes Trautloft became a role model and offered Kittel advice about his techniques . 
 Kittel formed a friendship with German ace Hans Philipp , who often shared advice about aerial combat . Philipp later served as a pastor when Kittel married his fiancé , Edith , in June 1942 at <unk> , after she had travelled into occupied Soviet territory to be with him . The couple had a son , Manfred , who was born in 1945 . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Kittel 's first operations were air superiority missions during the Balkans Campaign . Assigned to support the German invasion of Yugoslavia and the bombing of Belgrade , Kittel 's Geschwader ( Wing ) was credited with 376 aerial victories by the time of the Yugoslavian surrender on 17 April 1941 . During the course of the campaign Kittel acted as wingman for his staffel leader , who was the first to engage any enemy aircraft , and Kittel saw only limited air combat . His only combat actions were during strafing missions against Yugoslav Army forces . On 12 May 1941 , JG 54 handed over its old Bf 109E fighters to Jagdgeschwader 77 ( Fighter Wing 77 ) , and Kittel began intensive training on the new Bf 109F . 
 = = = Operation Barbarossa = = = 
 Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union , began on 22 June 1941 . In the fortnight prior , JG 54 had been moved to an airfield in Lindenthal near <unk> , East Prussia , present @-@ day <unk> in Kaliningrad Oblast . Tasked with supporting Army Group North in its advance through the Baltic states towards Leningrad , the unit began combat operations shortly afterwards . On 24 June 1941 , Kittel claimed his first two aerial victories , two Tupolev SB @-@ 2 bombers , shot down during an early morning mission . On 30 June 1941 , he downed his first Ilyushin Il @-@ 2 Shturmovik . His third victory earned him the Iron Cross , Second Class ( Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse ) . By that time , the German advance had taken JG 54 to Staraya Russa , just south of Leningrad , and they would remain there for nearly two years . 
 By winter 1941 – 1942 , he had 11 victories and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class ( Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse ) in October 1941 . In mid @-@ March , Kittel claimed two <unk> for his 13 – 14 aerial victories but his Bf 109 suffered damage and Kittel returned to base , resisting the urge to chase more and risk his life . His motto was to get back in one piece and avoid risks : " Take the safe route and avoid ill @-@ considered and wild offensive tactics " . In the end that alone produced success , risking himself for a single victory was not Kittel 's way . Within two months , his tally had risen to 17 and in May 1942 , Kittel claimed two more victories : a bomber and a fighter , in one sortie . During the combat , he became involved in a dogfight with two experienced opponents ; the Soviet pilots tried to force him into a trap , one chasing the other in an attempt to cut him off . Kittel 's aircraft was fired on several times and hit but he managed to shoot down one of the Soviet fighters and make his escape . 
 = = = Leningrad Front = = = 
 During the summer of 1942 , aerial victories were rare ; operating in the northern sector of the front usually meant little action as all the Soviet air activity was combating Army Group South 's summer offensive , codenamed Case Blue . Kurowski recounts that Kittel became frustrated at this time , although his ground crew worked to keep up his spirits . On 19 February 1943 , Feldwebel Kittel achieved his 39th victory , which was also JG 54 's 4,000th of the war . JG 54 Geschwaderkommodore ( Wing Commander ) Hannes Trautloft congratulated Kittel , and decreed that he was no longer to be assigned the role of wingman , but would instead be allowed to conduct lone combat patrols . In early 1943 , JG 54 was withdrawn from the frontline to convert to the Fw 190 . With a stronger undercarriage for the harsher conditions on the Eastern Front , greater firepower , speed and agility , the fighter was popular among pilots . Kittel , in particular , was pleased . The Fw 190 was an ideal interceptor against the tough and heavily armoured Shturmovik , his favourite target . At this point , after returning to combat , Kittel 's victory tally climbed rapidly . By mid @-@ March 1943 , Kittel had reached 46 victories , encompassing all types of aircraft . 
 On 14 or 15 March 1943 while on a mission over the Demyansk pocket , Kittel 's Fw 190 suffered engine failure . He was 80 kilometers ( 50 mi ) behind Soviet lines . He removed his precision board clock , an intricately engineered instrument which he was under orders to secure , and landed his Fw 190 which slid 150 meters ( 490 ft ) to a stop in a snow @-@ covered field . During the landing , fellow pilot Herbert <unk> , who had been shot down under similar circumstances , advised Kittel over the radio to hide after landing , to travel only by night and to march compass bearing of 255 degrees ( north @-@ west ) which would take him to Staraya Russa , towards JG 54 's base behind German lines . After exiting his aircraft , Kittel ran for the nearest forest after landing as several locals began emerging from nearby houses . When Kittel got to the forest , he found he had left his emergency rations behind , having only a chocolate bar with him . He continued through the forest . In the dense vegetation , he was able to move during the day unseen . Resting often , he raided several empty houses and found clothes but no food . Determined to find food , and dressed as a Russian peasant , he passed through several Soviet checkpoints looking for something to eat . Kittel spoke Czech and some Russian and managed to evade detection . En route , he stopped at several points and was given food , and eventually Kittel made it to the edge of Lake Ilmen . After nightfall he crossed the frozen lake and made it to German lines , three days after his crash landing . 
 Following his return , Kittel was promoted to Oberfeldwebel ( staff sergeant ) on 18 March 1943 . Kittel took leave in March / April 1943 . By the time he returned Walter Nowotny had taken over the Gruppe ( Group ) . Philipp had left to take command of Jagdgeschwader 1 ( JG 1 ) in Germany , and was later killed in action on 8 October 1943 . On 3 May 1943 , Kittel scored his first aerial victories since his return , claiming three Soviet aircraft in an operation before machine gun fire from a bomber 's rear gunner damaged his aircraft and forced him to crash land . On 10 June 1943 , Kittel achieved another aerial victory , taking his total to 50 . 
 = = = Kursk and the Baltic = = = 
 During the fighting in mid @-@ 1943 , JG 54 took part in many of the spring battles over the Crimea Peninsula , Vyazma @-@ Bryansk , Vitebsk , Kharkov , Orsha and Orel regions . As the spring battles ended , the Germans prepared for Operation Citadel , which led to the Battle of Kursk . During the air battles that followed Kittel 's unit escorted Junkers Ju 87 Stukas of III . / Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 ( Third Group , StG 2 , or Dive Bomber Wing 2 ) , commanded by Hans @-@ Ulrich Rudel . 
 On 5 July 1943 , the Germans launched their attack . By this date , Kittel had claimed 56 victories . During the first day of Citadel , Kittel became an " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " claiming six victories . The next day he shot down three more Soviet aircraft . It was at this point Kittel achieved recognition as one of the most prominent German aces . After the German defeat at Kursk , Kittel 's combat career continued as the German Army retreated to the Dnieper River . Kittel had achieved a one kill per day average to reach 94 victories on 4 September 1943 . Just 10 days later , on 14 September 1943 , Kittel claimed his 100th aerial victory , a Yakovlev Yak @-@ 9 fighter . The 53rd Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark , he received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 29 October 1943 . By the time he was awarded it on 29 October , his tally was 123 aerial victories . The presentation was made by Oberst Franz Reuß . 
 On 1 November 1943 , Kittel was promoted to the rank of Leutnant ( second lieutenant ) . From then until January 1944 Kittel served a the chief instructor of the Ergänzungs @-@ Jagdgruppe Ost ( Training Group East ) in Biarritz , France , providing instructor to trainee fighter pilots . Unhappy in a teaching role , Kittel filed several applications to return to combat , and in March 1944 his request was approved . Kittel subsequently returned to JG 54 on the Eastern Front . 
 In early April , achieved his 150th aerial victory . On April 14 , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) for his 152nd aerial victory , claimed on 12 April . Kittel received the Oak Leaves from Adolf Hitler at the Berghof , Obersalzberg on 5 May 1944 , becoming the <unk> German to receive the award . In May 1944 , 2 . Staffel was transferred to augment III . Gruppe ( 3rd group ) of JG 54 fighting on the Western Front to provide air defense for the Reich amidst increasing Allied aerial attacks . In August 1944 , a new 2 . Staffel was formed from remnants of 3 . Staffel , and Kittel was appointed its Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) . 
 Kittel continued to increase his tally , shooting down another 50 aircraft by 26 August 1944 , bringing his overall total to 200 . By this time , Kittel had converted to flying a Fw 190A @-@ 6 , designated " Yellow 5 " . By the 27 October 1944 , Kittel had achieved 254 victories , a total of 102 in just six months . He earned the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern ) on 25 November 1944 for 264 victories , only the 113th German serviceman to receive the award . Kittel flew to Hitler 's headquarters to receive the award and then continued to Germany to spend his leave there . When he returned in January 1945 , he took JG 54 's second squadron , 2 Staffel . Kittel added a further three victories during his time as the Staffel 's leader . By 13 February 1945 , Kittel had a personal total of 266 aerial victories . 
 At 12 : 06 on 14 or 16 February 1945 , Kittel took off with his Geschwader ( Wing ) flying Fw 190 A @-@ 8 " Black 1 " ( Werknummer — factory number — 690 282 ) to engage a formation of 14 Shturmovik aircraft over the Courland Pocket . His wingman , Oberfähnrich Renner , later reported : At 12 : 13 he made contact with the formation at low altitude , no more than 100 – 150 meters ( 330 – 490 ft ) . Kittel attacked , firing at and damaging several Shturmovik . Kittel damaged one aircraft and chased it . As he closed in for the kill , his Focke @-@ Wulf was hit by return fire from a rear gunner , and descended towards the ground on fire . Kittel , probably incapacitated and unable to use his parachute , did not bail out and the Fw 190 crashed in flames . The site of the crash is believed to have been 6 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) south @-@ west of <unk> in Latvia . Witnesses from Kittel 's formation reported that a Shturmovik had been shot down by Kittel before he himself was killed during the air battle having scored his 267th and final victory .

 = Hey Good Lookin ' ( film ) = 
 Hey Good Lookin ' is a 1982 American adult animated coming of age comedy film written , directed , and produced by Ralph Bakshi . The film takes place in Brooklyn , New York , during the 1950s and focuses on Vinnie , the leader of a gang named " the Stompers , " his friend , Crazy Shapiro , and their girls , Roz and Eva . It features the voices of Richard Romanus , David Proval , Tina Bowman , and Jesse Welles . 
 Hey Good Lookin ' was first completed in 1975 as a live @-@ action / animated combination , in which only the main characters were animated and the rest were portrayed by live actors , but the film 's release was pushed back , and later postponed indefinitely . Warner Bros. claimed that this version of the film was unsatisfactory ; concerns over controversy as the result of the backlash against the film Coonskin were also cited . 
 In 1982 , a very different version of the film was released ; much of the live @-@ action sequences were replaced by animated ones , and dialogue was heavily rewritten and reedited . This version was distributed in a limited release in the United States and went largely unnoticed by the American public ; it performed respectably in foreign markets , and developed a cult following on cable television and home video . The original version of the film remains unreleased . 
 = = Story = = 
 The film opens on a Trash can talking to a pile of Garbage , debating over the existence of Heaven . The Garbage hears a rumbling and declares that God has arrived , and is then scooped into a garbage truck and driven away calling " Fuck this city ! " The camera reveals Brooklyn during the 1980s . A heavyset , middle @-@ aged woman walks alone in the streets , and meets a mysterious man who greets her and shows her the remains of a black leather jacket . The woman sobs at the sight of it , and the man begins his story ... 
 In Brooklyn during the 1950s , Vinnie serves as the leader of a gang named " the Stompers " . His best friend , Crazy Shapiro , is subject to multiple murder attempts by Crazy 's detective father , Solly . While in an old basketball court , Vinnie reunites with an old flame named Rozzie , but their reunion is abruptly interrupted by Rozzie 's protective Jewish father , who chains her to her bed so she won 't meet with Vinnie . Vinnie and Crazy spend the evening drinking , meet up with two prostitutes and go to sleep on the beach , waking up to find themselves close to a group of showering women and their mobster husbands . While Crazy inches over to the ladies , Vinnie finds a dead body buried in the sand . The screams of Vinnie and the women alert the mobsters , who beat up Crazy . It 's later seen that Crazy has killed off the mobsters . 
 Vinnie runs off , finding himself on the black area of the beach where he bumps into rival gang leader Boogaloo Jones and his gang , the Chaplains . Boogaloo sets up a rumble between his gang and the Stompers . Vinnie later meets up with Roz and the girl Crazy dates , Eva ; Crazy has meanwhile beaten all the mobsters . The four head out to a party , where Vinnie tells the Stompers that they are going to fight with the Chaplains , to which the gang responds with negativity . Much of the gang and their girls head out to a rock and roll show . Vinnie is horrified at the idea of Crazy and himself having to fight the Chaplains alone . One of the Stompers named Sal and his girl have a run @-@ in with Boogaloo while driving , and wind up in a car crash on the stage of the show . Vinnie finally persuades the Stompers to rumble with the Chaplains . 
 At a drive @-@ in fast food restaurant , Vinnie and Crazy make out with their girls . When Roz spots a car that she thinks Boogaloo is in , Crazy is quick to drive off after it . Crazy ends up shooting two of the black gang members in an alley , much to Vinnie 's shock . Solly investigates the death of the two black gang members . He questions Boogaloo , who tells him that he should be looking for the Stompers . 
 Crazy and Roz are then seen at a pier . Rozzie tells him that Vinnie is ditching town , her and the rumble , which makes Crazy the leader of the Stompers . Disgusted with Vinnie 's cowardice , Roz allows Crazy to make love to her in an abandoned warehouse . Solly interrupts their time together , and fights boxer @-@ style with Crazy to get him to talk . As he is losing , Crazy lies to his father that Vinnie killed the gang members . Vinnie packs up his things and tries to avoid the rumble , but bumps into the Stompers and is unfortunately in time for the rumble . As the two gangs wait for Boogaloo to show up , Solly drives up , ready to arrest Vinnie . On the rooftop of a nearby building , Crazy begins shooting randomly towards the street , causing both gangs to begin shooting at each other , and fights against his own hallucinations — including garbage can monsters and giant naked women . Vinnie tries to run and is shot at by Solly . Crazy jumps off the rooftop , landing on Solly , killing himself and Solly at the same time — perhaps to save Vinnie . As Roz calls up a radio station to make a memorial request in honor of Vinnie 's apparent demise , he stands up and walks away , leaving Brooklyn . 
 The scene returns to Long Island in the 1980s . As the mysterious man finishes his story , he claims he left because he was heartbroken over the death of Crazy . The woman knows he is lying . She reveals that she is Roz , and that the man is Vinnie , returned after 30 years . Roz angrily berates him for abandoning her and the gang just to save his own skin . Roz tells him that her husband will soon come looking for her , and he hates to see her with any other man . She gives Vinnie a second chance , if he will fight for her like she wished he did before . But she 's bluffing . At first Vinnie imagines himself walking out on her again , but then embraces Roz telling her " I 've been waiting for you . " The lovers reunite .

 After production concluded on Harlem Nights , Bakshi wanted to distinguish himself artistically by producing a film in which live action and animated characters would interact . Bakshi began writing the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin ' while editing Coonskin , and storyboarding a proposed series for ABC . The characters of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro were based upon Bakshi 's high school friends , Norman <unk> and Allen <unk> . Warner Bros. had previously agreed to distribute Fritz the Cat before pulling their funding from that film , but were eager to option the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin ' , and greenlit the film in 1973 . Several African American animators , including graffiti artists , were hired by Bakshi 's studio , at a time when black animators were not widely employed by major animation studios . Following controversy over the film Coonskin , some black animators left Bakshi 's studio in embarrassment , resulting in production problems for Hey Good Lookin ' . 
 Principal photography began in 1974 . The budget was $ 1 @.@ 5 million . Pre @-@ production lasted one week , including casting . <unk> sequences were shot on the streets of New York City , while less serious locations were shot on Warner Bros. ' sound stages in Los Angeles . According to Bakshi , " What I would do is dress guys up , live @-@ action guys . Very strange dudes ! The weirdest guys I could find . Having them talk to animated characters in front of candy stores , discussing girlfriends and such . It was very surrealistic . " Yaphet Kotto and the glam punk band New York Dolls were cast in the live action sequences , with the New York Dolls playing homosexuals . Mean Streets actors Richard Romanus and David Proval were cast as the voices of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro . Much of the shooting of live action sequences and recording of animated dialogue involved improvisation , with Bakshi setting up the premise of the scene and allowing his actors to create their own dialogue . During the " rumble " sequence , the actors playing the Chaplains were filmed popping and performing styles of dance which later evolved into breakdancing , dance styles which were unheard of in the 1970s studio system . 
 Bakshi had selected a number of songs from his own record collection for the film 's soundtrack , which were not used in the film due to the high costs of licensing the songs . The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks , who became involved with the production of the film in 1974 . Because the release of the delay of the film 's release , Hicks ' label released the material from these sessions under the title It Happened One Bite . When the film was released in 1982 , it had been rescored by John Madara . 
 Much of the cinematography was shot at night , because Bakshi felt that the daylight made the scenes less believable . Bakshi recounts that during the first day of shooting , the actors were unable to play their roles naturally , but began casually talking and acting the way he wanted their characters to act when the cameras were off , including flirting with an actress . However , the camera man was not around to capture these events , so Bakshi filmed them himself . When Bakshi excitedly told William A. Fraker about this , Fraker quit the production , and was replaced by a young cinematographer who had never worked in film before . 
 = = Post @-@ production and release = = 
 During the post @-@ production of the film , Bakshi found that the cost of the optical effect required to complete live @-@ action scenes with animated characters was larger than the film 's budget . In order to complete these scenes cost effectively , Bakshi and his camera man Ted C. <unk> purchased a 35 mm camera to project the footage onto the glass under the animation camera , which was reflected onto where the animation was shot . The same technique was used for the rotoscoped scenes in The Lord of the Rings . According to Bakshi , " The illusion I attempted to create was that of a completely live @-@ action film . Making it work almost drove us crazy . " 
 A three @-@ minute promo of the live @-@ action version of Hey Good Lookin ' was screened at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival ; a print of this promo is owned by the UCLA Film and Television Archive . The film was initially scheduled for a Christmas 1975 release , but was moved to the summers of 1976 and later 1977 , before ultimately being postponed indefinitely . Warner Bros. was concerned about any controversy the film would encounter controversy as a result of the backlash over the film Coonskin , despite the fact that Hey Good Lookin ' did not contain any political content . The studio also felt that the film was " unreleasable " because of its combination of live @-@ action and animation , but would not spend further money on the project . Bakshi financed the film 's completion himself out of the director 's fees for other projects he headed from 1976 until 1982 , such as : Wizards , The Lord of the Rings , and American Pop . 
 Warner Bros. president Frank Wells told film trades that Hey Good Lookin ' needed to be " fine @-@ tuned " , claiming that Bakshi needed to revamp the dialogue and reshoot some scenes because they had not tested well with market research audiences . During production meetings , Wells told Bakshi that he had not fulfilled his contractual obligations and had used more live @-@ action than he said he would ; Bakshi 's lawyer was able to convince the studio not to sue him . 
 The majority of the live action footage was deleted ; because Bakshi wanted to keep the breakdancing sequences , he used rotoscoping to animate the footage , but did not animate all of the movements for budgetary reasons . Little dialogue from the 1974 cut of the film was retained in the animated version , which instead featured newly recorded dialogue by Proval , Romanus , and Philip Michael Thomas , who had starred in Coonskin . 
 Following the success of Heavy Metal and American Pop , Warner Bros. became excited about the second version of Hey Good Lookin ' , forming a specialty division for the film 's distribution . The film opened in New York City on October 1 , 1982 , and was released in Los Angeles in January 1983 . Although it went largely unnoticed by the American public , it received respectable business in foreign markets . 
 = = Response = = 
 In a brief review , Vincent Canby wrote that it was " not exactly incoherent , but whatever it originally had on its mind seems to have slipped away " . Leonard Maltin wrote that the film is " more interesting visually than Bakshi 's other later films , [ ... ] but as entertainment it 's vulgar and pointless . " 
 Animation historian Jerry Beck wrote that " the beginning of the film is quite promising , with a garbage can discussing life on the streets with some garbage . This is an example of what Bakshi did best — - using the medium of animation to comment on society . Unfortunately , he doesn 't do it enough in this film . There is a wildly imaginative fantasy sequence during the climax , when the character named Crazy starts hallucinating during a rooftop shooting spree . This scene almost justifies the whole film .

 = Galveston Bay Area = 
 The Galveston Bay Area ( known as the Bay Area ) is a region that surrounds the Galveston Bay estuary of Southeast Texas in the United States , within Houston – The Woodlands – Sugar Land metropolitan area . Normally the term refers to the mainland communities around the bay and excludes Galveston as well as most of Houston . 
 Originally part of the pirate kingdom of Jean Lafitte , this area played a role in the early history of Texas having been the site of some early rebellions against Mexican rule and the site of the victory of the Texas army over the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution . Ranching interests became early economic drivers around the bay . As the nearby cities of Galveston and Houston developed as commercial centers , the Bay Area communities became part of a principal commercial corridor between the cities . 
 The Bay Area is also the location of NASA 's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center which houses the Christopher C. Kraft Jr . Mission Control Center . The City of Houston 's official nickname as " Space City " is derived from this . In addition , a large tourist attraction for area visitors is Space Center Houston . 
 The landscape around the bay features a mix of swamps , beaches , industrial facilities , tourist attractions , and historic sites . The area 's developing population is ethnically diverse with a growing international community . The communities host cultural events ranging from ballet and musical theater to fairs and rodeos . The bay itself supports a commercial fishing industry and features one of the highest concentrations of marinas in the nation . On land the area holds numerous historic sites such as the San Jacinto Monument , and many parks and nature preserves such as the Armand Bayou Nature Center . 
 = = Boundaries = = 
 The shores of Galveston Bay are home to many different municipalities and communities . The region is part of the larger Houston – Sugar Land – Baytown Metropolitan Area . Though the term Bay Area in its broadest sense refers to all communities near the shoreline , some sources , such as the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership ( <unk> ) , use more limited definitions , often referring more specifically to the clusters of communities nearest to Houston . 
 = = = Municipalities = = = 
 The following communities lie on the shores of Galveston Bay proper and Trinity Bay , the two main components of the Galveston Bay complex ( excluding those along the Gulf of Mexico ) : 
 Anahuac , Bacliff , Baytown , Beach City , Kemah , La Porte , Morgan 's Point , Seabrook , <unk> , Pasadena , Texas City 
 The <unk> and the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce ( <unk> ) include the following additional communities in their membership : 
 Clear Lake <unk> of Houston ( which includes Clear Lake City and JSC ) , Clear Lake Shores , Deer Park , Dickinson , El Lago , Friendswood , League City , Nassau Bay , Taylor Lake Village , Webster . 
 Some additional communities such as La Marque , adjacent to Texas City , are treated as bayside communities by some sources . 
 = = = Subdivisions = = = 
 The Bay Area can be sub @-@ divided based on the histories and economic connections of the different communities . 
 The Pasadena – Baytown area , including Deer Park and La Porte , straddles the Houston Ship Channel and has since the world wars been defined by the heavy industry along its shores . The two towns have distinct histories with Baytown having become tied to the oil industry earlier and Pasadena having a longer history tied to ranching and agriculture before petrochemicals came to dominate . But in modern times their fortunes have been closely tied by their cores of heavy industry . 
 The Clear Lake Area includes numerous communities and municipalities surrounding Clear Lake between Pasadena , Houston , and the bay . This area largely owes its recent growth and prosperity directly and indirectly to the Johnson Space Center , and has been traditionally characterized by a large white collar workforce and its prolific middle- and upper @-@ middle @-@ class neighborhoods . The area is sometimes seen as the heart of the Bay Area in spite of the relative youth of its history . 
 The Texas City area includes Texas City and La Marque and surrounding communities . Until recently this area and Galveston together were treated by the federal government as a metro area distinct from Houston . The area 's prosperity revolves to a great degree around the Port of Texas City and the heavy industry around it . 
 The bayside region of Chambers County encompasses the shoreline of Trinity Bay ( and East Bay ) , on the northeast side of the bay complex . This area includes Anahuac as its largest community . Some of the area remains semi @-@ rural and oriented to agriculture and commercial fishing but petroleum and chemical processing are significant industries as well . Urban development is more limited giving the area a more small @-@ town and rural atmosphere . This area 's history is somewhat distinct from the other areas around the bay as it is not part of the once crucial commercial corridor between Galveston and Houston . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Spain , Mexico , and the Republic of Texas = = = 
 Prior to European settlement the area around Galveston Bay was settled by the Karankawa and Atakapan tribes , who lived throughout the Gulf coast region . Spanish explorers such as the Rivas @-@ Iriarte expedition and José Antonio de Evia charted the bay and gave it its name . In 1816 the pirate Louis @-@ Michel Aury established a settlement on Galveston Island but was soon succeeded by the pirate Jean Lafitte . Lafitte transformed Galveston and the bay into a pirate kingdom establishing bases and hide @-@ outs at locations such as Trinity Bay , Clear Lake , and Eagle Point . In 1821 , however , the United States Navy ousted Lafitte and the colony was largely abandoned . 
 Following its declaration of independence from Spain the new nation of Mexico moved to colonize its northern territory of Texas by offering land grants to settlers both from within Mexico and from the nearby United States . Small settlements such as Lynchburg and San Jacinto were gradually established around the bay and in 1830 Mexican authorities created a customs and garrison post at Anahuac commanded by Juan Davis Bradburn . Conflicts between Bradburn and the settlers in the region led to the Anahuac Disturbances , a prelude to the larger Texas rebellion that was to come . Following a coup in the Mexican government many freedoms previously enjoyed by the Texans were revoked causing Texas to revolt and declare its independence in 1835 . After a number of battles the Texas army , under the leadership of General Sam Houston , finally defeated the Mexican Army in the Battle of San Jacinto , near modern Pasadena . 
 The new Republic of Texas grew rapidly . The shores of the bay were initially mostly home to farms and ranches such as the famed Allen Ranch . New communities such as Goose Creek ( modern Baytown ) were established . 
 = = = U.S. annexation = = = 
 Texas succeeded in its bid to join the United States in 1845 which helped launch the Mexican @-@ American War . Texas ' annexation brought more people to Texas and ranching interests around the bay began to grow . Throughout the 19th century Galveston remained Texas ' dominant metropolis and the communities around the bay were strongly tied economically and culturally to the city though , as Houston began to develop , so did the Bay Area 's ties to it . The construction of the Galveston , Houston and Henderson Railroad further spurred growth in the area . 
 During the American Civil War , during which Texas seceded from the United States , the area served a limited role in the conflict as new fortifications like Fort Chambers , near Anahuac , were constructed to ward off a mainland invasion by Union forces and to protect supply routes to and from Galveston . The Bay Area sat in the middle of the conflict as the most important battles in Texas occurred at Galveston with the conflict moving through the area on to Harrisburg and Houston after Galveston 's fall . 
 In the aftermath of the war the Texas economy declined for a period . Nevertheless , ranching interests became major economic drivers in the area spawning many other economic enterprises such as hide processing plants and shipping concerns . The success of these enterprises and the growth of Galveston as one of the prime commercial centers in the South and Southwest helped promote the construction of the Gulf , Colorado and Santa Fe Railway ; and the La Porte , Houston and Northern Railroad through the area over the course of the 19th century . These railroads running along the southwest shore of the bay would spawn new communities such as Clear Creek ( League City ) , Webster , and later Texas City . Some of these new communities would develop initially as stop @-@ over points for travelers on the rail lines . Toward the end of the century , as ranching 's profitability declined , many communities turned increasingly to agriculture . The farming community of Pasadena was established during this time . 
 The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 devastated the city of Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay ( according to some estimates the Bay Area death toll may have been as high as 2000 ) . Bridges between Galveston and the mainland were destroyed . Communities along the shoreline declined for some time as economic growth moved inland and Houston became the dominant economic center in the region . The region received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 The sparsely populated Bay Area transformed during the 20th century . Following the hurricane , donations by the newly established Red Cross helped revive area farming communities . The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain . Commercial fishing , particularly for oysters and shrimp , grew as a significant area industry . 
 In the early 1900s the Goose Creek Oil Field was discovered launching an oil boom at Galveston Bay . In 1915 Goose Creek acquired the first offshore oil drilling site in the state and soon after refineries opened in Texas City , Baytown and Pasadena . The Humble Oil refinery in Baytown became the largest in the Houston area . The wealth brought on by the boom transformed the region and population surged . Manufacturing and refining expanded rapidly . During the Roaring 20s , tourism and resort communities developed around Clear Lake and the bay shoreline in communities such as Morgan 's Point , Seabrook , Kemah . 
 The World Wars created new manufacturing opportunities for factories around the bay and the area 's population grew even faster than Houston . Ellington Air Force Base was built becoming a major air field and flight training center during the wars . 
 After the war area economic diversification brought on by the war effort helped in the transition to a peacetime economy . NASA 's Johnson Space Center was established in 1963 helping to spur explosive growth in the mid @-@ 20th century , especially the 1970s and 1980s . The remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore urbanized and development connected the area to Houston . Tourism and recreation re @-@ emerged and blossomed particularly around the Clear Lake area and the nearby shoreline . 
 Hurricane Ike struck the Bay Area in 2008 causing substantial damage both environmentally and economically , the most destructive event since 1900 . As of 2009 a proposal to build a levee system , the Ike Dike , to protect the bay is under discussion . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Galveston Bay Area is located on the gulf coastal plain , and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and marshes . The municipalities have been built on reclaimed marshes , swamps , and prairies , which are all still visible in undeveloped areas . Flatness of the local terrain and proximity to the Bay and the Gulf have made flooding a recurring problem for the area . The region once relied on groundwater for its needs , but land subsidence has forced much of the region to turn to ground @-@ level water sources . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 The land beneath the Bay Area consists of layers of sand and clay to great depths . These layers were created by millennia of river @-@ borne sediments which gradually incorporated plant and animal matter creating the petroleum deposits for which the Gulf Coast is known . 
 The region has numerous faults , many considered active , but none has produced significant earthquakes in recorded history . These faults tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed fault creep , which reduces the risk of an earthquake . 
 = = = Bay and coastline = = = 
 Galveston Bay is an estuary along the Texas Gulf Coast . The bay as a whole is composed of four major sub @-@ bays : Galveston Bay proper , Trinity Bay , East Bay , and West Bay . Other smaller bays and lakes connecting to this complex of waterways in the Bay Area include San Jacinto Bay , Burnet Bay , Scott Bay , Crystal Bay , Goose Lake , Clear Lake , Dickinson Bay , and Moses Lake . 
 Galveston Bay is mostly shallow with an average depth of 7 – 9 feet . It is fed by the Trinity River and the San Jacinto River , numerous local bayous and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico . This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources supports many types of marine life including crabs , shrimp , oysters , and many varieties of fish thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry . Additionally the system of bayous , rivers , and marshes that ring the Bay support their own ecosystems allowing for diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish . The areas near the bay shore in fact have a higher diversity of habitats than the nearby Gulf coast . 
 The bay receives the fourth highest level of toxic chemicals in the state from bayside industrial discharge , in addition to pollutants washing in from the Houston Ship Channel . Although contaminants from the major industrial complexes along the bay contribute substantially to bay pollution , most is the result of storm run @-@ off from various commercial , agricultural , and residential sources . In recent decades , conservation efforts have been enacted which have improved water quality in the bay . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 The Bay Area 's climate is classified as humid subtropical ( Cfa in Köppen climate classification system ) . Spring supercell thunderstorms sometimes create tornados ( but not to the extent found in tornado alley ) . Prevailing winds from the south and southeast bring heat from the deserts of Mexico and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico . 
 Summer temperatures regularly exceed 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) . The area 's proximity to the bay and the winds that it generates moderate the area 's temperatures and ease the effects of the humidity creating a more pleasant climate than inland communities like Houston ( e.g. the average July high in Texas City is 89 ° F ( 32 ° C ) with 9 @.@ 8 mph ( 15 @.@ 8 km / h ) winds vs. 94 ° F ( 34 ° C ) with 6 @.@ 7 mph ( 10 @.@ 8 km / h ) winds in Houston ) . Winters in the area are temperate with typical January highs above 60 ° F ( 16 ° C ) and lows are near 40 ° F ( 4 ° C ) . Snowfall is rare . Annual rainfall averages can range from 40 to 50 inches ( 100 to 130 cm ) depending on the community . 
 Excessive ozone levels can occur due to industrial activities ; nearby Houston is ranked among the most ozone @-@ polluted cities in the United States . The industries located along the ship channel and the bay are a major cause of the pollution . 
 Hurricanes are a substantial concern during the fall season . Though Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula provide some shielding , the Bay Area still faces more danger than Houston and other inland communities , particularly because of storm surge . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The Bay Area has a diverse economy with much of it built around aerospace , petrochemicals , and high tech industries . The region 's economy is closely tied to the rest of the Houston area though the mix of local businesses is somewhat unique . In 2005 , the median household income for the Clear Lake area was $ 62 @,@ 061 compared to $ 50 @,@ 868 for the Houston area as whole and $ 45 @,@ 472 for all of Texas . 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The Bay Area 's four major employment sectors are aerospace , petrochemicals and chemical processing , high @-@ tech ( software , biotechnology , electronics , etc . ) , and tourism . Most other employment in the region is supported by these industries although some smaller , independent industries exist as well . 
 The most widespread economic activities in the area revolve around petroleum and petrochemicals , largely centered in Baytown , Pasadena / La Porte , and Texas City . These industries in Houston and the Bay Area account for nearly half of the U.S. petrochemical manufacturing and approximately one third of the U.S. petroleum refining capacity . The Bay Area is home to the largest refineries and petrochemical complexes in the Greater Houston area and to the majority of the processing capacity . 
 NASA 's Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) is an important pillar of the Bay Area economy . Businesses around this core include a broad range of high @-@ tech development enterprises from aerospace engineering to software and electronics . 
 The tourism industry attracts millions of visitors each year with attractions ranging from Space Center Houston to the bay itself . Ecotourism , in particular , is a growing sector with destinations such as the Armand Bayou Nature Center . Biotechnology , which already employs nearly 3000 workers in the area , is a smaller but growing industry in the area enabled in large part by JSC and the Texas Medical Center in Houston . Commercial fishing is one the older industries in the region and is still a significant economic sector . 
 Some outlying areas around the bay remain semi @-@ rural . Cattle ranching and agriculture remain staples of some local economies as well as shrimp fishing and oyster farming . 
 = = = Economic hubs = = = 
 Major Bay Area economic hubs include the following : 
 Bayport Industrial District - A large complex of chemical processing facilities comprising 57 companies with a business impact of over $ 829 million . 
 Johnson Space Center - The central facility of NASA , this site manages more than $ 4 billion annually in aerospace contracts , and together with numerous private companies involved in space programs and related ventures gives the Bay Area one of the highest concentrations of aerospace businesses and expertise in the nation . Additionally , JSC 's research in <unk> has helped create a growing biotechnology industry in the area . The Galveston Bay area is home to 92 % of the Houston @-@ Galveston area aerospace jobs . 
 ExxonMobil Baytown Complex — One of the world 's largest petrochemical industrial complexes , this complex is Baytown 's largest employer and one of the largest in the area . For its part the Baytown Refinery located on this site is the largest refinery in the United States and is capable of processing 572 @,@ 000 barrels of oil per day . 
 Texas City Industrial Complex — This petrochemical complex includes the BP Texas City Refinery , the state 's second largest . 
 Barbours Cut Terminal - This shipping terminal , the largest of the terminals operated by the Port of Houston Authority , handles in excess of 3 million tons of cargo annually . 
 Ellington Airport - This mixed @-@ use ( military @-@ civilian ) airport is part of the Houston Airport System and home to the 147th Reconnaissance Wing of the Texas Air National Guard . The airfield has traditionally been a major contributor to the local economy though government realignments have scaled back the base 's military role through the years . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Home to a diverse set of communities , the Bay Area has a demographic distribution that varies greatly among these individual communities . Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the City of Houston ( 2008 , where available , and 2000 otherwise ) , the area demographic statistics are as follows ( see table for more details ) . The total population was approximately 566 @,@ 850 . The median household income was $ 56 @,@ 827 . The white population was 72 @.@ 9 % , the African American population was 8 @.@ 3 % , and the Asian population was 3 @.@ 9 % . 
 The most populous community in the region is Pasadena ( though Houston is a much larger city , the portion within this region is smaller than Pasadena ) . Taylor Lake Village has ( by far ) the highest median household income ; and Bacliff and San Leon have the lowest . Texas City and La Marque have the largest African @-@ American populations . La Porte and the Clear Lake area of Houston have the largest Asian populations . 
 = = Education = = 
 = = = Colleges and universities = = = 
 The Bay Area contains several institutions of higher education . The largest is the University of Houston – Clear Lake ( UHCL ) located adjacent to Clear Lake City . UHCL is separate and distinct from the University of Houston ( UH ) , but it is part of the larger University of Houston System . The university offers a wide spectrum of programs including what it touts as the most complete biotechnology graduate programs in the state . 
 Texas Chiropractic College in Pasadena , one of only two schools of <unk> in Texas and one of a handful in the nation , provides training for students from around the state . Several community colleges serve communities in the area as well , including San Jacinto College , College of the Mainland , Lee College , and Houston Community College . 
 = = = Primary and secondary schools = = = 
 The Bay Area covers multiple municipalities with multiple school districts . Most of the communities in the Clear Lake Area are served by Clear Creek Independent School District though some nearby areas are served by Dickinson and Houston Independent School Districts . Communities in the Pasadena / Baytown area are served by Deer Park , Goose Creek Consolidated , La Porte , and Pasadena Independent School Districts . The Friendswood area is served by the Friendswood Independent School District . The Texas City area is served by La Marque and Texas City Independent School Districts . The communities in Chambers County near Anahuac are served by Anahuac Independent School District and Barbers Hill Independent School District . 
 As of 2009 these 11 districts , excluding Houston ISD , have a total of 190 primary and secondary schools . Of these Clear Creek , Deer Park , Goose Creek , Barbers Hill and Anahuac ISD were evaluated as " recognized " districts ( the second highest ranking ) by the Texas Education Agency , or TEA . All of the others were evaluated as " academically acceptable " with the exception of Texas City ISD , which was evaluated as " academically unacceptable " . 
 67 ( 35 % ) of the schools were ranked as " exemplary " ( the highest ranking ) ; 62 ( 33 % ) were ranked as " recognized " ; 39 ( 21 % ) were ranked as " academically acceptable " ; 2 ( 1 % ) were ranked as " academically unacceptable " ; and 20 ( 11 % ) were not rated by the TEA . Notably 100 % of Friendswood ISD schools and 65 % of Clear Creek ISD schools were " exemplary " , the highest percentages of these 10 districts . Overall , of the schools that were rated , 37 % of the schools in these 10 districts were " exemplary " , compared with 29 % for the entire state .

 The Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership ( <unk> ) coordinates planning for the transportation needs of the Bay Area . Collaborative efforts by the local communities have helped push forward development of regional infrastructure . 
 = = = Ground transportation = = = 
 The Bay Area 's two interstate freeways act as linear backbones connecting the communities on either side of the ship channel . The few other freeways in the region provide access into the centers of heavy industry within the region . Connectivity within other communities mostly relies on uncontrolled , surface highways . 
 Interstate 45 ( the Gulf Freeway ) is the major freeway for the core areas of the Bay Area linking them with Houston and Galveston . Highway 146 ( Bayport Blvd . ) is a coastal highway linking the waterfronts of the communities . The Gulf Freeway and Bayport Blvd. together are the main arteries linking the Clear Lake Area communities and Pasadena , though Highway 225 , East Beltway 8 , Highway 3 and others are important as well . The Fred Hartman Bridge on Highway 146 crosses the ship channel connecting Baytown and Pasadena , while the Galveston Causeway on the Gulf Freeway crosses the bay connecting Texas City and Galveston Island . 
 In the outlying north Bay Area , Interstate 10 links Anahuac and other communities nearby connecting them to Houston and the rest of the Bay Area . Highway 124 provides access to the Bolivar Peninsula . 
 The Houston Metro bus system provides service to the southeast Houston and Pasadena connecting the communities with central Houston . The remaining communities in the Bay Area communities are not served by mass transit . Greyhound Bus Lines , which provides service to cities nationwide , has stations at Baytown and La Marque / Texas City .
