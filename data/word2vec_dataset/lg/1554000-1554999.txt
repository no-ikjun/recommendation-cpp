 = Fish = 
 A fish is any member of a paraphyletic group of organisms that consist of all gill @-@ bearing aquatic <unk> animals that lack limbs with digits . Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish , as well as various extinct related groups . Most fish are ectothermic ( " cold @-@ blooded " ) , allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change , though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature . Fish are abundant in most bodies of water . They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments , from high mountain streams ( e.g. , char and gudgeon ) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans ( e.g. , <unk> and anglerfish ) . With 33 @,@ 100 described species , fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates . 
 Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide , especially as food . Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries ( see fishing ) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean ( see aquaculture ) . They are also caught by recreational fishers , kept as pets , raised by <unk> , and exhibited in public aquaria . Fish have had a role in culture through the ages , serving as deities , religious symbols , and as the subjects of art , books and movies . 
 Because the term " fish " is defined negatively , and excludes the tetrapods ( i.e. , the amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals ) which descend from within the same ancestry , it is paraphyletic , and is not considered a proper grouping in systematic biology . The traditional term <unk> ( also <unk> ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification . 
 The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft @-@ bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period . Although they lacked a true spine , they possessed <unk> which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts . Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era , diversifying into a wide variety of forms . Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators . The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period , after which many ( such as sharks ) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 Fish do not represent a monophyletic group , and therefore the " evolution of fish " is not studied as a single event . 
 Early fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small , jawless , armored fish known as <unk> . <unk> fish lineages are mostly extinct . An extant clade , the lampreys may approximate ancient pre @-@ jawed fish . The first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils . The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth . It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force , improved respiration , or a combination of factors . 
 Fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral @-@ like Sea squirt , whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways . The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood ( as some sea squirts do today ) , although perhaps the reverse is the case . 
 = = = Taxonomy = = = 
 Fish are a paraphyletic group : that is , any clade containing all fish also contains the tetrapods , which are not fish . For this reason , groups such as the " Class Pisces " seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal classifications . 
 Traditional classification divide fish into three extant classes , and with extinct forms sometimes classified within the tree , sometimes as their own classes : 
 Class <unk> ( jawless fish ) 
 Subclass <unk> ( hagfish and lampreys ) 
 Subclass <unk> ( armoured jawless fish ) † 
 Class Chondrichthyes ( cartilaginous fish ) 
 Subclass Elasmobranchii ( sharks and rays ) 
 Subclass <unk> ( chimaeras and extinct relatives ) 
 Class Placodermi ( armoured fish ) † 
 Class <unk> ( " spiny sharks " , sometimes classified under bony fishes ) † 
 Class Osteichthyes ( bony fish ) 
 Subclass Actinopterygii ( ray finned fishes ) 
 Subclass <unk> ( fleshy finned fishes , ancestors of tetrapods ) 
 The above scheme is the one most commonly encountered in non @-@ specialist and general works . Many of the above groups are paraphyletic , in that they have given rise to successive groups : <unk> are ancestral to Chondrichthyes , who again have given rise to <unk> , the ancestors of Osteichthyes . With the arrival of phylogenetic nomenclature , the fishes has been split up into a more detailed scheme , with the following major groups : 
 Class <unk> ( hagfish ) 
 Class <unk> † ( early jawless fish ) 
 Class <unk> † 
 Class <unk> † 
 Class <unk> or <unk> 
 <unk> ( lampreys ) 
 Class <unk> ( conodonts ) †

 Infraclass Holostei ( gars and bowfins ) 
 Infraclass Teleostei ( many orders of common fish ) 
 Class <unk> ( lobe @-@ finned fish ) 
 Subclass <unk> ( coelacanths ) 
 Subclass <unk> ( lungfish ) 
 † – indicates extinct taxon 
 Some palaeontologists contend that because <unk> are chordates , they are primitive fish . For a fuller treatment of this taxonomy , see the vertebrate article . 
 The position of hagfish in the phylum Chordata is not settled . Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported the idea that the hagfish and the lampreys form a natural group , the <unk> , that is a sister group of the <unk> . 
 The various fish groups account for more than half of vertebrate species . There are almost 28 @,@ 000 known extant species , of which almost 27 @,@ 000 are bony fish , with 970 sharks , rays , and chimeras and about 108 hagfish and lampreys . A third of these species fall within the nine largest families ; from largest to smallest , these families are Cyprinidae , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Loricariidae , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . About 64 families are monotypic , containing only one species . The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32 @,@ 500 . 
 = = Diversity = = 
 The term " fish " most precisely describes any non @-@ tetrapod <unk> ( i.e. an animal with a skull and in most cases a backbone ) that has gills throughout life and whose limbs , if any , are in the shape of fins . Unlike groupings such as birds or mammals , fish are not a single clade but a paraphyletic collection of taxa , including hagfishes , lampreys , sharks and rays , ray @-@ finned fish , coelacanths , and lungfish . Indeed , lungfish and coelacanths are closer relatives of tetrapods ( such as mammals , birds , amphibians , etc . ) than of other fish such as ray @-@ finned fish or sharks , so the last common ancestor of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods . As paraphyletic groups are no longer recognised in modern systematic biology , the use of the term " fish " as a biological group must be avoided . 
 Many types of aquatic animals commonly referred to as " fish " are not fish in the sense given above ; examples include shellfish , cuttlefish , starfish , crayfish and jellyfish . In earlier times , even biologists did not make a distinction – sixteenth century natural historians classified also seals , whales , amphibians , crocodiles , even hippopotamuses , as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates , as fish . However , according to the definition above , all mammals , including cetaceans like whales and dolphins , are not fish . In some contexts , especially in aquaculture , the true fish are referred to as finfish ( or fin fish ) to distinguish them from these other animals . 
 A typical fish is ectothermic , has a streamlined body for rapid swimming , extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen , has two sets of paired fins , usually one or two ( rarely three ) dorsal fins , an anal fin , and a tail fin , has jaws , has skin that is usually covered with scales , and lays eggs . 
 Each criterion has exceptions . Tuna , swordfish , and some species of sharks show some warm @-@ blooded adaptations — they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature . <unk> and swimming performance varies from fish such as tuna , salmon , and jacks that can cover 10 – 20 body @-@ lengths per second to species such as eels and rays that swim no more than 0 @.@ 5 body @-@ lengths per second . Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures . Lungfish have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods , <unk> have a structure called the labyrinth organ that performs a similar function , while many catfish , such as <unk> extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach . Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable , covering such seemingly un @-@ fishlike forms as seahorses , pufferfish , anglerfish , and <unk> . Similarly , the surface of the skin may be naked ( as in moray eels ) , or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as <unk> ( typical of sharks and rays ) , <unk> ( fossil lungfish and coelacanths ) , ganoid ( various fossil fish but also living gars and bichirs ) , cycloid , and ctenoid ( these last two are found on most bony fish ) . There are even fish that live mostly on land . Mudskippers feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows . The catfish <unk> <unk> lives in underground , phreatic habitats , and a relative lives in waterlogged leaf litter . 
 Fish range in size from the huge 16 @-@ metre ( 52 ft ) whale shark to the tiny 8 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) stout <unk> . 
 Fish species diversity is roughly divided equally between marine ( oceanic ) and freshwater ecosystems . Coral reefs in the Indo @-@ Pacific constitute the center of diversity for marine fishes , whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests , especially the Amazon , Congo , and Mekong basins . More than 5 @,@ 600 fish species inhabit Neotropical <unk> alone , such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10 % of all vertebrate species on the Earth . Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin , such as Cantão State Park , can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 = = = Respiration = = = 
 = = = = Gills = = = = 
 Most fish exchange gases using gills on either side of the pharynx . Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments . Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide . Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen @-@ rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills . In some fish , capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water , causing countercurrent exchange . The gills push the oxygen @-@ poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx . Some fish , like sharks and lampreys , possess multiple gill openings . However , bony fish have a single gill opening on each side . This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum . 
 Juvenile bichirs have external gills , a very primitive feature that they share with larval amphibians . 
 = = = = Air breathing = = = = 
 Fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended periods . Amphibious fish such as the <unk> can live and move about on land for up to several days , or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water . Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms . The skin of <unk> eels may absorb oxygen directly . The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air . Catfish of the families Loricariidae , <unk> , and <unk> absorb air through their digestive tracts . Lungfish , with the exception of the Australian lungfish , and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills . Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way . <unk> , <unk> , and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut . Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin ( similar to frogs ) . A number of fish have evolved so @-@ called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air . Labyrinth fish ( such as <unk> and <unk> ) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function . A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function , most notably snakeheads , <unk> , and the <unk> catfish family . 
 Breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow , seasonally variable waters where the water 's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline . Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen , such as perch and cichlids , quickly suffocate , while air @-@ breathers survive for much longer , in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud . At the most extreme , some air @-@ breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water , entering a state of aestivation ( summertime hibernation ) until water returns . 
 Air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers . Obligate air breathers , such as the African lungfish , must breathe air periodically or they suffocate . Facultative air breathers , such as the catfish <unk> <unk> , only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen . Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators . 
 = = = Circulation = = = 
 Fish have a closed @-@ loop circulatory system . The heart pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body . In most fish , the heart consists of four parts , including two chambers and an entrance and exit . The first part is the sinus <unk> , a thin @-@ walled sac that collects blood from the fish 's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part , the atrium , which is a large muscular chamber . The atrium serves as a one @-@ way antechamber , sends blood to the third part , ventricle . The ventricle is another thick @-@ walled , muscular chamber and it pumps the blood , first to the fourth part , bulbus arteriosus , a large tube , and then out of the heart . The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta , through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation . 
 = = = Digestion = = = 
 Jaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food , including plants and other organisms . Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus . In the stomach , food is further digested and , in many fish , processed in finger @-@ shaped pouches called pyloric caeca , which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients . Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract . The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption . 
 = = = Excretion = = = 
 As with many aquatic animals , most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia . Some of the wastes diffuse through the gills . Blood wastes are filtered by the kidneys . 
 Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of osmosis . Their kidneys return water to the body . The reverse happens in freshwater fish : they tend to gain water <unk> . Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion . Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function , allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater . 
 = = = Scales = = = 
 The scales of fish originate from the mesoderm ( skin ) ; they may be similar in structure to teeth . 
 = = = Sensory and nervous system = = = 
 = = = = Central nervous system = = = = 
 Fish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates , typically one @-@ fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal . However , some fish have relatively large brains , most notably <unk> and sharks , which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials . 
 Fish brains are divided into several regions . At the front are the olfactory lobes , a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves . The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell , such as hagfish , sharks , and catfish . Behind the olfactory lobes is the two @-@ lobed telencephalon , the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates . In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction . Together these structures form the forebrain . 
 Connecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the diencephalon ( in the diagram , this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible ) . The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis . The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon . This structure detects light , maintains circadian rhythms , and controls color changes . 
 The midbrain or mesencephalon contains the two optic lobes . These are very large in species that hunt by sight , such as rainbow trout and cichlids . 
 The hindbrain or metencephalon is particularly involved in swimming and balance . The cerebellum is a single @-@ lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain . <unk> and lampreys have relatively small <unk> , while the <unk> cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense . 
 The brain stem or <unk> is the brain 's posterior . As well as controlling some muscles and body organs , in bony fish at least , the brain stem governs respiration and osmoregulation . 
 = = = = Sense organs = = = = 
 Most fish possess highly developed sense organs . Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human 's ( see vision in fishes ) . Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell . Although they have ears , many fish may not hear very well . Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system , which detects gentle currents and vibrations , and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey . Some fish , such as catfish and sharks , have organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of <unk> . Other fish , like the South American electric fishes <unk> , can produce weak electric currents , which they use in navigation and social communication . 
 Fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols . Fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination . 
 = = = = = Vision = = = = = 
 Vision is an important sensory system for most species of fish . Fish eyes are similar to those of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals , but have a more spherical lens . Their retinas generally have both rods and cones ( for <unk> and <unk> vision ) , and most species have colour vision . Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light . Amongst jawless fish , the lamprey has well @-@ developed eyes , while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots . Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment , for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment . 
 = = = = = Hearing = = = = = 
 Hearing is an important sensory system for most species of fish . Fish sense sound using their lateral lines and their ears . 
 = = = = Capacity for pain = = = = 
 Experiments done by William <unk> provide evidence that fish have pain and fear responses . For instance , in <unk> 's experiments , toadfish <unk> when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode . 
 In 2003 , Scottish scientists at the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with pain in other animals . Bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks , which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain , similar to what mammals would do . Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns . 
 Professor James D. Rose of the University of Wyoming claimed the study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess " conscious awareness , particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours " . Rose argues that since fish brains are so different from human brains , fish are probably not conscious in the manner humans are , so that reactions similar to human reactions to pain instead have other causes . Rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a neocortex . However , animal behaviorist Temple Grandin argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because " different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions . " 
 Animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible suffering of fish caused by angling . Some countries , such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing , and the British RSPCA now formally <unk> individuals who are cruel to fish . 
 = = = Muscular system = = = 
 Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone . These contractions form S @-@ shaped curves that move down the body . As each curve reaches the back fin , backward force is applied to the water , and in conjunction with the fins , moves the fish forward . The fish 's fins function like an airplane 's flaps . Fins also increase the tail 's surface area , increasing speed . The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water . Since body tissue is denser than water , fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink . Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Although most fish are exclusively ectothermic , there are exceptions . 
 Certain species of fish maintain elevated body temperatures . <unk> teleosts ( bony fish ) are all in the suborder <unk> and include the billfishes , tunas , and one species of " primitive " mackerel ( <unk> melampus ) . All sharks in the family Lamnidae – shortfin mako , long fin mako , white , porbeagle , and salmon shark – are endothermic , and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae ( thresher sharks ) . The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish , which warm only their eyes and brain , to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20 ° C above ambient water temperatures . See also gigantothermy . <unk> , though metabolically costly , is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength , higher rates of central nervous system processing , and higher rates of digestion . 
 = = = Reproductive system = = = 
 Fish reproductive organs include testicles and ovaries . In most species , gonads are paired organs of similar size , which can be partially or totally fused . There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness . 
 In terms of spermatogonia distribution , the structure of teleosts testes has two types : in the most common , spermatogonia occur all along the seminiferous tubules , while in <unk> fish they are confined to the distal portion of these structures . Fish can present cystic or semi @-@ cystic spermatogenesis in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules lumen . 
 Fish ovaries may be of three types : gymnovarian , secondary gymnovarian or <unk> . In the first type , the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium , then through the oviduct and are eliminated . Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct . In the third type , the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct . <unk> are the primitive condition found in lungfish , sturgeon , and bowfin . <unk> characterize most teleosts , where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct . Secondary <unk> are found in salmonids and a few other teleosts . 
 <unk> development in teleosts fish varies according to the group , and the determination of <unk> dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization processes . Changes in the nucleus , <unk> , and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process . 
 <unk> follicles are structures formed after oocyte release ; they do not have endocrine function , present a wide irregular lumen , and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells . A degenerative process called follicular atresia <unk> <unk> oocytes not spawned . This process can also occur , but less frequently , in oocytes in other development stages . 
 Some fish , like the California <unk> , are hermaphrodites , having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or , as in hamlets , have them simultaneously . 
 Over 97 % of all known fish are oviparous , that is , the eggs develop outside the mother 's body . Examples of oviparous fish include salmon , goldfish , cichlids , tuna , and eels . In the majority of these species , fertilisation takes place outside the mother 's body , with the male and female fish shedding their gametes into the surrounding water . However , a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization , with the male using some sort of intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female , most notably the oviparous sharks , such as the horn shark , and oviparous rays , such as skates . In these cases , the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fins known as claspers . 
 Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column . The eggs have an average diameter of 1 millimetre ( 0 @.@ 039 in ) . 
 The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called larvae . They are usually poorly formed , carry a large yolk sac ( for nourishment ) , and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens . The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short ( usually only several weeks ) , and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure ( a process termed metamorphosis ) to become juveniles . During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey , a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density , starving many larvae . 
 In ovoviviparous fish the eggs develop inside the mother 's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother , depending instead on the yolk . Each embryo develops in its own egg . Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include guppies , angel sharks , and coelacanths . 
 Some species of fish are viviparous . In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos . Typically , viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother 's blood supply with that of the embryo . Examples of viviparous fish include the surf @-@ perches , <unk> , and lemon shark . Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy , in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother . This has been observed primarily among sharks , such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle , but is known for a few bony fish as well , such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii . Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary , in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings . This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks , such as the grey nurse shark , but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii . 
 <unk> commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as <unk> . 
 = = Diseases = = 
 Like other animals , fish suffer from diseases and parasites . To prevent disease they have a variety of defenses . Non @-@ specific defenses include the skin and scales , as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms . If pathogens breach these defenses , fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens . Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish 's body , i.e. , an immune response . In recent years , vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish , for example <unk> vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi . 
 Some species use cleaner fish to remove external parasites . The best known of these are the <unk> cleaner wrasses of the genus Labroides found on coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific oceans . These small fish maintain so @-@ called " cleaning stations " where other fish congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaners . Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of fish groups , including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus , Etroplus maculatus , the cleaner , and the much larger Etroplus <unk> . 
 = = = Immune system = = = 
 Immune organs vary by type of fish . In the jawless fish ( lampreys and hagfish ) , true lymphoid organs are absent . These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells . For example , erythrocytes , macrophages and plasma cells are produced in the anterior kidney ( or <unk> ) and some areas of the gut ( where granulocytes mature . ) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish . Cartilaginous fish ( sharks and rays ) have a more advanced immune system . They have three specialized organs that are unique to Chondrichthyes ; the <unk> organs ( lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone ) that surround the gonads , the <unk> 's organ within the walls of their esophagus , and a spiral valve in their intestine . These organs house typical immune cells ( granulocytes , lymphocytes and plasma cells ) . They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well @-@ developed spleen ( their most important immune organ ) where various lymphocytes , plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored . <unk> fish ( sturgeons , paddlefish , and bichirs ) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the meninges ( membranes surrounding the central nervous system . ) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes , reticular cells and a small number of macrophages . The chondrostean kidney is an important <unk> organ ; where erythrocytes , granulocytes , lymphocytes and macrophages develop . 
 Like chondrostean fish , the major immune tissues of bony fish ( or <unk> ) include the kidney ( especially the anterior kidney ) , which houses many different immune cells . In addition , teleost fish possess a thymus , spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues ( e.g. in the skin , gills , gut and gonads ) . Much like the mammalian immune system , teleost erythrocytes , neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus . In 2006 , a lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish , the zebrafish . Although not confirmed as yet , this system presumably will be where naive ( unstimulated ) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen . 
 B and T lymphocytes bearing immunoglobulins and T cell receptors , respectively , are found in all jawed fishes . Indeed , the adaptive immune system as a whole evolved in an ancestor of all jawed vertebrate . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The 2006 IUCN Red List names 1 @,@ 173 fish species that are threatened with extinction . Included are species such as Atlantic cod , Devil 's Hole pupfish , coelacanths , and great white sharks . Because fish live underwater they are more difficult to study than terrestrial animals and plants , and information about fish populations is often lacking . However , freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small water bodies . For example , the Devil 's Hole pupfish occupies only a single 3 by 6 metres ( 10 by 20 ft ) pool . 
 = = = Overfishing = = = 
 Overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such as cod and tuna . Overfishing eventually causes population ( known as stock ) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed . Such commercial extinction does not mean that the species is extinct , merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery . 
 One well @-@ studied example of fishery collapse is the Pacific sardine <unk> sagax <unk> fishery off the California coast . From a 1937 peak of 790 @,@ 000 long tons ( 800 @,@ 000 t ) the catch steadily declined to only 24 @,@ 000 long tons ( 24 @,@ 000 t ) in 1968 , after which the fishery was no longer economically viable . 
 The main tension between fisheries science and the fishing industry is that the two groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing . In places such as Scotland , Newfoundland , and Alaska the fishing industry is a major employer , so governments are predisposed to support it . On the other hand , scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection , warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years . 
 = = = Habitat destruction = = = 
 A key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution , the building of dams , removal of water for use by humans , and the introduction of exotic species . An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon , a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity . 
 = = = Exotic species = = = 
 Introduction of non @-@ native species has occurred in many habitats . One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s . Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake 's 500 endemic cichlid species . Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes , but others are probably extinct . Carp , snakeheads , tilapia , European perch , brown trout , rainbow trout , and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments . 
 = = Importance to humans = = 
 = = = Economic importance = = = 
 Throughout history , humans have utilized fish as a food source . Historically and today , most fish protein has come by means of catching wild fish . However , aquaculture , or fish farming , which has been practiced since about 3 @,@ 500 <unk> in China , is becoming increasingly important in many nations . Overall , about one @-@ sixth of the world 's protein is estimated to be provided by fish . That proportion is considerably elevated in some developing nations and regions heavily dependent on the sea . In a similar manner , fish have been tied to trade . 
 Catching fish for the purpose of food or sport is known as fishing , while the organized effort by humans to catch fish is called a fishery . Fisheries are a huge global business and provide income for millions of people . The annual yield from all fisheries worldwide is about 154 million tons , with popular species including herring , cod , anchovy , tuna , flounder , and salmon . However , the term fishery is broadly applied , and includes more organisms than just fish , such as mollusks and crustaceans , which are often called " fish " when used as food . 
 = = = Recreation = = = 
 Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food , appearing in cave art , being raised as ornamental fish in ponds , and displayed in aquariums in homes , offices , or public settings . 
 Recreational fishing is fishing for pleasure or competition ; it can be contrasted with commercial fishing , which is fishing for profit . The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod , reel , line , hooks and any one of a wide range of baits . Angling is a method of fishing , specifically the practice of catching fish by means of an " angle " ( hook ) . Anglers must select the right hook , cast accurately , and retrieve at the right speed while considering water and weather conditions , species , fish response , time of the day , and other factors . 
 = = = Culture = = = 
 Fish feature prominently in art and literature , in movies such as Finding Nemo and books such as The Old Man and the Sea . Large fish , particularly sharks , have frequently been the subject of horror movies and thrillers , most notably the novel Jaws , which spawned a series of films of the same name that in turn inspired similar films or parodies such as Shark Tale and Snakehead Terror . Piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as Piranha ; however , contrary to popular belief , the red @-@ bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger species that is unlikely to harm humans . In the Book of Jonah a " great fish " swallowed Jonah the Prophet . Legends of half @-@ human , half @-@ fish mermaids have featured in folklore , like the stories of Hans Christian Andersen . 
 Fish themes have symbolic significance in many religions . The fish is used often as a symbol by Christians to represent Jesus , or Christianity in general ; the gospels also refer to " fishers of men " and feeding the multitude . In the <unk> of Buddhism the fish symbolize happiness as they have complete freedom of movement in the water . Often drawn in the form of carp which are regarded in the Orient as sacred on account of their elegant beauty , size and life @-@ span . Among the deities said to take the form of a fish are Ika @-@ Roa of the Polynesians , Dagon of various ancient Semitic peoples , the shark @-@ gods of Hawaiʻi and Matsya of the Hindus . 
 The astrological symbol Pisces is based on a constellation of the same name , but there is also a second fish constellation in the night sky , Piscis Austrinus . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 = = = Shoal or school = = = 
 A random assemblage of fish merely using some localised resource such as food or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation . When fish come together in an interactive , social grouping , then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending on the degree of organisation . A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour , such as swimming speed , so that it remains close to the other members of the group . Schools of fish are much more tightly organised , synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction . Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages . 
 Examples : 
 <unk> congregating at lekking sites form an aggregation . 
 Many minnows and characins form shoals . 
 <unk> , herrings and silversides are classic examples of schooling fish . 
 While the words " school " and " shoal " have different meanings within biology , they are often treated as synonyms by non @-@ specialists , with speakers of British English using " shoal " to describe any grouping of fish , and speakers of American English often using " school " just as loosely . 
 = = = Fish or fishes = = = 
 Though often used interchangeably , in biology these words have different meanings . Fish is used as a singular noun , or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species . Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups . Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish . But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species , it would be said to contain three fishes . The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples . 
 = = = Finfish = = = 
 In biology , the term fish is most strictly used to describe any animal with a backbone that has gills throughout life and has limbs , if any , in the shape of fins . Many types of aquatic animals with common names ending in " fish " are not fish in this sense ; examples include shellfish , cuttlefish , starfish , crayfish and jellyfish . In earlier times , even biologists did not make a distinction — sixteenth century natural historians classified also seals , whales , amphibians , crocodiles , even hippopotamuses , as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates , as fish . 
 In fisheries , the term fish is used as a collective term , and includes mollusks , crustaceans and any aquatic animal which is harvested . 
 The strict biological definition of a fish , above , is sometimes called a true fish . True fish are also referred to as finfish or fin fish to distinguish them from other aquatic life harvested in fisheries or aquaculture . 
 = Peter Heywood = 
 Peter Heywood ( 6 June 1772 – 10 February 1831 ) was a British naval officer who was on board HMS Bounty during the mutiny of 28 April 1789 . He was later captured in Tahiti , tried and condemned to death as a mutineer , but subsequently pardoned . He resumed his naval career and eventually retired with the rank of post @-@ captain , after 29 years of honourable service . 
 The son of a prominent Isle of Man family with strong naval connections , Heywood joined Bounty under Lieutenant William Bligh at the age of 15 and , although unranked was given the privileges of a junior officer . Bounty left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport breadfruit from the Pacific , and arrived in Tahiti late in 1788 . Relations between Bligh and certain of his officers , notably Fletcher Christian , became strained , and worsened during the five months that Bounty remained in Tahiti . 
 Shortly after the ship began its homeward voyage Christian and his discontented followers seized Bligh and took control of the vessel . Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat ; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty . Later , he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti , while Bounty sailed on , ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island . Bligh , after an epic open @-@ boat journey , eventually reached England , where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny 's prime instigators . In 1791 Heywood and his companions were captured in Tahiti by the search vessel HMS Pandora , and held in irons for transportation to England . The subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful ; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef , four of Heywood 's fellow prisoners were drowned , and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive . 
 In September 1792 Heywood was court @-@ martialed and with five others was sentenced to hang . However , the court recommended mercy for Heywood , and King George III pardoned him . In a rapid change of fortune he found himself favoured by senior officers , and after the resumption of his career received a series of promotions that gave him his first command at the age of 27 and made him a post @-@ captain at 31 . He remained in the navy until 1816 , building a respectable career as a hydrographer , and then enjoyed a long and peaceful retirement . The extent of Heywood 's true guilt in the mutiny has been clouded by contradictory statements and possible false testimony . During his trial powerful family connections worked on his behalf , and he later benefited from the Christian family 's generally fruitful efforts to demean Bligh 's character and present the mutiny as an understandable reaction to an unbearable tyranny . Contemporary press reports , and more recent commentators , have contrasted Heywood 's pardon with the fate of his fellow prisoners who were hanged , all lower @-@ deck sailors without wealth or family influence . 
 = = Family background and early life = = 
 Peter Heywood was born in 1772 at The Nunnery , in Douglas , Isle of Man . He was the fifth of the 11 children ( six boys and five girls ) of Peter John Heywood and his wife Elizabeth Spedding . The Heywood ancestry can be traced back to the 12th century ; a prominent forebear was Peter " <unk> " Heywood , who arrested Guy Fawkes after the 1605 plot to blow up the English parliament . On his mother 's side Peter was distantly related to Fletcher Christian 's family , which had been established on the Isle of Man for centuries . In 1773 , when Peter was a year old , Peter John Heywood was forced by a financial crisis to sell The Nunnery and leave the island . The family lived for several years on the British mainland in Whitehaven before the father 's appointment as agent for the Duke of Atholl 's Manx properties brought them back to Douglas . 
 There was a tradition in the family of naval and military service , and in 1786 , when he was 14 , Heywood left St Bees School on the mainland to join HMS Powerful , a harbour @-@ bound training vessel at Plymouth . In August 1787 Heywood was offered a berth on the Bounty , for an extended cruise to the Pacific Ocean under the command of Lieutenant William Bligh . Heywood 's recommendation came from Richard Betham , a family friend who was also Bligh 's father @-@ in @-@ law . The Heywood family at this time was in deep financial trouble , Peter John Heywood having been dismissed by the Duke for gross mismanagement and embezzlement of funds . Betham wrote to Bligh : " his Family have fallen into a great deal of Distress on account of their father losing the Duke of Atholl 's business " , and urged Bligh not to desert them in their adversity . Bligh was happy to oblige his father @-@ in @-@ law , and invited the young Heywood to stay with him in Deptford while the ship was prepared for the forthcoming voyage . 
 = = On HMS Bounty = = 
 = = = Outward journey = = = 
 Bounty 's mission was to collect breadfruit plants from Tahiti , for transportation to the West Indies as a new source of food for the slave plantations . Bligh , a skilled navigator , had travelled to Tahiti in 1776 , as Captain James Cook 's sailing master during the explorer 's final voyage . Bounty was a small vessel , 91 feet ( 28 m ) in overall length , with a complement of 46 men crammed into limited accommodation . Heywood was one of several " young gentlemen " aboard ship who were mustered as able seamen but ate and slept with their social equals in the cockpit . His distant kinsman Fletcher Christian served as master 's mate on the voyage . Bligh 's orders were to enter the Pacific by rounding Cape Horn . After collecting sufficient breadfruit plants from the Tahitian islands he was to sail westward , through the Endeavour Strait and across the Indian Ocean . Entering the Atlantic he would continue on to the West Indies , incidentally completing a circumnavigation . 
 Bounty left London on 15 October 1787 , and after being held at Spithead awaiting final sailing orders was further delayed by bad weather ; it was 23 December before the ship was finally away . This long hiatus caused Bounty to arrive at Cape Horn much later in the season than planned and to encounter very severe weather . Unable to make progress against westerly gales and enormous seas , Bligh finally turned the ship and headed east . He would now have to take the alternative , much longer route to the Pacific , sailing first to Cape Town and then south of Australia and New Zealand , before working northwards to Tahiti . 
 Following its new route , Bounty reached Cape Town on 24 May 1788 . Here , Heywood wrote a long letter to his family describing the voyage to date , with vivid descriptions of life at sea . Initially , Heywood relates , sailing had been " in the most pleasurable weather imaginable " . In describing the attempts to round Cape Horn he writes : " I suppose there never were seas , in any part of the known world , to compare with those we met ... for height , and length of swell ; the oldest seamen on board never saw anything to equal that ... " Bligh 's decision to turn east was , Heywood records , " to the great joy of everyone on board " . Historian Greg Dening records a story , unmentioned in Heywood 's letter , that at the height of the Cape Horn storms Bligh had punished Heywood for some minor wrongdoing by ordering him to climb the mast and to " stay there beyond the point of all endurance " ; this , Dening concedes , was possibly a later fabrication to discredit Bligh . 
 = = = In Tahiti = = = 
 Bounty sailed from Cape Town on 1 July , reached Tasmania on 19 August , and arrived at Matavai Bay , Tahiti , on 26 October . The latter stages of this voyage , however , saw signs of trouble between Bligh and his officers and crew ; rows and disagreements grew steadily more frequent . On arrival , Heywood and Christian were assigned to a shore camp which would act as a nursery for the breadfruit plants . They would live here throughout the Tahiti sojourn , a " situation of comfort and privilege " which , according to historian Richard Hough , was much envied by those required to spend their nights on the ship . Whether crew were ashore or on board , however , duties during Bounty 's five months ' stay in Tahiti were relatively light . Some men took regular partners from the native women , while others led promiscuous lives ; both Christian and Heywood are listed among the officers and men treated for venereal infections . 
 Despite the relaxed atmosphere , relations between Bligh and his men , and particularly between Bligh and Christian , continued to deteriorate . Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain — often in front of the crew and the native Tahitians — for real or imagined slackness , while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment . <unk> , rarely administered during the outward voyage , now became a common occurrence ; as a consequence , three men deserted the ship . They were quickly recaptured , and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood . Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot , which they strenuously denied ; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them . 
 As the date for departure from Tahiti grew closer , Bligh 's outbursts against his officers became more frequent . One witness reported that " Whatever fault was found , Mr Christian was sure to bear the brunt . " Tensions rose among the men , who faced the prospect of a long and dangerous voyage that would take them through the uncharted Endeavour Strait , followed by many months of hard sailing . Bligh was impatient to be away , but in Hough 's words he " failed to anticipate how his company would react to the severity and austerity of life at sea ... after five dissolute , hedonistic months at Tahiti " . On 5 April , Bounty finally weighed anchor and made for the open sea . 
 = = Mutiny = = 
 = = = Seizure of Bounty = = = 
 For three weeks , Bounty sailed westward , and early on 28 April was lying off the island of Tofua in the Friendly Islands ( Tonga ) . Christian was officer of the watch ; Bligh 's behaviour towards him had grown increasingly hostile , and Christian was now prepared to take over the ship , with the help of a group of armed seamen who were willing to follow him . Shortly after 5 : 15 am Bligh was seized and brought on deck , naked from the waist down , wearing only his nightshirt , and with his hands bound . There followed hours of confusion as the majority of the crew sought to grasp the situation and decide how they should react . Finally , at about 10 am , Bligh and 18 loyalists were placed in the ship 's launch , a 23 @-@ foot ( 7 m ) open boat , with minimal supplies and navigation instruments , and cast adrift . Heywood was among those who remained on board . 
 Not all the 25 men who remained on Bounty were mutineers ; Bligh 's launch was overloaded , and some who stayed with the ship did so under duress . " Never fear , lads , I 'll do you justice if ever I reach England " , Bligh is reported as saying . With regard to Heywood , however , Bligh was convinced that the young man was as guilty as Christian . Bligh 's first detailed comments on the mutiny are in a letter to his wife Betsy , in which he names Heywood as " one of the ringleaders " , adding : " I have now reason to curse the day I ever knew a Christian or a Heywood or indeed a <unk> [ sic ] man . Bligh 's later official account to the Admiralty lists Heywood with Christian , Edward Young and George Stewart as the mutiny 's leaders , describing Heywood as a young man of abilities for whom he had felt a particular regard . To the Heywood family Bligh wrote : " His baseness is beyond all description . " 
 Members of the crew would later provide conflicting accounts of Heywood 's actions during the mutiny . Boatswain William Cole testified that Heywood had been detained on the ship against his will . Ship 's carpenter William Purcell thought that Heywood 's ambiguous behaviour during the critical hours — he had been seen briefly holding a cutlass — was due to his youth and the excitement of the moment , and that he had no hand in the uprising itself . On the other hand , Midshipman John Hallett reported that Bligh , with a bayonet at his breast and his hands tied , had addressed a remark to Heywood who had " laughed , turned round and walked away " . Another midshipman , Thomas Hayward , claimed he had asked Heywood his intentions and been told by the latter that he would remain with the ship , from which Hayward assumed that his messmate had sided with the mutineers . 
 After the departure of Bligh 's launch , Christian turned Bounty eastward in search of a remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle . He had in mind the island of Tubuai , 300 miles south of Tahiti , partly mapped by Cook . Christian intended to pick up women , male servants and livestock from Tahiti , to help establish the settlement . As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai , Bligh 's launch , overcoming many dangers and hardships , made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang ( now Kupang ) , on Timor , on 14 June 1789 . Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny , while awaiting a ship to take him back to England . 
 = = = Fugitive = = = 
 A month 's sailing brought Bounty to Tubuai on 28 May 1789 . Despite a hostile reception from the island 's natives Christian spent several days surveying the land and selecting a site for a fort before taking Bounty on to Tahiti . When they reached Matavai Bay Christian concocted a story that he , Bligh and Captain Cook were founding a new settlement at Aitutaki . Cook 's name ensured generous gifts of livestock and other goods , and on 16 June the well @-@ provisioned Bounty sailed back to Tubuai with nearly 30 Tahitians , some of whom had been taken aboard by deception . The attempt to establish a colony on Tubuai was unsuccessful ; the repeated raids by the mutineers for " wives " and the near @-@ mutinous dissatisfaction of the duped Tahitians wrecked Christian 's plans . On 18 September Bounty sailed back to Matavai Bay for the final time . Heywood and 15 others now decided that they would remain in Tahiti and risk the consequences of discovery , while Christian , with eight mutineers and a number of Tahitian men and women , took off in Bounty for an unrevealed destination . Before departing , Christian left messages for his family with Heywood , recounting the story of the mutiny and emphasising that he alone was responsible . 
 On Tahiti Heywood and his companions set about organising their lives . The largest group , led by James Morrison , began building a schooner , to be named Resolution after Cook 's ship . Matthew Thompson and former master @-@ at @-@ arms Charles Churchill chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives which ended in the violent deaths of both . Heywood preferred quiet domesticity in a small house with a Tahitian wife , studying the Tahitian language and fathering a daughter . Over a period of 18 months he gradually adopted native manners of dress , and was heavily tattooed around the body . Heywood later explained : " I was tattooed not to gratify my own desires , but theirs " , adding that in Tahiti a man without tattoos was an outcast . " I always made it a maxim when I was in Rome to act as Rome did . " 
 What Dening describes as an " <unk> existence " ended on 23 March 1791 , with the arrival of the search ship HMS Pandora . Heywood 's first reaction to the ship 's appearance was , he later wrote , " the utmost joy " . As the ship anchored he rode out in a canoe to identify himself . However , his reception , like that of the others who came aboard voluntarily , was frosty . Captain Edward Edwards , Pandora 's commander , made no distinctions among the former Bounty men ; all became prisoners , and were manacled and taken below . 
 = = Prisoner = = 
 = = = Pandora voyage = = = 
 Within a few days all the 14 surviving fugitives in Tahiti had surrendered or been captured . Among Pandora 's officers was former Bounty midshipman Thomas Hayward . Heywood 's hopes that his former shipmate would verify his innocence were quickly dashed . Hayward , " ... like all <unk> raised a little in life , received us very coolly , and pretended ignorance of our affairs . " Pandora remained at Tahiti for five weeks while Captain Edwards tried without success to obtain information on Bounty 's whereabouts . A cell was built on Pandora 's quarterdeck , a structure known as " Pandora 's Box " where the prisoners , legs in irons and wrists in handcuffs , were to be confined for almost five months . Heywood wrote : " The heat ... was so intense that the sweat frequently ran in streams to the scuppers , and produced maggots in a short time ... and the two necessary tubs which were constantly kept in place helped to render our situation truly disagreeable . " 
 Pandora left Tahiti on 8 May 1791 to search for Christian and the Bounty among the thousands of southern Pacific islands . Apart from a few spars — which had probably floated from Tubuai — discovered at Palmerston Island ( <unk> ) , no traces of the ship could be found . Physical attacks from natives were frequent ; early in August Edwards abandoned the search and headed for the Dutch East Indies via the Torres Strait . Knowledge of these waters and the surrounding reefs was minimal ; on 29 August the ship ran aground on the outer Great Barrier Reef and began to fill with water . Three of the prisoners in " Pandora 's Box " were let out and ordered to assist the crew at the pumps . In the subsequent struggle to save the ship the rest of the men in " Pandora 's Box " were ignored as the regular crew went about their efforts to prevent the ship from foundering . At dawn it was clear that their efforts were in vain ; the officers agreed that the vessel could not be saved and orders were then given to abandon ship . The armourer was ordered into the " box " to knock off the remaining prisoners ' leg irons and shackles ; however , the ship sank before he had finished . Heywood , stripped naked , was one of the last to get out of the cell ; four prisoners , including Heywood 's best friend George Stewart , were drowned , as were 31 of the regular crew . The 99 survivors , including ten prisoners , recovered on a nearby island where they stayed for two nights before embarking on an open @-@ boat journey which largely followed Bligh 's course of two years earlier . The prisoners were mostly kept bound hand and foot on the slow passage to Coupang , which they reached on 17 September . 
 Throughout this long ordeal Heywood somehow managed to hang on to his prayer book , and used it to jot down details of dates , places and events during his captivity . He recorded that at Coupang he and his fellow @-@ prisoners were placed in the stocks and confined in the fortress before being sent to Batavia ( now Jakarta ) on the first leg of the voyage back to England . During a seven @-@ week stay in Batavia confined aboard a Dutch East India Company ship , most of the prisoners , including Heywood , were allowed on deck only twice . On 25 December 1791 they were taken aboard a Dutch ship , <unk> , for passage to Europe via Cape Town . Still in the charge of Captain Edwards , the prisoners were kept in irons for most of the way . At the Cape they were eventually transferred to a British warship , HMS Gorgon , which set sail for England on 5 April 1792 . On 19 June the ship arrived in Portsmouth where the prisoners were moved to the guardship HMS Hector . 
 = = = Portsmouth = = = 
 Bligh had landed in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim , and was quickly promoted to post @-@ captain . In the following months he wrote his account of the mutiny , and on 22 October was honourably acquitted at court martial of responsibility for the Bounty 's loss . Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition , which left London on 3 August of that year , before any news of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London . Bligh would be gone for more than two years , and would thus be absent from the court martial proceedings that awaited the returned mutineers . 
 Following Heywood 's arrival in Portsmouth his family sought help from their wide circle of influential friends , and set out to secure the best available legal counsel . Most active on Heywood 's behalf was his older sister Hester ( " Nessy " ) , who gave her brother unqualified support , writing to him on 3 June : " If the transactions of that day were as Mr. Bligh represented them , such is my conviction of your worth and honor that I will without hesitation stake my life on your innocence . If on the contrary you were concerned in such a conspiracy against your commander , I shall be firmly convinced that his conduct was the occasion of it . " Heywood sent his personal narrative of the mutiny to the Earl of Chatham , who was First Lord of the Admiralty and brother to the prime minister , William Pitt . This was a step Heywood subsequently regretted ; he had not consulted his lawyers , and his narrative contained statements that Heywood later rescinded on the grounds that they were " the errors of an imperfect recollection " . On 8 June Nessy was advised by her and Heywood 's uncle , Captain Thomas Pasley , that on the basis of information from the returned Pandora crew " ... your brother appears by all account to be the greatest culprit of all , Christian alone excepted ... I have no hope of his not being condemned . " Later , however , Pasley was able to offer some comfort ; Captain Montagu of Hector , where Heywood was held , was Pasley 's " particular friend " . By chance another Heywood naval relative by marriage , Captain Albemarle Bertie , was in Portsmouth Harbour with his ship HMS Edgar , moored alongside Hector . Mrs Bertie , and Edgar 's officers , were frequent visitors to Heywood , bringing gifts of food , clothing and other comforts . 
 Pasley secured the services of Aaron Graham , an experienced and clever advocate , to direct Heywood 's legal strategy . Between June and September Heywood and his sister exchanged a stream of letters and ardent poems ; Nessy 's final letter , just before the court martial , exhorted : " May the Almighty Providence , whose tender care has hitherto preserved you , be still your bountiful Protector ! May he instil into the hearts of your judges every sentiment of justice , generosity and compassion ... and may you at length be restored to us . " 
 = = = Court martial = = = 
 The court martial opened on 12 September 1792 aboard HMS Duke in Portsmouth Harbour . Accused with Heywood were Joseph Coleman , Thomas McIntosh and Charles Norman , all of whom had been exonerated in Bligh 's account and could confidently expect acquittal , as could Michael Byrne , the nearly blind ship 's fiddler . The other accused were James Morrison , Thomas Burkitt , Thomas Ellison , John Millward and William Muspratt . The court martial board was presided over by Lord Hood , naval commander @-@ in @-@ chief at Portsmouth , and included Pasley 's friend George Montagu and Heywood 's relative by marriage , Albemarle Bertie . 
 The testimonies of the boatswain Cole , the carpenter Purcell , and the sailing master John Fryer were not unfavourable towards Heywood . However , Thomas Hayward 's declared belief that Heywood was with the mutineers was damaging , as was the evidence of John Hallett concerning Heywood 's alleged insolence in laughing and turning away from the captive Bligh — though Hallett had previously written to Nessy Heywood professing total ignorance of the part Heywood had played in the mutiny . 
 Heywood opened his defence on 17 September with a long prepared statement read by one of his lawyers . It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament : to be even accused of mutiny was to " appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance " . His case rested on a series of arguments which , as historian Caroline Alexander points out , are not wholly consistent . First , Heywood pleaded his " extreme youth and inexperience " as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat , insisting that " ... I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my <unk> , Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter , tho ' he had been many years at Sea , yet , when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command , that he actually shed tears . " Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard Bounty : Bligh 's launch was overloaded , and its destruction would be assured " by the least addition to their Number " . Finally , Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped : " ... on hearing it suggested that I should be deem 'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship , I went down directly , and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat , which at that time I meant to do but was afterwards prevented . " 
 Under further questioning , Cole confirmed his belief that Heywood had been detained against his will . William Peckover , Bounty 's gunnery officer , affirmed that if he had stayed aboard the ship in the hope of retaking her , he would have looked to Heywood for assistance . Witnesses from the Pandora attested that Heywood had surrendered himself voluntarily , and that he had been fully cooperative in providing information . On the issue of his alleged laughing at Bligh 's predicament , Heywood managed to cast doubts on Hallett 's testimony , asking how Hallett had managed " to <unk> the muscles of a man 's countenance " at some distance and during the <unk> @-@ burly of a mutiny . Heywood concluded his defence with what Alexander terms an " audacious " assertion that had Bligh been present in court he would have " exculpated me from the least disrespect " . 
 = = = Verdict and sentences = = = 
 On 18 September Lord Hood announced the court 's verdicts . As expected , Coleman , McIntosh , Norman and Byrne were acquitted . Heywood and the other five were found guilty of the charge of mutiny , and were ordered to suffer death by hanging . Lord Hood added that " in consideration of various circumstances , the court did humbly and most earnestly recommend the said Peter Heywood and James Morrison to His Majesty 's Royal Mercy . " Heywood 's family were quickly reassured by the lawyer Aaron Graham that the young man 's life was safe and that he would soon be free . 
 As the weeks passed , Heywood calmly occupied himself by resuming his studies of the Tahitian language . Meanwhile the family — Nessy in particular — busied itself on his behalf , and another plea was made to the Earl of Chatham , in heart @-@ rending terms . Shortly afterwards came the first indication that a royal pardon was in the offing , and on 26 October , on Hector 's quarterdeck , this was formally read to Heywood and Morrison by Captain Montagu . Heywood responded with a short statement that ended : " I receive with gratitude my Sovereign 's mercy , for which my future life will be faithfully devoted to his service . " According to a Dutch newspaper which reported the case , his contrition was accompanied by a " flood of tears " . William Muspratt , the only other of the accused to employ legal counsel , was reprieved on a legal technicality and pardoned in February 1793 . 
 Three days later , aboard HMS Brunswick , Millward , Burkitt and Ellison were hanged from the yardarms . Dening calls them " a humble remnant on which to wreak vengeance " . There was some unease expressed in the press , a suspicion that " money had bought the lives of some , and others fell sacrifice to their poverty . " A report that Heywood was heir to a large fortune was unfounded ; nevertheless , Dening asserts that " in the end it was class or relations or patronage that made the difference . " Some accounts claim that the condemned trio continued to protest their innocence until the last moment , while others speak of their " manly firmness that ... was the admiration of all " . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 On the specific recommendation of Lord Hood , who had offered the young man his personal patronage , Heywood resumed his naval career as a midshipman aboard his uncle Thomas Pasley 's ship HMS Bellerophon . In September 1793 he was summoned by Lord Howe , commander of the Channel Fleet , to serve on HMS Queen Charlotte , the fleet 's flagship . Hough observes that a pardon , followed by promotion , for one of Bligh 's chief targets was " a public rebuke to the absent captain , and everyone recognised it as such " . Although Bligh had departed on his second breadfruit expedition in August 1791 as a national hero , the court martial had revealed damaging evidence of his erratic and overbearing behaviour . The families of Heywood and Christian , noting the leniency that had acquitted four and pardoned three of the ten accused , began their own campaigns for vindication , and for revenge on Bligh . When Bligh returned in August 1793 he found that opinion had turned sharply against him . Lord Chatham , at the Admiralty , refused to receive his report or even see him — although Nathaniel Portlock , Bligh 's lieutenant , was given a meeting . Bligh was then left unemployed , on half @-@ pay , for 19 months before his next assignment . 
 Shortly after his release , Heywood had written to Edward Christian , Fletcher 's older brother , that he would " endeavour to prove that your brother was not that vile wretch , void of all gratitude ... but , on the contrary , a most worthy character ... beloved by all ( except one , whose ill report is his greatest praise ) " . This statement , published immediately after Heywood 's pardon in a local Whitehaven newspaper as an open letter to Edward Christian , contradicted the respect Heywood had accorded Bligh in the courtroom , and , in turn , it led to the publication in late 1794 of Edward Christian 's Appendix to the court martial proceedings . Presented as an account of the " real causes and circumstances of that Unhappy Transaction " , the Appendix was said by the press to " palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers , and to criminate Captain Bligh " . In the controversy that followed , Bligh 's rebuttals could not silence doubts as to his own conduct , and his position was further undermined when William Peckover , a Bligh loyalist , confirmed that the allegations in the Appendix were substantially accurate .

 = = = Early stages = = = 
 Heywood served on Queen Charlotte until March 1795 , and was aboard her when the French fleet was defeated at Ushant on 1 June 1794 , the occasion known as the " Glorious First of June " . In August 1794 he was promoted acting lieutenant . In March 1795 , doubts about his eligibility as a convicted mutineer for further promotion were set aside and his advancement to full lieutenant 's rank was approved , despite his lacking the stated minimum of six years ' service at sea . Among those who supported the promotion was Captain Hugh Cloberry Christian , a relative of Fletcher Christian . 
 In January 1796 Heywood was appointed third lieutenant to HMS Fox and sailed with her to the East Indies . He was to remain in this station for nine years . By the end of 1796 he was Fox 's first lieutenant , and remained so until mid @-@ 1798 when he transferred to HMS Suffolk . On 17 May 1799 Heywood was given his first command , HMS Amboyna , a brig @-@ of @-@ war . In August 1800 Heywood was appointed commander of a bomb ship , the Vulcan , in which he visited Coupang where he had been held prisoner eight years earlier . At this time he began the hydrographic work that would mark the remainder of his naval career . 
 = = = Hydrographer = = = 
 In 1803 , after a succession of commands , Heywood was promoted to post @-@ captain . In command of HMS Leopard , Heywood conducted a series of surveys of the eastern coasts of Ceylon and India , areas that had not been studied previously , and produced what Alexander describes as " beautifully drafted charts " . In later years he was to produce similar charts for the north coast of Morocco , the River Plate area of South America , parts of the coasts of Sumatra and north @-@ west Australia , and other channels and coastlines . His skill in this area may well have developed from Bligh 's tutelage in the earlier stages of the Bounty voyage . Bligh , an accomplished draughtsman , had written of Christian and Heywood : " These two had been objects of my particular regard and attention , and I had taken great pains to instruct them . " James Horsburgh , who was hydrographer to the East India Company , wrote that Heywood 's work had " essentially contributed to making my Sailing Directory for the Indian navigation much more perfect than it would otherwise have been . " The extent of Heywood 's professional reputation was demonstrated when the position of Admiralty Hydrographer was offered to him in 1818 , after he had retired from the sea . He declined , and the appointment went to Francis Beaufort on Heywood 's recommendation . 
 = = = Later service = = = 
 After a brief period ashore in 1805 – 6 Heywood was appointed flag captain to Rear @-@ Admiral Sir George Murray , aboard HMS Polyphemus . In March 1802 Murray 's squadron was employed in the transportation of troops from the Cape of Good Hope to South America , in support of a failed British attempt to capture Buenos Aires from the Spanish , who were allied to the French during the Napoleonic wars . Polyphemus remained in the River Plate area , carrying out surveying and merchant vessel protection duties . 1808 saw Heywood back in England , in command of HMS Donegal , which in the following year was part of a squadron that attacked and destroyed three French frigates in the Bay of Biscay , an action for which he received the Admiralty 's thanks . After taking command of HMS Nereus in May 1809 , Heywood served briefly in the Mediterranean under Admiral Lord Collingwood ; after Collingwood 's death in March 1810 Heywood brought his commander 's body back to England . He then took Nereus to South America where he remained for three years , earning the gratitude of the British merchants in that region for his work in protecting trade routes . Heywood 's last command was HMS Montagu , in which he acted as escort to King Louis XVIII on the latter 's return to France in May 1814 . He remained with Montagu for the rest of his naval service . 
 Alexander suggests that throughout his later career Heywood suffered a sense of guilt over his pardon , knowing that he had " perjured himself " in saying that he was kept below and therefore prevented from joining Bligh . She believes that Pasley and Graham may have bribed William Cole to testify that Heywood had been held against his will , echoing Thomas Bond , Bligh 's nephew , who had asserted in 1792 that " Heywood 's friends have bribed through thick and thin to save him " . John Adams , the last survivor of Christian 's Bounty party that sailed to Pitcairn Island , was discovered in 1808 . In 1825 , interviewed by Captain Edward Belcher , Adams maintained that Heywood was on the gangway , not below , and " might have gone [ in the open boat ] if he pleased . " 
 = = = Retirement and death = = = 
 On 16 July 1816 Montagu was paid off in Chatham and Heywood finally retired from the sea . Two weeks later he married Frances Joliffe , a widow whom he had met ten years earlier , and settled with her at Highgate , near London . The couple had no children but , apart from his daughter in Tahiti , there is a suggestion in a will which he signed in 1810 that Heywood had also fathered a British child — the will makes provision for one Mary Gray , " an infant under my care and protection " . 
 In May 1818 Heywood declined command of the Canadian Lakes with the rank of commodore . As he had become content with shore life , he said he would only accept another appointment in the event of war . In retirement Heywood published his dictionary of the Tahitian language , wrote papers relating to his profession , and corresponded widely . He enjoyed a circle of acquaintances which included the writer Charles Lamb , and was a particular friend of the hydrographer Francis Beaufort . He destroyed much of his writing shortly before his death , but a document from 1829 survives , in which he expresses his views on the unfitness for self @-@ government of Greeks , Turks , Spaniards and Portuguese , the iniquities of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches , and the doubtful benefits of Catholic emancipation in Ireland . Of strong religious convictions , Heywood was increasingly interested in spiritual matters during the last years of his life . His health began to fail in 1828 , and he died after suffering a stroke , aged 58 , in February 1831 . He was interred in the vault of Highgate School chapel , where a memorial plaque was dedicated on 8 December 2008 . 
 Nessy Heywood had died on 25 August 1793 , less than a year after Heywood 's pardon . Heywood 's adversaries John Hallett and Thomas Hayward both died at sea within three years of the court martial . William Bligh served in the battles of Camperdown and Copenhagen before , in 1806 , he was appointed Governor of New South Wales . He returned to London in 1810 having suffered a further mutiny by corrupt local army officers who had taken exception to Bligh 's attempts to reform local practices that were highly lucrative for them , but detrimental to the colonial treasury . On his retirement he was promoted to rear admiral ; he died in 1817 . Fletcher Christian , who had taken the Bounty to Pitcairn Island and founded a colony there with a group of hard core mutineers and conscripted Tahitians , was killed in September 1793 during a feud . Christian 's last recorded words , supposedly , were " Oh , dear ! " 
 = Nuclear Strike ( Spooks ) = 
 " Nuclear Strike " is the series seven finale and 64th episode of the British espionage television series Spooks . It was originally broadcast on BBC One on 8 December 2008 . The episode was written by Neil Cross , and directed by Sam Miller . In the episode , Tiresias , the Russian equivalent of Sugarhorse , awakens a sleeper agent to detonate a nuclear suitcase bomb in central London . The Section D team use Connie James ( Gemma Jones ) , an FSB mole who helped set up Tiresias , to help them stop the bomb . However , the team find themselves targeted by an FSB kill squad , who are unaware of the bomb threat . 
 The idea behind the episode came from an earlier series three episode about a series of Russian weapons caches throughout the United Kingdom set up during the Cold War . Cross also felt it gratifying to kill off Connie , a character he created in the sixth series . Filming took place during the summer of 2008 , with much of it taking place in disused tunnels of the London Underground . The series seven finale was seen by six million viewers and a quarter of the television audience , a large increase of 900 @,@ 000 viewers and four share points from the previous week . Critics reacted to the episode with near universal acclaim , for being a " superb season closer , " " exciting " and " thrilling . " 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Faversham , Kent , Walter Crane ( Kevin Fuller ) receives the message " rain from heaven " in Russian from a numbers station . Upon hearing this , Crane <unk> a cache . Section D , having heard " Tiresias wakes 3 pm tomorrow " the previous episode , work on what the message means . Lucas North ( Richard Armitage ) and Harry Pearce ( Peter Firth ) discover Tiresias is the Russian equivalent of Sugarhorse , but " bigger and better ; " while Sugarhorse placed pro @-@ western Russians to infiltrate its government , Tiresias does the opposite ; recruit spies to infiltrate the British Government . Ros Myers ( Hermione Norris ) believes Connie James ( Gemma Jones ) , a mole from the FSB , might know what Tiresias is planning . Ros and Lucas release Connie from custody by posing as masked Russian agents . Later , it is revealed that FSB officers have been assigned to assassinate her . FSB head Viktor Sarkisiian ( Peter Sullivan ) orders a kill squad to search every MI5 safehouse , provided by Connie , to kill her and the Section D team who are harbouring her . 
 At the safe house " Ottawa Bravo " , Connie reveals she helped set up Tiresias over two decades ago and will give all sleeper agents and operations in exchange for safe passage to New Zealand . After listening to the numbers station broadcast , she reveals Tiresias has awakened a sleeper agent to a specific task ; detonating a nuclear suitcase bomb in central London by 3 pm . The only way to know where it would detonate is a locker at London Bridge station , which contain all Tiresias members and codes . When they start their journey however , they encounter the kill squad . They and Lucas engage in a shootout , and after evading them , the team decide to split up and regroup in Catherine Wheel Alley , while Harry returns to Thames House . 
 After returning , Harry warns Home Secretary Nicholas Blake ( Robert Glenister ) of the threat and tells him that if he receives a call from MI5 at 2 : 45 pm , he should order the evacuation of Parliament . Lucas , Ros and Connie regroup and head towards a London Underground station , but Lucas is wounded by a sniper ; though not seriously wounded , the kill squad could follow Lucas ' blood trail . To slow them down , Lucas sets up rudimentary traps and the three venture through empty tunnels towards the station . Later , the kill squad send in a runner to find the three ; Lucas is able to trip and kill him . Back in Thames House , Harry believes the FSB are not aware of the bomb threat , and decides to meet with Sarkisiian face @-@ to @-@ face . In order to get there alive , Harry uses the emergency " handshake protocols " and reasons with Sarkisiian that he would turn himself into the FSB if he stops the kill squad . Meanwhile , Lucas attempts to draw off the squad by splitting up , but at the confrontation , his gun jams and is cornered . Before he can be killed , Sarkisiian calls the team off and orders them to help stop the bomb . 
 Ros and Connie find the locker with the bomber 's name and location , Grosvenor Square . An FSB sniper kills Crane , and at Connie 's request , the bomb is sent to her , as she is the only person with the expertise to disarm it . Connie defuses the bomb , but by doing so a secondary countdown is initiated . She removes the nuclear material , but the bomb will still detonate . In her last words , Connie admits that she set up Lucas in Moscow eight years ago , which resulted in his imprisonment . Lucas and Ros then run to safety as the bomb detonates , killing Connie . With disaster averted , Lucas calls Harry , but receives no answer . In the end , it is revealed Sarkisiian has him locked up in the boot of his car . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 The episode was written by Neil Cross . Before he started writing Cross did not know Connie was the mole from the previous episode , so he included it to help with the storyline . The character was originally intended to be killed by the end of the last episode , but Cross kept her alive until the end of the finale . He wanted her killed off at this episode , as he was the one who created Connie in the sixth series , and felt it gratifying to kill off a character he created . In writing the plot , Cross was inspired by the Rupert Walters script for " Frequently Asked Questions " from the third series , which revealed a series of weapons caches throughout the United Kingdom set up by the Russians during the Cold War ; Cross wanted to use that as a way to introduce the nuclear suitcase bomb . The bombs design from the episode was based from actual designs , but invented its <unk> . 
 The producers also intended to tease the audience that after the brutal killing of Ben Kaplan ( Alex Lanipekun ) from the previous episode , they would think that things could not get worse for the team , until the nuclear threat in the finale . The scene where the team breaks Connie out was intended to show the audience that the protagonists are willing to go to extreme measures to stop serious threats . Cross wanted to make it a very pure Spooks episode by setting up the entire plot in one scene , and then include a chase throughout London between FSB officers and the main characters . Cross enjoyed creating the FSB team featured in the episode , especially as he created them as a Russian version of the Spooks protagonists , but also make their base much more lit with windows . The bomb <unk> scene was originally set at a graveyard , but the producers decided it would be best to set it underground . Though it took several rewrites , the script remained " fundamentally the same " throughout the writing process . 
 The part where Connie asks for safe passage to New Zealand was a " sly personal reference " to Cross , as the writer himself resides in the country . In one scene , Lucas can be seen breaking into a car and getting his hands on various items that would be useful to help set up traps against the FSB officers . Throughout the episode 's development , the items kept changing . There were also staff discussions about what they could get away with in terms of the protagonists killing FSB officers . The most prominent discussions included Harry strangling one officer with his necktie , and Lucas shooting another in the head in cold blood despite being unarmed and subdued . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Kevin Fuller was cast as Walter Crane , the man with the bomb . The character did not say a word throughout the entirety of the episode , yet had such a strong presence , which the producers felt was unique for a guest star in the series . Fuller did " a lot of getting into the part , " director Sam Miller felt that Fuller was one of the most influential actors he ever worked with . Elsewhere , Peter Sullivan , who plays Sarkisiian , never spoke Russian before . Since most of his dialogue would be in Russian , Sullivan was trained how to speak it phonetically before he would play the part . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The episode was filmed sometime during Summer 2008 . Miller wanted to style the filming as if the cameras are following the team like in a documentary . The first day was spent in the " Ottawa Bravo " safe house set , where Connie reveals the threat . Throughout the shoot , Gemma Jones had hip problems . Concerned , the producers set up a body double on hand . However , Jones insisted she could do everything herself , and in the end the double was not used . During the first shootout scene in the episode , Miller wanted to make the sequence as real as possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack . Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence ; " There was a shoot @-@ out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly . It 's a weird thing . I 'm not a violent person but when you put a gun in somebody 's hands something strange happens . It 's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again . " 
 Filming did face some disruptions . The sequence where Lucas breaks into a car for some supplies was filmed at a street near Hyde Park . On one end of the street was an event in the park , while on the other end a wedding took place . Elsewhere , Fuller carried a mock @-@ suitcase bomb to film in Grosvenor Square . However , because the American Embassy is situated next to the square , shortly after Fuller and the filming crew arrived , they found themselves surrounded by five armed American security officers who believed Fuller was about to commit an attack . Fortunately , location manager Patrick Stuart was able to " sweet @-@ talk " the American officials , and they were allowed to film in the area . 
 Five days of filming were spent at the London Underground tunnels . Filming took place on actual tube tunnels , albeit disused ones . As the crew were scouting the disused Aldwych tunnels , they found the ex @-@ Northern line 1972 stock train stabled in the tunnel for maintenance , training , and filming purposes . When Sam Miller called Cross about the development , the writer included it as a last minute addition to the script , and the sequence was shot the next day . As a way to scare the audience , Cross included a homeless woman living in the train . The filming crew present disliked filming the Underground sequences because while filmed during the summer , it became hot locations to work in . The crew were prohibited from bringing food or drink into the tunnels , as it would attract rats . Furthermore , break times had to be longer than usual because it would take a while for a crew member to leave the tunnels , have a break and then return . The FSB base was filmed in the London Docklands , near the ExCeL London . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Though the series in general does not note many cultural references , Neil Cross decided to include some into this particular episode . The phrases " rain from heaven " and " it is twice blest " from the numbers station was taken from " The Quality of Mercy " speech from the William Shakespeare play The Merchant of Venice . The speech begins ; " The quality of mercy is not strain 'd , it <unk> as the gentle rain from heaven . Upon the place beneath : it is twice blest ; it <unk> him that gives and him that takes ... " Later in the episode , Lucas tells Connie about Bridget Driscoll , the first person in the United Kingdom to be run over and killed by a car , which , while big news back in her time , becomes forgotten over time and is now only " a single moment , " much like Connie 's contributions to her country during the Cold War . When Jo asks Malcolm to evacuate his mother , he explains she is busy watching A Place in the Sun , a television programme about Britons buying property abroad , followed by Countdown , a game show on Channel 4 . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 The episode was originally broadcast on BBC One , during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot on Monday , 8 December 2008 . However , it was held back to 10 : 40 pm in Northern Ireland , and did not broadcast in Scotland on the day all together . The finale attracted 6 million viewers on its original broadcast , earning a 25 % audience share . Ratings were up by 900 @,@ 000 viewers and four share points from the previous episode which aired against I 'm a Celebrity , Get , Me Out of Here ! on ITV1 . On the next week , the Spooks finale beat Taggart on ITV1 in the same time slot . " Nuclear Strike " ended being the ninth most seen broadcast on BBC One , and the 24th most seen broadcast overall the week it aired . 
 The episode attracted near universal acclaim . The Spooks producers regard " Nuclear Strike " as one of their favourites in the series . Sam Wollaston of The Guardian reacted positively to the episode , stating " it 's nice to see MI5 locking horns with the Russians again . Maybe the Spooks people just got bored with Islamic terrorism , so they did what they had to do : they restarted the cold war . A bold move , but an admirable one . " Gerard O 'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph placed the episode as a " critic 's choice , " calling it a " superb season closer , " and " all terrifically exciting . " O 'Donovan also said of the episode 's settings ; " the streets and Underground tunnels of London have rarely been used to such climactic effect – with great performances from everyone involved . " He also complimented it for setting up a " great cliffhanger ending that will leave fans absolutely gagging for the next series . " 
 Andrew Billen of The Times however , felt the finale was " not [ a ] very exciting episode , " and " conducted with a minimum of acting . " Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop praised the episode , saying " Neil Cross knows a thing or two about ratcheting up the tension , and in the finale of the seventh series of Spooks he used both of them . And then , from somewhere , he found a third thing . And a fourth , " and " pressure piled on pressure relentlessly throughout this brilliant finale as each new success only led to the next , even bigger problem . " Gimmers called the chase sequence in the episode " one of the most thrilling traditional chase sequences ever seen on British TV , " the interplay between the characters " was handled expertly , " and ended with " already I can 't wait for the next series !

 = Lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture = 
 The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture ( Cathartes burrovianus ) also known as the savannah vulture , is a species of bird in the New World vulture family Cathartidae . It was considered to be the same species as the greater yellow @-@ headed vulture until they were split in 1964 . It is found in Mexico , Central America , and South America in seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland , swamps , and heavily degraded former forest . It is a large bird , with a wingspan of 150 – 165 centimetres ( 59 – 65 in ) . The body plumage is black , and the head and neck , which are featherless , are pale orange with red or blue areas . It lacks a syrinx , so therefore its vocalizations are limited to grunts or low hisses . 
 The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture feeds on carrion and locates carcasses by sight and by smell , an ability which is rare in birds . It is dependent on larger vultures , such as the king vulture , to open the hides of larger animal carcasses as its bill is not strong enough to do this . Like other New World vultures , the lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort . It lays its eggs on flat surfaces , such as the floors of caves , or in the hollows of stumps . It feeds its young by regurgitation . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture was first described in 1845 by John Cassin . It is sometimes recognized as having two subspecies . The first , Cathartes burrovianus <unk> , described by Austrian ornithologist August von <unk> in 1851 , is the larger of the two and is found from Argentina north to Colombia , while the nominate subspecies , Cathartes burrovianus burrovianus , is smaller and found from northwestern South America through Central America to Mexico . The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture 's genus , Cathartes , means " purifier " and is from the Latinized form of the Greek kathartēs / καθαρτης . The common name , vulture , is derived from the Latin word vulturus , which means " tearer " and is a reference to its feeding habits . 
 The exact taxonomic placement of the lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear . Although both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles , the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world . Just how different the two are is currently under debate , with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks . More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order , Cathartiformes . The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis , but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible . Like other New World vultures , the lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture is 53 – 66 cm ( 21 – 26 in ) in length , with a wingspan of 150 – 165 cm ( 59 – 65 in ) and a tail length of 19 – 24 cm ( 7 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 4 in ) . Its weight ranges from 0 @.@ 95 to 1 @.@ 55 kg ( 2 @.@ 1 to 3 @.@ 4 lb ) . Its plumage is black with a green sheen . The throat and the sides of the head are featherless . The head and neck are bare of feathers , and the skin is yellow , with a reddish forehead and nape and a gray @-@ blue crown . The irises of its eyes are red , its legs are white , and its beak is flesh @-@ colored . The eye has a single incomplete row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid . The tail is rounded and relatively short for a vulture ; the tip of the closed wing extends beyond the tail . Immature lesser yellow @-@ headed vultures have browner plumage , a dusky head , and a white nape . 
 The beak is thick , rounded , and hooked at the tip . The front toes are long with small webs at their bases and are not adapted to grasping . The opening of the nostril is longitudinal , and the nostrils lack a septum . Like all New World vultures , the lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture lacks a syrinx , and is therefore unable to make any sound other than a low hiss . 
 It differs in appearance from the similar greater yellow @-@ headed vulture in several ways . It is smaller and is less heavily built than the greater yellow @-@ headed vulture and has a shorter , thinner tail . The plumage is browner than the greater yellow @-@ headed vulture 's dark , glossy black plumage . Its legs are lighter in color , and its head is more orange @-@ tinged than the more yellow head of the greater yellow @-@ headed vulture . Its flight is also less steady than that of the greater yellow @-@ headed vulture . The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture also prefers to live in savannas , as opposed to the preferred forest habitat of the greater yellow @-@ headed vulture . 
 Besides the greater yellow @-@ headed vulture , it is similar to the turkey vulture . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 It is found in Argentina , Belize , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Costa Rica , Ecuador , El Salvador , French Guiana , Guatemala , Guyana , Honduras , Mexico , Nicaragua , Panama , Paraguay , Peru , Suriname , Uruguay , and Venezuela . Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland , swamps , mangroves , and heavily degraded former forest . It may wander over dry fields and clearings . It is not generally found in high @-@ altitude regions . 
 This bird with its somehow crow @-@ like aspect gave foot to the naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos ( Crows Ravine ) in Uruguay , where they dwell together with the black vulture and the turkey vulture . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture flies solitarily , with wings held in a dihedral position . It glides at a low altitude over wetlands while locating food , and perches on fence posts or on other low perches . When flying , it travels alone and is rarely found in groups . The flight of the lesser yellow @-@ headed is an example of static soaring flight , which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings . This vulture rarely soars high in the air , preferring low altitudes . This bird is believed to be somewhat migratory in response to the changes in water level where it lives . The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture , like other New World vultures , has the unusual habit of urohidrosis , in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them by evaporation . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture is a scavenger and subsists almost entirely on carrion . It will eat roadkill or the carcass of any animal , but is also known to hunt for food , especially small aquatic animals in marshes . It prefers fresh meat , but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal because its beak is not strong enough to tear into the tough hide . The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion once the meat is in a state of extreme decay , as it becomes contaminated with microbial toxins . Like other vultures , it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease . 
 The lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture forages using its keen eyesight to locate carrion on the ground , but also uses its sense of smell , an ability which is uncommon in the avian world . It locates carrion by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan , a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals . The olfactory lobe of its brain responsible for processing smells is particularly large compared to other animals . This characteristic of New World vultures has been used by humans : ethyl mercaptan is injected into pipelines , and engineers looking for leaks then follow the foraging vultures . 
 King vultures , which lack the ability to smell carrion , follow the lesser yellow @-@ headed vultures to carcasses , where the king vulture tears open the skin of the dead animal . This allows the smaller lesser yellow @-@ headed vulture access to food , as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals . This is an example of mutual dependence between species . It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures , due to their larger size . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Lesser yellow @-@ headed vultures do not build nests , but rather lay eggs on the ground , cliff ledges , the floors of caves , or in the hollow of a tree . Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots , particularly around the larger end . Two eggs are generally laid . The chicks are altricial — they are blind , naked and relatively immobile upon hatching . The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later . The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre @-@ digested food into their beak , where the chicks then drink it . Young fledge after two to three months . 
 = = Conservation = =

 State Route 47 ( SR 47 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California , connecting Terminal Island to the mainland in the Los Angeles area . From its south end at I @-@ 110 in San Pedro , it heads east across the Vincent Thomas Bridge to the island and the end of state maintenance . The state highway begins again at the junction with I @-@ 710 on Terminal Island , crossing the Schuyler Heim Bridge north to the mainland and the second terminus , where SR 103 begins . Signage continues along a locally maintained route , mainly Alameda Street , to the Gardena Freeway ( SR 91 ) in Compton , and an unconstructed alignment follows the same corridor to the Santa Monica Freeway ( I @-@ 10 ) near downtown Los Angeles . 
 The entire route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System , and both constructed segments are freeways , officially known as parts of the Seaside Freeway ( which continues to SR 1 via I @-@ 710 ) and Terminal Island Freeway ( which continues to SR 1 via SR 103 ) . However , there are several at @-@ grade intersections along the gap on Terminal Island , and Alameda Street is a surface roadway , albeit one with few intersections , as it runs alongside the Alameda Corridor rail line . 
 = = Route description = = 
 State Route 47 begins at the south end of the Harbor Freeway ( I @-@ 110 ) in the Los Angeles neighborhood of San Pedro and heads east to the Vincent Thomas Bridge , with only one interchange - at Harbor Boulevard - before the 1963 suspension bridge over the main channel of Los Angeles Harbor . After coming back to ground level on Terminal Island , SR 47 becomes the locally @-@ maintained Seaside Avenue at the interchange with Ferry Street , where there was a toll plaza until 2000 . The freeway ends just beyond at Navy Way , after which the road enters Long Beach and becomes Ocean Boulevard , which was rebuilt as a freeway in 2007 . However , SR 47 must exit the freeway onto its frontage roads , intersecting Henry Ford Avenue before turning north onto the Terminal Island Freeway . Ocean Boulevard leads east over the Gerald Desmond Bridge and becomes Interstate 710 , with access to downtown Long Beach . 
 State maintenance begins again on the Terminal Island Freeway , which is also signed as State Route 103 . After a partial interchange with New Dock Street , only allowing access to and from the north , SR 47 crosses the Cerritos Channel on the Schuyler Heim Bridge , a lift bridge opened in 1948 . Just beyond the bridge , SR 47 leaves the freeway , which continues northeast as SR 103 , onto Henry Ford Avenue , and state maintenance ends . The remainder of what is signed as SR 47 , along Henry Ford Avenue and Alameda Street to the Redondo Beach Freeway ( SR 91 ) , is locally maintained . Henry Ford Avenue quickly crosses the Dominguez Channel and Anaheim Street , and merges with Alameda Street , which continues southwest into Wilmington as a local street . 
 = = = Alameda Street = = = 
 The part of Alameda Street rebuilt during the Alameda Corridor project begins here , and the roadway passes under all cross streets - Pacific Coast Highway ( SR 1 ) , Sepulveda Boulevard , 223rd Street ( at the San Diego Freeway / I @-@ 405 interchange ) , Carson Street , Del Amo Boulevard , and Artesia Boulevard ( at the Redondo Beach Freeway / SR 91 interchange ) - with two @-@ way connector ramps . The one major at @-@ grade intersection here is the split with Santa Fe Avenue north of Del Amo Boulevard , just south of the underpass where Alameda Street moves from the east to the west side of the rail line . ( Before the corridor was built , the crossover was further south , at Dominguez Street , halfway between Carson Street and Del Amo Boulevard . ) 
 North of Artesia Boulevard , the rail line descends into the 10 @-@ mile ( 16 km ) Mid @-@ Corridor Trench , with two streets straddling it at ground level : Alameda Street to the west and a local frontage road to the east . All cross streets are thus grade @-@ separated from the rail line while intersecting the streets at grade , except for Rosecrans Avenue , which bridges over all three . Crossings along this segment include the Century Freeway ( I @-@ 105 , no access ) , Imperial Highway , Firestone Boulevard ( former SR 42 ) , and Slauson Avenue . Just south of 25th Street , the rail line curves northeast out of the trench , and the two roadways join to become a single Alameda Street , which soon interchanges with the Santa Monica Freeway ( I @-@ 10 ) , at the north end of what is legislated as Route 47 . The street continues north through the east side of downtown Los Angeles , crossing the Santa Ana Freeway ( US 101 ) just west of Union Station , and ending soon after at Elmyra Street , where it becomes Spring Street . 
 = = History = = 
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors decided in mid @-@ 1916 , at the urging of the Harbor Truck Highway Association ( formed mid @-@ 1914 ) , to build a Harbor Truck Boulevard stretching about 10 miles ( 15 km ) between Los Angeles and Compton , intended to be used by trucks to the Port of Los Angeles at San Pedro . After that portion was completed , an extension to Wilmington was opened on February 2 , 1924 , resulting in a completely independent truck route to the port . This roadway , which lay about halfway between Wilmington Avenue and Long Beach Boulevard , extended the existing Alameda Street , which ran along — to Slauson Avenue — and then west of the Southern Pacific Railroad 's San Pedro Branch to Oris Street , the north limit of Compton . The truck boulevard continued along the west side to Dominguez Street ( lying between the SP 's San Pedro Branch and Pacific Electric Railway 's Dominguez Line beyond Dominguez Junction ) , and crossed there to the east side for the rest of the route to Anaheim Street in Wilmington . There trucks could turn east and south to Terminal Island via Henry Ford Avenue , or continue southwest through Wilmington to San Pedro . The highway soon came to be known as Alameda Street all the way to Wilmington . It did not become a state highway ; instead the state took over Figueroa Street ( SR 11 ) to the west and Atlantic Avenue ( SR 15 ) to the east . 
 Plans for freeways in Los Angeles County evolved from a 1937 Automobile Club of Southern California plan , which was modified by the city 's Transportation Engineering Board ( <unk> ) in 1939 . The former included a single freeway connecting Los Angeles to Long Beach , beginning at Pasadena and heading south @-@ southwest to Lynwood , then paralleling Long Beach Boulevard to Long Beach . The <unk> 's plan shifted this route farther east to near the present Long Beach Freeway , while keeping the route near Long Beach Boulevard as a second freeway leaving the Ramona Parkway ( San Bernardino Freeway ) east of downtown and heading south near Alameda Street and Long Beach Boulevard to Long Beach . This second freeway came to be known as the Long Beach Parkway or Alamitos Parkway , and connected in north Long Beach with a Terminal Island Freeway southwest to Terminal Island . Because the Long Beach Naval Shipyard was located on the island , the U.S. Navy paid for the construction of the $ 14 million freeway from the island to Willow Street , including the $ 5 @.@ 3 million Schuyler Heim Lift Bridge . Construction began in early 1946 , and the completed link was dedicated on January 10 , 1948 , replacing the older Henry Ford Bridge . 
 Early plans also included a north – south freeway on each side of the Los Angeles Central Business District , splitting at the merge of the Harbor Parkway ( Harbor Freeway ) and Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California , and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway ( Pasadena Freeway ) and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium . Initially known as the East By @-@ Pass and West By @-@ Pass , the latter later became part of the Harbor Parkway , while the former remained as a separate route roughly along Main Street . The state legislature added the East By @-@ Pass to the state highway system in 1947 as Route 222 . The Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved a revised master plan in mid @-@ 1955 , based on various studied that had been made . A new Industrial Freeway replaced the Terminal Island Freeway and Alamitos Parkway between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles , where it then continued north along the former East By @-@ Pass ( which was not kept south of the Santa Monica Freeway ) and the southern part of the Riverside Parkway to the interchange of the Glendale Freeway and Golden State Freeway ( which had replaced the rest of the Riverside Parkway ) . The Industrial Freeway south of the Santa Monica Freeway became Route 270 in 1959 , but the ex @-@ Riverside Parkway piece north of the Arroyo Seco Parkway never became a state highway . 
 In the 1964 renumbering , the Industrial Freeway became Route 47 , and the former East By @-@ Pass became Route 241 . The latter was deleted the next year , and the former was extended west from its south end on Terminal Island to San Pedro , replacing part of SR 7 , which was truncated to SR 1 in Long Beach at the same time . ( I @-@ 710 , which later replaced SR 7 , has since been re @-@ extended to SR 47 on Terminal Island . ) This extension , which had been added to the state highway system in 1949 as part of Route 231 , included the 1963 Vincent Thomas Bridge . Construction on the $ 5 @.@ 8 million freeway link from that bridge west to the Harbor Freeway in San Pedro — officially the Seaside Freeway , but called an extension of the Harbor Freeway by the media — began in March 1968 , and it was dedicated on July 9 , 1970 . The two parts of SR 47 were , and still are , connected by the Los Angeles @-@ maintained Seaside Avenue and Long Beach @-@ maintained Ocean Boulevard . ( A freeway upgrade of the latter was completed in June 2007 , but traffic signals remain on the former and on the ramps connecting Ocean Boulevard with the Terminal Island Freeway . ) 
 Early maps show that the Terminal Island Freeway was to extend north to the Long Beach Freeway ( I @-@ 710 ) near the San Diego Freeway ( I @-@ 405 ) , but the location for SR 47 adopted by the California Highway Commission on January 22 , 1969 led northwest from the Terminal Island Freeway 's end at Carson Street to I @-@ 405 near Alameda Street , and then paralleled that street into Los Angeles . A 1982 state law specified that SR 47 shall use Henry Ford Avenue and Alameda Street between the Heim Bridge and the Redondo Beach Freeway ( SR 91 ) , rather than the adopted alignment to the east , and in 1984 the legislature created State Route 103 to replace the former alignment on the Terminal Island Freeway between SR 47 and the Pacific Coast Highway ( SR 1 ) . Due to the cancellation of the Industrial Freeway and planned port expansions , the Alameda Corridor project was created , including an improved rail line and a widening of Alameda Street from four to six lanes south of SR 91 . Alameda Street was rebuilt for the project , with grade separations at most major streets south of SR 91 , and is now signed as part of SR 47 there , but remains mostly four lanes . As part of a project to replace the Heim Bridge , Caltrans and the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority plan to improve the connection near the south end of Alameda Street , possibly by building a new expressway replacement for SR 47 south of SR 1 , or by extending SR 103 northwest via the originally @-@ planned alignment to Alameda Street south of I @-@ 405 .

Wesker injects her with Anti @-@ Virus before the autopilot crashes the plane . Only Alice survives . 
 Months later , Alice travels to Alaska in an airplane , tracking broadcasts from a safe haven called Arcadia ; however , she only finds abandoned planes , and is attacked by feral Claire Redfield ( Ali Larter ) . Alice destroys a spider @-@ like device on Claire 's chest , giving her amnesia and pacifying her . They travel to the ruins of L.A. , where they find survivors living in a prison surrounded by infected . They meet Luther West ( Boris Kodjoe ) , Wendell ( Fulvio <unk> ) , Crystal Waters ( Kacey Barnfield ) , Bennett ( Kim Coates ) , Kim Yong ( Norman Yeung ) , and Angel Ortiz ( Sergio <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . With their help , Alice lands on the prison 's roof and learns Arcadia isn 't a fixed place , but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast . However , though the ship hasn 't moved , no @-@ one from it has responded to the group 's rescue flares . Luther takes Alice to the last inmate , Chris ( Wentworth Miller ) , who insists he 's falsely imprisoned , and will reveal an escape route for freedom . Alice goes to the showers to wash up , but catches Wendell attempting to peep . They are attacked by a group of infected that dug into the prison , and take Wendell ; she manages to kill them . 
 Desperate , they free Chris , who reveals Claire 's his sister , and the prison has an armored car they can use to escape . However , a giant axe @-@ wielding monster begins breaking down the gate . Alice , Chris and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns ; however , zombies kill Crystal en route . Luther and Claire reinforce the gate . Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine and it would take a week to fix . Bennett shoots Angel and heads for Arcadia in Alice 's airplane . The Axeman breaks down the gate , allowing the zombies into the prison . The group decides to use the zombie @-@ dug tunnels to escape into the sewers . Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman , whom Alice and Claire kill . Unfortunately , Luther is dragged back into the tunnels by a zombie , 
 Alice and the Redfields board the Arcadia , discovering it functional but abandoned . Claire then remembers Arcadia is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects ; they release the survivors , among them K @-@ Mart ( Spencer Locke ) . Alice follows a trail of blood deeper into the ship , where she finds Wesker . The T @-@ virus revived him , but it battles Wesker for control , something he believes fresh human DNA can pacify ; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects . Alice 's DNA is superior to his , since she retained control despite bonding with the virus at a cellular level ; he believes eating her will give him back control . 
 The Redfields fight Wesker while Alice battles Bennett , now working for Wesker . Wesker easily overpowers Chris and Claire , but Alice is able to defeat both Bennett and Wesker with help from K @-@ Mart . They lock Bennett in the room with Wesker 's corpse . Bennett is devoured by Wesker when he revives . Wesker then escapes in an aircraft , activating a bomb on the Arcadia ; the plane explodes instead as Alice placed the bomb there beforehand . Unbeknownst to them , Wesker parachutes away from the explosion , while Luther emerges from the sewers , battered but alive . Alice resolves to turn Arcadia into a real haven and broadcasts a new message for any other survivors . As Alice , Claire and Chris watch over from Arcadia , it is approached by a military squadron of Umbrella aircraft .

 In May 2005 , producers mentioned the possibility of following Extinction with a sequel entitled Afterlife , to be shot and set in Tokyo , Japan and Alaska . Despite Resident Evil : Extinction being billed on the official website and elsewhere as the final installment of the Resident Evil film series ; on September 23 , 2007 , Rory Bruer , Sony 's head of distribution explained , " It absolutely would not surprise me considering the success of the franchise that they find a way to come up with another . It 's a real possibility . " Producer Jeremy Bolt also stated that while there was no intention of making a fourth film , that the third had been particularly well done and that Paul Anderson was talking with Sony about the possibility . In June 2008 , Anderson noted that negotiations were underway with Sony for creating the film . In December 2008 , Anderson stated that he was working on the script . The following year , it was announced that Sony was aiming to release Resident Evil : Afterlife by August 27 , 2010 . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 In September 2006 , reports indicated that casting for the fourth film had begun , with Jensen Ackles being considered for the role of Leon S. Kennedy . Ali Larter missed seven episodes of filming the television show Heroes in order to appear in the film . Before Wentworth Miller was cast as Chris Redfield , actor Johnny Messner auditioned for the role . Having never played the Resident Evil video games , Miller began preparing for the role by searching the internet for images of Chris Redfield . Much to his surprise , he noticed how muscular the character was ; with only three weeks to prep before shooting , he knew it was impossible to increase his muscle mass to that extent . He was shown video footage of the games and saw how he was visually different , especially in the first game . He did cardio to build up endurance . Miller described his interpretation on the character from the video game as , " He 's definitely capable and heroic , but there 's also something quite innocent . He was still freshly scrubbed , in a way , at the beginning of this horrifying journey . " He described his take as the character in the film , " My Chris has been walking down this particular road for quite some time . The edges are sharper , and they ’ re way more jagged . " 
 Shawn Roberts was originally going to audition for Chris Redfield before Miller accepted the role . He went to audition for the role of Albert Wesker , a role previously played by Jason O 'Mara . Describing the character Roberts said , " [ He 's the ] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation . He is in a position of power . He pretty much runs the world , and Alice is an annoyance . It 's a whole process : I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big , long black jacket , and props comes over and gives me the dark glasses and the gloves . By the time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter , you walk a little differently . He 's got everything going for him — he 's super fast , super strong , has the ability to regenerate — it 's all the elements from the game . That was one thing we all agreed on from the start : this character has to be for the fans . " Sienna Guillory reprises her role as Jill Valentine , who was last seen in Resident Evil : Apocalypse . She is featured briefly in a scene shown during the credits , setting up the sequel . 
 = = = Cinematography and set design = = = 
 Anderson was shown footage of James Cameron 's Avatar which sold him on the idea to shoot Resident Evil : Afterlife in digital 3D . He shot in high @-@ definition with an aspect ratio of 2 @.@ 35 : 1 using Cameron 's Fusion Camera System , or more specifically a Sony F35 camera . The crew spent two weeks in pre @-@ production learning the 3D camera system . With a budget of about $ 60 million , principal photography took place for 55 days from September 29 , 2009 to December . Filming in 3D added 20 % to the budget . Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10 , 2009 . The final showdown scene was filmed for about six days . During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $ 100 @,@ 000 camera . 
 For slow motion scenes like with bullets and drops of water , twin Phantom high @-@ speed cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second . A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot @-@ by @-@ shot for the film and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker 's superhuman speed which took about two days to film . The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers were not able to use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs . Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot . Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen . A 1983 Yak @-@ 52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter . Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera . 
 The 3D cameras were unable to pick up anything shiny , such as stainless steel , due to a flare . Set decorator Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality . The saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom the 3D cameras , which are " slow to pick up information " . Loucks said , " It 's a very restrictive color palette . For example , in this warehouse scene , we saturated the floors in a dark , dark charcoal , and we thought that was enough , but then the cameras showed them as still being too light . So we had to add more and more black . The reason I say it 's too light is because we are putting more light onto these sets than we ever have before . "

 Principal photography was done mostly at Cinespace Film Studios in Toronto , Ontario . Toronto police received hundreds of calls from concerned neighbors after a scene involving a burning plane crashed . For the underwater scenes , cargo shipping containers were cut and welded to make a giant tank on stage . The opening scene was filmed at the Shibuya Crossing in Shibuya , Tokyo . Interior scenes of Umbrella Corporation 's subterranean lair were filmed at the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy . Robarts Library was used to portray exterior shots of a Los Angeles prison due to its resemblance to a prison , and other scenes were shot at University of Toronto Scarborough . Scenes portraying an Alaskan aircraft boneyard were actually filmed at Oshawa Airport . A location depicting an Alaskan beach was filmed at Sandbanks Provincial Park . Second unit was sent to Alaska to capture establishing shots of the scenery .

 Visual effects were done by Rocket Science VFX and Mr. X Inc . Paul Jones served as the special effects creator , who previously designed the Nemesis character in Resident Evil : Apocalypse . The production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once , but time restraints prevented that . Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc 's visual effects supervisor , Dennis Berardi , added more in post @-@ production . For Alice 's clones they shot motion control photography for multiple passes of Jovovich . For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles . Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described the look of the film , " interesting contrasts , pure whites , which is a staggering look . It 's so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of Silent Hill . So we 've got the extremes , but it 's definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it 's been fun to see those looks . " A burned cityscape with ash and smoke in the sky was created to depict a postapocalyptic Los Angeles , in which most of the film is set . Bolt described this approach as , " In a world that has gone to hell in a <unk> , there 's no control and no fire service , so clearly , what 's going to happen to LA is it 's going to get burned . " 
 The infected Dobermans from the games and previous films return , but are more advanced . The dogs wore a costume with prosthetics . Anderson wanted to make the dogs in this film look " absolutely terrible " . Computer effects were used to make the dog 's jaw flare open , with tentacles coming out of their mouths similar to the dogs from the fourth and fifth video games . Other creatures borrowed from the fifth video game are the " Majini " who are more intelligent and have mandibles and tentacles coming out of their mouths , and " The Executioner " ( named the Axeman in the film ) .

As part of the storyline , Benjamin then feuded with the other members of Triple H 's stable Evolution . Benjamin defeated Ric Flair at Backlash and lost to Randy Orton in an Intercontinental Championship match at Bad Blood . 
 During a match with Garrison Cade on Heat , Benjamin punched Cade 's knee brace , legitimately breaking his hand in the process and briefly taking him out of action .

As a part of the scripted ending to the match , Michaels was preparing to finish the match when Benjamin tagged himself in and missed a crossbody , allowing Carlito to pin Benjamin . Benjamin was then depicted as having a " losing streak " over the next several weeks , which led to Benjamin 's noisy , scolding , and domineering " Momma " ( played by comedian / actress Thea <unk> ) coming to Raw to confront Benjamin . Momma slapped and yelled at Benjamin every time he lost a match . Before long , she assisted Benjamin in his matches , often interfering on his behalf .

At one point , Benjamin was defeated by his former tag team partner , the returning Charlie Haas , during an episode of Raw . A predetermined stipulation added to this loss meant that Benjamin had to defend the Intercontinental Title in the same match as his shot at Van Dam 's contract , meaning at Backlash it would be a " Winner Takes All " match . Rob Van Dam won at Backlash and became Intercontinental Champion . Benjamin regained the title from Rob Van Dam in a Tornado Tag Team match , pitting Benjamin , Triple H and Chris Masters against Van Dam and WWE Champion John Cena ; both the WWE Championship and WWE Intercontinental Championship could be won by whoever pinned the appropriate champion . After Triple H Pedigreed Van Dam , he turned his attention to John Cena and went for the pin on the WWE Champion . Benjamin got to Van Dam first , picking up the pin and his third Intercontinental Championship . Subsequently , Benjamin feuded with Carlito and others for his Intercontinental Championship before losing the title to Johnny Nitro in a Triple Threat match also involving Carlito at Vengeance .

 Originally a Danish prince , George was born in Copenhagen , and seemed destined for a career in the Royal Danish Navy . He was only 17 years old when he was elected king by the Greek National Assembly , which had deposed the unpopular former king Otto . His nomination was both suggested and supported by the Great Powers : the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , the Second French Empire and the Russian Empire . He married the Russian grand duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia , and became the first monarch of a new Greek dynasty . Two of his sisters , Alexandra and Dagmar , married into the British and Russian royal families . King Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III were his brothers @-@ in @-@ law and King George V and Tsar Nicholas II were his nephews . 
 George 's reign of almost 50 years ( the longest in modern Greek history ) was characterized by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre @-@ World War I Europe . Britain ceded the Ionian Islands peacefully , while Thessaly was annexed from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo @-@ Turkish War ( 1877 – 1878 ) . Greece was not always successful in its expansionist ambitions ; it was defeated in the Greco @-@ Turkish War ( 1897 ) . During the First Balkan War , after Greek troops had occupied much of Greek Macedonia , George was assassinated in Thessaloniki . Compared to his own long tenure , the reigns of his successors Constantine , Alexander , and George proved short and insecure . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 George was born at the Yellow Palace , an 18th @-@ century town house at 18 <unk> , right next to the Amalienborg Palace complex in Copenhagen . He was the second son of Prince Christian of Schleswig @-@ Holstein @-@ Sonderburg @-@ Glücksburg and Louise of Hesse @-@ Kassel . Although his full name was Prince Christian Vilhelm Ferdinand Adolf Georg of Schleswig @-@ Holstein @-@ Sonderburg @-@ Glücksburg , until his accession in Greece , he was known as Prince Vilhelm ( William ) , the namesake of his paternal and maternal grandfathers , William , Duke of Schleswig @-@ Holstein @-@ Sonderburg @-@ Glücksburg , and Prince William of Hesse @-@ Kassel . 
 Although he was of royal blood , his family was relatively obscure and lived a comparatively normal life by royal standards . In 1852 , however , George 's father was designated the heir presumptive to the childless King Frederick VII of Denmark , and the family became princes and princesses of Denmark . George 's siblings were Frederick ( who succeeded their father as King of Denmark ) , Alexandra ( who became queen consort of Edward VII of the United Kingdom and the mother of King George V ) , Dagmar ( who , as Empress Maria Feodorovna , was consort of Alexander III of Russia and the mother of Tsar Nicholas II ) , Thyra ( who married Prince Ernest Augustus , 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale ) and Valdemar . 
 George 's mother tongue was Danish , with English as a second language . He was also taught French and German . He embarked on a career in the Royal Danish Navy , and enrolled as a naval cadet along with his elder brother Frederick . While Frederick was described as " quiet and extremely well @-@ behaved " , George was " lively and full of pranks " .

 Following the overthrow of the Bavarian @-@ born King Otto of Greece in October 1862 , the Greek people had rejected Otto 's brother and designated successor Leopold , although they still favored a monarchy rather than a republic . Many Greeks , seeking closer ties to the pre @-@ eminent world power , Great Britain , rallied around Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert . British Foreign Minister Lord Palmerston believed that the Greeks were " panting for increase in territory " , hoping for a gift of the Ionian Islands , which were then a British protectorate . The London Conference of 1832 , however , prohibited any of the Great Powers ' ruling families from accepting the crown , and in any event , Queen Victoria was adamantly opposed to the idea . The Greeks nevertheless insisted on holding a plebiscite in which Prince Alfred received over 95 % of the 240 @,@ 000 votes . There were 93 votes for a Republic and 6 for a Greek . King Otto received one vote . 
 With Prince Alfred 's exclusion , the search began for an alternative candidate . The French favored Henri d 'Orléans , duc d <unk> , while the British proposed Queen Victoria 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Ernest II , Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg , her nephew Prince Leiningen , and Archduke Maximilian of Austria , among others . Eventually , the Greeks and Great Powers winnowed their choice to Prince William of Denmark , who had received 6 votes in the plebiscite . Aged only 17 , he was elected King of the Hellenes on 30 March [ O.S. 18 March ] 1863 by the Greek National Assembly under the regnal name of George I. Paradoxically , he ascended a royal throne before his father , who became King of Denmark on 15 November the same year . There were two significant differences between George 's elevation and that of his predecessor , Otto . First , he was acclaimed unanimously by the Greek Assembly , rather than imposed on the people by foreign powers . Second , he was proclaimed " King of the Hellenes " instead of " King of Greece " , which had been Otto 's style . 
 His ceremonial enthronement in Copenhagen on 6 June was attended by a delegation of Greeks led by First Admiral and Prime Minister Constantine <unk> . Frederick VII awarded George the Order of the Elephant , and it was announced that the British government would cede the Ionian Islands to Greece in honor of the new monarch . 
 = = Early reign = = 
 The new 17 @-@ year @-@ old king toured Saint Petersburg , London and Paris before departing for Greece from the French port of Toulon on 22 October aboard the Greek flagship Hellas . He arrived in Athens on 30 October [ O.S. 18 October ] 1863 , after docking at Piraeus the previous day . He was determined not to make the mistakes of his predecessor , so he quickly learned Greek . The new king was seen frequently and informally in the streets of Athens , where his predecessor had only appeared in pomp . King George found the palace in a state of disarray , after the hasty departure of King Otto , and took to putting it right by mending and updating the 40 @-@ year @-@ old building . He also sought to ensure that he was not seen as too influenced by his Danish advisers , ultimately sending his uncle , Prince Julius , back to Denmark with the words , " I will not allow any interference with the conduct of my government " . Another adviser , Count Wilhelm <unk> , became unpopular for advocating a policy of disarmament and tactlessly questioning the descent of modern Greeks from classical antecedents . Like Julius , he was dispatched back to Denmark . 
 From May 1864 , George undertook a tour of the Peloponnese , through Corinth , Argos , Tripolitsa , Sparta , and Kalamata , where he embarked on the frigate Hellas . Proceeding northwards along the coast accompanied by British , French and Russian naval vessels , the Hellas reached Corfu on 6 June , for the ceremonial handover of the Ionian Islands by the British High Commissioner , Sir Henry Storks . 
 Politically , the new king took steps to conclude the protracted constitutional deliberations of the Assembly . On 19 October 1864 , he sent the Assembly a demand , countersigned by Constantine <unk> , explaining that he had accepted the crown on the understanding that a new constitution would be finalized , and that if it was not he would feel himself at " perfect liberty to adopt such measures as the disappointment of my hopes may suggest " . It was unclear from the wording whether he meant to return to Denmark or impose a constitution , but as either event was undesirable the Assembly soon came to an agreement . 
 On 28 November 1864 , he took the oath to defend the new constitution , which created a unicameral assembly ( <unk> ) with representatives elected by direct , secret , universal male suffrage , a first in modern Europe . A constitutional monarchy was set up with George deferring to the legitimate authority of the elected officials , although he was aware of the corruption present in elections and the difficulty of ruling a mostly illiterate population . Between 1864 and 1910 , there were 21 general elections and 70 different governments . 
 Internationally , George maintained a strong relationship with his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Albert Edward , Prince of Wales ( eventually King Edward VII of the United Kingdom ) , and sought his help in defusing the recurring and contentious issue of Crete , an overwhelmingly Greek island that remained under Ottoman Turk control . Since the reign of Otto , the Greek desire to unite Greek lands in one nation had been a sore spot with the United Kingdom and France , which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main Greek port Piraeus to dissuade Greek irredentism during the Crimean War . During the Cretan Revolt ( 1866 – 1869 ) , the Prince of Wales sought the support of British Foreign Secretary Lord Derby to intervene in Crete on behalf of Greece . Ultimately , the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion . 
 = = Marriage and children = = 
 George first met Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia in 1863 , when she was 12 years old , on a visit to the court of Tsar Alexander II between his election to the Greek throne and his arrival in Athens . They met for a second time in April 1867 , when George went to the Russian Empire to visit his sister Dagmar , who had married into the Russian imperial family . While George was a Lutheran , the Romanovs were Orthodox Christians like the majority of Greeks , and George thought a marriage with a Russian grand duchess would re @-@ assure his subjects on the question of his future children 's religion . Olga was just 16 years old when she married George in Saint Petersburg on 27 October 1867 . After a honeymoon at Tsarskoye Selo , the couple left Russia for Greece on 9 November . Over the next twenty years , they had eight children : 
 Constantine ( 1868 – 1923 ) , who married Princess Sophia of Prussia ; 
 George ( 1869 – 1957 ) , who married Princess Marie Bonaparte ; 
 Alexandra ( 1870 – 1891 ) , who married Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia ; 
 Nicholas ( 1872 – 1938 ) , who married Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia ; 
 Maria ( 1876 – 1940 ) , who married firstly Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia and secondly Admiral Perikles <unk> ; 
 Olga ( 1880 ) , who died aged seven months ; 
 Andrew ( 1882 – 1944 ) , who married Princess Alice of Battenberg and was the father of Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh ; and 
 Christopher ( 1888 – 1940 ) , who married firstly American widow Nancy Stewart Worthington Leeds and secondly Princess Françoise of Orléans . 
 As a marriage gift , the Tsar gave George a group of islands in the <unk> Gulf , which the family visited on the royal yacht Amphitrite . George later purchased a country estate , Tatoi , north of Athens , and on Corfu he built a summer villa called Mon Repos . George developed Tatoi , building roads and planting grapes for making his own wine , Chateau <unk> . Intent on not letting his subjects know that he missed Denmark , he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at Tatoi , which was managed by native Danes and served as a bucolic reminder of his homeland . Queen Olga was far less careful in hiding her nostalgia for her native Russia , often visiting Russian ships at Piraeus two or three times before they weighed anchor . When alone with his wife , George usually conversed in German . Their children were taught English by their nannies , and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English . 
 The King was related by marriage to the rulers of Great Britain , Russia and Prussia , maintaining a particularly strong attachment to the Prince and Princess of Wales , who visited Athens in 1869 . Their visit occurred despite continued lawlessness which culminated in the kidnap of a party of British and Italian tourists , including Lord and Lady <unk> . Two female hostages , a child and Lord <unk> were released , but four of the others : British diplomat E. H. C. Herbert ( the first cousin of Lord Carnarvon ) , Frederick Vyner ( the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Lord Ripon , Lord President of the Council ) , Italian diplomat Count <unk> di <unk> , and Mr. Lloyd ( an engineer ) were murdered . George 's relationships with other ruling houses assisted him and his small country but also often put them at the center of national political struggles in Europe . 
 From 1864 to 1874 , Greece had 21 governments , the longest of which lasted a year and a half . In July 1874 , Charilaos Trikoupis , a member of the Greek Parliament , wrote an anonymous article in the newspaper <unk> blaming King George and his advisors for the continuing political crisis caused by the lack of stable governments . In the article , he accused the King of acting like an absolute monarch by imposing minority governments on the people . If the King insisted , he argued , that only a politician commanding a majority in the <unk> could be appointed prime minister , then politicians would be forced to work together more harmoniously in order to construct a coalition government . Such a plan , he wrote , would end the political instability and reduce the large number of smaller parties . Trikoupis admitted to writing the article after a man supposed by the authorities to be the author was arrested , whereupon he was taken into custody himself . After a public outcry , he was released and subsequently acquitted of the charge of " undermining the constitutional order " . The following year , the King asked Trikoupis to form a government ( without a majority ) and then read a speech from the throne declaring that in future the leader of the majority party in parliament would be appointed prime minister . 
 = = Territorial expansion = = 
 Throughout the 1870s , Greece kept pressure on the Ottoman Empire , seeking territorial expansion into Epirus and Thessaly . The Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 1878 provided the first potential alliance for the Greek kingdom . George 's sister Dagmar was the daughter @-@ in @-@ law of Alexander II of Russia , and she sought to have Greece join the war . The French and British refused to countenance such an act , and Greece remained neutral . At the Congress of Berlin convened in 1878 to determine peace terms for the Russo @-@ Turkish War , Greece staked a claim to Crete , Epirus and Thessaly . 
 The borders were still not finalized in June 1880 when a proposal very favorable to Greece that included Mount Olympus and Ioannina was offered by the British and French . When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected , Prime Minister Trikoupis made the mistake of threatening a mobilization of the Hellenic Army . A coincident change of government in France , the resignation of Charles de Freycinet and his replacement with Jules Ferry , led to disputes among the Great Powers and , despite British support for a more pro @-@ Greek settlement , the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around Arta . When the government of Trikoupis fell , the new prime minister , Alexandros <unk> , reluctantly accepted the new boundaries . 
 While Trikoupis followed a policy of retrenchment within the established borders of the Greek state , having learned a valuable lesson about the vicissitudes of the Great Powers , his main opponents , the Nationalist Party led by Theodoros Deligiannis , sought to inflame the anti @-@ Turkish feelings of the Greeks at every opportunity . The next opportunity arose in 1885 when Bulgarians rose in revolt in Eastern Rumelia and united the province with Bulgaria . Deligiannis rode to victory over Trikoupis in elections that year saying that if the Bulgarians could defy the Treaty of Berlin , so should the Greeks . 
 Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army , and the British Royal Navy blockaded Greece . The admiral in charge of the blockade was Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863 , and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon , whose brother @-@ in @-@ law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before . This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage . Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership . Between 1882 and 1897 , Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell .

 George 's silver jubilee in 1888 was celebrated throughout the Hellenic world , and Athens was decorated with garlands for the anniversary of his accession on 30 October . Visitors included the Crown Prince of Denmark , the Prince and Princess of Wales , the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh , Grand Dukes Sergei and Paul of Russia , and Djevad Pasha from the Ottoman Empire , who presented the King with two Arabian horses as gifts . Jubilee events in the week of 30 October included balls , galas , parades , a thanksgiving service at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens , and a lunch for 500 invited guests in a blue and white tent on the Acropolis . 
 Greece in the last decades of the 19th century was increasingly prosperous and was developing a sense of its role on the European stage . In 1893 , the Corinth Canal was built by a French company cutting the sea journey from the Adriatic Sea to Piraeus by 150 miles ( 241 km ) . In 1896 , the Olympic Games were revived in Athens , and the Opening Ceremony of the 1896 Summer Olympics was presided over by the King . When Spiridon Louis , a shepherd from just outside Athens , ran into the Panathinaiko Stadium to win the Marathon event , the Crown Prince ran down onto the field to run the last thousand yards beside the Greek gold medalist , while the King stood and applauded . 
 The popular desire to unite all Greeks within a single territory ( <unk> Idea ) was never far below the surface and another revolt against Turkish rule erupted in Crete . In February 1897 , King George sent his son , Prince George , to take possession of the island . The Greeks refused an Ottoman offer of an autonomous administration , and Deligiannis mobilized for war . The Great Powers refused to allow the expansion of Greece , and on 25 February 1897 announced that Crete would be under an autonomous administration and ordered the Greek and Ottoman Turk militias to withdraw . 
 The Turks agreed , but Prime Minister Deligiannis refused and dispatched 1400 troops to Crete under the command of Colonel Timoleon <unk> . While the Great Powers announced a blockade , Greek troops crossed the Macedonian border and Abdul Hamid II declared war . The announcement that Greece was finally at war with the Turks was greeted by delirious displays of patriotism and spontaneous parades in honor of the King in Athens . Volunteers by the thousands streamed north to join the forces under the command of Crown Prince Constantine . 
 The war went badly for the ill @-@ prepared Greeks ; the only saving grace was the swiftness with which the Hellenic Army was overrun . By the end of April 1897 , the war was lost . The worst consequences of defeat for the Greeks were mitigated by the intervention of the King 's relations in Britain and Russia ; nevertheless , the Greeks were forced to give up Crete to international administration , and agree to minor territorial concessions in favor of the Turks and an indemnity of 4 million Turkish pounds . 
 The jubilation with which Greeks had hailed their king at the beginning of the war was reversed in defeat . For a time , he considered abdication . It was not until the King faced down an assassination attempt on 27 February 1898 with great bravery that his subjects again held their monarch in high esteem . Returning from a trip to the beach at Phaleron in an open carriage , George and his daughter Maria were shot at by two riflemen . The King tried to shield his daughter ; both were unhurt though the coachman and a horse were wounded . The gunmen ( an Athens clerk called <unk> and his assistant ) fled into the Hymettus hills but they were spotted and arrested . Both were beheaded at Nauplia . 
 Later that year , after continued unrest in Crete , which included the murder of the British vice @-@ consul , Prince George of Greece was made the Governor @-@ General of Crete under the suzerainty of the Sultan , after the proposal was put forward by the Great Powers . Greece was effectively in day @-@ to @-@ day control of Crete for the first time in modern history . 
 = = Later reign and assassination = = 
 The death of Britain 's Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901 left King George as the second @-@ longest @-@ reigning monarch in Europe . His always cordial relations with his brother @-@ in @-@ law , the new King Edward VII , continued to tie Greece to Britain . This was abundantly important in Britain 's support of King George 's son Prince George as Governor @-@ General of Crete . Nevertheless , Prince George resigned in 1906 after a leader in the Cretan Assembly , Eleftherios Venizelos , campaigned to have him removed . 
 As a response to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 , Venizelos 's power base was further strengthened , and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios <unk> and the objections of the Great Powers . The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland . 
 A group of military officers formed a military league , <unk> <unk> , that demanded that the royal family be stripped of their military commissions . To save the King the embarrassment of removing his sons from their commissions , they resigned them . The military league attempted a coup d 'état called the <unk> <unk> , and the King insisted on supporting the duly elected Hellenic Parliament in response . Eventually , the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution . King George gave way , and new elections to the revising assembly were held . After some political maneuvering , Venizelos became prime minister of a minority government . Just a month later , Venizelos called new elections at which he won a colossal majority after most of the opposition parties declined to take part . 
 Venizelos and the King were united in their belief that the nation required a strong army to repair the damage of the humiliating defeat of 1897 . Crown Prince Constantine was reinstated as Inspector @-@ General of the Army , and later Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . Under his and Venizelos 's close supervision the military was retrained and equipped with French and British help , and new ships were ordered for the Hellenic Navy . Meanwhile , through diplomatic means , Venizelos had united the Christian countries of the Balkans in opposition to the ailing Ottoman Empire . 
 When Montenegro declared war on Turkey on 8 October 1912 , it was joined quickly by Serbia , Bulgaria , and Greece in what is known as the First Balkan War . George was on vacation in Denmark , so he immediately returned to Greece via Vienna , arriving in Athens to be met by a large and enthusiastic crowd on the evening of 9 October . The results of this campaign differed radically from the Greek experience at the hands of the Turks in 1897 . The well @-@ trained Greek forces , 200 @,@ 000 strong , won victory after victory . On 9 November 1912 , Greek forces commanded by Crown Prince Constantine rode into Thessaloniki , just a few hours ahead of a Bulgarian division . Three days later King George rode in triumph through the streets of Thessaloniki , the second @-@ largest Greek city , accompanied by the Crown Prince and Venizelos . 
 As he approached the fiftieth anniversary of his accession , the King made plans to abdicate in favor of his son Constantine immediately after the celebration of his golden jubilee in October 1913 . Just as he did in Athens , George went about Thessaloniki without any meaningful protection force . While out on an afternoon walk near the White Tower on 18 March 1913 , he was shot at close range in the back by Alexandros Schinas , who was " said to belong to a Socialist organization " and " declared when arrested that he had killed the King because he refused to give him money " . George died instantly , the bullet having penetrated his heart . The Greek government denied any political motive for the assassination , saying that Schinas was an alcoholic vagrant . Schinas was tortured in prison and six weeks later fell to his death from a police station window . 
 The King 's body was taken to Athens on the Amphitrite , escorted by a flotilla of naval vessels . For three days the coffin of the King , draped in the Danish and Greek flags , lay in the Metropolis in Athens before his body was committed to a tomb at his palace in Tatoi . Unlike his father , the new king , Constantine , was to prove less willing to accept the advice of ministers , or that of the three protecting powers ( Britain , France and Russia ) .

 The distinctive Greek flag of blue and white cross was first hoisted during the Greek War of Independence in March 1822 . This was later modified so that the shade of blue matched that of the Bavarian coat of arms of the first King of Greece , Otto .

 = James Planché = 
 James Robinson Planché ( 27 February 1796 – 30 May 1880 ) was a British dramatist , antiquary and officer of arms . Over a period of approximately 60 years he wrote , adapted , or collaborated on 176 plays in a wide range of genres including extravaganza , farce , comedy , <unk> , melodrama and opera . Planché was responsible for introducing historically accurate costume into nineteenth century British theatre , and subsequently became an acknowledged expert on historical costume , publishing a number of works on the topic . 
 Planché 's interest in historical costume led to other antiquarian research , including heraldry and genealogy . He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1829 , and was influential in the foundation of the British Archaeological Association in 1843 . Appointed Rouge Croix Pursuivant in 1854 and promoted to Somerset Herald in 1866 , Planché undertook heraldic and ceremonial duties as a member of the College of Arms . These included proclaiming peace at the end of the Crimean War and investing foreign monarchs with the Order of the Garter . 
 = = Early and personal life = = 
 James Robinson Planché was born in Old Burlington St , Piccadilly , London in 1796 to Jacques Planché and Catherine Emily Planché . His parents were first cousins and descendants of Huguenot refugees who had fled to England in 1685 following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes . Jacques Planché was a moderately prosperous watchmaker , a trade he had learned in Geneva , and was personally known to King George III . His name was pronounced " plank " or " <unk> " for the beginning of his life , but he added , or rather re @-@ added , the accent to his name , restoring the French pronunciation . However , after doing this , editors would sometimes jab at Planché writing " that a particular work of ' Mr. Plank ' was ' wooden ' " . 
 Planché was educated at home until the age of eight by his mother ( who had written a treatise on education ) . He was then sent to boarding school where , in his words : " I was <unk> , and <unk> the French I spoke fluently as a child . " In 1808 he was apprenticed to a French landscape painter , Monsieur de Court , however this was curtailed by the latter 's death two years later . Planché was then articled as an apprentice to a bookseller , with the hope that this would also give him the opportunity to sell some of his own writings . 
 During this period he joined an amateur theatre company , in which he acted and wrote plays . The manuscript of one of these early plays , Amoroso , King of Little Britain , was by chance seen by the comic actor John Pritt Harley , who , recognising its potential , brought about ( and acted in ) its performance at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane . Its favourable reception launched Planché on his theatrical career . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 On 26 April 1821 , Planché married Elizabeth St George , a playwright . She wrote The Welsh Girl for the Olympic Theatre shortly after its opening in 1831 and , emboldened by its successful reception , continued to write for the stage . Among her more successful plays were A Handsome Husband and A Pleasant Neighbour , both at the Olympic , and The Sledge Driver and The Ransom , both produced at the Haymarket Theatre . From viewing their plays , it 's thought that they collaborated , as he excelled in " playful dialog " , and she excelled in " sentimental and melodramatic scenes " . Elizabeth Planché died in 1846 after a long illness . The couple had two daughters , Katherine Frances , born in 1823 , and Matilda Anne , born in 1825 . Katherine married William Curteis Whelan of <unk> Hall , Tenterden , Kent in 1851 . 
 Matilda achieved success as an author of children 's books ( using the pen name Susie Sunbeam ) , beginning in 1849 with A Trap to Catch a Sunbeam , which subsequently went through 42 editions . She married the Rev. Henry Mackarness in 1852 , and with him had eleven children , four of whom did not survive infancy . Taking after her father in terms of writing output , Matilda Mackarness produced an average of one book a year until her death , most of them under her married name . Her husband 's death in 1868 left her with little means of supporting her family , as the books did not produce much income . She and her children moved in with her father . 
 = = Life = = 
 Despite his large number of successful plays , Planché was never particularly wealthy , and he felt pressure from needing to support his grandchildren . Circumstances improved when in 1871 he was awarded a civil list pension of £ 100 per annum ' in recognition of his literary services ' . Planché died at his home in Chelsea on 30 May 1880 at the age of 84 . His wealth at the time of his death was under £ 1000 . 
 Planché " greatly enjoyed moving in society and meeting the well @-@ known " . He was a regular attender at <unk> , breakfasts and <unk> where he " met and was introduced to most of the <unk> then living in London " . In 1831 he was a founding member of the Garrick Club . His autobiography contains many anecdotes of his acquaintances in theatrical and literary circles . Planché was also much esteemed in private life . 
 = = Theatrical career = = 
 = = = Early career and libretti = = = 
 Planché 's career as a playwright began , as already mentioned , in 1818 when Amoroso , King of Little Britain , a play he had written for an amateur performance at a private theatre , was seen by John Pritt Harley and subsequently performed at Drury Lane . The play was a success and Harley , along with Stephen Kemble and Robert William Elliston , encouraged Planché to take up play @-@ writing full @-@ time . Planché did so ; his next play to be performed was a pantomime at Christmas of that same year . A further six of his plays were performed in 1819 , the same number in 1820 , and eleven in 1821 , most of these at the Adelphi Theatre , but also including some at the Lyceum , the Olympic and Sadler 's Wells . Planché 's early works were " generally unremarkable " , one exception in this period being The Vampire , or , The Bride of the Isles , produced at the Lyceum in August 1820 , an adaptation of Charles Nodier 's Le Vampire ( this was a dramatisation of John Polidori 's novel The Vampyre ) . The play featured the innovative " vampire trap " , a trapdoor in the stage which allowed an actor to disappear ( or appear ) almost instantly . Kenilworth Castle , or , the Days of Queen Bess , produced 8 February 1821 , was also very successful . Planché wrote a total of 176 plays . 
 Planché held the position of stock author ( in @-@ house writer ) at the Adelphi for a short period in 1821 , before moving to a similar position at the Theatre Royal , Covent Garden . In 1822 he wrote the libretto ( and some of the music ) for his first full @-@ scale opera , Maid Marian ; or , the Huntress of Arlingford . In 1826 he wrote the libretto for another opera , Oberon , or the Elf @-@ King 's Oath , the final work of composer Carl Maria von Weber , who died a few months after its completion . While this opera was a commercial success and received a favourable critical response at the time , subsequent critics have not appreciated Planché 's libretto . 
 In 1838 Planché was to collaborate on an opera with another notable composer , Felix Mendelssohn . Mendelssohn originally approved of Planché 's choice of topic , Edward III 's siege of Calais in the Hundred Years War , and responded positively to the first two acts of the libretto . But , after Mendelssohn received the final act , he expressed doubts about the subject , asked Planché to start work on a completely new libretto , and eventually stopped replying to Planché 's letters . The opera was never realised . 
 = = = Historical costume , dramatic copyright , tableaux vivants = = = 
 In August 1823 , in an issue of The Album , he published an article saying that more attention should be paid to the time period of Shakespeare 's plays , especially when it comes to costumes . In the same year , a casual conversation led to one of Planché 's more lasting effects on British theatre . He observed to Charles Kemble , the manager of Covent Garden , that " while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle , the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery , and , at the best , a new dress or two for the principal characters " . Kemble " saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town " , and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of King John , if he would carry out the research , design the costumes and superintend the production . Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as Francis Douce and Sir Samuel Meyrick . The research involved sparked Planché 's latent antiquarian interests ; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life . 
 Despite the actors ' reservations , King John was a success and led to a number of similarly @-@ costumed Shakespeare productions by Kemble and Planché ( Henry IV , Part I , As You Like It , Othello , Cymbeline , Julius Caesar ) . The designs and renderings of King John , Henry IV , As You Like It , Othello , Hamlet and Merchant of Venice were published , though there is no evidence that Hamlet and Merchant of Venice were ever produced with Planché 's historically accurate costume designs . Planché also wrote a number of plays or adaptations which were staged with historically accurate costumes ( Cortez , The Woman Never Vext , The Merchant 's Wedding , Charles XII , The Partisans , The Brigand Chief , and Hofer ) . After 1830 , although he still used period costume , he no longer claimed historical accuracy for his work in plays . His work in King John had brought about a " revolution in nineteenth @-@ century stage practice " , which lasted for almost a century . 
 In 1828 Planché left Covent Garden and went to work for Stephen Price at Drury Lane . His first play during this period , Charles XII , was staged in December of that year and was a great success . Prior to its publication ( which would have allowed any theatre to produce it without charge ) , Planché received an enquiry from Murray , the manager of the Theatre Royal , Edinburgh who wished to stage the piece . Planché named a " modest sum " of £ 10 for the privilege which Murray said he could not pay , citing the poor financial situation of his theatre . But he acquired a manuscript copy of the play and staged it without permission . 
 This prompted Planché to begin campaigning for copyright to be extended to dramatic works . He gathered a group of dramatists ( including John Poole , James Kenney , Joseph Lunn and Richard Brinsley Peak ) who prevailed upon writer and MP George Lamb to introduce a bill in Parliament ; but the bill did not pass its third reading . In 1832 Edward Bulwer @-@ Lytton , a novelist and MP , was successful in getting a select committee set up to consider dramatic copyright , as well as theatrical censorship and the monopoly of the patent theatres on drama . Planché gave evidence before the select committee ; the following year the Dramatic Copyright Act 1833 ( 3 Will IV c . 15 ) was passed . 
 In the production of his The Brigand , Planché created tableaux vivants of three recent paintings by Charles Eastlake : An Italian Brigand Chief <unk> , The Wife of a Brigand Chief Watching the Result of a Battle , and The Dying Brigand . This feature was a success and widely copied . Paintings inspired his work in a number of other plays . For The Golden Branch ( 1847 ) and Love and Fortune ( 1859 ) , he created costumes based on the paintings of Watteau . The latter play , which was subtitled A Dramatic Tableau ( in Watteau Colours ) , also included a tableau from Watteau 's Noces de Village .

 After a brief period as acting @-@ manager of the Adelphi Theatre , Planché moved to the Olympic Theatre when Lucia Vestris took over the management in 1831 . He provided the first play which she produced , Olympic Revels , or , Prometheus and Pandora . This began a professional relationship which lasted over two decades . Planché went with Vestris and her husband , Charles Mathews , when they took over management of Covent Garden in 1839 , then with them to Drury Lane in 1842 . From 1843 he spent four years at the Haymarket with Benjamin Webster , before returning to Vestris and Matthews at the Lyceum , where he stayed until leaving London in 1852 . During his time with Vestris , he undertook the roles of " playwright , librettist , general advisor and superintendent of the decorative departments " . 
 Olympic Revels was Planché 's first example of " that form of <unk> which is commonly described as ' classical ' — which deals with the characteristics and adventures of gods and goddesses , heroes and heroines , of the Greek and Latin mythology and fable " , a genre of which he was later credited as originator . Planché used costume for comedic effect , not by the costumes being comic , but by the incongruity of realistic historical dress being juxtaposed with the actions of the actors . For example , Olympic Revels opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing whist . By 1836 these classical burlesques had become so popular that other writers were copying them . 
 Feeling the need to do something different , Planché turned to a translation of the féerie folie ( French : fairy tale ) Riquet à la Houppe , which he had written some years earlier . The play was a success , and became the first of 23 " fairy extravaganzas " , most of which were based on the fairy tales of Madame d 'Aulnoy . Planché 's fascination with her work led the press to refer to him as Madame d 'Aulnoy 's " <unk> chevalier " ( French : devoted knight ) and similar epithets . Planché 's coined the term " extravaganza " , defining it as " the whimsical treatment of a poetical subject " . 
 In 1879 two of his friends published his extravaganzas , together with some of his other works , as a five @-@ volume set , entitled The Extravaganzas of J. R. Planché , esq . , ( Somerset Herald ) 1825 – 1871 . The fairy tales were not originally children 's stories , but sophisticated works intended for an adult audience . Planché 's scholarly approach was exhibited in this area as well ; he " translated two volumes of fairy tales by Mme D 'Aulnoy , Perrault , and others , which were for the first time given in their integrity with biographical and historical notes and dissertations . " 
 Borrowing from the French again , Planché introduced the revue ( or review ) to British theatre , as a commentary on recent events , particularly events in the theatre . His first revue , Success ; or , a hit if you like it , was produced in 1825 . He wrote another seven over the next 30 years , a peak of four in the years 1853 – 1855 . 
 = = = Retirement and legacy = = = 
 Planché semi @-@ retired from the theatre in 1852 and went to live in Kent with his younger daughter ( although he returned to London two years later on his appointment as Rouge Croix Pursuivant ) . He continued to write occasionally for the theatre , but only produced 16 more pieces between 1852 and 1871 . 
 Critics writing at the end of the nineteenth century praised Planché with sentiments such as " [ Planché ] raised theatrical extravaganza and burlesque to the dignity of a fine art , and wrote verses to be sung on the stage which could be read with pleasure in the study . " and " I am quite certain that such masters of lyrical writing as W. S. Gilbert ... would confirm me in my opinion that the songs and lyrics in the extravaganzas of Planché were as faultless in tone , tact and taste as they were rhythmically perfect " . ( The converse was also true ; Planché approved of , and strongly influenced Gilbert 's works ) Planché 's dramatic reputation was already fading before his death , and continued to do so in the twentieth century . He is still remembered for his influence on and contributions to British theatre over a long career . 
 = = Antiquarian career = = 
 Planché 's research to determine historically accurate costume for the 1823 production of King John led to his developing a strong interest in the subject . When he published his first major work in 1834 , History of British Costume from the Earliest Period to the Close of the 18th Century , Planché described it as " the result of ten years ' diligent devotion to its study of every leisure hour left me by my professional engagements " . Prior to this Planché had published his costume designs for King John and the other Shakespeare plays , with " biographical , critical and explanatory notices " . After travelling twice to the Continent , he wrote about his journeys in Lays and Legends of the Rhine ( 1826 ) and Descent of the Danube ( 1827 ) . 
 Planché 's scholarship was recognised by his appointment in 1829 as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London . He was a regular attendee at the Society 's meetings and contributed to the Society 's journal , Archaeologia . He became dissatisfied with the Society 's management , complaining of " the lethargy into which the Society of Antiquaries had fallen , the dreariness of its meetings , the want of interest in its communications and the reluctance of its council to listen to any suggestions for its improvement " . In 1843 – 4 Planché was involved in the foundation of the British Archaeological Association , of which he was later Vice @-@ President , and for more than twenty years the Secretary . Planché resigned his membership of the Society of Antiquaries in 1852 , in which year he also moved to Kent to live with his younger daughter . 
 Besides his History of British Costume , Planché contributed to a number of other works on costume . He wrote an article on " The History of Stage Costume " in The Book of Table Talk , edited by Charles MacFarlane , in 1836 . He also provided the chapters on costume and furniture for The Pictorial History of England by MacFarlane and George Craik , as well as an introduction on costume for most of the plays in The Pictorial Edition of the Works of Shakespeare by Charles Knight . In 1842 – 3 Planché edited Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England and A Complete View of the Dresses and Habits of the People of England by Joseph Strutt . In 1848 he contributed " Remarks on some of his sketches for Masques and dramas " to Peter Cunningham 's Inigo Jones : A Life of the Architect . In 1879 Planché completed his most ambitious work on costume history , A Cyclopedia of Costume , or , Dictionary of Dress , two volumes totalling almost 1000 pages . 
 Planché 's expertise in historical dress was not only of interest to his fellow antiquarians . During her reign Queen Victoria held a number of <unk> <unk> at which the attendees had to wear costume of a specified era . Planché 's advice was much in demand in the periods leading up to these balls as invited guests had costumes made . 
 His antiquarian interests also included armour . In 1834 he published A Catalogue of the Collection of Ancient Arms and Armour , the property of Bernard <unk> , with a prefatory notice . In 1857 Planché was invited to arrange the collection of armour formerly belonging to his friend Sir Samuel Meyrick for the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester , a task which he repeated in South Kensington in 1868 . Concerned by the state of the armour in the Tower of London , Planché wrote several reports on the subject between 1855 and 1869 . In that year , the War Office invited him to rearrange the collection in chronological order , which was one of the things for which he had been campaigning . 
 Among his works on other topics were two with royal connections — Regal Records , or a Chronicle of the Coronation of the Queens <unk> of England , prompted by the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1837 , and The Conqueror and his Companions , written in 1874 . 
 Planché 's personal life inspired two works . In 1864 he published A Corner of Kent , or some account of the parish of Ash @-@ next @-@ Sandwich , the result of three years ' work on what was originally intended as a short guidebook to antiquities within the parish of his son @-@ in @-@ law , the Rev. Henry Mackarness . In 1872 he published his autobiography , a two @-@ volume work entitled The Recollections and Reflections of J.R. Planché ( Somerset herald ) : a professional biography , containing many anecdotes of his life in the theatre . 
 In addition , Planché produced over 100 papers and articles on a wide range of topics . His obituary in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association mentions in passing such topics as the following : 
 Naval uniforms of Great Britain , early armorial bearings , processional weapons , horn @-@ shaped headdresses of the thirteenth , fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , the clarion , the Stanley crest , ancient and medieval tapestries , armorials of <unk> and Peverel , the <unk> monuments at Ashbourne , the tilting and other helmets , the family of Giffard , the Earls of <unk> ( the Lords of Chepstow ) , relics of Charles I , the Earls and Dukes of Somerset , the statuary of the west front of Wells Cathedral , various effigies , brasses and portraits , the first Earl of Norfolk , the family of <unk> , monuments in Shrewsbury Abbey , the Neville monuments , the Earls of Sussex , of Gloucester and of Hereford , and the Fairford windows . 
 = = Heraldic career = = 
 His antiquarian studies led Planché to take an interest in heraldry . He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms , or , Heraldry founded upon facts . As indicated by the subtitle , Planché was concerned with verifiable facts , as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers . In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner , Planché rewrote the early history of heraldry . 
 Two years later a vacancy occurred at the College of Arms , the office responsible for administering English heraldic affairs . Planché was offered , and accepted , the position of Rouge Croix Pursuivant , one of the four junior @-@ most officers of arms . Some years previously he had indicated his interest in becoming an officer of arms , should a vacancy arise , to the Duke of Norfolk , who as Earl Marshal is responsible for the College of Arms . Planché was also an acquaintance of Charles Young , Garter King of Arms , the principal officer of arms at the College . 
 Planché moved back to London on becoming Rouge Croix . For three years from the end of 1856 , he focused on the duties of his new office and his scholarly pursuits . Planché 's new office also carried with it ceremonial duties . On four occasions he was part of diplomatic missions to invest foreign monarchs with the Order of the Garter : to King Pedro V of Portugal in 1858 , and his successor King Luis in 1865 , to Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria in 1867 and to King Umberto I of Italy in 1878 . Planché also participated in state ceremonial within England ; in 1856 he and other officers of arms proclaimed peace following the conclusion of the Crimean War . This was supposed to take place " according to precedent " , but the ' stage management ' of the event left something to be desired ; among other things the gates at Temple Bar , where the officers of arms customarily demand entry to the City of London , were left open . 
 In 1866 Planché was promoted to the office of Somerset Herald . For most of that year he was engaged in editing Clarke 's Introduction to Heraldry . During his heraldic duties , Planché came across a hitherto @-@ neglected manuscript in the collections of the College of Arms ; this became known as " Planché 's Roll " , since he was the first to draw attention to it . He also left another heraldic legacy ; Ursula Cull , the wife of future Garter King of Arms Sir George Bellew , was a descendent of Planché 's daughter Matilda . 
 = = = Coat of arms = = = 
 Planché was granted arms in 1857 , a few years after his appointment as Rouge Croix pursuivant . These are blazoned : 
 ( Arms ) Vert a Tower Proper between three <unk> Argent each charged with a Cross Gules . 
 ( Crest ) A Demi @-@ Lion rampant guardant Argent billetty Gules holding between the paws a silver <unk> charged as in the arms 
 ( Motto ) En <unk> la vérité 
 The <unk> Argent charged with a Cross Gules ( white circles with a red cross ) allude to the badge of office of Rouge Croix . Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate , and the crest alone on his writing paper . When he was promoted to Somerset Herald , Planché surrounded the crest on his writing paper with a collar of <unk> . While he was entitled to the collar by his appointment as herald , its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual .

 = 1954 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1954 Atlantic hurricane season resulted in over $ 750 million in damage , the most of any season at the time . The season officially began on June 15 , and nine days later the first named storm developed . Hurricane Alice developed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved inland along the Rio Grande , producing significant precipitation and record flooding that killed 55 people . Activity was slow until late August ; only Barbara , a minimal tropical storm , developed in July . In the span of two weeks , hurricanes Carol and Edna followed similar paths before both striking New England as major hurricanes . The latter became the costliest hurricane in Maine 's history . 
 In late September , Tropical Storm Gilda killed 29 people after drenching northern Honduras . A tropical depression in early October was captured by a high @-@ altitude photograph on a rocket , thus producing the first large @-@ scale image of a tropical cyclone . The strongest and deadliest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Hazel , which killed thousands in Haiti before striking near the North Carolina / South Carolina border in October . It caused heavy damage in the United States before becoming extratropical and affecting Ontario . Intense rainfall affected Toronto with severe flooding , leaving significant damage . The season officially ended on November 15 , although another hurricane named Alice developed on December 30 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles ; it lasted until January 6 of the following year . In total , there were 16 tropical storms , 7 hurricanes , and 3 major hurricanes . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 = = Storms = = 
 The hurricane season officially began on June 15 , when the United States Weather Bureau in Miami , Florida began 24 ‑ hour operations . The agency , under the direction of Grady Norton had access to 43 other weather stations across the Atlantic basin . Norton died during the season from a stroke while tracking Hurricane Hazel . Additionally , a group of Hurricane Hunters planes were put on standby for the season , able to be flown out into storms and collect data . During the season , there were eight named storms , as well as an unnamed hurricane and a tropical depression . The season officially ended on November 15 , although an unnamed tropical storm formed a day later . In addition , Tropical Storm Alice developed on December 31 , the latest a tropical cyclone has developed in the calendar year . 
 Cumulatively , tropical cyclones left 193 deaths and $ 756 million in damage , becoming the costliest hurricane season at the time . The season was one of six to have three major hurricanes strike the country , along with 2005 ( which had four ) , 1893 , 1909 , 1933 , and 2004 . Two of the major hurricanes – Carol and Edna – struck New England ; this occurred despite an average of only 5 – 10 New England hurricanes per century . Carol struck Connecticut as a hurricane and left widespread heavy damage . Only ten days later , Edna became the costliest hurricane in Maine 's history . The third major hurricane , Hazel , was the strongest hurricane of the season , attaining winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . Unusually , no tropical cyclones affected Florida . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 113 , which is categorized as being " above normal " . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm One = = = 
 A broad trough developed over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on May 26 . A frontal disturbance formed over Florida along the trough , spawning an area of broad cyclonic turning . After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean , a closed circulation developed within the system , and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed on May 28 about 100 mi ( 160 km ) east of Jacksonville , Florida . Ship observations in the region suggested that the depression intensified into a tropical storm by late on May 28 . The system was small , and was not discovered to have been a tropical cyclone until a reanalysis of data in 2015 . The storm moved to the northeast ahead of an approaching trough , bypassing the Carolinas to the east ; rainfall brushed the coast of North Carolina . On May 29 , ship observations suggested peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . On the next day , the storm became associated with a warm front , indicating that it became extratropical to the southeast of New England . Continuing to the northeast , the former storm crossed over the southeastern coast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by another nontropical low to the northwest on May 31 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Two = = = 
 A trough formed over southern Florida on June 17 . Early the next day , a circulation formed , signaling that a tropical depression also developed over the Everglades . The system moved slowly north @-@ northeastward , emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at 06 : 00 UTC on June 20 . Shortly thereafter , the depression intensified into a tropical storm , although the structure was broad and asymmetric due to association with a nearby upper @-@ level low , signaling that the system was possibly a subtropical cyclone . Ship reports in the region indicate that the storm continued to intensify . On June 22 , the structure became much more symmetrical while passing just off the Outer Banks , bringing winds of 33 mph ( 54 km / h ) to Wilmington , North Carolina . That day , the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , and is possible that the storm briefly attained hurricane status . The peak winds were estimated at 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , due to a pressure reading of 994 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) . The storm accelerated northeastward due to an approaching cold front . On June 24 , the storm became extratropical , and shortly thereafter made landfall along southwestern Nova Scotia . The system dissipated the next day over the northern Gulf of Saint Lawrence . 
 = = = Hurricane Alice ( June ) = = = 
 On June 24 , a tropical storm and later hurricane rapidly developed in the western Gulf of Mexico , giving the citizens of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico little time to prepare . Hurricane Alice rapidly intensified to at least a strong Category 2 storm ( similar to 2010 's Hurricane Alex , moved ashore in northeastern Mexico and quickly weakened , producing minor damage and killing one person due to a fallen power line . 
 On June 26 , Alice dissipated , although the system dropped torrential rainfall across southern Texas and northeastern Mexico . The maximum rainfall officially peaked at 24 @.@ 07 in ( 611 mm ) near Pandale , Texas , concentrated in an area around the Pecos River . High precipitation accumulations occurred in areas that had seen little rains in three years . This led to significant flooding along the Pecos River that produced " probably the greatest rate of runoff for a watershed of [ that ] size in the United States " , as reported by the International Boundary and Water Commission . Ozona , Texas sustained the most impact , estimated at $ 2 million in damage . Downstream , the Rio Grande rose to the highest level since 1865 , which flooded seven towns on either side of the border ; Eagle Pass , Texas was flooded with 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) of water . Overall there were at least 55 deaths . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Four = = = 
 A dissipating cold front stalled over the southeastern United States from Arkansas to North Carolina on July 9 . On the next day , a low pressure area developed along the coast of Georgia . Soon after , the front dissipated , and by 12 : 00 UTC on July 10 , the system developed into a tropical storm . Observations from a coastal lighthouse and a nearby ship indicated that the storm attained peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) while moving slowly east @-@ northeastward , just offshore the Carolinas . The storm began weakening on July 13 , and dissipated the next day when it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm that was developing to the north . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Barbara = = = 
 On July 27 , a tropical depression developed in the northern Gulf of Mexico , about 100 mi ( 160 km ) south of Grand Isle , Louisiana . A map of the low pressure areas forming in July 1954 indicated that the system originated near the Mississippi Delta and tracked southward . After forming , the depression tracked northwestward , intensifying into Tropical Storm Barbara early on July 28 . Maximum sustained winds reached 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) , although a tanker offshore named the Henry M. Dawes reported wind gusts of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . Officials at the United States Weather Bureau posted a storm warning from Cameron to Burrwood , Louisiana , and also advised small craft to remain at port along the entire northern Gulf Coast . Without intensifying further , Barbara made landfall near Vermilion Bay , Louisiana on July 29 , dissipating the next day over Texas . The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path , including over 2 in ( 51 mm ) in New Orleans . The rains caused flooding as well as some damage to the rice crop . However , the Monthly Weather Review yearly summary described the precipitation as " far more beneficial than damaging " . There was no wind damage . 
 = = = Hurricane Carol = = = 
 Carol developed from a tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 25 . It quickly intensified as it tracked generally to the north , becoming a hurricane on August 27 . Moving parallel to the coastline of the southeastern United States , Carol passed just east of Cape Hatteras with winds estimated at 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . It intensified further as it accelerated , striking eastern Long Island as Category 3 hurricane . Carol made its final landfall on Old Saybrook , Connecticut late on August 31 . Within a few hours , the hurricane became extratropical over New Hampshire , which later dissipated over Quebec . 
 In North Carolina , hurricane @-@ force winds left minor damage to houses , estimated around $ 228 @,@ 000 . Rains from Carol alleviated drought conditions in the Washington , D.C. area . On Long Island , the storm surge flooded the Montauk Highway with 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) of water about a mile across . High winds left 275 @,@ 000 homes without power , and damage totaled $ 3 million on the island . 
 The hurricane moved ashore in Connecticut shortly after high tide , producing a storm surge of 10 – 15 ft ( 3 – 4 @.@ 5 m ) from New London eastward . The surge in Narragansett Bay reached 14 @.@ 4 ft ( 4 @.@ 4 m ) , which surpassed that of the 1938 New England hurricane , which flooded downtown Providence with 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) of water . In New London , rainfall peaked around 6 in ( 150 mm ) . The hurricane produced winds of over 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) in Connecticut and Rhode Island , including a record @-@ high gust of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) at Block Island . Widespread areas were left without power from eastern Connecticut to southern Massachusetts . Further north in Maine , Hurricane Carol downed hundreds of trees , as well as destroying widespread apple groves and corn fields . It became the costliest natural disaster in the state 's history , only to be surpassed by Hurricane Edna ten days later . Across New England , the hurricane destroyed about 4 @,@ 000 homes , 3 @,@ 500 cars , and 3 @,@ 000 boats . Damage totaled $ 460 million , and there were 60 deaths . In neighboring Canada , high rains caused flooding while strong winds downed trees and power lines . 
 = = = Hurricane Dolly = = = 
 A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on August 31 to the northwest of Puerto Rico . It moved rapidly north @-@ northwestward , intensifying into Tropical Storm Dolly later that day and into a hurricane early on September 1 . Early in the storm 's duration , the U.S. Weather Bureau noted the potential for Dolly to affect the same areas of New England that Hurricane Carol struck just days prior . However , the hurricane turned to the north away from land . The Hurricane Hunters estimated maximum sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) on September 2 after the storm passed about halfway between the Outer Banks and Bermuda . Dolly turned to the northeast on September 2 and became extratropical later that day to the south of Nova Scotia . It was tracked until September 4 , until it was last located to the north of the Azores . There was no reported damage . 
 = = = Hurricane Edna = = = 
 As Dolly became extratropical , the tropical depression that later became Hurricane Edna developed east of the Lesser Antilles on September 2 . It moved northwestward , dropping heavy rainfall on Puerto Rico as it passed north of the island . On September 7 Edna became a hurricane , and the next day reached peak winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . It turned to the north and northeast , bypassing the Outer Banks and skirting Cape Cod . On September 11 , Edna struck Massachusetts as a strong Category 2 hurricane . The hurricane later moved ashore near the border between Maine and New Brunswick around the time it became extratropical . The remnants persisted a few more days before dissipating south of Greenland . 
 Early in its duration , Edna produced high seas and gale force winds in the Bahamas , but there was no damage there . Hurricane force winds occurred in the Outer Banks , although damage was minor . As it passed New England , Edna produced a 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) storm surge during a high tide , which caused severe flooding in Martha 's Vineyard , Nantucket , and Cape Cod . Wind gusts peaked at 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) on Martha 's Vineyard , and the strong winds across the region left widespread power outages . The hurricane dropped additional heavy rainfall to areas affected by Carol , resulting in flooding in Massachusetts and Rhode Island . In Long Island and New England , the hurricane left over $ 42 million in damage and 20 deaths , only 11 days after Carol affected the same area . About a third of the damage occurred in Maine , becoming the costliest hurricane on record in the state . Hurricane force winds extended into Canada , causing $ 6 million in damage ( 1954 CAD ) , mostly from crop damage . There was one death in Nova Scotia .
