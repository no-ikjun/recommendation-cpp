 " Dancehall Queen " was written by Klas Åhlund , who produced the song with Diplo . The piece is a dancehall song , with influences of reggae . The song incorporates 1980s dancehall synths and subwoofer wobbles . Nate Chinen of The New York Times called the song " an ode to 1990s Euro @-@ dub " . Noel Gardner of Drowned in Sound called it a " modern equivalent " of 10cc 's " <unk> Holiday " . The song utilizes electrified Caribbean sounds , influenced by Ace of Base . According to Ben Norman of About.com , Robyn " <unk> her way through a laid back and bouncy electronic atmosphere " . The chorus features Robyn singing " I still run this thing like a dancehall queen / I really don 't want no hassle . " The song also includes a shoutout to <unk> Teng ; " I came to dance , not to socialize . " According to Marc Hogan of Pitchfork , the song 's title is a " sideways allusion " to ABBA .

 Marc Hogan of Pitchfork called the song a " so @-@ wrong @-@ it 's @-@ right collaboration with <unk> Philadelphia DJ / producer Diplo . " Hogan wrote that " It 's here , dancing , with a chorus that Santigold and Gwen Stefani might kill for , that Robyn is free from all the worries that are " killing " her at the album 's start . " Christopher Muther of The Boston Globe wrote that " [ Robyn 's ] take on Jamaican music has the potential to reek of day @-@ old Ace of Bass " , but called it " surprisingly solid " . Noel Gardner of Drowned in Sound called it " frankly peculiar " , and wrote , " It ’ s evidently laced with irony , and is possibly the most fun tune on here " . Luke Lewis of NME wrote a mixed review of the song , stating , " It feels less authentic , especially on ‘ Dancefloor Queen ’ , a misfiring collaboration with Diplo that features the least convincing patois this side of a George Lamb radio show . " 
 Ben Norman of About.com wrote , " Nothing against ' Dancehall Queen , ' but it just isn 't the Robyn people have come to love . " Robbie Daw of Idolator called it " subtle " , and wrote that " it ’ s hard to imagine this song being worked as a single " , but concluded saying that it " definitely has an infectious hook " . Anthony <unk> of Consequence of Sound wrote that the song " is what you ’ d expect to hear : a smooth beat and an international sound , but nothing you ’ ll keep on repeat .

 The music video for " Dancehall Queen " was directed by Diplo , Red Foxx and Pomp & Clout . It premiered on 29 November 2010 via Robyn 's official YouTube account . Ryan <unk> of Pomp & Clout referred the video to as a " really weird VHS / karaoke video " . The video resembles a faded karaoke tape with occasional sing @-@ along lyrics on the bottom of the screen . Robyn does not appear in the video . Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork said that the video is " complete with awkward / sexy dancing and footage of bustling city life " . Erika Brooks Adickman of Idolator wrote a mixed review of the clip , stating , " We ’ re guessing Robyn didn ’ t want the “ hassle ” of appearing , so instead we ’ re treated to — seemingly — random grainy footage of the streets of Japan and gyrating women as the words of the chorus appear karaoke @-@ style on the screen . We can say one good thing about the flick , if you were confused about the song ’ s lyrics , they ’ re fairly easy to read . "

 = Royal assent = 
 Royal assent is the method by which a country 's constitutional monarch ( possibly through a delegated official ) formally approves an act of that nation 's parliament , thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law . In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies , this act is considered to be little more than a formality ; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent ( such as the United Kingdom , Norway , and Liechtenstein ) , the monarch almost never does so , save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government . While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies , it is exceedingly rare in the modern , democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century . 
 Royal assent is sometimes associated with elaborate ceremonies . In the United Kingdom , for instance , the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners , who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose . However , royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent . In other nations , such as Australia , the Governor @-@ General merely signs the bill . In Canada , the Governor @-@ General may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament of his or her agreement to the bill . 
 = = Commonwealth realms = = 
 = = = United Kingdom = = = 
 In the United Kingdom , royal assent is the final step required for a parliamentary bill to become law . Once a bill is presented to the sovereign or the sovereign 's representative , he or she has three formal options : Firstly , the sovereign may grant royal assent , thereby making the bill an Act of Parliament . Secondly , the sovereign may withhold royal assent , thereby vetoing the bill . Finally , the sovereign may reserve ; that is to say , defer a decision on the bill until a later time . 
 Under modern constitutional conventions , the sovereign acts on the advice of his or her ministers . Since these ministers most often maintain the support of parliament and are the ones who obtain the passage of bills , it is highly improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent . An exception is sometimes stated to be if bills are not passed in good faith , though it is difficult to make an interpretation on what this circumstance might constitute . Hence , in modern practice , royal assent is always granted ; a refusal to do so would be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch 's reserve powers . 
 = = = = Historical development = = = = 
 Originally , legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the Curia Regis , or Royal Council , in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament . The so @-@ called Model Parliament included bishops , abbots , earls , barons , and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough among its members . In 1265 , the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation . The body eventually came to be divided into two branches : bishops , abbots , earls , and barons formed the House of Lords , while the shire and borough representatives formed the House of Commons . The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law . During Henry VI 's reign , it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills , which would not become law unless the sovereign 's assent was obtained , as the sovereign was , and still remains , the enactor of laws . Hence , all acts include the clause " Be it enacted by the Queen 's ( King 's ) most Excellent Majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal , and Commons , in this present Parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows ... " . The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process . 
 The power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs . Charles I dissolved parliament in 1629 , after it passed motions critical of and bills seeking to restrict his arbitrary exercise of power . During the eleven years of personal rule that followed , Charles performed legally dubious actions , such as raising taxes without parliament 's approval . After the English Civil War , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills . In 1678 , Charles II withheld his assent from a bill " for preserving the Peace of the Kingdom by raising the Militia , and continuing them in Duty for Two and Forty Days , " suggesting that he , not parliament , should control the militia . The last Stuart monarch , Anne , similarly withheld on 11 March 1708 , on the advice of her ministers , her assent from a bill for the settling of Militia in Scotland . No monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by the British parliament . 
 During the rule of the succeeding Hanoverian dynasty , power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government . The first Hanoverian monarch , George I , relied on his ministers to a greater extent than did previous monarchs . Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation : George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath , which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy . However , George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers . Thus , as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved , the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse , both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms . 
 In 1914 , George V did take legal advice on withholding royal assent from the Government of Ireland Bill , a highly contentious piece of legislation that the Liberal government intended to push through parliament by means of the Parliament Act 1911 . The King decided that he should not withhold assent without " convincing evidence that it would avert a national disaster , or at least have a <unk> effect on the distracting conditions of the time " .

 Royal assent is the final stage in the legislative process for acts of the Scottish parliament . The process is governed by sections 28 , 32 , and 33 of the Scotland Act 1998 . After a bill has been passed , the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament submits it to the monarch for royal assent after a four @-@ week period , during which the Advocate General for Scotland , the Lord Advocate , the Attorney General or the Secretary of State for Scotland may refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ( prior to 1 October 2009 , the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ) for review of its legality . Royal assent is signified by letters patent under the Great Seal of Scotland in the following form which is set out in The Scottish Parliament ( Letters Patent and Proclamations ) Order 1999 ( SI 1999 / 737 ) and of which notice is published in the London , Edinburgh , and Belfast <unk> :

 The lieutenant governors of the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey do not grant royal assent . The States of Jersey Law 2005 abolished any power of the lieutenant governor to veto a resolution of the states . 
 Instead , the monarch directly grants royal assent by Order in Council . Assent is granted or refused on the advice of the Lord Chancellor . A recent example when assent was refused ( or , more correctly , when the Lord Chancellor declined to present the law for assent ) was in 2007 , concerning reforms to the constitution of the Chief Pleas of Sark . ( A revised version of the proposed reforms was subsequently given assent . ) In 2011 , campaigners against a law that sought to reduce the number of senators in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse royal assent . An Order in Council of 13 July 2011 established new rules for the consideration of petitions against granting royal assent . 
 Laws require royal assent ; other legislation such as ordinances ( in Guernsey ) and regulations and orders ( in Jersey ) do not require royal assent . 
 There is a proposal that the Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey should be granted the power of Royal Assent to enable laws to be granted approval within six weeks if no objection was raised rather than refer every law to London . " At present there is a situation where Channel Island law @-@ making depends , ultimately , on the UK government of the day , unelected [ sic ] by the islands . " 
 = = = = = Isle of Man = = = = = 
 Special procedures apply to legislation passed by Tynwald , the legislature of the Isle of Man . Before the lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 ( the <unk> ) , the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the governor . After 1765 , royal assent was at first signified by letter from the Secretary of State to the governor ; but , during the British Regency , the practice began of granting royal assent by Order in Council , which continues to this day , though limited to exceptional cases since 1981 . 
 In 1981 , an Order in Council delegated to the lieutenant governor the power to grant royal assent to bills passed by Tynwald . The lieutenant governor must refer any bill to the then Lord Chancellor 's Department ( now Ministry of Justice ) for advice , on which he is required to act , and certain types of bill are reserved to the monarch , in which case the former procedure is followed . 
 Royal assent is not sufficient to give legal effect to an Act of Tynwald . By ancient custom , an act did not come into force until it had been promulgated at an open @-@ air sitting of Tynwald , usually held on Tynwald Hill at St John 's on St John 's Day ( 24 June ) , but , since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1753 , on 5 July ( or on the following Monday if 5 July is a Saturday or Sunday ) . Promulgation originally consisted of the reading of the Act in English and Manx ; but , after 1865 the reading of the title of the act and a summary of each section were sufficient . This was reduced in 1895 to the titles and a memorandum of the object and purport of the act , and , since 1988 , only the short title and a summary of the long title have been read . 
 An emergency procedure enabling an act to come into force on Royal Assent being announced at an ordinary sitting of Tynwald , subject to its being promulgated within 12 months , was introduced in 1916 ; since 1988 , this has been the normal procedure and an act ceases to have effect unless promulgated within 18 months after royal assent is announced in Tynwald . 
 Since 1993 , the Sodor and Man Diocesan Synod has had power to enact measures making provision " with respect to any matter concerning the Church of England in the Island " . If approved by Tynwald , a measure " shall have the force and effect of an Act of Tynwald upon the Royal Assent thereto being announced to Tynwald " . Between 1979 and 1993 , the Synod had similar powers , but limited to the extension to the Isle of Man of measures of the General Synod . Before 1994 , royal assent was granted by Order in Council , as for a bill , but the power to grant royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the lieutenant governor . A Measure does not require promulgation . 
 = = = = British overseas territories = = = = 
 The governors ( or lieutenant governors ) of British overseas territories grant or refuse the royal assent for territorial legislation . They may also reserve a bill to allow the sovereign to make a personal decision . When Hong Kong was under British rule , bills passed by the Legislative Council were required constitutionally to have royal assent signified by the governor . 
 = = = Other Commonwealth realms = = = 
 In Commonwealth realms other than the UK , royal assent is granted or withheld either by the realm 's sovereign or , more frequently , by the representative of the sovereign , the governor @-@ general . In federated realms , assent in each state , province , or territory is granted or withheld by the representatives of the sovereign . In Australia , this is the governors of the states , administrators of the territories , or the governor @-@ general in the Australian Capital Territory . For Canada , this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces . A lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general , and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign . 
 If the Governor General of Canada is unable to give assent , it can be done by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada — the Chief Justice of Canada — or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada . It is not actually necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature , the signature being merely an attestation . In each case , the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law . Two methods are available : the sovereign 's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament ; alternatively , each house may be notified separately , usually by the speaker of that house . However , though both houses must be notified on the same day , notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons , whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general 's letter read aloud by the speaker . 
 At both state and federal realms in Australia , assent is used as the means of enforcing a referendum that is required . This is done by providing that it will not be lawful to even submit the law for viceregal assent unless and until it has been approved by the required percentage of the voting populace at a referendum .

 While royal assent has not been withheld in the United Kingdom since 1708 , it has often been withheld in British colonies and former colonies by governors acting on royal instructions . In the United States Declaration of Independence , colonists complained that George III " has refused his Assent to Laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good [ and ] has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them . " Even after colonies such as Canada , Australia , New Zealand , the Union of South Africa , and Newfoundland were granted responsible government , the British government continued to sometimes advise governors @-@ general on the granting of assent ; assent was also occasionally reserved to allow the British government to examine a bill before advising the governor @-@ general . 
 Since the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931 , the all Commonwealth realms have been sovereign kingdoms , the monarch and governors @-@ general acting solely on the advice of the local ministers who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills . They , therefore , are unlikely to advise the sovereign or his or her representative to withhold assent . The power to withhold the royal assent was exercised by Alberta 's lieutenant governor , John C. Bowen , in 1937 , in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by William Aberhart 's Social Credit party . Two bills sought to put banks under the authority of the province , thereby interfering with the federal government 's powers . The third , the Accurate News and Information Bill , purported to force newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the provincial cabinet objected . The unconstitutionality of all three bills was later confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council . 
 In Australia , a technical issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001 . In 1976 , a bill originating in the House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor @-@ General and assented to . However , it was later discovered that it had not been passed by each house . The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the house . The Governor @-@ General revoked the first assent , before assenting to the bill which had actually passed . The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001 . 
 = = = Ceremony = = = 
 = = = = United Kingdom = = = = 
 In the United Kingdom , a bill is presented for royal assent after it has passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords . Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 , the House of Commons may , under certain circumstances , direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords . Officially , assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent . It may be granted in parliament or outside parliament ; in the latter case , each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect . 
 The Clerk of the Parliaments , an official of the House of Lords , traditionally states a formula in Anglo @-@ Norman Law French , indicating the sovereign 's decision . The granting of royal assent to a supply bill is indicated with the words " La Reyne <unk> ses bons <unk> , <unk> leur benevolence , et <unk> le <unk> " , translated as " The Queen thanks her good subjects , accepts their bounty , and wills it so . " For other public or private bills , the formula is simply " La Reyne le <unk> " ( " the Queen wills it " ) . For personal bills , the phrase is " <unk> fait comme il est <unk> " ( " let it be as it is desired " ) . The appropriate formula for withholding assent is the euphemistic " La Reyne s <unk> " ( " the Queen will consider it " ) . When the sovereign is male , Le Roy is substituted for La Reyne . 
 Before the reign of Henry VIII , the sovereign always granted his or her assent in person . The sovereign , wearing the Imperial State Crown , would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber , surrounded by heralds and members of the royal court — a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament . The Commons , led by their speaker , would listen from the Bar of the Lords , just outside the chamber . The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch , save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker . The Clerk of the Crown , standing on the sovereign 's right , then read aloud the titles of the bills ( in earlier times , the entire text of the bills ) . The Clerk of the Parliaments , standing on the sovereign 's left , responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula . 
 A new device for granting assent was created during the reign of King Henry VIII . In 1542 , Henry sought to execute his fifth wife , Catherine Howard , whom he accused of committing adultery ; the execution was to be authorised not after a trial but by a bill of attainder , to which he would have to personally assent after listening to the entire text . Henry decided that " the repetition of so grievous a Story and the recital of so infamous a crime " in his presence " might reopen a Wound already closing in the Royal Bosom " . Therefore , parliament inserted a clause into the Act of Attainder , providing that assent granted by Commissioners " is and ever was and ever shall be , as good " as assent granted by the sovereign personally . The procedure was used only five times during the 16th century , but more often during the 17th and 18th centuries , especially when George III 's health began to deteriorate . Queen Victoria became the last monarch to personally grant assent in 1854 . 
 When granting assent by commission , the sovereign authorises three or more ( normally five ) lords who are Privy Counsellors to grant assent in his or her name . The Lords Commissioners , as the monarch 's representatives are known , wear scarlet parliamentary robes and sit on a bench between the throne and the Woolsack . The Lords Reading Clerk reads the commission aloud ; the senior commissioner then states , " My Lords , in obedience to Her Majesty 's Commands , and by virtue of the Commission which has been now read , We do declare and notify to you , the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament assembled , that Her Majesty has given Her Royal Assent to the several Acts in the Commission mentioned . " 
 During the 1960s , the ceremony of assenting by commission was discontinued and is now only employed once a year , at the end of the annual parliamentary session . In 1960 , the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod arrived to summon the House of Commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend the ceremony . The debacle was repeated in 1965 ; this time , when the Speaker left the chair to go to the House of Lords , some members continued to make speeches . As a result , the Royal Assent Act 1967 was passed , creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent . As the attorney @-@ general explained , " there has been a good deal of resentment not only at the loss of Parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption of a debate that may be caused . " The granting of assent by the monarch in person , or by commission , is still possible , but this third form is used on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis . 
 Under the Royal Assent Act 1967 , royal assent can be granted by the sovereign in writing , by means of letters patent , that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament . Then , the presiding officer makes a formal , but simple statement to the house , acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned . Thus , unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners , the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent . The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office ( Forms and Proclamations Rules ) Order 1992 , with minor amendments in 2000 . In practice this remains the standard method , a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act ( " ... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent ... " ) . 
 When the act is assented to by the sovereign in person , or by empowered Royal Commissioners , royal assent is considered given at the moment when the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled . When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed , assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses , having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent , have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent . Thus , if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time ( for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date ) , assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made . This is important because , under British Law , unless there is any provision to the contrary , an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed , or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house , but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent . 
 Independently of the method used to signify royal assent , it is the responsibility of the Clerk of the Parliaments , once the assent has been duly notified to both houses , not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula , but to certify that assent has been granted . The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date ( in English ) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act . When an act is published , the signature of the clerk is omitted , as is the Norman French formula , should the endorsement have been made in writing . However , the date on which the assent was notified is printed in brackets . 
 = = = = In the other Commonwealth realms = = = = 
 In Commonwealth realms , assent may be granted by the sovereign in person , by the governor @-@ general in person , or by a deputy acting for the governor @-@ general . In all of the realms , however , assent is more often granted or signified outside the legislature , with each house being notified separately . 
 In Australia , the formal ceremony of granting assent in parliament has not been regularly used since the early 20th century . Now , the bill is sent to the governor @-@ general 's residence by the house in which it originated . The governor @-@ general then signs the bill , sending messages to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives , who notify their respective houses of the governor @-@ general 's action .

One result , conceived as part of a string of royal duties intended to demonstrate Canada 's status as an independent kingdom , was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian parliament during the 1939 royal tour of Canada — 85 years after his great @-@ grandmother , Queen Victoria , had last granted royal assent personally in the United Kingdom . Under the Royal Assent Act 2002 , however , the alternative practice of granting assent in writing , with each house being notified separately ( the Speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the Governor @-@ General regarding the written declaration of Royal Assent ) , was brought into force . As the act also provides , royal assent is to be signified — by the governor general , or , more often , by a deputy , usually a Justice of the Supreme Court , at least twice each calendar year : for the first appropriation measure and for at least one other act , usually the first non @-@ appropriation measure passed . However , the act provides that a grant of royal assent is not rendered invalid by a failure to employ the traditional ceremony where required . 
 The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate , as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons . On the day of the event , the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive . The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony . The speaker moves to sit beside the throne , the Mace Bearer , with mace in hand , stands adjacent to him or her , and the governor general enters to take the speaker 's chair . The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament , who follow Black Rod back to the Senate , the Sergeant @-@ at @-@ Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons . In the Senate , those from the commons stand behind the bar , while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general , who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills ( which do not include appropriations bills ) . Once the list of bills is complete , the Clerk of the Senate states : " in Her Majesty 's name , His [ or Her ] Excellency the Governor General [ or the deputy ] doth assent to these bills . " If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent , the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general , who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent . When these bills have all been assented to , the Clerk of the Senate recites " in Her Majesty 's name , His [ or Her ] Excellency the Governor General [ or the deputy ] thanks her loyal subjects , accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills . " The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament .

 In some monarchies — such as Belgium , Denmark , Japan , Malaysia , the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , and Thailand — promulgation is required as well as royal assent . In other monarchies — such as Sweden — the government officially promulgates laws . In both cases , however , the process of royal assent is usually ceremonial , whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution . 
 = = = Belgium = = = 
 In Belgium , the royal assent is called sanction royale / <unk> <unk> ( Royal Sanction ) , and is granted by the King signing the proposed statute . The Belgian constitution requires a theoretically possible refusal of royal sanction to be countersigned — as any other act of the monarch — by a minister responsible before the House of Representatives . The monarch promulgates the law , meaning that he or she formally orders that the law be officially published and executed . In 1990 , when King Baudouin advised his cabinet he could not , in conscience , sign a bill <unk> abortion ( a refusal patently not covered by a responsible minister ) , the Council of Ministers , at the King 's own request , declared Baudouin incapable of exercising his powers . In accordance with the Belgian constitution , upon the declaration of the sovereign 's incapacity , the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King 's incapacity and appoint a regent . The bill was then assented to by all members of the Council of Ministers " on behalf of the Belgian People " . In a joint meeting , both houses of parliament declared the King capable of exercising his powers again the next day .

 The constitution of Jordan grants its monarch the right to withhold assent to laws passed by its parliament . Article 93 of that document gives the Jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent to him from the National Assembly ; if he vetoes it within that timeframe , the assembly may override his veto by a two @-@ thirds vote of both houses ; otherwise , the law does not go into effect ( but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly ) . If the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill being presented to him , it becomes law without his signature .

 Liechtenstein allows its monarch to withhold royal assent of his or her own will . When Prince Hans Adam II , in an unprecedented move for the constitutional monarchy , refused to give royal assent to a bill legalising abortion , he pushed for a bill to give him sweeping powers in the government beyond only ceremonial matters , including the power to appoint judges . The bill passed and the Prince now has many additional powers , including the power to withhold royal assent on his own accord .

 While the constitution of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess ' sanction on a new law for it to take effect , this right was removed in 2008 , after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister that he could not in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country . Following this , the Grand @-@ Duke 's signature is still required , but does not imply assent , only promulgation ( announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament ) . The Grand @-@ Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement . 
 = = = The Netherlands = = = 
 Royal assent in the Netherlands is required , under article 87 of the Dutch constitution , for a bill to become law . After a law has been approved by the Council of Ministers and has received a positive advice from the advisory Council of State , the government then sends it to the lower house of parliament in the name of the monarch with the following text : 
 Aan de Tweede Kamer der Staten @-@ Generaal 
 Wij <unk> U <unk> ter <unk> aan een <unk> van wet <unk> [ topic of the law ] in <unk> met [ reason and purpose of the law ] 
 De <unk> van <unk> ( en <unk> ) die het <unk> <unk> , <unk> de <unk> <unk> het rust .

 [ location and date ] [ signed Willem @-@ Alexander ] . 
 To the Second Chamber of the States General 
 <unk> We offer to You for consideration a proposal of law containing [ topic of the law ] in relation to [ reason and purpose of the law ] 
 The explanatory memorandum ( and addenda ) that accompanies the proposal of law , contains the grounds on which it is based . 
 And herewith We command You in God 's holy protection . 
 [ location and date ] [ signed Willem @-@ Alexander ] . 
 After the House of Representatives has debated the law , it either approves it and sends it to the Senate with the text " The Second Chamber of the States General sends the following approved proposal of law to the First Chamber " , or it rejects it and returns it to the government with the text " The Second Chamber of the States General has rejected the accompanying proposal of law . " If the upper house then approves the law , it sends it back to the government with the text " To the King , The States General have accepted the proposal of law as it is offered here . " 
 The government , consisting of the monarch and the ministers , will then usually approve the proposal and the sovereign and one of the ministers signs the proposal with the addition of an enacting clause , thereafter notifying the States General that " The King assents to the proposal . " It has happened in exceptional circumstances that the government does not approve a law that has been passed in parliament . In such a case , neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the bill , notifying the States General that " The King will keep the proposal under advisement . " A law that has received royal assent will be published in the State Magazine , with the original being kept in the archives of the King 's Offices . 
 = = = Norway = = = 
 Articles 77 – 79 of the Norwegian Constitution specifically grant the monarch of Norway the right to withhold royal assent from any bill passed by the Storting . Should the sovereign ever choose to exercise this privilege , Article 79 provides a means by which his veto may be over @-@ ridden : " If a Bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the Storting , constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the Storting , without a divergent Bill having been passed by any Storting in the period between the first and last adoption , and it is then submitted to the King with a petition that His Majesty shall not refuse his assent to a Bill which , after the most mature deliberation , the Storting considers to be beneficial , it shall become law even if the Royal Assent is not accorded before the Storting goes into recess . " 
 = = = Spain = = = 
 Title IV of the 1978 Spanish constitution invests the <unk> Real ( Royal Assent ) and promulgation ( publication ) of laws with the monarch of Spain , while Title III , The Cortes Generales , Chapter 2 , Drafting of Bills , outlines the method by which bills are passed . According to Article 91 , within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the Cortes Generales , the sovereign shall give his or her assent and publish the new law . Article 92 invests the monarch with the right to call for a referendum , on the advice of the president of the government ( commonly referred to in English as the prime minister ) and the authorisation of the <unk> . 
 No provision within the constitution grants the monarch an ability to veto legislation directly ; however , no provision prohibits the sovereign from withholding royal assent , which effectively constitutes a veto . When the Spanish media asked King Juan Carlos if he would endorse the bill legalising same @-@ sex marriages , he answered " Soy el Rey de España y no el de <unk> " ( " I am the King of Spain and not that of Belgium " ) — a reference to King Baudouin I of Belgium , who had refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion . The King gave royal assent to Law 13 / 2005 on 1 July 2005 ; the law was gazetted in the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 2 July and came into effect on 3 July 2005 . Likewise , in 2010 , King Juan Carlos gave royal assent to a law permitting abortion on demand . 
 If the Spanish monarch ever refused in conscience to grant royal assent , a procedure similar to the Belgian handling of King Baudouin 's objection would not be possible under the current constitution . If the sovereign were ever declared incapable of discharging royal authority , his or her powers would not be transferred to the Cabinet , pending the parliamentary appointment of a regency . Instead , the constitution mandates the next person of age in the line of succession would immediately become regent . Therefore , had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010 , a declaration of incapacity would have transferred power to Felipe , then the heir apparent .

 Articles 41 and 68 of the constitution empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly . In 2010 , the kingdom moved towards greater democracy , with King George <unk> V saying that he would be guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers . Nonetheless , this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto . In November 2011 , the assembly adopted an Arms and <unk> ( Amendment ) Bill , which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms . The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight . Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms . The Prime Minister , Lord <unk> , voted in favour of the amendment . Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it , which he did in December . 
 = Bretagne @-@ class battleship = 
 The Bretagne @-@ class battleships were the first " super @-@ dreadnoughts " built for the French Navy during the First World War . The class comprised three vessels : Bretagne , the lead ship , Provence , and Lorraine . They were an improvement of the previous Courbet class , and mounted ten 340 mm ( 13 @.@ 4 in ) guns instead of twelve 305 mm ( 12 in ) guns as on the Courbets . A fourth was ordered by the Greek Navy , though work was suspended due to the outbreak of the war . The three completed ships were named after French provinces . 
 The three ships saw limited service during World War I , and were primarily occupied with containing the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea . After the war , they conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean and participated in non @-@ intervention patrols off Spain during the Spanish Civil War . After the outbreak of World War II , the ships were tasked with convoy duties and anti @-@ commerce raider patrols until the fall of France in June 1940 . Bretagne and Provence were sunk by the British Royal Navy during the Attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir the following month ; Provence was later raised and towed to Toulon , where she was again scuttled in November 1942 . Lorraine was disarmed by the British in Alexandria and recommissioned in 1942 to serve with the Free French Naval Forces . She provided gunfire support during Operation Dragoon , the invasion of southern France , and shelled German fortresses in northern France . She survived as a gunnery training ship and a floating barracks until the early 1950s , before being broken up for scrap in 1954 . Bretagne and Provence were scrapped in 1952 and 1949 , respectively .

 By 1910 , France had yet to lay down a single dreadnought battleship ; Britain had by then completed ten dreadnoughts and five battlecruisers , with eight and three more of the two types , respectively , under construction . Germany had built eight dreadnoughts and one battlecruiser and the United States had six built and four more building . Late that year , the French Navy laid down the first of the four Courbet class ships . To remedy the inferiority of the French fleet , the government passed the <unk> Naval on 30 March 1912 , authorizing a force of twenty @-@ eight battleships , to be in service by 1920 . The first three ships were to be laid down in 1912 . 
 The Bretagne class were replacements for the battleships Carnot , Charles Martel and Liberté . They were developed from the Courbet class , and were built with the same hulls . The primary reason for the decision to use the same hull design as the Courbet class was limitations of French shipyards . The Courbet @-@ class ships were the largest possible ships that could fit in existing dockyards and refitting basins . The Conseil supérieur de la Marine ( CSM ) , the French naval high command , ordered the construction department to prepare designs for a 23 @,@ 500 @-@ metric @-@ ton ( 23 @,@ 100 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 25 @,@ 900 @-@ short @-@ ton ) ship armed with twelve 340 mm ( 13 in ) guns in six twin gun turrets . 
 The additional weight of the 340 mm turrets compared to the 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) of the Courbet @-@ class ships imposed insurmountable problems for the designers . To incorporate six turrets with the same arrangement of the earlier vessels , with four on the centerline in superfiring pairs and two wing turrets amidships would have required an additional 3 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 000 long tons ) displacement as well as a significant increase in the length of the hull . After several other proposals , the CSM chose a design with five twin turrets , all mounted on the centerline . This would achieve the same broadside of ten guns , despite the reduction in the number of guns . The width of the armored belt was reduced by 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) to compensate for the increased weight of the main battery . 
 Provence was the first ship of the class to be laid down , which she was on 21 May 1912 at the Arsenal de Lorient . Bretagne was laid down at the Arsenal de Brest shipyard in Brest on 22 July 1912 . Lorraine followed at the Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire shipyard in St. Nazaire almost six months later on 7 November 1912 . Due to the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914 , French industrial capacity was redirected to the army and work slowed on the ships . The Greek Navy ordered a battleship to be named Vasilefs Konstantinos to the same design from AC de St Nazaire <unk> . Work began in June 1914 but ceased on the outbreak of war in August and never resumed . The contract dispute was settled in 1925 . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The ships were 164 @.@ 9 meters ( 541 ft ) long at the waterline and 166 m ( 545 ft ) long overall . They had a beam of 26 @.@ 9 m ( 88 ft ) and a draft of between 8 @.@ 9 m ( 29 ft ) and 9 @.@ 8 m ( 32 ft ) . At the designed load , the ships displaced 23 @,@ 936 metric tons ( 23 @,@ 558 long tons ) , and at full combat load , this increased to 26 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 26 @,@ 000 long tons ) . The crew included 34 officers , 139 petty officers , and 1 @,@ 020 enlisted men , for a total crew of 1 @,@ 193 . The vessels carried a number of smaller boats , including two 10 m ( 33 ft ) steamboats , three 11 m ( 36 ft ) patrol boats , one 13 m ( 43 ft ) long boat , three 10 @.@ 5 m ( 34 ft ) dinghies , two 5 m ( 16 ft ) dinghies , two 8 @.@ 5 m ( 28 ft ) whaleboats , and two 5 @.@ 6 m ( 18 ft ) lifeboats . 
 The ships ' propulsion systems consisted of four Parsons steam turbines . Bretagne was equipped with twenty @-@ four Niclausse boilers ; Lorraine had the same number of Belleville boilers . Provence was equipped with eighteen Guyot du Temple boilers . All three ships were coal @-@ fired . The turbines each drove a single screw and were rated at a total of 29 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 22 @,@ 000 kW ) . This provided a top speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . The four ships could carry 900 t ( 890 long tons ; 990 short tons ) of coal , though additional spaces could be used for coal storage , for up to 2 @,@ 680 t ( 2 @,@ 640 long tons ; 2 @,@ 950 short tons ) . At maximum speed , the ships could steam for 600 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ; 690 mi ) ; at 13 kn ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) , the range increased significantly to 2 @,@ 800 nmi ( 5 @,@ 200 km ; 3 @,@ 200 mi ) A further reduction in speed to 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) correspondingly increased the range to 4 @,@ 600 nmi ( 8 @,@ 500 km ; 5 @,@ 300 mi ) . 
 The ships were modified several times in the interwar period . In 1919 , Bretagne was equipped with a heavy tripod mast ; Provence and Lorraine were given tripod masts in the early 1920s . Four of Bretagne 's boilers were converted to oil @-@ firing in 1924 , and half of Provence 's boilers in the rear boiler room were similarly converted in 1927 . Bretagne subsequently had six new oil @-@ fired boilers to replace the rest of the old coal @-@ fired boilers , and her direct drive turbines were replaced with Parsons geared turbines . Provence was similarly modified in 1931 – 1934 . Lorraine 's propulsion system was improved in a similar pattern . In 1935 , " Provence " had her center main battery turret was replaced with an aircraft catapult and a hangar for three aircraft . These were initially Gourdou @-@ Leseurre GL @-@ 819 and Potez 452 seaplanes , though they were replaced with the Loire 130 flying boat . In March – May 1944 , the aircraft installation was removed .

 The ship 's primary battery consisted of ten 340mm / 45 Modèle 1912 guns in five twin gun turrets . The turrets were mounted all on the centerline , with two in a superfiring pair forward of the conning tower , one amidships between the two funnels , and two superfiring aft of the rear superstructure . These guns had a maximum elevation of 12 degrees , with a range of 14 @,@ 500 m ( 47 @,@ 600 ft ) ; this was a result of the CSM 's belief that the decisive battle range would only be 6 @,@ 000 m ( 20 @,@ 000 ft ) and that fleets would not engage at ranges longer than 8 @,@ 000 m ( 26 @,@ 000 ft ) . Lorraine was modified in 1917 to increase the elevation of the guns to 18 degrees , which correspondingly increased the range to 21 @,@ 100 m ( 69 @,@ 200 ft ) . Bretagne and Provence were similarly modified after the end of the war in 1919 . Each gun was supplied with 100 rounds of ammunition , stored in shell rooms located beneath the propellant magazines . The guns were controlled centrally by 4 @.@ 57 m ( 15 @.@ 0 ft ) Barr & Stroud rangefinders ; each turret was also equipped with a 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) independent rangefinder , which were located on top of the turret roofs in an armored hood . 
 Twenty @-@ two Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1910 guns were mounted in casemates along the length of the ship 's hull . They were expected to be used offensively to attack the upper works of enemy battleships , as well as to defend against torpedo boat attacks . The secondary battery fire control consisted of two central directors four rangefinders , which were located abreast of the superfiring turrets , fore and aft . The ships carried seven 47 mm <unk> Hotchkiss quick @-@ firing guns . Two were placed on the conning tower and one was placed on each main battery turret . During World War I , a pair of 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns were added . The ships ' armament were rounded out by four 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . The tubes were submerged in the ships ' hulls . 
 In the interwar period , all three ships had their armament rearranged . In 1919 – 1920 , Bretagne had the four forwardmost of her 138 mm guns removed , along with the 75 mm and two of the 47 mm guns . In their place , four 75 mm mle 1897 guns were installed on the forward superstructure . Twenty @-@ four 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) Hotchkiss machine guns were installed on the forecastle deck in 1927 . The four rearmost 138 mm guns were removed during this refit , along with the 75 mm guns , which were replaced with eight 75 mm mle 1922 anti @-@ aircraft guns . Sixteen 13 @.@ 2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns , in quadruple mounts , were also added . Provence had her four forward 138 mm guns removed in 1919 , and was equipped similarly to Bretagne . In 1931 – 1934 , she received the same eight 75 mm guns as Bretagne did , and in 1940 , three quadruple mounts of 13 @.@ 2 mm guns were fitted . Lorraine followed a similar pattern , though in 1935 , her center main battery turret was removed ; an aircraft catapult was fitted in its place . At this time , four 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) Model <unk> guns were added , along with two of the 13 @.@ 2 mm quadruple mounts . In 1940 , the 100 mm guns were removed to arm the new battleship Richelieu , and eight 75 mm <unk> guns replaced them . In March – May 1944 , fourteen 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) and twenty @-@ five 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns in single mounts were added , and the quadruple 13 @.@ 2 mm guns were removed .

 The <unk> were provided with 4 @.@ 57 @-@ metre ( 15 @.@ 0 ft ) Barr and Stroud rangefinders . Each turret had 2 @-@ metre ( 6 ft 7 in ) rangefinder under an armoured hood at the rear of the turret .

 The ships ' main armored belt was 270 mm ( 11 in ) thick amidships and reduced to 160 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) on either end of the ship .

Horizontal protection consisted of three armored decks ; the main deck was 30 to 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The upper and lower decks were both 40 mm thick . Sloped armor 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) thick connected the main deck to the armored belt .

 All three ships of the class entered service with the French Navy in 1916 . Bretagne and Lorraine were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron , while Provence served as the fleet flagship for the entirety of the First World War . They were deployed to guard the southern end of the Adriatic Sea , based in Argostoli and Corfu , to block a possible sortie by the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet . The three ships largely remained in port , though Provence was repeatedly used to intimidate the government of Greece , which favored Germany during the war . In January 1919 , after the end of the war , Lorraine was sent to Cattaro to guard the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet . She joined her sisters in Toulon in June 1919 ; later that year the ships formed the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet until 1921 . 
 Financial problems forced the French Navy to reduce its battleship force to four active vessels . Lorraine and Provence were reduced to reserve status in 1922 , and the latter went into drydock for a major overhaul . Lorraine returned to service with the Mediterranean Squadron in 1923 . Bretagne remained in service and conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean and along the coast of North Africa during the 1920s and 1930s . In 1934 , Bretagne and Provence were assigned to the 2nd Squadron , based on France 's Atlantic coast . In 1936 , they joined the non @-@ intervention patrols off Spain during the Spanish Civil War . At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , Bretagne and Provence were based in Toulon with the 2nd Squadron , while Lorraine was assigned to the Atlantic Squadron . 
 After undergoing a refit in the early months of the war , Provence conducted anti @-@ raider patrols with Force Y , based in Casablanca . Bretagne was also overhauled early in the war ; in March 1940 she escorted a convoy to Halifax and returned with another convoy loaded with aircraft for the French Air Force . She was then ordered to join Lorraine in Force X , to be based in Alexandria to operate in concert with the British Mediterranean Fleet . Two weeks later , Bretagne was instead ordered to steam at high speed to Bizerte , to join the Force de Raid with Provence . The ships put in at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir and remained there until after the fall of France in June 1940 . To prevent the ships of the French Navy from falling into the hands of the occupying Germans , British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the neutralization of all French warships . Force H was to deliver an ultimatum to the ships based at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir ; on 3 July , the British squadron arrived outside the harbor and demanded that the ships sail with them to Britain or they would be sunk . 
 The British and French negotiated for several hours , and culminated in the British opening fire on the French fleet . In the span of ten minutes , Bretagne was sunk and Provence was badly damaged . Bretagne was hit by at least four 15 in ( 380 mm ) shells from HMS Hood , Resolution and Barham and exploded , killing the vast majority of her crew . Provence was set on fire and sank to the bottom of the harbor , though she was subsequently raised and transferred to Toulon , where she was later scuttled in 1942 to prevent her from being seized by the Germans . They nevertheless salvaged the ship starting in July 1943 . Two of her main guns were emplaced as coastal batteries outside Toulon . Lorraine was disarmed in Alexandria until December 1942 , when she joined the Free French Naval Forces . She served as a training ship for much of 1943 until a major refit at the end of the year to prepare her to participate in Operation Dragoon , the invasion of southern France . She provided gunfire support during the landings before steaming to Britain for a minor refit . She remained in Britain until March 1945 , when she bombarded German @-@ held fortresses in northern France . 
 After the end of the war , Lorraine served as a gunnery training ship in Toulon . She was then used as a barracks ship until February 1953 , when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrapping at the end of the year . She was broken up for scrap outside Toulon the following year . Bretagne remained at the bottom of Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir until she was raised for scrapping in 1952 and broken up . Provence was raised in April 1949 and scrapped .

 Regular elections in Croatia are mandated by the Constitution and legislation enacted by Parliament . The presidency , Parliament , county prefects and assemblies , city and town mayors , and city and municipal councils are all elective offices . Since 1990 , five presidential elections have been held . During the same period , eight parliamentary elections ( including two for the upper house when the parliament was bicameral ) were also held . In addition , there were six nationwide local elections . Croatia has held two elections ( in 2013 and 2014 ) to elect 11 members ( 12 in 2013 ) of the European Parliament following its accession to the EU on 1 July 2013 . 
 The President of Croatia is elected to a five @-@ year term by a direct vote of all citizens in a two @-@ round system , requiring runoff elections if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of votes in the first round . Members of Parliament are elected to a four @-@ year term in ten multi @-@ seat constituencies , with additional members elected in special constituencies reserved for the Croatian diaspora and national minorities . As of November 2011 , legislation provides for the election of 151 members of the unicameral parliament . Out of 25 political parties which won seats in Croatian parliamentary elections held since 1990 , only five have won ten seats or more in any one parliamentary election . Those were the Croatian Democratic Union , the Croatian Peasant Party , the Croatian People 's Party – Liberal Democrats , the Croatian Social Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party of Croatia . The county prefects , city and town mayors are elected to four @-@ year terms by a majority of votes cast within applicable local government units , with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority in the first round of voting . Members of county , city and town councils are elected to four @-@ year terms through proportional representation , with the entire local government unit as a single constituency . 
 Any Croatian citizen over age 18 may be a candidate in presidential , parliamentary or local government elections , provided that a sufficient number of endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand . Croatian elections are relatively well @-@ regulated ; regulations include spending limits , annual donation limits , a limitation on the number of endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage . Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad , monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station . Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates , or an election list with ordinal numbers ( which are circled to indicate a vote ) . All votes are counted by hand . The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints , supported by county , city and town electoral commissions during local elections .

 The Parliament of Croatia ( Croatian : Hrvatski Sabor ) consists of 151 members elected to four @-@ year terms in twelve constituencies . Out of that number , 140 are elected in ten multi @-@ seat territorial constituencies . These are defined on the basis of the existing county borders , with necessary amendments to achieve a uniform number of eligible voters in each constituency ( plus or minus five percent ) . The eleventh constituency is for citizens of Croatia living abroad ; the number of seats held by this constituency was fixed at three for the parliamentary election held in December 2011 . The 2010 constitutional amendments abolished the former scheme , in which the number of MPs elected from the eleventh constituency was proportional to the ratio to the number of ballots cast in the other ten constituencies . In the 2007 general election , this method led to the eleventh constituency electing five MPs . 
 An additional eight members of the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency . It encompasses the entire country ; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia : the Serb minority elects three MPs , the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each , the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP , and all other minorities elect the final two MPs . The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry , which is provided by the registrar 's office that maintains Croatia 's vital records . Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth , but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar 's office at least 14 days ahead of elections ( not at the polling station ) . The voter 's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown . During elections , voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list ; a voter of unknown or non @-@ declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list ; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list ( the same as someone who has declared themselves a Croat ) . 
 The standard d 'Hondt formula is applied to the vote , with a five @-@ percent election threshold . Since 2015 , the parliamentary elections have an element of preferential voting exists by letting voters choose not only for a list of candidates , but also a single member of the same list . If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10 % , they are elected as if it was an open list system . The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota . The last two parliamentary elections elected a total of 151 MPs . An election silence is enforced on the day before and the day of the elections , ending at 7 : 00 pm when the polling stations close and the exit polls are published . Although political parties fund their campaigns using donations or their own assets , the government reimburses them for each parliamentary seat won . For instance , each seat won in the 2011 parliamentary election brought a party 180 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 24 @,@ 300 euros ) . Smaller sums were paid to parties or candidates failing to win any parliamentary seats , provided that they received more than five percent of the votes cast in a constituency .

 As the 8th Assembly of Parliament first constituted on 28 December 2015 the next elections for the Croatian Parliament were originally ment to be held no later than 26 February 2020 . However , after the fall of Tihomir Orešković 's government on 16 June 2016 , a proposal for the dissolution of parliament put forward by the parliamentary opposition gained the support of a majority of the Members of Parliament . A vote on the issue was held on 20 June 2016 , being approved by a majority of 137 votes and officially took effect on 15 July 2016 , while the early election to elect the members of the 9th Assembly will be held on 11 September 2016

 Since 1990 , nine parliamentary elections have been held in Croatia . These have included the 1990 elections for a <unk> parliament , three elections of the Chamber of Deputies during the bicameral parliament 's existence , three elections of the unicameral Parliament and two elections of the Chamber of Counties — the upper house of the bicameral parliament . 
 The elections held in 1990 were the first multi @-@ party elections after 45 years of Communist rule ; candidates vied for all 80 seats in the Social @-@ Political Council of Croatia , all 116 seats in the Municipalities Council of Croatia and all 160 seats in the Associated Labour Council of Croatia ( since Parliament had three chambers at the time ) . The first round of the election saw a turnout of 85 @.@ 5 percent , and the runoff @-@ election turnout was 74 @.@ 8 percent . The Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) won 205 seats , and the Social Democratic Party of Croatia won 107 . 
 = = = = Previous Chamber of Deputies and unicameral Sabor elections = = = = 
 Eight parliamentary elections have been held since for the Chamber of Deputies ( Croatian : <unk> dom ) or the unicameral parliament since then — in 1992 , 1995 , 2000 , 2003 , 2007 , 2011 , 2015 and 2016 . Beginning with the 1992 elections , the number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies ( and , later , in the unicameral parliament ) was significantly changed — ranging from 127 in 1995 to 153 in 2007 and 151 in 2011 . In the Croatian parliamentary elections held since 1992 , when the number of seats in parliament was limited below 160 , only five parties have won ten seats or more in any single election : the HDZ , the Croatian Peasant Party ( HSS ) , the Croatian People 's Party – Liberal Democrats ( HNS ) , the Croatian Social Liberal Party ( HSLS ) and the SDP . 
 Several other political parties ( besides the HDZ , HSS , HNS , HSLS and SDP ) have won parliamentary seats since the 1990 election . Those are ( in alphabetical order ) : the Alliance of Primorje @-@ Gorski Kotar ( previously known as the Rijeka Democratic Alliance ) , the Croatian Christian Democratic Union , the Croatian Citizen Party , the Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja , the Croatian Democratic Peasant Party , the Croatian Independent Democrats , the Croatian Party of Pensioners , the Croatian Party of Rights , the Croatian Party of Rights dr . Ante Starčević , Dalmatian Action , the Democratic Centre , the Istrian Democratic Assembly , the Liberal Party , the Party of Liberal Democrats , the Serb Democratic Party , the Slavonia @-@ Baranja Croatian Party and the Social Democratic Action of Croatia . The following parties have won the special seats reserved for national minority representatives ( also in alphabetical order ) : the Bosnian Democratic Party of Croatia , the Democratic Union of Hungarians of Croatia , the German People 's Union – National Association of Danube Swabians in Croatia , the Independent Democratic Serb Party , the Party of Democratic Action of Croatia and the Serb People 's Party . In addition , numerous independents have won seats through party lists , and Ivan <unk> 's nonpartisan list won seats as a territorial election list . Since the parliamentary seats won belong to individuals , not parties , there have been instances where members have become independent or switched to another political party . 
 = = = = Chamber of Counties elections = = = = 
 Under the Constitution of Croatia adopted in 1990 , the Croatian Parliament became bicameral . The Chamber of Deputies had been elected a few months earlier , and its members enacted legislation creating a new territorial organisation of Croatia . This included 21 counties that were to be represented by the new Chamber of Counties ( Croatian : <unk> dom ) . The first election of members to the chamber was held on 7 February 1993 , with each county acting as a multi @-@ seat constituency ; three MPs were elected in each county on the basis of proportional representation . In addition , the President of Croatia appointed up to 5 more members of the Chamber of the Counties to complete its 68 @-@ strong membership . The second election for the Chamber of Counties was held on 13 April 1997 . The Chamber of Deputies was abolished by a constitutional amendment in 2001 . 
 = = Presidential elections = = 
 The President of Croatia ( officially the President of the Republic , Croatian : Predsjednik Republike ) is elected to a five @-@ year term by a direct vote of all citizens , with a majority vote required to win . A runoff election is held if no candidate secures a majority in the first round . The presidential elections are regulated by the constitution and dedicated legislation ; however , the latter only defines technical details , appeals and similar issues . Any citizen of Croatia , 18 or older , may be a candidate in a presidential election if the candidate is endorsed by 10 @,@ 000 voters . The endorsements are required in the form of a list containing name , address , personal identification number and voter signature . The presidential elections are regulated by an act of parliament . Election silence is in force on the day of the elections and the previous day , ending at 7 in the evening as polling stations close ; exit polls may be published after that time . Unless the presidential term is cut short by death , resignation or removal from office , resulting in an early election , the elections for President of the Republic are scheduled to take place every 5 years , with the incumbent having a possibility of re @-@ election . The president is currently term limited to two 5 @-@ year terms .

 = = = Next presidential election = = = 
 The next presidential election in Croatia is due to be held no more than 60 and no less than 30 days before the expiry of the current president 's term , as stated in the Constitution of Croatia . If the current president serves her full term , which began on 19 February 2015 and lasts for 5 years , the election must be held on a date between 21 December 2019 and 20 January 2020 . 
 The current , 4th president of the Republic Kolinda Grabar @-@ Kitarović , can run for reelection to a second term . Another eligible candidate is former president Ivo Josipović , who lost the 2015 election after serving one term and is therefore also eligible to run for reelection . 
 Possible candidates : 
 <unk> Grabar @-@ Kitarović - incumbent president ( <unk> ) 
 <unk> Josipović - 3rd president of Croatia ( 2010 @-@ 2015 ) 
 = = = Previous presidential elections = = = 
 Presidential elections were held in Croatia for the first time on 2 August 1992 , concurrently with the 1992 parliamentary elections . Voter turnout was 74 @.@ 9 percent . The result was a victory for Franjo Tuđman of the HDZ , who received 57 @.@ 8 percent of the vote in the first round of the election ( ahead of seven other candidates ) . Dražen Budiša , the HSLS candidate and runner @-@ up in the election , received 22 @.@ 3 percent of the vote . The second presidential election in modern Croatia was held on 15 June 1997 . The incumbent , Franjo Tuđman , ran opposed by Zdravko Tomac ( candidate of the SDP ) and Vlado Gotovac ( nominated by the HSLS ) . Tomac and Gotovac received 21 @.@ 0 and 17 @.@ 6 percent of votes , respectively , in the first round of voting and Tuđman secured another term . The third presidential elections were held on 24 January 2000 to fill the office of President , after incumbent Franjo Tuđman died on 10 December 1999 . The first round of voting saw Stjepan Mesić ( candidate of the Croatian People 's Party , or HNS ) in front with 41 @.@ 3 percent of the vote , followed by Dražen Budiša of the HSLS with 27 @.@ 8 percent and Mate Granić ( nominated by the HDZ ) receiving 22 @.@ 6 percent . The runoff election ( the first in a modern Croatian presidential election ) was held on 7 February ; Mesić won , picking up 56 @.@ 9 percent of the vote . Voter turnout was 63 @.@ 0 percent in the first round , and 60 @.@ 9 percent in the runoff . The first round of the fourth presidential election was held on 2 January 2005 . No candidate secured a first @-@ round victory ; however , incumbent Mesić enjoyed a substantial lead over the other candidates . Mesić received 48 @.@ 9 percent of the vote ; the second- and third @-@ ranked candidates ( Jadranka Kosor of the HDZ and Boris <unk> , an independent ) managed only 20 @.@ 3 and 17 @.@ 8 percent , respectively , of voter support . Ultimately , Mesić won reelection by receiving 65 @.@ 9 percent of votes in the runoff held on 16 January . The most recent Croatian presidential election was held on 27 December 2009 with Ivo Josipović ( SDP ) picking up 32 @.@ 4 percent of the vote , followed by Milan Bandić ( independent ) , Andrija Hebrang ( HDZ ) and <unk> <unk> ( independent ) receiving 14 @.@ 8 , 12 @.@ 0 and 11 @.@ 3 percent of the vote respectively . The second round of voting was held on 10 January 2010 , when Josipović defeated Bandić with 60 @.@ 3 percent of the vote . 
 = = Local elections = = 
 Croatia 's county prefects , city and town mayors are elected to four @-@ year terms by a majority of votes cast within applicable local government units , with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority in the first round of voting . Members of county , city and municipal councils are elected to four @-@ year terms through proportional representation , with the entire local government unit as a single constituency . The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves , based on applicable legislation . Electoral committees are tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council ( as required by the constitution ) , adding further members to the council ( who belong to the appropriate minorities ) by selecting them from unelected @-@ candidate lists . Election silence , as in all other elections in Croatia , is enforced on the day of the elections and the previous day , ending at 7 : 00 pm when the polling stations close and exit polls may be announced . 
 Of the six nationwide local elections held in Croatia since 1990 , the most recent were the 2009 local elections to elect county prefects and councils , city and town councils and mayors . In these elections , HDZ @-@ led coalitions won a majority or plurality in 15 county @-@ council and 13 county @-@ prefect elections . SDP @-@ led coalitions won a majority or plurality in five county councils ( including the city of Zagreb council ) , and the single remaining county council election was won by an IDS @-@ SDP coalition . The SDP won four county prefect elections and the city of Zagreb mayoral election , the HSS won three county @-@ prefect elections , and the HNS and HDSSB won one county @-@ prefect election each . 
 = = European Parliament elections = = 
 Croatia first elected 12 members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) in a by @-@ election held after its accession to the EU in 2013 . Thereafter , its number of members in the European Parliament was reduced to 11 and the country elected them as part of the regular election in 2014 . The elections are regulated by special legislation enacted by the Sabor . Provisions of the legislation are very similar to the parliamentary @-@ election legislation , with the main difference being that the 11 members of the European Parliament are elected in a single constituency encompassing all of Croatia , instead of multiple constituencies used in the parliamentary elections . 
 = = Referendums = = 
 A referendum in Croatia can be called by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within the purview of parliament , or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence , unity and existence of the republic . Since the constitution was amended in 2001 , parliament is obligated by the constitution to call for a referendum if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected . The signatures , by law , must be collected within a 15 @-@ day period . Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum . 
 There have been three referendums in modern Croatia : Croatian independence referendum , Croatian European Union membership referendum and Marriage definition referendum , and in all three majority voted in favor . There have been four other public initiatives to collect the support of 10 percent of voters for a referendum , none of which were successful : concerning Croatian cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , concerning accession of Croatia to NATO in 2008 , concerning Arbitration Agreement on Croatian @-@ Slovenian border issues in 2009 , and concerning Labour Act in 2010 . 
 = = Political campaigns = = 
 Any Croatian citizen aged 18 or over may become a candidate in presidential , parliamentary or local elections . In order to become an official candidate , 10 @,@ 000 signatures from Croatian citizens aged 18 or over must be collected and submitted to the State Electoral Commission . This must be done within 12 days following the publication of the decision to hold elections in Narodne <unk> , the official gazette of the Republic of Croatia . The endorsements are made in a list comprising name , address and personal identification number ( PIN ) of each of the citizens supporting a particular candidate . Each citizen may only endorse a single candidate . The election commission verifies the endorsement lists , publishes the candidate list in all daily newspapers in Croatia ( and on Croatian Radiotelevision ) and delivers it to the Croatian diplomatic missions for publication . 
 In parliamentary elections , 14 @-@ member election lists may be submitted to the State Electoral Commission for any number of constituencies in Croatia . A 14 @-@ member list of candidates may also be submitted for the Croatian diaspora constituency , while a two @-@ member list can be submitted for the ethnic @-@ minority representatives . In each case , 500 endorsements are required for an election list to become valid . The lists may be supported by one or more political parties , or by a group of voters as an independent list . No one may be a candidate on two or more lists simultaneously . 
 The same procedure applies to local elections , except that council @-@ election lists require 100 , 150 and 500 endorsements for town , city and county @-@ council lists respectively . The city of Zagreb council is treated as a county council under election law . The number of voter signatures on mayoral and county prefect candidate nominations ranges between 50 ( for mayoral elections in towns of up to 1 @,@ 000 residents ) , 100 ( for other town mayoral candidates ) , 500 ( for mayoral elections in cities of up to 35 @,@ 000 residents ) , 1 @,@ 000 ( in cities with populations between 35 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 ) and 2 @,@ 000 endorsements for cities of 100 @,@ 000 residents or more ( with the exception of Zagreb ) . County prefect election candidates require 2 @,@ 500 endorsements , and candidates running for mayor of Zagreb need 5 @,@ 000 voter endorsements for their nominations to become valid . 
 Candidates running for European Parliament seats need not be Croatian citizens and may hold citizenship in any member state of the European Union , while having a permanent ( or temporary ) residence in Croatia . Their nominations are valid if endorsed by 5 @,@ 000 Croatian voters . 
 = = = Funding = = = 
 The funding of political parties , independent politicians and election campaigns is relatively highly regulated in comparison with developed western democracies . Applicable legislation encompasses cash receipts , provision of free services ( except the labour of volunteers ) , and products and other forms of support ( including membership fees ) . The legislation also stipulates that the government budget provides funding for political parties and non @-@ partisan political representatives in the amount of 0 @.@ 05 percent of the previous year 's budget expenditures . Additional funds are appropriated in local government budgets . The funds are distributed to elected members of parliament and councils , and the political parties with which they are affiliated receive 10 percent of the funds . Each election candidate ( or slate ) must have a dedicated bank account to handle election @-@ campaign donations , other related funding , and all campaign @-@ related expenditures . The maximum donation to a single party , candidate or slate made in a year is also regulated . In cases of individuals it is set at 30 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 4 @,@ 050 euro ) , regardless of purpose . Companies and other legal persons are limited to the same amount in local elections ; 100 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 13 @,@ 500 euro ) for parliamentary or European Parliament elections and 200 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 27 @,@ 000 euro ) for presidential elections to any one candidate , party or slate ( whichever is applicable ) . Total campaign expenditures are also limited to 8 million kuna ( c . 1 @.@ 08 million euro ) per candidate in presidential elections , 1 @.@ 5 million kuna ( c . 202 @,@ 000 euro ) per candidate ( or slate ) in European Parliament or parliamentary elections , 500 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 67 @,@ 600 euro ) per candidate in Zagreb mayoral elections and 400 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 54 @,@ 000 euro ) per candidate in county @-@ prefect or mayoral elections in cities of 35 @,@ 000 residents or larger and in county seats . Mayoral election @-@ campaign expenditures in other cities and towns is also limited , depending on the local government 's population : 250 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 33 @,@ 800 euro ) if the population exceeds 10 @,@ 000 residents , 100 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 13 @,@ 500 euro ) in population units of 3 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 and up to 50 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 6 @,@ 750 euro ) in smaller self @-@ governing units . All candidates and parties ( or slates ) are legally required to publish financial reports detailing their funding , which are audited by the State Electoral Commission and the State Audit Office . They are also legally required to turn over all receipts exceeding the legal limits in favour of the central government budget within eight days . 
 In the 2007 parliamentary elections , the leading political parties reported campaign spending as follows : the Croatian Democratic Union spent 19 @.@ 5 million kuna ( c . 2 @.@ 6 million euro ) , the Social Democratic Party of Croatia spent 15 @.@ 8 million kuna ( c . 2 @.@ 1 million euro ) , the Croatian People 's Party – Liberal Democrats spent 9 million kuna ( c . 1 @.@ 2 million euro ) , while the Croatian Peasant Party led coalition reported spending 8 million kuna ( c . 1 @.@ 08 million euro ) and the Croatian Party of Rights spent a similar amount . 
 All presidential election candidates receiving at least 10 percent of the vote are awarded an equal sum as election @-@ campaign reimbursement . The amount is decided by the government at least 30 days before the election . This amount was set at 250 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 33 @,@ 800 euro ) for the 2009 – 2010 presidential election , representing a 50 @-@ percent decrease from the sum determined for the previous presidential election ( when the reimbursement sum was set at half @-@ a @-@ million kuna ) . Similarly , the government also reimburses the political parties and slates for each parliamentary seat won . For the 2011 parliamentary election , each seat will be given 180 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 24 @,@ 300 euro ) . A sum of 30 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 4 @,@ 050 euro ) will be paid to parties or candidates failing to win any parliamentary seats if they receive more than five percent of votes in a constituency . In addition , national @-@ minority @-@ representative candidates running on the minority ballot failing to win parliamentary seats ( but still winning at least 15 percent of votes in their constituency ) will receive 27 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 3 @,@ 650 euro ) if the minority comprises less than 1 @.@ 5 percent of the total population of Croatia . All European Parliament election candidates and county @-@ prefect and mayoral @-@ election candidates receiving at least 10 percent of the vote are also entitled to receive reimbursement of costs in an amount determined by the government ahead of each election . 
 = = = Media coverage and promotion = = = 
 Legislation requires that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates ( or slates ) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms in the media ( in addition to paid advertising ) . In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media , including nationwide television broadcasters . During this period the broadcasters , which included Croatian Radiotelevision ( HTV ) , RTL Televizija ( RTL ) and Nova TV , aired 27 @.@ 8 hours of news on 22 different programs with 1 @,@ 196 news reports . This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections . Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly @-@ matched coverage of the combined ruling party ( HDZ ) and official government statements on one side , and the main opposition party ( SDP ) on the other ; each received an average of a 37 @.@ 5 @-@ percent share of coverage and a 33 @-@ percent share of interviews aired . HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government , while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP . However , the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios . Other political parties received considerably less coverage . HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage , HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five @-@ percent coverage . The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates . 
 Paid promotion largely followed this pattern , as the HDZ and the SDP were two dominant parties in that field as well . The Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) noted in its report that the largest parties reported their advertising spending below their actual value , and the largest proportion of expenditure was for television ads . Election silence is in force on the day of the elections and the previous day , ending at 7 in the evening as polling stations close and exit polls may be published after that time . 
 = = Voting and appeals = = 
 Polling stations are set up in public buildings throughout the country ; voters may only vote at their assigned polling station ( according to their permanent residence ) , but voters deployed abroad in the armed forces , voters on Croatian @-@ flagged ships and imprisoned voters are allowed to vote elsewhere . Other voters residing in Croatia , but traveling abroad on election day may vote at Croatian diplomatic missions . Polling stations are open from 7 : 00 am until 7 : 00 pm , but all voters present at the polling stations at closing time are allowed to vote . Polling stations may be closed early if all registered voters have voted . Presidential election ballots contain a list of candidates verified by the State Electoral Commission , in alphabetical order . This entails the name and PIN of each candidate , and the names of political parties endorsing the candidate ( or a note that the candidate is running as an independent . The names are preceded by ordinal numbers . Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate and the name of the person heading the list , in addition to candidates , who is not necessarily a candidate on the particular list , but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the list — usually head of the party of coalition at the national level . The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number . Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate . Ballots marked otherwise ( but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast ) are also considered valid . Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled ( or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated ) are invalid . Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission . 
 = = = Voter registry = = = 
 The register of voters in Croatia is defined by law . The register lists all citizens of Croatia aged 18 and over , except those who have been stripped of their voting rights by a court decision . The register is organized according to legal residence ( <unk> ) and maintained by government offices in counties and the city of Zagreb . Each citizen of Croatia may request a review of the register and amendments to personal information ( supported by applicable documents ) . The voter register is used to confirm the right to vote at the polling station and to verify voter endorsements of candidates and election lists submitted to the electoral commissions . Voters who expect to travel in Croatia or abroad on election day may require inclusion in a provisional list which allows them to vote at a polling station other than that assigned to them by residence . Failing that , a voter may obtain an excerpt from the registry on election day to be allowed to vote . 
 A pattern of irregularities has been discovered concerning the updating of the list when citizens of Croatia turn 18 or die . In 2005 , it was estimated that the register contained a large number of irregularities and erroneous entries . Since then , public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through <unk> and advertising campaigns ; according to GONG — a NGO specializing in election monitoring — although the register was improved , there is room for further improvement . The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should not be there , leading to claims that up to a half @-@ million voters in the registry should not be included . 
 = = = Complaints and appeals = = = 
 Political parties , candidates and voters who have endorsed a particular candidate ( or state ) in presidential , parliamentary or European Parliament elections may file complaints with the State Electoral Commission regarding irregularities in the election process within 48 hours of a disputed activity . In the European Parliament elections , voter complaints are required to be endorsed by at least 100 voters ( or five percent of the voters ) . If the commission finds the complaint valid , it will order the part of the election process directly affected by the disputed activity to be repeated ( possibly postponing the election date if there is insufficient time left ) . The commission must provide its decision within 48 hours after the complaint is submitted . The decision may be appealed before the Constitutional Court of Croatia within 48 hours of its receipt and once petitioned , the court must return a ruling within 48 hours . In local council elections , complaints are processed by county , city or town electoral commissions ( as appropriate ) . In mayoral elections , complaints are filed with the county electoral commission . This does not apply to Zagreb mayoral elections , where complaints are submitted to the State Electoral Commission ( the case also in county prefect elections ) . The time allowances and appeals procedure are the same as for presidential and parliamentary elections . 
 = = = Monitoring = = = 
 Elections are governed by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards . Members of those bodies are required to have a university degree in law , and they may not be members of any political party . The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation , appoints lower @-@ ranking election @-@ commission and board members , issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work . The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists , supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results . All members of election boards ( or their legal deputies ) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while the polling station is open . The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the turnout . The turnout number is later checked against number of votes cast ; if the number of votes exceeds the turnout , the election at that polling station must be repeated . Votes are tallied by hand , and that information is forwarded ( along with all other records kept at the polling station ) to the State Electoral Commission . 
 Further monitoring is performed by non @-@ governmental organizations specializing in election monitoring , such as GONG . There are also other monitoring organisations headquartered in Croatia and abroad ; the OSCE set up a limited monitoring mission to observe the 2009 – 2010 presidential elections . The last parliamentary election ( held in 2007 ) was monitored by 8 @,@ 540 observers fielded by a number of organisations and political parties . 
 = Lorne ( electoral district ) = 
 Lorne was an electoral district that existed in the District of Saskatchewan , Northwest Territories from 1880 until 1888 . The district was one of the first three created by Royal Proclamation in 1880 . Of the first three electoral districts proclaimed , it was the only one to actually have an election held in it . 
 Under the Northwest Territories Act 1880 the district was mandated at its inception to return a single member to the Northwest Territories Legislature under the First Past the Post electoral system . The district was named in the honour of former Governor General , the Marquess of Lorne . Lorne would tour the through the Northwest Territories just after the electoral district was created in 1881 . 
 The electoral district ceased to exist at the drop of the writ for the 1888 Northwest Territories general election . This was due to a population boom in the area caused by an influx of settlers . The electoral district was redistributed and split between the electoral districts of Batoche and the Prince Albert electoral district . During the nine years the district existed , it returned three members through three elections who served roughly three @-@ year terms . 
 = = Overview = = 
 The electoral district was one of three royally proclaimed by Lieutenant @-@ Governor David Laird on November 13 , 1880 The other two electoral districts were Salisbury , named after the Marquess of Salisbury and Kimberley name after the Lord of Kimberley . Kimberley 's contribution to the Northwest Territories was transferring the Canadian Arctic Archipelago to Canada on September 1 , 1880 . 
 The electoral district was created with the provision to cover an area of 1 @,@ 000 square miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km2 ) and have a population of 1000 electors . The major population centres in the electoral district at the time of creation were Prince Albert , and Fort Carlton . The land around the district boomed due to a high rate of settlement in that period . The cause of this was due to the possibility of the Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway line being built through the area . 
 The Northwest Territories political system used at this time was run by an early form of consensus government . Candidates stood for election independent of the political parties that exist in other provinces and territories and the federal level within Canada . The government had not yet developed to the point of being a Responsible government as the majority of members were appointed and not elected . The district was served by three representatives during its eight @-@ year history .

 = = = 1881 election = = = 
 The 1881 by @-@ election held on March 23 , 1881 was a pivotal milestone towards Responsible Government being attained in the Northwest Territories . The election marked the first time the provision of the North @-@ West Territories Act 1880 that allowed for an electoral district to be proclaimed if an area the size of 1 @,@ 000 square miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km2 ) had 1000 residents had been activated . 
 The election was conducted by voice vote , a qualified elector would tell the returning officer at a polling station who he was going to vote for and the results would be tallied . Under the terms of the Act eligible electors were males who had reached the age of majority , which was 21 years of age at that time . The act specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens or <unk> Indians . Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped . 
 The election commenced when Lieutenant @-@ Governor David Laird dropped the writ on 1881 . The election was contested by two candidates , Lawrence Clarke who was a fur trader and Chief Factor of the District of Saskatchewan for the Hudson 's Bay Company . Clarke 's opponent was Henry Stewart Moore a local French speaking businessman from Prince Albert who had been operating a flour mill since 1875 . 
 Clarke held a big advantage in the campaign as he was supported by the Métis who had been looking for someone to locally represent them in the Legislature since the territory was formed in 1870 . Clarke had also built his popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader . On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory . He defeated Moore winning nearly 64 % of popular vote . His resounding win would make him the first elected member to sit on the Northwest Territories council . 
 = = = 1883 election = = = 
 Nearing the end of his term in office Clarke decided not to run for re @-@ election in 1883 . He was losing too much support due to his ties with the Hudson 's Bay Company . The electorate suspected him of working under the influence of his office to locate important government offices on the land owned by the company . Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election , Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter . 
 Andrew Porter was famous for being the first registered private practicing medical doctor in the history of the Northwest Territories . He originally settled in Prince Albert in 1878 . MacDowall campaigned by appealing to the concerns of the Métis who comprised the largest demographic in the district . He promised them that he would go to the Federal Government with their demands for better representation . He also helped win support by donating $ 1 @,@ 100 out of pocket towards the construction of a new church for the community of Batoche . MacDowall 's campaign efforts and donation proved to be very popular . 
 MacDowall 's appeal for representation translated into a landslide victory on election day . On June 5 , 1883 he defeated Andrew Porter capturing nearly 70 % of the popular vote . His win was the largest majority of the three elections held in the electoral district . 
 The official results for the race showed MacDowall won big in most of the polls , winning four out of five . Porter 's support was concentrated in The Ridge where he won his only poll . MacDowall swept the south end of the district winning a shut out in the Métis communities of Duck Lake and St. Laurent de Grandin . Along with the shut out he held strong support in the rest of the riding , with his biggest single vote tally of votes coming form within the town of Prince Albert . 
 = = = 1885 election = = = 
 The 1885 election in this district was held on September 17 , 1885 as part of the 1885 Northwest Territories election . This was the first major election held in the Northwest Territories . The election grouped together a number of old districts that had been coming up for renewal on their three @-@ year cycle and by @-@ elections in new districts that were created by a population boom of settlers moving into the territory . 
 Incumbent MacDowall , had played a major role in subduing the North @-@ West Rebellion at the end of his term in office . He would not run for re @-@ election instead choosing to campaign for a seat in the Canadian House of Commons . Dr. Porter attempted to win a seat by running for office a second time . Porter was challenged by Captain Owen E. Hughes , a business man from Duck Lake . Hughes had been the captain of the Prince Albert militia unit that was disbanded by the Federal Government prior to the start of the North @-@ West Resistance . Many of his former unit , including his lieutenant , Gabriel Dumont , were among the Metis who drove the loyalist forces back at the Battle of Fish Creek . 
 On election day , despite increasing his popular share of the vote over the 1883 election even with lower turnout , Porter was defeated by Hughes . The race was very tight and hotly contested nearly ending in a tie vote . Hughes captured the electoral district by a margin of eight votes winning just over 51 % of the popular vote . 
 = SENSOR @-@ Pesticides = 
 Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks ( SENSOR ) <unk> is a U.S. state @-@ based surveillance program that monitors pesticide @-@ related illness and injury . It is administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) , twelve state health agencies participate . NIOSH provides technical support to all participating states . It also provides funding to some states , in conjunction with the US Environmental Protection Agency ( US EPA ) . 
 Pesticide @-@ related illness is a significant occupational health issue , but it is believed to be underreported . Because of this , NIOSH proposed the SENSOR program to track pesticide poisonings . Because workers in many industries are at risk for pesticide exposure , and public concern exists regarding the use of and exposure to pesticides , government and regulatory authorities experience pressure to monitor health effects associated with them . SENSOR @-@ Pesticides state partners collect case data from several different sources using a standard case definition and set of variables . This information is then forwarded to the program headquarters at NIOSH where it is compiled and put into a national database . 
 Researchers and government officials from the SENSOR @-@ Pesticides program have published research articles that highlight findings from the data and their implications for environmental and occupational pesticide issues . These issues include eradication of invasive species , pesticide poisoning in schools , birth defects , and residential use of total release foggers , or " bug bombs , " which are devices that release an insecticide mist . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although it is a significant occupational health issue , work @-@ related pesticide poisoning is believed to be underreported . Before the SENSOR program began , state programs that collected reports of occupational diseases did not usually conduct interventions . While over 25 states required reporting of pesticide @-@ related illness , most of them could not compile useful information on incidence or prevalence . In response to these challenges , NIOSH proposed the SENSOR program as a model to track certain occupational conditions , including pesticides . 
 Pesticide poisoning is an important occupational health issue because pesticides are used in a large number of industries , which puts many different categories of workers at risk . From 1995 to 2001 , use in agriculture accounted for at least 70 % of conventional pesticide use in the U.S. , and the US EPA estimates that the agricultural sector has had a similar market share of pesticides since 1979 . Pesticides are particularly useful in agriculture because they increase crop yields and reduce the need for manual labor . However , this extensive use puts agricultural workers at increased risk for pesticide illnesses . Workers in other industries are at risk for exposure as well . For example , commercial availability of pesticides in stores puts retail workers at risk for exposure and illness when they handle pesticide products . The ubiquity of pesticides puts emergency responders such as fire @-@ fighters and police officers at risk , because they are often the first responders to emergency events and may be unaware of the presence of a poisoning hazard . The process of aircraft <unk> , in which pesticides are used on inbound international flights for insect and disease control , can also make flight attendants sick . 
 The widespread use of pesticides , their release into the environment , and the potential for adverse public health effects due to exposure may raise public concern . Some feel that regulatory authorities have an ethical obligation to track the health effects of such chemicals . In the Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology , Calvert et al. write " [ b ] ecause society allows pesticides to be disseminated into the environment , society also incurs the obligation to track the health effects of pesticides . " Jay Vroom , president of CropLife America , said in a press release that " ... our industry has a moral and ethical obligation ... to know how these products impact humans . " Surveillance of pesticide @-@ related injuries and illnesses is recommended by the American Medical Association , the Council of State and Territorial <unk> ( <unk> ) , the Pew Environmental Health Commission , and the Government Accountability Office . 
 = = History = = 
 Beginning in 1987 , NIOSH supported the implementation of the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks ( SENSOR ) program in ten state health departments . The objectives of the program were to help state health departments develop and refine reporting systems for certain occupational disorders so that they could conduct and evaluate interventions and prevention efforts . The disorders covered by SENSOR included silicosis , occupational asthma , carpal tunnel syndrome , lead poisoning , and pesticide poisoning . While each participating state health department had previously done surveillance or interventions for some of these occupational illnesses , SENSOR helped the states to develop and refine their reporting systems and programs . 
 The original SENSOR @-@ Pesticides model was based on physician reporting . Each state contacted a select group of sentinel health care professionals on a regular basis to collect information . However , this system was labor @-@ intensive and did not yield many cases . Because different states used different methods for collecting information , their data could not be compiled or compared to analyze for trends . In response , NIOSH , along with other federal agencies ( US EPA , National Center for Environmental Health ) , non @-@ federal agencies ( <unk> , Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics ) , and state health departments , developed a standard case definition and a set of standardized variables . As of 2013 , SENSOR @-@ Pesticides had 12 participating states contributing occupational pesticide @-@ related injury and illness data : California , Florida , Iowa , Louisiana , Michigan , New York , North Carolina , and Washington received federal funding to support surveillance activities , while Nebraska , New Mexico , Oregon , and Texas were unfunded SENSOR @-@ Pesticides program partners . 
 = = Case definition = = 
 A case of pesticide @-@ related illness or injury is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms that are temporally related to a pesticide exposure . Cases are classified as occupational if exposure occurs at work , unless the case was a suicide or an attempted suicide . 
 Cases are reportable when : 
 there is documentation of new adverse health effects temporally related to a documented pesticide exposure AND 
 there is consistent evidence of a causal relationship between the pesticide and the health effects based on the known toxicology of the pesticide OR 
 there is not enough information to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the exposure and the health effects . 
 State public health officials rate each case as definite , probable , possible or suspicious . Illness severity is assigned as low , moderate , severe , or fatal . 
 = = Data collection = = 
 All states in the program require physicians to report pesticide @-@ related injuries and illnesses ; however , most states collect the majority of their data from workers ’ compensation claims , poison control centers , and state agencies with jurisdiction over pesticide use , such as state departments of agriculture . When they receive a report , health department officials review the information to determine whether it was pesticide related . If it was , they request medical records and try to interview the patient ( or a proxy ) and anyone else involved in the incident ( e.g. supervisors , applicators , and witnesses ) . The data is compiled each year and put into a national database . 
 In addition to identifying , classifying , and tabulating pesticide poisoning cases , the states periodically investigate pesticide @-@ related events and develop interventions aimed at particular industries or pesticide hazards . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Federal and state @-@ level scientists and researchers with SENSOR @-@ Pesticides have published articles on pesticide exposure events and trends using program data . These articles include MMWR publications and articles in peer @-@ reviewed journals on exposures such as acute pesticide @-@ related illness in youth , agricultural workers , retail workers , migrant farm workers , and flight attendants . Several articles have attracted media attention and motivated legislative or other governmental action . 
 = = = Florida Medfly Eradication Program = = = 
 In response to a Mediterranean fruit fly ( also known as “ Medfly ” ) outbreak , officials from the Florida Department of Agriculture sprayed pesticides ( primarily malathion ) and bait over five counties during the spring and summer of 1998 . Scientists from the University of Florida ’ s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences stated that malathion was being sprayed in a manner that did not pose a significant risk to public health . During the eradication effort , the Florida Department of Health investigated 230 cases of illness that were attributed to the pesticide . Officials from the Florida Department of Health and the SENSOR @-@ Pesticides program published an article in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ) that described these case reports and recommended alternative methods for Medfly control , including exclusion activities at ports of entry to prevent importation , more rapid detection through increased sentinel trapping densities , and the release of sterile male flies to interrupt the reproductive cycle . The United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) incorporated these suggestions into their 2001 Environmental Impact Statement on the Fruit Fly Cooperative Control Program . These impact statements guide the USDA 's development of insect control strategies and decisions . 
 = = = Pesticides in schools = = = 
 Researchers from the SENSOR @-@ Pesticides program published an article in 2005 in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) on pesticide poisoning in schools . The article , which included data collected by SENSOR , described illnesses in students and school employees associated with pesticide exposures . The study found that rates of pesticide @-@ related illnesses in children rose significantly from 1998 to 2002 and called for a reduction in pesticide use to prevent pesticide @-@ related illness on or near school grounds . The article generated media coverage and drew attention to pesticide safety in schools and to safer alternatives to pesticides through integrated pest management ( IPM ) . " [ T ] he study does provide evidence that using pesticides at schools is not innocuous and that there are better ways to use pesticides , " said study co @-@ author Dr. Geoffrey Calvert . Officials in organizations supporting the pesticide industry , such as CropLife America and RISE ( Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment , a trade association representing pesticide manufacturers and suppliers ) , reacted strongly to the report , calling it “ alarmist ” and “ incomplete ” in its health reporting . CropLife America president Jay Vroom claimed that the report was “ written without context about the proper use of pesticides in schools and [ did ] not mention the positive public health protections they provide " and stated that pesticide use in schools is " well regulated " and can be managed so that the risk is low . RISE president Allen James faulted the article for relying on unverified reports and said that evidence suggested that such incidents were extremely rare . The increased awareness of pesticide use in schools influenced parents and other stakeholders in numerous states to call for the adoption of integrated pest management programs . According to the National Pest Management Association , three more states passed IPM rules or laws between October 2005 and October 2008 . 
 = = = Birth defects in Florida and North Carolina = = = 
 In February 2005 , three infants were born with birth defects to migrant farmworkers within eight weeks of each other in Collier County , Florida . Because one of the mothers had worked in North Carolina and the other two worked in Florida , neither state 's health department attributed the cluster to pesticide exposure at first . However , when they presented their findings at the annual SENSOR @-@ Pesticides workshop in 2006 , they realized that all three mothers worked for the same tomato grower during the period of organogenesis while pregnant , and that they may have been exposed to pesticides . The state health departments reported the cluster to their respective state agricultural departments . The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services inspected the grower 's farms in Florida and fined the company $ 111 @,@ 200 for violations they discovered ; the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services conducted a similar inspection of farms in North Carolina and fined the company $ 184 @,@ 500 . After the investigation , North Carolina Governor Mike Easley assembled the “ Governor ’ s Task Force on Preventing Agricultural Pesticide Exposure . ” It presented its findings in April 2008 , which caused the state legislature to pass anti @-@ retaliation and recordkeeping laws , training mandates to protect the health of agricultural workers , and funding for improved surveillance . In Florida , the state legislature added ten new pesticide inspectors to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services .

 Total release foggers ( <unk> ) , or " bug bombs , " release a fog of insecticide to kill bugs in a room and coat surfaces with a chemical so the insects do not return . It is estimated that 50 million <unk> are used in the US annually . SENSOR @-@ Pesticides federal and state staff , along with officials from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation ( <unk> ) , published an article in the CDC MMWR that called attention to injuries and illnesses resulting from use of total release foggers . The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ( DEC ) published a press release in response , stating that the state would restrict their use . DEC Commissioner Pete <unk> announced that the department would move to classify foggers as a restricted @-@ use product in New York State , meaning that only certified pesticide applicators would be able to obtain them .

 Kent Ridge Park is a 47 @-@ hectare public park in western Singapore , between the National University of Singapore and the Singapore Science Park . Due to its undisturbed habitat and abundant plant life , it is a popular venue for bird @-@ watchers and eco @-@ tourists . 
 During the Second World War , a hill in the park was the site of one of the last and fiercest battles fought by the Malay Regiment against the invading Japanese army , the Battle of Bukit Chandu ( also known as the Battle of Pasir Panjang ) , 12 – 14 February 1942 . 
 The park was officially opened in 1954 , and was gazetted by the National Heritage Board as one of 11 World War II sites in Singapore in 1995 . It is one of over 300 parks managed by Singapore 's National Parks Board , NParks . 
 = = History = = 
 The area occupied by Kent Ridge Park and the National University of Singapore was formerly known as Pasir Panjang Ridge , and was originally a lowland evergreen rainforest . The park 's natural vegetation now consists of groves of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . When the first settlers arrived in Singapore in the early 19th century , they grew crops such as rubber , pepper , gambier and pineapple on the ridge . During World War II , it was used as a fortress by the British in the defence of Singapore . Many of the plantations were destroyed or abandoned during the Japanese Occupation ( 1942 – 1945 ) , allowing the crops to grow wild . 
 On 23 February 1954 , the Governor of Singapore , Sir John Fearns Nicoll unveiled a plaque which declared the area had been renamed Kent Ridge to commemorate the visit by the Duchess of Kent and her son , the Duke of Kent , on 3 October 1952 . The plaque was erected at the junction of what is now Kent Ridge Road and South Buona Vista Road . 
 The park contains Bukit Chandu , alternatively known as Opium Hill ( in Malay ) , after the opium processing factory owned by the British East India Company that was at the foot of the hill until 1910 . During 12 – 14 February 1942 , it was the site of the Battle of Bukit Chandu , fought by the 159 survivors of the Malay Regiment led by Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi against the 13 @,@ 000 men of Lieutenant @-@ General <unk> <unk> 's 18th Division . The Malay Regiment 's position on the hill was overrun by the Japanese and the battle ended in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat after the last few defenders ran out of ammunition . All the officers except one , Lieutenant Abbas Abdul @-@ Manan , and most of the men , were massacred in the aftermath . 
 = = The park today = = 
 Formerly used to house senior British Army officers , the last remaining black and white colonial bungalow at <unk> Bukit Chandu has been restored and converted into a World War II war museum called Reflections at Bukit Chandu , commemorating the war and those who fought in it . Originally there were two smaller bungalows below <unk> , but they were demolished in 1987 to make way for a public parking lot . There are three life @-@ size statues and a plaque outside the museum , honoring the Malay Regiment and commemorating the lives of those who died . 
 Kent Ridge Park , Labrador Park , and the war museum , are part of the Pasir Panjang Historic District , which focuses on WWII battlefield events in western Singapore . Together with Fort Siloso at Sentosa and The Battle Box at Fort Canning , they serve as a reminder of an important chapter in Singapore 's modern history . Near to the park 's children 's playground there is a heritage site marker , showing where the 1942 Battle of Pasir Panjang was fought . 
 The park also has some decommissioned military artillery – two <unk> 155 mm howitzer guns and an AMX @-@ 13 Light Tank on permanent display , donated by the Ministry of Defence , part of its adoption of the park as an Army Green Park in support of the National Parks Board " Adopt @-@ a @-@ Park " scheme to inculcate a greater ownership among the public of local parks and greenery ( do note that they are no longer there on display as of December 2015 ) . The park 's facilities include fitness corners , look @-@ out points , a nature trail , a multi @-@ purpose court and a canopy walk . The highest point of the park is 61 metres above sea level , from where there is a panoramic view of the coast of Pasir Panjang and some of the Southern Islands , approximately 5 km off the south @-@ western coast of Singapore . Islands such as Pulau Bukom and Pulau <unk> are visible on a clear day . 
 Kent Ridge park , Telok Blangah Hill Park , and Mount Faber Park are part of the Southern Ridges trail that links all 3 parks via connecting bridges and paths . 
 = = Plant and animal life = = 
 The park is managed by the National Parks Board , and is open daily to the public . Admission is free except for entrance to the war museum . The park is accessible via entrances on Vigilante Drive and Pepys Road , off Pasir Panjang Road . Most of the remaining wild part of the park comprises secondary forest with plants native to Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia such as tembusu , <unk> , white leaf fig , common <unk> , Singapore rhododendron , pitcher plants , cicada tree and <unk> air . 
 The trails through the park , including one for mountain biking , run almost parallel along the ridge . There is a natural pond with fishes and turtles in the north @-@ west of the park . A 280 @-@ metre long canopy walk was completed in the eastern part of the park in October 2003 , linking Kent Ridge Park to the war museum , Reflections at Bukit Chandu , enhancing the park 's and museum 's accessibility to the public . Along the walk , there are information boards providing educational information on the flora and fauna in the park . At the half @-@ way point , there is a shelter for visitors to take a short break or to enjoy a scenic view of Normanton Park and the National Parks Board 's plant nursery . 
 It is one of four popular birdwatching sites on mainland Singapore along with Pasir Ris Park , Fort Canning Park and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve . Birds found in the park include : white @-@ crested laughing thrush , collared kingfisher , white @-@ bellied sea eagle , banded woodpecker , pink @-@ necked pigeon , blue @-@ tailed bee @-@ eater , white @-@ breasted <unk> , and spotted dove . 
 Eco @-@ tours and heritage tours are regularly organised by various special interest groups such as the Nature Society Singapore and the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research , for students and the general public .

 Arsenal Football Club is an English professional football club based in Holloway , London , that plays in the Premier League , the top flight of English football . The club has won 12 FA Cups , a joint @-@ record , 13 League titles , two League Cups , 14 FA Community Shields , and one UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup and Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup . 
 Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League , in 1893 . They entered the First Division in 1904 , and have since accumulated the second most points . Relegated only once , in 1913 , they continue the longest streak in the top division . In the 1930s , Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups , and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war . In 1970 – 71 , they won their first League and FA Cup Double . Between 1988 and 2005 , they won five League titles and five FA Cups , including two more Doubles . They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position . 
 Herbert Chapman won Arsenal 's first national trophies , but died prematurely . The WM formation , floodlights , and shirt numbers have all been attributed to him . He added the white sleeves and brighter red to Arsenal 's kit . Arsène Wenger has served the longest and won the most trophies . His teams set several English records : the longest win streak ; the longest unbeaten run ; and the only 38 match season unbeaten . 
 In 1886 , Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square . In 1913 , the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury . They became Tottenham Hotspur 's nearest club , commencing the North London derby . In 2006 , they moved to the Emirates Stadium in nearby Holloway . Arsenal earned € <unk> in 2014 – 15 , with the Emirates Stadium generating the highest revenue in world football . Based on social media activity from 2014 – 15 , Arsenal 's fanbase is the fifth largest in the world . In 2016 , Forbes estimated the club was the second most valuable in England , worth $ 2 @.@ 0 billion .

 On 1 December 1886 , munitions workers in Woolwich , South East London , formed Arsenal as Dial Square , with David Danskin as their first captain . Named after the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex , they took the name of the whole complex a month later . Royal Arsenal F.C. ' s first home was Plumstead Common , though they spent most of their time in South East London playing on the other side of Plumstead , at the Manor Ground . Royal Arsenal won Arsenal 's first trophies in 1890 and 1891 , and these were the only football association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London . 
 Royal Arsenal renamed themselves for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893 . They registered their new name , Woolwich Arsenal , with The Football League when the club ascended later that year . Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League , starting out in the Second Division and winning promotion to the First Division in 1904 . Falling attendances , due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city , led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910 . Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall took the club over , and sought to move them elsewhere . 
 In 1913 , soon after relegation back to the Second Division , Woolwich Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury , North London . This saw their third change of name : the following year , they reduced Woolwich Arsenal to simply The Arsenal . In 1919 , The Football League voted to promote The Arsenal , instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur , into the newly enlarged First Division , despite only listing the club sixth in the Second Division 's last pre @-@ war season of 1914 – 15 . Some books have speculated that the club won this election to division one by dubious means . Later that year , The Arsenal started dropping " The " in official documents , gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal , as it is generally known today . 
 = = = 1919 – 1953 : The Bank of England Club = = = 
 With a new home and First Division football , attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground , and Arsenal 's budget grew rapidly . Their location and record @-@ breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925 . Over the next five years , Chapman built a new Arsenal . He appointed enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker , implemented Charlie Buchan 's new twist on the nascent WM formation , captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood , and lavished Highbury 's income on stars like David Jack and Alex James . With record @-@ breaking spending and gate receipts , Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England club . 
 Transformed , Chapman 's Arsenal claimed their first national trophy , the FA Cup , in 1930 . Two League Championships followed , in 1930 – 31 and 1932 – 33 . Chapman also presided over multiple off the pitch changes : white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kit ; a Tube station was named after the club ; and the first of two opulent , Art Deco stands was completed , with some of the first floodlights in English football . Suddenly , in the middle of the 1933 – 34 season , Chapman died of pneumonia . His work was left to Joe Shaw and George Allison , who saw out a hat @-@ trick with the 1933 – 34 and 1934 – 35 titles , and then won the 1936 FA Cup and 1937 – 38 title . 
 World War II meant The Football League was suspended for seven years , but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post @-@ war season , 1947 – 48 . This was Tom Whittaker 's first season as manager , after his promotion to succeed Allison , and the club had equalled the champions of England record . They won a third FA Cup in 1950 , and then won a record @-@ breaking seventh championship in 1952 – 53 . However , the war had taken its toll on Arsenal . The club had had more players killed than any top flight club , and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenal 's resources . 
 = = = 1953 – 1986 : The long sleep , Mee and Neill = = = 
 Arsenal were not to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years . The ' 53 Champions squad was old , and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements . Although Arsenal were competitive during these years , their fortunes had waned ; the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in <unk> mediocrity . Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager , in a stint between 1962 and 1966 . 
 Arsenal tentatively appointed club physiotherapist Bertie Mee as acting manager in 1966 . With new assistant Don Howe and new players such as Bob McNab and George Graham , Mee led Arsenal to their first League Cup finals , in 1967 – 68 and 1968 – 69 . Next season saw a breakthrough : Arsenal 's first competitive European trophy , the 1969 – 70 Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup . And the season after , an even greater triumph : Arsenal 's first League and FA Cup double , and a new champions of England record . This marked a premature high point of the decade ; the Double @-@ winning side was soon broken up and the rest of the decade was characterised by a series of near misses , starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972 , and First Division runners @-@ up in 1972 – 73 . 
 Former player Terry Neill succeeded Mee in 1976 . At the age of 34 , he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date . With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings , and a crop of talent in the side such as Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton , the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals ( 1978 , 1979 and 1980 ) , and lost the 1980 European Cup Winners ' Cup Final on penalties . The club 's only trophy during this time was a last @-@ minute 3 – 2 victory over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final , widely regarded as a classic . 
 = = = 1986 – present : Graham to Wenger = = = 
 One of Bertie Mee 's double winners , George Graham , returned as manager in 1986 . Arsenal won their first League Cup in 1987 , Graham 's first season in charge . By 1988 , new signings Nigel Winterburn , Lee Dixon and Steve Bould had joined the club to complete the " famous Back Four " led by existing player Tony Adams . They immediately won the 1988 – 89 Football League , snatched with a last @-@ minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers Liverpool . Graham 's Arsenal won another title in 1990 – 91 , losing only one match , won the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993 , and the European Cup Winners ' Cup , in 1994 . Graham 's reputation was tarnished when he was found to have taken kickbacks from agent Rune Hauge for signing certain players , and he was dismissed in 1995 . His permanent replacement , Bruce Rioch , lasted for only one season , leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors . 
 The club metamorphosed during the long tenure of manager Arsène Wenger , appointed in 1996 . New , attacking football , an overhaul of dietary and fitness practices , and efficiency with money have defined his reign . Accumulating key players from Wenger 's homeland , such as Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry , Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 1997 – 98 and a third in 2001 – 02 . In addition , the club reached the final of the 1999 – 2000 UEFA Cup , were victorious in the 2003 and 2005 FA Cups , and won the Premier League in 2003 – 04 without losing a single match , an achievement which earned the side the nickname " The Invincibles " . This latter feat came within a run of 49 league matches unbeaten from 7 May 2003 to 24 October 2004 , a national record . 
 Arsenal finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of Wenger 's first nine seasons at the club , although on no occasion were they able to retain the title . The club had never progressed beyond the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League until 2005 – 06 ; in that season they became the first club from London in the competition 's fifty @-@ year history to reach the final , in which they were beaten 2 – 1 by Barcelona . In July 2006 , they moved into the Emirates Stadium , after 93 years at Highbury . Arsenal reached the final of the 2007 and 2011 League Cups , losing 2 – 1 to Chelsea and Birmingham City respectively . 
 The club had not gained a major trophy since the 2005 FA Cup until 17 May 2014 , when Arsenal beat Hull City in the 2014 FA Cup Final , coming back from a 2 – 0 deficit to win the match 3 – 2 . This qualified them for the 2014 FA Community Shield where they would play Premier League champions Manchester City . They recorded a resounding 3 – 0 win in the game , winning their second trophy in three months . Nine months after their Community Shield triumph , Arsenal appeared in the FA Cup final for the second year in a row , thrashing Aston Villa 4 – 0 in the final and becoming the most successful club in the tournament 's history with 12 titles . On 2 August 2015 , Arsenal beat Chelsea 1 – 0 at Wembley Stadium to retain the Community Shield and earn their 14th Community Shield title . 
 = = Crest = = 
 Unveiled in 1888 , Royal Arsenal 's first crest featured three cannon viewed from above , pointing northwards , similar to the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich ( nowadays transferred to the coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich ) . These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys , but the presence of a carved lion 's head and a cascabel on each are clear indicators that they are cannon . This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913 , only to be reinstated in 1922 , when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon , pointing eastwards , with the club 's nickname , The Gunners , inscribed alongside it ; this crest only lasted until 1925 , when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down . 
 In 1949 , the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club 's name , set in blackletter , and above the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington and a scroll inscribed with the club 's newly adopted Latin motto , Victoria Concordia <unk> " victory comes from harmony " , coined by the club 's programme editor Harry Homer . For the first time , the crest was rendered in colour , which varied slightly over the crest 's lifespan , finally becoming red , gold and green . Because of the numerous revisions of the crest , Arsenal were unable to copyright it . Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark , and had fought ( and eventually won ) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold " unofficial " Arsenal merchandise , Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection . Therefore , in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style , which was copyrightable . The cannon once again faces east and the club 's name is written in a sans @-@ serif typeface above the cannon . Green was replaced by dark blue . The new crest was criticised by some supporters ; the Arsenal Independent Supporters ' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal 's history and tradition with such a radical modern design , and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue . 
 Until the 1960s , a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high @-@ profile matches such as FA Cup finals , usually in the form of a monogram of the club 's initials in red on a white background . 
 The monogram theme was developed into an Art Deco @-@ style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F , the whole set within a hexagonal border . This early example of a corporate logo , introduced as part of Herbert Chapman 's rebranding of the club in the 1930s , was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium , including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors . From 1967 , a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts , until replaced by the club crest , sometimes with the addition of the nickname " The Gunners " , in the 1990s . 
 In the 2011 – 12 season , Arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary . The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season . The crest was all white , surrounded by 15 oak leaves to the right and 15 laurel leaves to the left . The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub . The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club . The laurel leaves also represent strength . To complete the crest , 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto " Forward " at the bottom of the crest . 
 = = Colours = = 
 For much of Arsenal 's history , their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts , though this has not always been the case . The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest , soon after Arsenal 's foundation in 1886 . Two of Dial Square 's founding members , Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates , were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work . As they put together the first team in the area , no kit could be found , so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball . The shirt was redcurrant , a dark shade of red , and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops . 
 In 1933 , Herbert Chapman , wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed , updated the kit , adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red . Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves . One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt ; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster , with whom Chapman played golf . Regardless of which story is true , the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since , aside from two seasons . The first was 1966 – 67 , when Arsenal wore all @-@ red shirts ; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season . The second was 2005 – 06 , the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury , when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913 , their first season in the stadium ; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season . In the 2008 – 09 season , Arsenal replaced the traditional all @-@ white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe . 
 Arsenal 's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs . In 1909 , Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time ; in 1938 , Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip . In 1920 , Sporting Clube de Braga 's manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team 's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal 's red with white sleeves and shorts , giving rise to the team 's nickname of Os <unk> . These teams still wear those designs to this day . 
 For many years Arsenal 's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts . In the 1969 – 70 season , Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts . This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history . Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by Leeds United . Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their " lucky " yellow and blue strip , which remained the club 's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982 – 83 . The following season , Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme , albeit with a darker shade of blue than before . 
 When Nike took over from Adidas as Arsenal 's kit provider in 1994 , Arsenal 's away colours were again changed to two @-@ tone blue shirts and shorts . Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market , the away kits have been changed regularly , with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits . During this period the designs have been either all blue designs , or variations on the traditional yellow and blue , such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001 – 02 season , the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007 , and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013 . As of 2009 , the away kit is changed every season , and the outgoing away kit becomes the third @-@ choice kit if a new home kit is being introduced in the same year .

 Arsenal 's shirts have been made by manufacturers including Bukta ( from the 1930s until the early 1970s ) , Umbro ( from the 1970s until 1986 ) , Adidas ( 1986 – 1994 ) , Nike ( 1994 – 2014 ) , and Puma ( from 2014 ) . Like those of most other major football clubs , Arsenal 's shirts have featured sponsors ' logos since the 1980s ; sponsors include JVC ( 1982 – 1999 ) , Sega ( 1999 – 2002 ) , O2 ( 2002 – 2006 ) , and Emirates ( from 2006 ) . 
 = = Stadiums = = 
 For most of their time in south @-@ east London , Arsenal played at the Manor Ground in Plumstead , apart from a three @-@ year period at the nearby Invicta Ground between 1890 and 1893 . The Manor Ground was initially just a field , until the club installed stands and terracing for their first Football League match in September 1893 . They played their home games there for the next twenty years ( with two exceptions in the 1894 – 95 season ) , until the move to north London in 1913 . 
 Widely referred to as Highbury , Arsenal Stadium was the club 's home from September 1913 until May 2006 . The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch , and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time , with a single covered stand and three open @-@ air banks of terracing . The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s : new Art Deco West and East stands were constructed , opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively , and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace , which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954 . 
 Highbury could hold more than 60 @,@ 000 spectators at its peak , and had a capacity of 57 @,@ 000 until the early 1990s . The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all @-@ seater stadium in time for the 1993 – 94 season , thus reducing the capacity to 38 @,@ 419 seated spectators . This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards , so much so that for two seasons , from 1998 to 2000 , Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley , which could house more than 70 @,@ 000 spectators . 
 Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties . These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century , putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time . After considering various options , in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60 @,@ 361 @-@ capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove , since named the Emirates Stadium , about 500 metres south @-@ west of Highbury . The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs , and construction was completed in July 2006 , in time for the start of the 2006 – 07 season . The stadium was named after its sponsors , the airline company Emirates , with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history , worth around £ 100 million . Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove , or the Grove , as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names . The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028 , and the airline will be the club 's shirt sponsor until the end of the 2018 – 19 season . From the start of the 2010 – 11 season on , the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank , East Stand , West Stand and Clock end . 
 Arsenal 's players train at the Shenley Training Centre in Hertfordshire , a purpose @-@ built facility which opened in 1999 . Before that the club used facilities on a nearby site owned by the University College of London Students ' Union . Until 1961 they had trained at Highbury . Arsenal 's Academy under @-@ 18 teams play their home matches at Shenley , while the reserves play their games at Meadow Park , which is also the home of Boreham Wood F.C .. 
 = = Supporters = = 
 Arsenal fans often refer to themselves as " <unk> " , the name derived from the team 's nickname , " The Gunners " . The fanbase is large and generally loyal , and virtually all home matches sell out ; in 2007 – 08 Arsenal had the second @-@ highest average League attendance for an English club ( 60 @,@ 070 , which was 99 @.@ 5 % of available capacity ) , and , as of 2015 , the third @-@ highest all @-@ time average attendance . Arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund , FC Barcelona , Manchester United , Real Madrid , Bayern Munich , and Schalke . The club 's location , adjoining wealthy areas such as Canonbury and <unk> , mixed areas such as Islington , Holloway , Highbury , and the adjacent London Borough of Camden , and largely working @-@ class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington , has meant that Arsenal 's supporters have come from a variety of social classes . 
 Like all major English football clubs , Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters ' clubs , including the Arsenal Football Supporters ' Club , which works closely with the club , and the Arsenal Independent Supporters ' Association , which maintains a more independent line . The Arsenal Supporters ' Trust promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans . The club 's supporters also publish fanzines such as The <unk> , <unk> and the satirical Up The Arse ! . In addition to the usual English football chants , supporters sing " One @-@ Nil to the Arsenal " ( to the tune of " Go West " ) . 
 There have always been Arsenal supporters outside London , and since the advent of satellite television , a supporter 's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography . Consequently , Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world ; in 2007 , 24 UK , 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club . A 2011 report by SPORT + <unk> estimated Arsenal 's global fanbase at 113 million . The club 's social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014 – 15 season . 
 Arsenal 's longest @-@ running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbours , Tottenham Hotspur ; matches between the two are referred to as North London derbies . Other rivalries within London include those with Chelsea , Fulham and West Ham United . In addition , Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on @-@ pitch rivalry in the late 1980s , which intensified in recent years when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title – so much so that a 2003 online poll by the Football Fans Census listed Manchester United as Arsenal 's biggest rivals , followed by Tottenham and Chelsea . A 2008 poll listed the Tottenham rivalry as more important .

 The largest shareholder on the Arsenal board is American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke . Kroenke first launched a bid for the club in April 2007 , and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities , which acquired its first shares off David Dein in August 2007 . Red & White Securities was co @-@ owned by Russian billionaire <unk> <unk> and Iranian London @-@ based financier Farhad <unk> , though <unk> bought <unk> 's stake in 2016 . Kroenke came close to the 30 % takeover threshold in November 2009 , when he increased his holding to 18 @,@ 594 shares ( 29 @.@ 9 % ) . In April 2011 , Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell @-@ Smith and Danny <unk> , taking his shareholding to 62 @.@ 89 % . As of June 2015 , Kroenke owns 41 @,@ 698 shares ( 67 @.@ 02 % ) and Red & White Securities own 18 @,@ 695 shares ( 30 @.@ 04 % ) . Ivan Gazidis has been the club 's Chief Executive since 2009 . 
 Arsenal 's parent company , Arsenal Holdings plc , operates as a non @-@ quoted public limited company , whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs . Only 62 @,@ 217 shares in Arsenal have been issued , and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM ; instead , they are traded relatively infrequently on the <unk> Securities and Derivatives Exchange , a specialist market . On 10 March 2016 , a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £ 15 @,@ 670 , which sets the club 's market capitalisation value at approximately £ <unk> . Most football clubs aren 't listed on an exchange , which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult .

Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $ 2 @.@ 0 billion ( £ 1 @.@ 4 billion ) in 2016 , ranked second in English football .

 Arsenal have appeared in a number of media " firsts " . On 22 January 1927 , their match at Highbury against Sheffield United was the first English League match to be broadcast live on radio . A decade later , on 16 September 1937 , an exhibition match between Arsenal 's first team and the reserves was the first football match in the world to be televised live . Arsenal also featured in the first edition of the BBC 's Match of the Day , which screened highlights of their match against Liverpool at Anfield on 22 August 1964 . BSkyB 's coverage of Arsenal 's January 2010 match against Manchester United was the first live public broadcast of a sports event on 3D television . 
 As one of the most successful teams in the country , Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain . They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football @-@ related films , The Arsenal Stadium Mystery ( 1939 ) . The film centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side , one of whose players is poisoned while playing . Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves and manager George Allison was given a speaking part . More recently , the book Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornby 's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular . Published in 1992 , it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s . The book was twice adapted for the cinema – the 1997 British film focuses on Arsenal 's 1988 – 89 title win , and a 2005 American version features a fan of baseball 's Boston Red Sox ; coincidentally the ending was re @-@ made to feature the 2004 – 05 season that ended in a similar fashion . 
 Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a defensive and " boring " side , especially during the 1970s and 1980s ; many comedians , such as Eric Morecambe , made jokes about this at the team 's expense . The theme was repeated in the 1997 film The Full Monty , in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands , deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence 's offside trap , in an attempt to co @-@ ordinate their striptease routine . Another film reference to the club 's defence comes in the film Plunkett & Macleane , in which two characters are named Dixon and Winterburn after Arsenal 's long @-@ serving full backs – the right @-@ sided Lee Dixon and the left @-@ sided Nigel Winterburn . 
 The 1991 television comedy sketch show Harry Enfield & Chums featured a sketch from the characters Mr <unk> @-@ Warner and Grayson where the Arsenal team of 1933 , featuring exaggerated parodies of fictitious amateur players take on the Liverpool team of 1991 . 
 In the 2007 movie , Goal II : Living the Dream , there is a fictional UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid against Arsenal . 
 The 2008 Nike ad , named " Take it to The next level " , follows an unknown teenager who is plucked from a youth team game by Arsene Wenger and ends up starring for Arsenal and Holland .

Arsenal Ladies are the most successful team in English women 's football . In the 2008 – 09 season , they won all three major English trophies – the FA Women 's Premier League , FA Women 's Cup and FA Women 's Premier League Cup , and , as of 2009 , were the only English side to have won the UEFA Women 's Cup , having done so in the 2006 – 07 season as part of a unique quadruple . The men 's and women 's clubs are formally separate entities but have quite close ties ; Arsenal Ladies are entitled to play once a season at the Emirates Stadium , though they usually play their home matches at Boreham Wood .

 = Hypogeomys australis = 
 Hypogeomys australis is an extinct rodent from central and southeastern Madagascar . First described in 1903 , it is larger than its close relative , the living Hypogeomys antimena , which occurs further west , but otherwise similar . Average length of the femur ( upper leg bone ) is 72 @.@ 1 mm , compared to 63 @.@ 8 mm in H. antimena . One of the few extinct rodents of Madagascar , it survived to at least around 1536 BP based on radiocarbon dating . Little is known of its ecology , but it may have lived in burrows like its living relative and eaten some arid @-@ adapted plants . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Hypogeomys australis was described in 1903 by Guillaume Grandidier from subfossil material collected in the cave of Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar . The Hypogeomys material was similar to the living Hypogeomys antimena , but distinct enough for Grandidier to recognize it as a separate species , different in size and some morphological details . Grandidier described another subfossil Hypogeomys species in 1912 , H. boulei , but the material that species was based on was later identified as the enigmatic mammal Plesiorycteropus . In 1946 , Charles Lamberton illustrated another femur ( upper leg bone ) of H. australis ; the origin and current whereabouts of this specimen are unknown . In 1996 , Steven Goodman and Daniel <unk> reviewed the distribution of Hypogeomys and confirmed that H. australis is a distinct species . H. australis and H. antimena are classified together within the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae , which includes various African rodents . 
 = = Description = = 
 Hypogeomys australis was generally similar to H. antimena , the largest living rodent of Madagascar , but even larger , with little if any overlap in measurements . Grandidier described the extinct species as more robust , with more prominent muscle scars on the long bones and with longer molars with more distinct crests and lobes . The length of the first lower molar is 5 @.@ 2 to 6 @.@ 4 mm , averaging 5 @.@ 7 mm , in ten H. australis and 3 @.@ 9 to 5 @.@ 5 mm , averaging 4 @.@ 8 mm , in twenty @-@ four H. antimena . The width of the femur at the proximal ( near ) end is 18 @.@ 6 to 21 @.@ 5 mm , averaging 19 @.@ 9 mm , in thirteen H. australis and 16 @.@ 8 to 18 @.@ 5 mm , averaging 17 @.@ 5 mm , in nine H. antimena . In ten H. australis , total length of the femur is 69 @.@ 9 to 75 @.@ 1 mm , averaging 72 @.@ 1 mm , compared to 59 @.@ 7 to 69 @.@ 9 mm , averaging 63 @.@ 8 mm in nine H. antimena . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Remains attributed to Hypogeomys australis are known from Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar and Antsirabe in central Madagascar , suggesting a broad former distribution . Its range is not known to overlap that of H. antimena , which has undergone a dramatic reduction during the Holocene . A bone from Andrahomana has been radiocarbon dated to about <unk> BP and another to 1536 BP . Although almost nothing is known of the ecology of H. australis , Goodman and <unk> presumed that it was similar to its living relative in living in burrows in areas with loose soils . H. australis shows relatively high content of carbon @-@ 13 isotope , likely because it ate some plants which were enriched in carbon @-@ 13 through C4 carbon fixation and crassulacean acid metabolism ; both of these photosynthesis @-@ related processes occur most frequently in plants adapted to dry environments . 
 Hypogeomys australis is one of only three extinct rodents known from Madagascar ( the others are Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis and Nesomys narindaensis from northwestern Madagascar ) . In general , few small animals became extinct on Madagascar , except for these rodents , two species of Plesiorycteropus , and the shrew tenrec Microgale macpheei ; in contrast , large animals such as subfossil lemurs , the carnivore Cryptoprocta spelea , Malagasy hippopotamuses , <unk> tortoises , and <unk> and <unk> birds all became extinct around the time that humans arrived . 
 = Eisenhower Tunnel = 
 The Eisenhower Tunnel , officially the Eisenhower – Edwin C. Johnson Memorial Tunnel , is a dual @-@ bore , four @-@ lane vehicular tunnel approximately 60 mi ( 97 km ) west of Denver , Colorado , United States . The tunnel carries Interstate 70 under the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains . With a maximum elevation of 11 @,@ 158 ft ( 3 @,@ 401 m ) AMSL , it is one of the highest vehicular tunnels in the world . The tunnel is the longest mountain tunnel and highest point on the Interstate Highway System . Completed in 1979 , it was one of the last major pieces of the Interstate Highway system to be completed . The westbound bore is named after Dwight D. Eisenhower , the U.S. President for whom the Interstate system is also named . The eastbound bore is named for Edwin C. Johnson , a governor and U.S. Senator who lobbied for an Interstate Highway to be built across Colorado . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Eisenhower bore ( westbound tunnel ) is 1 @.@ 693 mi ( 2 @.@ 72 km ) long while the Johnson bore ( eastbound tunnel ) is 1 @.@ 697 mi ( 2 @.@ 73 km ) long . The tunnels are sloped with a 1 @.@ 64 % grade , with an elevation of 11 @,@ 013 feet ( 3 @,@ 357 m ) at the east portal and 11 @,@ 158 ft ( 3 @,@ 401 m ) at the west portal . At the time of dedication , they were the highest vehicular tunnels in the world . While the Eisenhower Tunnel remains the highest vehicular tunnel in the United States , higher tunnels have since been constructed elsewhere , such as the <unk> Tunnel , a rail tunnel in China . The Eisenhower tunnel is noted as the longest mountain tunnel and highest point on the Interstate Highway System . The tunnel bores measure 48 feet ( 15 m ) by 40 feet ( 12 m ) ; however , the portion accessible to the public is a square shape measuring just over 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) tall . The rest of the bore is used for forced air ventilation and water drainage systems . 
 = = = Height restriction = = = 
 Due to additional height restrictions from variable @-@ message signs and lighting systems , the original posted clearance of the tunnels was 13 @.@ 5 feet ( 4 @.@ 1 m ) . The trucking industry lobbied the Colorado Department of Transportation ( CDOT ) to increase the vertical clearance of the tunnel . With a 2007 retrofit that used lower profile lighting and signs , it is now possible for trucks 13 @.@ 92 feet ( 4 @.@ 24 m ) to navigate the tunnel , an increase of 5 inches ( 13 cm ) over the original limit . Sensors activate audible sirens near each entrance of the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel . Traffic signals at that entrance will turn red , stopping all traffic . The entrance will remain closed until the over @-@ height vehicle is removed from the freeway , sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic . CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit , about 20 @,@ 000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm . The trucking industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions ( which can be manually lowered for the duration of the journey through the tunnel ) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer . During this time , the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80 % if the clearance could be raised even a few inches . Another feature of the retrofit monitors truck weight — a safe speed for each truck on the 7 % grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver . 
 = = = Alternate route = = = 
 To mitigate the dangers posed by a fire inside the tunnel , trucks hauling hazardous materials are also prohibited from using the tunnel . Prohibited trucks , bicycles , pedestrians and those who wish to stop and view the scenery must take the longer and steeper climb and descent of the older U.S. Highway 6 across Loveland Pass , 834 ft ( 254 m ) higher at 11 @,@ 992 ft ( 3 @,@ 655 m ) above sea level . Other than the above exceptions , the tunnel has replaced the pass for general vehicular traffic . While less formidable than the older route , the approach to the tunnel on both sides is steep , and runaway truck ramps are available for truckers who lose control . 
 During construction or winter storms that require closing Loveland Pass , there is a procedure in place to allow hazardous material trucks to use the tunnel . Once per hour , the tunnel bores will be closed to regular traffic , and the trucks will be guided through the tunnel in a convoy with escorts . 
 As of December 2009 , almost 276 million vehicles have passed through the tunnel . This figure includes a significant number of visitors to Colorado 's ski resorts . 
 = = History = = 
 The idea for a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed at least since the 1940s . Serious discussion began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado . After a round of negotiations with Utah officials , it was decided the best option was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor . Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass , rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate Highway standards . 
 The Eisenhower – Johnson Memorial Tunnel was known as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction , named for the waterway that runs along the western approach to the tunnel . Before the tunnel was dedicated , it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson . Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15 , 1968 . Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget . One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines in the path of the tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores . These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave @-@ ins and collapses . Despite the best efforts of engineers , three workers were killed boring the first tube , and four in boring the second . 
 Further complicating construction , the boring machines could not work as fast as expected at such high elevations ; the productivity was significantly less than planned . The frustration prompted one engineer to comment , " We were going by the book , but the damned mountain couldn 't read " . Though the project was supposed to take three years , the tunnel was not opened to traffic until March 8 , 1973 . Initially , the northern Eisenhower bore was used for two @-@ way traffic , with one lane for each direction . The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions , and efforts soon began to expedite construction on the southern bore . Construction began on the eastbound Edwin C. Johnson tunnel on August 18 , 1975 and finished on December 21 , 1979 . The initial engineering cost estimate for the Eisenhower bore was $ 42 million ; the actual cost was $ 108 million ( equivalent to $ 576 million in 2016 ) . Approximately 90 % of the funds were paid by the federal government , with the state of Colorado paying the rest . At the time , this figure set a record for the most expensive federally aided project . The excavation cost for the Johnson bore was $ 102 @.@ 8 million ( equivalent to $ 335 million in 2016 ) . Not included in these figures is about $ 50 million in non @-@ boring expenses in the construction of both tunnels . 
 The tunnel construction became unintentionally involved in the women 's rights movement when Janet Bonnema applied for work with the Colorado Department of Transportation . She was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project , but her supervisor misread her resume and thought he was hiring " James " . When the supervisor discovered the department had hired a woman , she was instead tasked with doing support work from the office . There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site : One supervisor stated that if she entered , " Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they 'd never come back " . The workers , most of whom had a mining background , expressed a common superstition that a woman brought bad luck to a mine . One worker insisted , " It 's a jinx . I 've seen too many die after a woman was in the tunnel . " Bonnema sued the department for the right to work inside the tunnel . She countered that she was in better shape and more agile than most of the men working on the tunnel . Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado , she finally entered the tunnel , with an entourage of reporters , on November 9 , 1972 . Some workers did walk off the job ; at least one yelled , " Get those women out of here " . She remained determined and re @-@ entered the tunnel a few days later . The next time she dressed in coveralls , and was even assigned tasks on the roof of the tunnel overlooking the men below . Surprised that nobody apparently noticed she was a woman , she stated , " I had a good disguise " . 
 = = = Plane crash = = = 
 During construction in 1970 , a plane crash occurred less than two miles ( 3 km ) northeast of the east portal on Friday , October 2 .

The team was on its way to a game with Utah State University in Logan , and had recently refueled at Denver 's Stapleton International Airport . The other plane took a different route and landed safely in Logan . Workers constructing the tunnel were among the first on scene at the crash site . 
 = = Water Diversion = = 
 As with the Moffat Tunnel , while the Eisenhower Tunnel was primarily intended as a transportation tunnel , it also serves as a water tunnel for water diversion from the western side of the Continental Divide to the eastern side . Water from the Straight Creek watershed ( a tributary of the Blue River ) , along with all seepage entering the tunnel is discharged into Clear Creek for delivery to the Coors Brewing Company . Typically , the tunnel delivers over 300 acre @-@ feet ( 370 @,@ 000 m3 ) of water per year . 
 = Artpop ( song ) = 
 " Artpop " ( stylized as " ARTPOP " ) is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga from her third studio album of the same name ( 2013 ) . The song was written and produced by Lady Gaga , Paul " DJ White Shadow " Blair , Nick Monson , and Dino Zisis . " Artpop " was the first song developed for the album and led the composers to pursue other avenues of musical production . Described as the backbone of the record , Gaga did not want to experiment with the production of " Artpop " , as she believed it to have an infinite aspect in it . 
 A techno song , " Artpop " features instrumentation from piano and guitars and has computerized musical sounds interspersed in between . The lyrics have been interpreted in different ways , about a love relationship , Gaga 's bonding with her fans , the merging of art and pop , as well as using them to portray her brand value and generate further interest in her . " Artpop " received mixed reviews from critics who praised the low @-@ key composition of the song compared to other tracks on the album , but panned the lyrics and the dated production . 
 " Artpop " was used in a " not safe for work " video for the album , which featured Gaga in various bizarre attires and a montage of the different promotional material leading to the release . Gaga had premiered " Artpop " during her iTunes Festival performance of tracks from the album . She subsequently performed it at her ArtRave party , on the Lady Gaga and the Muppets ' Holiday Spectacular on ABC with singer Elton John and most recently on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 Development of Lady Gaga 's third studio album , Artpop , began shortly after the release of her second one , Born This Way ( 2011 ) , and by the following year , the album 's concepts were " beginning to flourish " as Gaga collaborated with producers Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow . However , while on tour for the Born This Way Ball , Gaga had to undergo a hip surgery in February 2013 which forced the singer into a six month hiatus , and this rehabilitation became one of the inspirations behind the album . According to White Shadow , the title track was one of the first songs penned for the album , which created the backbone for the record . Calling it a " defining moment " of Artpop 's creation , the producer explained that the title track led them to explore other avenues in terms of musical aspirations . Written and produced by Gaga , White Shadow , Nick Monson and Dino Zisis , " Artpop " was called the swan song of the album by the singer . Talking to Sirius XM Radio , where she gave an in @-@ depth analysis of each song from the album , Gaga explained : 
 <unk> ' is really an inferno and it 's the only song on the record that I didn 't really wanna go anywhere or explode or orgasm . Because then it would just be like composing something that would be just like every other sort of orgasm that I 've ever had . And because its really the center of the record , I really wanted there to be a more infinite tone , to this concept of Art + Pop , that we can put art in the front and not have the corporate world to control in art anymore . How can we the artist back our ideas and for our visions to be the most important thing . The thing that 's driving culture , driving these corporations . I didn 't wanted [ ' Artpop ' ] to grow too much , I wanted it to kind of hypnotize people and become like a mantra . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 Initial recording sessions for Artpop coincided with the Born This Way Ball . Gaga spent the majority of her recording time on " Artpop " with White Shadow but she did not want the final version to be edited further , unlike her other songs . The song was recorded at Record Plant Studios , Hollywood , California , by Dave Russell and Benjamin Lader , with Lader and Daniel <unk> also working as assistants during the final mix . Russell also did the mixing of the track for the track at Record Plant and at Heard It ! Studios with additional mixing being done by Dino " <unk> " Zisis . Instrumentation for " Artpop " included piano and guitars by Gaga and Nick Monson . Background vocals were sung by Nichole <unk> , Natalie <unk> and Lyon Gray with vocal arrangement by Gaga . Finally , Rick Pearl did the additional programming and Gene Grimaldi did the audio mastering at Oasis Mastering Studios in Burbank , California . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com , " Artpop " is set in the time signature of common time , with a dance @-@ pop tempo of 117 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of D minor with Gaga 's vocals spanning the tonal nodes of F3 to A4 . The song follows a basic sequence of Dm – Gm – F – C as its chord progression . 
 In a review for Billboard , Jason Lipshutz described " Artpop " as Gaga 's manifesto about her creativity , calling it a " lurching electro @-@ jazz beast " who 's beats became louder and complex as it reached climax . Consisting of strings , the techno song has a beat similar to Selena Gomez 's 2011 single " Love You like a Love Song " with its electronic composition , and a groove comparable to singer Kylie Minogue 's 2001 hit single " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " . Interspersed between are computerized musical sounds and the chorus , which has a coo @-@ ing accompanied with the main vocals , like Michael Jackson , and was described by Kevin Harley from The Independent as " sleek Eurodisco " . " Artpop " ' s lyrics have been deduced to be a statement about " the subjectivity of art " . It begins with the singer uttering the lines " Come to me with all your subtext of fantasy " , the line being an indicative of enigma around her , according to The Huffington Post . Gaga explained the lyrics were a metaphor about love with the chorus line " We could belong together , Artpop " . She believed that if her fans and herself could be together , that would probably mean a bonding for art and pop too . On the contrary , Jim Farber from New York Daily News believed that the love relationship was sidelined for that between art and pop with the lyrics . 
 There are other dimensions to the lyrics , with Gaga playing off her image of self @-@ promotion and criticisms directed at her with the line " I try to sell myself , but I am really laughing because I just want the music not the bling " . In a review for Artpop , Simon Chandler from Tiny Mix Tapes gave a detailed analysis of the lyrical composition . According to him , Gaga wanted to portray her music as boundless in its meaning with " Artpop " , but it appeared to be arrogant since most of the conclusions derived about her music is from her public persona created and its media coverage . Chandler believed that the lyrics wanted to drive home a point about Gaga being the center for any discussion . With the previous lyrics , the implication is that Gaga 's impassive personality utilizes her music to sell her brand name to the general crowd , and primarily fuels the public interest in her . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 A teaser for " Artpop " was previewed as part of snippets from the parent album until its final release on November 11 , 2013 . A " not safe for work " short film , An Artpop Film Starring Lady Gaga , set to the song was released as promotion for the album , on November 20 , 2013 . Shot by Dutch fashion photographer duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin , the video consisted of the material that Gaga created with them as promotion leading to Artpop . The video begins with a nude Gaga uttering a monologue : " This album is a celebration . My pain exploding in electronic music . It 's heavy , but after I listen to it I feel happy again . I feel lighter . " Following these are the black @-@ and @-@ white promotional scenes from Artpop campaign announcement , the music video for the first single " Applause " , the nude images for her interview with V magazine and the artwork for promotional single , " Dope " . Gaga shows a range of emotion in the film , including caressing a mannequin and applying dirt on her body , but most of the time she simply stares towards the camera . <unk> Rivera from New York Daily News expressed her difficulty in understanding the film , but added that " hypnotic musical backdrop of her single ' Artpop ' perfectly matches the artsy , bewildering and even disturbing images that run through the fast and slow editing . " Gaga admitted that she had performed for 12 hours while making the film . 
 The track received mixed reviews from music critics . Mike Wass from Idolator called it an " obtuse synth track " believing the composition to be " ingenious " or " pretentious " , and felt that Gaga 's endeavors kept the pop music scene interesting . Evan Sawdey from PopMatters believed that the vibe of the previous track on the album , " Do What U Want " , carried off to " Artpop " which he described as " strange " and " <unk> " and the best thing on the parent album . Harley listed " Artpop " as one of the more aurally pleasurable tracks from the album . Calling it a " standout " track , Andrew Barker from Variety compared Gaga 's vocals to those of Debbie Harry , with their cold disposition . Emily <unk> from NME called the song " slow and <unk> sexy " , believing that the line " My <unk> could mean anything " referred to the trivial concept of the album itself . Critic Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune believed that " Artpop " was the only song on the album , where there was a hint of what the actual composition of the over all record should have been . Justin Miller from Harper 's Bazaar called the song more intimate that the previous tracks in the album , but felt it was a techno @-@ ballad and the most diffused composition for Gaga . 
 Negative reviews came from Holly Williams of Contactmusic.com , who was extremely disappointed with the track . Williams felt a rapid decline in the quality of music with the title track , which she believed should have been " climactic , inventive and a little bit trippy with such a title " but found its tempo to be slow and mundane . Maura Johnson from Spin felt that lyrics like " I just love the music , not the bling " appeared insincere on Gaga 's behalf since her career graph showed that the singer was more infatuated with Fame in the 21st century . " Not the deepest statement , but also not that unique to the new millennium , " Johnson concluded . Los Angeles Times 's Mikael Wood believed that the line was not something that worked in a pop record and believed that along with first single " Applause " , Gaga 's ideas seemed unattainable and not exciting . John Walker from MTV News rated it two out of five stars , calling it boring . Chris Bossman from Consequence of Sound compared the composition of the track to a " dying , old school war <unk> " . Melinda Newman from HitFix called the song " too quirky " and felt that it could only be successful if remixed properly . Robert Copsey from Digital Spy believed that the chorus line " My <unk> could mean anything " made the concept of the album all the more confusing , instead of simplifying Gaga 's brash statements about her musical outputs . Ericka Welch from The Huffington Post called the song as " pretentious " and the least interesting endeavor on the album . She believed that " Artpop " failed to embody the concept of the album and was plagued with the same inconsequential lyrics that was visible during her Born This Way era . She concluded by giving the example : " Like a mad scientist trying to create life , Gaga 's experiment to fuse ART and POP sometimes results in overly ambitious deformities with six legs . "

 Previous to the release of the album or the teasers , Gaga performed " Artpop " live on September 1 , 2013 , at the iTunes Festival in London . The song was the third performance that evening , from a set list containing eight tracks . Following the performance of " Manicure " and a piano interlude , Gaga stripped off her cloths onstage until she was in a sea @-@ shell bikini and an enormous blond wig , and started singing the song . Ashley Percival from The Huffington Post complimented the performance , saying that the song " showed the most promise onstage " . A review at Capital FM website found the song akin to her 2009 single , " Paparazzi " . Jenn Selby from Glamour called the performance a " heartfelt piece of pop music accompanied with its own , YMCA @-@ like arm dance . " Digital Spy 's Copsey was confused with the performance , but enjoyed the downtempo composition of " Artpop " and rated it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . Writing for The Guardian , Kitty Empire criticized the absence of clothing but praised the overall performance . Gaga next performed " Artpop " during her ArtRave party for the release of the album . Wearing an ensemble that was described by New York Post 's Hardeep Phull as a combination of S & M and the Michelin Man , Gaga performed " Artpop " after opening the ArtRave concert with " Aura " , the first track of the album . The singer had to wade through the crowd of her fans in order to reach the main stage where the rest of the performance took place . 
 Gaga performed the song on Lady Gaga and the Muppets ' Holiday Spectacular , her second Thanksgiving television special which aired on ABC on November 28 , 2013 . She had invited singer Elton John as special guest star for the performance . After a performance of John 's 1974 single " Bennie and the Jets " , the duo started singing " Artpop " . They were seated opposite to each other on piano , and Gaga was ornamented in a dress made of Coca Cola cans . During the chorus , they were joined by The Muppets who aided with background vocals . Chris Willman from Billboard called John as the best guest performer of the special . <unk> Gonzales from Entertainment Weekly was impressed with the performance , saying that although she did not understand the message behind the song , " [ w ] hat is clear is that Gaga and Elton John belong together . I 'm serious , I want to go to that show . " 
 She also performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on February 18 , 2014 . The performance was the restart of Gaga 's emergence under media spotlight , following a self @-@ imposed sabbatical due to depression and stories about betrayal surrounding the release of Artpop . The singer wore a white dress and sported a platinum blond wig ; the ensemble made her look like fashion designer Donatella Versace . Starting the song as an acoustic version , Gaga played a crystal piano placed atop a ramp at the end of the stage . By the second chorus , the electronic beats of the song started and she descended to the front of the stage to complete the performance with a dance . Carl Williot from Idolator complimented the performance , saying that it made him appreciate the track more . It was praised by Melinda Newman from HitFix who said that " Gaga excels when it is just her at a piano performing the songs with the barest of accompaniment . " At the ArtRave : The Artpop Ball tour of 2014 , " Artpop " was added as the opening song of the set list . The show starts off with a video introduction about the tour , followed by dancers appearing on stage with balloons and blue gazing balls . The video continues to play as Gaga emerges from beneath the stage , wearing a golden leotard with wings and a blue ball attached to her bosom . Dry ice and confetti accompanied her arrival on stage , as Gaga sang the song standing atop two male dancers wearing scuba diving masks .

 = Walter Walsh = 
 Colonel Walter Rudolph Walsh ( May 4 , 1907 – April 29 , 2014 ) was an FBI agent , USMC shooting instructor and Olympic shooter . Walsh joined the FBI in 1934 , serving during the Public enemy era , and was involved in several high @-@ profile FBI cases , including the capture of Arthur Barker and the killing of Al Brady . He served in the Pacific theatre during World War II with the Marine Corps and , after a brief return to the FBI , served as a shooting instructor with the Marine Corps until his retirement in the 1970s . 
 A high profile shooter , Walsh won numerous tournaments within the FBI and the Marine Corps , as well as nationally , and participated in the 1948 Summer Olympics . He received awards for his marksmanship until the age of 90 and served as the coach of the Olympic shooting team until 2000 . At the FBI 's 100th anniversary celebration he was recognized as the oldest living former agent and noted as being a year older than the organization itself . Aside from some hearing and memory loss , he remained physically fit at his 103rd birthday and , in March 2013 , became the longest @-@ lived Olympic competitor . 
 = = Early life and FBI career = = 
 Walsh was born in West Hoboken , New Jersey , which merged with Union Hill to become Union City in 1925 . He joined the Civilian Military Training Corps at age 16 , and the New Jersey Army National Guard in 1928 . After graduating from Rutgers Law School , Walsh joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1934 . Later that year , he discovered the body of gangster Baby Face Nelson , who died of injuries sustained in a gun battle with the police in Barrington , Illinois on November 27 , 1934 . Nelson had killed two FBI agents prior to fleeing the scene , wounded , and later died at his wife 's side . The FBI , unaware of Nelson 's death , continued a broad search for him , which included several home raids , through the night and into the following day . The search was not called off until a tip led them to Nelson 's body , which was lying in a ditch in what is now Skokie , Illinois . 
 Walsh was on the team that captured criminal Arthur Barker , son of gangster Ma Barker , in Chicago in 1935 and was later involved in tracking Public Enemy Number One Al Brady in 1937 . On October 12 of that year , he was with the group of FBI agents who ambushed and killed Brady in a shoot @-@ out at a Bangor , Maine sporting goods store . While waiting for Brady to arrive , he acted as a clerk in the store for several days and arrested Brady Gang member James Dalhover . As the operation leader , Walsh 's job was to alert thirteen other agents , as well as over 30 other state and local policemen , of any gang member 's arrival by pulling a cord on the window . As they were interrogating Dalhover in the store Clarence Lee Shaffer , Jr . , another gang member , entered the building and began firing at the agents . While arresting Dalhover , Walsh took bullets to his hand , shoulder and right chest , but quickly returned to work . 
 Walsh was employed with the FBI until 1942 when , as a Reserve Marine Lieutenant , he took a leave to serve with the United States Marine Corps during World War II . After he left , Hoover refused to allow any more active agents to be members of any military reserve . He fought in the Pacific Theater , specifically on Okinawa and in North China . In one incident , he and his comrades were pinned down by a sniper , whom Walsh was able to kill from 90 yards away with a single shot to the torso from a M1911 pistol . He earned the rank of Colonel and returned to the FBI for two years from 1946 – 1947 . In total , during his tenure with the agency , he killed between 11 and 17 suspects .

 Walsh got his start with firearms shooting <unk> off of his aunt 's laundry line . In 1935 he joined the FBI pistol team . Within three years of joining the FBI , he had been presented with two marksmanship trophies from director J. Edgar Hoover . In 1939 , at Camp Ritchie , he set the world record in pistol shooting with 198 points out of a possible 200 and won the individual eastern regional pistol championships in 1939 and 1940 and placing second in 1941 after leading for most of the tournament . He placed 12th in the Men 's Free Pistol , 50 metres competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London , England . At the 1952 ISSF World Shooting Championships , he won a gold medal with the United States team in the 25 m Center @-@ Fire Pistol event and a silver in the individual version of that event . After winning many tournaments within the United States Marine Corps , he became commander of their marksmanship training , a position that he held for many years , until he retired in the 1970s . In total , he was selected five times for the All @-@ American Pistol Shooting Team .

 Walsh had three daughters , two sons and seventeen grandchildren . As late as 1997 , he was still receiving awards for his marksmanship , winning the Outstanding American <unk> of the Year . Until 2000 he served as a coach for the Olympic shooting team , able to see without the aid of glasses even at the age of 92 . At the age of 100 he was present at a re @-@ enactment of the Al Brady shoot out in Bangor , Maine . At this event , he was presented with a plaque and the key to the city . At the age of 101 , he was the FBI 's oldest living former agent and was in excellent physical shape , aside from some hearing and memory loss . He credited his longevity to luck , listening to his parents and blessings from God . At the 100th anniversary celebration of the FBI , it was noted that Walsh was older than the agency itself . In March 2013 , at the age of 105 , he surpassed American gymnast Rudolf Schrader to become the longest @-@ lived Olympic competitor . He died at his home in Arlington , Virginia in April 2014 , less than a week prior to his 107th birthday . 
 = The Farm ( The Office ) = 
 " The Farm " is the seventeenth episode of the ninth season of the American comedy television series The Office and the 192nd overall . It originally aired on NBC on March 14 , 2013 . The episode guest stars Matt L. Jones as Dwight 's cousin Zeke , Majandra Delfino as Dwight 's sister Fannie , Blake Garrett as his nephew , and Thomas Middleditch as his brother . 
 The series — presented as if it were a real documentary — depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . The episode revolves around Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) and Oscar Martinez ( Oscar Nunez ) who attend the funeral of Dwight 's Aunt Shirley at Schrute Farms . Dwight receives his aunt 's property , and he and his siblings decide to run it . Meanwhile , Todd Packer ( David Koechner ) returns to the office to get back at them for his firing a year prior . 
 " The Farm " was produced to serve as a backdoor pilot for a proposed spin @-@ off series starring Wilson as Dwight , which NBC ultimately did not pick up . The episode received mostly negative reviews from television critics , with many criticizing Dwight 's farm storyline and some critics calling it a " Frankenstein episode " . The episode was viewed by 3 @.@ 54 million viewers and received a 1 @.@ 9 / 5 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 .

The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed them her estate on the condition that they all move back to run it . Unsure about whether they should take over the farm , they all discuss the pros and cons of the situation . Eventually , Dwight convinces them to help him run the farm . 
 Meanwhile , Todd Packer ( David Koechner ) visits the office and announces that he wants to make amends for his past behavior . He makes rude remarks masked as apologies and hands out store @-@ bought cupcakes . Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) argues that they should not eat the cupcakes , to spite Packer . She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves , but once Pam goes home the remaining employees eat the cupcakes . Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs , supposedly as revenge for getting him fired ( though none of the employees present save Nellie had anything to do with his being fired ) . He then visits Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) and Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) at Athlead in Philadelphia , pulling the same trick on them . In the morning , Pam returns to the office and announces she is going to eat her cupcake , only to find everyone else reeling from the aftereffects of Packer 's deed .

 = FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II = 
 The FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II ( in the indigenous language Mapuche , <unk> : Arrow ) was a jet fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank in the late 1940s in Argentina , under the Perón government , and built by the Fábrica Militar de Aviones ( FMA ) . Embodying many of the design elements of the wartime Focke @-@ Wulf Ta 183 , an unrealized fighter project , the FMA envisioned the IAe 33 Pulqui II as a successor to the postwar Gloster Meteor F4 in service with the Fuerza Aérea Argentina . The Pulqui II 's development was comparatively problematic and lengthy , with two of the four prototypes being lost in fatal crashes . Despite one of the prototypes being successfully tested in combat during the Revolución Libertadora , the political , economic and technical challenges faced by the project meant that the IAe 33 was unable to reach its full potential , and the Argentine government ultimately chose to purchase F @-@ 86 Sabres from the United States in lieu of continuing development of the indigenous fighter to production status . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the late 1940s , Argentina benefited from the recruitment of prominent German aerospace scientists and engineers , fleeing Europe following the defeat of the Nazis and seeking sanctuary in Latin America . The first group of these refugees had also included French designer Émile Dewoitine , castigated as a collaborator in his homeland , who headed the IAe 27 Pulqui I experimental fighter program with Argentine engineers Juan Ignacio San Martín , Enrique <unk> and Norberto L. <unk> . The Pulqui I was the first jet aircraft designed and built in Latin America . In 1947 , flight tests revealed a mediocre performance resulting in the cancellation of the IAe 27 program . The <unk> Institute ( Spanish : Instituto <unk> ) , under the leadership of <unk> , persevered with its efforts to build a successful indigenous jet fighter and , at first , attempted to modify the earlier aircraft . When it became apparent that the Pulqui I had little potential for further development , the <unk> Institute initiated a new design utilizing the more powerful ( 20 @.@ 31 kN ( 4 @,@ 570 lbf ) ) Rolls @-@ Royce Nene II turbojet engine . In early 1948 , the Institute completed a scale model of what it called the IAe @-@ 27a Pulqui II . This design featured trapezoidal wings , swept back at an angle of 33 ° , and used a NACA <unk> laminar flow airfoil section . A revised model was built later that year with the wings relocated to a shoulder @-@ mounted position and the tailplane changed to a T @-@ tail configuration . 
 = = = Kurt Tank = = = 
 Like Dewoitine , German designer Kurt Tank , the former technical director of the Focke @-@ Wulf Flugzeugbau AG , had been similarly hired in 1947 to work on a jet fighter project for Argentina . Tank , along with 62 of his compatriots at Focke @-@ Wulf , had emigrated to Latin America to restart his career in aerospace ventures . <unk> entering the country with a passport identifying him as Pedro Matthies , he found a warm welcome and did not maintain the subterfuge of a secret identity . Along with his former employees , he was instrumental in the evolution of the Instituto <unk> into Argentina 's military aircraft factory , the Fábrica Militar de Aviones at Córdoba . Tank was both an engineer as well as a test pilot , who had designed the Fw 190 fighter , but his design team had also been responsible for the Focke @-@ Wulf Ta 183 , an unbuilt project that had been declared the winner of the 1945 Emergency Fighter Competition . The diminutive , swept @-@ wing , jet @-@ powered Ta 183 , designed by Focke @-@ Wulf engineer / designer Hans <unk> , had only reached the stage of wind tunnel studies before the end of hostilities . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 After his appointment as project director for a new indigenous fighter program , Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine , substantially resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear . The Nene was larger , heavier and more powerful than the Heinkel <unk> 011 turbojet that had been planned for use in the Ta 183 , and therefore required a new , redesigned fuselage with a larger cross @-@ section primarily due to the Nene 's centrifugal rather than the <unk> 011 's axial compressor design . 
 Due to the similarity of the IAe @-@ 27a and Tank 's redesign of the Ta 183 , Juan Ignacio San Martín , the director of the Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II . The fuselage of Tank 's design was further adapted to use the IAe @-@ 27a 's undercarriage . The shoulder @-@ mounted , negative @-@ incidence wings were swept back 40 ° , an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183 , and given a small amount of anhedral . Comparable to the Ta 183 's engine placement , the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit , near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section . The airframe featured a graceful , 50 ° swept @-@ back T @-@ shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble @-@ type canopy , faired into the dorsal fuselage . Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated . Fuel capacity was initially 1 @,@ 250 l ( 275 Imp. gal . ) internally and 800 l ( 176 Imp. gal . ) in the wings . Armament was planned to include four 20 mm cannon , a pair mounted in a staggered , near @-@ ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake . 
 = = = Testing and evaluation = = = 
 To prove the soundness of the IAe 33 design , two gliders built under contract by another expatriate , <unk> Horten , were constructed and used for aerodynamics testing in 1948 – 1949 , including flights by Tank himself . These tests revealed significant problems with lateral stability , resulting in modifications to the tail to address this problem before construction began on two prototype airframes . Due to the lack of modern machinery , the all @-@ metal fabrication relied heavily on <unk> , and fabricating the prototypes was a labor @-@ intensive procedure . President Perón envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world @-@ class manufacturing facilities . However , Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand @-@ built examples . The first airframe ( No. 01 ) reserved for static testing , was subsequently destroyed during the tests . 
 The first of the " flying " IAe 33 prototypes , ( No. 02 ) built in 1950 , completed its maiden flight on 27 June of that year , with Captain Edmundo Weiss at the controls . On the second flight , ex @-@ Focke @-@ Wulf test pilot Otto Behrens encountered severe lateral stability problems at speeds over 700 km / h ( 435 mph ) and returned to the airfield as a precaution . Landing at very high speed , the aircraft bounced with sufficient force to cause the right main undercarriage strut to fail . During repairs to the aircraft , in order to rectify the " tricky " landing characteristics , the front undercarriage strut was increased in length , which served to alter the angle of incidence of the aircraft , while the shock absorbers were adjusted to have a greater " throw " . Although never considered docile , the modifications improved the takeoff , landing and low @-@ speed characteristics of the IAe 33 . More serious aerodynamic problems persisted , stemming from tip stall — in which the wingtip stalled before the <unk> resulting in an unpredictable " rolling moment " — leading to a change in the wing leading edge near the <unk> , while the rudder was modified in an attempt to resolve the interminable lateral instability issues . In addition , the canopy was reinforced with two external frames and a small fairing was installed above the engine exhaust . 
 Tank , himself a capable development test pilot , took over the test program to investigate the aircraft 's stalling characteristics , although the requisite airframe changes took several months to complete , with the Pulqui II N. 02 ( m ) so modified not able to undertake its third proving flight until 23 October . During the ensuing high @-@ altitude test , on two successive occasions , the IAe 33 stalled inadvertently , although Tank had sufficient height at 9 @,@ 000 m for recovery . Adding ballast to the nose of the aircraft cured the problem . On 8 February 1951 , Tank publicly demonstrated the IAe 33 before Perón at the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires . The audience also included government officials , legislators and the foreign diplomatic corps in the military attaches of the embassies , along with a large crowd of spectators . Both the IAe 27 Pulqui I and IAe 33 Pulqui II flew during the demonstration . 
 With the successful completion of the proving test flights , the Argentine Air Force requested a pre @-@ production order of 12 IAe 33 aircraft . In 1951 , the air force established a team of service pilots to test fly the new aircraft in a series of acceptance flights . The first flight by Commander Soto on 31 May 1951 revealed severe vibration at about 1 @,@ 000 kilometres per hour ( 621 mph ) . Tank declared the sole prototype unserviceable pending an investigation into the problem , although this stricture appears to have been overlooked and the prototype continued to fly . On the eve of its 28th flight , Captain <unk> <unk> , assigned to the test program , was advised not to stress the aircraft , as the source of the vibrations experienced during the previous flight in the morning had not been discovered . Determined to " better " his team leader 's recent performance , however , he ignored the precautions and began practicing aerobatic maneuvers near Córdoba during his afternoon flight . Consequently , in a high g @-@ force turn , a structural failure occurred with the wing separating from the fuselage . After struggling with the Martin @-@ Baker Mk I ejection seat , <unk> ejected at low altitude while the aircraft was inverted . His parachute did not fully deploy , however , and he was killed . The defect in the Pulqui II was traced to faulty workmanship related to welding the joint pin that fastened the wing to the fuselage . Welding had been a dichotomy in the manufacturing process necessitated by the paucity of modern forging and pressing equipment in Argentina . 
 Construction of a third prototype ( No. 03 ) began immediately after this loss . The design team initiated a number of changes to rectify design flaws found in the first " flying " prototype , including an incorporating a larger rudder to improve lateral stability , increasing the size of the exhaust fairing and adding a unique air brake that rotated out from the sides of the fuselage near the tail , along with further reinforcement of the canopy . More fuel was also carried internally to extend the range from 2 @,@ 030 to 3 @,@ 090 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 260 to 1 @,@ 920 mi ) . The new IAe 33 prototype completed its first flight on 23 September 1952 , piloted by Capt. Jorge Doyle . Flight testing resumed although the aircraft was prepared for a demonstration before President Perón on 11 October 1952 . Behrens , who was slated for the flight , had reservations about the flight characteristics of the Pulqui II at the extremes of its flight envelope , characterizing them as " ... the worst I 've ever experienced as a test pilot . " Two days prior to the exhibition , while practicing his display routine , Behrens stalled the Pulqui II at low level and was killed in the resulting crash , which destroyed the prototype . 
 In 1953 , Tank constructed a fourth prototype ( No. 04 ) and , in an attempt to resolve the design 's deep stall problems at high angles of attack , added stall fences on each wing and four strakes on the rear fuselage . Other refinements included a pressurized cockpit , additional fuel capacity and it was also the first prototype to be fitted with the definitive four 20 mm Hispano Mark V cannon armament . Lt. Conan Doyle piloted the fourth IAe 33 on its maiden flight on 20 August 1953 and , along with Lt. Gonzalez and Lt. Balado , began armament testing in 1954 . 
 While an " all @-@ weather " IAe 33 version adding a radar was considered , the Argentine Air Force made tentative plans for the acquisition of 100 Pulqui II aircraft , with the production version to be a dedicated interceptor , featuring an uprated Nene engine fitted with an afterburner and giving it an anticipated maximum speed of Mach 0 @.@ 98 . A number of foreign buyers had equally expressed interest in the IAe 33 , including the Netherlands in 1951 and Egypt in 1953 , but the lack of a clear commitment to a production series hampered prospects for export sales , with both nations eventually settling on other readily available fighter aircraft . 
 = = Political ramifications = = 
 The IAe 33 Pulqui II project was inexorably linked to the machinations and fortunes of the <unk> regime . Although the Fábrica Militar de Aviones was charged with bringing aviation projects to completion , constant political interference contributed to the delays and disarray in aviation programs . Severe economic problems led in 1951 to the Perón government using the Fábrica Militar de Aviones to build cars , trucks , and motorcycles , including the <unk> <unk> . Moreover , Tank 's team was not primarily focused on the IAe 33 , completing the design of the FMA IA 35 <unk> multi @-@ purpose aircraft ( transport , trainer and reconnaissance roles ) , that eventually entered production at the Dirección Nacional de <unk> e <unk> Aeronáutica ( <unk> ) ( Spanish : " National Directorate of Aeronautical Manufacturing and Research " ) . The most devastating political decision was to divert the entire manufacturing program " seemingly overnight " to automotive products and agricultural equipment , essentially closing the aviation divisions . The competing <unk> projects such as automotive manufacture served to further drain resources in time , money and personnel from the Pulqui II project . 
 While Argentina 's finances were extremely strained at this juncture following the economic crisis in 1953 , the most serious setback to the project came in January 1955 when Tank 's contract expired . He reputedly requested almost twice as much money to continue but President Perón instead canceled his contract outright . Despite four years of development and trials , the IAe 33 project was still encountering teething problems and its status remained unclear although no final decision had been made to abandon a project that had reached iconic stature in the <unk> era . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 In September 1955 , the sole remaining Pulqui II prototype was pressed into action in the Revolución Libertadora , a coup d 'état led by General Eduardo <unk> against Perón . The exact details of its participation are unknown , but when rebel forces commanded by <unk> captured Córdoba as their first conquest , together with the Meteor F 4s fighter @-@ bombers stationed at the Córdoba Escuela De Aviación - <unk> ( Military Aviation School ) , the IAe 33 was enlisted in the struggle . After flying combat missions against <unk> stalwarts , it later appeared in a flyover during the victory parade at Córdoba celebrating the triumph of the coup over loyalist forces . 
 When the military junta came to power , the IAe 33 project was thrown into disarray . The new government released many of the leading air force staff ; similarly , most of Tank 's team was forced to leave Argentina with Tank himself going to India , where he worked for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited , and later developed the HF @-@ 24 <unk> supersonic fighter . 
 In 1956 , the air force , in an effort to gain political support , planned a record flight from Córdoba to Buenos Aires to demonstrate the combat potential of the IAe 33 . The Pulqui II would fly 800 km , strafe an air force practice range in the Buenos Aires area , and then return to Córdoba using only internal fuel . The only oxygen equipment available for such a long flight was scrounged from a FMA Meteor under repairs . Lt. Balado successfully completed the flight ( including the strafing demonstration ) at an average cruise speed of around 900 km / h , but the oxygen system failed on the return leg . The semi @-@ conscious pilot managed to perform an emergency landing at high speed , but the heavy landing and resulting stress broke the landing gear , with the Pulqui II overrunning the end of the runway , the aircraft being damaged beyond repair . 
 = = Cancellation = = 
 Shortly after Balado 's record flight , the Argentine Air Force reviewed its decision to acquire 100 Pulqui IIs for its fighter force . The Fábrica Militar de Aviones considered that , based on the spares and wing and fuselage components at hand , ten aircraft could be constructed relatively quickly , however the remainder of the order would take five years to complete . Up to this time , the attrition of the original 100 Meteor F 4s obtained in the late 1940s continued , with plans for an alternative replacement , initially centered on the acquisition of 36 Canadair F @-@ 86 Mk 6 Sabres , being rejected in 1956 when the Central Bank of Argentina was unable to provide the necessary foreign exchange . 
 When the Canadair Sabre was no longer a viable option , the Fábrica Militar de Aviones seriously considered having the Pulqui II enter series production . A new prototype was ordered in 1957 , despite the United States having offered 100 combat @-@ proven F @-@ 86 Sabre fighters that were available immediately . The fifth IAe 33 Pulqui II ( No. 05 ) prototype , designated Pulqui IIe , was constructed in 1959 ( visually identical to the fourth prototype although retaining the original frameless , clear canopy ) and entered flight testing after its first flight on 18 September 1959 , with Lt. Roberto <unk> flying . The continual evolution of the Pulqui II had resulted in the design team solving its inherent instability at high angles of attack , as well as increasing fuel capacity through the use of a wet wing , to provide sufficient range . However the fighter was now considered obsolete , in addition to its being tainted politically by its association with Perón . Consequently , the Argentine Government decided to cancel the IAe 33 project at the zenith of its development , instead acquiring 28 F @-@ <unk> @-@ 40 Sabres from the United States at a " bargain @-@ basement price " under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act . 
 In 1960 , after completing only 12 test fights in a new role as a transonic research platform , the last IAe 33 prototype was retired and placed into storage , bringing the Pulqui II project to a culmination . The remaining factory tooling and incomplete airframes were summarily destroyed soon after . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Despite not having achieved production status , the IAe 33 Pulqui II is still considered a significant aviation achievement because it was the first swept @-@ wing jet fighter entirely developed and built in Latin America and , along with the Pulqui I , allowed Argentina to lay claim to becoming only the eighth nation in the world to develop such technology . . One tangible long @-@ term benefit that can be traced to the Pulqui II project was the creation of Argentina 's fledgling aviation industry , now restructured as the Lockheed Martin Aircraft Argentina S.A ..

 = 2002 – 03 Arsenal F.C. season = 
 The 2002 – 03 season was the 105th season of competitive football played by Arsenal . The club retained the FA Cup , a feat last achieved by Tottenham Hotspur in 1982 , but finished runners @-@ up to Manchester United in the Premier League . In the UEFA Champions League , defeat to Valencia in the second group stage meant Arsenal exited the competition at the same round for the second successive year . 
 Arsenal began the new campaign as league and cup double winners , and manager Arsène Wenger sought improvement in the Champions League , a competition the club failed in . The retirement of defender Tony Adams meant French midfielder Patrick Vieira was appointed as captain ; Pascal Cygan was signed as a replacement in defence . Other recruitments included defensive midfielders Gilberto Silva and Kolo Touré , while goalkeepers Alex Manninger and Richard Wright departed to join Espanyol and Everton respectively . 
 In the league , a 4 – 1 win against Leeds United in September meant the club broke the record for scoring in consecutive games ( 47 ) , and away league games without defeat ( 22 ) . The club began 2003 in first position , but subsequently floundered ; a draw to Aston Villa in April allowed Manchester United to move joint top . A further draw at Bolton Wanderers meant the league championship was , mathematically , out of Arsenal 's hands and defeat to Leeds a week after ended their chances of retaining the league . Consolation came in retaining the FA Cup ; a solitary goal scored by midfielder Robert Pirès was enough to beat Southampton in the 2003 final . 
 30 different players represented the club in five competitions and there were 17 different goalscorers . Arsenal 's top goalscorer was Thierry Henry , who scored 32 goals in 55 appearances . 
 = = Background = =

 Wenger hoped his team 's success would begin an era of dominating English football for years to come , citing a " shift of power " . He moreover aimed for significant improvement in the Champions League , a competition where the club failed to reach higher than the quarter @-@ finals . Such was Arsenal 's impressive form in late summer , Wenger commented that his team could go the entire season undefeated .

 Arsenal began the season with a 2 – 0 home victory against promoted Birmingham City ; goals from Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord extended the club 's winning run to fourteen matches – a new top @-@ flight record . A late equaliser by Wiltord in their next match at West Ham United earned Arsenal a point , having trailed 2 – 0 in the first half . Three days later , a 5 – 2 win against West Bromwich Albion moved Arsenal to the top of the league table . Although they drew to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge , having lost captain Vieira through a sending @-@ off , a win against Manchester City meant Arsenal leapfrogged local rivals Tottenham Hotspur to first position . A 3 – 0 win at Charlton Athletic on 15 September 2002 pleased Wenger , who indicated after the match the league was theirs to lose : " We know we can win the league . We know we can be stronger . At this stage last season we were not as good as we are now . " Striker Kanu scored a stoppage time winner against Bolton Wanderers to win their eleventh successive home game .

 Arsenal started October with a 3 – 1 win against Sunderland , breaking Manchester United 's Premier League record of 30 matches unbeaten . They however suffered their first defeat of the season , against Everton ; teenager Wayne Rooney scored from long range in the last minute of the match .

 A Steve <unk> own goal gave Arsenal a much @-@ needed 1 – 0 win against Fulham , ceasing their run of four defeats on 3 November 2002 . Another 1 – 0 win , this time against Newcastle United moved Arsenal one point behind leaders Liverpool . Vieira 's performance in particular was <unk> in The Guardian as a " demonstration of tackling , control , awareness and movement that was exceptional even by his standards . " In the North London derby on 16 November 2002 , Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotpsur 3 – 0 to go back at the top of the league table . The opening goal , scored by Henry was later voted the Goal of the Season by viewers of ITV 's The Premiership , having picked up the ball from Arsenal 's side of the pitch and running past the opposition defence to shoot past goalkeeper Kasey Keller .

Manchester United opened the scoring in the 21st minute – a poor clearance by Cygan allowed Juan Sebastián Verón to score . Arsenal goalkeeper Rami Shaaban was substituted before the start of the second half , having pulled a thigh muscle . He was replaced by Stuart Taylor , who was helpless to prevent Paul Scholes from scoring a second goal , 15 minutes before the final whistle . A 1 – 1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur was followed by a win against Middlesbrough ; a goal apiece from Campbell and Pirès meant Arsenal were top of the table on Christmas . On Boxing Day , Arsenal came from a goal down to beat West Brom 2 – 1 ; in doing so , they extended their lead at the top to four points . Three days later , Arsenal 's lead was increased to five points , having drawn with Liverpool . 
 In spite of conceding two late goals against Chelsea , Arsenal won by a solitary goal on New Year 's Day to maintain their lead . Two goals from Henry against Birmingham City took his total for the club to 100 goals in all competitions ; Wenger declared the display – a 4 – 0 win , as his team 's best since beating Leeds United in September . Henry scored a hat @-@ trick for Arsenal against West Ham United on 19 January 2003 but the team drew at Liverpool in spite of a polished performance ; Emile Heskey <unk> the ball into the net , scoring for the home team after 90 minutes . On 1 February 2003 , Pirès scored a late goal against Fulham , extending Arsenal 's lead to six points at the top .

He kicked the ball against Laurent – I 've seen other players do that and I don 't like it . " Arsenal beat Manchester City 5 – 1 in their final trip to Maine Road on 22 February 2003 . The first four goals , all scored before the half @-@ hour , came at a time when " [ Alex ] Ferguson ordered the radio to be switched before they reached Old Trafford , presumably in ghastly silence . "

 On 2 March 2003 , Arsenal opened up an eight @-@ point lead at the top of the table , winning 2 – 0 against Charlton Athletic . The result was enough for Irish bookmaker Paddy Power to pay out on punters backing Arsenal to retain their lead , despite Manchester United having a game in hand . The gap was cut to two points after Arsenal suffered their first defeat in 2003 , against Blackburn Rovers . By the time Arsenal played Everton on 23 March 2003 , they were displaced at the top of the table by Manchester United . A goal by Vieira moved the team two points clear once more . 
 An own goal scored by Touré meant Fredrik Ljungberg 's opener against Aston Villa was cancelled out and the match ended in a draw , albeit helping Arsenal back to first position on goal difference . Leading up to the potential championship decider against Manchester United on 16 April 2003 , Wenger was adamant his team were mentally ready to retain the title : " We want to be a team who makes history . That 's what 's really driving us on . We are not worrying about United too much . We are just concentrating on expressing our togetherness , our mental strength and our qualities . We have enough players who can win this game . " Having conceded a first half goal scored by Ruud van Nistelrooy , Arsenal overturned Manchester United 's lead before Ryan Giggs equalised for the away team . The match ended 2 – 2 ; Campbell was sent off for elbowing Ole Gunnar Solskjær and was banned the rest of the season , whereas Vieira limped off with an injury . Although the result helped Manchester United move back top , they had played one game more than Arsenal . Arsenal won their next match at Middlesbrough , but squandered a two @-@ goal lead away to Bolton Wanderers in the last ten minutes . The result , " a big blow " for Arsenal 's title hopes , meant the championship was now in Manchester United 's favour . 
 With Manchester United beating Charlton Athletic 4 – 1 on 3 May 2003 , Arsenal , a day later , needed a win against Leeds United to restore any hope of finishing top of the league . In a five @-@ goal match , an 88th @-@ minute goal by Mark Viduka ensured Leeds United 's survival in the top division and Manchester United 's recapture of the Premiership . Wenger revoked suggestion that the league campaign was a " failure " , arguing his team were consistent : 
 Of course we want to win the league but I think the most difficult thing for the club is to be consistent and we have been remarkably consistent . We are in the cup final ; we lose the league to a team who spends 50 % more money every year – last year they bought a player for £ 30m pounds when they lost the championship . They will do the same next year and we [ have ] done miracles just to fight with them . 
 Arsenal won their final two matches of the league season , against Southampton – where Pirès and Jermaine Pennant both scored a hat @-@ trick – and Sunderland , ending the season with 78 points .

" In the sixth round , Arsenal were drawn at home to Chelsea in a repeat of the previous season 's final . Chelsea defender John Terry put his team ahead with a header from a set piece before Arsenal responded through Jeffers and Henry . Frank Lampard scored a late equaliser for the visiting team meaning the match was replayed at Stamford Bridge . An own goal by Terry and a strike by Wiltord in the space of seven minutes during the replay gave Arsenal an early lead against Chelsea . Despite going down to ten men after Cygan was sent off and Terry scoring from a header , the away team scored a third goal through Lauren to ensure progression into the semi @-@ finals . In the semi @-@ final against Sheffield United on 13 April 2003 at Old Trafford , Ljungberg scored the winning goal to help Arsenal reach their third successive FA Cup final appearance . The match was remembered for Seaman , who on his 1,000th appearance in senior football produced a late save to deny Sheffield United from equalising . 
 In the 2003 FA Cup Final against Southampton , a goal from Pirès , scored in the first half was enough to ensure Arsenal won their ninth FA Cup , becoming the first team to retain the trophy in over 20 years . Wenger commented after the game that his team " got the trophy we wanted " while defender Martin Keown said the FA Cup win was " the best ever " . Winning captain David Seaman felt the disappointment of losing out to Manchester United in the league spurred the team on .

 Flavas is an American line of fashion dolls created by Mattel in 2003 .

They were designed to appeal to tweens ( 8- to 12 @-@ year @-@ olds ) and compete with the widely successful Bratz dolls . They were marketed as " reality @-@ based " and " authentic " and have more points of articulation than traditional fashion dolls for more expressive posing . Flavas were criticized for being stereotypical , bad role models , and a misrepresentation of hip hop culture . Their multiculturalism was described as positive , and British analysts expected their " risqué nature " to translate to high sales . But following sales that were described as " disastrous " they were discontinued within a year .

 The six Flavas dolls , <unk> Brown , Happy D , Tika , Liam , P. Bo , and Tre , are ethnically diverse and portray Hispanic , black and white people . They have an urban sensibility and are dressed in hip hop fashions . Their accessories include ghetto blasters , cell phones , " bling @-@ bling " jewellery and stick @-@ on tattoos . The packaging , which doubles as a doll stand , is designed as a wall painted with graffiti . Instructions on the box say : " Pull my street stand from the box , so I have a spot to hang out . " Newsweek described them as " edgy " and " ghetto @-@ fabulous " . Marketed with a focus on self @-@ expression and individuality , the Flavas dolls have more points of articulation than traditional fashion dolls . This allows for a wider range of posing and , according to Mattel , to express more " attitude " . Each doll has a unique face sculpt and a different height , ranging from 10 inches to 11 @.@ 5 inches . They were each released in two different styles and each style was packaged with two different outfits . The complex jointing and individual molds made the Flavas dolls more difficult to manufacture than most other fashion dolls .
