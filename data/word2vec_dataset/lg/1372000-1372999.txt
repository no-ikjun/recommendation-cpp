 The mintages are in many cases not a true indication of relative rarity . Coins remaining in bank vaults in the United States were melted after 1933 ; coins in bank vaults overseas were not . Millions of double eagles , of both the Liberty Head and Saint @-@ Gaudens designs , were repatriated for numismatic and investment purposes once it was legal to do so .

 Arthur Chu ( born January 30 , 1984 ) is an American columnist and former game show contestant . He is known for the unusual style of play he adopted during his 11 @-@ game winning streak on the syndicated US game show Jeopardy ! . When the shows aired , Chu attracted criticism from many for jumping from category to category rather than selecting clues in sequential order , a strategy known as the " Forrest Bounce " , after former champion Chuck Forrest . 
 Chu prepared extensively before his Jeopardy ! appearance by reviewing tapes , study guides , game theory and Jeopardy ! strategy . He made his debut on the January 28 , 2014 , winning $ 37 @,@ 000 in his first game . After winning 11 games , he lost his 12th game ( which aired on March 12 , 2014 ) to Diana <unk> .

 Chu made his debut as a contestant on the January 28 , 2014 , episode of Jeopardy ! , winning $ 37 @,@ 000 in his first game . On the January 29 episode , Chu made a Final Jeopardy ! wager that caused him to tie fellow contestant Carolyn Collins . Chu claimed that he made the decision to wager for a tie not out of kindness but because of the advice of 2003 College champion Keith Williams , who claims that game theory favors wagering for a tie over the more common practice of wagering to win by a dollar . Chu defeated Collins on the January 30 episode . 
 After a three @-@ week airtime break , he became eligible for the Tournament of Champions on February 24 when he won for the fifth time ; his total winnings were $ 123 @,@ 600 .

 Throughout Chu 's 11 @-@ game streak , his aggressive style of play attracted criticism among fans of the series , some of whom considered his conduct to be unsportsmanlike and against the spirit of Jeopardy ! His strategy earned him the nickname the " Jeopardy ! Villain " , a nickname Chu fully embraced . One of the most common complaints about his playing style was that he jumped from category to category , a strategy known as the " Forrest Bounce " , after former champion Chuck Forrest . The Forrest Bounce is a common strategy , however , employed by several successful past champions , including Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter , who , like Chu , used it to increase their odds of finding Daily Doubles first . Inspired by Watson , a computer that was programmed to play Jeopardy ! , Chu picked high @-@ value clues first , because they are more likely to be Daily Doubles . In his second game , Chu wagered $ 5 on a Daily Double and responded " I don 't know " immediately after the clue was given . 
 Chu also held the buzzer close to the microphone , resulting in audible clicks when signaling , and upon correctly answering a question , rushed quickly to the next clue . This gamesmanship , the resulting criticism and his engagement with critics on Twitter during airings of his shows led some to declare his run akin to a " Moneyball " moment , and Chu himself " ruthless " and " idol @-@ killingly pragmatic " . 
 In response , both Trebek and Jennings have defended Chu as a " good player " who makes the game " more exciting " .

 After his appearance on Jeopardy ! , Chu contacted publicists and PR firms to ask for suggestions on how to monetize the recognition from his Jeopardy ! run .

Instead , he started writing a column for The Daily Beast , and later for Salon . Chu has written on various aspects of nerd culture and on being Asian American .

 = New Bedford Historic District = 
 The New Bedford Historic District is a National Historic Landmark District in New Bedford , Massachusetts , United States , west of the community 's waterfront . During the 19th century , when the city was the center of the American whaling industry , this was its downtown . After its decline in the early and mid @-@ 20th century , through the efforts of local activist groups the district has since been preserved and restored to appear much as it was during that period . 
 Most of its buildings were erected between 1790 and 1855 by Russell Warren and other builders working in the Federal and Greek Revival architectural styles . Many of them reflect the legacy of whaling in the city 's development . The district was designated a National Historic Landmark ( NHL ) and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 . Later it was recognized as a local historic district and protected by local zoning . One building within it , the U.S. Customhouse , is the oldest such facility currently in use and has been independently recognized as an NHL . Since 1996 the district has also been a part of New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The district is bounded by Front Street on the east , Elm Street on the north , Acushnet Avenue and the Central New Bedford Historic District on the west , and Commercial Street on the south . This area includes 11 city blocks and part of a twelfth . On these 19 @.@ 6 acres ( 7 @.@ 9 ha ) are 20 buildings , mostly historic but with some modern intrusions , mainly parking lots , a gas station and newer additions to the New Bedford Whaling Museum . <unk> paving and gas lamps have been added since the historic district was designated , in order to recreate the neighborhood 's 19th @-@ century appearance . The majority of the buildings are commercial in design and use , but there are some houses , and some mixed @-@ use structures . 
 Just east of the district is the John F. Kennedy Expressway ( MA 18 ) , a limited @-@ access highway which has become a barrier between the district and the neighboring waterfront , is still in use . Local preservationists have supported a plan to redesign the highway and restore access to the waterfront that spurred the area 's original development . The city received a $ 16 @.@ 3 million grant to make this possible . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Rise as whaling center = = = 
 New Bedford 's potential as a whaling port was seen by Joseph Rotch , who moved to the recently settled area in 1765 . He and Joseph Russell , a local landowner who is generally regarded as the city 's founder , saw that it had a deep harbor that could receive seagoing vessels at docks . Nantucket , then the center of the American whaling industry , did not . Rotch and Russell attracted shipbuilders to the area , and soon one of their ships , the Dartmouth , sailed from the city 's docks . In 1767 , it carried the first load of New Bedford whale oil to London . By the time of the Revolution , there were 50 ships in the local fleet . 
 In 1778 , the British Army burned the city in retaliation for the acts of local privateers . The fire destroyed 34 ships , 76 shops , 26 storehouses and 11 homes . After independence , the city concentrated on rebuilding its major industry , and in 1791 , the Rebecca set sail , becoming the first American whaler to harvest oil from the Pacific . Two decades later , the War of 1812 again took a toll on the industry , which recovered again and by 1823 , New Bedford 's fleet equalled Nantucket 's in tonnage . Four years later the city 's whaling industry had surpassed the island 's in barrels produced . 
 As the city prospered in the following years , much of the historic district was built . In the 1830s , Robert Mills designed the U.S. Customhouse , where whaling captains filed necessary paperwork and paid their tariffs and duties . Joseph Rotch 's grandson William , by then a wealthy man , built his mansion , now the Rotch @-@ Jones @-@ Duff House and Garden Museum , further inland . The Seamen 's Bethel , built in 1832 , became the traditional spot for sailors ' religious services before departing for the deep oceans , such as the one described in Herman Melville 's classic 1851 novel Moby @-@ Dick , which begins in New Bedford . 
 By 1840 , New Bedford , connected to the growing railroad network , had displaced Nantucket as the country 's top whaling port . The streets grew busier and the houses grander . Early in Moby @-@ Dick , Melville , who had lived there a decade earlier , describes the city at the height of its prosperity : 
 But think not that this famous town has only <unk> , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors . Not at all . Still New Bedford is a queer place . Had it not been for us <unk> , that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador . As it is , parts of her back country are enough to frighten one , they look so bony . The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in , in all New England . It is a land of oil , true enough : but not like Canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine . The streets do not run with milk ; nor in the spring @-@ time do they pave them with fresh eggs . Yet , in spite of this , nowhere in all America will you find more patrician @-@ like houses ; parks and gardens more opulent , than in New Bedford . Whence came they ? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country ? ... Go and gaze upon the iron <unk> harpoons round yonder lofty mansion , and your question will be answered . Yes ; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans . One and all , they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea . Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that ? 
 In New Bedford , fathers , they say , give whales for <unk> to their daughters , and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a @-@ piece . You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding ; for , they say , they have reservoirs of oil in every house , and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles . 
 In summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine maples — long avenues of green and gold . And in August , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse @-@ chestnuts , candelabra @-@ wise , proffer the passer @-@ by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms . So omnipotent is art ; which in many a district of New Bedford has <unk> bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation ’ s final day . 
 The New Bedford Institute for Savings ( NBIS ) , now used as the National Park Service 's visitors ' center , was built in 1853 . 
 = = = Decline and historic preservation era = = = 
 The whaling industry peaked in 1857 , when New Bedford accounted for half the U.S. fleet . Growing competition from the new petroleum industry , and the impact of the Civil War , ensured that it would not recover as it had in the past . The Bethel was rebuilt after an 1867 fire , with a new exterior and an added tower . The NBIS building became a local courthouse , and the center of commercial activity in New Bedford moved west , where it has remained , as textiles became the city 's dominant industry . The whaling museum was established in one of the old buildings in 1907 . But ships lost at sea were not replaced as they had been before , and in 1927 , the John R. Mantra made the last whaling voyage from the city and the last in American history . 
 Some of the old whaling buildings were torn down to make way for new construction in the 20th century , or deteriorated . But the customs house remained in use , as did many of the buildings in its neighborhood . In the mid @-@ 1950s director John Huston came to town with Gregory Peck to film a scene from his adaptation of Moby @-@ Dick in front of the Seamen 's Bethel . Although it was the only scene in the film actually shot in the city , it sparked a resurgence of tourist interest when it was released . 
 Citizens of New Bedford became interested in preserving and protecting the remnants of the city 's whaling past . They formed the Waterfront Historic Area League ( WHALE ) in 1962 . In 1966 , the waterfront area was among the earliest National Historic Landmarks designated by the Secretary of the Interior . Five years later , in 1971 , WHALE succeeded in getting today 's historic district designated as the Bedford Landing Waterfront Historic District . The city later enacted zoning regulations to preserve its character . 
 Thirty years later , Congress passed legislation creating New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park , commemorating the city 's past . It included the entire historic district within its boundaries , and the park service chose the old NBIS building as its visitors ' center . In 2008 , WHALE turned over the neighboring Corson Building , built 1875 @-@ 84 , to the Park Service , which it had renovated after a 1997 fire . Plans call for it to be used for educational purposes related to the park , with a 60 @-@ seat theater , archival space , seminar room , and similar features .

 Several of the district 's properties are notable . Two have been added to the National Register in their own right , and one has further been designated a National Historic Landmark . 
 Mariner 's Home . The oldest building in the district , this Federal style stone structure dates to 1790 . It was originally built as William Rotch 's home , and moved to its present location from William and North Water streets . 
 Samuel Rodman <unk> . This stone ( later stucco ) structure dates to 1810 . One of the oldest commercial buildings in the district .

 = Sibu by @-@ election , 2010 = 
 The Sibu by @-@ election , 2010 was a by @-@ election for the seat of Sibu in the Parliament of Malaysia . The Sarawak @-@ based seat fell vacant after the death of its incumbent member , Robert Lau Hoi Chew , from liver cancer on 9 April 2010 . The seat was defended for the Barisan Nasional coalition government by Robert Lau Hui Yew of the Sarawak United Peoples ' Party ( SUPP ) , while Sarawak State Assemblyman Wong Ho Leng contested the poll for the Democratic Action Party ( DAP ) in the Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition . Wong won the election by 398 votes , wresting the seat from the Barisan Nasional . 
 At the time of the election there were 54 @,@ 695 registered voters , a majority of whom were ethnic Chinese . In the previous general election in 2008 , the incumbent , Hoi Chew retained the seat with a 3 @,@ 235 @-@ vote majority against Wong Ho Leng , and Lim Chin Chuang of the People 's Justice Party . The Sibu seat had been last won by the DAP in 1982 , but had since been won continuously by the SUPP . 
 In this election , known as the " Battle of the Mighty Rejang " , the government and opposition went head @-@ to @-@ head on a number of local issues concerning Sarawak , including poverty , education and development . 
 = = Background and history = = 
 The Sibu constituency has been dominated by the contest between the SUPP and the DAP for approximately three decades . The DAP won the seat in the 1982 general election when Ling Sie Ming defeated Wong Soon Kai by 141 votes , causing Sibu to become the first DAP @-@ held parliamentary seat in Sarawak . The DAP lost the seat in the 1986 election to the Barisan Nasional , and in the 1990 election won the seat through Robert Lau Hoi Chew . Lau held the seat until his death from liver cancer on 9 April 2010 . His winning margin in the 2008 election had been 3 @,@ 235 votes . 
 Despite Lau 's dominance of the federal seat from 1990 , the SUPP were shocked in the 1996 state election when two of its State Assembly seats within Sibu town — Pelawan and Bukit Assek — fell to the DAP . The Bukit Assek loss saw the defeat of its president and the then Deputy Chief Minister of Sarawak , Wong Soon Kai . The defeat spelled the end of Wong 's political career and the election of the DAP 's Wong Ho Leng to the Sarawak State Assembly . Wong Ho Leng subsequently lost the Bukit Assek seat in the 2001 state election , but regained it in 2006 . 
 At the time of the by @-@ election , 66 @.@ 7 % of the seat 's 54 @,@ 695 registered voters were ethnic Chinese ; the rest of the population being Malays or indigenous Sarawakians . Christians make up 53 per cent of the electorate while the rest include Muslims , Buddhists and other religions . The seat was largely urban . 
 = = Nomination of candidates = = 
 The by @-@ election was triggered by the death of Sibu 's incumbent Member of Parliament , Robert Lau Hoi Chew on 9 April 2010 . The Election Commission subsequently set down the by @-@ election for 16 May 2010 , with candidate nominations to occur on 8 May . Within a few days , the Sibu branch of SUPP recommended Robert Lau Hui Yew to contest the by @-@ election for the governing Barisan Nasional coalition . Hui Yew was the second cousin of Hoi Chew and the son of Lau Swee <unk> , chairman of the <unk> Group of companies . On 14 April , the opposition has decided that a DAP candidate should contest the by @-@ election . Opposition Leader and People 's Justice Party ( PKR ) adviser Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim scheduled a visit to Sibu on 18 April . On the same day , Sarawak Pakatan Rakyat was formed as an opposition coalition composed of the DAP , PKR , and the Pan @-@ Malaysian Islamic Party ( PAS ) — all members of the national Pakatan Rakyat coalition — and the local Sarawak National Party . The Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia , Tan Sri <unk> Yassin visited Sibu on 19 April , expressing confidence that the voters were leaning towards supporting Barisan Nasional . 
 While SUPP 's candidate was confirmed only a few days after Hoi Chew 's death , the DAP delayed announcing its candidate until 27 April . SUPP alleged the delay was due to a split in the DAP ; however , the DAP insisted the delay was a calculated political strategy . On 27 April , the Sarawak Pakatan Rakyat announced Wong Ho Leng , state chairman of the DAP and State Assemblyman for Bukit Assek , as its candidate . Wong had earlier indicated his reluctance to stand in the by @-@ election , suggesting that the party consider the opportunity to field a younger candidate . 
 Robert Lau Hui Yew and Wong Ho Leng were joined by an independent candidate , Narawi <unk> . A businessman and former member of the Army , Narawi had been a candidate for the seat in the 1995 election . Narawi 's campaign was dismissed by the SUPP as inconsequential , while the DAP admitted that a potential split of votes between the DAP and Narawi could hurt its chances . 
 = = Election campaign issues = = 
 The by @-@ election was widely known as the " Battle of the Mighty Rejang " and was seen as a litmus test for the popularity of the opposition Pakatan Rakyat and governing Barisan Nasional coalitions on a including land rights , poverty , native displacement and unemployment in Sarawak . 
 One of the main issues during the election was the ban of the use of the word ' Allah ' in Christian publications . However , the Sarawak police has banned political parties from using the issue during campaigning in the by @-@ election as it was deemed to be a sensitive issue . Sarawak 's Officer in Charge of Criminal Investigations , <unk> Mohamed , threatened to prosecute offenders of the ban under the Sedition Act or the Internal Security Act ( ISA ) . 
 = = = Barisan Nasional = = = 
 The Barisan Nasional did not initially release a policy manifesto for the by @-@ election , but sought support on the basis of its claim to have caused Sibu 's economic growth and development . Nevertheless , late in the campaign , the BN @-@ SUPP candidate , Robert Lau Hui Yew , himself released a manifesto in which , according to <unk> , he mentioned that he would prioritise " getting more investment , job creation , skills training for single parents to increase their income , install more CCTVs in town to improve security and reduce street crimes rates as well as to transform Sibu into a ' wireless ' township . " 
 During the campaign period , Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak had distributed <unk> million to 60 Chinese aided primary schools , five independent Chinese secondary schools and two missionary schools in Sibu . Najib said that the Barisan Nasional government would continue to do more for Chinese education in the country , saying that " the Barisan government is a true friend of Chinese education , " when addressing more than 3 @,@ 000 Chinese <unk> . Besides that , some 246 families living in an under @-@ developed region in Sungai Igan within the constituency had received a total of <unk> as a one @-@ off allocation from the Federal Government . Four Methodist churches in town had been given special grants totalling <unk> million from the BN federal government in the final hours of the by @-@ election campaign . 
 The SUPP attacked the DAP on the basis of its coalition with the Islamist PAS , arguing that “ A vote for Rocket is a vote for Islamic State " . Lim Kit Siang , the parliamentary leader of the DAP , said that the issue was a “ killer weapon ” which could “ finish off ” the chances of DAP 's candidate winning by frightening off the Chinese and non @-@ Muslim voters in Sibu as it did during the 1999 Malaysian General Election where both <unk> Singh and Lim himself lost their parliamentary seats . The SUPP also claimed that if the DAP was to be voted in <unk> noodles could no longer be sold as they were mixed with pork lard ; a reference to PAS 's policy to establish Malaysia as an Islamic state . 
 Abdul Taib Mahmud , the BN chief minister of Sarawak , revised new land renewal rates which took effect on June 1 . He said that the Sarawak new land rates is the cheapest in Malaysia as compared to other states . In accordance with opposition proposal for the unconditioned , automatic renewal of land leases , he also challenged the opposition @-@ led state governments to announce new land rates lower than the current one announced by himself , without risking the income of the state governments . 
 Najib Tun Razak , the Prime Minister and leader of BN , promised voters in Rejang Park , a DAP stronghold , 5 million ringgit to alleviate floods if SUPP ’ s Robert Lau Hui Yew won the seat , stating at an election appearance : " Do we have a deal or not ? We do ! You want the <unk> million , I want Robert Lau to win . ” 
 = = = Democratic Action Party = = = 
 The DAP set out a seven @-@ point manifesto with the theme “ Sibu <unk> <unk> ” or “ <unk> ” for the by @-@ election campaign and on the top of it is solving the town ’ s flood woes in two years when the party and its coalition becomes the government at the federal and state levels . Another point in the manifesto stated that DAP would provide all Sarawakians aged above 60 a minimum of <unk> per annum as a gift for their contributions to the state . A minimum wage of <unk> per month for workers in the peninsula and <unk> for workers in Sarawak will be introduced and on education , DAP promised that all schools would be given allocations according to their needs as practised in Penang , Selangor and Kelantan . The three other points in the manifesto concerned oil royalty , land reform , and competency , accountability and transparency in governance . 
 The DAP also focused on landholding issues . Chong Chieng Jen , the director of the DAP 's by @-@ election campaign , pointed out that those who decided not to renew their 60 @-@ year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation , and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed , landholders would have to pay large premiums . Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the automatic and unconditional renewal of all leased land for a period of 99 years . 
 On the ban of using the " Allah " issue during campaigns , the DAP had gone against it and had gone ahead with the issue in its campaign . Wong Ho Leng , the DAP election candidate , said that the facts must be made known to the public . Wong also promised that if elected , he would call upon the Prime Minister and Home Minister to immediately cease the legal dispute with the Christian churches over these matters to protect the freedom of religion in Malaysia for non @-@ Muslims . The DAP has also challenge candidate Robert Lau to make his stand about the ban on non @-@ Muslims using the word “ Allah ” with DAP MP Teresa Kok stating that " If Robert Lau intends to be a Member of Parliament that speaks up for a Christian @-@ majority constituency , Sibu , then he has the moral duty to declare his stand on this thorny issue , so that the voters in Sibu can decide whether they can count on him to speak up on this issue , " Another issue that was brought up during the by @-@ election was the decision of the Home Ministry to destroy the 5 @,@ 000 copies of Indonesian Bibles confiscated . 
 On SUPP 's questioning DAP ’ s association with PAS despite having different ideology , the DAP defended itself by stating that PAS has been steadfast in the rights to freedom of religion of non @-@ Muslims and this can be seen through PAS being able to declare that there is absolutely nothing in the Quran which forbids the use of the term " Allah " in Christian publications . 
 The DAP sought to pressure Robert Lau Hui Yew over the government 's proposed Goods and Services Tax , arguing that the tax would increase prices for consumers in one of Malaysia 's poorest states . The DAP , through its leader Lim Kit Siang also pressured Hui Yew to speak up against the government 's education policy , claiming that Hui Yew 's choice to have his children educated overseas demonstrated his lack of confidence in Malaysian education . On education , the DAP also criticised SUPP 's involvement in the sale of the Laila Taib College , previously known as United College Sarawak , to the <unk> Sarawak ( Sarawak Foundation ) for the price of one ringgit , when the local Chinese population had donated money to fund the college 's building .

 The election was won by Wong Ho Leng by a margin of 398 votes over Robert Lau Hui Yew . The result was seen as a surprise win for the DAP and the opposition , as it ended a run of by @-@ election defeats for the Pakatan Rakyat parties and boosted the DAP ahead of the state elections due to be held in Sarawak in 2011 .

 The announcement of the result was marred by a two @-@ hour @-@ long delay because of arguments over the discrepancies of the postal votes by Pakatan Rakyat election agents . Of the 2 @,@ 827 ballot papers issued for postal votes , BN won 2 @,@ 323 votes ( 82 @.@ 2 % ) , DAP won 70 ( 2 @.@ 4 % ) , the independent won 36 ( 1 @.@ 2 % ) while 208 ( 7 @.@ 3 % ) were considered spoilt . 
 Pahang PKR secretariat director Zaidi Ahmad , who was appointed by the party as the team leader in charge of monitoring the postal votes during the polls , mentioned that the DAP would not have won if the 208 postal votes were not declared spoilt and the 170 ballot papers for what he claimed were “ phantom postal voters ” were returned and added to the tally . 
 Zaidi had claimed that the forms state the names , identification numbers and information about the voters and are supposed to be signed by the voters themselves as well as their witnesses . However , the election agents noticed that the same witness would sign differently on different forms . On some forms , the voters themselves did not even sign them . Zaidi concluded by saying that it meant that others had signed on their behalf . He added that only after persistent complaints from the PR ’ s election agents , Election Commission officials agreed to consider 208 ballot papers from the postal votes as spoilt votes . He also said that they have found at least between 700 and 800 more postal votes that had discrepancies but the EC disallowed these from being considered as spoilt . Zaidi finally claimed that if the by @-@ election had truly been run properly , DAP could have won with a much bigger majority as if at least 700 more postal votes were rejected as spoilt , DAP could have won the polls with a majority of a little over 1 @,@ 000 . 
 As a result , the Election Commission would review the postal voting system where EC chairman Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof said they would study the proposal to call for an early voting session for army personnel , policemen and EC staff instead of posting votes . Nevertheless , the Youth wing of PAS have demanded for the postal votes to be abolished altogether as it claims that the postal votes are no longer relevant and is prone to abuse and exploitation by the government to their benefit .

 With the win of the DAP 's candidate , there were various responses from the community . While there is fear by the local Chinese community leaders that BN 's defeat in Sibu would affect the town 's growth , others like the opposition take it as a good omen as BN can no longer take Sarawak as its " fixed @-@ deposit " in terms of parliamentary seats and neglect the state 's development . Chua Soi Lek of the Malaysian Chinese Association , a member of the BN , said that the government could no longer hide from the fact that there were issues plaguing the Chinese community and that it can no longer be swept under the carpet following the losing of Chinese @-@ majority polling centres in the by @-@ election . 
 Lim Kit Siang of the DAP mentioned that the party 's win in Sibu renews Pakatan Rakyat 's Putrajaya dream , referring to PR 's ambition to form the Federal government in the next 13th general election . However , political scientists mentioned that PR would have a tough time getting support from rural areas , referring to the DAP 's dismal performance in rural polling centres . Nevertheless , encouraged by the strong support from the urban Chinese community in the Sibu by @-@ election , DAP is now aiming to win the four other Chinese @-@ majority parliamentary seats ( namely the Sarikei , Miri , Stampin and Lanang seats ) and seven other State constituencies held by SUPP in Sarawak . 
 Abdul Taib Mahmud , the BN Chief Minister of Sarawak , said that the BN lost mainly due to the influx of PR campaigners from Peninsular Malaysia . Abang Johari Openg , Sarawak state Minister for Housing and Urban Development , blamed the " provocative tactics " allegedly employed by Pakatan Rakyat leaders for causing the defeat of the SUPP candidate , referring to the raising of the ‘ Allah ’ issue . President of Parti Rakyat Sarawak ( a component party of BN in Sarawak ) and state Minister of Land Development James <unk> had warned Peninsular Malaysia @-@ based opposition parties to refrain from practising " rowdy " politics in Sarawak saying that it might break down social order in the country , citing the May 13 incident where a racial riot occurred when BN lost its two @-@ third supermajority in parliament during the Malaysian general election , 1969 . 
 As for the SUPP , its president George Chan Hong Nam who congratulated its winning candidate Wong immediately after the election result was announced , said that his party was completely overwhelmed by DAP 's <unk> style of politics and said , " these outsiders with their street culture have come to spoil the good nature of Sarawakians , " and that " SUPP would do all it could to ensure that the " outsiders " do not gain a foothold here " . Wong Soon Koh , the SUPP state assemblyman for the Bawang Assan state seat within Sibu and a minister in the Sarawak state cabinet , claimed that the DAP was now extremely rich and could fly over campaigners from Peninsula Malaysia to Sibu for the by @-@ election . Soon Koh 's remarks came under fire by Chong Chieng Jen of the DAP where he defended the party by saying that nearly all DAP campaigners including Members of Parliament , state assemblymen or ordinary members , took care of their own expenses and stayed either with party members in Sibu or in low @-@ budget hotels to save expenses . Chong also said that unlike BN leaders , they do not fly first class , nor stay at five @-@ star hotels which are paid for by the federal or state government under the pretext of carrying out their government duties while on the other hand obviously campaigning for the SUPP candidate . 
 Ibrahim Ali , the president of Malay rights group Perkasa labelled the Chinese in Sibu as ungrateful for not voting for the BN . He claimed that the Chinese in Sibu had not appreciated the development projects and financial allocations offered by BN while the Bumiputera had to endure and compromise with the wish of Chinese community . His statement however , was met with strong opposition from the local community , including the Bumiputera community , and he was dubbed as ' ignoramus ' upon his statement . 
 Nevertheless , the losing candidate , Lau Hui Yew , pledged that he will continue to serve the people as a councilor of Sibu Municipal Council ( SMC ) and as a party leader . On the other hand , <unk> Yassin , the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia and BN 's campaign director in Sibu , said that the BN will keep all promises and commitments made during the by @-@ election even though the party lost the by @-@ election . 
 = Silverthrone Caldera = 
 The Silverthrone Caldera is a potentially active caldera complex in southwestern British Columbia , Canada , located over 350 kilometres ( 220 mi ) northwest of the city of Vancouver and about 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) west of Mount Waddington in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains . The caldera is one of the largest of the few calderas in western Canada , measuring about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) long ( north @-@ south ) and 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) wide ( east @-@ west ) . Mount Silverthrone , an eroded lava dome on the caldera 's northern flank that is 2 @,@ 864 metres ( 9 @,@ 396 ft ) high may be the highest volcano in Canada . 
 The main glaciers in the Silverthrone area are the Pashleth , <unk> , Trudel , Klinaklini and Silverthrone glaciers . Most of the caldera lies in the Ha @-@ <unk> Icefield , which is the largest icefield in the southern half of the Coast Mountains ; it is one of the five icefields in southwestern British Columbia that thinned between the mid @-@ 1980s and 1999 due to global warming . Nearly half of the icefield is drained by the Klinaklini Glacier , which feeds the Klinaklini River . 
 The Silverthrone Caldera is very remote and rarely visited or studied by geoscientists , such as volcanologists . It can be reached by helicopter or — with major difficulty — by hiking along one of the several river valleys extending from the British Columbia Coast or from the Interior Plateau . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Silverthrone is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt , which is circumscribed by a group of <unk> intrusions . At another deeply eroded caldera complex called Franklin Glacier Volcano , the Pemberton Volcanic Belt merges with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt , a northwest @-@ trending belt of volcanic cones and fields extending from near the Canada – United States border east of Vancouver on the British Columbia Coast . The intrusions are thought to be subvolcanic bodies associated with a volcanic front that was active in the Miocene , during early stages of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate . With the notable exception of King Island , all the intrusive and eruptive rocks are calc @-@ alkaline , mainly <unk> bodies and dacite ejecta . 
 On a broader scale , the intrusive and eruptive rocks are part of the Coast Plutonic Complex , which is the single largest contiguous granite outcropping in North America . The intrusive and metamorphic rocks extend approximately 1 @,@ 800 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 100 mi ) along the coast of British Columbia , the Alaska Panhandle and southwestern Yukon . This is a remnant of a once vast volcanic arc called the Coast Range Arc that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon and Kula Plates during the Jurassic @-@ to @-@ Eocene periods . In contrast , Garibaldi , Mount Meager , Mount Cayley and Silverthrone areas are of recent volcanic origin . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 Like other calderas , Silverthrone formed as a result of emptying the magma chamber beneath the volcano . If enough magma is erupted , the emptied chamber will not be able to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it . A roughly circular fracture — a " ring fault " — develops around the edge of the chamber . These ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions that are also known as ring dikes . Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture . As the magma chamber empties , the center of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse . The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption , or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions . The total area that collapses may be hundreds of thousands of square kilometers . 
 Steep contacts between the thick basal breccia of Mount Silverthrone and older crystalline rocks of adjacent peaks suggest that the breccia is part of a caldera @-@ fill succession . The presence of irregular subvolcanic intrusions and a profusion of dikes within the breccia — but not in adjacent country rock — provide further evidence of the Silverthrone Caldera . Potassium @-@ argon dates of 750 @,@ 000 and 400 @,@ 000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal breccia are consistent with the high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains . 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The still largely unexplained tectonic causes of the volcanism that has produced the Silverthrone Caldera are a matter of ongoing research . Silverthrone is not above a hotspot as are Nazko or Hawaii . However , it may be a product of the Cascadia subduction zone because andesite , basaltic andesite , dacite and rhyolite can be found at the volcano and elsewhere along the subduction zone . At issue are the current plate configuration and rate of subduction but Silverthrone 's chemistry indicates that Silverthrone is subduction related . 
 The Cascadia subduction zone is a long convergent plate boundary that separates the Juan de Fuca , Explorer , Gorda and North American Plates . Here , the oceanic crust of the Pacific Ocean sinks beneath North America at a rate of 40 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) per year . Hot magma upwelling above the descending oceanic plate creates volcanoes , each of which erupts for a few million years . It is estimated that the subduction zone has existed for at least 37 million years ; in that time it has created a line of volcanoes , called the Cascade Volcanic Arc , that stretches over 1 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) along the subduction zone from Northern California to Vancouver Island . Several volcanoes in the arc are potentially active . All of the known historic eruptions in the arc have been in the United States . Two of the most recent were Lassen Peak in 1914 to 1921 and the major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 . It is also the site of Canada 's most recent major eruption , about 2 @,@ 350 years ago at the Mount Meager volcanic complex . 
 = = = Eruptive history = = = 
 Very little is known about Silverthrone ’ s eruptive history . However , as at other calderas , eruptions at Silverthrone are explosive in nature , involving viscous magma , glowing avalanches of hot volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows . The source magma of this rock is classified as acidic , having high to intermediate levels of silica , as in rhyolite , dacite , and andesite . <unk> and rhyolitic magma are commonly associated with the two forms of explosive eruptions called Plinian and Peléan eruptions . Silverthrone is considerably younger than its nearest prominent neighbour Franklin Glacier Volcano to the east @-@ southeast . 
 Most of the caldera 's eruptive products have been heavily eroded by alpine glaciers and are now exposed in precipitous slopes extending from near sea level to elevations less than 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . The bulk of the complex appears to have been erupted between 100 @,@ 000 and 500 @,@ 000 years ago , but postglacial andesitic and basaltic andesite cones and lava flows are also present . <unk> old potassium @-@ argon dates of 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 years were obtained from a large lava flow at least 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) long in the postglacial Pashleth Creek and Machmell River valleys . This blocky lava flow is clearly much younger than the potassium @-@ argon date , and high @-@ energy glacial streams have only begun to etch a channel along the margin of the lava flow . The younger andesitic rocks issued from a cluster of vents , now mostly ice @-@ covered , ranged around the periphery of the caldera . At high elevations , proximal breccia and cinders from several eroded cones rest on coarse colluvium derived from the older parts of the volcanic complex . The presence of unconsolidated glacial fluvial deposits under the flow suggest that it is less than 1 @,@ 000 years old . 
 Although the particular Volcanic Explosivity Index ( VEI ) of the Silverthrone Caldera is unknown , the chemistry and structure of the volcano can be compared to other calderas that have a history of producing some of the world 's most violent eruptions . It is about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) long and 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) wide while the Crater Lake caldera in Oregon , United States is 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) long and 8 kilometres ( 5 mi ) wide . Such calderas are usually formed by large cataclysmic eruptions reaching 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index ( described as " super @-@ colossal " ) . 
 = = = Current activity = = = 
 Silverthrone Caldera is one of the eleven Canadian volcanoes associated with recent seismic activity : the others are Castle Rock , Mount Edziza , Mount Cayley , Hoodoo Mountain , The Volcano , Crow Lagoon , Mount Garibaldi , Mount Meager , Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater Volcanic Field and Nazko Cone . Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain live magma plumbing systems , indicating possible future eruptive activity . Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion , these observations are further indications that some of Canada 's volcanoes are potentially active , and that their associated hazards may be significant . The seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada 's most youthful volcanoes , and with long @-@ lived volcanic centers with a history of significant explosive behavior , such as the Silverthrone Caldera . 
 = = Volcanic hazards = = 
 Volcanic eruptions in Canada rarely cause fatalities because of their remoteness and low level of activity . The only known fatality due to volcanic activity in Canada occurred at the Tseax Cone in 1775 , when a 22 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 14 @.@ 0 mi ) long lava flow traveled down the Tseax and Nass Rivers , destroying a Nisga 'a village and killing approximately 2 @,@ 000 people by volcanic gases . Towns and cities south of Silverthrone are home to well over half of British Columbia 's human population , and there is a likelihood that future eruptions will cause damage to populated areas , making Silverthrone and other Garibaldi belt volcanoes further south a major potential hazard . For this reason , additional projects to study Silverthrone and other Garibaldi belt volcanoes to the south are being planned by the Geological Survey of Canada . There are significant hazards from almost all Canadian volcanoes that require hazard maps and emergency plans . Volcanoes which exhibit significant seismic activity , such as Silverthrone , appear to be most likely to erupt . A significant eruption of any of the Garibaldi belt volcanoes would significantly impact Highway 99 and communities like Pemberton , Whistler and Squamish , and possibly Vancouver . 
 = = = Explosive eruptions = = = 
 The explosive nature of past eruptions at Silverthrone Caldera suggests that this volcano poses a significant long @-@ distance threat to communities across Canada . A large explosive eruption can produce large amounts of ash that could significantly affect communities across Canada . Ash columns could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano which would make this a hazard for air traffic along the coastal airway between Vancouver and Alaska . Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure as well as damage to other aircraft systems . In addition , pyroclastic fall could also have a deleterious effect on the Ha @-@ <unk> Icefield surrounding the volcano . Melting of glacial ice could cause lahars or debris flows . This in turn could endanger water supplies on the Machmell River and other local water sources . 
 = = = Lava flows = = = 
 Because the Silverthrone region is in a remote and exceptionally rugged part of the Coast Mountains , danger from lava flows would be low to moderate . Magma with high to intermediate levels of silica ( as in andesite , dacite or rhyolite ) commonly move slowly and typically cover small areas to form steep @-@ sided mounds called lava domes . Lava domes often grow by the extrusion of many individual flows less than 30 metres ( 98 ft ) thick over a period of several months or years . Such flows will overlap one another and typically move less than a few meters per hour . But lava eruptions at Silverthrone Caldera can be more intense than those at other Cascade volcanoes . Lava flows with high to intermediate levels of silica rarely extend more than 8 kilometres ( 5 mi ) from their source while Silverthrone has produced a 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) long andesitic lava flow in the Pashleth Creek and Machmell River valleys . There is also evidence lava flows may have once partly blocked or at least altered the course of the Machmell River . Renewed activity in this area could disrupt the course of the river and have a serious impact on people living or working downstream . 
 = = = Volcanic gas = = = 
 Volcanic gas includes a variety of substances . These include gases trapped in cavities ( vesicles ) in volcanic rocks , dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava , or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action . The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people , animals , agriculture , and property are sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride . Locally , sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano . Globally , large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere can lead to lower surface temperatures and promote weakening of the Earth 's ozone layer . Because carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air , the gas may flow into low @-@ lying areas and collect in the soil . The concentration of carbon dioxide gas in these areas can be lethal to people , animals , and vegetation . 
 = = Monitoring = = 
 Currently Silverthrone is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcano 's magma system is . The existing network of seismographs has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the caldera . It may sense an increase in activity if the volcano becomes very restless , but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption . It might detect activity only after the volcano has started erupting . 
 A possible way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone 's geological history since every volcano has its own pattern of behavior , in terms of its eruption style , magnitude and frequency , so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions . But this would likely be abandoned in part because of the volcano 's remoteness . 
 While there is a likelihood of Canada being critically affected by local or close by volcanic eruptions argues that some kind of improvement program is required . Benefit @-@ cost thoughts are critical to dealing with natural hazards . However , a benefit @-@ cost examination needs correct data about the hazard types , magnitudes and occurrences . These do not exist for volcanoes in British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada in the detail required . 
 Other volcanic techniques , such as hazard mapping , displays a volcano 's eruptive history in detail and speculates an understanding of the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future . At present no hazard maps have been created for the Silverthrone Caldera because the level of knowledge is insufficient due to its remoteness . A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada . The majority of information has been collected in a lengthy , separate way from the support of several employees , such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists . Current knowledge is best established at Mount Meager and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project . Knowledge at the Silverthrone Caldera and other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is not as established , but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley . An intensive program classifiying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts . 
 The existing network of seismographs to monitor tectonic earthquakes has existed since 1975 , although it remained small in population until 1985 . Apart from a few short @-@ term seismic monitoring experiments by the Geological Survey of Canada , no volcano monitoring has been accomplished at the Silverthrone Caldera or at other volcanoes in Canada at a level approaching that in other established countries with historically active volcanoes . Active or restless volcanoes are usually monitored using at least three seismographs all within approximately 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) , and frequently within 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) , for better sensitivity of detection and reduced location errors , particularly for earthquake depth . Such monitoring detects the risk of an eruption , offering a forecasting capability which is important to mitigating volcanic risk . Currently the Silverthrone Caldera does not have a seismograph closer than 124 kilometres ( 77 mi ) . With increasing distance and declining numbers of seismographs used to indicate seismic activity , the prediction capability is reduced because earthquake location and depth measurement accuracy decreases . The inaccurate earthquake locations in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt are a few kilometers , and in more isolated northern regions they are up to 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) . The location magnitude level in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is about magnitude 1 to 1 @.@ 5 , and elsewhere it is magnitude 1 @.@ 5 to 2 . At " carefully monitored volcanoes both the located and noticed events are recorded and surveyed immediately to improve the understanding of a future eruption . Undetected events are not recorded or surveyed in British Columbia immediately , nor in an easy @-@ to @-@ access process . 
 In countries like Canada it is possible that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected , particularly if no events were observed ; more significant events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of the swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature , or even associate them with an individual volcanic edifice . 
 = Jury Duty ( The Office ) = 
 " Jury Duty " is the thirteenth episode of the eighth season of the American comedy television series The Office and the show 's 165th episode overall . The episode aired on NBC in the United States on February 2 , 2012 . The episode was written by Aaron Shure and directed by Eric Appel . The episode guest starred Jack Coleman , Lindsey Broad , and Mark Proksch . 
 The series — presented as if it were a real documentary — depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In this episode , Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) returns from jury duty and Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) questions him on every detail of his case . However , Jim later comes under fire when the office realizes he faked jury duty to spend time with his wife , Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) and their new baby , Phillip . Meanwhile , Angela ( Angela Kinsey ) and the state senator welcome their new baby . 
 " Jury Duty " marks the first appearance of Fischer since " Gettysburg " , when her character went on maternity leave . " Jury Duty " received mostly positive reviews from critics , with many reviews noting that the episode was a step in the right direction for the show . According to Nielsen Media Research , " Jury Duty " drew 5 @.@ 31 million viewers and received a 2 @.@ 8 rating / 7 % share in the 18 – 49 demographic , marking a 10 % drop in ratings from the previous episode , " Pool Party " . Despite this , it was the highest @-@ rated NBC series of the night . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) returns from jury duty and learns that , in his week @-@ long absence , his co @-@ workers were forced to make up for his vacancy , suffering setbacks and inconveniences in the process . Jim reveals to the camera that , while he was called for duty , he was dismissed at noon and headed home to Pam and their two children ; he saw that Pam was overwhelmed and took the rest of the week off to help take care of their children . To appease his interested co @-@ workers , Jim fabricates numerous details of his jury duty , and Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) becomes suspicious when Jim mistakenly refers to a food truck franchise Toby ate at during his jury duty as a " restaurant " . Dwight accuses Jim of lying about jury duty and extracts from Andy a promise to fire Jim if it proves he was indeed lying . Ashamed , Jim privately admits his guilt to Andy , who insists that they keep the matter a secret so that he won 't be held to his promise to fire Jim . However , Dwight increases his attempts to prove Jim 's guilt , and Jim finally decides to defy Andy 's orders and tell his co @-@ workers the truth rather than wait for Dwight to inevitably expose him . While this angers most of the employees , Dwight is thrilled at the confession and demands that Andy keep his promise to fire Jim . Andy refuses , so Dwight tries to contact Gabe . To smooth things over , Jim and Pam bring in their children , Cece and Phillip , to present pictures that they drew for the co @-@ workers . It becomes clear that Jim and Pam drew the pictures themselves , but before the members of the office can berate the couple , Cece and Phillip begin crying loudly , creating a cacophony that Jim and Pam struggle to control , forcing them to take the children back to the car . Realizing the stress that having young children causes , the office workers , ultimately , do not blame Jim for his behavior and even suggest he leave early to help Pam . 
 Meanwhile , Angela ( Angela Kinsey ) and her husband , state senator Robert Lipton ( Jack Coleman ) , welcome their new baby , also named Phillip . Oscar , Kevin , Erin , and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital . According to Angela , the baby was born prematurely , but due to the size , Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception . Angela admits that the baby was conceived a month before her wedding , and makes them promise not to tell anyone . Suspecting that Dwight is the real father , Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe . Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child . When the senator leaves , Dwight confronts Angela about the child , claiming that it is his . She refutes his claim , but Dwight leaves satisfied , telling the attending nurse to call off the baby 's circumcision , which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do . Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim , since his self @-@ assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood . The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car , in honor of his covert new family member .

 " Jury Duty " was written by consulting producer Aaron Shure , his sixth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the fifth season . It was directed by Eric Appel , his first directing credit for the series . The episode features a guest appearance from Jack Coleman as Senator Robert Lipton , Angela 's husband , who first appeared in the seventh season episode , " <unk> " . The episode marks the first appearance of Jenna Fischer since " Gettysburg " . Due to her pregnancy , she was on maternity leave for four episodes . Her pregnancy was written into the series , with Pam and Jim having their second baby . Unlike the sixth season , there was no episode focusing on the baby 's birth ; it was instead announced on a blog . According to show runner Paul Lieberstein , she will come back " with very little fanfare " . The episode also marks the seventh appearance of Lindsey Broad , who plays Cathy , Pam 's replacement during her maternity leave . She appeared in a recurring role for the season , after she initially appeared in " Pam 's Replacement " . The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Andy getting a friend of his , who starred in the Scranton production of Sweeney Todd , to pretend to be a police officer , only to have Darryl uncover the truth , Dwight telling the camera about a recurring nightmare where he is on trial and all of his co @-@ workers are the members of the jury , and Jim trying to make it up to the office by buying all of the despised black licorice from the vending machines so that the rest of the office has access to the red licorice . However , his plan goes awry and his co @-@ workers make him eat all of the black licorice as punishment .

 " Jury Duty " received mostly positive reviews from critics and was considered by many critics to be a major step in the right direction for the series . Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that , " [ ' Jury Duty ' ] was a step , if not a leap , in the right direction for the show -- which , let 's be honest , is showing its fatigue and staleness ; possibly nearing its end ; clearly suffering without Steve Carell . " Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review , calling the episode " fun and surprisingly sweet . " McQuinn enjoyed the episode 's developments , most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not " forget about it like almost every other development this season . " New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more " tightly written " . He also complimented Krasinski 's " understated " performance as well as Wilson 's acting , citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela 's baby might be his . Despite this , he criticized the cold opening and the " miming chill pill " scene . Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review , saying , " After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing [ ... ] , the rest of this week 's episode of The Office is a success . [ ... ] This is one of my favorite episodes I can remember in a long time . Not too plot driven and chock @-@ full of solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made me feel good . To get a few of my favorite lines , just keep reading . " 
 However , several critics gave the episode a mixed review . Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- rating and , although critical of the lack of stakes for the characters , remarked that , " ' Jury Duty ' had a certain confidence to it . It may not have satisfyingly explored Jim ’ s character , but it ended with a clear statement of his role as a father , reintroducing Jenna Fischer into the cast and putting a button on that particular story development . " Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode a 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars and wrote , " there were definitely some ups and some downs in ' Jury Duty ' . " However , he did praise the action of several characters , most notably Kevin and Dwight . Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture gave the episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote , " I truly appreciate the talented writing of Aaron Shure who crafted a genuinely well @-@ structured episode .

Hisaishi , who previously worked with Studio Ghibli on films such as Princess Mononoke ( 1997 ) and Spirited Away ( 2001 ) , met with Level @-@ 5 producer and writer Akihiro Hino . After witnessing Hino 's passion for the project , Hisaishi agreed to work on the soundtrack . Rei Kondoh created the other half of the score , and all in @-@ game music was performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra . " Kokoro no Kakera " , the games ' theme song , was written by Hisaishi ; his daughter Mai Fujisawa performed the song in Japanese , while chorister Archie Buchanan performed the English version . The team found great difficulty in selecting a performer for the English version , though ultimately settled upon Buchanan due to his ability to convey the " vulnerability and innocence " of the games characters in a " moving and powerful performance " . For the orchestral music to fit onto the Nintendo DS at a high quality , Ni no Kuni : Dominion of the Dark Djinn was shipped on a 4 @-@ gigabit game card . 
 Hisaishi wrote 21 songs as piano sketches , across seven days . He found that the rhythm of the score was more complex than expected , but felt that this is " usually a good sign " , which encouraged him to continue . The music was intended to reflect the fantasy genre , and contain an elegance based on traditional folk music of Ireland ; Hisaishi described the music as " nostalgic , but still connected to the future " . Hisaishi also felt a compatibility between his music and the world that the development team was creating , stating that their ideas generally worked naturally in " perfect unison " . 
 For the soundtracks , the piano was performed by Febian Reza Pane , the lute by Hiroshi Kaneko , the sitar by Masahiro Itami , the whistle by Hideyo <unk> , and the tabla by Ikuo <unk> . All music was recorded at Yokohama Minato Mirai Hall by <unk> Creative Studio , while Wonder Station mixed the soundtrack at Azabu @-@ O Studio . Hiroyuki Akita oversaw the former , as recording engineer . Hisaishi would also return to work on the score for Ni no Kuni II : Revenant Kingdom .

 In the context of the game , the soundtrack was well received . Colin Moriarty of IGN felt that it was appropriate in every situation , praising its ability to create emotion and involve players in the experience . GameTrailers found the soundtrack " powerful " , commenting on its appropriate use during gameplay , and GamesRadar 's Brittany Vincent named it " breathtaking " . Jen Bosier of Forbes approved of the soundtrack 's usage within the game , particularly praising the piano pieces . Jim Sterling of Destructoid favorably compared the soundtrack to Dragon Quest VIII , praising the orchestral qualities and " sense of fun " . Chris Scullion of Computer and Video Games wrote that the music ensures the game " sounds as good as it looks " . Robert Steinman of RPGFan felt that the music perfectly sets the tone of the game , stating that it is among " some of the best work " of video game music , and Jasmine Rea of VentureBeat found that the music " enhances the overall Ghibli quality " to the game . Eurogamer 's Oli Welsh called the music " a lush and romantic treat " , though criticized the repetitiveness of the battle music . Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku echoed similar remarks , heavily criticizing the battle music , but otherwise calling the music " uncommonly gorgeous " . 
 Ni no Kuni : Wrath of the White Witch won Best Sound from Cheat Code Central , and the soundtrack received nominations at the 2011 International Film Music Critics Association , 2014 SXSW Gaming Awards and Spike VGX 2013 , and from Destructoid and GameTrailers . The game 's main theme , " Kokoro no Kakera " , also won the award for Original / Adapted Song at the 13th National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards . 
 = Upanishads = 
 The Upanishads ( Sanskrit : Upaniṣad ; IPA : [ <unk> ̪ <unk> ̪ ] ) are a collection of texts that contain some of the central philosophical concepts of Hinduism , some of which are shared with Buddhism and Jainism . The Upanishads are considered by Hindus to contain utterances ( <unk> ) concerning the nature of ultimate reality ( brahman ) and describing the character of and path to human salvation ( mokṣa or mukti ) . 
 The Upanishads are commonly referred to as Vedānta , variously interpreted to mean either the " last chapters , parts of the Veda " or " the object , the highest purpose of the Veda " . The concepts of Brahman ( Ultimate Reality ) and Ātman ( Soul , Self ) are central ideas in all the Upanishads , and " Know your Ātman " their thematic focus . The Upanishads are the foundation of Hindu philosophical thought and its diverse traditions . Of the Vedic corpus , they alone are widely known , and the central ideas of the Upanishads are at the spiritual core of Hindus . 
 More than 200 Upanishads are known , of which the first dozen or so are the oldest and most important and are referred to as the principal or main ( mukhya ) Upanishads . The mukhya Upanishads are found mostly in the concluding part of the Brahmanas and <unk> and were , for centuries , memorized by each generation and passed down orally . The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era , some in all likelihood pre @-@ Buddhist ( 6th century BCE ) , down to the Maurya period . Of the remainder , some 95 Upanishads are part of the Muktika canon , composed from about the last centuries of 1st @-@ millennium BCE through about 15th @-@ century CE . New Upanishads , beyond the 108 in the Muktika canon , continued to be composed through the early modern and modern era , though often dealing with subjects which are unconnected to the Vedas . 
 Along with the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahmasutra , the mukhya Upanishads ( known collectively as the Prasthanatrayi ) provide a foundation for the several later schools of Vedanta , among them , two influential monistic schools of Hinduism . 
 With the translation of the Upanishads in the early 19th century they also started to attract attention from a western audience . Arthur Schopenhauer was deeply impressed by the Upanishads and called it " the production of the highest human wisdom " . The 19th @-@ century transcendentalists noted the influence of the Upanishads in western philosophy . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The Sanskrit term Upaniṣad ( u 
 = at , pa = 
 foot , <unk> = sitting down ) translates to " sitting at the foot / feet of " , referring to the student sitting down near the teacher while receiving esoteric knowledge . Monier @-@ Williams ' Sanskrit Dictionary adds that , " According to native authorities Upanishad means ' setting to rest ignorance by revealing the knowledge of the supreme spirit . ' " 
 Shri Adi Shankara explains in his commentary on the <unk> and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad that the word means <unk> , that is , " knowledge of the Self " , or <unk> " knowledge of Brahma " . Other dictionary meanings include " esoteric doctrine " and " secret doctrine " . The word appears in the verses of many Upanishads , such as the fourth verse of the 13th volume in first chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad . Max Muller as well as Paul Deussen translate the word Upanishad in these verses as " secret doctrine " , Robert Hume translates it as " mystic meaning " , while Patrick Olivelle translates it as " hidden connections " . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Authorship = = = 
 The authorship of most Upanishads is uncertain and unknown . Radhakrishnan states , " almost all the early literature of India was anonymous , we do not know the names of the authors of the Upanishads " . The various philosophical theories in the early Upanishads have been attributed to famous sages such as Yajnavalkya , Uddalaka Aruni , <unk> , Shandilya , Aitareya , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Women , such as Maitreyi and Gargi participate in the dialogues and are also credited in the early Upanishads . 
 There are exceptions to the anonymous tradition of the Upanishads and other Vedic literature . The Shvetashvatara Upanishad , for example , includes closing credits to sage Shvetashvatara , and he is considered the author of the Upanishad . Scholars believe that early Upanishads , were interpolated and expanded over time , because of the differences within manuscripts of the same Upanishad discovered in different parts of South Asia , differences in non @-@ Sanskrit version of the texts that have survived , and differences within each text in terms of the meter , the style , the grammar and the structure . The texts as they exist now is believed to be the work of many authors . 
 = = = Chronology = = = 
 Scholars are uncertain about the exact centuries in which the Upanishads were composed . The chronology of the early Upanishads is difficult to resolve , states philosopher and <unk> Stephen Phillips , because all opinions rest on scanty evidence and analysis of archaism , style and repetitions across texts , and are driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas , and presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies . Indologist Patrick Olivelle says that " in spite of claims made by some , in reality , any dating of these documents [ early Upanishads ] that attempts a precision closer than a few centuries is as stable as a house of cards " . Some scholars have sought to analyse similarities between Hindu Upanishads and Buddhist literature to establish chronology for the Upanishads . 
 Patrick Olivelle gives the following chronology for the early Upanishads , also called the Principal Upanishads : 
 The <unk> and the Chandogya are the two earliest Upanishads . They are edited texts , some of whose sources are much older than others . The two texts are pre @-@ Buddhist ; they may be placed in the 7th to 6th centuries BCE , give or take a century or so . 
 The three other early prose Upanisads — Taittiriya , Aitareya , and <unk> come next ; all are probably pre @-@ Buddhist and can be assigned to the 6th to 5th centuries BCE . 
 The Kena is the oldest of the verse Upanisads followed by probably the Katha , Isa , Svetasvatara , and Mundaka . All these Upanisads were composed probably in the last few centuries BCE . 
 The two late prose Upanisads , the Prasna and the Mandukya , cannot be much older than the beginning of the common era . 
 Stephen Phillips places the early Upanishads in the 800 to 300 BCE range . He summarizes the current <unk> opinion to be that the <unk> , Chandogya , Isha , Taittiriya , Aitareya , Kena , Katha , Mundaka , and Prasna Upanishads are all pre @-@ Buddhist and pre @-@ Jain , while Svetasvatara and Mandukya overlap with the earliest Buddhist and Jain literature . 
 The later Upanishads numbering about 95 , also called minor Upanishads , are dated from the late 1st @-@ millennium BCE to mid 2nd @-@ millennium CE . Gavin Flood dates many of the twenty Yoga Upanishads to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period . Patrick Olivelle and other scholars date seven of the twenty Sannyasa Upanishads to likely have been complete sometime between the last centuries of the 1st @-@ millennium BCE to 300 CE . About half of the Sannyasa Upanishads were likely composed in 14th- to 15th @-@ century CE . 
 = = = Geography = = = 
 The general area of the composition of the early Upanishads was northern India , the region bounded on the west by the upper Indus valley , on the east by lower Ganges region , on the north by the Himalayan foothills , and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range . There is confidence about the early Upanishads being the product of the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism , comprising the regions of Kuru @-@ Panchala and Kosala @-@ Videha together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these . This region covers modern Bihar , Nepal , Uttar Pradesh , Uttarakhand , Himachal Pradesh , Haryana , eastern Rajasthan and northern Madhya Pradesh . 
 While significant attempts have been made recently to identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads , the results are tentative . Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha , whose king , Janaka , features prominently in the Upanishad . 
 The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more Western than an Eastern location in Indian subcontinent , possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru @-@ Panchala country . Compared to the Principal Upanishads , the new Upanishads recorded in the Muktikā belong to an entirely different region , probably southern India , and are considerably relatively recent . In fourth chapter of the <unk> Upanishad , a location named Kashi ( modern Varanasi ) is mentioned . 
 = = Classification = = 
 = = = Muktika canon : major and minor Upanishads = = = 
 There are more than 200 known Upanishads , one of which , Muktikā Upanishad , predates 1656 CE and contains a list of 108 canonical Upanishads , including itself as the last . The earliest ones such as the Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya Upanishads date to the early centuries of the 1st millennium BCE , and the latest to around the mid 2nd @-@ millennium CE during a period of Islamic invasions and political instability . Various scholars include the earliest 10 , 11 , 12 or 13 Upanishads as Mukhya ( major ) or Principal Upanishads , all composed in the 1st @-@ <unk> BCE . The remainder 95 to 98 are called " minor Upanishads " , and were likely composed between the last centuries of the 1st @-@ millennium BCE and about mid 2nd @-@ millennium CE . These are further divided into Upanishads associated with Shaktism ( goddess Shakti ) , Sannyasa ( renunciation , monastic life ) , Shaivism ( god Shiva ) , Vaishnavism ( god Vishnu ) , Yoga , and <unk> ( general , sometimes referred to as <unk> @-@ Vedanta ) . 
 Some of the Upanishads are categorized as " sectarian " since they present their ideas through a particular god or goddess of a specific Hindu tradition such as Vishnu , Shiva , Shakti , or a combination of these such as the Skanda Upanishad . These traditions sought to link their texts as Vedic , by asserting their texts to be an Upanishad , thereby a <unk> . Most of these sectarian Upanishads , for example the <unk> Upanishad and the Mahanarayana Upanishad , assert that all the Hindu gods and goddesses are the same , all an aspect and manifestation of Brahman , the Vedic concept for metaphysical ultimate reality before and after the creation of the Universe . 
 = = = Mukhya Upanishads = = = 
 The Mukhya Upanishads can be grouped into periods . Of the early periods are the Brihadaranyaka and the Chandogya , the oldest . 
 The Aitareya , <unk> and <unk> Upanishads may date to as early as the mid 1st millennium BCE , while the remnant date from between roughly the 4th to 1st centuries BCE , roughly contemporary with the earliest portions of the Sanskrit epics . It is alleged that the Aitareya , Taittiriya , <unk> , Mundaka , Prasna , and Katha Upanishads show Buddha 's influence , and must have been composed after the 5th century BCE , but it could just as easily have been the other way around . It is also alleged that in the first two centuries A.D. , they were followed by the Kena , Mandukya and Isa Upanishads , but other scholars date these earlier . Not much is known about the authors except for those , like <unk> and Uddalaka , mentioned in the texts . A few women discussants , such as Gargi and Maitreyi , the wife of <unk> , also feature occasionally . 
 Each of the principal Upanishads can be associated with one of the schools of exegesis of the four Vedas ( <unk> ) . Many <unk> are said to have existed , of which only a few remain . The new Upanishads often have little relation to the Vedic corpus and have not been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher : their language differs from that of the classic Upanishads , being less subtle and more formalized . As a result , they are not difficult to comprehend for the modern reader . 
 The <unk> and <unk> Upanishads are sometimes added to the list of the mukhya Upanishads . 
 = = = New Upanishads = = = 
 There is no fixed list of the Upanishads as newer ones , beyond the Muktika anthology of 108 Upanishads , have continued to be discovered and composed . In 1908 , for example , four previously unknown Upanishads were discovered in newly found manuscripts , and these were named <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , by Friedrich Schrader , who attributed them to the first prose period of the Upanishads . The text of three , the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , were incomplete and inconsistent , likely poorly maintained or corrupted . 
 Ancient Upanishads have long enjoyed a revered position in Hindu traditions , and authors of numerous sectarian texts have tried to benefit from this reputation by naming their texts as Upanishads . These " new Upanishads " number in the hundreds , cover diverse range of topics from physiology to renunciation to sectarian theories . They were composed between the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the early modern era ( ~ 1600 CE ) . While over two dozen of the minor Upanishads are dated to pre @-@ 3rd century CE , many of these new texts under the title of " Upanishads " originated in the first half of the 2nd millennium CE , they are not Vedic texts , and some do not deal with themes found in the Vedic Upanishads . 
 The main Shakta Upanishads , for example , mostly discuss doctrinal and interpretative differences between the two principal sects of a major Tantric form of Shaktism called Shri Vidya <unk> . The many extant lists of authentic Shakta <unk> vary , reflecting the sect of their compilers , so that they yield no evidence of their " location " in Tantric tradition , impeding correct interpretation . The Tantra content of these texts also weaken its identity as an Upaniṣad for non @-@ Tantrikas . Sectarian texts such as these do not enjoy status as <unk> and thus the authority of the new Upanishads as scripture is not accepted in Hinduism . 
 = = Association with Vedas = = 
 All Upanishads are associated with one of the four Vedas — Rigveda , Samaveda , Yajurveda ( there are two primary versions or <unk> of the Yajurveda : Shukla Yajurveda , Krishna Yajurveda ) , and Atharvaveda . During the modern era , the ancient Upanishads that were embedded texts in the Vedas , were detached from the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of Vedic text , compiled into separate texts and these were then gathered into anthologies of Upanishads . These lists associated each Upanishad with one of the four Vedas , many such lists exist , and these lists are inconsistent across India in terms of which Upanishads are included and how the newer Upanishads are assigned to the ancient Vedas . In south India , the collected list based on Muktika Upanishad , and published in Telugu language , became the most common by the 19th @-@ century and this is a list of 108 Upanishads . In north India , a list of 52 Upanishads has been most common . 
 The Muktikā Upanishad 's list of 108 Upanishads groups the first 13 as mukhya , 21 as <unk> Vedānta , 20 as <unk> , 14 as Vaishnava , 12 as Shaiva , 8 as Shakta , and 20 as Yoga . The 108 Upanishads as recorded in the Muktikā are shown in the table below . The mukhya Upanishads are the most important and highlighted . 
 = = Philosophy = = 
 The Upanishadic age was characterized by a pluralism of worldviews . While some Upanishads have been deemed ' monistic ' , others , including the Katha Upanishad , are dualistic . The Maitri is one of the Upanishads that inclines more toward dualism , thus grounding classical Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism , in contrast to the non @-@ dualistic Upanishads at the foundation of its Vedanta school . They contain a plurality of ideas . 
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan states that the Upanishads have dominated Indian philosophy , religion and life ever since their appearance . The Upanishads are respected not because they are considered revealed ( Shruti ) , but because they present spiritual ideas that are inspiring . The Upanishads are treatises on Brahman @-@ knowledge , that is knowledge of Ultimate Hidden Reality , and their presentation of philosophy presumes , " it is by a strictly personal effort that one can reach the truth " . In the Upanishads , states Radhakrishnan , knowledge is a means to freedom , and philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom by a way of life . 
 The Upanishads include sections on philosophical theories that have been at the foundation of Indian traditions . For example , the Chandogya Upanishad includes one of the earliest known declaration of Ahimsa ( non @-@ violence ) as an ethical precept . Discussion of other ethical premises such as <unk> ( temperance , self @-@ restraint ) , Satya ( truthfulness ) , Dāna ( charity ) , Ārjava ( non @-@ hypocrisy ) , Daya ( compassion ) and others are found in the oldest Upanishads and many later Upanishads . Similarly , the Karma doctrine is presented in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , which is the oldest Upanishad . 
 = = = Development of thought = = = 
 While the hymns of the Vedas emphasize rituals and the Brahmanas serve as a liturgical manual for those Vedic rituals , the spirit of the Upanishads is inherently opposed to ritual . The older Upanishads launch attacks of increasing intensity on the ritual . Anyone who worships a divinity other than the Self is called a domestic animal of the gods in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . The Chāndogya Upanishad parodies those who indulge in the acts of sacrifice by comparing them with a procession of dogs chanting Om ! Let 's eat . Om ! Let 's drink . 
 The <unk> Upanishad asserts that " external rituals such as <unk> offered in the morning and in the evening , must be replaced with inner <unk> , the ritual of introspection " , and that " not rituals , but knowledge should be one 's pursuit " . The Mundaka Upanishad declares how man has been called upon , promised benefits for , scared unto and misled into performing sacrifices , oblations and pious works . Mundaka thereafter asserts this is foolish and frail , by those who encourage it and those who follow it , because it makes no difference to man 's current life and after @-@ life , it is like blind men leading the blind , it is a mark of conceit and vain knowledge , ignorant inertia like that of children , a futile useless practice . The Maitri Upanishad states , 
 The performance of all the sacrifices , described in the <unk> @-@ Brahmana , is to lead up in the end to a knowledge of Brahman , to prepare a man for meditation . Therefore , let such man , after he has laid those fires , meditate on the Self , to become complete and perfect . 
 The opposition to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads . On occasions , the Upanishads extend the task of the <unk> by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning . For example , the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse @-@ sacrifice or <unk> allegorically . It states that the over @-@ lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse . It then goes on to say that spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse . 
 In similar fashion , Vedic gods such as the Agni , Aditya , Indra , Rudra , <unk> , Brahma and others become equated in the Upanishads to the supreme , immortal and incorporeal Brahman @-@ Atman of the Upanishads , god becomes synonymous with Self , and is declared to be everywhere , inmost being of each human being and within every living creature . The one reality or <unk> sat of the Vedas becomes the <unk> <unk> <unk> or " the one and only and sans a second " in the Upanishads . Brahman @-@ Atman and Self @-@ realization develops , in the Upanishad , as the means to moksha ( liberation , freedom in this life or after @-@ life ) . 
 According to Jayatilleke , the thinkers of Upanishadic texts can be grouped into two categories . One group , which includes Early Upanishads along with some Middle and Late Upanishads , were composed by <unk> who used rational arguments and empirical experience to formulate their speculations and philosophical premises . The second group includes many middle and later Upanishads , where their authors professed theories based on yoga and personal experiences . Yoga philosophy and practice , adds Jayatilleke , is " not entirely absent in the Early Upanishads " . The development of thought in these Upanishadic theories contrasted with Buddhism , since the Upanishadic inquiry assumed there is a soul ( Atman ) , while Buddhism assumed there is no soul ( <unk> ) , states Jayatilleke . 
 = = = Brahman and Atman = = = 
 Two concepts that are of paramount importance in the Upanishads are Brahman and Atman . The Brahman is the ultimate reality and the Atman is individual self ( soul ) . Brahman is the material , efficient , formal and final cause of all that exists . It is the pervasive , genderless , infinite , eternal truth and bliss which does not change , yet is the cause of all changes . Brahman is " the infinite source , fabric , core and destiny of all existence , both manifested and <unk> , the formless infinite substratum and from which the universe has grown " . Brahman in Hinduism , states Paul Deussen , as the " creative principle which lies realized in the whole world " . 
 The word Atman means the inner self , the soul , the immortal spirit in an individual , and all living beings including animals and trees . Ātman is a central idea in all the Upanishads , and " Know your Ātman " their thematic focus . These texts state that the inmost core of every person is not the body , nor the mind , nor the ego , but Atman – " Soul " or " Self " . Atman is the spiritual essence in all creatures , their real innermost essential being . It is eternal , it is ageless . Atman is that which one is at the deepest level of one 's existence . 
 Atman is the predominantly discussed topic in the Upanishads , but they express two distinct , somewhat divergent themes . Some state that Brahman ( Highest Reality , Universal Principle , Being @-@ Consciousness @-@ Bliss ) is identical with Atman , while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical . This ancient debate flowered into various dual , non @-@ dual theories in Hinduism . The Brahmasutra by <unk> ( ~ 100 BCE ) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories , stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects particularly during the state of ignorance , but at the deepest level and in the state of Self @-@ realization , Atman and Brahman are identical , non @-@ different . 
 The idea put forth by the Upanishadic seers that Atman and Brahman are One and the same is one of the greatest contributions made to the thought of the world . 
 = = = Illusion = = = 
 Two different types of the non @-@ dual Brahman @-@ Atman are presented in the Upanishads , according to Mahadevan . The one in which the non @-@ dual Brahman @-@ Atman is the all inclusive ground of the universe and another in which empirical , changing universe is a form of Maya , often translated as " illusion " . 
 The Upanishads describe the universe , and the human experience , as an interplay of Purusha ( the eternal , unchanging principles , consciousness ) and Prakṛti ( the temporary , changing material world , nature ) . The former manifests itself as Ātman ( Soul , Self ) , and the latter as Māyā . The Upanishads refer to the knowledge of Atman as " true knowledge " ( Vidya ) , and the knowledge of Maya as " not true knowledge " ( Avidya , <unk> , lack of awareness , lack of true knowledge ) . 
 Hendrick Vroom explains , " the term Maya [ in the Upanishads ] has been translated as ' illusion , ' but then it does not concern normal illusion . Here ' illusion ' does not mean that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination . Maya means that the world is not as it seems ; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned . " According to Wendy Doniger , " to say that the universe is an illusion ( māyā ) is not to say that it is unreal ; it is to say , instead , that it is not what it seems to be , that it is something constantly being made . Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know ; more basically , it limits their knowledge . " 
 In the Upanishads , Māyā is the perceived changing reality and it co @-@ exists with Brahman which is the hidden true reality . Maya , or " illusion " , is an important idea in the Upanishads , because the texts assert that in the human pursuit of blissful and liberating Self @-@ knowledge , it is Maya which obscures , confuses and distracts an individual . 
 = = Schools of Vedanta = = 
 The Upanishads form one of the three main sources for all schools of Vedanta , together with the Bhagavad Gita and the <unk> . Due to the wide variety of philosophical teachings contained in the Upanishads , various interpretations could be grounded on the Upanishads . The schools of Vedānta seek to answer questions about the relation between atman and Brahman , and the relation between Brahman and the world . The schools of Vedanta are named after the relation they see between atman and Brahman : 
 According to Advaita Vedanta , there is no difference . 
 According to Vishishtadvaita the <unk> is a part of Brahman , and hence is similar , but not identical . 
 According to Dvaita , all individual souls ( <unk> ) and matter as eternal and mutually separate entities . 
 Other schools of Vedanta include <unk> 's <unk> , Vallabha 's <unk> and Chaitanya 's <unk> <unk> . The philosopher Adi Sankara has provided commentaries on 11 mukhya Upanishads . 
 = = = Advaita Vedanta = = = 
 Advaita literally means non @-@ duality , and it is a monistic system of thought . It deals with the non @-@ dual nature of Brahman and Atman . Advaita is considered the most influential sub @-@ school of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy . Gaudapada was the first person to expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting statements of the Upanishads . Gaudapada 's Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara . King states that Gaudapada 's main work , <unk> <unk> , is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism , and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies . King also suggests that there are clear differences between Shankara 's writings and the Brahmasutra , and many ideas of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads . Radhakrishnan , on the other hand , suggests that Shankara 's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra , and many ideas of Shankara derive from the Upanishads . 
 Shankara in his discussions of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy referred to the early Upanishads to explain the key difference between Hinduism and Buddhism , stating that Hinduism asserts " Atman ( Soul , Self ) exists " , while Buddhism asserts that there is " no Soul , no Self " . 
 The Upanishads contain four sentences , the <unk> ( Great Sayings ) , which were used by Shankara to establish the identity of Atman and Brahman as scriptural truth : 
 " <unk> brahma " - " Consciousness is Brahman " ( Aitareya Upanishad ) 
 " <unk> <unk> " - " I am Brahman " ( Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ) 
 " Tat <unk> <unk> " - " That Thou art " ( Chandogya Upanishad ) 
 " <unk> brahma " - " This Atman is Brahman " ( Mandukya Upanishad ) 
 Although there are a wide variety of philosophical positions propounded in the Upanishads , commentators since Adi Shankara have usually followed him in seeing idealist monism as the dominant force . 
 = = = Dvaita = = = 
 The Dvaita school was founded by Madhvacharya . Dvaita is regarded as the best philosophic exposition of theism . Madhva , much like Adi Shankara claims for Advaita , states that his theistic Dvaita Vedanta is grounded in the Upanishads . 
 = = = Vishishtadvaita = = = 
 The third school of Vedanta is the Vishishtadvaita , which was founded by Ramanuja . Ramanuja strenuously refuted Shankara 's works . <unk> is a synthetic philosophy bridging the monistic Advaita and theistic Dvaita systems of Vedanta .

 Several scholars have recognised parallels between the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato and that of the Upanishads , including their ideas on sources of knowledge , concept of justice and path to salvation , and Plato 's allegory of the cave . Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason , spirit and appetite , also bears resemblance to the three gunas in the Indian philosophy of Samkhya . 
 Based on these common features some scholars , most notably E.J. <unk> and M.L. West , have argued that the Ancient Greek philosophy was influenced by , and borrowed some core concepts from , the Upanishads . Various mechanisms for such a transmission of knowledge have been conjectured including Pythagoras traveling as far as India ; Indian philosophers visiting Athens and meeting Socrates ; Plato encountering the ideas when in exile in Syracuse ; or , <unk> through Persia . 
 However other scholars , such as Arthur <unk> Keith , J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia , believe that the two systems developed independently . They note that there is no historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting , and point out significant differences in the stage of development , orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems . Wadia writes that Plato 's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state . In contrast , Upanishadic focus was the individual , the self ( atman , soul ) , self @-@ knowledge , and the means of an individual 's moksha ( freedom , liberation in this life or after @-@ life ) . 
 = = Translations = = 
 The Upanishads have been translated into various languages including Persian , Italian , Urdu , French , Latin , German , English , Dutch , Polish , Japanese , Spanish and Russian . The Moghul Emperor Akbar 's reign ( 1556 – 1586 ) saw the first translations of the Upanishads into Persian . His great @-@ grandson , Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikoh , produced a collection called Oupanekhat in 1656 , wherein 50 Upanishads were translated from Sanskrit into Persian . 
 Anquetil Duperron , a French Orientalist received a manuscript of the Oupanekhat and translated the Persian version into French and Latin , publishing the Latin translation in two volumes in 1801 – 1802 as <unk> <unk> . The French translation was never published . The Latin version was the initial introduction of Upanishadic thought to Western scholars . However , according to Deussen , the Persian translators took great liberties in translating the text and at times changed the meaning . 
 The first Sanskrit to English translation of the Aitareya Upanishad was made by Colebrooke , in 1805 and the first English translation of the Kena Upanishad was made by <unk> Roy in 1816 . Colebrooke was aware of 170 Upanishads . <unk> 's catalog from 1985 , the Upaniṣad @-@ <unk> @-@ mahā @-@ <unk> lists 223 Upanishads . 
 The first German translation appeared in 1832 and Roer 's English version appeared in 1853 . However , Max Mueller 's 1879 and 1884 editions were the first systematic English treatment to include the 12 Principal Upanishads . Other major translations of the Upanishads have been by Robert Ernest Hume ( 13 Principal Upanishads ) , Paul Deussen ( 60 Upanishads ) , Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ( 18 Upanishads ) , and Patrick Olivelle ( 32 Upanishads in two books ) . 
 = = Reception in the West = = 
 The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer read the Latin translation and praised the Upanishads in his main work , The World as Will and Representation ( 1819 ) , as well as in his <unk> and <unk> ( 1851 ) . He found his own philosophy was in accord with the Upanishads , which taught that the individual is a manifestation of the one basis of reality . For Schopenhauer , that fundamentally real underlying unity is what we know in ourselves as " will " . Schopenhauer used to keep a copy of the Latin <unk> by his side and commented , 
 It has been the solace of my life , it will be the solace of my death . 
 Another German philosopher , Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling , praised the mystical and spiritual aspects of the Upanishads . Schelling and other philosophers associated with German idealism were dissatisfied with Christianity as propagated by churches . They were fascinated with the Vedas and the Upanishads . In the United States , the group known as the Transcendentalists were influenced by the German idealists . These Americans , such as Emerson and Thoreau , were not satisfied with traditional Christian mythology and therefore embraced Schelling 's interpretation of Kant 's Transcendental idealism , as well as his celebration of the romantic , exotic , mystical aspect of the Upanishads . As a result of the influence of these writers , the Upanishads gained renown in Western countries . 
 One of the great English @-@ language poets of the 20th century , T. S. Eliot , inspired by his reading of the Upanishads , based the final portion of his famous poem The Waste Land ( 1922 ) upon one of its verses . Erwin Schrödinger , the great quantum physicist said , 
 The multiplicity is only apparent . This is the doctrine of the Upanishads . And not of the Upanishads only . The mystical experience of the union with God regularly leads to this view , unless strong prejudices stand in the West . 
 Eknath <unk> , in translating the Upanishads , articulates how they 
 ... form snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness taken at various times by different observers and dispatched with just the barest kind of explanation . 
 Juan Mascaró states that the Upanishads represents for the Hindu approximately what the New Testament represents for the Christian , and that the message of the Upanishads can be summarized in the words , " the kingdom of God is within you " . 
 Paul Deussen in his review of the Upanishads , states that the texts emphasize Brahman @-@ Atman as something that can experienced , but not defined . This view of the soul and self are similar , states Deussen , to those found in the dialogues of Plato and elsewhere . The Upanishads insisted on oneness of soul , excluded all plurality , and therefore , all proximity in space , all succession in time , all interdependence as cause and effect , and all opposition as subject and object . Max Muller , in his review of the Upanishads , summarizes the lack of systematic philosophy and the central theme in the Upanishads as follows , 
 There is not what could be called a philosophical system in these Upanishads . They are , in the true sense of the word , guesses at truth , frequently contradicting each other , yet all tending in one direction . The key @-@ note of the old Upanishads is " know thyself , " but with a much deeper meaning than that of the <unk> <unk> of the Delphic Oracle . The " know thyself " of the Upanishads means , know thy true self , that which underlines thine Ego , and find it and know it in the highest , the eternal Self , the One without a second , which underlies the whole world .

 A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 2010 American slasher film directed by Samuel Bayer and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer as a remake of Wes Craven 's 1984 film of the same name , which revolves around a group of teenagers who are being stalked in their dreams by an enigmatic man named Freddy Krueger . 
 Michael Bay and Platinum Dunes produced the film for New Line Cinema , as an intention to reboot the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise , with the cast of Jackie Earle Haley , Kyle Gallner , Rooney Mara , Katie Cassidy , Thomas Dekker and Kellan Lutz . This production makes it the ninth installment of the franchise . The film was released by Warner Bros. on April 30 , 2010 with grossing $ 115 million against a production budget of $ 35 million . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Kris Fowles ( Katie Cassidy ) goes to the Springwood Diner to meet with her ex @-@ boyfriend , Dean Russell ( Kellan Lutz ) , who falls asleep at the table and meets a man covered in burn scars , wearing a red and green sweater , a fedora and a clawed glove on his hand . The burned man cuts Dean 's throat in the dream , but in reality it appears that Dean is cutting his own throat as his friend , waitress Nancy Holbrook ( Rooney Mara ) , looks on with Kris . At Dean 's funeral , Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children , but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school . Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die in her dreams . Jesse Braun ( Thomas Dekker ) , Kris 's ex @-@ boyfriend , shows up at her house to keep her company while she sleeps , but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered . Covered in her blood , Jesse runs to Nancy 's house to try to explain what happened and he learns that Nancy has been having dreams about the same man : Freddy Krueger ( Jackie Earle Haley ) . 
 Jesse is apprehended by the police under suspicion of murdering Kris , and is killed by Krueger when he falls asleep in his jail cell . With her friends dying , Nancy begins to question what everyone 's connection is to each other , given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years . Eventually , Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith ( Kyle Gallner ) discover that all of them attended the same preschool together . Nancy 's mother , Gwen ( Connie Britton ) , reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin that there was a gardener at the preschool , Fred Krueger , who abused Nancy and the rest of the kids . Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite , and that she came home one day telling her mother about a hidden space in Krueger 's room and the things he did to her there . Gwen claims Krueger skipped town before he was arrested . Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school . Nancy eventually discovers that all of the other kids have been killed , most of them in their sleep . Meanwhile , Quentin tries to accept that his nightmares are nothing more than repressed memories , but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger . Quentin sees everyone 's parents hunt down Krueger , and then burn him alive . Quentin and Nancy confront Quentin 's father , Alan Smith ( Clancy Brown ) , about murdering Krueger with no evidence that he had committed any crime . Thus , Nancy and Quentin believe that Krueger wants revenge on them for lying as children . As a result of their insomnia , Nancy and Quentin begin sporadically dreaming while they are still awake . To try to stop Krueger , they decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can . 
 On the way , Nancy falls asleep and is attacked by Krueger , but when Quentin wakes her up they discover she has pulled a piece of Krueger 's sweater out of the dreamworld and into reality . Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital for cuts on her arm ; there , he steals some adrenaline and a syringe to help them stay awake . Nancy and Quentin eventually make it to the preschool . Quentin uncovers Krueger 's hidden room and the evidence that proves Krueger was in fact abusing all of the children ; they realize that Krueger actually wants revenge on them for telling the truth . Nancy decides the only way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality . Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger , but he falls asleep and is attacked . Krueger then goes after Nancy , and explains that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that , when she finally fell asleep , she would no longer be able to wake up . While Nancy struggles with Krueger , Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy who pulls Krueger into reality . With Krueger distracted by Quentin , Nancy uses a broken paper cutter blade to cut Krueger 's gloved hand off , and then slice his throat . Afterward , Nancy torches the secret room , with Krueger 's body left inside , while she and Quentin leave . Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital ; Krueger suddenly appears in a mirror 's reflection and kills Nancy 's mother before pulling her body through the mirror while Nancy screams .

 A Nightmare on Elm Street was originally going to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes ' other remake , Friday the 13th , with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements from each of the films and creating a single storyline with them . Eventually , they decided to use Craven 's original storyline , and try to create a scarier film . That being , they decided to remove the one @-@ line quipping Freddy , who had become less scary and more comical over the years , and bring him back to a darker nature ; this included developing the character as a true child molester , something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead . 
 The decision was also made to bring Freddy 's physical appearance closer to that of an actual burn victim , and the use of computer @-@ generated imagery was used in certain sections of Haley 's face to further assist in that vision . A Nightmare on Elm Street was primarily filmed in Illinois because of the positive experience the producers of Platinum Dunes had when filming other films in the same area . 
 Robert Englund , who portrayed Krueger in the previous eight films , voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role . A Nightmare on Elm Street was officially released in North America on April 30 , 2010 , and later released in foreign markets on May 8 , 2010 . The film was met with primarily negative reviews from film critics , as well as audience members who scored the film a C + . Regardless , A Nightmare on Elm Street broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film . The film has brought in over $ 63 million at the domestic box office , and over $ 115 million worldwide .

 On January 29 , 2008 , Variety reported that Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes production company would be rebooting the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise with a remake of the original 1984 film . In an interview , producer Brad Fuller initially explained that they were following the same line they did with their Friday the 13th remake , by abandoning the things that made the character less scary — the film 's antagonist , Freddy Krueger , would not be " cracking jokes " as had become a staple of his character in later films — and focusing more on trying to craft a " horrifying movie " . Fuller expressed how everyone at the studio loved the concept of being killed if you fell asleep . The producer stated that the film would be a remake of the 1984 film , but clarified that they would be borrowing certain character deaths and dream sequences from the entire Nightmare series . 
 In February 2009 , The Hollywood Reporter announced that Samuel Bayer was hired to direct the film . According to New Line production chief Toby Emmerich , Michael Bay advocated heavily for Bayer 's hiring , as Bay , Bayer , and director David Fincher came up as commercial directors together . It is Bay 's opinion that Bayer had " the ability to capture the kind of seductive and unsettling imagery that would make Nightmare feel like a fresh , visually arresting moviegoing experience " . Bayer declined Platinum Dunes ' offer ; twice . It was not until Bay sent the director an email " talking about the business " , and explaining what kind of opportunity it would be for Bayer that he finally agreed . 
 In a June 9 , 2009 interview , Craven expressed his displeasure in the remaking of his 1984 film , primarily because the filmmakers chose not to have him as a consultant to the film , unlike with the 2009 remake The Last House on the Left where he " shepherd [ ed ] it towards production " . In contrast , Robert Englund , who portrayed Freddy throughout the film series , felt it was time for A Nightmare on Elm Street to be remade . Englund liked the idea of being able to " exploit the dreamscape " with CGI and other technologies that did not exist when Craven was making the original Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984 . Subsequently , Bayer believed that the film is designed to pay homage to what Craven did in 1984 , but not replicate it entirely . Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films , and that the character of Freddy Krueger was one that affected the lives of a certain generation of people . For Bayer , remaking A Nightmare on Elm Street was about bringing that feeling to a new generation , with a new spin on the character and story . 
 Fuller and Form likened the new Nightmare film to their 2003 remake of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre , and retracted an earlier statement when they said they did not plan to " cherry pick " the best elements of the franchise , like they did with the reboot of the Friday the 13th franchise they released in 2009 . Instead , the 2010 film is more of a reimagining . The pair also explained that A Nightmare on Elm Street would have a different tone than the Friday the 13th remake . Form states , " I think a Friday the 13th movie like we made was really fun . You know , sex , drugs and rock and roll , and I think a Nightmare movie is not that . " 
 When asked why New Line was rebooting the Nightmare on Elm Street film series , Emmerich explained , " The Nightmare films are profoundly disturbing on a deep , human level because they 're about our dreams . It 's why we thought that we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film , since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture . " Overall , Bayer wanted to create a darker Nightmare on Elm Street , one he felt would fit into what he describes as " a darker world " . Bayer said there is subtext within the film , which is designed to get the audience to ask , " What makes a monster ? " Bayer wants the audience to think about whether a monster is something that exists purely from a physical appearance — someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove on their hand — or can a monster be something that is deeper , and within the man himself without a scarred face and bladed glove ? 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Wesley Strick was initially hired to pen a script for a new Nightmare on Elm Street , after he impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film Seven ; the film was never produced . Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick 's script before the film moved into production . When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of Strick and Heisserer , and which still " needed to be tinkered with " . Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into " [ Freddy ] as a person [ and ] how he became the thing he was " . Bayer expressed that , unlike the Friday the 13th remake that picked the best parts from the first four films , the Nightmare remake is coming straight from the first film . At one point there was a scene in an early draft of the script where some characters were playing Guitar Hero . Fuller explained that the scene was removed to keep the film from feeling dated . To him , if someone watched the film five years later , and Guitar Hero was not as popular as it once was , it would automatically make the film feel more dated upon viewing . At the same time , they wanted the film to feel relevant , and including things like the Internet , mobile phones , and text messaging would give the film a more timeless feel . 
 For the remake , Freddy was brought back to his darker roots and away from the comical character he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels . Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one @-@ liners , but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen . In addition , it was decided to follow Craven 's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester . The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason . It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out , whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened . In an effort to keep the story fresh , Heisserer developed the concept of micro @-@ naps . In the story , as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro @-@ naps , which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake . The micro @-@ naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream .

 In February 2009 , The Hollywood Reporter revealed Robert Englund would not reprise the role of Freddy Krueger for the remake ; Englund had performed the role for the eight previous films . On April 3 , 2009 Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackie Earle Haley was cast to take over Englund 's most well @-@ known role . Initially , the studio wanted to cast an unknown for the role of Freddy Krueger , but it was Haley 's performance in Little Children that impressed Emmerich enough to cast the actor against the original intentions . Emmerich explained , " Freddy is this incredible stew of malevolence and anger , but he also has a hint of vulnerability , and Jackie really has all of that and more . He just seemed completely right for the part . " Bayer stated that he and producers Form and Fuller managed to acquire the screen test Haley gave as Rorschach for Watchmen ; after viewing it , Bayer said it " blew [ his ] mind " , and that he knew Haley would be able to go deep and create a believable character who was a " [ psychopath ] with a burned face and a claw " . 
 Haley said the first time he heard his name mentioned in conjunction with the character was from people suggesting his casting on the internet , which he appreciated , and then later learned that his agents were already in talks with Brad Fuller . Haley stated that he was apprehensive about taking on the role of a character with such a dark past — that of a child murderer — for about a " minute and a half " . Knowing the Freddy Krueger in the remake would be even darker , Haley came to the realization quickly that at the end of the day he is doing a horror film , and this is just a fictional character . Haley said that once he embraced the idea of Freddy just being a " mythical boogeyman " , it became " very freeing " for him as an actor . 
 Haley is contracted for three films , which includes the remake and two sequels . Englund stated he agreed with the casting of Haley , noting that he feels Haley 's physical size works for him in this role . Explaining why they chose to take away the comical aspect of Freddy 's personality , Form and Fuller stated , " We 've never been attracted to a jokey antagonist because it feels less scary and less real " . Even though the character is closer to how he was portrayed in the original film , Haley has stated that he does not intend to have Englund 's performances influence his own . Haley stated that he used the frustration of having to sit in the make @-@ up chair for three and a half hours as his motivation to get into character . 
 Rooney Mara plays the role of Nancy Holbrook ; Mara is also contracted for a sequel . Bayer describes Nancy as " the loneliest girl in the world " . Mara stated that her Nancy is different than the role of Nancy Thompson , performed by Heather <unk> , and described her character as " socially awkward and timid and really doesn 't know how to connect with people " . Kyle Gallner was cast as Quentin , who forms a connection with Nancy . Gallner described his character as " a mess , more jittery and more ' out there ' than Nancy is " . Gallner pointed out that his character is like this because of the amount of pharmaceuticals he ingests to stay awake . Producer Brad Fuller commented that Gallner brought a sense of " humanity and relatability " to the role with his compassion and intellect . Other cast members include Katie Cassidy , Thomas Dekker , and Kellan Lutz . Cassidy performed the role of Kris . According to Cassidy , Kris becomes an emotional wreck throughout the film . Cassidy described her character 's ordeal : " She is literally dragged through hell , having to crawl through dark , claustrophobic tunnels . She 's always crying and freaking out as her nightmares of Freddy bleed into her everyday life . Kris suspects there 's something that connects her with the others ; she even confronts her mother about it , but no one 's talking . " 
 Dekker portrays Jesse , Kris 's ex @-@ boyfriend . According to Dekker , " Jesse kind of knows what 's going on but refuses to believe it . " Dekker explained that Jesse spends so much time trying to convince himself that Freddy is not real , that by the time he does meet Freddy face @-@ to @-@ face , " he 's just a mess .. [ ... ] There 's no bravado about it . His terror is very real . " Lutz plays Dean , Kris 's current boyfriend and " a well @-@ liked , well @-@ off high school jock " . Connie Britton and Clancy Brown also star . Gallner and Mara explained that the teenagers in the remake are " a little more aware " of Freddy and their situation , whereas in the original Gallner and Mara characterized Nancy and her friends as " more mellow " and " nonchalant " about their situation until they were finally killed .

 Discussing his physical appearance , Form and Fuller explained that Freddy would be more similar to a real burn victim . Form later clarified that there was a fine line they did not want to cross when it came to making Freddy look like a true burn victim . According to the producer , the crew had many reference photos of actual victims , which detailed how white the skin would appear after healing . Form did not want the audience to turn away in disgust every time Freddy was on the screen , so they opted to hold back on some of the realism . Fuller noted how horrific the images were , and how difficult they were to look at . The special effects crew that worked on The Dark Knight , creating the computer @-@ generated images ( CGI ) for Two @-@ Face 's face , were brought in to work on the minimal CGI used for Freddy 's face . The CGI is used in conjunction with the special effects make @-@ up that Haley wears . The prosthetics used to create Freddy 's physical look were designed by Andrew Clement . Haley described the experience of wearing all of the prosthetics and make @-@ up as " pretty encumbering " . 
 When production first started , Clement and his crew would spend six hours applying Haley 's make @-@ up ; eventually , the crew was able to streamline their process . According to Haley , the make @-@ up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him , from his head all the way down his back , which were glued to his body . The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance . Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make @-@ up chair to apply the prosthetics , each day ; on occasion , it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap , which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head . Haley also had to wear contact lenses , one that was bloody and another that was cloudy , with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of . Haley also had to work on developing Freddy 's " voice " for the film . According to Haley , the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is " this organic process of embodying the character " , and not about just " sitting around the table and going , ' Let me try this voice and this voice ' " . Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a " supernatural quality " and get it away from the voice Haley used as Rorschach in Watchmen .

 With a budget of $ 35 million , principal photography began on May 5 , 2009 and officially wrapped on July 10 , 2009 . Platinum Dunes chose to film in Illinois because of pleasurable filming experiences in the state when the company produced The Amityville Horror and The Unborn . Platinum Dunes also received a thirty percent tax break for filming in the state . For a representation of human version of Krueger , the producers were looking for locations that were " old and decaying " . They settled on the Ryerson Steel warehouse on the West Side of Chicago . The warehouse became the central location for the scenes involving the townspeople burning Krueger alive . 
 New Line contracted with two high schools in Illinois , Elk Grove High School and John Hersey High School , to use their location for scenes in the remake . According to Principal Nancy Holman , of Elk Grove High , the studio contacted schools across the nation looking for one that had a swimming pool . Although filming took place at both schools , neither was identified by name . The studio also cast 200 extras for various school scenes , including one in the pool , but required that all auditioning students be at least 16 years old . School board President Lenore Gonzales <unk> was initially apprehensive about the deal , as she disliked the idea of the studio filming " scenes of violence " at the schools ; <unk> agreed to the filming after being assured that no one would be killed during the swimming scenes . 
 On May 22 , 2009 , the Nightmare on Elm Street film crew went on location to the city of Gary , Indiana to film scenes at a Methodist church . The studio negotiated with the city for months before finally settling on a deal . According to Ben Clement , the executive director of the Gary Office of Film and Television , the studio was looking for " an architectural style that would fit the storyline of the film " . The film crew returned to Gary in June to film a dream sequence that takes place on Elm Street in one of the local streets , and in December some new scenes were shot in a diner , with new characters . 
 According to Fuller and Form , Warner Bros. suggested A Nightmare on Elm Street be released in 3 @-@ D , with the recent surge in 3 @-@ D films showing increased box office revenue . In the opinion of the Platinum Dunes producers , if a film is not initially conceived as 3 @-@ D then it should not be converted to 3 @-@ D. In other words , given that the original Nightmare on Elm Street was not a 3 @-@ D film , Fuller and Form fought with the studio to keep the remake from being converted to 3 @-@ D. The producers note that at the end of the day , Warner Bros. and Platinum Dunes came to the agreement that presenting the film in 3 @-@ D would not be presenting " the best version of the movie " .

 Based on 170 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , A Nightmare on Elm Street holds a 15 % overall approval rating from critics , with an average score of 3 @.@ 7 out of 10 . The consensus at Rotten Tomatoes was that the film was " visually faithful but lacking the depth and subversive twists that made the original so memorable , the Nightmare on Elm Street remake lives up to its title in the worst possible way . " By comparison , Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , calculated an average score of 35 , based on 25 reviews . CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was a " C + " on an A + to F scale , with exit polls showing that audiences were evenly divided between males and females , with 40 % between 18 – 24 years of age and 20 % under 18 . Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave it a " B – " and concluded that , " I did jump a few times , and I liked Haley 's dour malevolence , but overall , the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by @-@ the @-@ numbers bad dream that plays a little too much like a corporately ordered rerun . One , two , Freddy 's coming for you . Three , four , we 've been there before " . Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it " lethargically lifeless " and criticized Haley 's portrayal of Krueger , saying , " Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory , there 's just no replacing Englund " . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film 1 star out of 4 , writing in his review , " I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation . The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced , haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy . So what ? Are we supposed to be scared ? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response ? " . 
 On January 5 , 2011 , the film won the People 's Choice Award for " Best Horror Film " .

 = Klemens von Metternich = 
 Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich ( German : Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar , Fürst von Metternich @-@ Winneburg zu Beilstein , Anglicized as Clement Wenceslaus Lothair , Prince of Metternich @-@ Winneburg @-@ Beilstein ; 15 May 1773 – 11 June 1859 ) was a politician and statesman of Rhenish extraction and one of the most important diplomats of his era , serving as the Austrian Empire 's Foreign Minister from 1809 and Chancellor from 1821 until the liberal revolutions of 1848 forced his resignation . 
 One of his first tasks was to engineer a détente with France that included the marriage of Napoleon to the Austrian archduchess Marie Louise . Soon after , he engineered Austria 's entry into the War of the Sixth Coalition on the Allied side , signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau that sent Napoleon into exile , and led the Austrian delegation at the Congress of Vienna that divided post @-@ Napoleonic Europe amongst the major powers . For his service to the Austrian Empire he was given the title of Prince in October 1813 . Under his guidance , the " Metternich system " of international congresses continued for another decade as Austria aligned herself with Russia and , to a lesser extent , Prussia . This marked the high point of Austria 's diplomatic importance , and thereafter Metternich slowly slipped into the periphery of international diplomacy . At home , Metternich held the post of Chancellor of State from 1821 until 1848 , under both Francis I and his son Ferdinand I. After brief exile in London , Brighton , and Brussels that lasted until 1851 , he returned to the Viennese court , this time to offer only advice to Ferdinand 's successor , Franz Josef . Having outlived his generation of politicians , Metternich died at the age of 86 in 1859 . 
 Born into the House of Metternich in 1773 , the son of a diplomat , he was named after his godfather , Clement @-@ Wenceslas , Archbishop of Trier . Metternich received a good education at the universities of Strasbourg and Mainz . He was of help during the coronation of Francis II in 1792 and that of his predecessor , Leopold II , in 1790 . After a brief trip to England , Metternich was named as the Austrian ambassador to the Netherlands , a short @-@ lived post , since the country was brought under French control the next year . He married his first wife , Eleonore von Kaunitz ( a descendant of Karolina of Legnica @-@ Brieg ) , in 1795 , which aided his entry into Viennese society . Despite having numerous affairs , he was devastated by her death in 1825 . He would later remarry , wedding Baroness Antoinette <unk> in 1827 and , after her death in 1829 , Countess Melanie Zichy @-@ Ferraris in 1831 . She would predecease him by five years . Before taking office as Foreign Minister , Metternich held numerous smaller posts , including ambassadorial roles in the Kingdom of Saxony , the Kingdom of Prussia and Napoleonic France . One of Metternich 's sons , Richard von Metternich , was also a successful diplomat ; many of Metternich 's twelve other acknowledged children predeceased him . A traditional conservative , Metternich was keen to maintain the balance of power , in particular by resisting Russian territorial ambitions in Central Europe and lands belonging to the Ottoman Empire . He disliked liberalism and worked to prevent the breakup of the Austrian empire , for example , by crushing nationalist revolts in Austrian north Italy and the German states . At home , he pursued a similar policy , using censorship and a wide ranging spy network to suppress unrest . 
 Metternich has been both praised and heavily criticised for the policies he pursued . His supporters point out that he presided over the " Age of Metternich " , when international diplomacy helped prevent major wars in Europe . His qualities as a diplomat are commended , some noting that his achievements were considerable in light of the weakness of his negotiating position . His decision to oppose Russian imperialism is seen as a good one . His detractors describe him as a boor who stuck to ill @-@ thought @-@ out , conservative principles out of vanity and a sense of infallibility . They argue he could have done much to secure Austria 's future ; instead , his 1817 proposals for administrative reform were largely rejected , and his opposition to German nationalism is blamed for Germany 's unification under Prussia and not Austria . Other historians have argued that he had far less power than this view suggests and that his policies were only exercised when they were in accord with the views of Austria 's Habsburg monarchy . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Klemens Metternich was born into the House of Metternich on 15 May 1773 to Franz George Karl Count Metternich @-@ Winneburg zu Beilstein , a diplomat who had passed from the service of the Archbishopric of Trier to that of the Imperial court , and his wife Countess Maria Beatrice <unk> von <unk> ( alternatively von <unk> ) . He was named in honour of Prince Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony , the archbishop @-@ elector of Trier and the past employer of his father . He was the eldest son and had one older sister . At the time of his birth the family possessed a ruined keep at Beilstein , a castle at <unk> , an estate west of Koblenz , and another in Königswart , Bohemia , won during the 17th century . At this time Metternich 's father , described as " a boring babbler and chronic liar " by a contemporary , was the Austrian ambassador to the courts of the three Rhenish electors ( Trier , Cologne and Mainz ) . Metternich 's education was handled by his mother , heavily influenced by their proximity to France ; for many years Metternich considered himself able to communicate better in French than German . As a child he went on official visits with his father and , under the direction of Protestant tutor John Frederick Simon , was tutored in academic subjects , swimming , and horsemanship . 
 In the summer of 1788 Metternich began studying law at the University of Strasbourg , matriculating on 12 November . While a student he was for some time accommodated by Prince Maximilian of Zweibrücken , the future King of Bavaria . At this time he was described by Simon as " happy , handsome and lovable " , though contemporaries would later recount how he had been a liar and a braggart . Metternich left Strasbourg in September 1790 to attend Leopold II 's October coronation in Frankfurt , where he performed the largely honorific role of Ceremonial Marshall to the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia . There , under the wing of his father , he met with the future Francis II and looked at ease among the attendant nobility . 
 Between the end of 1790 and summer of 1792 Metternich studied law at the University of Mainz , receiving a more conservative education than at Strasbourg , a city the return to which was now unsafe . In the summers he worked with his father , who had been appointed plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands . In March 1792 Francis succeeded his father Leopold as Holy Roman Emperor and was crowned in July , affording Metternich a reprisal of his earlier role of Ceremonial Marshall . To this he added the honour of opening the accompanying ball alongside Louise of Mecklenburg . In the meantime France had declared war on Austria , beginning the War of the First Coalition ( 1792 – 7 ) and making Metternich 's further study in Mainz impossible . Now in the employment of his father , he was sent on a special mission to the front . Here he led the interrogation of the French Minister of War the Marquis de Beurnonville and several accompanying National Convention commissioners . Metternich observed the siege and fall of Valenciennes , later looking back on these as substantial lessons about warfare . In early 1794 he was sent to England on , ostensibly on official business helping Viscount <unk> , the Treasurer @-@ General of the Austrian Netherlands , to negotiate a loan . 
 = = Marriage and the Congress of Rastatt = = 
 In England he met the King on several occasions and dined with a number of influential British politicians , including William Pitt , Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke . Metternich was nominated the new Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands and left England in September 1794 . Unfortunately , he found an exiled and powerless government in headlong retreat from the latest French advance . In October a revitalised French army swept into Germany and annexed all of the Metternich estates except Königswart . Disappointed , and affected by strong criticism of his father 's policies , he joined his parents in Vienna in November . On 27 September 1795 he married Countess Eleonore von Kaunitz , a granddaughter of former Austrian chancellor Wenzel Kaunitz . The marriage was arranged by Metternich 's mother and introduced him to Viennese society . This was undoubtedly part of the motivation for Metternich , who demonstrated less affection for her than she for him . Two conditions were imposed by the father of the bride , Prince Kaunitz : first , the still youthful Eleonore was to continue to live at home ; and second , Metternich was forbidden from serving as a diplomat as long as the Prince was still alive . Their daughter Maria was born in January 1797 . 
 After Metternich 's studies in Vienna , the Prince 's death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to participate in the Congress of Rastatt . Initially his father took him as a secretary while ensuring that , when proceedings officially started in December 1797 , he was named the representative of the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia . A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down . During this period Eleonore had chosen to live with Metternich at Rastatt and gave birth to sons Francis ( February 1798 ) and , shortly after the end of the Congress , Klemens ( June 1799 ) . Much to Metternich 's anguish Klemens died after only a few days , and Francis soon contracted a lung infection from which he would never recover .

 The Holy Roman Empire 's defeat in the War of the Second Coalition shook up diplomatic circles , and the promising Metternich was now offered a choice between three ministerial positions : to the Imperial Diet at Regensburg ; to the Kingdom of Denmark at Copenhagen ; or to the Elector of Saxony at Dresden . He chose Dresden in late January 1801 , and his appointment was officially announced in February . Metternich summered in Vienna , where he wrote his " Instructions " , a memorandum showing much greater understanding of statesmanship than his earlier writing . He visited the Königswart estate in the autumn before taking up his new position on 4 November . The subtleties of the memorandum were lost on the Saxon court , which was headed by the retiring Frederick Augustus , a man with little political initiative . Despite the boredom of the court , Metternich enjoyed the light @-@ hearted frivolity of the city and took up a mistress , Katharina Bagration , who bore him a daughter , <unk> . In January 1803 Metternich and his wife had a child whom they named Viktor . In Dresden Metternich also made a number of important contacts including Friedrich <unk> , a publicist who would serve Metternich as both confidant and critic for the next thirty years . He also established links with important Polish and French political figures . 
 The Imperial Recess of 1803 brought Metternich 's family new estates in <unk> , the title of Prince , and a seat in the Imperial Diet . In the ensuing diplomatic reshuffle Metternich was appointed ambassador to the Kingdom of Prussia , being notified of this in February 1803 and taking his position in November of that year . He arrived at a critical juncture in European diplomacy , soon growing worried about the territorial ambitions of Napoleon Bonaparte , newly the leader of France . This fear was shared by the Russian court under Alexander I , and the Tsar kept Metternich informed of Russian policy . By autumn of 1804 Vienna decided on action entered into in August 1805 when the Austrian Empire ( as the Holy Roman Empire was in the process of becoming ) began its involvement in the War of the Third Coalition . Metternich 's now almost impossible task was to convince Prussia to join the coalition against Bonaparte . Their eventual agreement was not due to Metternich , however , and after the coalition 's defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz , Prussia disregarded the agreement and signed a treaty with the French instead . 
 = = = Paris = = = 
 In the ensuing reshuffle in Vienna Johann Philipp Stadion became the Austrian foreign minister , freeing Metternich to assume the post of Ambassador to the Russian Empire . He never made it to Russia , as need had arisen for a new Austrian at the French court . Metternich was approved for the post in June 1806 . He enjoyed being in demand and was happy to be sent to France on a generous salary of 90 @,@ 000 gulden a year . After an arduous trip he took up residence in August 1806 , being briefed by Baron von Vincent and Engelbert von <unk> , whom he would retain as a close adviser for two decades . He met French foreign minister Charles Talleyrand on 5 August and Napoleon himself five days later at Saint @-@ Cloud ; soon , the War of the Fourth Coalition drew both Talleyrand and Napoleon eastwards . Metternich 's wife and children joined him in October , and he went into society , using his charm to win great eminence there . The presence of Eleonore did not prevent him from a series of affairs that certainly included Napoleon 's sister Caroline Murat , Laure Junot , and perhaps many besides . 
 After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich saw that Austria 's position in Europe was much more vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last . In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister , Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement over the future of several French forts on the River Inn . Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy , and Metternich 's own reputation , increased . Metternich pushed for a Russo @-@ Austrian alliance , though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit . Over time , Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable . 
 In a memorable event , Metternich argued with Napoleon at Napoleon 's 39th birthday celebrations in August 1808 over the increasingly obvious preparations for war on both sides . Soon after , Napoleon refused Metternich 's attendance at the Congress of Erfurt ; Metternich was later glad to hear from Talleyrand that Napoleon 's attempts at the Congress to get Russia to invade Austria had proved unsuccessful . In late 1808 Metternich was recalled to Vienna for five weeks of meetings about the possibility of Austria invading France while Napoleon was on campaign in Spain . His memoranda reported that France was not united behind Napoleon , that Russia was unlikely to want to fight Austria , and that France had few reliable troops that could fight in central Europe . Back in Paris , Metternich was overtly apprehensive about his own safety . When Austria declared war on France , Metternich was indeed arrested in retaliation for the arrest of two French diplomats in Vienna , but the effects of this were minimal . He was allowed to leave France under escort for Austria in late May 1809 . After Napoleon 's capture of Vienna Metternich was conducted to the Austrian capital and exchange there for the French diplomats . 
 = = Foreign Minister = = 
 = = = Détente with France = = = 
 Now back in Austria , Metternich witnessed first hand the Austrian army 's defeat at the Battle of Wagram . Stadion tendered his resignation as Foreign Minister in the aftermath , and the Emperor immediately offered the post to Metternich . Metternich , worried that Napoleon would seize on this to demand harsher peace terms , instead agreed to become a minister of state ( which he did on 8 July ) and to lead negotiations with the French on the understanding that he would replace Stadion as Foreign Minister at a later date . During peace talks at Altenburg , Metternich put forward pro @-@ French proposals to save the Austrian monarchy . Napoleon , however , disliked his position on the future of Poland , and Metternich was gradually displaced from the proceedings by Prince Liechtenstein . He soon regained influence , however , on 8 October , as Foreign Minister ( and additionally that of Minister of the Imperial Household ) . In early 1810 Metternich 's earlier affair with Junot became public but , because of Eleonore 's understanding , the scandal was minimal . 
 One of Metternich 's first tasks was to push for the marriage of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise rather than to the Tsar 's youngest sister Anna Pavlovna . Metternich would later seek to distance himself from the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon 's own idea , but this is improbable ; in any case , he was happy to claim responsibility at the time . By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March . Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed by a different route and unofficially . The trip was designed , Metternich explained , to transport his family ( stranded in France by the outbreak of war ) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise 's activities . 
 Instead , Metternich stayed six months , entrusting his office in Vienna to his father . He set about using the marriage , and flattery , to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn . The concessions he won were trivial , however : a few trading rights , delay in the payment of the war indemnity , restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service , including the Metternich family 's , and the lifting of a 150 @,@ 000 man limit on the Austrian army . The last was particularly welcomed as a sign of increased Austrian independence , although Austria could no longer afford an army greater than the limit prescribed . 
 = = = = As France 's ally = = = = 
 When Metternich returned to Vienna in October 1810 , he was no longer as popular . His influence was limited to foreign affairs , and his attempts to get a full Council of State reintroduced had failed . Convinced that a much weakened Austria should avoid another invasion by France , he rejected the advances of Tsar Alexander and instead concluded an alliance with Napoleon on 14 March 1812 . He also supported a period of moderate censorship , aimed at preventing provocation of the French . Requiring that only 30 @,@ 000 Austrian troops fight alongside the French , the alliance treaty was more generous than the one Prussia had signed a month earlier ; this allowed Metternich to give both Britain and Russia assurances that Austria remained committed to curbing Napoleonic ambitions . He accompanied his sovereign for a final meeting with Napoleon at Dresden in May 1812 before Napoleon the French invasion of Russia . 
 The Dresden meeting revealed that Austria 's influence in Europe had reached its lowest point , and Metternich was now bent on re @-@ establishing that influence by using what he considered strong ties with all sides in the war , proposing general peace talks headed by Austria . Over the next three months , he would slowly distance Austria from the French cause , while avoiding alliance with either Prussia or Russia , and remaining open to any proposal that would secure a place for the combined Bonaparte @-@ Habsburg dynasty . This was driven by concern that if Napoleon were defeated , Russia and Prussia would stand to gain too much . Napoleon was intransigent , however , and the fighting ( now officially the War of the Sixth Coalition ) continued . Austria 's alliance with France ended in February 1813 , and Austria then moved to a position of armed neutrality . 
 = = = = As a neutral = = = = 
 Metternich was much less keen on turning against France than many of his contemporaries ( though not the Emperor ) , and he favoured his own plans for a general settlement . In November 1813 he offered Napoleon the Frankfurt proposals , which would allow Napoleon to remain Emperor but would reduce France to its " natural frontiers " and undo its control of most of Italy , Germany , and the Netherlands . Napoleon , expecting to win the war , delayed too long and lost this opportunity ; by December the Allies had withdrawn the offer . By early 1814 , as they were closing in on Paris , Napoleon agreed to the Frankfurt proposals , too late , and he rejected the new , harsher terms then proposed . 
 Nevertheless , the Allies were not faring well , and although a statement of general war aims that included many nods to Austria was secured from Russia , Britain remained distrustful and generally unwilling to give up the military initiative she had fought 20 years to establish . Despite this , Francis created the Austrian Foreign Minister Grand @-@ Chancellor of the Order of Maria Theresa , a post which had been vacant since the time of Kaunitz . Metternich increasingly worried that Napoleon 's retreat would bring with it disorder that would harm the Habsburgs . A peace had to be concluded soon , he believed . Since Britain could not be coerced , he sent proposals to France and Russia only . These were rejected , though after the battles of Lützen ( 2 May ) and Bautzen ( 20 – 21 May ) , a French @-@ initiated truce was called . Starting in April Metternich began to " slowly and reluctantly " prepare Austria for war with France ; the armistice provided Austria time for fuller complete mobilisation . 
 In June Metternich left Vienna to personally handle negotiations at <unk> in Bohemia . When he arrived he benefitted from the hospitality of Princess Wilhelmine , Duchess of Sagan and began an affair with her that lasted several months . No other mistress ever achieved such influence over Metternich as Wilhelmine , and he would continue to write to her after their separation . Meanwhile , French Foreign Minister Hugues @-@ Bernard <unk> remained elusive , though Metternich did manage to discuss the state of affairs with the Tsar on 18 – 19 June at <unk> . In talks which would later be ratified as the Reichenbach Convention they agreed on general peace demands and set out a process by which Austria could enter the war on the Coalition side . Shortly afterwards Metternich was invited to join Napoleon at Dresden , where he could put the terms directly . Though no reliable record of their meeting on 26 June 1813 exists , it seems it was a stormy but effective meeting . Agreement was finally reached as Metternich was about to leave : peace talks would start in Prague in July and run until 20 August . In agreeing to this Metternich had ignored the Reichenbach Convention , and this angered Austria 's Coalition allies . The Conference of Prague would never properly meet , since Napoleon gave his representatives Armand Caulaincourt and the Count of Narbonne insufficient powers to negotiate . At the informal discussions held in lieu of the conference , Caulaincourt implied that Napoleon would not negotiate until an allied army threatened France itself . This convinced Metternich , and , after an ultimatum Metternich issued to France went unheeded , Austria declared war on 12 August . 
 = = = = As a coalition partner = = = = 
 Austria 's allies saw the declaration as an admission that Austria 's diplomatic ambitions had failed , but Metternich viewed it as one move in a much longer campaign . For the rest of the war he strove to hold the Coalition together and , as such , to curb Russians momentum in Europe . To this end he won an early victory as an Austrian general , the Prince of Schwarzenberg , was confirmed supreme commander of the Coalition forces rather than Tsar Alexander I. He also succeeded in getting the three allied monarchs ( Alexander , Francis and Prussia 's Frederick William III ) to follow him and their armies on campaign . With the Treaties of Teplitz , Metternich allowed Austria to remain uncommitted over the future of France , Italy , and Poland . He was still confined , however , by the British , who were subsidizing Prussia and Russia ( in September Metternich requested subsidies for Austria as well ) . Meanwhile , the Coalition forces took the offensive . On 18 October 1813 Metternich witnessed the successful Battle of Leipzig and , two days later , he was rewarded for his " wise direction " with the rank of prince ( German : Fürst ) . Metternich was delighted when Frankfurt was retaken in early November and , in particular , by the deference the Tsar showed Francis at a ceremony organised there by Metternich . <unk> , with the war drawing to a close , he remained determined to prevent the creation of a strong , unified German state , even offering Napoleon generous terms in order to retain him as a counterweight . On 2 December 1813 Napoleon agreed to talk , though these talks were delayed by the need for the participation of a more senior British diplomat , ( Viscount Castlereagh ) . 
 Before talks could begin , Coalition armies crossed the Rhine on 22 December . Metternich retired from Frankfurt to Breisgau to celebrate Christmas with his wife 's family before travelling to the new Coalition headquarters at Basel in January 1814 . Quarrels with Tsar Alexander , particularly over the fate of France intensified in January , prompting Alexander to storm out . He therefore missed the arrival of Castlereagh in mid @-@ January . Metternich and Castlereagh formed a good working relationship and then met with Alexander at Langres . The Tsar remained unaccommodating however , demanding a push into the centre of France ; fortunately , he was too preoccupied to object to Metternich 's other ideas , like a final peace conference in Vienna . Metternich did not attend talks with the French at <unk> , as he wanted to stay with Alexander . The talks stalled , and , after a brief advance , Coalition forces had to retreat after the Montmirail and Montereau . This relieved Metternich 's fears that an overconfident Alexander might act unilaterally . 
 Metternich continued negotiations with the French envoy Caulaincourt through early to mid March 1814 , when victory at the Laon put the Coalition back on the offensive . By this time Metternich was tiring of trying to hold the Coalition together , and even the British @-@ engineered Treaty of Chaumont did not help . In the absence of the Prussians and Russians the Coalition agreed to the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty . Francis rejected a final plea from Napoleon that he abdicate in favour of his wife , and Paris fell on 30 March . Military manoeuvres had forced Metternich westward to Dijon on 24 March and now , after deliberate delay , he left for the French capital on 7 April . On 10 April he found a city at peace and , much to his annoyance , largely in the control of Tsar Alexander . The Austrians disliked the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau that Russian had imposed on Napoleon in their absence , but Metternich was reluctant to oppose them and on 11 April signed the treaty . Thereafter he focused on safeguarding Austrian interests in the forthcoming peace ; asserting Austria 's influence in Germany over that of Prussia ; and undoing Russian ascendancy . For these reasons he ensured that the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Venetia , lost to French client states in 1805 , were duly re @-@ annexed . 
 On the division of formerly French @-@ occupied Poland and Germany , Metternich was more confined by the interests of the Allies . After two failed proposals , advanced by the Prussians , the issue was postponed until after a peace treaty had been signed . Elsewhere , Metternich , like many of his counterparts , was anxious to provide the renewed French monarchy with the resources to suppress new revolution . The generous Treaty of Paris was signed on 30 May . Now free , Metternich accompanied Tsar Alexander to England ; Wilhelmine , who had followed Metternich to Paris , also made the crossing . A triumphant Metternich filled his four weeks with revelry , re @-@ establishing his reputation and that of Austria ; he was also awarded an honorary law degree from the University of Oxford . By contrast and to Metternich 's pleasure , Alexander was ill @-@ mannered and often insulting . Despite the opportunities , little diplomacy took place ; instead , all that was firmly agreed was that proper discussions would take place at Vienna , with a date tentatively set for 15 August . When the Tsar tried to postpone it to October Metternich agreed but effected conditions that prevented Alexander from exercising any advantage due to his de facto control of Poland . Metternich was eventually reunited with his family in Austria in the middle of July 1814 , having stopped for a week in France to sooth fears surrounding Napoleon 's wife Marie Louise , now the Duchess of Parma . His return to Vienna was celebrated by an occasional cantata that included the line " History holds thee up to posterity as a model among great men " . 
 = = = Congress of Vienna = = = 
 In the autumn of 1814 the heads of the five reigning dynasties and representatives from 216 noble families began gathering Vienna . Before ministers from the " Big Four " ( the Coalition allies of Britain , Austria , Prussia and Russia ) arrived , Metternich stayed quietly in Baden bei Wien , two hours to the south . When he heard they had reached Vienna he journeyed to meet them and encouraged them to go with him back to Baden . They declined , and four meetings were held in the city itself . In these , the representatives agreed on how the Congress would operate and , to Metternich 's delight , named his own aide Friedrich <unk> secretary to the negotiations of the " Big Six " ( the Big Four plus France and Spain ) . When Talleyrand and Spanish representative Don Pedro Labrador learned of these decisions , they were incensed that agreements were negotiated by the Big Four only . Sweden and Portugal were similarly angered by their exclusion from all but the full Congress , especially since Metternich was determined to give the latter as little power as possible . As a result , the Big Six became the Preliminary Committee of the Eight , whose first decision was that the congress itself be postponed to 1 November . In fact , it would soon be postponed again , with only a minor commission beginning work in November . In the meantime , Metternich organised a controversially vast array of entertainments for the delegates including himself . 
 Leaving Castlereagh to negotiate on Tsar Alexander 's behalf , Metternich briefly turned his attention to quelling anti @-@ Habsburg feeling in Italy . Around the same time , he learnt that the Duchess of Sagan was courting the Tsar . Disappointed , and exhausted by social rounds , Metternich let his guard drop , angering Tsar Alexander during negotiations over Poland ( then ruled by Napoleon as the Grand Duchy of Warsaw ) by implying Austria could match Russia militarily . The pair would never meet in person again . Despite the blunder , Francis refused to dismiss his foreign minister , and political crisis rocked Vienna throughout November , culminating in a declaration by Tsar Alexander that Russia would not compromise in her claim on Poland as a satellite kingdom . The Coalition rejected this utterly , and agreement seemed further off than ever . During the stand @-@ off , it seems that Alexander even went as far as to challenge Metternich to a duel . Fortunately for Metternich , Tsar Alexander soon did a rapid volte face and agreed to the division of Poland . He also softened in regard to the Germanic Kingdom of Saxony , and for the first time allowed Talleyrand to participate in all Big Four ( now Big Five ) discussions . 
 With the new consensus , the major issues concerning Poland and Germany were settled in the second week of February 1815 . Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony , but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany . Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal Diet that could stand up to Prussia . He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues , like navigation rights on the Rhine . The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy , where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army . On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia . Metternich wanted no rash change of course , and at first there was little impact on the Congress . Finally , on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting . On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150 @,@ 000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances . After the military commanders left , the Vienna Congress settled down to serious work , fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands , formalising proposals for a loose confederation of Swiss cantons , and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland . By late April only two major issues remained , the organisation of a new German federation and the problem of Italy . 
 The latter soon began to come to a head . Austria had solidified its control over Lombardy @-@ Venice and extended its protection to provinces nominally under the control of Francis ' daughter Marie Louise . On 18 April Metternich announced that Austria was formally at war with Murat 's Naples . Austria won the Battle of Tolentino on 3 May and captured Naples less than three weeks later . Metternich then was able to delay a decision on the future of the country until after Vienna . Discussions about Germany would drag on until early June , when a joint Austrian @-@ Prussian proposition was ratified . It left most constitutional issues to the new diet ; its President would be the Emperor Francis himself . Despite criticism from within Austria , Metternich was pleased with the outcome and the degree of control it granted Habsburgs , and , through them , himself . Certainly , Metternich was able to use the diet to his own ends on numerous occasions . The arrangement was similarly popular with most German representatives . A summation treaty was signed on 19 June ( the Russians signed a week later ) , bringing the Vienna Congress officially to an end . Metternich himself had left on 13 June for the front line , prepared for a lengthy war against Napoleon . Napoleon , however , was defeated decisively at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June . 
 = = = Paris and Italy = = = 
 On 15 June 1815 Metternich was with coalition allies in Paris , once more discussing peace terms , when he read that his son and two daughters had narrowly escaped death after a bridge collapsed . He disliked the enforced separation . After 133 days of negotiations , longer than the turmoil itself , the second Treaty of Paris was concluded on 20 November . Metternich , of the opinion that France should not be dismembered , was happy with the result : France lost only a little land along its eastern borders , seven hundred million French francs , and the artworks it had plundered . It also accepted an army of occupation numbering 150 @,@ 000 . In the meantime a separate treaty , proposed by Alexander and redrafted by Metternich , had been signed on 26 September . This created a new Holy Alliance centered on Russia , Prussia and Austria ; it was a document Metternich neither pushed for nor wanted , given its vaguely liberal sentiments . Representatives from most of the European states eventually signed , with the exception of the Pope , the United Kingdom , and the Ottoman Empire . Shortly afterwards , a separate treaty reaffirmed the Quadruple Alliance and established through its sixth article the Congress System of regular diplomatic meetings . With Europe at peace , the Austrian flag now flew over 50 % more land than when Metternich had become Foreign Minister . 
 Metternich now returned to the question of Italy , making his first visit to the country in early December 1815 . After visiting Venice , his family joined him in Milan on 18 December . For once it was Metternich playing the liberal , vainly urging Francis to give the region some autonomy . Metternich spent four months in Italy , endlessly busy and suffering chronic inflammation of the eyelids . He tried to control Austrian foreign policy from Milan and , when there was a serious disagreement between the Empire and the Kingdom of Bavaria , was heavily criticised for his absence . His enemies could not capitalise on this , however ; Stadion was occupied by his work as finance minister and the Empress Maria Ludovika , a fierce critic of Metternich 's policies , died in April . The uncharacteristic gap between the views of Metternich and his emperor was eased only by active compromise of proposals . Metternich returned to Vienna on 28 May 1816 after almost a year 's absence . Professionally , the rest of 1816 passed quietly for the tired Minister , who was concerned with fiscal policy and monitoring the spread of liberalism in Germany and nationalism in Italy . Personally , he was shaken in November by the death of Julie Zichy @-@ Festetics . Two years later he wrote that his " life ended there , " and his old frivolity took some time to return . The only consolation was July 's news that Metternich was to receive new estates along the Rhine at Johannisberg , only 25 miles ( 40 km ) from his birthplace at Koblenz . 
 In June 1817 Metternich was required to escort the emperor 's newly wed daughter Maria Leopoldina to a ship at Livorno . There was delay upon their arrival , and Metternich spent the time travelling around Italy again ; he visited Venice , Padua , Ferrara , Pisa , Florence and Lucca . Though alarmed by developments ( he noted that many of Francis ' concessions were still not in practice ) , he was optimistic and made another plea for decentralisation on 29 August . After this failed , Metternich decided to broaden his efforts into general administrative reform to avoid the appearance of favouring the Italians over the rest of the Empire . While working on this , he returned to Vienna on 12 September 1817 to be immediately caught up in the organisation his daughter Maria 's marriage to Count Joseph Esterházy just three days later . It proved too much , and Metternich was taken ill . After a delay for recovery , Metternich condensed his proposals for Italy into three documents he submitted to Francis , all dated 27 October 1817 . The administration would remain undemocratic , but there would be a new Ministry of Justice and four new chancellors — each with local remits , including one for " Italy " . Importantly , the divisions would be regional , not national . In the end , Francis accepted the revised proposals , albeit with several alterations and restrictions . 
 = = = Aachen , Teplice , Karlsbad , Troppau and Laibach = = = 
 Metternich 's primary focus remained on preserving unity among the Great Powers of Europe and hence his own power as mediator . He was also concerned by liberal @-@ minded Ioannis Kapodistrias ' increasing influence over Tsar Alexander and the continual threat of Russia annexing large areas of the declining Ottoman Empire ( the so @-@ called Eastern Question ) . As he had earlier envisaged , by April 1818 Britain had drawn up , and Metternich pushed through , proposals to have a Congress at Aachen , then a Prussian frontier town , six months later . Meanwhile , Metternich was advised to go to the spa town of Karlsbad to treat the rheumatic tension in his back . It was a pleasant month @-@ long trip , although it was there he received news of the death of his father at the age of 72 . He visited the family estate at Königswart and then Frankfurt in late August to encourage the member states of the German Confederation to agree on procedural issues . He could also now visit Koblenz for the first time in 25 years and his new estate at Johannisberg . Travelling with Emperor Francis , he was warmly greeted by the Catholic towns along the Rhine as he progressed towards Aachen . He had arranged in advance for newspapers to cover the first peacetime congress of its kind . As discussions began , Metternich pushed for the withdrawal of allied troops from France and means for preserving the unity of the European powers . The former was agreed almost immediately ; but on the latter agreement extended only to maintaining the Quadruple Alliance . Metternich rejected the Tsar 's idealistic plans for ( among other things ) a single European army . His own recommendations to the Prussians for greater controls on freedom of speech was equally hard for other powers such as Britain to support openly . 
 Metternich travelled with Dorothea Lieven to Brussels soon after the congress broke up , and although he could not stay more than a few days , the pair exchanged letters for the next eight years . He arrived in Vienna on 11 December 1818 and was finally able to spend considerable time with his children . He entertained the Tsar during the Christmas season and spent twelve weeks monitoring Italy and Germany before setting off with the Emperor on a third trip to Italy . The trip was cut short by the assassination of the conservative German dramatist August von Kotzebue . After a short delay , Metternich decided that if the German governments would not act against this perceived problem , Austria would have to compel them . He called an informal conference in Karlsbad and sounded out Prussian support beforehand by meeting with Frederick William III of Prussia in Teplice in July . Metternich carried the day , using a recent attempt on the life of the Chief Minister of Nassau , Carl <unk> to win agreement for the conservative program now known as the Convention of Teplitz . The Karlsbad conference opened on 6 August and ran for the rest of the month . Metternich overcame any opposition to his proposed " group of anti @-@ revolutionary measures , correct and <unk> " , although they were condemned by outsiders . Despite censure Metternich was very pleased with the result , known as the " Karlsbad Decrees " . 
 At the conference in Vienna later in the year , Metternich found himself constrained by the Princes of Württemberg and Bavaria to abandon his plans to reform the German federation . He now regretted having so quickly forced through its original constitution five years before . Nevertheless , he held ground on other issues and the Conference 's Final Act was highly reactionary , much as Metternich had envisaged it . He remained in Vienna until the close in May 1820 , finding the whole affair a bore . On 6 May he heard of the death of his daughter <unk> tuberculosis . Journeying on to Prague , he heard that his eldest daughter Maria had also contracted the disease . He was at her bedside in Baden bei Wien when she died on 20 July . This prompted Eleonore and the remaining children to leave for the cleaner air of France . The rest of 1820 was filled with liberal revolts to which Metternich was expected to respond . Ultimately , the Austrian Foreign Minister was torn between following through on his conservative pledge ( a policy favoured by the Russians ) and keeping out of a country in which Austria had no interest ( favoured by the British ) . He chose " sympathetic inactivity " on Spain but , much to his dismay and surprise , Guglielmo Pepe led a revolt in Naples in early July and forced King Ferdinand I to accept a new constitution . Metternich reluctantly agreed to attend the Russian @-@ initiated Congress of Troppau in October to discuss these events . He need not have worried : the Tsar gave way and accepted a compromise proposal of moderate interventionism . Still worried by Kapodistrias ' influence over the Tsar , he laid down his conservative principles in a long memorandum , including an attack the free press and the initiative of the middle classes . 
 The Congress disbanded in the third week of December , and the next step would be a congress at Laibach to discuss intervention with Ferdinand . Metternich found himself able to dominate Laibach more than any other congress , overseeing Ferdinand 's rejection of the liberal constitution he had agreed to only months before . Austrian armies left for Naples in February and entered the city in March . The Congress was adjourned but , forewarned or by luck , Metternich kept representatives of the powers close at hand until the revolt was put down . As a result , when similar revolts broke out in Piedmont in the middle of March , Metternich had the Tsar at hand , who agreed to send 90 @,@ 000 men to the frontier in a show of solidarity . Concerns grew in Vienna that Metternich 's policy was too expensive . He responded that Naples and Piedmont would pay for stability ; nonetheless , he , too , was clearly worried for the future of Italy . He was relieved when able to create a Court Chancellor and Chancellor of State on 25 May , a post left vacant since the death of Kaunitz in 1794 . He was also pleased at the renewed ( if fragile ) closeness between Austria , Prussia and Russia ; however , it had come at the expense of the Anglo @-@ Austrian entente .

 In 1821 , while Metternich was still at Laibach with Tsar Alexander , the revolt of Alexander Ypsilantis threatened to bring the Ottoman Empire to the brink of collapse . Wanting a strong Ottoman Empire to counterbalance Russian , Metternich opposed all forms of Greek nationalism . Before Alexander returned to Russia , Metternich secured his agreement not act unilaterally and would write to the Tsar again and again asking him not to intervene . For extra support he met with Viscount Castlereagh ( now also Marquis of Londonderry ) and King George IV of the United Kingdom in Hanover in October . The <unk> of Metternich 's welcome was sweetened by his promise to settle in part Austria 's financial debts to Britain . The earlier Anglo @-@ Austrian entente was thus restored , and the pair agreed that they would support the Austrian position concerning the Balkans . Metternich went away happy , not least because he had met Dorothea Lieven once more . 
 Over Christmas the Tsar wavered more than Metternich had expected and sent Dmitri <unk> to Vienna in February 1822 for talks with Metternich . Metternich soon convinced the " conceited and ambitious " Russian to let him dictate events . In return Austria promised to support Russia in enforcing her treaties with the Ottomans if the other alliance members would do likewise ; Metternich was aware this was politically impossible for the British . Metternich 's adversary at the Russian court , Kapodistrias , retired from service there ; however , by the end of April there was a new threat : Russia now determined to intervene in Spain , action Metternich described as " utter nonsense " . He played for time , convincing his ally Castlereagh to come to Vienna for talks before a scheduled congress in Verona , although Castlereagh died by suicide on 12 August . With Castlereagh dead and relations with the British weakening , Metternich had lost a useful ally . The Congress of Verona was a fine social event but diplomatically less successful . Supposedly concerned with Italy , the Congress had to focus on Spain instead . Austria urged non @-@ intervention , but it the French carried the day with their proposal for a joint invasion force . Prussia committed men , and the Tsar pledged 150 @,@ 000 . Metternich worried about the difficulties of transporting such numbers to Spain and about French ambitions , but still pledged ( if only moral ) support for the joint force . 
 He lingered in Verona until 18 December , then spending some days in Venice with the Tsar and then by himself in Munich . He returned to Vienna in early January 1823 and remained until September ; after Verona he travelled much less than before , partly because of his new post as Chancellor and partly because of his declining health . He was buoyed by the arrival of his family from Paris in May . He shone once more in Viennese society . Politically , the year was one of disappointments . In March the French crossed the Pyrenees unilaterally , undoing the " moral solidarity " established at Verona . Likewise , Metternich thought the new Pope Leo XII too pro @-@ French , and there was trouble between Austria and several German states over why they had not been included at Verona . Furthermore , Metternich , in discrediting the Russian diplomat Pozzo di Borgo , instead renewed the Tsar 's former suspicion of him . Worse came in late September : while accompanying the Emperor to a meeting with Alexander at Czernowitz , an Austrian settlement now in the Ukraine , Metternich fell ill with a fever . He could not continue and had to make do with brief talks with the Russian Foreign Minister , Karl Nesselrode . At the Czernowitz talks , in Metternich 's absence , an impatient Tsar asked for a congress in the then Russian capital Saint Petersburg to discuss the Eastern Question . Metternich , wary of letting the Russians dominate affairs , could only play for time . 
 Fortunately for Metternich the Tsar 's dual proposal for the St Petersburg meetings , a settlement of the Eastern Question favourable to Russia and limited autonomy for three Greek principalities , was a pairing unpalatable to the other European powers , and potential attendees like British Foreign Secretary George Canning slowly turned away , much to the annoyance of Alexander . Metternich believed for several months afterward that he had gained a unique level of influence over the Tsar . Meanwhile , he renewed the conservative program he had outlined at Karlsbad five years before and sought to further increase Austrian influence over the German Federal Diet . He also informed the press they could no longer publicise the minutes of Diet meetings , only its rulings . In January 1825 he began to worry about his wife Eleonore 's health and he reached her sickbed in Paris shortly before her death on 19 March . Mourning sincerely for her , he also took the opportunity to dine with the Paris elite . Unfortunately , an aside he made about the Tsar there was reported back and did not enhance his reputation . He left Paris for the last time on 21 April and was joined by the Emperor in Milan after arriving on 7 May . He declined the Pope 's invitation to become a cardinal of the church . There was also a short trip to Genoa . Early in July the court dispersed and Metternich visited his daughters Leontine ( fourteen ) and Hermine ( nine ) in the quiet town of Bad Ischl . Despite the seclusion he received constant reports , including those of ominous developments in the Ottoman Empire , where the Greek revolt was rapidly being crushed by Ibrahim Ali of Egypt . He also had to deal with fallout from St. Petersburg where the Tsar , although unable to convene a full congress , had talked with all the major ambassadors . By mid @-@ May it was clear the allies could not decide on a course of action and , as such , the Holy Alliance was no longer a viable political entity . 
 = = = Hungarian Diets , Alexander I 's Death , and Problems in Italy = = = 
 In the early 1820s , Metternich had advised Francis that convening the Hungarian Diet would help get approval for financial reform . In fact , the Diet of 1825 to 1827 saw 300 sessions filled with criticism of how the Empire had eroded the historic rights of the Kingdom of Hungary 's nobility . Metternich complained that it " interfered with [ his ] time , [ his ] customs and [ his ] daily life " , as he was forced to travel to Pressburg ( modern day Bratislava ) to perform ceremonial duties and to observe . He was alarmed by the growth of Hungarian national sentiment and wary of the growing influence of nationalist István Széchenyi , whom he had met twice in 1825 . Back in Vienna , in mid @-@ December , he heard of the death of Tsar Alexander with mixed feelings . He had known the Tsar well and was reminded of his own frailty , although the death potentially wiped the soured diplomatic slate clean . Moreover , he could claim credit for foreseeing the Decembrist liberal revolt the new Tsar Nicholas I had to crush . Now 53 , Metternich chose to send Archduke Ferdinand to establish first contact with Nicholas . Metternich was also friendly with the British envoy ( the Duke of Wellington ) and enlisted his help to charm Nicholas . Despite this , the first 18 months of Nicholas ' reign did not go well for Metternich : firstly , the British were chosen over the <unk> to oversee Russian @-@ Ottoman talks ; and , as a result , Metternich could exercise no influence over the resulting Akkerman Convention . France too began to drift away from Metternich 's non @-@ interventionist position . In August 1826 Russian Foreign Minister Nesselrode rejected a proposal by Metternich to convene a congress to discuss the events that eventually led to the outbreak of civil war in Portugal . The Austrian Foreign Minister accepted this with " surprising resilience " . 
 On 5 November 1827 Antoinette von <unk> became Metternich 's second wife . She was only twenty , and their marriage , a small affair at <unk> ( a village just outside Vienna ) , drew considerable criticism . Antoinette 's grace and charm soon won over Viennese society . The same day British , Russian and French forces destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino . Metternich worried that further intervention would topple the Ottoman Empire , upsetting the balance so carefully created in 1815 . To his relief the new British Prime Minister Wellington and his cabinet were equally fearful of giving Russia the upper hand in the Balkans . After another round of his proposals for congresses was rejected , Metternich stood back from the Eastern Question , watching as the Treaty of Adrianople was signed in September 1829 . Though he publicly criticised it for being too harsh on Turkey , privately he was satisfied with its leniency and promise of Greek autonomy , making it a buffer against Russian expansion rather than a Russian satellite state . Metternich 's private life was filled with grief . In November 1828 his mother died , and in January 1829 Antoinette died , five days after giving birth to their son , Richard von Metternich . After fighting tuberculosis for many months , Metternich 's son Viktor , then a junior diplomat , died on 30 November 1829 . Consequently , he spent Christmas alone and depressed , worried by the draconian methods of some of his fellow conservatives and by the renewed march of liberalism . 
 In May Metternich took a much needed holiday on his estate at Johannisberg . He returned to Vienna a month later , still worried by the " chaos in London and Paris " and his declining ability to prevent it . Hearing Nesselrode was due to take the waters at Karlsbad , he met him there in late July . He berated the quiet Nesselrode , but no offence was taken . The two arranged a second meeting in August . In the interim Metternich heard of France 's July Revolution , which deeply shocked him and theoretically posed the need for a congress of the Quadruple Alliance . Instead , Metternich met with Nesselrode as planned and , while the Russian rejected his plan to restore the old Alliance , the pair agreed on the <unk> of Karlsbad : that panic was needless unless the new government showed territorial ambitions in Europe . Although pleased by this , Metternich 's mood was soured by news of unrest in Brussels ( then part of the Netherlands ) , the resignation of Wellington in London , and calls for constitutionality in Germany . He wrote with sombre and " almost morbid relish " that it was the " beginning of the end " of Old Europe . Nonetheless , he was heartened by the fact that the July Revolution had made a Franco @-@ Russian alliance impossible and that the Netherlands had called an old @-@ style congress of the sort he enjoyed so much . The 1830 convocation of the Hungarian Diet was also more successful than past ones , crowning Archduke Ferdinand as King of Hungary with little dissent . Moreover , by November his betrothal to 25 @-@ year @-@ old Melanie Zichy @-@ Ferraris , who came from a Magyar family the <unk> had long known , was agreed upon . The announcement caused far less consternation in Vienna than Metternich 's previous bride , and they were married on 30 January 1831 . 
 In February 1831 rebels took the cities of Parma , Modena and Bologna and appealed to France for help . Their former masters appealed for help from Austria , but Metternich was anxious not to march Austrian troops into the Papal States without authorisation from the new Pope Gregory XVI . He occupied Parma and Modena , however , and eventually did cross into Papal territory . As a result , Italy was pacified by the end of March . He authorised troop withdrawal from the Papal States in July , but by January 1832 they were back to put down a second rebellion . By now Metternich was ageing noticeably : his hair was grey and his face drawn and sunken , although his wife still enjoyed his company . In February 1832 a daughter , also Melanie , was born ; in 1833 a son , Klemens , though he died aged two months ; in October 1834 a second son , Paul ; and in 1837 his third with Melanie , Lothar . Politically , Metternich had a new adversary , Lord Palmerston , who had taken over at the British Foreign Office in 1830 . By the end of 1832 they had clashed on virtually every issue . " In short , " Metternich wrote , " Palmerston is wrong about everything " . Mostly , Metternich was annoyed by his insistence that under the 1815 agreements Britain had the right to oppose Austria 's tightening of university controls in Germany , as Metternich had done again in 1832 . <unk> also worried that if future congresses were held in Britain , as Palmerston wanted , his own influence would be significantly reduced . 
 = = = Eastern Question Revisited and Peace in Europe = = = 
 In 1831 Egypt invaded the Ottoman Empire . There were fears of the Empire 's total collapse , by which Austria stood to gain little . Metternich therefore proposed multilateral support for the Ottomans and a Viennese congress to sort out details , but the French were evasive and the British refused to support any congress held in Vienna . By the summer of 1833 Anglo @-@ Austrian relations had hit a new low . With Russia Metternich was more confident of exerting influence . He was mistaken , however , and left to observe from afar Russian intervention in the region ( culminating in the Treaty of <unk> <unk> ) . He still arranged to meet with the King of Prussia at Teplitz and accompany Francis to meet Tsar Nicholas at <unk> in September 1833 . The former meeting went well : Metternich still felt able to dominate the Prussians , despite their rising economic prominence in Europe . The latter was more strained but , as Nicholas warmed , three <unk> Agreements were reached that shaped a new conservative league to uphold the existing order in Turkey , Poland , and elsewhere . Metternich left happy ; his sole disappointment was having to commit to being tougher on Polish nationalists . Almost immediately , he heard of the creation of the Quadruple Alliance of 1834 between Britain , France , Spain and Portugal . This alliance of liberals was such an affront to Austrian values that Palmerston wrote he " should like to see Metternich 's face when he reads our treaty " . It did indeed draw bitter condemnation , mostly because it provided occasion for an outbreak of war . Metternich tried two tacks : to intrigue for the removal of the British Foreign and to attempt ( vainly ) to build up cross @-@ power bloc agreements . Palmerston was indeed removed in November , but only temporarily and not by any of Metternich 's attempts . Large @-@ scale war , however , had been avoided and the Quadruple Alliance was beginning to disintegrate . 
 On 2 March 1835 Emperor Francis died , succeeded by his epileptic son Ferdinand I. Despite widespread opinion that Ferdinand was a " ghost of a monarch " , Metternich valued legitimacy highly and worked to keep the government running . He soon accompanied Ferdinand on his first meeting with Tsar Nicholas and the King of Prussia , again at Teplitz . Ferdinand was overwhelmed , especially as the delegations paraded into Prague . Overall , however , it was an untroubled meeting . The next few years passed relatively peacefully for Metternich : diplomatic incident was limited to the occasional angry exchange with Palmerston and Metternich 's failure to be a mediator between the British and Russians over their Black Sea dispute . He also put effort into bringing new technology like the railways into Austria . The most pressing issue was Hungary , where Metternich remained reluctant to support the centrist ( but still nationalist ) Széchenyi . His hesitancy is " a sad commentary on his declining powers of political presence " . At court Metternich increasingly lost power to the rising star Franz Anton von <unk> @-@ <unk> , particularly in his proposals to increase military budgets . After his failed attempt in 1836 to force constitutional reform ( which would have afforded him greater influence ) — largely thwarted by the more liberally minded Archduke John — Metternich was forced to share more power with <unk> and Archduke Ludwig as part of Austria 's Secret State Conference . Decision making ground to a halt . Entertaining and maintaining his estates at Johannisberg , Königswart and <unk> ( together with <unk> <unk> ) were consuming much of his resources at a time when he had four young children to support , causing him more stress . 
 Metternich had long predicted a new crisis in the East , and when the Second Turko @-@ Egyptian War broke out in 1839 he was anxious to re @-@ establish Austria 's diplomatic credentials . He quickly gathered representatives in Vienna , whence on July 27 they issued a communiqué to Constantinople pledging support . However , Tsar Nicholas sent Metternich a message from St Petersburg challenging Vienna 's claim to diplomatic centrality . Metternich worked so furiously that he fell ill , spending the next five weeks resting at Johannisberg . The Austrians lost the initiative , and Metternich had to accept that London would be the new centre of negotiations over the Eastern Question . Just three weeks after its creation , Metternich 's European League of Great Powers ( his diplomatic response to aggressive moves by French Prime Minister Adolphe Thiers ) had become a mere curiosity . Little , too , was heard of his proposals to hold a congress in Germany . A separate attempt to strengthen the influence of ambassadors stationed in Vienna was also rejected . This set the tone for the rest of Metternich 's chancellorship . His illness had , it seemed to others , broken his love of being in office . Over the next decade his wife prepared quietly for his retirement or death in office . Metternich 's work during the early 1840s was dominated again by Hungary and , more generally , questions of national identity within the diverse Austrian Empire . Here , Metternich " showed [ moments of ] acute perception " . His Hungarian proposals came far too late , however , as Lajos Kossuth had already led the rise of a strong Hungarian nationalism . Metternich 's support for other nationalities was patchy , since he only opposed those that threatened the unity of the Empire . 
 At the Conference of State Metternich lost his principal ally Karel Clam @-@ <unk> in 1840 , which furthered the growing paralysis at the heart of Austrian government . Metternich now struggled to enforce even the level of censorship he desired . Fortunately there were no major challenges to the regime from outside . Italy was quiet , and neither Metternich 's attempt to lecture the new Prussian king Frederick William IV nor the boredom of the new British Queen Victoria at their first meeting posed immediate problems . Far more worrying was Tsar Nicholas , whose estimation of the Habsburg dynasty and Austria was low . After an impromptu tour of Italy in 1845 the Tsar unexpectedly stopped in Vienna . Already in a bad mood , he was an awkward guest , though in between criticisms of Austria he reassured Metternich that Russia was not about to invade the Ottoman Empire again . Two months later their countries were required to work together over the Galician slaughter and a declaration of independence from Kraków . Metternich authorised the occupation of the city and use of troops to restore order in surrounding areas , intent on undoing the pseudo @-@ independence that had been granted Kraków in 1815 . After months of negotiations with Prussia and Russia , Austria annexed the city in November 1846 . Metternich regarded it as a personal victory , but it was an action of dubious utility : not only were Polish dissidents now officially part of Austria , the Europe @-@ wide Polish dissident movement was now worked actively against the " Metternich system " that had overridden the rights enshrined in 1815 . Britain and France appeared similarly outraged , although calls for Metternich 's resignation were ignored . For the next two years Ferdinand could not abdicate in favour of his son without a regency ; Metternich believed Austria would need him in the interim to hold government together . 
 = = Revolution = = 
 Though Metternich was tiring , memoranda kept pouring forth from his chancellery . Despite this he did not foresee the building crisis . The new Pope Pius IX was gaining a reputation as a liberal nationalist , counterbalancing Metternich and Austria ; at the same time , the Empire experienced unemployment and rising prices as a result of poor harvests . Metternich was bemused at the outcry from Italians , the Pope , and Palmerston when he ordered the occupation of Papal @-@ controlled Ferrara in the summer of 1847 . Despite securing French agreement for the first time in years from François Guizot over the Swiss Civil War , France and Austria were forced into backing breakaway cantons . The pair proposed a conference , but the government crushed the revolt . It was a major blow to Metternich 's prestige , and his opponents in Vienna called it evidence of his incompetence . In January 1848 Metternich predicted trouble in Italy during the year ahead . He acted on this by dispatching an envoy , Karl Ludwig von <unk> to Italy ; by resurrecting his 1817 plans for an Italian chancellery ; and by arranging various contingency plans with the French . In late February Austrian Field Marshal Joseph <unk> placed Austrian Italy ( Lombardy @-@ Venetia ) under martial law as disturbances spread . Despite this and hearing of renewed revolution in France , Metternich was cautious , still thinking domestic revolution unlikely . He was described by a Saxon diplomat as , in the words of biographer Musulin , " having shrunk to a shadow of his former self " . 
 On 3 March Kossuth gave a fiery speech in the Hungarian Diet , calling for a constitution . It was not until 10 March that Metternich appeared concerned about events in Vienna , where there were now threats and counter @-@ threats flying . Two petitions were organised , calling for greater freedom , transparency , and representation . Students were involved in several demonstrations , culminating on 13 March when they cheered the royal family but voiced anger at Metternich . After a customary morning , Metternich was called to meet with Archduke Ludwig soon after midday . The Chancellor had troops sent into the streets while also announcing a prearranged and minimal concession . In the afternoon the crowd turned hostile , and a division of troops opened fire on it , killing five . The mob was now truly incited , as the liberals were joined by underprivileged Viennese set on wreaking havoc . The students offered to form a pro @-@ government Academic Legion if their demands were met . Ludwig was eager to accept and told Metternich he must resign , to which he reluctantly agreed . After sleeping in the Chancellery he was advised to either take back his resignation or leave the city . After Ludwig sent him a message to the effect that the government could not guarantee his safety , Metternich left for the house of Count Taaffe and then , with aid from friends Charles von Hügel and Johann Rechberg , reached the family seat of Prince Liechtenstein forty miles away at <unk> . Metternich 's daughter Leontine joined them on 21 March and suggested England as a haven ; agreeing , Metternich , Melanie and 19 @-@ year @-@ old Richard set out , leaving the younger children with Leontine . Metternich 's resignation had been met with cheering in Vienna , and even the Viennese commoners welcomed the end of Metternich 's era of social conservatism . 
 = = Exile , return , and death = = 
 After an anxious journey of nine days during which they were honoured in some towns and refused entry to others , Metternich , his wife , and son Richard arrived in the Dutch city of Arnhem . They stayed until Metternich regained his strength , then reached Amsterdam and The Hague , where they waited to hear the results of a demonstration by English <unk> , planned for 10 April . On 20 April they landed at Blackwall in London , where they stayed in the Brunswick Hotel in Hanover Square for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence . Metternich largely enjoyed his time in London : the Duke of Wellington , now nearly eighty , tried to keep him entertained , and there were also visits from Palmerston , Guizot ( now also in exile ) and Benjamin Disraeli , who enjoyed his political conversation . The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge his presence in the capital . The trio leased a house , 44 Eaton Square , for four months . The younger children joined them in the summer . He followed events in Austria from afar , famously denying ever having erred ; in fact , he declared the turmoil in Europe to be vindication of his policies . In Vienna , a hostile post @-@ censorship press continued to attack him ; in particular , they accused him of embezzlement and accepting bribes , prompting an investigation . Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges , and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty handed . ( In all likelihood Metternich 's large expense claims were merely a product of the necessities of early 19th century diplomacy . ) Meanwhile , as he was denied his pension , Metternich was ironically reliant on loans . 
 In mid @-@ September the family moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace , Brighton on the south coast of England where tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with the revolutionary Europe left behind . Parliamentary figures , particularly Disraeli , travelled down to visit them , as did Metternich 's former friend Dorothea Lieven ( Melanie led a reconciliation between the two ) . Expecting a visit from Metternich 's daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline , the family moved to a suite of rooms at Richmond Palace on 23 April 1849 . Visitors included Wellington , who still watched out for Metternich ; Johann Strauss , the composer ; and Dorothea de Dino , sister of Metternich 's former lover <unk> of Sagan ; and former lover Katharina Bagration . Metternich was showing his age , and his frequent fainting was cause for worry . The ex @-@ Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor Franz Joseph I and his government . Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact , and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph ; sincere or not , it buoyed Metternich considerably . From mid @-@ August Melanie began to push for a move to Brussels , a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs . They arrived in October , staying overnight in the Hotel Bellevue . With revolution subsiding , Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna . Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited for an opportunity to re @-@ enter Austrian politics . It was a pleasant enough ( and cheap ) stay , first in the Boulevard de l 'Observatoire and later in the <unk> area — filled with visits from politicians , writers , musicians and scientists . For Metternich , however , the tedium and homesickness only increased . In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna , Prince Schwarzenberg , to ask if he might return if he promised not to interfere in public affairs . In April he received an affirmative reply , authorised by Franz Joseph . 
 In May 1851 Metternich left for his Johannisberg estate , which he had last visited in 1845 . That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian representative Otto von Bismarck . He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William , though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg . In September Metternich returned to Vienna , entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue . Metternich was reinvigorated , dropped his nostalgia , and lived in the present for the first time in a decade . Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues ( though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it ) , and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich ; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit . Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister , Karl Ferdinand von Buol but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable . Metternich 's advice was of varying quality ; nonetheless , some of it was usefully insightful , even in modern issues . Now deaf , Metternich wrote endlessly , particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef . He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War , though Buol did not . In the meantime Metternich 's health was slowly failing , and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854 . In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856 , he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline ( Richard 's step @-@ sister 's daughter ) and undertook more travel . The King of the Belgians came to visit , as did Bismarck , and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom . Buol , however , was growing more resentful of Metternich 's advice , particularly about Italy . In April 1859 Franz Josef came to ask him about what should be done in Italy . According to Pauline , Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy , and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent . 
 In this way , much to Metternich 's disappointment and to Franz Josef 's embarrassment , Austria began the Second Italian War of Independence against the combined forces of Piedmont @-@ Sardinia and her ally France . Though Metternich was able to secure the replacement of Buol with his friend Rechberg , who had helped him so much in 1848 , involvement in the war itself was now beyond his capacity . Even a special task given him by Franz Josef in June 1859 — to draw up secret papers addressing the event of Franz Josef 's death — was now too taxing . Shortly afterwards Metternich died in Vienna on 11 June 1859 , aged 86 , and the last great figure of his generation . Almost everyone of note in Vienna came to pay tribute ; in the foreign press his death went virtually unnoticed . 
 = = Historical Assessment = = 
 Particularly in the 19th century , Metternich was heavily criticised , decried as the man who prevented Austria and the rest of central Europe from " developing along normal liberal and constitutional lines " . Had Metternich not stood in the way of " progress , " Austria might have reformed , dealt better with the problems of nationality , and the First World War might never have happened . Instead , Metternich chose to fight an overwhelmingly fruitless war against the forces of liberalism and nationalism . Heavy censorship was just one of a range of repressive instruments of state available to him that also included a large spy network . He opposed electoral reform , criticising the British Reform Bill . In short , he locked himself into an embittered battle against " the prevailing mood of his age " . 
 On the other hand , Metternich 's diplomacy and statesmanship were the focus of praise in the 20th century from more favourably inclined historians , particularly biographer Heinrich von <unk> . For example , particularly after WWII , historians were more likely to defend Metternich 's policies as reasonable attempts to achieve his goals , chiefly the balance of power in Europe . Sympathetic historians point out that Metternich correctly foresaw and worked to prevent Russian dominance in Europe , succeeding where his successors would fail 130 years later . As argued by <unk> , Metternich himself pursued legality , cooperation , and dialogue , and therefore helped ensure 30 years of peace , the " Age of Metternich " . Authors like Peter Viereck and Ernst B. Haas also give Metternich credit for his more liberal ideals , even if they weighed relatively little in his overall policies . 
 Critical views presuppose Metternich had the ability to shape Europe favorably but chose not to . More modern critiques like that of A. J. P. Taylor have questioned how much influence Metternich actually wielded . Robin Okey , a critic of Metternich , noted that even in the realm of foreign affairs Metternich " had only his own persuasiveness to rely on " , and this degraded over time . By this interpretation , his task was to create a " smokescreen " that hid Austria 's true weakness . When it came to choosing a set of sound principles , wrote Taylor , " most men could do better while shaving " . The result was that Metternich was no captivating diplomat : Taylor described him as " the most boring man in European history " . Not only were his failures limited to foreign affairs , critics argue : at home he was equally powerless , failing to effect even his own proposals for administrative reform . In contrast , those who have attempted to rehabilitate Metternich describe him as " unquestionably [ a ] master of diplomacy " , someone who perfected and indeed shaped the nature of diplomacy in his era . In a similar vein , Alan <unk> argues that Metternich 's " smokescreen " may well have served a purpose in furthering a relatively coherent set of principles .

 = John R. Brinkley = 
 John Romulus Brinkley ( later John Richard Brinkley ; July 8 , 1885 – May 26 , 1942 ) was a controversial American who fraudulently claimed to be a medical doctor ( he had no legitimate medical education and bought his medical degree from a " diploma mill " ) who became known as the " goat @-@ gland doctor " after he achieved national fame , international notoriety and great wealth through the xenotransplantation of goat testicles into humans . Although initially Brinkley promoted this procedure as a means of curing male impotence , eventually he claimed that the technique was a virtual panacea for a wide range of male ailments . He operated clinics and hospitals in several states , and despite the fact that almost from the beginning , detractors and critics in the medical community thoroughly discredited his methods , he was able to continue his activities for almost two decades . He was also , almost by accident , an advertising and radio pioneer who began the era of Mexican border blaster radio . Although he was stripped of his license to practice medicine in Kansas and several other states , Brinkley , a demagogue beloved by hundreds of thousands of people in Kansas and elsewhere , nevertheless launched two campaigns for Kansas governor , one of which might have been successful had it not been for widespread ballot tampering by his opponents . Brinkley 's rise to fame and fortune was as precipitous as his eventual fall : At the height of his career he had amassed millions of dollars ; yet he died sick and nearly penniless , as a result of the large number of malpractice , wrongful death and fraud suits brought against him . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Brinkley was born to John Richard Brinkley , a poor mountain man who practiced medicine in North Carolina and served as a medic for the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War . Father Brinkley 's first marriage was annulled because he was underage . After he reached adulthood , he married four more times , and outlived each of his young , pretty wives . In 1870 , at the age of 42 , he married Sarah T. Mingus . Later , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old niece of Mingus moved into the house : Sarah Candice Burnett . The family called Brinkley 's wife " Sally " to differentiate between the two <unk> . Sarah Burnett gave birth out of wedlock to John Romulus Brinkley in the town of Beta , in Jackson County , North Carolina , naming her son after his father , and after Romulus , the mythical twin suckled by wolves . Sarah Burnett died of pneumonia and tuberculosis when Brinkley was five . Sarah T. " Aunt Sally " and John Brinkley moved with the young boy to East LaPorte within the same county , near the Tuckasegee River . The family had little money during this time . John Richard Brinkley died when his son was ten years old . Young Brinkley attended a one @-@ room log cabin school in the Tuckasegee area , held each year during three or four months of winter . There , Brinkley met Sally Margaret Wike , the daughter of a well @-@ off school board member . When Brinkley was 13 , the school term was lengthened , and a better teacher engaged . Brinkley finished his studies at 16 and began to work carrying mail between local towns , and to learn how to use a telegraph . He wished , however , to become a doctor . 
 = = Family and education = = 
 As a telegrapher , Brinkley went to New York City to work for Western Union , after which he moved to New Jersey to work at one , then another , railway company . In late 1906 , he returned home to Aunt Sally after hearing that she was unwell . She died on December 25 , 1906 . Afterward , he was comforted by Sally Wike , now 22 and a year older than Brinkley . They married on January 27 , 1907 , in Sylva , North Carolina . They traveled around posing as Quaker doctors , giving rural towns a medicine show where they hawked a patent medicine . Brinkley 's next move was to Knoxville , Tennessee , where he played right @-@ hand man , helping hawk virility " tonics " with a man named Dr. Burke . 
 Later in 1907 , Brinkley settled with his wife in Chicago , where they celebrated the birth of a daughter on November 5 – Wanda Marion Brinkley . The new father enrolled at Bennett Medical College , an unaccredited school with questionable curricula focused on Eclectic medicine . Brinkley worked for Western Union as a telegrapher at night and attended classes during the day , while debts mounted from tuition , the cost of raising a family , and from Sally 's self @-@ centered whims . In 1908 , the Brinkleys buried an infant son who had lived only three days . 
 At school , Brinkley was introduced to the study of glandular extracts and their effects on the human system . He determined that this new field would help move his career forward . After two years of studies , and ever @-@ deeper debts , Brinkley doubled his summer workload by taking two shifts at Western Union , but came home one day to find his wife and daughter gone . Sally filed for divorce and child support , but after two months of payments , Brinkley kidnapped his daughter and fled with her to Canada . Sally Brinkley , unable to obtain an extradition order from Canada , dismissed her suit for alimony and child support , allowing Brinkley to return to Chicago with the child . The couple reunited in their rocky marriage . 
 In 1911 , before Brinkley was finished with his third year of studies , Sally left him again , and bore him another daughter , Erna Maxine Brinkley , on July 11 , 1911 , back home in the Tuckasegee area . Brinkley left Chicago and his unpaid tuition bills to return to North Carolina and join his family . There , he began working as an " undergraduate physician " , but failed to establish himself . He moved his family around to different towns in Florida and North Carolina , " packing up and going all the time from one place to another " . 
 = = = Diploma mill = = = 
 In 1912 , Brinkley left his family to try to regain the thread of his education , this time in St. Louis , Missouri . He was unable to pay Bennett Medical College the tuition he owed them , so they refused to forward his scholastic records to any of the medical schools that Brinkley had approached . Instead , Brinkley bought a certificate from a shady diploma mill known as the Kansas City Eclectic Medical University and returned home . On February 11 , 1913 , his daughter Naomi Beryl Brinkley was born . The family of five immediately moved to New York City , and shortly thereafter to Chicago . When Brinkley refused to give up his goal of becoming a doctor , Sally Brinkley left him one final time , taking the three girls home to North Carolina . 
 Brinkley set up a storefront business in Greenville , South Carolina with a man named Crawford . The two opened their shop as the " Greenville Electro Medic Doctors " , and placed advertisements to attract men who were concerned about their manly vigor . They injected colored water into their patients at $ 25 a shot ( $ 600 in current value ) , telling them it was Salvarsan or " electric medicine from Germany " . After two months , the partners hurriedly left town with unpaid rent , utility bills and debts for clothing and pharmaceutical supplies . The local newspaper reported that the duo left about 30 to 40 local merchants with unpaid checks . They ended up where Crawford had once lived , in Memphis , Tennessee . 
 = = = Second marriage = = = 
 In Memphis , Brinkley met 21 @-@ year @-@ old Minerva <unk> " Minnie " Jones , a friend of Crawford 's and the daughter of a local physician . On August 23 , 1913 , after a four @-@ day courtship , Brinkley and Jones married at the Peabody Hotel , even though he was still married to Sally Brinkley . Minnie and John Brinkley honeymooned in Kansas City , Denver , Pocatello and Knoxville . Brinkley was arrested in Knoxville and extradited to Greenville where he was put in jail for practicing medicine without a license and for writing bad checks . Brinkley told the sheriff that it was all Crawford 's fault , and gave investigators enough information that they were able to nab Crawford in Pocatello . The two former partners met again in jail . 
 Brinkley and Crawford decided to settle out of court with Greenville 's angry merchants for a sum of several thousand dollars , most of which Crawford paid . Brinkley 's new father @-@ in @-@ law paid Brinkley 's bail , but only contributed $ 200 to his fraudulent debt settlement ( $ 5 @,@ 100 in current value . ) . Brinkley rejoined Minnie Brinkley in Memphis . There , Sally Brinkley confronted the couple , informing Minnie Brinkley that her husband was a bigamist . Minnie and John Brinkley moved to <unk> , Arkansas , where he again obtained an " undergraduate license " to practice medicine , advertising his specialty as " diseases of women and children " . He made little profit , and joined the Army Reserve Medical Corps . 
 Brinkley accepted an offer to take over the office of another doctor who was moving out of state . Brinkley began to turn a modest profit , and was finally able to pay Bennett Medical University the amount owed for tuition . In October 1914 , the Brinkleys moved to Kansas City where he enrolled at that city 's Eclectic Medical University to finish out his last year remaining of the education he started at Bennett . After studying the irritations and enlargements of the prostate gland in elderly men , and paying the university $ 100 ( $ 2 @,@ 300 in current value ) , Brinkley graduated on May 7 , 1915 . His diploma from Eclectic allowed him to practice medicine in eight states . While in Kansas City , Brinkley took a job as the doctor for the Swift and Company plant , patching minor wounds and studying animal physiology . It was here that Brinkley learned that popular opinion held that the healthiest animal slaughtered at the plant was the goat , something that would prove pivotal to his later medical career . 
 To resolve the possibility of his bigamy being exposed , Minnie pushed Brinkley to file for divorce from Sally , which he did in December 1915 . To prevent the court from inquiring of Sally directly , he wrote that they had been married in New York City , and that he did not know her current place of residence . The divorce was finalized on February 21 , 1916 . Four days later , Minnie and Brinkley were married again , this time in Liberty , Missouri . Brinkley had not waited the required six months from divorce to subsequent remarriage . 
 In 1917 , Brinkley , now an Army Reservist , was called up for service during World War I. However , he only served a little over two months , most of the duration of which he was sick with a nervous breakdown , before being discharged . In October of the same year , Brinkley and his wife moved to Milford , Kansas after having spotted a newspaper ad saying the town needed a doctor . 
 = = Goat gland transplantation = = 
 In 1918 , Brinkley opened a 16 @-@ room clinic in Milford , where he won over the locals immediately by paying good wages , invigorating the local economy and making house calls on patients afflicted with the virulent and deadly outbreak of the 1918 flu pandemic . For all his later infamy as a charlatan , accounts of his success at nursing flu victims back to health , and the lengths to which he went to treat them , were resoundingly positive . 
 As recounted in the biography that Brinkley had commissioned , he struck upon the idea of transplanting goat testicles into men when a patient came to him to ask if he could fix someone who was " sexually weak " . Brinkley responded by joking that the patient would have no problem if he had " a pair of those buck [ goat ] glands in you " . The patient then begged Brinkley to try the operation , which Brinkley did , for $ 150 . ( The patient 's son later told The Kansas City Star that Brinkley had in fact offered to pay his father " handsomely " if he 'd go along with the experiment . ) 
 At his clinic , Brinkley began to perform more operations he claimed would restore male virility and fertility through implanting the testicular glands of goats in his male patients at a cost of $ 750 per operation ( $ 8 @,@ 900 in current value ) . Following one of his crude operations , the body of a patient would typically absorb the goat gonads as foreign matter . The organs were never accepted as part of the body since they were simply placed into the human male testicle sac or the abdomen of women , near the ovaries . Unsurprisingly , in light of his questionable medical training ( 75 percent completion at a less @-@ than @-@ reputable medical school ) , frequency of operating while intoxicated and less @-@ than sterile operating environments , some patients suffered from infection , and an undetermined number died . Brinkley would be sued more than a dozen times for wrongful death between 1930 and 1941 . 
 Soon after Brinkley opened up shop , he scored an advertising coup that made major newspapers come calling : the wife of his first goat gland transplantation patient gave birth to a baby boy . Brinkley began promoting goat glands as a cure for 27 ailments , ranging from dementia to emphysema to flatulence . He started a direct mail blitz and hired an advertising agent , who helped Brinkley portray his treatments as turning hapless men into " the ram that am with every lamb " . His burst of publicity — and his stratospheric claims — attracted the attention of the American Medical Association , which sent an agent to the clinic to investigate undercover . The agent found a woman hobbling around Brinkley 's clinic who had been given goat ovaries as a cure for a spinal cord tumor . From then on , Brinkley was on the AMA 's radar , including catching the eye of the doctor that would eventually be responsible for his downfall , Morris Fishbein , who made his career exposing medical frauds . 
 At the same time , other doctors were also experimenting with gland transplantation , including Serge <unk> , who had become known for grafting monkey testicles into men . In 1920 <unk> demonstrated his technique before several other doctors at a hospital in Chicago , at which Brinkley showed up uninvited . Though Brinkley was barred at the door , his appearance elevated his profile in the press , which eventually resulted in his own demonstration at a hospital in Chicago . Brinkley transplanted goat testicles into 34 patients , including a judge , an alderman , a society matron and the chancellor of the University of Chicago Law School , all while the press looked on . His public profile grew , and his gland business in Milford continued at a brisk pace . 
 In 1922 , Brinkley traveled to Los Angeles at the invitation of Harry Chandler , owner of the Los Angeles Times , who challenged Brinkley to transplant goat testicles into one of his editors . If the operation was a success , Chandler wrote , he would make Brinkley the " most famous surgeon in America " , and if not then he should consider himself " damned " . California didn 't recognize Brinkley 's license to practice medicine from the Eclectic Medical University , but Chandler pulled some strings and got him a 30 @-@ day permit . The operation was judged a success , and Brinkley received his promised attention in Chandler 's paper , which sent many new customers Brinkley 's way , including some Hollywood film stars . Brinkley was so taken with the city — and all the money it represented in the form of potential patients — that he began making plans to relocate his clinic there . But his hopes were dashed when the California medical board denied his application for a permanent license to practice medicine , having found his resume " riddled with lies and discrepancies " ( most of which were discovered and pointed out to the board by Fishbein ) . Brinkley returned to Kansas undaunted and began to expand his clinic in Milford . 
 Brinkley 's activities inspired the film industry term ' goat gland ' — the grafting of talkie sequences onto silent films to make them marketable . 
 = = = Brinkley 's first radio station = = = 
 While in Los Angeles , Brinkley toured KHJ , a radio station Chandler owned . He immediately saw the power radio held as an advertising and marketing medium and resolved to build his own to promote his services , even though at the time advertising on public airwaves was very much discouraged . By 1923 he had enough capital to build KFKB ( " Kansas First , Kansas Best " or sometimes " Kansas Folks Know Best " ) using a 1 kilowatt transmitter . That same year , the St. Louis Star published a scathing expose of medical diploma mills , and in 1924 the Kansas City Journal Post followed suit , bringing unwelcome attention Brinkley 's way . In July 1924 , a grand jury in San Francisco handed down 19 indictments to people responsible for conferring fake medical degrees , and for some doctors who received them ; Brinkley was one , due mostly to his questionable application for a California medical license . When agents from California came to arrest Brinkley , the governor of Kansas refused to extradite him because he made the state too much money . Brinkley took to his radio station 's airwaves to crow about his victory over the American Medical Association and Fishbein , who by this time had started giving speeches and writing articles for the Journal of the American Medical Association deriding Brinkley and his treatments as quackery . His gland business made more money than ever , and had begun attracting patients from around the globe . 
 Brinkley spoke for hours on end each day on the radio , primarily promoting his goat gland treatments . He variously cajoled , shamed and appealed to men 's ( and women 's ) egos , and to their desire to be more sexually active . In between Brinkley 's own advertisements , his new station featured a variety of entertainment including military bands , French lessons , astrological forecasts , storytelling and exotica such as native Hawaiian songs , and American roots music including old @-@ time string band , gospel and early country . 
 The advertising boost his radio station gave him was enormous , and Milford benefited as well ; Brinkley paid for a new sewage system and sidewalks , installed electricity , built a bandstand and apartments for his patients and employees , as well as a new post office to handle all of his mail . He was named an " admiral " in the Kansas Navy and sponsored a hometown baseball team called the Brinkley Goats . 
 Eager for better credentials , in 1925 Brinkley traveled to Europe searching for honorary degrees . After being rebuffed by several institutes in the United Kingdom , Brinkley found a willing suitor in the university in Pavia , Italy . Fishbein and Brinkley 's former teacher , Max <unk> , heard about the degree and pressured the Italian government to rescind it . Benito Mussolini himself revoked the degree , though Brinkley claimed it until he died . Fishbein 's interest in putting Brinkley out of business grew and he wrote more articles featuring stories about people who had grown sick or died after seeing Brinkley . But the AMA journal 's readership was mostly restricted to other doctors , while Brinkley 's radio station poured directly into peoples ' homes every day . 
 After his birth on September 3 , 1927 , the tiny voice of Brinkley 's son John Richard Brinkley III , nicknamed " Johnny Boy " , was heard on the radio program . Noting the baby 's arrival after 14 years of marriage , some observers wondered if Brinkley had taken his own goat gland treatment . The Brinkleys denied such rumors . 
 = = = Medical Question Box = = = 
 Brinkley began claiming his goat glands could also help male prostate problems , and expanded his business again . He also started a new radio segment called " Medical Question Box " , where he would read listeners ' medical complaints over the air and suggest proprietary treatments . These treatments were only available at a network of pharmacies that were members of the " Brinkley Pharmaceutical Association " . These affiliated pharmacies sold Brinkley 's over the counter medicines at highly inflated prices , sent a portion of their profit back to Brinkley and kept the rest . It is estimated that this generated $ 14 @,@ 000 in profit weekly for Brinkley , or about $ 10 @,@ 312 @,@ 400 per year in current value . Reports of patients who took Brinkley 's suggested treatments showing up sick at another doctor 's office began to grow , and eventually Merck & Co. pharmaceuticals , whose medicines Brinkley routinely <unk> , requested Fishbein take action ; the AMA responded that they had no power over Brinkley , save to try to inform the public . 
 The Kansas City Star , which owned a radio station that competed with Brinkley 's , ran an unfavorable series of reports on him . By 1930 , when the Kansas Medical Board held a formal hearing to decide whether Brinkley 's medical license should be revoked , Brinkley had signed death certificates for 42 people , many of whom were not sick when they showed up at his clinic . It is unclear how many more of Brinkley 's patients may have become ill or later died elsewhere . The medical board revoked his license , stating that Brinkley " has performed an organized <unk> ... quite beyond the invention of the humble mountebank " . 
 Six months after losing his medical license , the Federal Radio Commission refused to renew his station ’ s broadcasting license , finding that Brinkley 's broadcasts were mostly advertising , which violated international treaties , that he broadcast obscene material , and that his Medical Question Box series was " contrary to the public interest " . He sued the commission , but the courts upheld the revocation and the case Brinkley v. FRC became a landmark case in broadcast law . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Brinkley reacted to losing his medical and broadcast licenses by launching a bid to become the Governor of Kansas , a political position that would enable him to appoint his own members to the medical board and thus regain his right to practice medicine in the state . He kicked off his candidacy just three days after he lost his medical license , using his radio station to help his campaign . At his side was KFKB 's biggest country @-@ music star , Roy Faulkner , who took to the stage with guitar and hat in hand . Brinkley campaigned on a vague program of public works ( a state lake in every county ) , education ( free textbooks for public schoolchildren and increased educational opportunities for blacks ) , lower taxes , and old @-@ age pensions . He appealed to the immigrant vote by putting German- and Swedish @-@ speaking people on the air at KFKB . He enlisted a pilot with his own plane ( which Brinkley dubbed The <unk> ) to deliver Brinkley in grand style at his campaign rallies . In short , Brinkley was a master of the publicity stunt ; when a prominent newspaper reporter ran an article critical of his qualifications to run a state , Brinkley sent him a goat . 
 His campaign was conducted as an independent write @-@ in candidate , because he waited to declare his candidacy until September , after the ballots had already been printed . Three days before the election , the Kansas attorney general ( who had prosecuted Brinkley before the medical board ) announced that the rules surrounding write @-@ in candidates had changed , and that the doctor 's name could only be written in one specific way for the vote to count ( as J. R. Brinkley ) . As a write @-@ in candidate , he received more than 180 @,@ 000 votes ( 29 @.@ 5 percent of the vote ) and lost to Harry Hines Woodring , later Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's secretary of war . An article published at the time in The Des Moines Register estimated that between 30 @,@ 000 and 50 @,@ 000 ballots were disqualified in this manner . Woodring later admitted that had those votes counted , Brinkley would have won . 
 Brinkley ran again in 1932 as an Independent , receiving 244 @,@ 607 votes ( 30 @.@ 6 percent of the vote ) , losing to Republican Alf Landon , later Republican nominee for president . 
 His prospects for success in Kansas destroyed , Brinkley sold KFKB to an insurance company and decided to move closer to the Mexican border , where he could operate a high @-@ power radio station with impunity . Though he could no longer practice medicine in Kansas , he kept his Milford clinic open and put two of his protégés in charge . <unk> by the prospect of being a big fish in a very small pond , Brinkley relocated to sleepy Del Rio , Texas , which lay just across a bridge from Mexico . 
 = = Brinkley and radio = = 
 The Mexican government , eager to get even with its northern neighbors for dividing up North America 's radio wavelengths without giving any to Mexico , granted Brinkley a 50 @,@ 000 @-@ watt radio license and construction began on XER @-@ AM , his new " border blaster " across the bridge from Del Rio in Villa Acuña , Coahuila ( since renamed Ciudad Acuña ) . As construction got underway , Fishbein and the U.S. State Department desperately searched for a way to shut Brinkley down . Under heavy pressure from the State Department , the Mexican government halted construction on XER @-@ AM , but it was only temporary . Within weeks , construction resumed and soon two 300 @-@ foot ( 91 m ) towers reached into the sky . XER , at 840 kilohertz on the AM dial , radiated by a sky wave antenna , made its first broadcast in October 1931 . Brinkley called it the " Sunshine Station Between the Nations " . 
 Brinkley used his new border blaster to resume his campaign for governor by using the telephone to call in his broadcasts to the transmitter . This approach did not work , and he lost yet another political campaign ; he would lose again in 1934 . Though Brinkley 's American radio license had been revoked , XER 's signal was so strong that it could still be heard in Kansas . In 1932 , the Mexican government allowed Brinkley to up his wattage to 150 @,@ 000 watts . Several months later , Brinkley was allowed to increase to one million watts , " making XER far and away the most powerful radio station on the planet " that , on a clear night , could be heard as far away as Canada . According to accounts of the time , the signal was so strong that it turned on car headlights , made <unk> hum , and caused broadcasts to bleed into telephone conversations . Local residents didn 't even need a radio to hear Brinkley 's station ; ranchers reported that they received it through their metal fences and in their dental appliances . 
 Brinkley continued his old radio format of medical advice keyed to advertising products . Male listeners were offered an array of expensive concoctions which included Mercurochrome injections and pills , all designed to help them regain their sexual prowess . At the clinic in the hotel where he lived he also performed prostate operations . He also began selling airtime to other advertisers ( at $ 1 @,@ 700 an hour , $ 24 @,@ 100 in current value ) , giving rise to new hucksters shilling products such as " Crazy Water Crystals " , " genuine simulated " diamonds , life insurance , and an array of religious paraphernalia , including what was purported to be autographed pictures of Jesus Christ . Brinkley also continued packing his radio lineup with up @-@ and @-@ coming country and roots singers whose careers his radio station helped launch ( including Patsy Montana , Red Foley , Gene Autry , Jimmie Rodgers , The Carter Family , and others ) . Del Rio became known as " Hillbilly Hollywood " . 
 When the FRC banned what they called " spooks " ( mind readers , fortune @-@ tellers and other mystics ) from broadcasting on U.S. radio in 1932 , many of them followed Brinkley 's model , opening their own border blasters in Mexico . By 1932 , 11 such stations had opened , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Brinkley was still shuttling back and forth from Milford to Del Rio , often broadcasting from XER over the telephone . But in 1932 , Congress passed a law outlawing this practice , known as the Brinkley Act . Unfazed , Brinkley began using some of the first " electrical transcriptions " — what today would be called pre @-@ recordings — to circumvent the law . Around this time , Brinkley decided to sever the rest of his ties to Kansas , closing down his hospital there and opening a new one in Del Rio , which took up three floors of the Roswell Hotel , where he lived with his wife . 
 In 1934 , Mexico revoked Brinkley 's broadcast license , the result of pressure from the United States . Soldiers from the Mexican army arrived at the station 's doorstep to shut him down , and for a time he had to broadcast from nearby <unk> , located in Piedras Negras , Coahuila . 
 Though Brinkley continued to perform the occasional goat gland transplant , in Texas his practice shifted mostly to performing slightly modified vasectomies and prostate " <unk> " ( for which he charged up to $ 1 @,@ 000 per operation ( $ 17 @,@ 300 in current value ) , and prescribed his own proprietary medicine for after @-@ care ) . His business , fueled by radio advertisements and speeches , continued to thrive , and he opened another clinic in San Juan , Texas specializing in the colon . By 1936 , Brinkley had amassed enough wealth to build a mansion for himself and his wife on 16 acres ( 6 @.@ 5 ha ) of land . Brinkley boasted a stable of a dozen Cadillacs , a greenhouse , a foaming fountain garden surrounded by 8 @,@ 000 bushes , exotic animals imported from the Galapagos Islands , and a swimming pool with a 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) diving tower . Brinkley continued living high in Del Rio , until in 1938 a rival doctor began cutting into Brinkley 's business by offering similar procedures much more cheaply . When Del Rio 's city elders refused to put the competitor out of business , Brinkley closed up shop and reopened in downtown Little Rock , Arkansas with another hospital at what is now <unk> Monastery . His competition from Del Rio opened a new cancer center in Eureka Springs , Arkansas , about 150 miles ( 240 km ) northwest of Little Rock . 
 Brinkley is referenced in ZZ Top 's " Heard it on the X " : 
 " We can all thank Doctor B who stepped across the line . With lots of watts he took control , the first one of its kind . " 
 = = Trial and death = = 
 In 1938 , Brinkley 's old nemesis , Morris Fishbein , entered the picture again with a vengeance , publishing a two @-@ part series called " Modern Medical Charlatans " that included a thorough repudiation of Brinkley 's checkered career , as well as exposing his questionable medical credentials . Brinkley sued Fishbein for libel and $ 250 @,@ 000 in damages ( $ 4 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 in current value ) . The trial began on March 22 , 1939 , before Texas judge R. J. MacMillan . A few days later , the jury found for Fishbein , stating that Brinkley " should be considered a charlatan and a quack in the ordinary , well @-@ understood meaning of those words " . The jury verdict unleashed a barrage of lawsuits against Brinkley , by some estimates well over $ 3 million in total value . Also around this time , the Internal Revenue Service began investigating him for tax fraud . He declared bankruptcy in 1941 , the same year the U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement on allocating radio bandwidth and shut down <unk> . 
 Soon after his bankruptcy the United States Post Office Department began investigating him for mail fraud , and Brinkley became a patient himself , having suffered three heart attacks and the amputation of one of his legs due to poor circulation . On May 26 , 1942 , Brinkley died penniless of heart failure in San Antonio ; the mail fraud case had not yet come to trial . He was later buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis , Tennessee . 
 His house , commonly called the Brinkley Mansion , still stands today at 512 Qualia Drive in Del Rio and has been designated Texas Historic Landmark number <unk> . 
 = German cruiser Nürnberg = 
 Nürnberg was a German light cruiser of the Leipzig class built for the Kriegsmarine . She was named after the city of Nuremberg and had one sister ship , Leipzig . Nürnberg was laid down in 1934 , launched in December of that year , and completed in November 1935 . She was armed with a main battery of nine 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns in three triple turrets and could steam at a speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) . Nürnberg was the longest @-@ serving major warship of the Kriegsmarine , and the only one to see active service after the end of World War II , though not in a German navy . 
 In the late 1930s , Nürnberg took part in the non @-@ intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War without major incident . After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , she was used to lay defensive minefields off the German coast . She was thereafter used to escort offensive mine @-@ layers in the North Sea until she was torpedoed by a British submarine in December 1939 . She was thereafter used as a training ship in the Baltic Sea for most of the rest of the war , apart from a short deployment to Norway from November 1942 to April 1943 . In January 1945 , she was assigned to mine @-@ laying duties in the Skaggerak , but severe shortages of fuel permitted only one such operation . 
 After the end of the war , Nürnberg was seized by the Royal Navy and ultimately awarded to the Soviet Union as war reparations . In December 1945 , a Soviet crew took over the ship , and the following month took her to Tallinn , where she was renamed Admiral Makarov . She served in the Soviet Navy , first in the 8th Fleet , then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt . By 1960 , she had been broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Nürnberg was 181 @.@ 3 meters ( 595 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 16 @.@ 3 m ( 53 ft ) and a maximum draft of 5 @.@ 74 m ( 18 @.@ 8 ft ) forward . She displaced 9 @,@ 040 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 900 long tons ; 9 @,@ 960 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two steam turbines and four MAN two @-@ stroke double @-@ acting diesel engines . Steam for the turbines was provided by six Marine @-@ type double @-@ ended oil @-@ fired boilers . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) and a range of approximately 3 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 200 km ; 4 @,@ 500 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) using only the diesel engines . Nürnberg had a crew of 25 officers and 648 enlisted men . She was fitted with a catapult and a crane to handle two Heinkel He 60 floatplanes , though these were later replaced with Arado Ar 196 models . 
 The ship was armed with nine 15 cm SK C / 25 guns mounted in three triple gun turrets . One was located forward , and two were placed in a superfiring pair aft , all on the centerline . They were supplied with between 1 @,@ 080 and 1 @,@ 500 rounds of ammunition , for between 120 and 166 shells per gun . The ship was also equipped with eight 8 @.@ 8 cm SK C / 32 anti @-@ aircraft guns , eight 3 @.@ 7 cm SK C / 30 anti @-@ aircraft guns , and several 2 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns , though the number of the latter changed over her career . Nürnberg also carried four triple torpedo tube mounts located amidships ; they were supplied with twenty @-@ four 50 cm ( 20 in ) torpedoes . She was also capable of carrying 120 naval mines . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick amidships and an armored belt that was 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides . 
 = = = Modifications = = = 
 After the outbreak of war , the ship was fitted with a degaussing coil to protect her against magnetic mines . In 1942 , the ship 's aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were removed . Throughout the war , her radar suite was upgraded ; in March 1941 , she was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942 , a FuMO 25 radar set was installed . The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low @-@ flying aircraft at low range . The FuMO 21 set was replaced by the short @-@ range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50 @-@ centimeter radar . Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers . 
 The ship 's anti @-@ aircraft battery was improved over the course of World War II . In late 1942 , a pair of Army @-@ variant 2 cm Flakvierling quadruple mounts were installed , one on the navigating bridge and the other on top of the aft superfiring turret . In May 1944 , the navy proposed installing several Bofors 40 mm guns , but most of these weapons were diverted to other uses , and only two guns were installed . One was mounted on the bridge and the other where the catapult had been located . Two Navy @-@ pattern Flakvierlings were added ; one replaced the Army model atop the aft superfiring turret , and the other was placed in front of the anti @-@ aircraft fire director . The Army @-@ pattern Flakvierlings were moved to the main deck . In December 1944 , another revised anti @-@ aircraft plan was proposed , this time incorporating the new 3 @.@ 7 cm FlaK 43 gun , of which there were to be eight , along with two Flakvierlings and ten 2 cm twin mounts . Germany 's wartime situation by the end of 1944 prevented these changes from being made , however . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Nürnberg was laid down in 1934 at the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel . She was launched on 6 December 1934 and completed in less than a year , being commissioned on 2 November 1935 . The ship thereafter worked up in the Baltic Sea until April 1936 , when she joined Köln and Leipzig for a training cruise into the Atlantic . At this time , she was made the flagship of the reconnaissance forces of the German Navy . The three cruisers then returned to the Baltic for additional maneuvers . Nürnberg participated the non @-@ intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 39 . On her initial deployment in 1936 , she flew the flag of Konteradmiral Hermann Boehm . Over the course of the conflict , Nürnberg conducted four patrols off Spain , but did not encounter any belligerent forces , with the exception of a claimed attack by an unidentified submarine south of the Balearic Islands on 16 July 1937 . 
 In September 1937 , Nürnberg took part in fleet maneuvers with the heavy cruisers Admiral Graf Spee and Deutschland , the light cruisers Leipzig and Karlsruhe , and several destroyers . The first three months of 1938 were spent in the Baltic , after which Nürnberg went into dock for a periodic refit . In June , she went on a training cruise to Norway and returned to Germany the following month . In August , she was present at the fleet review held in Kiel for Adolf Hitler and the visiting regent of Hungary , Miklós Horthy . Nürnberg joined the fleet that was sent to Memel in March 1939 to seize the region . After completing the occupation , Nürnberg joined Admiral Graf Spee , Leipzig , and Köln for a training cruise to the Mediterranean Sea , which included several stops in Spanish ports . After returning to Germany in May , she resumed training in the Baltic . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939 , Nürnberg was assigned to the blockade force that was intended to prevent the Polish Navy from escaping the Baltic . Despite the Germans ' efforts , several Polish destroyers and submarines escaped to Britain , where they continued the war . On 3 September , Nürnberg and the rest of the cruisers were withdrawn to the North Sea to lay a series of defensive minefields to protect the German coastline . She returned to the Baltic for training exercises in October . The following month , she was transferred back to the North Sea , where she was tasked with escorting destroyers laying minefields off the British coast . On 4 – 6 December , the ship conducted a mining operation off Kristiansand , Norway . 
 On 13 December , while escorting a group of destroyers returning from a mine @-@ laying operation off the British coast , the Royal Navy submarine HMS Salmon launched a spread of torpedoes at the German flotilla . Two torpedo tracks were spotted heading toward Nürnberg , and the ship turned hard to port in an attempt to evade them . One passed harmlessly ahead of the ship , but the second struck her in the bow . Nürnberg reduced speed to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) to allow her crew to inspect the damage , when three more torpedo tracks were spotted to port . The ship immediately accelerated to full speed and turned to starboard ; the torpedoes exploded in the cruiser 's wake . The hit caused some minor flooding and minimal damage , but her watertight bulkheads held . The Germans spotted Salmon and briefly engaged her with Nürnberg 's rearmost main battery turret , but to no effect . Nürnberg thereafter got underway at a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) and made for port . HMS Ursula unsuccessfully attacked the damaged cruiser the following day , just before she entered the Kiel Canal at Brunsbüttel . After arriving in Kiel , Nürnberg went into drydock at Deutsche Werke for repairs , which lasted until April 1940 . 
 In early June 1940 , Nürnberg 's commander , Kapitän zur See ( KzS ) Otto Klüber , was informed that the ship would not participate in Operation Juno , a sortie by the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst . Instead , she was transferred to Norway , departing Kiel on 10 June under the escort of the torpedo boats Falke and Jaguar . On 12 June , the torpedo boats were sent to Stavanger for fuel , and in the meantime , Nürnberg steamed a zig @-@ zag course at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) to evade any submarines that might be in the area . The following day , the 2nd Minesweeper Flotilla took over her escort duty off Trondheim . On 17 June , Nürnberg reached Narvik , which was to be her base for the next month . During this period , one of her Arado Ar 196 floatplanes unsuccessfully attacked a British submarine . This was the only action the ship saw while in Norway . On 25 July , Nürnberg and several destroyers and torpedo boats escorted the damaged battleship Gneisenau , which had been torpedoed by a British submarine , from Trondheim , Norway , to Kiel . The flotilla arrived in Kiel on 28 July . 
 On 8 August , KzS Leo <unk> replaced Klüber as the ship 's commander . Nürnberg spent the rest of the year in the Baltic . The Italian Admiral <unk> visited the ship while she was in Gotenhafen in September . A short refit was conducted at Deutsche Werke in October and November . On 15 February 1941 , she was reclassified as a training cruiser and assigned to the Fleet Training Squadron , along with the other surviving light cruisers . These ships were tasked with training the crews for the U @-@ boat arm , which was expanding rapidly to wage the Battle of the Atlantic . At the start of this period , many of her crewmen were themselves transferred to the U @-@ boat fleet . After the outbreak of war with the Soviet Union in June 1941 , Nürnberg was reassigned to the Baltic Fleet , which was centered on the new battleship Tirpitz . After it became clear that the Soviet Baltic Fleet did not intend to sortie , the German ships were dispersed . Nürnberg returned to her training duties for the remainder of the year . Another refit was conducted in January 1942 ; during this period , her aircraft equipment and aft torpedo tubes were removed , and her light anti @-@ aircraft armament was increased . Allied air raids caused some damage , which delayed her return to service until 23 August . 
 She thereafter conducted sea trials until October , after which she was deployed to Norway . On 11 November , Nürnberg left Gotenhafen , bound for Trondheim . She arrived there on 18 November , and remained there until she was transferred to Bogen Bay outside Narvik on 2 December . There , she joined the fleet in being , which was , again , centered on Tirpitz . Nürnberg saw no action during this period . On 27 April 1943 , Nürnberg left Narvik for German waters via Trondheim . After arriving in Kiel on 3 May , she had her machinery overhauled . After the work was completed in late May , she was assigned to the Training Squadron in the Baltic . Frequent crew changes kept the ship at a very low state of readiness . She remained in this duty through 1944 , and she saw no action . She was not assigned to the shore bombardment units that supported the retreating German Army on the Eastern Front , unlike most of the other ships of the Training Squadron . 
 At the start of 1945 , she was assigned to mine @-@ laying duty in the Skaggerak , and was based in Oslo , Norway . She completed only one mine @-@ laying operation , Operation Titus , on 13 January . The forces assigned to the operation included two destroyers , two torpedo boats , and a mine @-@ layer ; Nürnberg herself carried 130 mines . Severe fuel shortages prevented any further operations . On 24 January , she steamed to Copenhagen , where she remained until the end of the war , as she had only 270 long tons ( 270 t ) of synthetic fuel oil aboard . On 5 May 1945 , she received the ceasefire order , and on 22 May , the British cruisers HMS Devonshire and HMS Dido arrived to take over Nürnberg . 
 = = = Post @-@ war service = = = 
 On 24 May , Nürnberg and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen sailed from Copenhagen under escort by Devonshire , Dido , and several other warships . The flotilla arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 28 May , and the German vessels remained there while their fates were determined at the Potsdam Conference . The Allies eventually decided to award Nürnberg to the Soviet Union . To prevent the Germans from scuttling their ships as they had done in 1919 , the Allies formally seized the vessels on 19 December , while Nürnberg was in drydock . That day , the ship 's Soviet crew came aboard . On 2 January , the Soviets took their seized warships , which also included the target ship Hessen , Hessen 's radio @-@ control vessel Blitz , the destroyer Z15 Erich Steinbrinck , and the torpedo boats T33 and <unk> , to Libau in present @-@ day Latvia . 
 The Soviet Navy examined the ship in great detail after she arrived in Libau . The cruiser was then renamed Admiral Makarov and assigned to the 8th Fleet , based in Tallinn . In late 1948 , she became the flagship of the 8th Fleet , under the command of Vice Admiral F. V. <unk> . In the early 1950s , three new Chapayev @-@ class cruisers entered service , which prompted the Soviet Navy to withdraw Admiral Makarov from front line duties . She returned to her old job as a training cruiser , this time based in Kronstadt in mid @-@ 1954 . During this period , most of her light anti @-@ aircraft armament was removed , and new radars were installed . Her ultimate fate is unclear ; she appears to have been placed out of service by May 1959 , and was scrapped some time thereafter , reportedly by mid @-@ 1960 . Nevertheless , she was the longest @-@ surviving major warship of the Kriegsmarine , and the only one to see active service after the end of the war . 
 = California State Route 11 = 
 State Route 11 ( SR 11 ) is a state route in San Diego County that is planned to connect SR 905 and SR 125 with the proposed new U.S. – Mexico border crossing at Otay Mesa East . Planning for the road began in the 1990s , and construction started in 2013 . As of 2016 , the portion from SR 905 to Enrico Fermi Drive is complete , with the rest of the road scheduled for completion in 2017 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 11 is proposed to be a toll facility that will serve a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa , the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry . It will connect SR 905 and SR 125 to the <unk> Tijuana @-@ Rosarito 2000 corridor that connects to Mexican Federal Highway 2D and Mexican Federal Highway 2 to Tecate , and Mexican Federal Highway 1D to Ensenada . 
 As of 2016 , the portion from SR 905 to Enrico Fermi Drive is completed . On that segment , plans were to construct two interchanges at Enrico Fermi Drive and Siempre Viva Road as the proposed route curves to the southeast before reaching the border crossing . SR 11 will operate as a toll road once the entire route is completed . 
 = = History = = 
 SR 11 was added to the state highway system in 1994 . Four years later , several parties , including District 11 of Caltrans , the City and County of San Diego , the San Diego Association of Governments , and Tijuana were signatories to a Letter of Intent to build the border crossing . The route was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1999 . In 2009 , Senate Bill 1486 was passed , and the presidential permit in 2008 allowed for the border crossing to be constructed . By one year later , several alternatives were considered , in terms of constructing some or even none of the interchanges , or removing the proposed toll on the route . State funding is allocated to cover much of the $ 400 million cost , which does not include the port of entry at another $ 350 million . The California Transportation Commission endorsed the project in January 2012 , and approved the proposed freeway route that December . 
 Plans are to construct the road in three stages : the interchange with SR 905 and the road to Enrico Fermi Drive , continuing the construction to the commercial vehicle facility , and building the border crossing itself . The first part of construction — connecting to SR 905 — started on December 10 , 2013 and was completed on March 19 , 2016 . The entire road is scheduled for completion by 2017 . Tolls are planned for the road in order to keep delays for crossing the border low , and this would vary depending on the current traffic at the other crossings in the area . The funds would go to both countries .

 = Samuel Turell Armstrong = 
 Samuel Turell Armstrong ( April 29 , 1784 – March 26 , 1850 ) was a U.S. political figure . Born in 1784 in Dorchester , Massachusetts , he was a printer and bookseller in Boston , specializing in religious materials . Among his works were an early stereotype edition of Scott 's Family Bible , which was very popular , and The <unk> , a religious magazine devoted to missionary interests . 
 Armstrong began to withdraw from the printing business in 1825 , and focused instead on politics . He was active in Boston politics during the 1820s , twice winning a seat in the Massachusetts General Court ( state legislature ) . In 1833 he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts as a Whig , and served three consecutive annual terms . For most of the last term he was Acting Governor after Governor John Davis resigned to take a seat in the United States Senate . He lost a bid to be elected governor in his own right in 1836 , but was elected Mayor of Boston , a post he held for one year . 
 = = Printer and bookseller = = 
 Samuel Armstrong was born on April 29 , 1784 in Dorchester , Massachusetts to John Armstrong and Elizabeth ( Williams ) Armstrong . His father , a military man , died when he was ten , and his mother died three years later . He was apprenticed to Manning and Loring , bookbinders and printers who were described as " the principal book @-@ printers in the town " of Boston . Following his apprenticeship he opened a print shop with a partner in Boston , but a few years later opened his own business in Charlestown . 
 In 1807 he was elected as a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts . He was elected as the first sergeant of the Company in 1811 . He also served as the captain of the Warren Phalanx of Charlestown from 1811 to 1814 . 
 In 1811 he returned the business to Boston , establishing a bookshop on Cornhill . His principal business was in the printing of religious tracts ; his most notable work was in publishing The <unk> , a religious magazine devoted to missionary matters . Another major success was his printing of the first stereotype edition of Scott 's Family Bible , a highly popular work that sold tens of thousands of copies . He also opened his bookshop for church @-@ related activities , including fundraising for foreign missionary work . 
 After he moved to Boston Armstrong took on two apprentices , Uriel Crocker and <unk> Brewster . In 1818 , upon the end of their apprenticeship , Armstrong turned over operation of the printing business to them ( which then became known as Crocker & Brewster ) and focused his activities on the bookshop . In 1825 , he withdrew from the day @-@ to @-@ day operations of the business , but would retain a financial stake until 1840 . He continued to maintain a personal interest in the business until his death . The business was a significant financial success , and made Armstrong fairly wealthy . 
 = = Church and politics = = 
 Armstrong was a member of the Old South Church . He served on its vestry ( including as its secretary ) , and was chosen deacon in 1829 . When the church was formally incorporated in 1844 Armstrong was named as one of its proprietors . In 1816 Armstrong discovered the original manuscript of the third volume of colonial Governor John Winthrop 's History of New England in the church 's tower ; the volume was presented to the Massachusetts Historical Society . He was also in part responsible for the church 's loss of a perfect specimen of the 17th century Bay Psalm Book , one of five that had been willed to the church by Thomas Prince , an early minister of the congregation . Writer Robert Wallace suggests that Armstrong 's trade of two copies of the book in exchange for offers by the recipients , George Livermore and Edward Crowninshield , to rebind the other copies was naive , and was essentially a scam by Livermore and Crowninshield ( both knowledgeable in the rare book trade ) to acquire the valuable books for a bargain price . 
 Armstrong was involved in civic affairs as early as 1812 , when he served in a Boston militia company during the War of 1812 . He entered state politics as a representative in Massachusetts General Court ( state legislature ) , serving in that body from 1822 – 1823 and in 1828 – 1829 . From 1828 to 1830 he served on Boston 's board of aldermen . In 1833 Armstrong was offered the nomination for lieutenant governor by the state Anti @-@ Masonic Party . Since he refused to subscribe to their view that Freemasonry should be abolished , he rejected the offer . He was , however , elected lieutenant governor on the Whig ticket , serving first under Levi Lincoln , Jr. and then John Davis . Whig newspapers used his working class roots to appeal to members of the Working Men 's Party , a third party founded on labor issues , describing him in the 1834 campaign as " a Mechanic and Workingman " . 
 When Davis resigned in March 1835 upon his election to the United States Senate , Armstrong served as the Acting Governor until 1836 . In the 1836 campaign Armstrong sought the Whig nomination for governor , but it went instead to Edward Everett in a bid for support from the Anti @-@ Masons . Armstrong ended up running that year without party support , and came in a distant third behind Everett and perennial Democratic candidate Marcus Morton . 
 In contrast to his defeat at the state level , Armstrong was elected Mayor of Boston in 1836 . The principal act of civic improvement during his one @-@ year administration was the construction of iron fencing around the Boston Common and the widening of the promenade along Boylston Street . Although the contracts for the work had been drawn up by the preceding administration of Theodore Lyman , Armstrong oversaw the work , and also had the task of securing the relocation of remains in the Central Burying Ground that were affected by the work . This he accomplished , despite some resistance from several families , by offering at no cost several new granite tombs to the affected parties . 
 In 1839 Armstrong was elected to the Massachusetts Senate , where he served a single term . In 1845 he joined the New England Historical and Genealogical Society , in whose affairs he remained involved until his death . He died in 1850 in Boston , and is buried in Cambridge 's Mount Auburn Cemetery . He had married Abigail Walker of Charlestown in 1812 ; they had no children . 
 = Hold It Against Me = 
 " Hold It Against Me " is a song performed by American singer Britney Spears for her seventh studio album , Femme Fatale ( 2011 ) . It was written and produced by Max Martin , Dr. Luke and Billboard , with additional writing by Bonnie McKee . Luke explained that he wanted " Hold It Against Me " to sound unlike his previous productions . The song was originally offered to Katy Perry , but Luke and Martin felt that it did not suit her . A demo version of the track by McKee was leaked on January 6 , 2011 , and the single became available for streaming on January 10 , 2011 . It was released the following day . 
 Musically , " Hold It Against Me " blends pulsating industrial and dance beats with elements of grime . The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats . The song features a dubstep @-@ influenced breakdown , in which Spears moans and blows kisses , and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave . The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor , and the chorus revolves around pick @-@ up lines . After the song was released , The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit " If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me " .

 " Hold It Against Me " was written and produced by Max Martin , Dr. Luke and Billboard , with additional writing by Bonnie McKee . After it was written , Luke and Martin wanted to give the track to American recording artist Katy Perry , but they decided that " it definitely wasn 't a Katy Perry record . " They continued to work on the song with Billboard ; Luke commented , " I wanted to make sure it didn 't sound like everything else I 've done . [ ... ] It can be hard in the verse , and the bridge is super , super hard , but the chorus is super @-@ pop . " After rumored lyrics for the song surfaced on the web , Luke commented in his Twitter account on December 9 , 2010 , " I / we never wrote a song called ' don 't hold it against me ' .... <unk> of <unk> info kids ; - ) We did write ' hold it against me ' but those lyrics are NOT the lyrics ....

 = = Composition = = 
 " Hold It Against Me " is three minutes and forty @-@ nine seconds long . It is a dance @-@ pop song that blends pulsating industrial and trance beats with elements of grime . Spears ' vocals have been described as " a bit treated " but not heavily Auto @-@ Tuned . The chorus , reminiscent of other pop productions by Max Martin , has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats . After the second chorus , the beats drop and Spears speaks the lines in the hook . This is followed by a dubstep @-@ influenced breakdown , which lasts about thirty seconds . Spears moans , blows kisses and sings the lines " Gimme something good , don 't wanna wait I want it now / Pop it like a hood and show me how you work it out . " " Hold It Against Me " continues with a second breakdown , which is more similar to the sound of the track . The final chorus has a smattering of rave chords and the song has a sudden end . 
 Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone commented that the song " recalls the synth @-@ gloom ambience of Britney 's 2007 gem , Blackout . " He also compared the riff to AC / DC 's " Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap " ( 1976 ) . The hook was noted by Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times to be reminiscent of " ( I Just ) Died in Your Arms " ( 1986 ) by Cutting Crew . Nick Levine of Digital Spy felt the song had a " clubby and au courant " feel , comparable to " Only Girl ( In the World ) " ( 2010 ) by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing Inc . , " Hold It Against Me " is set in the compound meter time signature , with a moderate dance beat infused metronome of 133 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of C minor ; Spears ' vocals range from the key of G3 to G5 . The song has a basic sequence of Cm – Fm – Cm – Fm as its chord progression . Lyrically , " Hold It Against Me " talks about seducing someone on the dancefloor . The chorus revolves around pick @-@ up lines ; Spears sings , " If I said I want your body now , would you hold it against me ? " and " ' Cause you feel like paradise , and I need a vacation tonight . " James Montgomery of MTV compared the feeling of the lyrics to that of " If U Seek Amy " ( 2009 ) . 
 After " Hold It Against Me " was released , The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit " If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me " . In a statement , David Bellamy said " professionally , well , in all honesty , we feel completely ripped off . Where 's the originality ? " The brothers 's attorney Christopher E. Schmidt stated that " [ it ] becomes somewhat uncanny if you simply double the beat of the Bellamy Brothers ' song and match it up with Britney 's version " and pointed out that it was not the first time Martin and Luke were accused of copyright infringement . On March 2 , 2011 , Martin , Luke , McKee and Billboard filed a lawsuit in which they accused the brothers of making defamatory and libelous statements about them . The case was dismissed on August 11 , 2011 . The Bellamy Brothers released a statement that said , " The Bellamy Brothers apologise to Dr. Luke and Max Martin for the <unk> ' public statements and any false impressions suggested by the statements on their website that Dr. Luke and Max Martin copy the works of others .

 " Hold It Against Me " has received positive reviews from most critics . Rick Florino of website Artistdirect gave the song four and half stars , calling it " one of Britney 's catchiest club bangers yet " and saying " [ it ] proudly stands alongside Britney classics like ' Womanizer ' , ' Gimme More ' , and ' Toxic ' , but there 's a refined ethereal elegance to it that sees Britney stepping into new territory and pushing the boundaries of dance pop once more . " Nick Levine of website Digital Spy said that although " Hold It Against Me " was produced by Luke and Martin , the finished product was not similar to songs by regular collaborators Kesha and Katy Perry , but actually " sounds like a bang @-@ up @-@ to @-@ date Britney tune for 2011 . " Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly said " ' Against Me ' is classic Britney — that is to say the vocal performance is far from stellar , but it serves as a nice accessory to [ Luke and Martin ] ' s thumping Euro techno groove . " He also added that Spears did not evolve with the lyrics she sings , and that there was not much growth when compared to singles such as " ... Baby One More Time " ( 1998 ) or " I 'm a Slave 4 U " ( 2001 ) . 
 Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented , " It ’ s one of the tougher @-@ sounding Spears singles yet and should do the job as a dancefloor @-@ filler for listeners who are starting to wear out on the latest singles from Katy Perry and The Black Eyed Peas " . However , he also dismissed the lyrical content and said that Spears sounds " bored [ ... ] as is the case with most of her recent work . " Michael Cragg of British newspaper The Guardian called it " decent enough . " Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone referred to the song as " prime Britney " and stated that it " promises great things for her album . " Jim Cantiello of MTV felt the use of pick @-@ up lines was silly , but praised the beat and the vocals , while calling the breakdown " awesome " . Jim Farber of the Daily News called it " a dance @-@ ready club song " and added , " With all that behind her , the ' Oops ' girl may yet do it again " , referencing her hit " Oops ! ...

Lamb stated , " The pop music of 2011 has an early shot in the arm here . [ ' Hold It Against Me ' ] will quickly take its place among Britney Spears ' best singles . " Music website Popjustice positively compared the song to the leaked demo , saying that although the lyrics and melody were not different , Spears ' finished version " is approximately 1000 times better than the demo . It 's a harder , more urgent , extremely epic statement track that sounds like the work of a superstar . " Glenn Gamboa of Newsday stated that " Hold It Against Me " was " a bit safer [ ... ] like her current low @-@ key , non @-@ tabloid persona . " Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail 's J.D. Considine called the reworking of The Bellamy Brothers ' song " lame " , but concluded that the track was " perfect ear candy " , calling it " lust made audible " .

 The music video for " Hold It Against Me " was filmed on January 22 and 23 , 2011 . It was directed by Jonas Åkerlund , while Brian Friedman served as the choreographer . According to Spears ' manager Larry Rudolph , she became a fan of Åkerlund 's work after seeing the video for Madonna 's " Ray of Light " ( 1998 ) , but they had not worked together in the past , owing to " his availability or her timing " . Spears and Åkerlund quickly got together to create the concept , presenting different ideas until , according to Rudolph , " [ the concept ] took a life on its own " . Open auditions were held on December 22 , 2010 , and the dancers had to learn a routine set to Robyn 's " Criminal Intent " ( 2010 ) . 
 On January 22 , 2011 , Spears tweeted from the video shoot , saying it was " an incredible experience " and would " be one of the best videos I have ever done . " On February 2 , 2011 , accusations came from TMZ.com that Åkerlund had decided to use a dance double for Spears when it seemed like she had not rehearsed her moves enough . Both her representatives and the director denied the rumors , and Åkerlund commenting , " [ Britney 's ] been great throughout the entire process . [ ... ] I 've been around long enough to know when an artist gives it their all , and to me it doesn 't get better than this . This video is gonna be fucking awesome ! It 's all Britney . " Her manager Larry Rudolph later confirmed that a body double was actually used , but only for the scenes in which Spears fights herself . The fight scene was choreographed by Steven Ho . He commented that Spears incorporated the moves learned during rehearsals , but also incorporated " her own flavor " , by adding a small shuffle of steps in her heels . The length of the dresses also presented a problem , and there were discussions about shortening the trains for safety issues . They were later added as ' weapons ' , as Ho explained , " as if they were sharp blades , giving Britney reason to jump and evade around them . " 
 Friedman revealed that Jonas ' wife , B. Åkerlund , was the stylist for the video . B. is known for her work with Madonna and Lady Gaga , but Friedman assured that " it is not ' Britney does Gaga . ' " B. later commented about the fashion of the video , saying , " We were going for a punk @-@ rock couture look in this video , with a touch of glam . " For the wedding dress scene , B. worked with Tom Tom fashions to create a custom @-@ made dress . Swarovski crystals were used for the " arm creations " ; a necklace by <unk> and gloves by La <unk> were added as accessories . For the fight scene , both Spears and her double wear custom dresses by B. , in collaboration with Falguni and Shane Peacock , and also sport stilettos by XTC . During her dance sequence , Spears wears an outfit created by B. and Skin Graft Designs , with jewelry by Tom Binns . The boots were Spears ' own , and completely bedazzled with Swarovski crystals . For the microphone sequence , Spears rocks a red look described as " skull shoulders " , designed by <unk> Hussein for Swarovski Runway Rocks . She completes the look with earrings and a necklace by Tom Binns and rings by Loree <unk> . For the finale scene , Spears wears a custom skintight black dress by <unk> , complete with garters .

 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The main idea behind the video is the rise , fall , and revival of Spears herself . The video begins when a meteoroid heads for Earth , and lights up a city when it finally lands , symbolizing Spears ' entrance to fame and her skyrocketing career in the late 1990s as she became a household name . After this , black @-@ and @-@ white interspersed scenes of Spears getting ready in a soundstage are shown , while the words " Britney Spears " and " Hold It Against Me " appear in Def Leppard @-@ inspired multicolored letters . Spears is then seen wearing shorts and showing her midriff in the soundstage , while her dancers in white are getting dressed around her . They are surrounded by cameras and lights , symbolizing her constantly being under the microscope and hounded by the media . As the first chorus begins , Spears appears wearing a white wedding dress inside a cylinder @-@ shaped metal room with wires . The futuristic set and flowing dress are reminiscent of Madonna 's music video for " Bedtime Story " ( 1995 ) . She is seen rising up the cylinder @-@ shaped metal room and her past music videos surround her , symbolizing her ever growing career in the music industry ( and possibly referring to the carousel of Logan 's run ) . When the second verse begins , Spears sings , wearing sparkly red skull @-@ shaped shoulder pads , with microphones around her . 
 A pastiche of following scenes alternates between Spears dancing on the soundstage , singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips , a reference to the opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show . This begins to show her losing grip , reminiscent of her break down . When the breakdown starts , she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers , staining the room and the monitors , symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted . Then , two versions of Spears , both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains , are seen fighting each other , another symbolism , this time of her fighting her inner demons . After this , both versions of Spears , as well as her on the wedding dress , fall exhausted to the ground , symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown . While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown , the other versions of herself start to wake up , showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback , refusing to give up . The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage , with confetti and pyrotechnics around them . In the final shot a question mark ( ? ) appears in multicolored letters . This final scene shows her as she once was , a superstar who is back to reclaim her title . The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark , symbolizing the unknown that is to come .

 = Thomas Cushing = 
 Thomas Cushing III ( March 24 , 1725 – February 28 , 1788 ) was an American lawyer , merchant , and statesman from Boston , Massachusetts . Active in Boston politics , he represented the city in the provincial assembly from 1761 to its dissolution in 1774 , serving as the lower house 's speaker for most of those years . Because of his role as speaker , his signature was affixed to many documents protesting British policies , leading officials in London to consider him a dangerous radical . He engaged in extended communications with Benjamin Franklin who at times lobbied on behalf of the legislature 's interests in London , seeking ways to reduce the rising tensions of the American Revolution . 
 Cushing represented Massachusetts in the First and Second Continental Congresses , but was voted out when he opposed independence . Despite this , he remained politically active after independence , continuing to serve in the state government . During the war he was a commissary responsible for provisioning the military , a position he used to enrich the family merchant business . He was elected the state 's first Lieutenant Governor in 1780 . Politically associated with fellow merchant and governor John Hancock , he remained lieutenant governor until his death in 1788 , briefly serving as Acting Governor in 1785 between the resignation of Hancock and the election of James Bowdoin . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Thomas was born in Boston , the capital of the British Province of Massachusetts Bay , on March 24 , 1725 , the second of at least seven children . The Cushing family , with deep roots in the province , descends from Deacon Matthew Cushing who emigrated from Norfolk , England , to Hingham in 1638 . Thomas ' father , also named Thomas ( 1694 @-@ 1746 ) , was one of the city 's wealthiest merchants , a leading member of the Old South Church , and a city selectman . Thomas Sr. was a frequent moderator of town meetings , and accepted on behalf of the city of Boston the gift of Faneuil Hall ( a large market building and public meeting space ) from Peter Faneuil in 1742 . He served in the General Court ( colonial assembly ) of Massachusetts from 1731 to 1747 , and as its speaker after 1742 . His mother , Mary ( Bromfield ) Cushing ( 1689 – 1746 ) was also from a prominent Boston family . 
 Thomas got his early education at the Boston Latin School , and then attended Harvard , where he graduated in 1744 . He studied law and was admitted to the bar , after which he entered the family merchant business . On October 1 , 1747 , he married Deborah Fletcher ( c . 1727 – 1790 ) , with whom he had five children . 
 = = Political career = = 
 In 1753 Cushing entered politics , winning election as a Boston selectman . He continued in that office until 1763 , and was also elected to the General Court in 1761 . He became politically associated with Samuel Adams and John Hancock , in part through his attendance at political discussions in Boston 's taverns . With Hancock in particular he eventually formed a lifelong relationship in which the charismatic Hancock was always seen to be the dominant political personality . He contributed financially to some of Hancock 's political spending , although he preferred to stand in the background and let Hancock receive the credit . Because of this his ( and Hancock 's ) political opponents in later years often characterized him as little more than Hancock 's henchman or proxy . 
 When the French and Indian War came to an end in 1763 the British government sought to recover the costs of posting troops in the colonies by imposing taxes on the colonies . Cushing was an early opponent of these taxes , couching his opposition in economic terms , a reflection on his livelihood as a merchant . An astute observer of the trade ties binding the various parts of the British Empire , he wrote in 1763 that extant high duties on molasses ( payment of which was widely flouted by New England merchants ) would have significantly harmed the economies of Britain , North America , and the West Indies , in part by diverting significant quantities of scarce hard currency to those duties . John Adams wrote of Cushing that " [ He ] is steady and constant and busy in the interest of liberty and the opposition , and is famed for secrecy and his talent for procuring intelligence . " 
 = = = Speaker of the house = = = 
 In May 1766 Cushing was chosen to be speaker of the assembly . The assembly first chose James Otis , but Governor Bernard rejected this choice , and Cushing was named as a compromise candidate . During his tenure as speaker he was a frequent correspondent with the assembly 's agent in London , Benjamin Franklin , who was given the job in late 1770 . In addition to official correspondence such as petitions , the two men exchanged opinions on political developments in their respective areas , and were broadly in agreement on the need for moderation in dealing with the British government . In 1772 Franklin acquired letters written by several royal appointees , including Governor Thomas Hutchinson when he was still lieutenant governor . Seeking to deflect colonial blame for matters away from the British government and onto the royal governor , Franklin forwarded these letters to Cushing , with specific instructions that they only be shown to a few people . Those who saw them included the radical Samuel Adams , who engineered their eventual publication in 1773 . In the letters , Hutchinson and Lieutenant Governor Andrew Oliver made highly inflammatory suggestions that colonial rights needed to be abridged . The resulting scandal inflamed political tensions on both sides of the Atlantic , prompted a petition from the assembly that Hutchinson be recalled , and brought about Franklin 's resignation as colonial agent and conversion to a pro @-@ independence view after he was publicly lambasted for his role in the affair . 
 Cushing held the post of speaker until the assembly was dissolved in October 1774 by Governor and British Army General Thomas Gage , who succeeded Hutchinson . The assembly 's members then met without the governor 's permission and formed the Massachusetts Provincial Congress . This body would constitute the de facto government of Massachusetts until its state constitution was adopted in 1780 . 
 Despite his opposition to British policies Cushing did not at first strongly support the revolution . In 1772 , he ( along with Hancock , who was also then moderate in his views ) refused to serve when named to one of the Boston Committees of Correspondence . Despite his lack of revolutionary ardor he was elected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 , and to the second in 1775 . He became associated with the radical cause by London political figures in part because , as Massachusetts speaker , his signature was affixed to all of its petitions . As a result , orders issued to General Gage in April 1775 for the arrest of radical leaders included Cushing 's name . Gage did not pursue such orders for the arrest of leaders , and Cushing was never detained . 
 = = = Revolution = = = 
 Cushing continued to maintain a weak attitude toward independence through 1775 , which cost him his seat in the Continental Congress in December 1775 . After a heated election campaign Cushing was defeated by Elbridge Gerry , who was committed to independence . The loss , which decisively handed pro @-@ independence forces a majority in the Massachusetts delegation , propelled Cushing firmly into Hancock 's camp . Cushing continued to oppose independence upon his return to Massachusetts , orchestrating delays in the polling process by which the state formally called for a declaration of independence . 
 Hancock , then the president of the Continental Congress , rewarded Cushing 's loyalty by securing for him the appointment as a commissioner of marine affairs . In this role Cushing oversaw the procurement of two 32 @-@ gun frigates for the Continental Navy . He was also appointed the chief commissary responsible for supplying Massachusetts troops , a post he held for several years . In 1780 he was appointed as one of the chief <unk> responsible for supplying the French troops at Newport , Rhode Island . Cushing , in behavior that was similar to that of other merchants involved in military supply , used these positions to substantially enrich the family merchant business by granting it favorably priced supply contracts . He was also involved in regional conventions that attempted to stem the inflationary decline in value of the Continental dollar by setting wage and price controls ; these attempts failed because states refused to implement convention recommendations . 
 In 1778 Cushing was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to create a new constitution for the state . This effort was rejected by the state 's eligible voters for a variety of reason , although there continued to be calls from the towns demanding a new constitution . Cushing was not involved in the detailed drafting of the state constitution that was adopted in 1780 . He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( 1780 ) . 
 = = = President of the Massachusetts Senate = = = 
 Cushing was elected to the Massachusetts Senate the 1780 election . As several districts failed to elect senators and several others refused to serve , there were only nineteen senators sworn in for the first Senate session of 1780 . On October 25 , 1780 , of the nineteen senators who had been sworn in , fourteen voted for Cushing , and Cushing was elected the first President of the Massachusetts Senate . Cushing resigned as President of the Massachusetts Senate on November 4 , 1780 in order to become the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts . 
 = = = Lieutenant Governor = = = 
 Cushing stood for election as lieutenant governor in the 1780 election . The vote was indecisive ( no candidate received a majority of the votes cast ) , and the choice was given to the General Court to decide . Its first candidate , James Bowdoin , refused the post , as did the second choice , James Warren , and the choice went to Cushing on the third ballot . He then served in the post , most of the time serving under his friend John Hancock , until his death in 1788 . In early 1785 Hancock offered his resignation to the legislature , partly as a political maneuver ( although he claimed to be suffering a particularly bad case of gout at the time ) . The legislature did not insist that Hancock remain in office , resulting in Hancock actually resigning . Cushing became Acting Governor and served out the last few months of the term . The 1785 election for governor was highly political and divisive ; Cushing was portrayed by his opponents ( principally Bowdoin and his supporters ) as little more than a creature of Hancock who would do Hancock 's bidding . The election was again undecided by the electorate ; Bowdoin prevailed in the General Court 's decision @-@ making , and Cushing again won the lieutenant governor 's office . Bowdoin served two terms , which were dominated by Shays ' Rebellion , an uprising caused in part by Bowdoin 's harsh fiscal policies and poor economic conditions in the rural parts of the state . In 1787 Hancock returned to politics , <unk> Bowdoin . In each of these elections Cushing was reelected as lieutenant governor . 
 During their time in office Hancock and Cushing funded the rebuilding of Boston , which had been devastated by the British occupation in 1775 – 76 . Although Hancock was given most of the credit for this effort , it is known that Cushing played a significant role in the rebuilding effort .

 = Triangle ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Triangle " is the third episode of the sixth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files and premiered on the Fox network on November 22 , 1998 . Written and directed by series creator Chris Carter , " Triangle " is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " episode , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the overarching mythology of The X @-@ Files . " Triangle " earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 @.@ 8 , being watched by 18 @.@ 20 million viewers in its initial broadcast . The episode generally received positive reviews , with many critics commenting on the episode 's unique directing style . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , and the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . However , the two have developed a close friendship . In this episode , Mulder races to a luxury passenger liner which has mysteriously appeared on the edge of the Bermuda Triangle . Once there , he realizes he has traveled back in time to September 3 , 1939 — the outbreak of World War II . German soldiers have boarded the ship in search of " Thor 's Hammer " , something that could ensure victory in the coming conflict . Meanwhile , Scully , after being informed of Mulder 's disappearance by The Lone Gunmen , rushes through the J. Edgar Hoover Building , looking for someone who can help find her missing partner . 
 " Triangle " is notable for the unique style in which it was filmed . Inspired by the 1948 Alfred Hitchcock film Rope , with many shots filmed and edited to appear as one single take . In addition , " Triangle " features the main and recurring cast members such as Anderson , William B. Davis , Chris Owens , James Pickens Jr. and Mitch Pileggi , who played their contemporary characters as well as distinctly different characters from 1939 on board the luxury liner . Several of the episode 's themes have been critically examined — the concept of " dream @-@ nazis " , the appearance of modern characters portraying those from the past , and the ramification that the entire episode was a dream . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) lies unconscious in the sea after wrecking his raft . He is taken aboard a passenger ship , the Queen Anne , by its British crew members . When he is sent to meet the captain , Mulder tries to explain that the Queen Anne vanished in the Bermuda Triangle in 1939 , and claims that it has reappeared in 1998 . The crew dismisses Mulder 's story and suspect he is a Nazi spy . At that moment , the Queen Anne is boarded by SS troops under the control of a Standartenführer resembling The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) , who sets the ship 's course for Nazi Germany . The crew of the Queen Anne lock Mulder in the captain 's quarters , where he listens to a radio broadcast announcing the start of World War II . Mulder realizes that the Queen Anne did not travel to 1998 ; he has traveled back to 1939 . 
 Meanwhile , in the present , The Lone Gunmen inform Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) that they have lost contact with Mulder , who had set out in search of the Queen Anne . Scully first turns to Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) , unsuccessfully , then attempts to confront Assistant Director Alvin Kersh ( James Pickens , Jr . ) . She finally threatens Agent Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) before Skinner shows up and provides her with the information from the Pentagon . Scully leaves with the Gunmen to find Mulder . On the Queen Anne , a British sailor tells Mulder that the Germans are looking for what they believe is a weapon called " Thor 's Hammer " . Mulder tells him that Thor 's Hammer is not a weapon , but a scientist that will build a weapon . The sailor , however , turns out to be a German spy and locks Mulder in the engine room with the ship 's crew . One of the sailors , who strongly resembles Kersh , decides to steer the boat to Jamaica , but Mulder tells them to sail back where they came from , in order to pass through the time warp and re @-@ appear in 1998 . 
 Eventually , Mulder is taken to the ballroom by the Nazis . Once there , he is ordered to identify the scientist , or the Nazis will begin shooting passengers . After they have killed two men , a woman who looks strikingly like Scully tells the Nazis that they are killing innocent people for nothing , and that Mulder knows nothing . Mulder tells the Nazis that one of the men they shot was the scientist , but the true scientist steps forward . The Nazis prepare to execute Mulder and " Scully " , but before they are able , the engine is shut down . British sailors descend upon the ballroom and begin fighting the Nazis . In the midst of the chaos , Mulder and " Scully " escape . Meanwhile , Scully and the Lone Gunmen find the Queen Anne and board it , only to find that it is an empty ghost ship . 
 Back in 1939 , as the British sailors fight the Nazis in the ballroom , Mulder tells " Scully " that she has to turn the ship around and return to the Bermuda Triangle in order to get the ship out of the rift in space . Mulder grabs " Scully " and kisses her , " in case they never meet again " . " Scully " punches him , and he jumps overboard . Mulder wakes up in 1998 in a hospital , surrounded by Scully , the Lone Gunmen and Skinner . Mulder attempts to tell them that he traveled to 1939 , and of his encounter with Nazis , and tells Scully that she was there with him , but they all think he is delirious . After Skinner and the Gunmen leave , Mulder calls Scully back and tells her that he loves her . Scully thinks his confession is an effect of the drugs he has been given , rolls her eyes and leaves . As he lies down , Mulder winces as his cheek touches the pillow ; the spot where " Scully " punched him in 1939 is still sore .

 = = = Conception , writing , and filming = = = 
 The X @-@ Files creator Chris Carter developed the idea for " Triangle " while working on the fifth season episode " The Red and the Black " . Carter had used more film shooting that episode than any other director in the series ' history but Kim Manners . The crew made Carter a mock trophy , which inspired him to write an episode that featured continuous action as a way to minimize film usage . Carter designed " Triangle " in a style similar to Alfred Hitchcock 's 1948 film Rope . Initially , Fox executives were hesitant to green @-@ light production for " Triangle " because it was expected to exceed the $ 2 @.@ 5 million episode budget . To persuade them , Carter told the executives that the episode would feature elements of Hitchcock 's directing style , a move he later called " an easy hook " . Carter also cited the 1964 Twilight Zone adaptation of " An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge " as inspiration . 
 The scenes on board the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous passenger liner RMS Queen Mary , which has long been used as a hotel . The X @-@ Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary , and erected wrap @-@ around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach , California . To make it look like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge , the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water . Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship 's corridors and ballroom , Carter had portions of the ship <unk> and redecorated to give the finished episode a late @-@ 1930s style . 
 In an interview before the episode was finished , Gillian Anderson said she was most looking forward to the scene in which Scully works her way through FBI headquarters in her quest to locate Mulder . She later compared the episode to live theater , which she had worked in previously . The four acts of " Triangle " were filmed in several continuous shots , and edited together to give the impression of four seamless acts . This included the scenes in the FBI ; when the actors entered the stage elevator , the set that they would next move onto had to be constructed behind the closed doors . Many times during filming , these doors would open before the set behind had been completed , which ruined the shot . 
 For authenticity , several British and German actors portrayed the British sailors and Nazi soldiers , whose dialogue was mostly in German . Trevor Goddard , who portrayed the First British Crewman , is English , while Madison Mason , who played Captain Yip Harburg , is American ; he affected an English accent for the part . William B. Davis ' dialogue was entirely in German , a language which he did not speak . He later explained , " I certainly didn 't realize I was going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script , which just said ' CSM ( in German ) ' . " To successfully learn his lines , one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis ' dialogue onto a cassette . Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines ; he noted that the method " seemed to work pretty well — at least to non @-@ German @-@ speaking people ! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show , which I thought was a little unfair . " The only main cast member of The X @-@ Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi . Pileggi had studied in Germany ; he had to re @-@ write many of his lines as they made no sense in the context of the scenes . The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode , " The Truth is Out There " , was translated into German : " Die Wahrheit ist <unk> da <unk> " . 
 = = = Directing style = = = 
 Filmed in real time , the episode is designed to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven @-@ minute takes . Carter explained , " I said [ to the cast and crew ] ' Wouldn 't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time if we just did an episode where we did four 11 @-@ minute takes and put it all together ? ' And everyone looked at me like I was nuts . " To film the episode , camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam . However , the steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film , so discreet edits and cuts were necessary . Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football , " You 'd have a game on Friday , and you 'd wake up Saturday and really feel it . " The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark . With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne , the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes , when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods . Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect , but , for example , of the takes made on the eighth day of filming , only two of ten were deemed satisfactory . 
 The final two acts of the episode feature a sophisticated split @-@ screen mise en scène . However , rather than displaying two different events , each side of the screen shows the same event from almost identical angles . When Scully runs around the corner in the present day , she does so at the same time as Mulder and the 1939 version of Scully . This was filmed in such a way that as the actors pass each other in the hallway , they also pass into the opposite frame of the split screen . This effect was inspired by the music video for <unk> 's hit 1998 single " Closing Time . " 
 Both the cast and crew admitted that filming an episode of The X @-@ Files in real time was physically and mentally exhausting . Duchovny later joked that , after filming concluded , he " could win an Emmy for most bruises . " Gillian Anderson described the real time directing style as " challenging . " She said , " I 'm realizing how comfortable and connected I am to the rhythm we 're used to . " Tom Braidwood , who played Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike and was an assistant director on the show , called Davis ' role " brutal " and noted that " It was really tough for William because he had to learn all this German . " Davis later joked that " Maybe we shouldn 't try to do two clever things at once . I think it worked fine , but it was a struggle to do it . " 
 Editor Louise Innes , who was working on her first X @-@ Files episode , said the post @-@ production editing process was " not as easy as it sounds . " Innes was tasked with connecting roughly forty shots and creating the illusion of one , uniform scene . After the reels of film were combined , several pending issues had to be tweaked in post @-@ production . For instance , during the scene in which Scully runs into an elevator , two shots were spliced together ; however , the color did not completely match . The images and their colors were later corrected by the series ' " postproduction [ sic ] troubleshooters " using digital manipulation . When the episode was filmed , it was shot in 2 @.@ 35 : 1 widescreen . When the episode aired , it was shown letterboxed to fit in a 1 @.@ 33 : 1 television screen ; this was the first X @-@ Files episode to receive this treatment . Carter reasoned that this method would allow for more action to be viewable in each frame . 
 = = = Music and cultural references = = = 
 To get a feel for the era , X @-@ Files composer Mark Snow listened to the big band music of Gene Krupa , Glenn Miller , Tommy Dorsey , and Harry James . The " bouncy instrumental " that plays during the fight scene in the ballroom was inspired by a similar swing tune composed by John Williams for the 1979 Steven Spielberg film 1941 . Snow later joked that his composition was " the third generation of the same inspiration . " Carter had significant musical input when it came to scene transitions , saying , " I got a chance to use some of my favorite ' 40s music here , too , or ' 30s and ' 40s music to transition scenes . " The song that is heard near the end of the ballroom fight and in the scene featuring Scully and the Lone Gunmen searching for the Queen Anne is a piece of stock music called " Hot Liquorice " , composed by Dick Walters . Producer Paul Rabwin oversaw a special arrangement of the 1938 jazz standard " <unk> Creepers " , which was included in the ballroom scene . 
 The episode contains many intentional references to the 1939 musical film The Wizard of Oz . The ship 's captain is named after the film 's lyricist Yip Harburg , and the ballroom singer , Almira Gulch , after The Wizard of Oz character who is the analog for the Wicked Witch of the West . Her band is The Lollipop Guild , a reference to a section of the song " Ding @-@ Dong ! The Witch Is Dead " , while Mulder 's wrecked ship is called the Lady Garland , after Judy Garland . The final scene of " Triangle " , which features Mulder in bed telling his friends and co @-@ workers that he saw them in his reverie , bears a striking resemblance to the closing scene of Oz . Because of this , the scene was called " obviously derivative " by one reviewer . Further , when Mulder mentions that Skinner was with him in 1939 , which is the year The Wizard of Oz was released , Skinner replies " with my dog Toto " , and Scully tells him " there 's no place like home " . 
 The episode features several historical errors . Anderson 's 1939 character is said to work for the Office of Strategic Services , which was not established until 1942 . The code name " Thor 's Hammer " is an invention of the writers . Lee Smith , the official researcher for the show , was tasked with finding the name for the secret pre @-@ WWII atomic research project . Unfortunately for the show , the actual code name , Development of Substitute Materials , was considered " uninspiring , " so the name " Thor 's Hammer " was created instead . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , examined the characterization of the villains in the episode and the meta @-@ references to the series . Shearman and Pearson note that the episode makes a distinct difference when portraying the Nazis on @-@ screen . Instead of showing them as " real Nazis " — as portrayed in third season episodes like " Paper Clip " — this episode portrays them as deliberately exaggerated " dream @-@ nazis " . The two argue that the villains are played as " comic book nasties " and are similar in style to the villains from the Indiana Jones movie franchise . 
 Shearman and Pearson analyzed the portrayals of several of the series ' regular characters as 1930s villains , noting several meta @-@ references to the wider series . The two noted that , in his portrayal of a Nazi , Jeffrey Spender was allowed to " cut loose and rant like a proper villain rather than a sulky boy hiding in the basement . " In contrast , Walter Skinner 's 1939 character behaved more like his character in the wider series , his role " charmingly parodying the ambiguity he 's been playing all these years and turning out to be an American @-@ loving ally who tells our heroes to get their ' asses out of here ' . " 
 Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations : An Unauthorized Look at Season 6 – 9 of The X @-@ Files , critically examined the ideas that the entire episode was either a dream or existed in some sort of " parallel universe " . Kessenich reasons that , because the episode contains several overt references to The Wizard of Oz and the fact that Chris Carter noted that the episode was based on the idea of Mulder 's subconscious mind at work , much of " Triangle " was simply a dream . Furthermore , Kessenich backs up his argument by pointing out that many of the characters on the ship were played by familiar faces — The Smoking Man as the Nazi leader , Spender as a Nazi " lap dog " , Skinner as a double agent , Kersh as an " unfamiliar friend or foe " , and Scully as Mulder 's ultimate ally . This would suggest , according to Kessenich , that the entire episode was acted out in Mulder 's mind while he was unconscious in the Bermuda Triangle .

 When the finished program was shown to the cast and crew , their response was very positive . Gillian Anderson said , " I never quite understood whether it was going to work or not . When we finally saw ' Triangle ' after this new way of filming everything , a style that we 'd never attempted before , as well as trying new scenes ... trying this , trying that ... that was terrific . " Chris Owens , who portrayed the Agent Spender Nazi lookalike , said , " One thing I really like about The X @-@ Files was that they were always challenging themselves . Chris [ Carter ] would write an episode in which we 're going to do Rope without any cuts , seemingly . A great challenge for a cast and crew . " 
 The episode received generally positive critical reviews from the press . Matt Zoller Seitz from The Star @-@ Ledger gave an overwhelmingly positive review of " Triangle " . Applauding Carter 's risky and audacious direction , he noted that " there has never been an hour of TV that looks or moves like ' Triangle ' " . He argued that the 1939 scene where Mulder and " Scully " cross paths with present @-@ Scully was " the greatest minute of TV this year " . Seitz also compared the episode to three @-@ dimensional video games , like Doom , Quake , and Castle Wolfenstein , citing the episode 's " gloomy corridors " and " nightmarish cartoon Nazis " . Michael Liedtke and George Avalos from The Charlotte Observer predicted that " ' Triangle ' seems destined to take its rightful place in the pantheon of greatest ' X @-@ Files ' episodes " . Enjoying the plethora of Wizard of Oz references , the two parodied a portion of " Over the Rainbow " in their column . Not all reviewers were so positive ; for Alan Sepinwall , " Triangle " was the episode " that turned out to be a dream " , making it " technically impressive but dramatically murky " . 
 = = = Later reception = = = 
 Several years after its initial broadcast , " Triangle " has continued to receive positive reviews , with many critics calling it one of the show 's best episodes . Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A – . Earl Cressey from DVD Talk called it one of the highlights of season six . Shearman and Pearson rated the episode five stars out of five and called it a " shining gem of an episode . " 
 Carter 's <unk> of " Triangle " received mostly favorable critical attention . Shearman and Pearson praised his directing , pointing to the scene where Scully dashes through the FBI building as " the best scene of all " . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club , in an " A " grade review , appreciated the unique style of filming , and wrote that the long scenes give " the whole thing a sense of urgency that propels scenes that shouldn 't work " . In addition , he called the split @-@ screen shot " darn near perfect " ; VanDerWerff later labeled it " one of my favorite moments in the whole show " . Andrew Payne from Starpulse applauded the acting and directing , saying , " Chris Carter rarely directed his creation , leaving that mostly to Kim Manners , but when he did he showed a brilliant eye not usually seen on broadcast TV . This is the best example — a breathlessly @-@ paced episode in which each act appears as one continuous shot . ... This episode is a lot of fun , particularly in the act that finds Scully blitzing through the FBI building in order to get some information on Mulder 's whereabouts . The acting is superb and nothing can beat those no @-@ cut acts . " Payne ultimately named it the fourth best X @-@ Files episode . David Boston from Made Man wrote that " we know whenever [ Chris Carter ] directs an episode it is always among the best . " Timothy Sexton from Yahoo ! Voices praised the split @-@ screen scene and the scene featuring Scully running through the FBI building , comparing it favorably to Orson Welles ' 1958 film Touch of Evil . Jonathan Dunn , writing for What Culture , described " Triangle " as " great " and included it in the " 5 Episodes [ of The X @-@ Files ] That Could Be Made Into Movies " list . In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon , containing fan @-@ selected episodes , " Triangle " was presented as the " Best Chris Carter @-@ Directed Episode " . Not all reviews were as glowing ; Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique wrote that " everyone certainly deserves an A for effort " , she was unimpressed by the " vertiginous camerawork " and " endless , monotonous tracking shots up and down hallways " . She ultimately awarded it one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . 
 In addition , many reviewers were pleased with the style and concept of " Triangle " . Tom Kessenich lauded the atmosphere of the entry , calling it " 60 minutes of The X @-@ Files at its finest " . Kessenich noted that , despite the " gloom and doom " talk that the series was heading in the wrong direction , stylistically , the episode proved " just how exciting this show can be " . He ultimately concluded that it was " a wonderful blend of fantasy and reality " that allowed the viewer " to try and ascertain what is real and what is not . " He later named " Triangle " one of the " Top 25 Episode of All Time " of The X @-@ Files , and ranked it in second place . VanDerWerff noted that he thoroughly enjoyed the concept , pointing out that the " sheer level of crazy stuff that goes on in this episode makes it fun to watch " . He wrote that " [ n ] othing else had ever been this skillfully done on television before " , which resulted in a " terrific episode of television " . Furthermore , he opined that " [ e ] verything comes together in the episode 's fantastically entertaining final act " , due to the presence of the dramatic fight scene , among others . 
 " Triangle " is also notable for featuring the first kiss between Mulder and Scully . In a positive critique , Kerry Fall from DVD Journal wrote that the entry was made particularly notable , in and of itself , due to the presence of the kiss . Kessenich opined that the kiss built off " the seeds that were planted in the movie ... Scully clearly believes this is a man lost in delirium , but Mulder ... is finally beginning to deal with some pretty powerful feelings he has for his partner . " Paula Vitaris , on the other hand , was frustrated ; she complained " [ w ] hen are these kisses that are not kisses going to end ? "

 = Grayrigg derailment = 
 The Grayrigg derailment was a fatal railway accident that occurred at approximately 20 : 15 GMT on 23 February 2007 , just to the south of Grayrigg , Cumbria , in the North West England region of the United Kingdom . The initial conclusion of the accident investigation is that the derailment was caused by a faulty set of points ( number 2B ) on the Down Main running line , controlled from Lambrigg ground frame . The scheduled inspection on 18 February 2007 had not taken place and the faults had gone undetected . 
 Although the accident killed far fewer people than some other accidents on the West Coast Main Line , it had a major negative impact on Network Rail 's safety record . 
 = = Incident = = 
 The 17 : 30 Virgin West Coast Pendolino West Coast Main Line InterCity service from London Euston to Glasgow Central derailed at 20 : 15 by a faulty set of points almost immediately after crossing the Docker Viaduct ( the rear half of the train would still have been crossing the bridge whilst the front derailed at the points ) . The train was reported to have been travelling at 153 km / h ( 95 mph ) when it was derailed . The train , consisting of unit 390 033 City of Glasgow , which was constructed at Washwood Heath , Birmingham in 2002 , had nine carriages and carried 105 passengers and four staff members . 
 Passengers said that the carriages of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment , with the first carriages jack @-@ knifing and most of the train coming to rest in a field . The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight . Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there was no one still inside . Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene , along with at least 12 ambulances , at least five fire engines , three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters , the International Rescue Corps , three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team , and one Merseyside Police helicopter . The rescue operation was hindered by rain , darkness , and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields . Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions , needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud . The train 's derailment caused severe damage to the Overhead Line Equipment and tripped the entire circuit between Brock ( near Preston ) and Tebay resulting in a number of other electric @-@ powered services coming to a halt and all signalling equipment immediately turning to danger ( red ) in accordance with the system 's fail safe design . 
 Live BBC television coverage at 08 : 15 the following morning showed that although the whole train had been derailed , the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast . Standard class , the front five carriages , were the worst affected , and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition . The leading carriage , a driving motor coach , had headed down the embankment , and turned end @-@ for @-@ end as it fell . It was lying on its side at the foot of the embankment . The second carriage had jack @-@ knifed against the first , breaking the coupling , and so had not followed it down the bank . This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track , at a steep angle with one end in the air . The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment . All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact , with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends . None of the windows broke , and lighting remained in all the carriages . Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages . The driver , who had stayed at the controls ( but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment ) , was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab . The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train . 
 Survivors were initially received at Grayrigg Primary School , which had been opened as a Survivor Reception Centre . Hospitals in the area , including some over the Scottish border in Dumfries and Galloway , were put on standby , but not all received patients . According to BBC News , five passengers were admitted to Royal Preston Hospital in a critical condition . Police later released a statement revealing that one passenger , 84 @-@ year @-@ old Margaret Masson from Glasgow , had died in hospital . Her funeral took place on 31 March 2007 at Craigton crematorium in Glasgow .

 A family liaison centre was set up in Glasgow Central Station for worried relatives . 
 Within three hours of the derailment the site of the accident had been sealed off with a five @-@ mile cordon . The line was expected to be closed for two weeks , with Virgin Trains saying that the line would not reopen to passenger services until 12 March 2007 . The recovery operation was slowed by problems in getting heavy lifting gear to the site which required temporary roads to be constructed . 
 Sir Richard Branson , Virgin Group chairman , visited the site of the derailment at 11 : 00 the following morning to comment on the incident . During his news conference at the site he said that he regarded the driver , named as Iain Black from Dumbarton , as a hero , as he had attempted to stop the train and remained in his seat to ensure the safety of passengers . Black left hospital in late March and stated that " I 've got to be in the cab to help the train and it never crossed my mind to leave . " 
 Branson also later thanked local residents for their help at the accident site , describing how he " was very impressed to hear how those kind people rallied round , opening their hearts and opening their doors to strangers in distress " . Local farmers assisted the emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four @-@ wheel drive vehicles . Sergeant Jo Fawcett of the Cumbria Constabulary also offered thanks , saying that " There are so many people who have given up their own time to contribute in some way to dealing with the aftermath of the derailment that it would be unfair to name them for fear of missing someone out . " 
 Branson also paid tribute to the Pendolino train , comparing it to a " tank " . He also added " If the train had been old stock then the number of injuries and the mortalities would have been horrendous " . Several sources also gave their praise due to the fact that the carriages generally stayed intact during the accident . 
 As a result of the suspicion that faulty points were the cause of the Grayrigg Derailment , Network Rail checked over 700 sets of similar points across the country as a " precautionary measure " saying later that " nothing of concern " had been found . 
 The operation to remove the train from the site began on the evening of 1 March 2007 with the first carriages moved from the embankment . This allowed passengers ' property to be retrieved and gave investigators access to the train interior , which previously had not been possible because it would have been unsafe . The last of the carriages were removed on 4 March 2007 and the <unk> road was reopened . 
 The points which caused the derailment , and points 2A on the opposite line , were removed from the track following the derailment and the line is now welded continuously for 2 @.@ 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 5 km ) including the line over the Docker viaduct . 
 The derailment also brought down the overhead line equipment which had to be replaced . Modern double @-@ line catenary from a single stand was used for this , which reduces the risk of carriages bending if a derailment occurs , for example becoming wedged between the overhead line stanchions as seen in the Southall crash . 
 In 2013 the British Transport Police ( BTP ) posthumously awarded a Chief Constables Commendation to a member of its staff , Jon Ratcliffe , who was at the time of the disaster Media and Marketing Manager for BTP 's North Western Area . He received the commendation for his good handling of media enquires in the aftermath of the crash . Jon Ratcliffe died in 2008 following a sudden illness .

 Lambrigg ground frame , 660 yards ( 600 m ) south @-@ west of the accident site , controls two crossovers , each one comprising two sets of points allowing trains to cross from one running line to the other in emergencies or during track maintenance work . These points are used only occasionally , operated locally after a release is obtained from Carlisle power signal box . They are normally locked in the main line " running " position . Early statements by Chief Superintendent Martyn Ripley of British Transport Police suggested that investigations would focus on these points . 
 Investigations were launched by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and Her Majesty 's Railway Inspectorate . RMT rail union leader Bob Crow said on BBC News that a points failure was responsible for the incident . Experts compared the cause to that of the Potters Bar rail crash in 2002 . 
 On 26 February , an interim report published by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation . The report contained a single conclusion , that the immediate cause of the accident was the condition of the stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover , which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades . The stretcher bars ( components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart ) had been found to be disconnected or missing . Of the three bars , one was not in position , another had nuts and bolts missing , and two were fractured . The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train . 
 Following the RAIB report , Network Rail released a statement in which its Chief Executive , John Armitt , described how the organisation was " devastated to conclude that the condition of the set of points at Grayrigg caused this terrible accident " . He apologised " to all the people affected by the failure of the infrastructure " . 
 The RAIB report noted that the Network Rail New Measurement Train ran over the site on 21 February . This train uses lasers and other instruments to make measurements of the track geometry and other features such as overhead line height and stagger , and the track gauge , twist and cant . It is not used to inspect points , but it does make a video record of the track which can be reviewed later . Commenting on the possibility that the train 's video might have been used to detect the points damage and thereby prevent the accident , a Network Rail spokesman said : 
 The [ inspection ] train runs at speeds of up to 125 mph , or 95 mph on this stretch . There would be no point somebody watching it at that speed as they wouldn 't be able to pick up any faults . It has to be run in super @-@ slow motion to spot faults . The train runs for up to 18 hours a day , seven days a week . It would probably take someone most of the month to watch one day 's worth of data . It 's not what it 's there for . It 's a backwards reference tool . 
 Network Rail admitted it failed to carry out a scheduled visual track inspection in the area on the Sunday before the derailment . 
 Bob Crow of the RMT union said : 
 This is shutting the stable door after the horse has well and truly bolted . We argued this train should not replace visual inspections . Inspectors who walk the track are the eyes and ears of the railway . They don 't just check the safety of the track , they look at the area surrounding it , check for signs of potential trouble such as gaps in the fence where vandals could get in . 
 Labour Party Member of Parliament John McDonnell added : " The fact that Network Rail apparently had footage of a missing stretcher bar days before the fatal crash is very worrying . " 
 As part of the investigation by the British Transport Police , three Network Rail employees were arrested and bailed , one in July 2007 and two in November 2007 All three were due to answer bail in March 2008 but this was extended until the end of June pending further inquiries . On 9 February 2009 , the British Transport Police confirmed that none of the three Network Rail employees arrested in connection with the derailment will be charged following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service . 
 = = Subsequent service disruption = = 
 Immediately after the accident , all services were suspended and the First ScotRail Sleeper train , the Caledonian Sleeper , was curtailed and passengers transferred to overnight coaches . 
 The line closure that followed the initial service suspension saw most Virgin services terminate at Preston or Lancaster from the south , with buses to Carlisle and all stations along the route . The only exception was an early @-@ morning and late @-@ evening through service from Carlisle to London and return . This was diesel @-@ hauled via Blackburn and Settle . There were also several non @-@ stop trains from Preston to London Euston . Local services all terminated short but many were able to make their journeys as their destinations were off branches . The Caledonian Sleeper was diverted via the East Coast Main Line , along with freight services , although some were diesel @-@ hauled via Blackburn and Settle .
