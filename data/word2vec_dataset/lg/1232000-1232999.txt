 Silent Hill 3 received positive reviews , garnering an 83 @.@ 77 % rating at Game Rankings for the PlayStation 2 version , and a 71 @.@ 15 % rating for the PC version . Its Metacritic rating for the PlayStation 2 version is 85 / 100 , while the PC version has a rating of 72 / 100 . The PC version fared less well , with some reviewers drawing unfavourable comparisons to other combat @-@ based games found on the PC platform , while others highlighted some technical issues , such as poor gamepad controller support . 
 Positive reactions were given to the general horror and atmosphere of the game , including " truly horrifying sections , " it " packs some genuine scares " and " the feeling of eeriness and doom is almost overwhelming . " The story told as part of the atmosphere was also received positively , making for a " satisfying , coherent sequel , " although its status as such meant that " it may be a little tough to follow for people who haven 't played the first game " , despite " a laudable effort to help people catch up . " In addition , the graphics , audio and production values were all credited with adding positively to the atmosphere . 
 Negative criticism largely stemmed from the lack of any innovations in gameplay ; the game " doesn 't do anything major that the series hasn 't done before " , " does little in term of innovation " and " doesn 't offer much beyond the other titles in the series . " Also criticised was the game 's camera and control system which , despite having been improved from previous games , was described as " awkward , disorienting , and motion sickness @-@ inducing . " Some criticism stemmed from the length of the game , as it " can be easily beaten in a handful of hours . " 
 Silent Hill 3 sold over 300 @,@ 000 copies by November 2003 . The game also topped sales charts in Japan upon its release .

 = Cloud ( video game ) = 
 Cloud is a 2005 indie puzzle video game developed by a team of students in the University of Southern California 's ( USC ) Interactive Media Program . The team began development of Cloud in January 2005 with a US $ 20 @,@ 000 grant from the USC ; the game was released as a free download that October . By July 2006 , the hosting website had received 6 million visits , and the game had been downloaded 600 @,@ 000 times . 
 The game centers on a boy who dreams of flying while asleep in a hospital bed . The concept was partially based on lead designer Jenova Chen 's childhood ; he was often hospitalized for asthma and would daydream while alone in his room . Assuming the role of the boy , the player flies through a dream world and manipulates clouds to solve puzzles . The game was intended to spark emotions in the player that the video game industry usually ignored . 
 Cloud won the Best Student Philosophy award at the 2006 Slamdance Guerilla Games Competition , and a Student Showcase award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival . The game was well received by critics , who cited its visuals , music , and relaxing atmosphere as high points . Chen and producer Kellee Santiago went on to co @-@ found the studio Thatgamecompany , which has considered remaking Cloud as a commercial video game . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Cloud , a single @-@ player video game for Microsoft Windows , centers on a boy who dreams of flying through the sky while asleep in a hospital bed . The player assumes control of the sleeping boy 's avatar — the projection of the boy into his dream world — and guides him through his dream of a small group of islands with a light gathering of clouds . The avatar 's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse ; movement is generally on a horizontal plane , but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third button of the mouse . The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally . 
 The game contains three types of clouds : white clouds , which follow the avatar ; gray , neutral clouds , which become white when touched ; and black clouds , which may be combined with white clouds to cause rain , dissolving both clouds . A large number of white clouds more easily dissolves a small number of dark clouds than an equal number , and vice versa . White clouds stop following the avatar if the player moves too quickly and they resume following if approached again . Each of the four missions in Cloud has a different objective , including forming patterns in the sky with clouds , eliminating black clouds , and creating rain over each of the islands .

 Cloud was designed and released in 2005 by a team of seven students in the Interactive Media master 's degree program at the USC School of Cinematic Arts . The game was not made for a specific class . Development began in January 2005 and the game was released in late October , receiving its final update in December . The group was headed by Jenova Chen and included Stephen <unk> , Erik Nelson , Aaron Meyers , Glenn Song , composer Vincent Diamante , and producer Kellee Santiago . The game won the 2005 Game Innovation Grant of $ 20 @,@ 000 from the USC , which is intended to support the production of experimental games . The idea for the game was partially based on Chen 's childhood experience , as he was often hospitalized for asthma and would daydream while waiting for the doctors . 
 According to Chen , Cloud was designed to " expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke . " Chen had the first idea for the game ; while walking to school one day he looked up at the sky , noticing the difference between the fluffy clouds there and the " polluted and gray " clouds of Shanghai where he was born , and thought about making a game about clouds . It was given a story to " create the premise and help player to be emotionally invested " ; however , the team avoided making the story too strong , as it would " distract the player from the core experience " of flying freely and shaping clouds . In the early stages of development , the game had an involved backstory about an alien who attempts to clean up the environment , but this was cut down to " a simple ' poetic ' introduction to the cloud child trapped in a hospital bed . " The team intended Cloud to " communicate a feeling of youthfulness , freedom , and the wonder of imagination . " It was built on a modified version of a game engine developed by several team members for their previous game , <unk> . At the 2006 Game Developers Conference student showcase , Chen and Santiago pitched Cloud to Sony representative John Hight as the first game in the " Zen " genre . Hight was interested , but Sony declined to publish the game .

 Cloud won the Best Student Philosophy award for artistic achievement at the Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition and a Student Showcase award at the Independent Games Festival . It was showcased on Spike TV , G4TV , and CBS Sunday . The game immediately received a great deal of attention when it was released ; site traffic overran the server they were hosting the website on , and then crashed those of the school . By February 2006 , just over three months after its release , the website had been viewed over one million times and the game downloaded over 300 @,@ 000 times . By July 2006 , it had reached six million visits and 600 @,@ 000 downloads . 
 The game received positive reviews from critics . Joel Durham , Jr. of GameSpy claimed that " everything about Cloud is simply jaw @-@ dropping " , and cited its music , visuals , and sensation of flying as high points . William Usher of Game Tunnel also praised the visuals and audio ; he believed that its graphics created a relaxing atmosphere , and that the " touching musical score " would emotionally move any player . A reviewer for Game Informer said that the game pointed " to a bright future " in which games would inspire a wider range of emotions ; however , the writer called Cloud more of an " experience " than a game . Ron White of PC World similarly called it " the most relaxing experience I 've ever had that involved a computer " . Durham concluded that Cloud " would set your mind free " . 
 Chen and Santiago went on to co @-@ found the video game studio Thatgamecompany . Composer Vincent Diamante and Erik Nelson worked for the company on its second game , Flower . Thatgamecompany has considered remaking Cloud as a commercial video game , but has decided to do so only if the staff cannot conceive any other game ideas . 
 = Nauru = 
 Nauru ( / <unk> / nah @-@ OO @-@ roo or / <unk> / <unk> @-@ oo ) , officially the Republic of Nauru ( Nauruan : <unk> <unk> ) and formerly known as Pleasant Island , is an island country in Micronesia in the Central Pacific . Its nearest neighbour is Banaba Island in Kiribati , 300 kilometres ( 186 mi ) to the east . It further lies northwest of Tuvalu , north of the Solomon islands , east @-@ northeast of PNG , southeast of the FSM and south of the Marshalls . With 9 @,@ 488 residents in a 21 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 8 @.@ 1 sq mi ) area , Nauru is the smallest state in the South Pacific and third smallest state by area in the world , behind only Vatican City and Monaco . 
 Settled by native peoples from Micronesia and Polynesia , Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century . After World War I , Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia , New Zealand and the United Kingdom . During World War II , Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops , who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific . After the war ended , the country entered into UN trusteeship . Nauru gained its independence in 1968 . 
 Nauru is a phosphate rock island with rich deposits near the surface , which allowed easy strip mining operations . It has some remaining phosphate resources which , as of 2011 , are not economically viable for extraction . Nauru boasted the highest per @-@ capita income enjoyed by any sovereign state in the world during the late 1960s and early 1970s . When the phosphate reserves were exhausted , and the island 's environment had been seriously harmed by mining , the trust that had been established to manage the island 's wealth diminished in value . To earn income , Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre . From 2001 to 2008 , and again from 2012 , it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru detention centre . As a result of heavy dependence on Australia , many sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia . 
 The president of Nauru is Baron <unk> , who heads a 19 @-@ member unicameral parliament . The country is a member of the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations , the Asian Development Bank and the Pacific Islands Forum . Nauru also participates in the Commonwealth and Olympic Games . Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency ( <unk> ) .The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the International Monetary Fund in April 2016 . 
 = = History = = 
 Nauru was first inhabited by Micronesians and Polynesians at least 3 @,@ 000 years ago . There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru , which are represented in the 12 @-@ pointed star on the country 's flag . Traditionally , Nauruans traced their descent matrilineally . Inhabitants practised aquaculture : they caught juvenile <unk> fish , acclimatised them to fresh water , and raised them in the <unk> Lagoon , providing a reliable source of food . The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus fruit . The name " Nauru " may derive from the Nauruan word <unk> , which means " I go to the beach " . 
 The British sea captain John Fearn , a whale hunter , became the first Westerner to visit Nauru in 1798 , calling it " Pleasant Island " . From around 1830 , Nauruans had contact with Europeans from whaling ships and traders who replenished their supplies ( particularly fresh water ) at Nauru . 
 Around this time , deserters from European ships began to live on the island . The islanders traded food for alcoholic palm wine and firearms . The firearms were used during the 10 @-@ year Nauruan Tribal War that began in 1878 . 
 Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany 's Marshall Islands Protectorate for administrative purposes . The arrival of the Germans ended the civil war , and kings were established as rulers of the island . The most widely known of these was King <unk> . Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888 . The German settlers called the island <unk> or <unk> . The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades . Robert Rasch , a German trader who married a Nauruan woman , was the first administrator , appointed in 1890 . 
 Phosphate was discovered on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector Albert Fuller Ellis . The Pacific Phosphate Company began to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany , exporting its first shipment in 1907 . In 1914 , following the outbreak of World War I , Nauru was captured by Australian troops . In 1919 it was agreed by the Allied and Associated Powers that His <unk> Majesty should be the administering authority under a League of Nations mandate . The Nauru Island Agreement made in 1919 between the governments of the United Kingdom , Australia and New Zealand provided for the administration of the island and for working of the phosphate deposits by an inter @-@ governmental British Phosphate Commission ( BPC ) . The terms of the League of Nations Mandate were drawn up in 1920 . 
 The island experienced an influenza epidemic in 1920 , with a mortality rate of 18 per cent among native Nauruans . 
 In 1923 , the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru , with the United Kingdom and New Zealand as co @-@ trustees . On 6 and 7 December 1940 , the German auxiliary cruisers Komet and Orion sank five supply ships in the vicinity of Nauru . Komet then shelled Nauru 's phosphate mining areas , oil storage depots , and the <unk> cantilever . 
 Japanese troops occupied Nauru on 25 August 1942 . The Japanese built an airfield which was bombed for the first time on 25 March 1943 , preventing food supplies from being flown to Nauru . The Japanese deported 1 @,@ 200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the Chuuk islands . Nauru , which had been bypassed and left to " wither on the vine " by American forces , was finally liberated on 13 September 1945 , when commander <unk> Soeda surrendered the island to the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy . 
 This surrender was accepted by Brigadier J. R. Stevenson , who represented Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee , the commander of the First Australian Army , on board the warship HMAS Diamantina . Arrangements were made to repatriate from Chuuk the 737 Nauruans who survived Japanese captivity there . They were returned to Nauru by the BPC ship Trienza in January 1946 . 
 In 1947 , a trusteeship was established by the United Nations , with Australia , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom as trustees . In 1947 , a United Nations trusteeship agreement between the three countries was approved by the United Nations . Under those arrangements , the UK , Australia and New Zealand were a joint administering authority . The Nauru Island Agreement provided for the first Administrator to be appointed by Australia for 5 years , leaving subsequent appointments to be decided by the three governments . However , in practice , administrative power was exercised by Australia alone . 
 Nauru became self @-@ governing in January 1966 , and following a two @-@ year constitutional convention it became independent in 1968 under founding president Hammer <unk> . In 1967 , the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners , and in June 1970 control passed to the locally owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation . Income from the mines gave Nauruans one of the highest standards of living in the Pacific . In 1989 , Nauru took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia 's administration of the island , in particular Australia 's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining . Certain Phosphate Lands : Nauru v. Australia led to an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement to rehabilitate the mined @-@ out areas of Nauru . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Nauru is a 21 square kilometres ( 8 sq mi ) oval @-@ shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean , located 42 kilometres ( 26 mi ) south of the Equator . The island is surrounded by a coral reef , which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles . The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a seaport , although channels in the reef allow small boats access to the island . A fertile coastal strip 150 to 300 metres ( 490 to 980 ft ) wide lies inland from the beach . 
 Coral cliffs surround Nauru 's central plateau . The highest point of the plateau , called the Command Ridge , is 71 metres ( 233 ft ) above sea level . 
 The only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt , where coconut palms flourish . The land surrounding <unk> Lagoon supports bananas , pineapples , vegetables , pandanus trees and indigenous hardwoods such as the <unk> tree . 
 Nauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean , along with Banaba ( Ocean Island ) in Kiribati and <unk> in French Polynesia . The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted . Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 metres ( 49 ft ) high . Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 percent of Nauru 's land area , and has also affected the surrounding Exclusive Economic Zone ; 40 percent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff . 
 There are limited natural fresh water resources on Nauru . Rooftop storage tanks collect rainwater . The islanders are mostly dependent on three desalination plants housed at Nauru 's Utilities Agency . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Nauru 's climate is hot and very humid year @-@ round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean . Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February , but does not typically experience cyclones . Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the El Niño @-@ Southern Oscillation , with several significant recorded droughts . The temperature on Nauru ranges between 26 and 35 ° C ( 79 and 95 ° F ) during the day and between 22 and 34 ° C ( 72 and 93 ° F ) at night . 
 = = = Ecology = = = 
 Fauna is sparse on the island due to a combination of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphates mining . Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat . There are about 60 recorded vascular plant species native to the island , none of which are endemic . Coconut farming , mining , and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation . 
 There are no native land mammals , but there are native insects , land crabs , and birds , including the endemic Nauru reed warbler . The Polynesian rat , cats , dogs , pigs , and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships . The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island , as well as SCUBA diving and snorkelling . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Nauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government . The president is both head of state and head of government . A 19 @-@ member unicameral parliament is elected every three years . The parliament elects the president from its members , and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members . 
 Nauru does not have any formal structure for political parties , and candidates typically stand for office as independents ; fifteen of the 19 members of the current Parliament are independents . Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party , the Democratic Party , Nauru First , and the Centre Party . However , alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than party affiliation . 
 From 1992 to 1999 , Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council ( NIC ) . This nine @-@ member council was designed to provide municipal services . The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government . Land tenure on Nauru is unusual : all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island , which is owned by individuals and family groups . Government and corporate entities do not own any land , and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land . Non @-@ Nauruans cannot own land on the island . 
 Nauru had 17 changes of administration between 1989 and 2003 . Bernard <unk> died in office in March 2003 and Ludwig Scotty was elected as the president , later being re @-@ elected to serve a full term in October 2004 . Following a vote of no confidence on 19 December 2007 , Scotty was replaced by Marcus Stephen . Stephen resigned in November 2011 , and Freddie Pitcher became President . <unk> <unk> then filed a motion of no confidence in Pitcher , resulting in him becoming president . Following parliamentary elections in 2013 , Baron <unk> was elected president . 
 Its Supreme Court , headed by the Chief Justice , is paramount on constitutional issues . Other cases can be appealed to the two @-@ judge Appellate Court . Parliament cannot overturn court decisions , but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the High Court of Australia . In practice this rarely happens . Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court , both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate , who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court . There are two other quasi @-@ courts : the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board , both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice . 
 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 Following independence in 1968 , Nauru joined the Commonwealth of Nations as a Special Member ; it became a full member in 2000 . The country was admitted to the Asian Development Bank in 1991 and to the United Nations in 1999 . Nauru is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum , the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme , the South Pacific Commission , and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission . The American Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program operates a climate @-@ monitoring facility on the island . 
 Nauru has no armed forces , though there is a small police force under civilian control . Australia is responsible for Nauru 's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries . The September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance , including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget , and advisers on health and education . This aid is in return for Nauru 's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed . Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency . 
 Nauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both Taiwan ( ROC ) and China ( PRC ) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the One @-@ China policy . On 21 July 2002 , Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC , accepting $ 130 million from the PRC for this action . In response , the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later . Nauru later re @-@ established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005 , and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005 . However , the PRC continues to maintain a representative office on Nauru . 
 In 2008 , Nauru recognised Kosovo as an independent country , and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country , after Russia , Nicaragua , and Venezuela , to recognise Abkhazia , a breakaway region of Georgia . Russia was reported to be giving Nauru $ 50 million in humanitarian aid as a result of this recognition . On 15 July 2008 , the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme , financed with US $ 9 million of development aid received from Russia . The Nauru government claims this aid is not related to its recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
 A significant portion of Nauru 's income has been in the form of aid from Australia . In 2001 , the MV Tampa , a Norwegian ship that had rescued 438 refugees from a stranded 20 @-@ metre @-@ long boat , was seeking to dock in Australia . In what became known as the Tampa affair , the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops . The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS Manoora and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government 's Pacific Solution . Nauru operated two detention centres known as State House and Topside for these refugees in exchange for Australian aid . By November 2005 , only two refugees , Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal , remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001 , with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007 . The Australian government sent further groups of asylum @-@ seekers to Nauru in late 2006 and early 2007 . The refugee centre was closed in 2008 , but , following the Australian government 's re @-@ adoption of the Pacific Solution in August 2012 , it has re @-@ opened it .

The following table shows population size by district as per 2011 census . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The Nauruan economy peaked in the early 1980s , as it was dependent almost entirely on the phosphate deposits that originate from the droppings of sea birds . There are few other resources , and most necessities are imported . Small @-@ scale mining is still conducted by <unk> , formerly known as the Nauru Phosphate Corporation . The government places a percentage of <unk> 's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust . The Trust manages long @-@ term investments , which were intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves were exhausted . 
 Because of mismanagement , the Trust 's fixed and current assets were reduced considerably and may never fully recover . The failed investments included financing Leonardo the Musical in 1993 . The Mercure Hotel in Sydney and Nauru House in Melbourne were sold in 2004 to finance debts and Air Nauru 's only Boeing 737 was repossessed in December 2005 . Normal air service resumed after the aircraft was replaced with a Boeing 737 – 300 airliner in June 2006 . In 2005 , the corporation sold its property asset in Melbourne , the vacant Savoy Tavern site , for $ 7 @.@ 5 million . 
 The value of the Trust is estimated to have shrunk from A $ 1 @.@ 3 billion in 1991 to $ 138 million in 2002 . Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government ; for example , the National Bank of Nauru is insolvent . The CIA World Factbook estimated a GDP per capita of $ 5 @,@ 000 in 2005 . The Asian Development Bank 2007 economic report on Nauru estimated GDP per capita at $ 2 @,@ 400 to $ 2 @,@ 715 . The United Nations ( 2013 ) estimates the GDP per capita to 15 @,@ 211 and ranks it 51 on its GDP per capita country list . 
 There are no personal taxes in Nauru . The unemployment rate is estimated to be 90 percent , and of those who have jobs , the government employs 95 percent . The Asian Development Bank notes that although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms , in the absence of an alternative to phosphate mining , the medium @-@ term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance . Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy . 
 In the 1990s , Nauru became a tax haven and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee . The inter @-@ governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ( FATF ) identified Nauru as one of 15 " non @-@ cooperative " countries in its fight against money laundering . During the 1990s , it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only $ 25 @,@ 000 with no other requirements . Under pressure from FATF , Nauru introduced anti @-@ avoidance legislation in 2003 , after which foreign hot money left the country . In October 2005 , after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement , FATF lifted the non @-@ cooperative designation . 
 From 2001 to 2007 , the Nauru detention centre provided a significant source of income for the country . The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia . In February 2008 , the Foreign Affairs minister , Dr Kieren Keke , stated that the closure would result in 100 Nauruans losing their jobs , and would affect 10 percent of the island 's population directly or indirectly : " We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income . We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited . Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us .

 = Vithoba = 
 Vithoba , also known as Vi ( t ) <unk> ( a ) and Panduranga , is a Hindu god predominantly worshipped in the Indian states of Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Telangana and Andhra Pradesh . He is generally considered a manifestation of the god Vishnu or his avatar , Krishna . Vithoba is often depicted as a dark young boy , standing arms akimbo on a brick , sometimes accompanied by his main consort Rakhumai . 
 Vithoba is the focus of the monotheistic , non @-@ <unk> Varkari religion of Maharashtra and the Haridasa faith of Karnataka . Vitthal Temple , Pandharpur is his main temple . Vithoba legends revolve around his devotee Pundalik , who is credited with bringing the deity to Pandharpur , and around <unk> 's role as a saviour to the poet @-@ saints of the Varkari faith . The Varkari poet @-@ saints are known for their unique genre of devotional lyric , the <unk> , dedicated to Vithoba and composed in Marathi . Other devotional literature dedicated to Vithoba includes the Kannada hymns of the Haridasa and Marathi versions of the generic aarti songs associated with rituals of offering light to the deity . The most important festivals of Vithoba are held on Shayani Ekadashi in the month of Ashadha , and Prabodhini Ekadashi in the month of Kartik . 
 The historiography of Vithoba and his cult is an area of continuing debate , even regarding his name . Various Indologists have proposed a prehistory for Vithoba worship where he was previously : a hero stone , a pastoral deity , a manifestation of Shiva , a Jain saint , or even all of these at various times for various devotees . Though the origins of both his cult and his main temple are likewise debated , there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century . 
 = = Etymology and other names = = 
 Vithoba ( Marathi : <unk> , Viṭhobā ) is known by many names , including : Vitthala , Panduranga , <unk> , Hari and Narayan . 
 There are several theories about the origins and meanings of these names . Varkari tradition suggests that the name Vitthala ( also spelled as Vitthal , <unk> , Vittala and <unk> ; Marathi : <unk> ् <unk> , <unk> ; Kannada : <unk> ್ <unk> and Telugu : <unk> ్ <unk> ; <unk> ) is composed of two Sanskrit @-@ Marathi words : <unk> , which means ' brick ' ; and <unk> , which may have originated from the Sanskrit <unk> , meaning ' standing ' . Thus , Vitthala would mean ' one standing on a brick ' . William Crooke , orientalist , supported this explanation . The prescribed iconography of Vithoba stipulates that he be shown standing arms @-@ akimbo upon a brick , which is associated with the legend of the devotee Pundalik . 
 However , the Varkari poet @-@ saint Tukaram proposed a different etymology — that Vitthala is composed of the words <unk> ( ignorance ) and la ( one who accepts ) , thus meaning ' one who accepts innocent people who are devoid of knowledge ' . Historian Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar offers yet another possibility — that <unk> ( <unk> ) is a Kannada corruption of the name Vishnu adopted in Marathi . The suffixes <unk> and <unk> ( meaning ' father ' in Marathi ) were appended for reverence , producing the names Vitthala and Vithoba . This corruption of Vishnu to <unk> could have been due to the tendency of Marathi and Kannada people to pronounce the Sanskrit <unk> ( / <unk> / ) as <unk> ( / <unk> / ) , attested since the 8th century . 
 According to research scholar M. S. Mate of the Deccan College , Pundalik — who is assumed to be a historical figure — was instrumental in persuading the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana alias <unk> to build the Pandharpur temple dedicated to Vishnu . The deity was subsequently named as Vitthala , a derivative of <unk> , by the builder @-@ king . Other variants of the name include <unk> ( King Vitthala ) , and <unk> ( Mother Vitthala ) . The people of Gujarat add the suffix <unk> ( Lord ) to Vitthala , which yields the name Vitthal @-@ <unk> . The additional honorific suffix <unk> may be added , giving the name <unk> . This name is generally used in the Pushtimarg sect . 
 Panduranga ( Marathi : <unk> , Kannada : <unk> , Telugu : <unk> ; all <unk> ) , also spelt as <unk> and <unk> , is another popular epithet for Vithoba , which means ' the white god ' in Sanskrit . The Jain author @-@ saint Hemachandra ( 1089 – 1172 AD ) notes it is also used as an epithet for the god Rudra @-@ Shiva . Even though Vithoba is depicted with dark complexion , he is called a " white god " . Bhandarkar explains this paradox , proposing that Panduranga may be an epithet for the form of Shiva worshipped in Pandharpur , and whose temple still stands . Later , with the increasing popularity of Vithoba 's cult , this was also transferred to Vithoba . Another theory suggests that Vithoba may initially have been a Shaiva god ( related to Shiva ) , only later identified with Vishnu , thus explaining the usage of Panduranga for Vithoba . Crooke , however , proposed that Panduranga is a Sanskritised form of <unk> ( belonging to <unk> ) , referring to the old name of Pandharpur . Another name , <unk> , also refers to Vithoba as the lord of <unk> ( yet another variant for Pandharpur ) . 
 Finally , Vithoba is also addressed by the names of Lord Vishnu like Hari and Narayana , in the Vaishnav religions . 
 = = Origins and development = = 
 Reconstruction of the historical development of Vithoba worship has been much debated . In particular , several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages , as well as the point at which he came to be recognised as a distinct deity . The <unk> stotra , a hymn attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century , indicates that Vithoba worship might have already existed at an early date . 
 According to Richard Maxwell Eaton , author of A Social History of the Deccan , Vithoba was first worshipped as a pastoral god as early as the 6th century . Vithoba 's arms @-@ akimbo iconography is similar to Bir <unk> , the cattle @-@ god of the <unk> of Bihar , who is now also associated with Krishna . Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon and identified with the god Shiva , like most other pastoral gods . This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples ( most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself ) , and that Vithoba is crowned with the Linga , symbol of Shiva . However , since the 13th century , the poet @-@ saints like Namdev , Eknath and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu . 
 Christian Lee <unk> of the University of Washington suggests that Vithoba 's worship migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur some time before 1000 CE ; but under the possible influence of a Krishna @-@ worshipping <unk> sect , the town was transformed into a Vaishnava center of pilgrimage . This proposal is consistent with contemporary remnants of Shaiva worship in the town . 
 The religious historian R.C. Dhere , winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Sri Vitthal : Ek <unk> , opines that Vithoba worship may be even older — " Vedic or pre @-@ Vedic " , hence pre @-@ dating the worship of Krishna . According to this theory , Vithoba is an amalgam of various local heroes , who gave their lives to save their cattle . He was first worshipped by the Dhangar , the cattle @-@ owning caste of Maharashtra . The rise of the Yadava dynasty , which had cowherd ancestry , could have led to the glorification of Vithoba as Krishna , who is often depicted as a cowherd . This <unk> of Vithoba also led to conversion of the Shaiva Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik , who — according to legend — brought Vithoba to Pandharpur . There may have been an attempt to assimilate Vithoba into Buddhism ; today , both are viewed as a form of Vishnu in Hinduism . 
 Despite assimilation in Vaishnavism as Krishna @-@ Vishnu , Vithoba does not inherit the erotic overtones of Krishna , such as his dalliance with the gopis ( milkmaids ) . Vithoba is associated more with " compassion , an infinite love and tenderness for his bhaktas ( devotees ) that can be compared to the love of the mother for her children .. pining for the presence of his devotees the way a cow pines for her far @-@ away calf . " 
 G. A. Deleury , author of The cult of Vithoba , proposes that the image of Vithoba is a <unk> ( hero stone ) , which was later identified with Vishnu in his form as Krishna , and that Pundalik transformed the Puranic , ritualistic puja worship into more idealised bhakti worship — " <unk> adoration <unk> caste distinction and institutional priesthood .. " Indologist Dr. Tilak suggests that Vithoba emerged as " an alternative to the existing pantheon " of brahminical deities ( related to classical , ritualistic Hinduism ) . The emergence of Vithoba was concurrent with the rise of a " new type of lay devotee " , the Varkari . While Vishnu and Shiva were bound in rigid ritualistic worship and Brahmin ( priestly ) control , Vithoba , " the God of the subaltern , became increasingly human . " Vithoba is often praised as the protector of the poor and needy . Stevenson ( 1843 ) suggests that Vithoba could have been a Jain saint , as the Vithoba images were similar to Jain images . 
 = = = Pandharpur temple and inscriptions = = = 
 Scholastic investigation of Vithoba 's history often begins with consideration of the dating of the chief temple at Pandharpur , which is believed to be the earliest Vithoba temple . The oldest part of the temple dates to the Yadava period of the 12th and 13th centuries . Most of the temple is believed to have been built in the 17th century , though addition to the temple has never ceased . The date the temple was first established is unclear to Bhandarkar , but he insists there is clear evidence to suggest it existed by the 13th century . According to S. G. <unk> , the temple stood as early as 1189 . In fact , a monument dated 1189 records establishment of a small Vithoba shrine at the present location of the temple ; thus , <unk> concludes , the worship of Vithoba predates 1189 . 
 A stone inscription dated 1237 , found on an overhead beam of the present Vithoba temple , mentions that the Hoysala king Someshvara donated a village for the expense of the bhoga ( food offering ) for " Vitthala " . An inscription on a copper plate , dated 1249 , records the Yadava king Krishna granting to one of his generals the village <unk> ( kshetra of <unk> ) , on the river <unk> , in the presence of the god Vishnu . Another stone inscription in Pandharpur narrates a sacrifice at <unk> due to which " people and Vitthal along with the gods were gratified " . Thus from the 13th century , the city is known as the city of Panduranga . Inside the temple , a stone inscription records gifts to the temple between 1272 and 1277 from various donors , notably the Yadava king Ramachandra 's minister <unk> . 
 Ranade believes that an inscription , found in <unk> and referring to Vitthala and Rakhumai , is the oldest related to Vithoba , and dates it to 1209 . However , the name <unk> is found on a Rashtrakuta copper plate inscription , dated 516 . Citing this , Pande infers that Vithoba 's cult was well established by the 6th century . 
 = = = Central image = = = 
 The physical characteristics of the central murti ( image ) of Vithoba at Pandharpur , and various textual references to it , have inspired theories relating to Vithoba worship . Sand concludes , from a version of Pundalik 's legend in the Skanda Purana ( see Legend below ) , that two distinct murtis must have existed at Pandharpur — one each of tirtha and kshetra type . The earlier one was a tirtha murti , an image purposely sited near a holy body of water ( tirtha ) , in this case facing west , on the Bhima riverbed , near the Pundalik shrine . The later murti , according to Sand , was a kshetra murti , located at a place of holy power ( kshetra ) , in this case facing east , on the hill where the current temple has stood since about 1189 . Thus , Sand proposes that the worship of Vithoba may predate the temple itself . 
 Deleury suggests that although the temple may have been built in the 13th century , given the <unk> style architecture , the statue of Vithoba is of an earlier style so may have been carved for an earlier , smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur . The workmanship of the image is earlier than the style of the Yadava ( 1175 – 1318 ) , the <unk> Chalukya ( 943 – 1210 ) and even the Ajmer <unk> ( 685 – 1193 ) eras . Although no other existing Vishnu temple has iconography like Pandharpur 's Vithoba , Deleury finds similarities between the Pandharpur image and the third @-@ century , arms @-@ akimbo Vishnu images at <unk> Caves , Madhya Pradesh but declares that they are from different schools of sculpture . 
 = = = Pundalik = = = 
 The devotee Pundalik , thrower of the brick ( see Legend below ) , is a major character in the legends of Vithoba . He is commonly perceived to be a historical figure , connected with the establishment and propagation of the Vithoba @-@ centric Varkari sect . Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar considers Pundalik to be the founder of the Varkari sect and the one who promulgated the sect in Maratha country . Stevenson ( 1843 ) goes further , suggesting he might have been a Jain or a Buddhist , since Varkari tradition is a combination of Jain and Buddhist morals , and Vithoba is viewed as Vishnu in his form as Buddha . Frazer , Edwards and P.R. Bhandarkar ( 1922 ) all suggest that Pundalik tried to unify Shiva and Vishnu , and that this sect originated in Karnataka . Ranade ( 1933 ) thinks that Pundalik , a Kannada saint , was not only the founder of the Varkari sect but also the first great devotee or first high priest of the Pandharpur temple . Upadhyaya supports the priest theory but declines the Kannada origin theory . According to M. S. Mate , Pundalik was instrumental in coaxing the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana to build the Pandharpur temple to Vishnu , placing him in the early 12th century . Other scholars like Raeside ( 1965 ) , <unk> ( 1972 ) , and Vaudeville ( 1974 ) have questioned the historicity of Pundalik altogether , and dismissed him as a mythical figure . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Primarily , there are three Hindu deities associated with Vithoba : Vishnu , Krishna and Shiva . Gautama Buddha is also associated with Vithoba , consistent with Hindu deification of the Buddha as the ninth incarnation of Vishnu . However , Varkari consider Vithoba to be the <unk> ( original ) Vishnu himself , not an Avatar ( manifestation ) of Vishnu like Krishna , despite legends and consorts linking Vithoba to Krishna . However , even the <unk> , who rose in the 13th century as a Krishna @-@ worshipping sect , not only dismissed the notion that Vithoba is Krishna but also frequently vilified Vithoba . 
 In some traditions though , Vithoba is also worshipped as a form of Shiva . The Dhangars still consider Vithoba to be a brother of the god <unk> , and view Vithoba as a Shaiva god rather than a Vaishnava one . Underhill proposes that the shrine of Pandharpur is a combined form of Vishnu @-@ Shiva established by the Bhagavata sect that worships Vishnu @-@ Shiva — the Lord , which is what bhagavata means . However , for the chief priests of the Pandharpur temple — Brahmins of the <unk> family — " Viṭhobā is neither <unk> nor Śiva . Viṭhobā is Viṭhobā " ( IAST original ) . Despite this , some priests of the temple point to marks on the Vithoba image 's chest as proof of Vithoba being Vishnu , in his form as Krishna . 
 Vithoba 's image replaces the traditional representation of Buddha , when depicted as the ninth avatar of Vishnu , in some temple sculptures and Hindu astrological almanacs in Maharashtra . In the 17th century , Maratha artists sculpted an image of Pandharpur 's Vithoba in the Buddha 's place on a panel showing Vishnu 's avatars . This can be found in the <unk> Caves . Stevenson goes so far as to call devotees of Vithoba ( <unk> @-@ bhaktas ) Buddhist Vaishnavas ( <unk> @-@ Vaishnavas ) , since they consider Vithoba to be the ninth — namely Buddha — avatar of Vishnu . Some of the poet @-@ saints praised Vithoba as a form of Buddha . B. R. Ambedkar , an Indian political leader and Buddhist convert , suggested that the image of Vithoba at Pandharpur was in reality the image of the Buddha . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 All Vithoba images are generally modelled on his central image in Pandharpur . The Pandharpur image is a black basalt sculpture that is 3 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 14 m ) tall . Vithoba is depicted as dark young boy . The poet @-@ saints have called him " Para @-@ brahman with a dark complexion " . He wears high , conical headgear or a crown , interpreted as Shiva 's symbol — the Linga . Thus , according to Zelliot , Vithoba represents Shiva as well as Vishnu . The first Varkari poet @-@ saint , Dnyaneshwar ( 13th century ) , states that Vithoba ( Vishnu ) carries Shiva , who according to Vaishnavism is Vishnu 's first and foremost devotee , on his own head . 
 Vithoba is shown standing arms @-@ akimbo on the brick thrown by the devotee Pundalik . He wears a necklace of <unk> @-@ beads , embedded with the legendary <unk> gem , and makara @-@ kundala ( fish @-@ shaped earrings ) that the poet @-@ saint Tukaram relates to the iconography of Vishnu . Pandharpur 's Vithoba holds a shankha ( conch ) in his left hand and a chakra ( discus ) or lotus flower in his right , all of which are symbols traditionally associated with Vishnu . Some images depict Vithoba 's right hand making a gesture that has been traditionally misunderstood as a blessing ; no gesture of blessing is present in the Pandharpur image . Though usually depicted two @-@ armed , four @-@ armed representations of the deity also exist . 
 The Pandharpur image , when not clothed by its attendant priest to receive devotees , provides Vithoba with the detailed features distinctive of a male body , visible in full relief . However , close inspection of the stonework reveals the outline of a loincloth , supported by a <unk> ( waist belt ) , traced by thin , light carvings . Other images and pictures depict Vithoba clothed , usually with <unk> – a yellow dhoti and various gold ornaments — the manner in which he is attired by the priests in the daily rites . 
 The Pandharpur image also bears , on the left breast , the mark known as the <unk> — said to be a curl of white hair , usually found on the breast of Vishnu and Krishna images . The image is also dignified with a ring @-@ shaped mark called <unk> on the right breast , <unk> ( a three @-@ stringed waist @-@ belt ) , a long stick ( <unk> ) embedded in the ground between the legs , and double ring and pearl bracelets on the elbows . 
 = = Consorts = = 
 Vithoba is usually depicted with his main consort , Rakhumai , on his left side . Rakhumai ( or <unk> ) literally means ' mother Rukmini ' . Rukmini is traditionally viewed as the wife of Krishna . Hindus generally consider Krishna to be a form of Vishnu , hence his consort as a form of Lakshmi . Rakhumai is depicted in the arms @-@ akimbo posture , standing on a brick . She has an independent cella in the Pandharpur temple complex . According to <unk> , Rukmini — a princess of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra — was elevated to the status of the main consort instead of Radha , because of her affiliation with the region . According to Dhangar tradition , <unk> is worshipped by the community as Padmavati or <unk> , a protector of the community and cattle in particular . Dhangar folklore explains the reason behind separate shrines for Vithoba and <unk> as the outcome of Vithoba invoking a curse on his consort , and his non @-@ attachment to samsara ( the householder 's life ) . Apart from Rakhumai , two other consorts Satyabhama and Rahi ( derived from Radha ) are worshipped too . All three consorts are regarded as Krishna 's in Hindu mythology . 
 = = Worship = = 
 Vithoba is a popular deity in Maharashtra and Karnataka ; devotees also exist in Telangana , Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu , Kerala and Gujarat , but not in the same numbers . Vithoba is worshipped and revered by most Marathis , but he is not popular as a <unk> ( family deity ) . The main temple of Vithoba , which includes a distinct , additional shrine for his consort Rakhumai , is located at Pandharpur . In this context , Pandharpur is affectionately called " <unk> @-@ Vaikuntha " ( the place of residence of Vishnu on earth ) by devotees . Devotees from across Maharashtra , Karnataka and Telangana , visit Vithoba 's central temple at Pandharpur , since the times of Dnyaneshwar ( 13th century ) . 
 Two distinct traditions revolve around the worship of Vithoba in Maharashtra : ritual worship inside the temple by the Brahmin priests of the <unk> family ; and spiritual worship by the Varkaris . The ritual worship includes five daily rites . First , at about 3 am , is an arati to awaken the god , called <unk> . Next comes the <unk> , a puja that includes a bath with five ( pancha ) sweet substances called <unk> . The image is then dressed to receive morning devotions . The third rite is another puja involving re @-@ dressing and lunch at noon . This is known as <unk> . Afternoon devotions are followed by a fourth rite for dinner at sunset — the <unk> . The final rite is <unk> , an arati for putting the god to sleep . In addition to the rites at the main temple in Pandharpur , Haridasa traditions dedicated to Vitthala flourish in Karnataka . 
 = = = Varkari sect = = = 
 The Varkari <unk> ( Pilgrim Path ) or Varkari Sampradaya ( Pilgrim Tradition ) is one of the most important Vaishnava sects in India . It is a monotheistic , bhakti sect , focused on the worship of Vithoba and based on traditional Bhagavata dharma . The sect is a " Shaiva @-@ Vaishnava synthesis " and " nominal Vaishnavism , containing a free mix of other religions " . It is believed to have originated in Karnataka and migrated to Maharashtra . This last theory is based on a reference to Vithoba as " Kannada " ( belonging to Karnataka ) in the work of the first of the poet @-@ saints , Dnyaneshwar . However , this word can also be interpreted as " difficult to understand " . Varkaris and scholars who believe Pundalik to have been a historical figure also consider him to be founder of the cult of Vithoba . This is evidenced by the liturgical call — <unk> Hari Vitthala ! — which means " O Hari Vitthala ( Vithoba ) , who has given a boon to Pundalik ! " However , according to Zelliot , the sect was founded by Dnyaneshwar ( also spelled <unk> ) , who was a Brahmin poet and philosopher and flourished during the period 1275 – 1296 . Varkaris also give him credit with the saying — <unk> <unk> <unk> — which means " Dnyaneshwar laid the foundation stone " . 
 Namdev ( c . 1270 – 1350 ) , a Shudra tailor , wrote short Marathi devotional poems in praise of Vithoba called abhangas ( literally ' unbroken ' ) , and used the call @-@ and @-@ response kirtan ( literally ' repeating ' ) form of singing to praise the glory of his Lord . Public performance of this musical devotion led to the spread of the Vithoba faith , which accepted women , Shudras and outcaste " untouchables " , something forbidden in classical brahminical Hinduism . In the times of Muslim rulers , the faith faced stagnation . However , after the decline of the Vijayanagara empire , when wars erupted in the Deccan region , the Muslim rulers had to accept the faiths of Maharashtra in order to gather the support of its people . In this period , Eknath ( c . 1533 – 99 ) revived the Varkari tradition . With the foundation of the Maratha empire under Shivaji , Tukaram ( c . 1568 – 1650 ) , a Shudra grocer , further propagated the Vithoba @-@ centric tradition throughout the Maharashtra region . 
 All these poet @-@ saints , and others like Janabai , the maidservant of Namdev , wrote poetry dedicated to Vithoba . This Marathi poetry advocates pure devotion , referring to Vithoba mostly as a father , or in the case of the female saint Janabai 's poetry , as a mother ( <unk> ) . Not only women , like Janabai , but also a wide variety of people from different castes and backgrounds wrote abhangas in praise of Vithoba : <unk> <unk> ( who was an orthodox Shaiva and teacher of Namdev ) , Sena the barber , <unk> the goldsmith , <unk> the gardener , Gora the potter , Kanhopatra the dancing girl , Chokhamela the " untouchable " Mahar , and even the Muslim Sheikh Muhammad ( 1560 – 1650 ) . Anyone born Shaiva or Vaishnava who considers Vithoba his maya @-@ <unk> ( mother @-@ father ) and Pandharpur his <unk> ( maternal house of a bride ) is accepted as a Varkari by the sect irrespective of the barriers of caste . Varkaris often practice Vithoba japa ( meditative repetition of a divine name ) , and observe a fast on the <unk> of each month . 
 = = = Haridasa sect = = = 
 Haridasa means servant ( dasa ) of Vishnu ( Hari ) . According to Haridasa tradition , their sampradaya , also known as Haridasa @-@ kuta , was founded by Achalananda Vitthala ( c . 888 ) . It is a distinct branch within Vaishnavism , centered on Vitthala ( the Haridasa – Kannada name for Vithoba ) . Where Varkari are normally associated with Maharashtra , Haridasa are normally associated with Karnataka . The scholar Sharma considers Vithoba worship first emerged in Karnataka , only later moving to Maharashtra . He argues this on the basis of the reference by Dnyaneshwar , mentioned in section " Varkari sect " above . Lutgendorf credits the movement to Vyasatirtha ( 1478 – 1539 ) , the royal guru ( <unk> ) to king Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara empire . Vitthala enjoyed royal patronage in this era . Krishnadevaraya is also credited with building Vitthala 's temple at the then capital city Vijayanagara ( modern Hampi ) . 
 Haridasas consider the temple of Pandharpur to be sacred , as well that of Hampi , and worship Vitthala along with forms of Krishna . Haridasa literature generally deals with praise dedicated to Vitthala and Krishna . Haridasa poets like Vijaya Vitthala , Gopala Vitthala , Jagannatha Vitthala , Venugopala Vitthala and Mohana Vitthala assumed pen @-@ names ending with " Vitthala " , as an act of devotion . The Haridasa poet Purandara Dasa or Purandara Vitthala ( 1484 – 1564 ) , " father of Carnatic music " , often ended his Kannada language compositions with a salutation to Vitthala .

 The founder of the Hindu sect Pushtimarg – Vallabhacharya ( 1479 – 1531 ) is believed to have visited Pandharpur at least twice and was ordered to marry by Vithoba ( called Vitthalnath or <unk> in the sect ) and have children so that he could be born as Vallabhacharya 's son . Later , Vallabhacharya married . His second son and successor was recognized as a manifestation of Vithoba and named Vitthalnath , also known as <unk> . 
 = = = Festivals = = = 
 The festivals associated with Vithoba primarily correspond to the bi @-@ annual <unk> ( pilgrimages ) of the Varkaris . The pilgrims travel to the Pandharpur temple from <unk> and <unk> , towns closely associated with poet @-@ saints Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram respectively . Along the way , they sing abhangas ( devotional songs ) dedicated to Vithoba and repeat his name , carrying the <unk> ( palanquins ) of the poet @-@ saints . Varkaris do not engage in ritual worship but only practice darshan ( visual adoration ) of the deity . The ritual worship by the priests is restricted to five days each around the Ashadha ( June – July ) and Kartik ( October – November ) Ekadashis , when a large number of Varkaris participate in the <unk> . In smaller numbers , the Varkaris also visit the temple on two other Ekadashis — in the Hindu months of Magha and Chaitra . 
 More than 800 @,@ 000 Varkaris travel to Pandharpur for the yatra on Shayani Ekadashi , the 11th day of the waxing moon in the lunar month of Ashadha . Both Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodhini Ekadashi ( in the waxing half of Kartik ) , are associated with the mythology of Vishnu . Hindus believe that Vishnu falls asleep in <unk> ( a cosmic ocean of milk ) , while lying on the back of Shesha @-@ nāga ( the cosmic serpent ) . His sleep begins on Shayani Ekadashi ( literally the ' sleeping 11th ' ) and he finally awakens from his slumber , four months later , on Prabodhini Ekadashi . The celebrations in Ashadha and Kartik continue until the full @-@ moon in those months , concluding with torchlight processions . Inscriptions dating to the 11th century mention the Ekadashi pilgrimages to Pandharpur . On Shayani Ekadashi and <unk> Ekadashi , the chief minister or a minister of Maharashtra state performs ritual components of worship on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra . This form of worship is known as <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 Apart from the four Ekadashis , a fair is held on Dussera night at Pandharpur , when devotees dance on a large slab ( ranga @-@ <unk> ) before Vithoba , accompanied with torchlight processions . Other observances at the Pandharpur temple include : Ranga @-@ Panchami , when <unk> ( red powder ) is sprinkled on the god 's feet ; and Krishna Janmashtami , Krishna 's birthday , when devotees dance and sing in front of Vithoba for nine days . Other sacred days include Wednesdays , Saturdays and all other Ekadashis , all of which are considered holy in Vaishnavism . 
 = = = Devotional works = = = 
 Devotional works dedicated to Vithoba can be categorised into the Varkari tradition , the Brahmin tradition and what Raeside calls a " third tradition " , that includes both Varkari and Brahmin elements . The Varkari texts are written in Marathi , the Brahmin texts in Sanskrit , and the " third tradition " are Marathi texts written by Brahmins . 
 The Varkari texts are : <unk> and Bhaktavijaya by Mahipati , <unk> @-@ Mahatmya by <unk> , and a long abhanga by Namdev . All these texts describe the legend of Pundalik . The Brahmin texts include : two versions of Panduranga @-@ Mahatmya from the Skanda Purana ( consisting of 900 verses ) ; Panduranga @-@ Mahatmya from the Padma Purana ( consisting of 1 @,@ 200 verses ) ; Bhima @-@ Mahatmya , also from the Padma Purana ; and a third devotional work , yet again called Panduranga @-@ Mahatmya , which is found in the Vishnu Purana . The " third tradition " is found in two works : Panduranga @-@ Mahatmya by the Brahmin Sridhara ( consisting of 750 verses ) , and another work of the same name written by Prahlada Maharaj ( consisting of 181 verses ) . 
 In addition to the above , there are many abhangas , the short Marathi devotional poems of the Varkaris , and many <unk> ( songs of praise ) and stotras ( hymns ) , some of them originating from the Haridasa tradition . The best known of these is " <unk> " or " <unk> " , attributed to Adi Shankaracharya , although this attribution is questioned . A text called " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , attributed to Namdev or Dnyaneshwar but possibly a collection of writings of many poet @-@ saints , also centers on the propagation of Varkari faith and Vithoba worship . Other devotional works include <unk> like " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " by Namdev and " Yei O Vitthala <unk> <unk> re " . These <unk> sing of Vithoba , who wears yellow garments ( a characteristic of Vishnu ) and is served by Garuda ( mount of Vishnu ) and Hanuman ( the monkey god , devotee of Rama — an avatar of Vishnu ) . Finally , the Telugu poet <unk> Ramakrishna ( 16th century ) refers to Vithoba , as Panduranga , in his poem Panduranga @-@ <unk> : " ( O Parvati ) , accepting the services of Pundarika and <unk> ( Kala @-@ <unk> ) , becoming the wish fulfilling tree by assuming a subtle body for the sake of devotees , fulfilling their wishes , the deity Panduranga resides in that temple . " 
 = = = Temples = = = 
 There are many Vithoba temples in Maharashtra , and some in Karnataka , Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh . However , the main centre of worship is Vithoba 's temple in Pandharpur . The temple 's date of establishment is disputed , though it is clear that it was standing at the time of Dnyaneshwar in the 13th century . Along with Vithoba and his consorts — Rukmini , Satyabhama and Radha — other Vaishnava deities are worshipped . These include : Venkateshwara , a form of Vishnu ; Mahalakshmi , a form of Vishnu 's consort Lakshmi ; Garuda and Hanuman ( see previous section ) . Shaiva deities are also worshipped , such as : Ganesha , the elephant @-@ headed god of wisdom and beginnings ; Khandoba , a form of Shiva ; and Annapurna , a form of Shiva 's consort Parvati . The <unk> ( memorials ) of saints like Namdev , Chokhamela and Janabai , and of devotees such as Pundalik and Kanhopatra , are in and around the temple . Other significant temples in Maharashtra are located : at <unk> , the birthplace of Tukaram , which attracts visitors at all <unk> of the year ; at Kole ( Satara district ) , in memory of <unk> Bova , which has a fair on the fifth day of the bright fortnight ( waxing moon ) in Magha month ; at Kolhapur and Rajapur , which host fairs on Shayani Ekadashi and <unk> Ekadashi ; <unk> — a refuge of the Pandharpur image when it was moved to protect from Muslim invaders and finally at the Birla Mandir in <unk> . 
 Several temples are found in Goa , the well @-@ known ones being the temples at <unk> , <unk> and Gokarna Math . Similarly temple festivals celebrated in Vitthala temples in Margao , <unk> attract a lot a pilgrims . Vitthal is also worshipped as Vitthalnath at the <unk> in Rajasthan . 
 Vithoba was introduced to South India during the Vijayanagara and Maratha rule . In South India he is generally known as Vitthala . The Hampi temple ( mentioned above ) is a World Heritage site and the most important of Vitthala 's temples outside Maharashtra . Constructed in the 15th century , the temple is believed to have housed the central image from Pandharpur , which the Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya took " to enhance his own status " or to save the image from plunder by Muslim invaders . It was later returned to Pandharpur by <unk> ( 1448 – 1513 ) , the great @-@ grandfather of poet @-@ saint Eknath . Today , the temple stands without a central image , though between 1516 and 1565 , most important transactions , which would have been carried out previously in the presence of the original state deity Virupaksha ( a form of Shiva ) , were issued in presence of the central image of Vitthala . Three of Madhvacharya 's eight mathas ( monasteries ) in Karnataka — <unk> , <unk> and <unk> — have Vitthala as their presiding deity . A <unk> temple stands at <unk> , Karnataka . In Tamil Nadu , Vitthala shrines are found in Srirangam , <unk> near <unk> and in Tirunelveli district , and <unk> , <unk> near Kumbakonam and sculptures are also found in Kanchi . 
 = = Legend = = 
 Legends regarding Vithoba usually focus on his devotee Pundalik or on Vithoba 's role as a savior to the poet @-@ saints of the Varkari faith . As discussed in the devotional works section above , the Pundalik legend appears in the Sanskrit scriptures Skanda Purana and Padma Purana . It is also documented in Marathi texts : Panduranga @-@ Mahatmya by a Brahmin called Sridhara ; another work of the same name written by Prahlada Maharaj ; and also in the abhangas of various poet @-@ saints . 
 There are three versions of the Pundalik legend , two of which are attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana ( 1 @.@ 34 – 67 ) . According to the first , the ascetic Pundarika ( Pundalik ) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents . The god Gopala @-@ Krishna , a form of Vishnu , comes from Govardhana as a cowherd , accompanied by his grazing cows , to meet Pundarika . Krishna is described as in <unk> form , wearing makara @-@ kundala , the <unk> mark ( described above ) , a head @-@ dress of peacock feathers , resting his hands on his waist and keeping his cow @-@ stick between his thighs . Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form on the banks of the river Bhima . He believes that Krishna 's presence will make the site a tirtha and a kshetra . The location is identified with modern @-@ day Pandharpur , which is situated on the banks of the Bhima . The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba . 
 The second version of the legend depicts Vithoba appearing before Pundalik as the five @-@ year @-@ old Bala Krishna ( infant Krishna ) . This version is found in manuscripts of both Puranas , Prahlada Maharaj , and the poet @-@ saints , notably Tukaram . The remaining version of the Pundalik legend appears in Sridhara and as a variant in the Padma Purana . Pundalik , a Brahmin madly in love with his wife , neglected his aged parents as a result . Later , on meeting sage <unk> , Pundalik underwent a transformation and devoted his life to the service of his aged parents . Meanwhile , Radha , the milkmaid @-@ lover of Krishna , came to Dwarka , the kingdom of Krishna , and sat on his lap . Radha did not honour Rukmini , the chief queen of Krishna , nor did Krishna hold Radha accountable for the offence . Offended , Rukmini left Krishna and went to the forest of <unk> near Pandharpur . Saddened by Rukmini 's departure , Krishna searched for his queen and finally found her resting in <unk> , near Pundalik 's house . After some coaxing , Rukmini was pacified . Then Krishna visited Pundalik and found him serving his parents . Pundalik threw a brick outside for Krishna to rest on . Krishna stood on the brick and waited for Pundalik . After completing his services , Pundalik asked that his Lord , in Vithoba form , remain on the brick with Rukmini , in Rakhumai form , and bless His devotees forever . 
 Other legends describe Vithoba coming to the rescue of his devotees in the form of a commoner , an outcast Mahar " untouchable " or a Brahmin beggar . Mahipati , in his work <unk> , narrates how Vithoba helped female saints like Janabai in their daily chores , such as sweeping the house and pounding the rice . He narrates how Vithoba came to the aid of Sena the barber . The king of Bidar had ordered Sena to be arrested for not coming to the palace despite royal orders . As Sena was engrossed in his prayers to Vithoba , Vithoba went to the palace in the form of Sena to serve the king , and Sena was saved . Another tale deals with a saint , <unk> , the keeper of the royal grain store , who distributed grain to the people in famine . Vithoba came as an outcaste with a bag of gold to pay for the grain . Yet another story narrates how Vithoba resurrected the child of Gora <unk> ( potter ) , who had been trampled into the clay by Gora while singing the name of Vithoba .

 = = Biography = = 
 Rodney Atkins was born in Knoxville , Tennessee . His biological mother , who was 19 at the time , became pregnant with him after a " traumatic first date " . She hid the pregnancy from her parents and put him up for adoption at the Holston United Methodist Home for Children in Greeneville , Tennessee . His first adoptive parents , Charles Hutchins and Linda Weems , returned him to the home after he developed a major respiratory infection . Allan and Margaret Atkins , who had lost a newborn about a year prior , inquired after the child , but decided not to proceed due to surgery that Margaret had just undergone . Meanwhile , another couple adopted him , but also returned him soon after when he developed colic . After Margaret Atkins recovered , she proceeded to adopt him . Atkins did not meet his biological mother until 2008 , and has never revealed her identity . 
 The Atkins family moved frequently in his youth , eventually settling in Claiborne County , Tennessee . He attended high school at Powell Valley High in Speedwell , Tennessee . During high school , Atkins played guitar in his spare time at events and festivals . He went to college at Tennessee Technological University in <unk> , Tennessee , where he made friends with songwriters and soon began writing himself . In the mid @-@ 1990s , Atkins moved to Nashville , Tennessee to pursue a recording career . He signed with Curb Records in 1996 , the same week that LeAnn Rimes did .

 Atkins 's debut single , " In a Heartbeat " , spent one week at number 74 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks ( now Hot Country Songs ) chart dated for August 30 , 1997 . Its b @-@ side , " God Only Knows " , was also released as a single , but did not chart . His debut album was slated for release on September 17 of the same year , but it was never released due to Atkins ' dissatisfaction with his material . He discussed his dissatisfaction while sitting next to Curb Records owner Mike Curb on an airplane ; Curb allowed him to switch producers , and Atkins chose Ted Hewitt , with whom he had been working on demos . Hewitt also changed Atkins ' style from a cowboy appearance and a vocal style similar to Roy Orbison to a more polished appearance . Atkins , Hewitt , and Max T. Barnes wrote the track " Don 't Think I Won 't " on Mark Wills ' 1998 album Wish You Were Here , but he was otherwise inactive until 2002 . " In a Heartbeat " later appeared on the soundtrack of the 2008 film Camille .

 In mid @-@ 2002 , Rodney Atkins released his third single , " Sing Along " . Both it and its followup , " My Old Man " , peaked in the lower regions of the Top 40 on the country chart . He entered the Top 10 for the first time in late 2003 @-@ early 2004 with " Honesty ( Write Me a List ) " , which went on to peak at number 4 on the country charts and 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 . The song was the title track to his album Honesty , which was released by the end of 2003 . " Someone to Share It With " and " Monkey in the Middle " were also issued as singles , with the former peaking at number 41 on the country charts . Atkins told the Associated Press that he chose to record " Honesty " because he and producer Ted Hewitt wanted a twelfth song for the album , and co @-@ writer David Kent had recommended it to Hewitt . 
 Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time gave the album a mixed review . He thought that Atkins seemed too similar in sound to labelmate Tim McGraw , but praised some of the songs for having strong melodies . A more favorable review came from Matt Bjorke of About.com , who called it a " confident debut from a talented newcomer . " 
 = = = If You 're Going Through Hell = = = 
 Having been absent from the country music charts for most of 2004 and 2005 , he returned in 2006 with a single entitled " If You 're Going Through Hell ( Before the Devil Even Knows ) " , which served as the lead @-@ off to his second released album , If You 're Going Through Hell . With this album , Atkins once again changed his musical image . He started wearing baseball caps and performing " songs about his life . " " If You 're Going Through Hell " became his first number 1 , spending four weeks at the top of the Hot Country Songs charts ; it was also the top country hit of 2006 according to Billboard Year @-@ End . 
 Following " If You 're Going Through Hell " was " Watching You " , which Atkins wrote with Steve Dean and Brian Gene White . This song was inspired by Atkins ' son , Elijah , who also stars in its music video .

The album 's final single was " <unk> Shaken " , which Lee Greenwood previously recorded on his 2003 album Stronger Than Time . Atkins ' version of the song peaked at number 41 . If You 're Going Through Hell received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipments of one million copies , while " If You 're Going Through Hell " , " Watching You " , and " Cleaning This Gun " all received gold certifications for 500 @,@ 000 music downloads . These songs also made top 40 on the Hot 100 while they were climbing the country charts , while " These Are My People " reached number 42 . Atkins also received the 2006 Academy of Country Music award for Top New Male Vocalist , and " If You 're Going Through Hell " was nominated for Song of the Year . Atkins toured in late 2007 @-@ early 2008 as an opening act on Brad Paisley 's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour . 
 J. Poet of Allmusic gave the album a positive review , praising the " less produced sound " and Atkins ' vocals on the singles . A mixed review came from Country Standard Time , whose Robert Loy criticized Atkins for singing " about what a good ol ' boy he is " on several songs , but adding that " it 's fairly obvious he 's at least as country as anybody else on the charts these days " . 
 = = = It 's America = = = 
 Atkins ' thirteenth single , " It 's America " , was released in November 2008 . It was the first single from his third album , It 's America , released in March 2009 .

Its followup , " 15 Minutes " , was released in May 2009 and peaked at number 20 in September . Atkins re @-@ wrote the album 's third single , " Chasin ' Girls " , for his wife to make it more applicable to their life at the time . After executives at Curb saw the lyrics , the re @-@ written version was released as the album 's third single , but did not make top 40 .

 = Uriel Sebree = 
 Uriel Sebree ( February 20 , 1848 – August 6 , 1922 ) was a career officer in the United States Navy . He entered the Naval Academy during the Civil War and served until 1910 , retiring as a rear admiral . He is best remembered for his two expeditions into the Arctic and for serving as acting governor of American Samoa . He was also commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Pacific Fleet . 
 After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1867 , Sebree was posted to a number of vessels before being assigned to a rescue mission to find the remaining crew of the missing Polaris in the Navy 's first mission to the Arctic . This attempt was only a partial success — the Polaris crew was rescued by a British ship rather than the US Navy — but this led to Sebree 's selection eleven years later for a second expedition to the Arctic . That mission to rescue Adolphus Greely and the survivors of the Lady Franklin Bay expedition was a success . Sebree was subsequently appointed as the second acting governor of American Samoa . He served in this position for only a year before returning to the United States . In 1907 , he was promoted to rear admiral and given command of the Pathfinder Expedition around the South American coast before being appointed commander of the 2nd Division of the Pacific Fleet and then commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the entire fleet . He retired in 1910 and died in Coronado , California , in 1922 . Two geographical features in Alaska — Sebree Peak and Sebree Island — are named for Admiral Sebree . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Uriel Sebree was born in Fayette , Missouri , on February 20 , 1848 , to Judge John Sebree , called " one of the prominent citizens of old Howard County " by the Jefferson County Tribune , and his wife . Uriel was the first of two sons . His brother , Frank P. Sebree , became a lawyer . Uriel entered the United States Naval Academy on July 23 , 1863 , during the American Civil War . After his graduation in 1867 , his first assignment was on board USS Canandaigua . Over the next few years Sebree won repeated promotion : to ensign in 1868 , master in 1870 , and lieutenant in 1871 . In 1873 he transferred to the ironclad USS Dictator . 
 One episode in Sebree 's early military history which influenced his later career was his participation in the second Polaris rescue mission . The Polaris expedition was an 1871 – 72 exploration of the Arctic that had aimed to reach the North Pole . The expedition was troubled from the start : its leader , Charles Francis Hall , died in mysterious circumstances before the end of their first winter . The following year , the Polaris remained trapped in ice and unable to return home . During a violent storm , the crew was separated into two groups : a small group of explorers was stranded on the now @-@ crippled Polaris and the remainder were marooned on an ice floe . These latter 19 survivors were discovered by chance and rescued by the civilian whaler USS Tigress . Because of the Tigress 's success , the Navy chartered the ship , temporarily rechristened her USS Tigress , and used her to launch a rescue attempt to locate the remainder of the crew . For this attempt the ship would be commanded by a group of eight navy officers , led by Captain James A. Greer , although much of the original civilian crew was retained . Lieutenant Sebree was one of the officers chosen for the mission . 
 This rescue mission was the first official United States military expedition to the Arctic ; previous expeditions , including that of the Polaris itself , had been led by civilians . The Tigress sailed from New York on July 14 , 1873 , traveling first to St. John 's , Newfoundland and then to <unk> and Upernavik in Greenland before following the coast further north . The crew searched North Star Bay , Northumberland Island , and <unk> Bay before discovering the first sign of the Polaris crew : a camp on Littleton Island where they had wintered , now occupied by Inuit . The missing men , the rescuers were told , had constructed makeshift boats salvaged from their destroyed ship and traveled south . Acting on this clue , the Tigress searched the Baffin Island coast to Cumberland Sound , and then the Greenland coast from <unk> to <unk> and the Davis Strait , before returning to St. John 's for fuel . Once there , they learned that the Polaris survivors had been rescued by a British ship and that their search was over . After returning to New York the Tigress was transferred back to civilian use . 
 After this expedition , Sebree was assigned to the screw frigate USS Franklin where he remained for three years . In 1878 , he was assigned to work with the United States Coast Survey on board the A. D. Bache . The following year he was given his first two commands : the Silliman and then the Thomas R. Gedney , both ships of the United States Coast Survey . He remained on the latter ship for nearly three years before being assigned to USS Brooklyn in 1882 . In 1883 , he was given his first command of a Navy ship , USS Pinta , with orders to sail to Alaska . 
 = = = Court martial = = = 
 On October 3 , 1883 , prior to leaving for Alaska , the Pinta collided with the civilian brig Tally Ho off the coast of Nantucket . Sebree was not held directly responsible for the collision , as he was below deck at the time , but it was alleged that he did not do enough to determine whether the other ship was damaged before sailing away . Charges were brought against him in November and in December he was found guilty of " culpable negligence and inefficiency in the performance of his duty " . He was sentenced to be suspended from rank and duty for three years with an official reprimand from the Secretary of the Navy . Believing the sentence to be too harsh , Secretary William E. Chandler reduced it to a public reprimand only . Sebree was subsequently transferred to USS Powhatan , although not as the ship 's commanding officer . 
 = = = Greely Relief Expedition = = = 
 One month after joining the Powhatan , Sebree was transferred again , this time to serve as the executive officer of USS Thetis for another trip into the Arctic . In 1881 , Army Lieutenant Adolphus Greely had left on an expedition to establish a base at Lady Franklin Bay on northern Ellesmere Island ( now part of the Canadian territory of Nunavut ) . Greely was left with provisions for three years but was to expect supply ships in 1882 and 1883 . Both attempts to resupply the expedition failed and , with Greely 's provisions running low , the Navy prepared an expedition in early 1884 to attempt a resupply or rescue . The expedition was led by Captain Winfield Scott Schley and consisted of lead ship USS Thetis ( with Sebree as the executive officer and navigator ) , USS Bear , and the borrowed HMS Alert . Many of the officers , including Sebree , were selected for their previous Arctic experience . The Thetis left New York on May 1 , 1884 , and the group slowly progressed through the ice of Melville Bay , chasing clues and records left by the expedition , to finally discover the survivors of Greely 's camp off Cape Sabine on June 22 , 1885 . Of the 25 members of the expedition , only 6 survived ( one more died on the return journey ) . The expedition sailed first for Upernavik , Greenland , arriving on July 2 , 1884 , and then made its way back to the United States , landing at Portsmouth , New Hampshire on August 1 , 1884 . Schley later reported that a delay of just two more days would have been fatal to the remaining six members of the expedition . Sebree and the other members of the relief expedition gained fame from the voyage . Even ten years later , in 1895 , a report by The New York Times celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United States Naval Academy listed Sebree as one of the most " famous " graduates , despite his relatively low rank . 
 After his return from the expedition Sebree taught at the Naval Academy for two years before being transferred to the 13th Lighthouse District , to serve as the lighthouse inspector for Oregon and Washington Territory . While stationed there he was promoted to lieutenant commander in March 1889 . 
 = = = Valparaíso riots = = = 
 In September 1889 he was made the executive officer of USS Baltimore , again under Captain Schley . Both men were still serving aboard the Baltimore when its sailors were attacked in Valparaiso , Chile in October 1891 , and gave testimony toward the events during the later investigation . 
 From September 1892 to July 1893 , Sebree served as assistant to the inspector of the 3rd Lighthouse District . 
 Sebree taught at the Academy from 1893 to 1896 . At the end of his time there , he was briefly given command of USS Wheeling ( PG @-@ 14 ) before being put in command of the Thetis , which was doing survey work off the coast of California . In 1897 he was promoted to commander . During the Spanish – American War , Sebree again commanded the Wheeling in the Pacific for the duration of the war . His assignment was to patrol the coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands , far from both the Caribbean and Pacific theaters of the war , and he saw no significant action . After the war , he was transferred to the 12th Lighthouse District as an inspector . 
 = = American Samoa = = 
 On October 9 , 1901 , Sebree was promoted to captain and received orders to travel to American Samoa to take command of USS Abarenda ( AC @-@ 13 ) and to be commandant of the United States Naval Station Tutuila . Three days later , he was promoted to captain . At this time the commandant of the naval station was considered the acting governor of the territory as Congress had not yet formalized the U.S. Navy 's role there . Sebree was the replacement for Commandant Benjamin Franklin Tilley , who had recently had charges brought against him for immorality and drunkenness . While Sebree was in transit to the islands , Tilley was tried and acquitted of the charges against him but the decision to replace him was not changed . Captain Sebree arrived in Samoa and took up his new post on November 27 , 1901 . 
 = = = Acting governor = = = 
 Unlike Tilley , who had been the first acting governor of the territory , Sebree was very concerned about his legal status . Officially , he was only commandant of the naval station then under construction , although the deed of cession of the territory acknowledged his theoretical authority to govern the people . He was concerned that lawsuits could be brought against him or future acting governors until the situation was clarified and made official by the United States government . To this end , he made a recommendation to the United States Congress to assemble a panel to consider the territory 's status and requested that an Assistant Secretary of the Navy come to the territory to meet with him . Both requests were refused . A further example of this ambiguity came in March 1902 , when Sebree received orders to give up command of the Abarenda to give him additional time as commandant and " governor " . To these orders , he responded that he still had not been officially made " governor " and that , if he were to act as a governor , he should be given the proper credentials and legal authority to do so . The Navy did not respond directly to Sebree 's request , but he was given command of USS Wheeling three months later . 
 Despite his protests , Sebree did act as the governor of the territory . During his administration , the United States Congress approved $ 35 @,@ 000 to pay off debts related to construction costs for the naval station , and planning began for the construction of a lighthouse on <unk> 'u . The Fita Fita Guard , the local militia that Tilley had organized , continued its training , and Sebree arranged to train some members of the force as a military @-@ style brass band . Sebree also attempted to improve local agriculture and even petitioned the Department of Agriculture for assistance , but was turned down . 
 = = = Petition for civilian government = = = 
 Tensions escalated between foreign traders on Samoa and the local populace , due in part to controls which Tilley had put in place to protect Samoan farmers from exploitation . Dr. David Starr Jordan , a prominent American biologist doing research in the territory , was so concerned by these tensions that he sent a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt asking that a trader not be made governor of the territory , if a civil administration were created . Shortly after , many traders and locals , including a Samoan tax collector , circulated a petition requesting a change in the way the copra crop was taxed and asking for the Navy to cease governing the territory . The petition was sent to members of Congress and the cause was picked up by California representative Julius Kahn and gathered significant press coverage . This movement eventually reached President Roosevelt ; his decision was not to act on the petition . 
 On December 16 , 1902 , Sebree was granted a leave of absence to return to the United States and care for his wife who had been badly hurt in a fall . In his place , Lieutenant Commander Henry <unk> , Sebree 's executive officer , was made acting commandant of the station and therefore acting governor of the territory . He was also given command of the Wheeling . Captain Edmund Beardsley Underwood was selected as Sebree 's replacement , but that decision was not made official immediately , and Underwood remained in Washington to consult with Sebree and President Roosevelt on the governance of the territory . Underwood 's selection was not announced until May 1903 .

 Following his wife 's recovery , Sebree returned to service and was given command of USS Wisconsin ( BB @-@ 9 ) on February 11 , 1903 . The Wisconsin was the flagship of the North Squadron of the Pacific fleet under Robley D. Evans . While under Sebree 's command , the Wisconsin and her crew were evaluated as one of the best , according to annual targeting exercises . 
 = = = Nicholson court @-@ martial = = = 
 In the late summer of 1903 , Paymaster <unk> Nicholson of USS Don Juan de Austria assaulted a German Consul at a ball in Yantai , China . He was promptly brought up on charges of " drunkenness " , " scandalous conduct tending to the destruction of good morals " , and " falsehood " and taken to the Wisconsin for his court martial . Sebree and a group of six other officers found him guilty of the first charge , guilty of a lesser offense for the second charge , and not guilty on the third . His sentence was determined to be a reduction in grade equivalent to one year of seniority . Three of the officers , not including Sebree , wrote a supplementary opinion requesting clemency for Nicholson . 
 However , Rear Admiral Evans , the commander of the Asiatic Squadron , rejected the verdict as inadequate and requested that the court reconsider the decision . The court reconvened and returned the same judgment and sentence . In response , Evans wrote a scathing critique of the process , calling it a " travesty of justice " and stating that Nicholson 's actions were " less reprehensible than his judges " . This critical essay was required to be posted at every naval base and on every ship in the Pacific and was reprinted in full by The New York Times and other civilian newspapers . Evans banned the three officers who had publicly requested clemency from participating in future courts martial . Press reports questioned whether Evans had that authority as the military justice system was intended to be impartial . In late September 1903 , the three officers who had been named in the critique filed a protest with Secretary of the Navy William Henry Moody stating that Admiral Evans had overstepped his authority by publicly reprimanding them without a court martial and that charges should be brought against him . On November 18 , 1903 , Moody denied the petition and the sentences were left to stand . 
 During this controversy , Sebree remained silent on the issue , and it is unknown whether he was a member of the majority or not . Evans commented in his critique that he was unsure who the other supporters of the majority decision were . As criticism swirled around the trial itself , the editors of the magazine United Service defended Sebree and stated that he had " universal esteem throughout the Navy service " and that he had a " large experience , sound judgment , even temper and most excellent record " . Following this announcement , Sebree was transferred to the Naval War College in Rhode Island to work as an instructor and as Secretary of the Lighthouse Board . 
 = = = Lightship No. 58 incident = = = 
 In December 1905 , a storm and mechanical failures caused major problems for the crew of the <unk> Lightship No. 58 anchored off of Nantucket . Her crew , led by Captain James Jorgensen , fought for two days to prevent the vessel from foundering , but were ultimately unsuccessful . They were rescued by Captain Gibbs of the Azalea . The fallout over this incident caused enough of a stir that the military had to respond to it directly . Under Navy rules , the eleven officers and crew members of the No. 58 were denied pay while they were recovering from their injuries and until they were posted to new vessels under a regulation that prohibited pay to sailors whose ships had sunk . The sailors appealed to Sebree , as Secretary of the Lighthouse Board , but he did not or could not accommodate them . Instead , the officers were given commendations by Secretary Victor H. Metcalf and " preference in future appointments " . Admiral Dewey and Captain Sebree made a second recommendation , which was approved , that Captain Gibbs receive a commendation and a pay increase for his service . 
 = = = Pathfinder Squadron = = = 
 Sebree was promoted to rear admiral in 1907 and was given command of a squadron of two ships : his flagship , USS Tennessee , and USS Washington . This so @-@ called " Pathfinder Squadron " would travel from New York to California via Cape Horn . This mission allowed the Navy to show off two of its newest cruisers to South American governments as well as transfer ships to the Pacific Fleet in what was seen as an example of American gunboat diplomacy . Along the way , Sebree had formal meetings with Brazilian President Afonso Pena , Peruvian President José Pardo y Barreda , and United States diplomatic staff in both countries . He also met with representatives in Chile and other countries . When the squadron finally arrived in California , it was joined by USS California and participated in public @-@ relations events at West Coast ports . The diplomatic mission over , the Pathfinder Squadron , with the California and others , became the 2nd division of the United States Pacific Fleet , with Sebree remaining in command . Rear Admiral William T. Swinburne was placed in command of the full fleet . 
 On June 5 , 1908 , Sebree was nearly killed during a speed trial of the Tennessee off the coast of California . He had just completed a tour of the starboard boiler room when a steam pipe burst , instantly killing two officers and wounding ten others , three fatally . Witnesses reported that Sebree and other officers had left the boiler room only 50 seconds earlier . 
 In August 1908 , the full Pacific Fleet was dispatched to numerous ports in the Pacific Ocean on a diplomatic mission similar to the one undertaken by Sebree in South America the previous year . On this voyage , Sebree and Swinburne met with leaders and representatives from the Territory of Hawaii , the Philippines , Western Samoa , and Panama . While visiting the Western Samoan capital of Apia , Sebree was presented with a souvenir album of Samoan scenery in honor of his time as governor of neighboring American Samoa .

 On April 15 , 1909 , Admiral Swinburne , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Pacific Fleet , announced his retirement , and Sebree was appointed to replace him on May 17 . Good public relations remained a major goal of the fleet , and in June , the fleet was displayed at the Alaska – Yukon – Pacific Exposition . President William Howard Taft led the exposition 's opening ceremony , and many American dignitaries were in attendance . 
 Sebree 's final mission before his retirement saw him lead the Pacific Fleet on a tour of ports in east Asia . The fleet left San Francisco on September 5 , 1909 , sailing west to the Philippines , with only brief stops en route . Speed testing was a major goal of the early part of the voyage and he and his fleet of eight ships broke speed records by sailing to Honolulu in just over four days . Six of the eight ships were able to make the voyage in that time ; the Colorado and West Virginia had mechanical failures which prevented them from completing the voyage on time . On the Colorado , those failures led to the deaths of two crewmen due to a steam pipe explosion . From Hawaii , the fleet moved on to Manila where the ships performed target practices and exercises , as well as being cleaned and repainted , before resuming their primary mission by sailing to Yokohama , Japan . In Japan , the fleet dispersed and small groups of cruisers were dispatched to the ports of British @-@ controlled Hong Kong , Wusong in China , and Kobe , Japan . Afterwards , the fleet returned home . Just before Sebree 's retirement the Pacific Fleet was split into two : a smaller Pacific Fleet and an Asiatic Fleet commanded by Rear Admiral John Hubbard . On February 19 , 1910 , Sebree officially retired and was replaced as head of the Pacific Fleet by Rear Admiral Giles B. Harber . 
 Shortly after retiring , Sebree was given a farewell banquet which included British Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener as a notable guest and California Governor James Gillett as toastmaster . In retirement , Sebree continued to attend Navy functions . In 1916 , Sebree reported that the United States Navy lagged behind the world 's other major navies . A single dreadnought , he claimed , could ravage the entire Pacific Fleet which was at that time relying on submarines for defense . The Atlantic Fleet already had dreadnoughts in commission . 
 Sebree died at his home in Coronado , California on August 6 , 1922 . He and his wife , Anne Bridgman Sebree , are buried in Arlington National Cemetery . They had one son , John Bridgman Sebree ( 1889 @-@ 1948 ) , who served in the United States Marine Corps .

 Maryland Route 2 ( MD 2 ) is the longest state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The 79 @.@ 24 @-@ mile ( 127 @.@ 52 km ) route runs from Solomons Island in Calvert County north to an intersection with U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) and US 40 Truck ( North Avenue ) in Baltimore . The route runs concurrent with MD 4 through much of Calvert County along a four @-@ lane divided highway known as Solomons Island Road , passing through rural areas as well as the communities of Lusby , Port Republic , Prince Frederick , and Huntingtown . In Sunderland , MD 2 splits from MD 4 and continues north as two @-@ lane undivided Solomons Island Road into Anne Arundel County , still passing through rural areas . Upon reaching Annapolis , the route runs concurrent with US 50 and US 301 around the city . Between Annapolis and Baltimore , MD 2 runs along the Governor Ritchie Highway ( also known as the Ritchie Highway ) , a multilane divided highway that heads through suburban areas of businesses and residences , passing through Arnold , Severna Park , Pasadena , Glen Burnie , and Brooklyn Park . In Baltimore , the route heads north on city streets and passes through the downtown area of the city . 
 What would become part of MD 2 was originally planned as two different state roads in 1909 . The portion between Solomons and Annapolis was built as a gravel road called Solomons Island Road between 1910 and 1915 . The portion of road between Annapolis and Glen Burnie was built as part of the Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard , a road authorized in 1910 to connect Baltimore and Annapolis and was completed in 1924 with the construction of a bridge over the Severn River leading to Annapolis . A state road between Glen Burnie and Baltimore was completed in 1911 . MD 2 wad designated in 1927 between Solomons and Baltimore , using Solomons Island Road , streets through Annapolis , the Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard , and the state road between Glen Burnie and Baltimore . MD 2 was marked up to US 1 in Baltimore in 1939 . In the 1930s , MD 2 was realigned onto the four @-@ lane Governor Ritchie Highway between Annapolis and Baltimore , the former routing along Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard became MD 648 . Ritchie Highway became a divided highway in 1950 . Between the 1930s and the 1950s , several upgrades and realignments occurred to the portion of MD 2 between Solomons and Annapolis . MD 2 was realigned to bypass Annapolis on the US 50 freeway in 1955 , with MD 450 replacing the route through Annapolis . The route between Solomons and Sunderland became concurrent with MD 416 in 1960 , which was renumbered to MD 4 in 1965 . Between the 1960s and the 1980s , MD 2 / MD 4 between Solomons and Sunderland was widened into a divided highway , with the bypassed former alignments becoming multiple sections of MD 765 . The Ritchie Highway portion of the route was originally the main route between Annapolis and Baltimore until Interstate 97 ( I @-@ 97 ) was completed in the 1990s .

 MD 2 serves as a north – south route located a short distance to the west of the Chesapeake Bay in Calvert and Anne Arundel counties and in the city of Baltimore in Maryland . In Calvert County , the route runs through mostly rural areas , passing through the communities of Solomons Island , Lusby , Port Republic , Prince Frederick , Huntingtown , Sunderland , and Owings . Between Solomons Island and Sunderland , the route runs concurrent with MD 4 . In Anne Arundel County , MD 2 runs through rural areas of the southern part of the county before reaching the Annapolis area , where it shares a concurrency with the John Hanson Highway . From Annapolis , the route heads through suburban areas in the northern part of Anne Arundel County as the Ritchie Highway , passing through Arnold , Severna Park , Pasadena , Glen Burnie , and Brooklyn Park . It continues north into Baltimore , where it heads toward its terminus north of the downtown area . At 79 @.@ 24 mi ( 127 @.@ 52 km ) , it is the longest state highway in Maryland .

 Solomons Island Road was one of the original state roads marked for improvement to form a statewide system by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909 . The highway was graded and surfaced as an improved dirt road from Owings south to Hunting Creek in 1910 and 1911 and from there to Prince Frederick between 1911 and 1913 . Solomons Island Road from Prince Frederick south to Solomons was graded and surfaced as a dirt road in 1913 except for two segments : a 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) wide shell road was built through Solomons and a 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) wide gravel road was built for 3 @.@ 6 miles ( 5 @.@ 8 km ) through Lusby . This highway was improved to a gravel road for its whole length and several dangerous curves were modified by 1919 . Solomons Island Road from Lothian to Edgewater was built as a 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) wide gravel road in 1915 . The state road between Edgewater and Annapolis was also finished by 1915 . 
 In 1910 , the Maryland General Assembly authorized funding for the construction of a boulevard between Annapolis and Baltimore . This boulevard , which would have a minimum road width of 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) , would begin in Annapolis , cross the Severn River , head northwest to Glen Burnie , and continue through Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties to the tracks of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in South Baltimore . The newly formed Maryland State Roads Commission was placed in charge of constructing the new Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard . The boulevard was constructed as a 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) wide macadam road from the Severn River north to Arnold and from Severna Park to Pasadena in 1910 and 1911 . The sections between Arnold and Severna Park and from Pasadena to Glen Burnie were completed in 1912 . The boulevard followed much of what is today MD 648 , with the major difference being in Pasadena , where instead of following Waterford Road north to MD 177 , the boulevard headed northwest along what are discontinuous segments of MD 915 to <unk> Corner . 
 Unrelated to the Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard , the commission constructed a 14 @-@ to @-@ 18 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 to 5 @.@ 5 m ) wide macadam road from Glen Burnie to Brooklyn , which was then in Anne Arundel County , in 1915 . In Brooklyn , the new highway connected with the south end of the Light Street Bridge that crossed the Patapsco River into Baltimore . With a road completed from Annapolis to Baltimore , the roads commission suggested that it should not be required to complete a road between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore . The commission asked the Maryland General Assembly to pass a bill releasing the commission from the responsibility of completing the highway from Glen Burnie to South Baltimore . However , the Maryland General Assembly disagreed with the Maryland State Roads Commission and passed a bill in 1914 requiring the commission to finish the boulevard between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore . The Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard north from Glen Burnie to Baltimore was finished in 1916 . The final gap in the Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard was filled when the first modern Severn River Bridge was completed in 1924 . This 1 @,@ 850 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 560 m ) concrete bridge , which had a roadway width of 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) and a steel bascule draw with a horizontal clearance of 75 feet ( 23 m ) , replaced a narrow one @-@ lane bridge . The entire length of the Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard was widened to 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) with a pair of 3 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) wide concrete shoulders by 1927 . The highway 's bridge over Marley Creek was rebuilt from a width of 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) to 36 feet ( 11 m ) in 1926 . 
 When Maryland assigned state route numbers in 1927 , MD 2 was designated between Solomons and Baltimore . The route followed Solomons Island Road from Solomons to west of Annapolis , where it ran concurrent with US 50 into the city on West Street . MD 2 passed through downtown Annapolis on College Avenue and King George Street before it left the city on the Severn River Bridge and continued north along Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard to Glen Burnie . From Glen Burnie , MD 3 continued along Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard while MD 2 headed north to Baltimore and connected to Potee Street . MD 2 was designated in Baltimore in 1939 to follow Hanover Street north to US 1 . 
 = = = Improvements = = = 
 In 1930 , a concrete cut @-@ off was built in Glen Burnie that allowed MD 2 traffic to bypass the community 's central intersection to the northeast . In 1934 , the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended expanding Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard to at least 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) in width for its entire length , with a width of 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) urged from MD 177 to MD 3 and on MD 2 from the center of Glen Burnie to Furnace Branch . The first portion of Governor Ritchie Highway was completed as a four @-@ lane divided upgrade to existing MD 2 from the Baltimore city limit in Brooklyn Park to Furnace Branch in 1934 and 1935 . Construction on the remainder of Governor Ritchie Highway began in 1936 and was completed south from Furnace Branch to the Severn River in 1938 . All old segments of MD 2 were redesignated MD 648 by 1939 , with MD 2 designated on the Governor Ritchie Highway . This highway was named for former Maryland Governor Albert C. Ritchie . The Governor Ritchie Highway portion of MD 2 was upgraded to a divided highway in 1950 . Throughout the mid 20th @-@ century , a commercial district developed along MD 2 in Glen Burnie , which included several car dealerships and the Harundale Mall . In 1953 , the freeway to the north of Annapolis was completed . A divided highway connector between Solomons Island Road and this freeway was built in 1955 , and MD 2 was rerouted to bypass Annapolis along with US 50 on this freeway . The former alignment of US 50 and MD 2 in Annapolis was designated as MD 450 . 
 By 1934 , the Maryland State Roads Commission proposed Solomons Island Road be widened from 16 to 18 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 to 5 @.@ 5 m ) to 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) from Owings to MD 509 . The first upgrades to MD 2 between Solomons and Prince Frederick occurred in 1937 , when the highway was widened and resurfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel from Prince Frederick south to Port Republic . The highway was upgraded from Port Republic south through St. Leonard to beyond Quaker Swamp , with several relocations including a relocation at that creek , in 1939 and 1940 . The MD 2 reconstruction continued south a few miles to the northern end of Lusby in 1942 , a stretch widened to 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) and resurfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel . The highway through Lusby was relocated , reconstructed , and surfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel in 1944 . The gravel portions of MD 2 from Port Republic to Lusby were bituminous stabilized in 1946 . The reconstruction of MD 2 from Prince Frederick to Solomons concluded in 1949 when the highway from Solomons north to the southern end of Lusby was relocated , resurfaced , and surfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel . 
 MD 2 originally followed Armory Road through the northern part of Prince Frederick . By 1946 , the highway had been relocated to its modern alignment and paved north of Armory Road to Sunderland . The bypassed portion of Armory Road was marked as MD 750 by 1950 but may have been removed from the state highway system by 1952 . MD 2 was widened to 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) and resurfaced with bituminous concrete through Prince Frederick in 1950 . This improvement occurred contemporaneously with or shortly before the construction of the Prince Frederick bypass ; MD 2 moved to the new 24 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) wide bituminous stabilized gravel highway in the autumn of 1951 . The bypass was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1954 and 1955 . By 1956 , the old road through the county seat was marked as the first section of MD 765 . 
 The route was paved between Owings and Edgewater by 1946 . MD 2 from Owings to Edgewater starting receiving its first major upgrades in the 1950s , including several relocations of the highway . The bypassed portions of MD 2 became segments of MD 778 , with the letter suffix on the highway designation corresponding to the order the sections were bypassed . The highway from Edgewater south to Harwood ( then known as Butlers ) was widened and resurfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel in 1950 and 1951 . MD 2 from Harwood south to Lothian was widened and resurfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel in 1952 and 1953 . Old Solomons Island Road between Harwood Road and Polling House Road in Harwood remained part of the state highway system until 1987 . 
 In 1960 , MD 416 was designated concurrent with MD 2 between Solomons and Sunderland . In 1965 , the MD 416 concurrency was replaced by an overlap with MD 4 . Also , MD 2 was shifted to a new alignment between Sunderland and Owings , with the former route becoming MD 765 . MD 2 / MD 4 was widened to a divided highway between Huntingtown and the split in Sunderland in 1967 . The divided highway was extended to south of Huntingtown in 1969 , bypassing Huntingtown to the east . The former alignment through the community became MD 524 . In 1970 , MD 2 / MD 4 became a divided highway between Prince Frederick and south of Huntingtown . In January 1978 , MD 4 was rerouted north of Solomons onto the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge over the Patuxent River . In 1979 , the divided highway was extended south from Prince Frederick to Port Republic . MD 2 / MD 4 was shifted west to a new divided highway between south of St. Leonard to Port Republic in 1981 , with the former two @-@ lane routing designated part of MD 765 . In 1987 , MD 2 / MD 4 between Solomons and south of St. Leonard was shifted to a new divided highway . The bypassed alignment through Lusby and Solomons became another part of MD 765 . 
 The Ritchie Highway was originally the main route between Baltimore and Annapolis prior to the completion of I @-@ 97 in 1995 . Originally , MD 10 was intended to provide a limited @-@ access route between Baltimore and Annapolis , but this route was not completed south of Pasadena after it was deemed that an alternative freeway along the MD 3 corridor ( present @-@ day I @-@ 97 ) , which required less destruction of residences and businesses , should be built . 
 In 2010 , a project improved the intersection of MD 2 / MD 4 and MD 231 in Prince Frederick . This project is a prelude to a larger project to expand MD 2 / MD 4 to six lanes between MD 765 south of Prince Frederick and <unk> Road north of Prince Frederick .

 Maryland Route 2 Truck is a truck bypass of the Federal Hill neighborhood south of downtown Baltimore , Maryland , United States . The route runs east from MD 2 ( Hanover Street ) on McComas Street , paralleling I @-@ 95 . From McComas Street , at exit 55 of Interstate 95 just west of the Fort McHenry Tunnel , the route continues onto Key Highway and heads north and west to Light Street ( MD 2 ) , mostly paralleling the Northwest Harbor and serving the piers on the harbor . 
 The road was laid out to a width of 160 feet ( 50 m ) from Light Street to Locust Point in the early 1910s , providing better access to the new city @-@ owned piers in preparation for increased trade via the Panama Canal and existing steamship lines to Europe . It was named Key Highway because it was originally planned to extend to Fort McHenry , near where Francis Scott Key wrote " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner . " However , the extension of the road to the fort was never built . A rail line ran the length of Key Highway , connecting to the tracks in Pratt Street via Light Street . A two @-@ lane extension of the highway and rail line was built in 1930 , branching off the old route east of Ludlow Street and running south under Fort Avenue to McComas Street . The short portion of the old road east of the extension is now East Key Highway ; the rail tracks have been removed .

Southtown Center consists of 534 @,@ 650 square feet ( 50 @,@ 000 m2 ) of retail space . The center contains 38 retail tenants and is anchored by AMF Bowling Centers , Bed Bath & Beyond , Herberger 's , Kohl 's , and T.J. Maxx . 
 The first phase of Southtown Center opened on November 3 , 1960 , with two more phases proceeding in 1963 and 1964 . The mall is partially enclosed , while the majority of the center contains open air structures . Several additional buildings were constructed on the property throughout the years , while minimal renovations took place to maintain the mall 's appearance .

 = = = 1960 – 62 : Construction , grand opening , and additions = = = 
 Southtown Center opened on November 3 , 1960 in Bloomington , Minnesota and became Bloomington 's " first regional shopping center " . The center was developed by Kraus @-@ Anderson , Inc . , a Bloomington @-@ based construction firm , with founder Lloyd Engelsma taking over as the site 's project manager . According to Engelsma , Southtown was built atop " a strip of cow pasture " near a busy intersection in Bloomington , taking up nearly 37 acres of land ; Engelsma had " high expectations for the new center . " During construction of the mall , three labor strikes occurred which heavily delayed construction ; <unk> and inclement weather created further setbacks during the construction . Montgomery Ward , a Chicago @-@ based department store , announced that they would be opening up a location at Southtown , and became the mall 's only anchor ; Ward filled a 188 @,@ 050 square feet ( 17 @,@ 000 m2 ) building , the largest Ward department store in the United States . 
 After the center 's opening , several additions took place at the mall . During 1963 , a 43 @,@ 000 square feet ( 4 @,@ 000 m2 ) AMF Bowling Center was constructed on the north side of the property ; the bowling alley is still currently in use today . In 1964 , a Mann Theatres was constructed on the property ; Southtown Mann Theatre became the first movie theater to be attached to a shopping center in the Twin Cities . However , the cinema was completely remodeled in 1980 , removing some its original decor , before being torn down in 1995 to make way for additional retail .

 Montgomery Ward prospered as Southtown 's largest tenant until 1998 , when Ward announced that they would be closing nine underperforming locations as part of their " ongoing operations and strategic initiatives to return to profitability . " Filling Ward 's vacancy was Herberger 's , a Minnesota department store , who had agreed to purchase several other closed Montgomery Ward stores in the Twin Cities area . Toys " R " Us agreed to lease the other side of the Ward store that Herberger 's hadn 't leased . 
 In September 2014 , several plans were created by the city of Bloomington in order to rezone several parts of the shopping center . However , Southtown 's owner , Kraus @-@ Anderson , stated that the rezoning would " threaten Southtown 's existence and that customers like things how they are . " Several Bloomington locals and customers of Southtown created a website to persuade the city of Bloomington not to continue with any redeveloping plans . Despite the creation of the website and Kraus @-@ Anderson 's frustration and concern during the proposed redevelopment , the city council approved the project in July 2015 . In April of the same year , Southtown 's 44 @,@ 548 square feet ( 4 @,@ 100 m2 ) Toys " R " Us closed after their 26 @-@ year lease expired . Despite this closing , Southtown Center has maintained a 99 percent occupancy rate for many years . 
 = Always Be My Baby = 
 " Always Be My Baby " is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey , taken from her fifth studio album , Daydream ( 1995 ) . It was released by Columbia Records on March 9 , 1996 as the third U.S. single and fourth overall . The song was written by Carey , Jermaine Dupri and Manuel Seal , who also produced the song . A mid @-@ tempo song , its lyrics describe the feeling of attachment and unity Carey feels towards her estranged lover , even though they are no longer together . She says he will always be a part of her and will " always be her baby " even after they move on . 
 Music critics praised " Always Be My Baby " . The song became Carey 's 11th chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100 , tying her with Madonna and Whitney Houston for most number one singles for a female artist . It spent two weeks atop the chart and became Carey 's eighth chart @-@ topper on the Canadian Singles Chart . In other regions , the song performed moderately , peaking at number three in the United Kingdom , number five in New Zealand , number 17 in Australia and in the top 20 in most music markets where it charted . 
 The song 's music video features scenes of Carey frolicking by a campsite , as well as swinging on a large swing over a lake . Additional inter @-@ cuts include scenes of two children , one male and female , sneaking out at night and spending time together by a campfire similar to Carey 's location . Most scenes from the video were filmed at The Fresh Air Fund 's Camp Mariah , named after Mariah Carey for her generous support and dedication to Fresh Air Fund children . The song was performed live during her Daydream World Tour ( 1996 ) and many of her future tours and concerts . " Always Be My Baby " was also featured in Carey 's compilation albums : Number 1 's ( 1998 ) , Greatest Hits ( 2001 ) , The Ballads ( 2008 ) and Number 1 to Infinity ( 2015 ) . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 While Carey was writing and recording Daydream in early 1995 , she began searching for different producers , in order to give her work a new sound . Jermaine Dupri , who had risen to fame during that period , began working with Carey on material for her album . After recording the song in December 1994 , Carey recalled that she chose to work with Dupri because he had a " very distinct vibe . " Additionally , Carey commissioned the assistance of hip @-@ hop and contemporary R & B producer , Manuel Seal . As Seal played different keys on the piano , Carey led him with the melody she was " hearing inside her head " and began humming the phrase " always be my baby . " In an interview with Fred Bronson , Carey discussed the process it took to write and produce the song : 
 Jermaine , Manuel and I sat down and Jermaine programmed the drums . I told him the feel I wanted and Manuel put his hands on the keyboards and I started singing the melody . We went back and forth with the bridge and the B @-@ section . I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing ' Always be my baby ' off the top of my head . 
 Like producers before him , Dupri commended Carey 's vocal abilities , " she can pretty much do anything with her voice . She 's really strong vocally . " Another musical craft the song featured was the inclusion of heavy background vocals of her lower registers , with Carey then belting and singing the higher notes over the her background vocals and melody , creating a " double voice effect . " When discussing the technique used in the background vocals , Carey said : 
 The background vocals are an important part of the picture for me . That 's why I like to do them myself a lot of the time , or initially I 'll lay down the tracks . I 'll double my voice or do a couple of tracks of my own voice . It 's easy for me to match my voice . And then if I 'm going to use other background singers , I 'll let them go on top of mine . 
 = = Composition = =

 The music video for " Always Be My Baby " was the second video Carey 's directed . In it , she is the seemingly happy narrator of a tale of young love , as a young boy and a girl elope in the middle of the night . The video was filmed on location at Carey 's sponsored charity , the Fresh Air Fund upstate New York camp . The video begins with scenes of Carey on a lakeside tire @-@ swing , smiling and beginning to retell a story of young love . As she sits upon the swing , scenes of two children sneaking out of their bungalow in the middle of the night are shown . They frolic together beside a fireplace , soon coming up to the lakeside swing Carey had been on before . They soon go swimming wearing their clothes , much like Carey did in her video for " Dreamlover " though she does not jump into the water herself this time . As they jump into the water , Carey is then seen by the campfire they passed on their journey to the lake , smiling with friends and enjoying herself by the fire . Eventually the boy and girl are seen kissing underwater . The video concludes with scenes of the young boy and girl walking together back to their bungalow , walking hand @-@ in @-@ hand . Having possibly witnessed the entire event , Carey is seen once again by the large swing , chuckling and staring into the night 's sky . 
 An alternate video was shot for the song 's remix . It too was directed by Carey , and was shot in black and white . The shot of Carey in a beret that would become the cover for this single is a scene from the video . The video features cameo appearances by Da Brat and Xscape . It begins with Carey and the duo spending time recording the song in Carey 's in @-@ home studio . In the video , Carey is wearing a large white , straw hat and features long golden hair . As the trio finishes the song , scenes of Carey by her pool are shown , with cameos made by her dog , Jack . Brat and Xscape are seen poolside with Carey , playing cards and drinking beer , as the trio further bond and laugh . Towards the end of the video , scenes of the trio in the studio are shows , and intermingled with snippets of Carey walking inside her mansion , shared with then husband Tommy Mottola . The video ends with Carey and Brat bonding by the studio and pool .

In Phoebe ’ s hospital room , Ross and Rachel enter with bad news : her doctor fell and hit her head in the shower , meaning she 's unable to make it to the birth . The replacement doctor , Dr. <unk> assures Phoebe that she 's in good hands , until he spontaneously declares his admiration for Fonzie , from Happy Days several times . Phoebe demands that Ross goes and find her another doctor , but when the replacement is too young for her liking , Dr. <unk> returns . She moreover begs Rachel to talk to her brother Frank , and convince him to let her keep one of the triplets , after having second thoughts over the surrogate process . In the delivery room , Phoebe gives birth to two girls and a boy . Rachel breaks the news to Phoebe that she won ’ t be able to keep one of the babies . She asks her friends to leave , in order to have a moment alone with the triplets . 
 Rachel informs Monica ( Courteney Cox ) that she has managed to find two male nurses who would be willing to go out on a date with either of them . Monica declines the offer at first , not wanting to jeopardize her secret relationship with Chandler ( Matthew Perry ) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan , Monica decides to date him after all . Chandler in response asks a female nurse to go out on a date with him ; she declines immediately , adding to his embarrassment . After Phoebe gives birth , Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if she is really going to date Dan . She replies to him that since both of them are just " goofing around " , she figured why not " goof around " with Dan too ; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary , noting the technical definition is “ two friends who care a lot about each other , and have amazing sex , and just want to spend more time together ” . Monica , smitten by Chandler 's words , kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan . 
 Meanwhile , Joey is in a hospital room of his own , where a doctor informs him that he 's suffering from kidney stones . As they 're too close to his bladder , Joey is given two options : wait until he passes them naturally , or have a procedure , which he finds too invasive . Opting for the former , he gives ' birth ' to the kidney stones , concurrent with Phoebe ’ s birth .

 " The One Hundredth " was co @-@ written by show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman and directed by Kevin S. Bright . The episode takes place in a hospital , meaning none of the usual filming sets were used , thus surprising several members of the audience . Crane commented that the hundred episode was a " big milestone " for the series and to mark the major event , Lisa Kudrow 's character Phoebe would give birth to triplets . This brought a culmination to the surrogacy story arc , which began in the fourth season ; it was developed to accommodate Lisa Kudrow 's real life pregnancy . When Kudrow accepted the surrogate mother storyline , the idea of having more than one baby was " comically funny " to Kauffman , and giving birth to triplets or " their brother 's children " was something never seen on television . Phoebe 's pregnancy gave the writers incredible license for her to " be just outrageously mean and still have it be funny " . In order to prepare for the labor and birthing scenes , Kauffman watched a video of her cousin giving birth . 
 In earlier drafts of the episode , the idea of Phoebe keeping one of the babies was more extreme . The writers decided instead they were better off having the character saying goodbye to keep it dramatic . The birth scenes were recorded in advance to deal with light sensitivity and noise issues . Heidi Beck , a professional nurse was retained ; she acquired a stop watch for every minute the baby was under the light . Real life triplets were used and coated with grape jelly as an alternative to vernix . In the final scene , dolls were employed as it was filmed in front of the studio audience . 
 The main subplot involved Monica and Chandler discussing their relationship . The writers felt they needed an additional subplot , involving Joey going through a parallel experience to Phoebe 's pregnancy — the difference being him " giving birth " to a kidney stone . This meant doing research on the condition , finding it " really disturbing stuff " . Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry had a difficult time filming the prognosis scene as actor Iqbal Theba , who played Joey 's doctor , pronounced ' kidney stone ' in a humorous manner .

 In its original American broadcast , " The One Hundredth " finished second in ratings for the week of October 5 – 11 , 1998 , with a Nielsen rating of 17 @.@ 7 . It was the second @-@ highest rated show on the NBC network that week after ER . In the United Kingdom the episode premiered on Sky1 on January 21 , 1999 and was watched by 2 @.@ 17 million viewers , making the program the most watched on the channel that week . 
 Entertainment Weekly rated the episode " B " , in its review of the fifth season . It criticized the " Arthur <unk> @-@ obsessed obstetrician , " plot , though going on to praise Phoebe 's " sweet interaction " with the newborn babies . Robert Bianco of USA Today felt the episode made use of the entire ensemble , noting " Phoebe 's predictably and humorously off @-@ center response to labor " being the highlight . Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide disapproved of Ribisi 's performance , adding " Ultimately , “ One Hundredth ” had some good moments , but it wasn ’ t a great episode . " 
 " The One Hundredth " was Kudrow 's favorite episode of the series . She liked the episode as " it was nice that Phoebe could play such a big part in something as momentous as the 100th episode " . 
 = Scott Special = 
 The Scott Special , also known as the Coyote Special , the Death Valley Coyote or the Death Valley Scotty Special , was a one @-@ time , record @-@ breaking ( and the best @-@ known ) passenger train operated by the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ( Santa Fe ) from Los Angeles , California , to Chicago , Illinois , at the request of " Death Valley Scotty " . At the time of its transit in 1905 , the Scott Special made the 2 @,@ 265 @-@ mile ( 3 @,@ 645 km ) trip between the two cities at the fastest speed recorded to date ; in doing so , it established the Santa Fe as the leader in high @-@ speed travel between Chicago and the West Coast . The Scott Special made the trip in 44 hours and 54 minutes breaking the previous records , set in 1900 by the Peacock Special , by 13 hours and 2 minutes , and in 1903 by the Lowe Special , by 7 hours and 55 minutes . Santa Fe 's regular passenger service from Los Angeles to Chicago at the time was handled on a 2 ½ <unk> schedule by the California Limited . It was not until the 1936 introduction of the Super Chief that Santa Fe trains would regularly exceed the speeds seen on the Scott Special . 
 = = Background = = 
 Death Valley Scotty ( born September 20 , 1872 , as Walter Edward Scott ) had used some ore samples he collected near Cripple Creek , Colorado , as a ruse to convince some bankers in 1902 that he had a claim on a high @-@ grade ore mine in Death Valley , California . By 1905 he had conned the banks out of nearly $ 10 @,@ 000 . Another con he ran in 1905 earned Scott an additional $ 4 @,@ 000 . It was then that he met E. Burdon Gaylord , the owner of the Big Bell mine . Gaylord needed a flashy way to promote his mine and Scott sought the money behind the mine ; the two formed a partnership in which Gaylord would finance Scott and Scott would promote the mine like no other . 
 After a few high @-@ priced and newsworthy train trips around the southwest , Scott met with the Santa Fe 's General Passenger Agent , J. J. Byrne , at the railroad 's office in Los Angeles on July 8 , 1905 . Once Scott ( who had already travelled cross @-@ country on the Santa Fe some thirty @-@ two times ) got in to talk to Byrne , the arrangements were made , thanks to a deposit from Scott of $ 5 @,@ 500 in cash . The two agreed on a 46 @-@ hour schedule from Los Angeles to Chicago that would begin the following day . 
 The passenger list for the train was a mere four people : Scott himself , his wife , F. N. Holman , and Charles E. Van Loan , a writer for the Los Angeles Examiner ( and one who was adept at helping Scotty create his " miner " persona , inflating the amounts Scotty really spent while " promoting " his " mine " ) . The schedule involved operating a three car train across the system , led by no less than 19 different locomotives . The engineers of these locomotives came to be known as the " <unk> Nineteen " . 
 = = Equipment used = = 
 The special train consisted of three passenger cars pulled by one locomotive . The three cars used were baggage car # 210 , dining car # 1407 , and Pullman Muskegon . Altogether , the three cars weighed a total of 170 short tons ( 155 metric tons ) . While the three cars remained constant throughout the run of the Scott Special , the locomotive did not . In order to prevent delays on the trip as the train would need to stop for water and fuel , nineteen locomotives were prepared along the route so that as one reached the end of its supplies , it would relay the three cars off to the next fully fueled and ready locomotive to continue the run . For the more strenuous grades over Cajon Pass in California and Raton Pass in New Mexico and Colorado , helpers were added to get the train up and over the summits . At various points throughout the run , problems such as <unk> did occur , or in one instance a complete mechanical failure of the locomotive , but in each case , the train 's crew was able to get the train to the next relay point , and they usually arrived ahead of schedule . 
 = = Route and schedule = = 
 The special departed from Santa Fe 's La Grande Station in Los Angeles at 1 : 00 pm Pacific Time on July 9 , 1905 . The locomotive and three cars left the station and the cheering crowds , estimated at 20 @,@ 000 people , and began its run eastward . The number of people at La Grande Station is remarkable in itself since the train 's schedule was planned only one day before the event ; the Santa Fe used the train as an opportunity to publicize itself and got the word out to news agencies across the railroad 's territory . 
 In rail transport terminology , the Scott Special operated as an " extra " train . Normally such trains are not allowed any special considerations for schedule and are switched into sidings to clear the main line for the railroad 's regularly scheduled trains . For this run , however , the special was afforded rights over all of the railroad 's regular trains ; all other trains were required to clear the main line no less than one hour before the special was scheduled to pass . As most of the Santa Fe was still a single track railroad , this meant that quite a few regular trains were put into sidings to wait for the special . This accommodation , along with the numerous locomotive changes en route helped to ensure that the train would arrive in Chicago within the 46 @-@ hour schedule . 
 The first locomotive and crew change occurred in Barstow after the train had passed through Cajon Pass . At one point after passing Cajon summit , the train was clocked at 96 mph ( 155 km / h ) . The locomotive and crew were again changed successively at Needles , Seligman , Williams , Winslow and Gallup before the train arrived in Albuquerque , New Mexico , at 9 : 30 am on July 10 . 
 To cross Raton Pass , locomotives and crews were changed at Las Vegas , Raton and La Junta . From La Junta , the train was powered by a succession of 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 type locomotives that were swapped across the plains in Syracuse , Dodge City , Newton , Emporia , Argentine and Marceline to the Mississippi River crossing at Shopton , Iowa , near Fort Madison . Locomotive 530 was scheduled to take the train completely between Dodge City and Newton , but a burst cylinder head in Kent necessitated adding locomotive 1095 for the 26 miles ( 42 km ) between Kent and Newton . 
 En route , Scott and his guests enjoyed the finest meals that the Fred Harvey Company had to offer . Menu selections included such luxurious offerings as caviar , iced consommé , and Porterhouse steak à la Coyote . 
 One more locomotive and crew took the train to Chillicothe where it made its final locomotive change for the last leg into Chicago . Engineer Charles <unk> piloted the train for its entire run across Illinois , at an average speed of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) , staying aboard the train during the locomotive change in Chillicothe . The train officially arrived at Dearborn Station at 11 : 54 am Central Time on July 11 . 
 = = Legacy and preservation = = 
 The speed record set by the Scott Special stood for many years and was not beaten in regular service until the introduction of the Super Chief in 1936 . What makes the Scott Special especially remarkable is that it was run under normal operating conditions : 
 [ The ] run was made under normal conditions of track , motive power , and equipment , and practically on a moment 's notice . No racing machines were used . The locomotives were the plain , everyday kind , taken from regular runs and manned by employees taking their regular turn . To be sure , the main line was kept clear , and even the exclusive California Limited put on the side track . The Scott Special had the right @-@ of @-@ way . That was the only favor shown it , though the engineers understood they had permission to ' let her out a few notches ' , and they did so , when they could with safety . 
 In 1955 , on the 50th anniversary of the special 's run , the Scott Special was re @-@ enacted for television . For the show " Death Valley Days " , the production crew was able to reuse Santa Fe locomotive number 1010 , the 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 locomotive that was used in the original run between Needles and Seligman ( and the only unit still on Santa Fe 's active roster ) . Robert <unk> , a fireman on the original Scott Special , was on hand to aid in the recreation as the replica train worked over Cajon Pass in California . In October 1984 , the Santa Fe donated locomotive 1010 to the California State Railroad Museum , where it remains on static display . 
 The 100th anniversary of the Scott Special was commemorated with localized events and interpretive displays along the train 's route sponsored by various historical organizations . One such display was shown at Joliet , Illinois , by the Blackhawk Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society ; the Scott Special passed Joliet just after 11 : 00 am on July 11 , 1905 . 
 Amtrak 's daily Southwest Chief follows nearly the same route as the Scott Special . As of 2006 , the Southwest Chief makes the journey in just under 43 hours , departing Los Angeles Union Station at 6 : 45 pm Pacific Time , and scheduled to arrive at Chicago Union Station at 3 : 20 pm Central Time on the second day of the trip .

 Benjamin " Bennie " Oosterbaan ( February 4 , 1906 – October 25 , 1990 ) was a three @-@ time first team All @-@ American football end for the Michigan Wolverines football team , two @-@ time All @-@ American basketball player for the basketball team , and an All @-@ Big Ten Conference baseball player for the baseball team . He is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players in Michigan history . He was selected by Sports Illustrated as the fourth greatest athlete in the history of the U.S. state of Michigan in 2003 and one of the eleven greatest college football players of the first century of the game ( ending in 1968 ) . 
 During his collegiate athletic career he was a Big Ten batting champion in baseball , Big Ten scoring champion in basketball , and Big Ten touchdown leader in football . He was the first University of Michigan athlete to become a first @-@ team All @-@ American in basketball and the first three @-@ time first @-@ team football All @-@ American . In high school , he had been an All @-@ American basketball player , a state champion in track and field , and an All @-@ state player in baseball and football . In addition to his All @-@ American collegiate performances as an end , Oosterbaan threw three touchdown passes in the dedication game of Michigan Stadium . 
 After his playing career ended , Oosterbaan spent several decades working for the University of Michigan Athletic Department until the 1970s . Oosterbaan served as the football , basketball , and baseball coach for the University . Oosterbaan 's 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team won an Associated Press national championship , and his 1950 squad won the 1951 Rose Bowl . He later served as the director of athletic alumni relations . 
 = = Athletic career = = 
 Born in Muskegon , Michigan , Oosterbaan began his athletic career at Muskegon High School where he was selected by the Detroit News as an All @-@ State end . In his junior year ( 1923 ) , he led the Muskegon basketball team to a state championship and was named a High School All @-@ American in basketball . He was also an All @-@ State baseball player and state champion discus thrower . According to a Michigan Today article , he probably could have made the 1928 Summer Olympics team in the discus . 
 At Michigan , Bennie Oosterbaan earned nine letters — three apiece in football , basketball , and baseball . In its obituary of Oosterbaan , The Sporting News described him as a phenomenal student @-@ athlete who in his senior year at Michigan " was captain of the football team , led the Big Ten Conference in scoring in basketball and was the league 's leading hitter in baseball , a sport he had not pursued while in high school . " 
 Oosterbaan was both a scholar and an athlete . In 1928 , he was awarded the Western Conference Medal of Honor for proficiency as a scholar @-@ athlete . That season he was captain , most valuable player , and an All @-@ American in football ; Big Ten scoring champion and All @-@ American in basketball ; and Big Ten batting average champion in what may be the most dominant three sport performance in any conference in a single year . 
 = = = Football = = = 
 After a year on the freshmen football team , he was invited to varsity tryouts . A star receiver and defensive end in a time when the forward pass was still evolving , Oosterbaan united with quarterback Benny Friedman as a passing combination . As a sophomore in 1925 , Oosterbaan led the Big Ten with eight touchdowns . That year , the Wolverines outscored their opponents 227 – 3 . The team shut out every team they faced , except a 3 – 2 defeat to Northwestern at Soldier Field late in the season . Oosterbaan 's defensive play was outstanding as well , and he was key in shutting out the Fighting Illini and Red Grange 3 – 0 in 1925 a year after he scored four touchdowns in the first twelve minutes . Five players from the 1925 team were named All @-@ Americans , including Benny Friedman and Oosterbaan . He was briefly kicked off of the team during the year by an assistant coach for lining up incorrectly before coach Fielding H. Yost brought him back . 
 In 1926 , Friedman and Oosterbaan were both named All @-@ Americans after leading the Wolverines to a 7 – 1 record and their second consecutive Big Ten Conference championship . That year , his 60 @-@ yard run with a recovered fumble helped Michigan to a 7 – 6 victory over Minnesota in the annual Little Brown Jug game . The Wolverines outscored their opponents , 191 – 38 , and suffered their only loss to Navy , 10 – 0 , in front of 80 @,@ 000 fans at Baltimore Stadium . 
 The following year , Friedman had moved on to the NFL , and Oosterbaan was named the team 's captain and Most Valuable Player . Oosterbaan was a skilled passer , once throwing for three touchdowns passes in the Michigan Stadium dedication game against rival Ohio State University on October 22 , 1927 . Oosterbaan was also selected as an All @-@ American for the third consecutive season . He is one of only two players at Michigan ever to receive consensus All @-@ American honors three times — Anthony Carter being the other . The Wolverines went 20 – 4 in Oosterbaan 's career at Michigan .

 = = Coaching career = = 
 After graduating , Oosterbaan declined offers to play professional football and baseball . According to friend and player Ron Kramer , Oosterbaan grew up in the Dutch Reformed Church and did not sign a professional football or baseball contract " because of his religious background and his mother . Dutch Reformed didn 't play football on Sundays . " 
 Instead , Oosterbaan stayed on at the University of Michigan as an assistant coach for the football and basketball teams . He began as an assistant football coach immediately after graduating , and he remained an assistant coach of the football team for twenty years before succeeding Fritz Crisler . After serving 10 seasons as an assistant coach , he also became the head basketball coach in 1938 and served in that capacity until 1946 . The basketball team had an 81 – 72 record while Oosterbaan was the head coach . Oosterbaan employed an uptempo style of play that differed from that of his predecessor Franklin Cappon . Oosterbaan was also head coach of the freshman baseball team . 
 In 1948 , Oosterbaan took over as head coach of the football team at Michigan . Crisler named Oosterbaan as his successor after the 1948 Rose Bowl in which Michigan beat the USC Trojans by a score of 49 – 0 . Crisler described Oosterbaan as " the best offensive mind in college football . " Oosterbaan led the Wolverines to an Associated Press ( AP ) national championship in his first season and won Coach of the Year honors . His 1950 team won the 1951 Rose Bowl after Oosterbaan obtained consent from the Conference to hold extra practices . His teams won Big Ten championships in each of his first three seasons but did not win another under his tenure . He coached at Michigan until 1958 , compiling a 63 – 33 – 4 record . 
 Oosterbaan believed success was fleeting . He once was quoted in Time Magazine as saying , " I 'm on top now , and there is a lot of <unk> . But what of seasons to come ? Let me lose the opener or a couple of other games next fall , and then watch how I 'm blasted . " As coach , he had a reputation as a mild @-@ mannered man who aspired to live by the maxims of his own college football coach , Fielding Yost . 
 Oosterbaan had an mild @-@ mannered coaching style . " <unk> " was his favorite word when it came to inspiring his team . He coached without using a lot of yelling and screaming . Oosterbaan motivated his players without using sarcasm or losing his temper , and rarely used locker room pep talks . 
 Oosterbaan resigned as the head football coach in 1958 . At the time , he said : " The pressure finally got to me . Not the kind that comes from outside . Not from my bosses or the fans . I mean the pressure that builds up inside a head coach whether he wins or loses . " After Oosterbaan quit as football coach he was succeeded by Bump Elliott . In 1959 , Oosterbaan became Michigan 's director of athletic alumni relations and held that position until he retired in 1972 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Oosterbaan died in 1990 , having spent his entire career associated with the University of Michigan . As one of his obituaries noted , he " went to Ann Arbor as a freshman in 1924 — and never left . " All @-@ American Ron Kramer said of his former coach : " Bennie Oosterbaan is the Michigan tradition . The man gave his whole life to Michigan . " When he died he was the most recent Michigan football coach to have a team ranked # 1 in the nation at the end of the season . 
 Oosterbaan 's wife of 57 years , Delmas , had predeceased him a few months earlier on July 23 . He was survived by his sister , Grace <unk> ; his daughter , Anna Wilson ; and two grandsons . Two of his brothers , Guy and Andy , died when Oosterbaan was a young man . Oosterbaan is no relation to John Paul Oosterbaan who was a member of the 1989 NCAA Championship basketball team . While at the University of Michigan he was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity . 
 Don Lund , Michigan 's associate athletic director for alumni relations who also played basketball for Oosterbaan said : " There 's no question he was the greatest athlete we ever had here at Michigan . " Ohio State Buckeyes football coach Woody Hayes once said of Oosterbaan : " If he weren 't from Michigan , I 'd like to have my own son play for him . "

 Bennie Oosterbaan 's jersey number 47 was the first Michigan football jersey number retired , and until 2011 , it was one of only five numbers retired by the Michigan football program . In 2012 , the Michigan Football Legends program led to the reissue of the No. 47 jersey to linebacker Jake Ryan , bearing a patch ( pictured at right ) honoring Oosterbaan . Each player to wear the jersey will also dress at a locker bearing a plaque with Oosterbaan 's name and his time of tenure at Michigan . 
 In 1954 , he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame . He was a member of the fourth class of inductees into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1958 . Oosterbaan was a member of the inaugural 1978 class of inductees into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor . The Michigan football indoor practice facility was named Oosterbaan Field House . In 2000 , he was selected to the Michigan All @-@ Century team . 
 American sports @-@ writer , Grantland Rice selected him and Don Hutson as the ends for the all @-@ time All @-@ American team of the first half of the 20th century .

 In 1999 , Sports Illustrated published a list of " The 50 Greatest Sports Figures From Michigan " ( in all sports ) , and ranked Oosterbaan fourth on the list behind Joe Louis , Magic Johnson and Charlie Gehringer . He was the highest ranked football player , ahead of Michigan Wolverines Ron Kramer ( # 7 ) , Fielding H. Yost ( # 9 ) , Rick Leach ( # 22 ) , Fritz Crisler ( # 31 ) , and Harry Kipke ( # 40 ) .

 = Sleep hygiene = 
 Sleep hygiene is the recommended behavioral and environmental practice that is intended to promote better quality sleep . This recommendation was developed in the late 1970s as a method to help people with mild to moderate insomnia , but , as of 2014 , the evidence for effectiveness of individual recommendations is " limited and inconclusive " . Clinicians assess the sleep hygiene of people who present with insomnia and other conditions , such as depression , and offer recommendations based on the assessment . Sleep hygiene recommendations include establishing a regular sleep schedule , using naps with care , not exercising physically or mentally too close to bedtime , limiting worry , limiting exposure to light in the hours before sleep , getting out of bed if sleep does not come , not using bed for anything but sleep and sex , avoiding alcohol as well as nicotine , caffeine , and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime , and having a peaceful , comfortable and dark sleep environment . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 Practice of sleep hygiene and knowledge of sleep hygiene practices can be assessed with measures such as the Sleep Hygiene Index , Sleep Hygiene Awareness and Practice Scale , or the Sleep Hygiene Self @-@ Test . For younger individuals , sleep hygiene can be assessed by the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale or the Children 's Sleep Hygiene Scale . 
 = = Recommendations = = 
 Clinicians choose among recommendations for improving sleep quality for each individual and counselling is presented as a form of patient education . 
 = = = Sleep schedule = = = 
 One set of recommendations relates to the timing of sleep . For adults , getting less than 7 – 8 hours of sleep is associated with a number of physical and mental health deficits , and therefore a top sleep hygiene recommendation is allowing enough time for sleep . Clinicians will frequently advise that these hours of sleep are obtained at night instead of through napping , because while naps can be helpful after sleep deprivation , under normal conditions naps may be detrimental to nighttime sleep . Negative effects of napping on sleep and performance have been found to depend on duration and timing , with shorter midday naps being the least disruptive . There is also focus on the importance of awakening around the same time every morning and generally having a regular sleep schedule . 
 = = = Activities = = = 
 Exercise is an activity that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality ; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep than those who do not , but exercising too late in the day can be activating and delay falling asleep . Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep @-@ wake schedule aligned with nature 's daily light @-@ dark cycle . 
 Activities that reduce physiological arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep , so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended . Conversely , continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed has been shown to delay falling asleep . Similarly , good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime . Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep , so in such situations a person may be advised to get out of bed and try something else for a brief amount of time . 
 Generally , for people experiencing difficulties with sleep , spending less time in bed results in deeper and more continuous sleep , so clinicians will frequently recommend eliminating use of the bed for any activities except sleep ( or sex ) . 
 = = = Foods and substances = = = 
 A number of foods and substances have been found to disturb sleep , due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands . Avoiding nicotine , caffeine ( including coffee , energy drinks , soft drinks , tea , chocolate , and some pain relievers ) , and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists , as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness . Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians , because , although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially , the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep . Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one 's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep , leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness . Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime , requiring effort to metabolize it all , and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep ; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime . Lastly , limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to <unk> . 
 = = = Sleep environment = = = 
 Arranging a sleep environment that is quiet , very dark , and cool is recommended . Noises , light , and uncomfortable temperatures have been shown to disrupt continuous sleep . Other recommendations that are frequently made , though less studied , include selecting comfortable mattresses , bedding , and pillows , and eliminating a visible bedroom clock , to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep . 
 In 2015 , a systematic review of studies on mattresses concluded that medium @-@ firm , custom @-@ inflated mattresses were best for pain and neutral spinal alignment . 
 = = Effectiveness = = 
 Sleep hygiene studies use different sets of sleep hygiene recommendations , and the evidence that improving sleep hygiene improves sleep quality is weak and inconclusive as of 2014 . Most research on sleep hygiene principles has been conducted in clinical settings , and there is a need for more research on non @-@ clinical populations . 
 The strength of research support for each recommendation varies ; some of the more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments , alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep , engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep , and trying too hard to fall asleep . There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations , including getting a more comfortable mattress , removing bedroom clocks , not worrying , and limiting liquids . Other recommendations , such as the effects of napping or exercise , have a more complicated evidence base . The effects of napping , for example , seem to depend on the length and timing of napping , in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights . 
 There is support showing positive sleep outcomes for people who follow more than one sleep hygiene recommendation . 
 While there is inconclusive evidence that sleep hygiene alone is effective as a treatment for insomnia , some research studies have shown improvement in insomnia for patients who receive sleep hygiene education in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy practices . 
 = = Special populations = = 
 Sleep hygiene is a central component of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia . Sleep hygiene recommendations have been shown to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of insomnia . Specific sleep disorders may require other or additional treatment approaches , and continuing difficulties with sleep may require additional assistance from healthcare providers . 
 College students are at risk of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation . Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment , college students may be likely to have variable sleep @-@ wake schedules across the week , take naps , drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime , and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments . Because of this , it is important to have sleep hygiene education on college campuses . 
 Similarly , shift workers have difficulty maintaining a healthy sleep @-@ wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours . Shift workers need to be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine , as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety , but should be timed carefully . Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake , additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping . 
 Due to symptoms of low mood and energy , individuals with depression may be likely to have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene , such as taking naps during the day , consuming alcohol near bedtime , and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day . In addition to sleep hygiene education , bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression . Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep @-@ wake schedule , but it also has been shown to be effective for treating depression directly , especially when related to seasonal affective disorder . 
 Individuals with breathing difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep that can be addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations . Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep , reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep . For individuals with allergies or asthma , additional considerations must be given to potential triggers in the bedroom environment . Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways , so there must be careful management of decongestants , asthma controllers , and antihistamines . 
 = = Implementation = = 
 Sleep hygiene strategies include advice about timing of sleep and food intake in relationship to exercise and sleeping environment . Recommendations depend on knowledge of the individual situation ; counselling is presented as a form of patient education . 
 As attention to the role of sleep hygiene in promoting public health has grown , there has been an increase in the number of resources available in print and on the internet . Organizations running public health initiatives include the National Sleep Foundation and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School , both of which have created public websites with sleep hygiene resources , such as tips for sleep hygiene , instructional videos , sleep hygiene self @-@ assessments , poll statistics on sleep hygiene , and tools to find sleep professionals . A cooperative agreement between the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project , with one of their aims being to promote sleep hygiene awareness . 
 = = History = = 
 While the term sleep hygiene was first introduced in 1939 by Nathaniel <unk> , a book published in 1977 by psychologist Peter Hauri introduced the concept within the context of modern sleep medicine . In this book Hauri outlined a list of behavioral rules intended to promote improved sleep . Similar concepts are credited to Paolo <unk> who published a related original book in 1864 . The 1990 publication of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders ( ICSD ) introduced the diagnostic category Inadequate Sleep Hygiene . Inadequate sleep hygiene was a subclassification of Chronic Insomnia Disorder in the ICSD @-@ II published in 2005 ; it was removed from the 2014 ICSD @-@ III along with two other classifications , because " they were not felt to be reliably reproducible in clinical practice . " 
 Specific sleep hygiene recommendations have changed over time . For example , advice to simply avoid sleeping pills was included in early sets of recommendations , but as more drugs to help with sleep have been introduced , recommendations concerning their use have become more complex . 
 = Tony Bennett = 
 Anthony Dominick Benedetto ( born August 3 , 1926 ) , known professionally by his stage name Tony Bennett , is an American singer of traditional pop standards , big band , show tunes , and jazz . He is also a painter , having created works under the name Anthony Benedetto that are on permanent public display in several institutions . He is the founder of the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria , Queens , New York . 
 Born and raised in Astoria to an Italian @-@ American family , Bennett began singing at an early age . He fought in the final stages of World War II as a U.S. Army infantryman in the European Theater . Afterward , he developed his singing technique , signed with Columbia Records and had his first number @-@ one popular song with " Because of You " in 1951 . Several top hits such as " Rags to Riches " followed in the early 1950s . He then refined his approach to encompass jazz singing . He reached an artistic peak in the late 1950s with albums such as The Beat of My Heart and Basie Swings , Bennett Sings . In 1962 , Bennett recorded his signature song , " I Left My Heart in San Francisco " . His career and his personal life experienced an extended downturn during the height of the rock music era . 
 Bennett staged a comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s , putting out gold record albums again and expanding his reach to the MTV Generation while keeping his musical style intact . He has won 19 Grammy Awards ( including a Lifetime Achievement Award , presented in 2001 ) and two Emmy Awards , and was named an NEA Jazz Master and a Kennedy Center Honoree . He has sold over 50 million records worldwide .

 Anthony Dominick Benedetto was born on August 3 , 1926 , in Astoria , Queens , New York , to grocer John Benedetto and seamstress Anna <unk> . In 1906 , John had emigrated from <unk> , a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria . Anna had been born in the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899 . Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America . Tony grew up with an older sister , Mary , and an older brother , John Jr . With a father who was ailing and unable to work , the children grew up in poverty . John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature and a compassion for human suffering , but died when Tony was 10 years old . The experience of growing up in the Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat . 
 Young Tony grew up listening to Al Jolson , Eddie Cantor , Judy Garland , and Bing Crosby as well as jazz artists such as Louis Armstrong , Jack <unk> , and Joe Venuti . His Uncle Dick was a tap dancer in vaudeville , giving him an early window into show business , and his Uncle Frank was the Queens borough library commissioner . By age 10 he was already singing , and performed at the opening of the Triborough Bridge , standing next to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia who patted him on the head . Drawing was another early passion of his ; he became known as the class caricaturist at P.S. 141 and anticipated a career in commercial art . He began singing for money at age 13 , performing as a singing waiter in several Italian restaurants around his native Queens . 
 He attended New York 's School of Industrial Art where he studied painting and music and would later appreciate their emphasis on proper technique . But he dropped out at age 16 to help support his family . He worked as a copy boy and runner for the Associated Press in Manhattan and in several other low @-@ skilled , low @-@ paying jobs . However , he mostly set his sights on a professional singing career , returning to performing as a singing waiter , playing and winning amateur nights all around the city , and having a successful engagement at a Paramus , New Jersey , nightclub . 
 = = = 1944 – 50 : World War II and after = = = 
 Benedetto was drafted into the United States Army in November 1944 , during the final stages of World War II . He did basic training at Fort Dix and Fort Robinson as part of becoming an infantry rifleman . Benedetto ran afoul of a sergeant from the South who disliked the Italian from New York City and heavy doses of KP duty or BAR cleaning resulted . Processed through the huge Le Havre replacement depot , in January 1945 , he was assigned as a replacement infantryman to the 255th Infantry Regiment of the 63rd Infantry Division , a unit filling in for the heavy losses suffered in the Battle of the Bulge . He moved across France , and later , into Germany . As March 1945 began , he joined the front line and what he would later describe as a " front @-@ row seat in hell . " 
 As the German Army was pushed back to its homeland , Benedetto and his company saw bitter fighting in cold winter conditions , often <unk> down in foxholes as German 88 mm guns fired on them . At the end of March , they crossed the Rhine and entered Germany , engaging in dangerous house @-@ to @-@ house , town @-@ after @-@ town fighting to clean out German soldiers ; during the first week of April , they crossed the Kocher River , and by the end of the month reached the Danube . During his time in combat , Benedetto narrowly escaped death several times . The experience made him a pacifist ; he would later write , " Anybody who thinks that war is romantic obviously hasn 't gone through one , " and later say , " It was a nightmare that 's permanent . I just said , ' This is not life . This is not life . ' " At the war 's conclusion he was involved in the liberation of a Nazi concentration camp near Landsberg , where some American prisoners of war from the 63rd Division had also been held . 
 Benedetto stayed in Germany as part of the occupying force , but was assigned to an informal Special Services band unit that would entertain nearby American forces . His dining with a black friend from high school – at a time when the Army was still racially segregated – led to his being demoted and reassigned to Graves Registration Service duties . Subsequently , he sang with the 314th Army Special Services Band under the stage name Joe Bari ( a name he had started using before the war , chosen after the city and province in Italy and as a partial anagram of his family origins in Calabria ) . He played with many musicians who would have post @-@ war careers . 
 Upon his discharge from the Army and return to the States in 1946 , Benedetto studied at the American Theatre Wing on the GI Bill . He was taught the bel canto singing discipline , which would keep his voice in good shape for his entire career . He continued to perform wherever he could , including while waiting tables . Based upon a suggestion from a teacher at American Theatre Wing , he developed an unusual approach that involved imitating , as he sang , the style and phrasing of other musicians — such as that of Stan Getz 's saxophone and Art Tatum 's piano — helping him to improvise as he interpreted a song . He made a few recordings as Bari in 1949 for small Leslie Records , but they failed to sell . 
 In 1949 , Pearl Bailey recognized Benedetto 's talent and asked him to open for her in Greenwich Village . She had invited Bob Hope to the show . Hope decided to take Benedetto on the road with him , and simplified his name to Tony Bennett . In 1950 , Bennett cut a demo of " Boulevard of Broken Dreams " and was signed to the major Columbia Records label by Mitch Miller . 
 = = = 1951 – 59 : First successes = = = 
 Warned by Miller not to imitate Frank Sinatra ( who was just then leaving Columbia ) , Bennett began his career as a crooner of commercial pop tunes . His first big hit was " Because of You " , a ballad produced by Miller with a lush orchestral arrangement from Percy Faith . It started out gaining popularity on jukeboxes , then reached number one on the pop charts in 1951 and stayed there for ten weeks , selling over a million copies . This was followed to the top of the charts later that year by a similarly @-@ styled rendition of Hank Williams 's " Cold , Cold Heart " , which helped introduce Williams and country music in general to a wider , more national audience . The Miller and Faith tandem continued to work on all of Bennett 's early hits . Bennett 's recording of " Blue Velvet " was also very popular and attracted screaming teenaged fans at concerts at the famed Paramount Theater in New York ( Bennett did seven shows a day , starting at 10 : 30 a.m. ) and elsewhere . 
 On February 12 , 1952 , Bennett married Ohio art student and jazz fan Patricia Beech , whom he had met the previous year after a nightclub performance in Cleveland . Two thousand female fans dressed in black gathered outside the ceremony at St. Patrick 's Cathedral in Manhattan , New York , in mock mourning . The couple had two sons , D 'Andrea ( Danny , born 1954 ) and <unk> ( Dae , born 1955 ) . 
 A third number @-@ one came in 1953 with " Rags to Riches " . Unlike Bennett 's other early hits , this was an up @-@ tempo big band number with a bold , brassy sound and a double tango in the instrumental break ; it topped the charts for eight weeks . Later that year , the producers of the upcoming Broadway musical Kismet had Bennett record " Stranger in Paradise " as a way of promoting the show during a New York newspaper strike . The song reached the top , the show was a hit , and Bennett began a long practice of recording show tunes . " Stranger in Paradise " was also a number @-@ one hit in the United Kingdom a year and a half later and started Bennett 's career as an international artist . 
 Once the rock and roll era began in 1955 , the dynamic of the music industry changed and it became harder and harder for existing pop singers to do well commercially . Nevertheless , Bennett continued to enjoy success , placing eight songs in the Billboard Top 40 during the latter part of the 1950s , with " In the Middle of an Island " reaching the highest at number nine in 1957 . 
 For a month in August – September 1956 , Bennett hosted a NBC Saturday night television variety show , The Tony Bennett Show , as a summer replacement for The Perry Como Show . Patti Page and Julius La Rosa had in turn hosted the two previous months , and they all shared the same singers , dancers , and orchestra . In 1959 , Bennett would again fill in for The Perry Como Show , this time alongside Teresa Brewer and Jaye P. Morgan as co @-@ hosts of the summer @-@ long Perry Presents . 
 = = = 1954 – 65 : A growing artistry = = = 
 In 1954 , the guitarist Chuck Wayne became Bennett 's musical director . Bennett released his first long @-@ playing album in 1955 , Cloud 7 . The album was billed as featuring Wayne and showed Bennett 's leanings towards jazz . In 1957 , Ralph Sharon became Bennett 's pianist , arranger , and musical director , replacing Wayne . Sharon told Bennett that a career singing " sweet saccharine songs like ' Blue Velvet ' " wouldn 't last long , and encouraged Bennett to focus even more on his jazz inclinations . 
 The result was the 1957 album The Beat of My Heart . It used well @-@ known jazz musicians such as Herbie Mann and Nat Adderley , with a strong emphasis on percussion from the likes of Art Blakey , Jo Jones , Latin star Candido <unk> , and Chico Hamilton . The album was both popular and critically praised . Bennett followed this by working with the Count Basie Orchestra , becoming the first male pop vocalist to sing with Basie 's band . The albums Basie Swings , Bennett Sings ( 1958 ) and In Person ! ( 1959 ) were the well @-@ regarded fruits of this collaboration , with " Chicago " being one of the standout songs . 
 Bennett also built up the quality , and therefore , the reputation of his nightclub act ; in this he was following the path of Sinatra and other top jazz and standards singers of this era . In June 1962 , Bennett staged a highly promoted concert performance at Carnegie Hall , using a stellar line @-@ up of musicians including Al Cohn , Kenny Burrell , and Candido , as well as the Ralph Sharon Trio . The concert featured 44 songs , including favorites like " I 've Got the World on a String " and " The Best Is Yet To Come " . It was a big success , further cementing Bennett 's reputation as a star both at home and abroad . Bennett also appeared on television , and in October 1962 he sang on the initial broadcast of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson . 
 Also in 1962 , Bennett released his recording of " I Left My Heart in San Francisco " , a decade @-@ old but little @-@ known song originally written for an opera singer . Although this reached only number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 , it spent close to a year on various other charts and increased Bennett 's exposure . The album of the same title was a top 5 hit and both the single and album achieved gold record status . The song won Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Male Solo Vocal Performance . Over the years , this would become known as Bennett 's signature song . In 2001 , it was ranked 23rd on an RIAA / NEA list of the most historically significant Songs of the 20th Century . 
 Bennett 's following album , I Wanna Be Around ... ( 1963 ) , was also a top @-@ 5 success , with the title track and " The Good Life " each reaching the top 20 of the pop singles chart along with the top 10 of the Adult Contemporary chart . 
 The next year brought the Beatles and the British Invasion , and with them still more musical and cultural attention to rock and less to pop , standards , and jazz . Over the next couple of years , Bennett had minor hits with several albums and singles based on show tunes ; his last top @-@ 40 single was the number 34 " If I Ruled the World " from Pickwick in 1965 , but his commercial fortunes were clearly starting to decline . An attempt to break into acting with a role in the poorly received 1966 film The Oscar met with middling reviews for Bennett ; he did not enjoy the experience and did not seek further roles . 
 A firm believer in the American Civil Rights movement , Bennett participated in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches . Years later he would continue this commitment by refusing to perform in apartheid South Africa . 
 = = = 1965 – 79 : Years of struggle = = = 
 Ralph Sharon and Bennett parted ways in 1965 . There was great pressure on singers such as Lena Horne and Barbra Streisand to record " contemporary " rock songs , and in this vein , Columbia Records ' Clive Davis suggested that Bennett do the same . Bennett was very reluctant , and when he tried , the results pleased no one . This was exemplified by Tony Sings the Great Hits of Today ! ( 1970 ) , before which Bennett became physically ill at the thought of recording . It featured misguided attempts at Beatles and other current songs and a ludicrous psychedelic art cover . 
 Years later , Bennett would recall his dismay at being asked to do contemporary material , comparing it to when his mother was forced to produce a cheap dress . By 1972 , he had departed Columbia for the Verve division of MGM Records ( Philips in the UK ) and had relocated for a stint in London , where he hosted a television show from the Talk of the Town nightclub in conjunction with Thames Television , Tony Bennett from the Talk of the Town . With his new label , he tried a variety of approaches , including some more Beatles material , but found no renewed commercial success , and in a couple more years he was without a recording contract . 
 Bennett and his wife Patricia had been separated since 1965 , their marriage a victim of Bennett 's spending too much time on the road , among other factors . In 1969 , Patricia sued him for divorce on grounds of adultery . In 1971 , their divorce became official . Bennett had become involved with aspiring actress Sandra Grant while filming The Oscar in 1965 ; the couple lived together for several years , and on December 29 , 1971 , they quietly married in New York . They had two daughters , Joanna ( born 1970 ) and Antonia ( born 1974 ) , and moved to Los Angeles . 
 Taking matters into his own hands , Bennett started his own record company , Improv . He cut some songs that would later become favorites , such as " What is This Thing Called Love ? " , and made two well @-@ regarded albums with jazz pianist Bill Evans , The Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Album ( 1975 ) and Together Again ( 1976 ) , but Improv lacked a distribution arrangement with a major label and by 1977 , it was out of business . 
 As the decade neared its end , Bennett had no recording contract , no manager , and was not performing many concerts outside of Las Vegas . His second marriage was failing ( they would completely separate in 1979 and the marriage was dissolved by court order on July 1 , 1983 ) . He had developed a drug addiction , was living beyond his means , and had the Internal Revenue Service trying to seize his Los Angeles home . 
 = = = 1979 – 89 : Turnaround = = = 
 After a near @-@ fatal cocaine overdose in 1979 , Bennett called his sons Danny and Dae for help . " Look , I 'm lost here , " he told them . " It seems like people don 't want to hear the music I make . " 
 Danny Bennett , an aspiring musician himself , also came to a realization . The band Danny and his brother had started , <unk> Duck and His Barnyard Friends , had foundered and Danny 's musical abilities were limited . However , he had discovered during this time that he did have a head for business . His father , on the other hand , had tremendous musical talent , but was having trouble sustaining a career from it and had little financial sense . Danny signed on as his father 's manager . 
 Danny got his father 's expenses under control , moved him back to New York , and began booking him in colleges and small theaters to get him away from a " Vegas " image . After some effort , a successful plan to pay back the IRS debt was put into place . The singer had also reunited with Ralph Sharon as his pianist and musical director ( and would remain with him until Sharon 's retirement in 2002 ) . By 1986 , Tony Bennett was re @-@ signed to Columbia Records , this time with creative control , and released The Art of Excellence . This became his first album to reach the charts since 1972 . 
 = = = 1990 – 95 : An unexpected audience = = = 
 Danny Bennett felt that younger audiences who were unfamiliar with his father would respond to his music if given a chance . No changes to Tony 's formal appearance , singing style , musical accompaniment ( The Ralph Sharon Trio or an orchestra ) , or song choice ( generally the Great American Songbook ) were necessary or desirable . Accordingly , Danny began regularly to book his father on Late Night with David Letterman , a show with a younger , " hip " audience . This was subsequently followed by appearances on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien , The Simpsons , Muppets Tonight , and various MTV programs . In 1993 , Bennett played a series of benefit concerts organized by alternative rock radio stations around the country . The plan worked ; as Tony later remembered , " I realized that young people had never heard those songs . Cole Porter , Gershwin – they were like , ' Who wrote that ? ' To them , it was different . If you 're different , you stand out . " 
 During this time , Bennett continued to record , first putting out the acclaimed look @-@ back Astoria : Portrait of the Artist ( 1990 ) , then emphasizing themed albums such as the Sinatra homage Perfectly Frank ( 1992 ) and the Fred Astaire tribute Steppin ' Out ( 1993 ) . The latter two both achieved gold status and won Grammys for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance ( Bennett 's first Grammys since 1962 ) and further established Bennett as the inheritor of the mantle of a classic American great . 
 As Bennett was seen at MTV Video Music Awards shows side @-@ by @-@ side with the likes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Flavor Flav , and as his " Steppin ' Out with My Baby " video received MTV airplay , it was clear that , as The New York Times said , " Tony Bennett has not just bridged the generation gap , he has demolished it . He has solidly connected with a younger crowd weaned on rock . And there have been no compromises . " 
 The new audience reached its height with Bennett 's appearance in 1994 on MTV Unplugged . ( He quipped on the show , " I 've been unplugged my whole career . " ) Featuring guest appearances by rock and country stars Elvis Costello and k.d. lang ( both of whom had an affinity for the standards genre ) , the show attracted a considerable audience and much media attention . The resulting MTV Unplugged : Tony Bennett album went platinum and , besides taking the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance Grammy award for the third straight year , also won the top Grammy prize of Album of the Year . 
 = = = 1996 – present : No retirement = = = 
 Since his comeback , Bennett has financially prospered ; by 1999 , his assets were worth $ 15 to 20 million . He had no intention of retiring , saying in reference to masters such as Pablo Picasso , Jack Benny , and Fred Astaire : " right up to the day they died , they were performing . If you are creative , you get busier as you get older . " Bennett continued to record and tour steadily , doing a hundred shows a year by the end of the 1990s . In concert Bennett often makes a point of singing one song ( usually " Fly Me to the Moon " ) without any microphone or amplification , demonstrating his skills at vocal projection . One show , Tony Bennett 's Wonderful World : Live From San Francisco , was made into a PBS special . Bennett also created the idea behind , and starred in the first episode of , the A & E Network 's popular Live by Request series , for which he won an Emmy Award . In addition to numerous television guest performances , Bennett has had cameo appearances as himself in films such as The Scout , Analyze This , and Bruce Almighty . 
 In 1998 he made an unlikely but successful appearance at a mud @-@ soaked Glastonbury in an immaculate suit and tie . Bennett also published The Good Life : The Autobiography of Tony Bennett in 1998 . A series of albums , often based on themes ( such as Duke Ellington , Louis Armstrong , Billie Holiday , blues , or duets ) , has met with good acceptance ; Bennett has won eleven more Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance or Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammys in the subsequent years , most recently for the year 2016 . Bennett has sold over 50 million records worldwide during his career . 
 Accolades came to Bennett . For his contribution to the recording industry , Tony Bennett was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street . Bennett was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 , was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001 , and received a lifetime achievement award from the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) in 2002 . In 2002 , Q magazine named Tony Bennett in its list of the " 50 Bands To See Before You Die " . On December 4 , 2005 , Bennett was the recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor . Later , a theatrical musical revue of his songs , called I Left My Heart : A Salute to the Music of Tony Bennett was created and featured some of his best @-@ known songs such as " I Left My Heart in San Francisco " , " Because of You " , and " Wonderful " . The following year , Bennett was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame . 
 Bennett frequently donates his time to charitable causes , to the extent that he is sometimes nicknamed " Tony Benefit " . In April 2002 , he joined Michael Jackson , Chris Tucker and former President Bill Clinton in a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee at New York 's Apollo Theater . He has also recorded public service announcements for Civitan International . 
 In the late 1980s , Bennett entered into a long @-@ term romantic relationship with Susan Crow , a former New York City schoolteacher who was 40 years his junior . Bennett and Crow founded Exploring the Arts , a charitable organization dedicated to creating , promoting , and supporting arts education . At the same time they founded ( and named after Bennett 's friend ) the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Queens , a public high school dedicated to teaching the performing arts , which opened in 2001 and would have a very high graduation rate . On June 21 , 2007 , Bennett married Crow in a private civil ceremony in New York that was witnessed by former Governor Mario Cuomo . 
 Danny Bennett continues to be Tony 's manager while Dae Bennett is a recording engineer who has worked on a number of Tony 's projects and who has opened Bennett Studios in Englewood , New Jersey . Tony 's younger daughter Antonia is an aspiring jazz singer . 
 In August 2006 , Bennett turned eighty years old . The birthday itself was an occasion for publicity , which then extended through the rest of the following year . Duets : An American Classic reached the highest place ever on the albums chart for an album by Bennett and garnered two Grammy Awards ; concerts were given , including a high @-@ profile one for New York radio station <unk> @-@ FM ; a performance was done with Christina Aguilera and a comedy sketch was made with affectionate Bennett impressionist Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live ; a Thanksgiving @-@ time , Rob Marshall @-@ directed television special Tony Bennett : An American Classic on NBC , which would win multiple Emmy Awards ; receipt of the Billboard Century Award ; and guest @-@ mentoring on American Idol season 6 as well as performing during its finale . He received the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ' Humanitarian Award . Bennett was awarded the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Award in 2006 , the highest honor that the United States bestows upon jazz musicians . 
 The year 2008 saw Bennett making two appearances on " New York State of Mind " with Billy Joel at the final concerts given at Shea Stadium , and in October releasing the album A Swingin ' Christmas with The Count Basie Big Band , for which he made a number of promotional appearances at holiday time . In 2009 , Bennett performed at the conclusion of the final Macworld Conference & Expo for Apple Inc . , singing the " The Best Is Yet to Come " and " I Left My Heart In San Francisco " to a standing ovation , and later making his Jazz Fest debut in New Orleans . In February 2010 , Bennett was one of over 70 artists singing on " We Are the World 25 for Haiti " , a charity single in aid of the 2010 Haiti earthquake . In October he performed " I Left My Heart in San Francisco " at AT & T Park before the third inning of Game 1 of the 2010 World Series and sang " God Bless America " during the seventh @-@ inning stretch . Days later he sang " America the Beautiful " at the Rally to Restore Sanity and / or Fear in Washington , D.C. 
 In September 2011 , Bennett appeared on The Howard Stern Show and named American military actions in the Middle East as the root cause of the September 11 attacks . Bennett also claimed that former President George W. Bush personally told him at the Kennedy Center in December 2005 that he felt he had made a mistake invading Iraq , to which a Bush spokesperson replied , " This account is flatly wrong . " Following bad press resulting from his remarks , Bennett clarified his position , writing : " There is simply no excuse for terrorism and the murder of the nearly 3 @,@ 000 innocent victims of the 9 / 11 attacks on our country . My life experiences , ranging from the Battle of the Bulge to marching with Martin Luther King , made me a life @-@ long humanist and pacifist , and reinforced my belief that violence begets violence and that war is the lowest form of human behavior . " 
 In September 2011 , Bennett released Duets II , a follow @-@ up to his first collaboration album , in conjunction with his 85th birthday . He sings duets with seventeen prominent singers of varying techniques , including Aretha Franklin , Willie Nelson , Queen Latifah , and Lady Gaga . Bennett appears on the season 2 premiere of Blue Bloods performing " It Had To Be You " with Carrie Underwood . His duet with Amy Winehouse on " Body and Soul " — reportedly the last recording she made before her death — charted on the lower reaches of the Billboard Hot 100 , making Bennett the oldest living artist to appear there , as well as the artist with the greatest span of appearances . The single did well in Europe , where it reached the top 15 in several countries . The album then debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 , making Bennett the oldest living artist to reach that top spot , as well as marking the first time he had reached it himself . A model of Koss headphones , the Tony Bennett Signature Edition ( <unk> ) , was created for this milestone ( Bennett having been one of the early adopters of the Koss product back in the 1960s ) . In November 2011 , Columbia released Tony Bennett – The Complete Collection , a 73 @-@ CD plus 3 @-@ DVD set , which although not absolutely " complete " , finally brought forth many albums that had not had a previous CD release , as well as some unreleased material and rarities . In December 2011 , Bennett appeared at the Royal Variety Performance in Salford in the presence of HRH Princess Anne . 
 In the wake of the premature deaths of Winehouse and Whitney Houston , Bennett called for the legalization of drugs in February 2012 . In October 2012 , Bennett released Viva Duets , an album of Latin American music duets , featuring Vicente Fernández , Juan Luis Guerra , and <unk> among others .

 Regarding his choices in music , Bennett reiterated his artistic stance in a 2010 interview : 
 I 'm not staying contemporary for the big record companies , I don 't follow the latest fashions . I never sing a song that 's badly written . In the 1920s and ' 30s , there was a renaissance in music that was the equivalent of the artistic Renaissance . Cole Porter , Johnny Mercer and others just created the best songs that had ever been written . These are classics , and finally they 're not being treated as light entertainment . This is classical music .

 = Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football = 
 The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team represents the Georgia Institute of Technology in the sport of American football . The Yellow Jackets team , also known as the " Ramblin ' Wreck " , and historically as the " Engineers " , competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) . The Georgia Institute of Technology has fielded a football team since 1892 and has an all @-@ time record of 700 – 471 – 43 ( a <unk> winning percentage ) . The Yellow Jackets play in Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field in Atlanta , Georgia , which has a capacity of 55 @,@ 000 . The Yellow Jackets have won four Division I @-@ A college football national championships and fifteen conference titles . 
 A number of successful collegiate and professional football players once played for Tech . The school has 48 first @-@ team All @-@ Americans and over 150 alumni who have played in the NFL . Among the most lauded and most notable players the school has produced are Calvin Johnson , Demaryius Thomas , Keith Brooking , Joe Hamilton , Joe Guyon , and Billy Shaw . In addition to its players , Tech 's football program has been noted for its coaches and its , in many cases bizarre traditions and game finishes . Among the team 's former coaches are John Heisman , for whom the Heisman Trophy is named , and Bobby Dodd , for whom the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award and the school 's stadium are named . Heisman led the team to the highest @-@ scoring game in American football history , and both Heisman and Dodd led Tech 's football team to national championships . Dodd also led the Jackets on their longest winning streak ( 8 games ) against the University of Georgia , Tech 's most time @-@ endured rival . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = The beginnings : 1892 – 1903 = = = 
 Tech began its football program with several students forming a loose @-@ knit troop of footballers called the Blacksmiths . On November 5 , 1892 , Tech played its first football game against Mercer University . The team lost to Mercer 12 – 6 in Macon , Georgia . Tech played two other games during their first season and lost both of them for a season record of 0 – 3 . Discouraged by these results , the Blacksmiths sought a coach to improve their record . Leonard Wood , an Army officer and Atlantan , heard of Tech 's football struggles and volunteered to player @-@ coach the team . 
 Over the span of 1892 – 1903 , Tech only won 8 games , tied in 5 , and lost 32 . In 1893 , Tech played against the University of Georgia for the first time . Tech defeated Georgia 28 – 6 for the school 's first @-@ ever victory . The angry Georgia fans threw stones and other debris at the Tech players during and after the game . The poor treatment of the Blacksmiths by the Georgia faithful gave birth to the rivalry now known as Clean , Old @-@ Fashioned Hate . 
 In 1902 , Jesse Thrash was the team 's first All @-@ Southern selection . He began the season as a sub and closed it as the undisputed star of the Tech team . Oliver Jones Huie was selected by Ga Tech 's athletic association to coach the football team for the 1903 season when the team won 3 and lost 5 games . A professional coach was desperately needed if Tech wished to build a truly competitive football program . The first game of the 1903 season was a 73 – 0 destruction at the hands of John Heisman 's Clemson ; shortly after the season , Tech offered Heisman a coaching position . 
 = = = Heisman 's legend : 1904 – 1919 = = = 
 John Heisman put together 16 consecutive non @-@ losing seasons , amassed 104 wins , including three undefeated campaigns and a 32 @-@ game undefeated streak . From 1915 to 1918 Georgia Tech went 30 – 1 – 2 and outscored opponents 1611 to 93 utilizing his jump shift offense . He would also muster a 5 @-@ game winning streak against the hated Georgia Bulldogs from 1904 – 1908 before incidents led up to the cutting of athletic ties with Georgia in 1919 . 
 Heisman was hired by Tech for $ 2 @,@ 250 a year and 30 % of the home ticket sales . Heisman would not disappoint the Tech faithful as his first season was an 8 – 1 – 1 performance , the first winning season since 1893 . One source relates : " The real feature of the season was the <unk> advance made by the Georgia School of <unk> which burst from fetters that kept it in the lowest class for ten years . " His team posted victories over Georgia , Tennessee , University of Florida at Lake City , and Cumberland , and a tie with his last employer , Clemson . He suffered just one loss , to another first year coach , Mike Donahue of Auburn . 
 The 1905 team went 6 – 0 – 1 . The 1906 team beat Auburn for the first time . Stars of this early period for Tech include Lob Brown and Billy Wilson . The 1907 and 1908 teams were led by " Twenty Percent " Davis . 
 Pat Patterson was All @-@ Southern in 1910 . Patterson was captain in 1911 , a season in which future coach William Alexander was a reserve quarterback . Heisman helped students construct Grant Field in 1913 , when Alf McDonald was quarterback . The 1915 team went undefeated . 
 Arguably the most notable game of Heisman 's career was the most lopsided victory in college football history . In 1916 , Cumberland College ended its football program and attempted to cancel a scheduled game with Heisman 's Jackets . Heisman , however , was seeking vengeance for a 22 – 0 baseball loss to Cumberland in the spring of 1916 , a game in which Heisman suspected Cumberland of hiring professional players to pose as Cumberland students . Heisman refused the game 's cancellation and Cumberland mustered up a group of <unk> to play Tech . Tech won 222 – 0 . Neither team achieved a first down other than a touchdown , as Cumberland either punted or turned the ball over before a first down and Tech scored on almost every play from scrimmage . Jim <unk> , Tech 's kicker , kicked 16 point after tries , which is still a record for a single game . 
 In 1917 Tech won its first national championship behind the backfield of Everett Strupper , Joe Guyon , Al Hill , and Judy Harlan . It was the first national title for a Southern team , and for many years the " Golden Tornado " was considered the finest team the region ever produced . Strupper and captain Walker Carpenter were the first two players from the Deep South ever selected first @-@ team All @-@ American . 
 Heisman challenged Pop Warner 's undefeated Pittsburgh team to a decisive national championship game , but he declined . In the next season of 1918 , Tech lost a lopsided game to Pitt 32 – 0 . Center Bum Day became the first player from the south selected for Walter Camp 's first team . In 1919 , Auburn upset Tech for the SIAA crown . By 1919 , Heisman had divorced his wife and felt that he would embarrass his wife socially if he remained in Atlanta . Heisman moved to Pennsylvania , leaving Tech in the hands of William Alexander . 
 = = = Alexander continues the trend : 1920 – 1944 = = = 
 Alexander had attended Georgia Tech and after graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1912 , taught mathematics at Tech and served as Heisman 's assistant coach . In 1920 , he was given the job of head coaching Tech 's football team . He retained and Heisman 's shift and in his first season he saw Tech win an SIAA title behind captain Buck Flowers , the first Georgia Tech played inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame . Tech suffered its only loss again to Warner 's Pitt , and finished the season with a win over rival Auburn . Tackle Bill Fincher made Camp 's first team All @-@ America . 
 The 1921 and 1922 teams also claimed SIAA titles . The 1921 team suffered its only loss to undefeated , eastern power Penn State . Tech was captained by fullback Judy Harlan . Future Tech fullback Sam Murray was asked about a certain strong runner in the 1930s , " He 's good . But if I were playing again , I would have one wish – never to see <unk> down upon me a more fearsome picture of power than Judy Harlan blocking for Red Barron . " Barron ran for 1 @,@ 459 yards on the season . 
 From 1923 to 1925 , though Tech failed to claim a conference title , it had one of its best @-@ ever players : fullback Doug <unk> , " the outstanding back of the South for the past two years . " Coach Alexander recalled " The work of Douglas <unk> against Notre Dame two years in succession was brilliant in the extreme , as was his plunging against Penn . State when we defeated them twice . " Tech and UGA renewed their annual rivalry game in 1925 after an eight @-@ year hiatus . Quarterback Ike Armstrong thought the game clock read five seconds remaining in the game when in actuality it was five minutes . Williams set up his offense for a field goal and kicked it to put Tech up 3 – 0 on first down . Luckily for Williams , Tech won 3 – 0 . 
 In 1927 , Alexander instituted " the Plan . " Georgia was highly rated to start the 1927 season , known as the " dream and wonder team , " and justified their rating throughout the season going 9 – 0 in their first 9 games . Alexander 's plan was to minimize injuries by benching his starters early no matter the score of every game before the UGA finale . On December 3 , 1927 , UGA rolled into Atlanta on the cusp of a national and conference title . Tech 's well rested starters were helped by the rain and shut out the Bulldogs 12 – 0 , ending any chance of UGA 's first national title , while netting the SIAA title . 
 Alexander 's 1928 team amassed a perfect record and won the school 's second national title . The team was led at center by captain Peter Pund and upset Notre Dame . " I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man – Pund , center , " said legendary coach Knute Rockne . " Nobody could stop him . I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined . " The 1928 team was also the very first Tech team to attend a bowl game . The team was invited to the Rose Bowl to play California . The game was a defensive struggle , with the first points scored after a Georgia Tech fumble . The loose ball was scooped up by California center Roy Riegels and then accidentally returned in the wrong direction . Riegels returned the ball all the way to California 's 3 @-@ yard line . After Riegels was finally tackled by his own team , the Bears opted to punt from the end zone . The punt was blocked and converted by Tech into a safety giving Tech a 2 – 0 lead . Cal scored a touchdown and a point after but Tech would score another touchdown to win the game 8 – 7 . This victory made Tech the 10 – 0 undefeated national champion of 1928 . 
 Coach Alexander found campus spirit to be particularly low following the Great Depression . His successful football program ( and the other athletic teams ) had very few student fans attending the games . He helped to establish a spirit organization known as the Yellow Jacket Club in 1930 to bolster student spirit . The group would later become the Ramblin ' Reck Club . The 1939 team was SEC co @-@ champion . 
 The only retired jersey in Georgia Tech football history is No. 19 . The number belonged to Tech halfback Clint Castleberry . Castleberry played on the # 5 ranked 1942 Tech team as a true freshman and was third place in the 1942 Heisman Trophy voting . After ending his freshman year at Tech , Castleberry elected to join the war effort and signed up for the Army Air Corps . While co @-@ piloting a B @-@ 26 Marauder over Africa , Castleberry , his crew , and another B @-@ 26 disappeared and were never heard from again . Castleberry has been memorialized on Grant Field ever since , with a prominent No. 19 on display in the stadium . 
 The 1943 and 1944 teams won SEC titles . Coach Alexander finally retired in 1944 after winning 134 games as head coach and taking Tech to the Rose Bowl , Orange Bowl , Cotton Bowl Classic , and Sugar Bowl . To this day , Alexander has the second most victories of any Tech football coach . The record for most coaching victories in Tech history is still held by Alexander 's then coordinator and eventual successor Bobby Dodd . 
 = = = Dodd wins titles , sets records , & beats the Dogs : 1945 – 1966 = = = 
 Bobby Dodd took over the Georgia Tech football program following Coach Alexander 's retirement in 1944 . Dodd 's coaching philosophy revolved around player treatment and character development . He did not believe in intense physical practices but rather precise and well executed practices . Dodd 's philosophy translated to winning . He set the record for career wins at Tech at 165 career coaching wins including a 31 @-@ game winning streak from 1951 – 1952 . He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference Titles and the 1952 National Title , which concluded a 12 – 0 perfect season and Sugar Bowl conquest of previously undefeated , seventh ranked Mississippi Ole Miss . , in a season that also included victories over Orange Bowl champions , 9th ranked , Alabama , 15th ranked Gator Bowl champions Florida Gators football , 16th ranked Duke , and a 7 – 4 rival Georgia . While 9 – 0 Michigan State would capture the AP and UP titles , the Yellow Jackets ' were ranked first in the International News Service poll . 
 Dodd also understood the deep @-@ seated rivalry with the University of Georgia . His teams won 8 games in a row over the Bulldogs from 1946 – 1954 outscoring the Bulldogs 176 – 39 during the winning streak . This 8 – game winning streak against Georgia remains the longest winning streak by either team in the series . Dodd would finish his career with a 12 – 9 record against the Bulldogs . 
 Dodd 's tenure included Georgia Tech 's withdrawal from the Southeastern Conference . The initial spark for Dodd 's withdrawal was a historic feud with Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant . The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Legion Field in Birmingham in 1961 . After a Tech punt , Alabama fair @-@ caught the ball . Chick Granning of Tech was playing coverage and relaxed after the signal for the fair catch . Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and smashed his elbow into Granning 's face causing severe fracturing in his face , a broken nose , and blood @-@ filled sinuses . Granning was knocked unconscious and suffered a severe concussion , the result of which left him unable to play football ever again . Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt after game film indicated Holt had intentionally injured Granning . Bryant never suspended Holt . The lack of discipline infuriated Dodd and sparked Dodd 's interest in withdrawing from the SEC . 
 Another issue of concern for Dodd was Alabama 's and other SEC schools ' over @-@ recruitment of players . Universities would recruit more players than they had roster space for . During the summer practice sessions , the teams in question would cut the players well after signing day thus preventing the cut players from finding new colleges to play for . Dodd appealed the SEC administration to punish the " tryout camps " of his fellow SEC members but the SEC did not . Finally , Dodd withdrew Georgia Tech from the SEC in 1964 . Tech would remain an independent like Notre Dame and Penn State ( at the time ) during the final four years of Dodd 's coaching tenure . In 1967 , Dodd passed the head coach position to his favorite coordinator , Bud Carson . Dodd simply retained his athletic director position , which he had acquired in 1950 . He would not retire from athletic directing until 1976 . 
 = = = Coaching in Dodd 's shadow : 1967 – 1986 = = = 
 Bud Carson was Tech 's defensive coordinator in 1966 . His job was to appease the massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated . Carson was not the charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning . Carson 's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech 's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired . 
 Carson recruited Eddie McAshan to play quarterback in 1970 . After several Summer practices , McAshan won the starting quarterback job and became the first African American quarterback to start for a major Southeastern university . This decision initially polarized Georgia Tech 's fan base , but after winning his first 4 starts and leading Tech to a 9 – 3 season after three straight 4 – 6 seasons , McAshan won the hearts of the Tech faithful . McAshan 's besting of UGA in the annual rivalry game made McAshan a fixture on campus . The following season , however , led to Carson 's demise . In 1971 , Tech went 6 – 6 and a fan base used to Bobby Dodd 's 8 wins per season average forced Carson out by James E. Boyd 's hand . Carson went on to form the Steel Curtain Pittsburgh Steelers defense . 
 Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson . Fulcher appeared to be the right choice but quit after two seasons , overwhelmed by the Tech fan base . Fulcher 's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan , which peaked before the 1972 UGA game . McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend . Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest . Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl . The story exploded on the national scene when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game , allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest . 
 Pepper Rodgers was hired soon after Fulcher quit . Rodgers was hired away from the UCLA Bruins and like Carson and Fulcher , simply could not return Tech to its national prominence of Dodd 's era , and after six seasons , Rodgers had accumulated only 34 wins and barely a 50 % winning percentage . Rodgers flamboyant demeanor shortened his welcome at the school , and Athletic Director Doug Weaver , replaced him with Bill Curry . Homer Rice became Athletic Director , and attempted to reinvigorate Tech 's program by joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980 . The Georgia Tech football program reached its lowest point in modern history after the hiring of Bill Curry , who had no experience as a head coach , but was a refreshing change after the flamboyant Rodgers . Curry 's first two Tech teams from 1980 – 1981 went 2 @-@ 19 @-@ 1 with the only bright spots being a brilliant 24 @-@ 21 victory over Bear Bryant 's Alabama team at Legion Field to open the 1981 season and a 3 @-@ 3 slug fest in 1980 with then No.1 rated Notre Dame at Grant Field . Things had gotten so bad , they could only get better . He slowly rebuilt the team , restored a winning mentality to the Georgia Tech fan base , and in 1985 Tech won 9 games , including a 17 @-@ 14 victory over Michigan State in the All American Bowl . 
 Tech 's 1984 – 1985 teams featured the " Black Watch " defense . The Black Watch defense was created by defensive coordinator Don Lindsey and featured linebackers Ted Roof and Jim Anderson , safety Mark Hogan , and lineman Pat Swilling . The elite defensive players were awarded black stripes down the center of their helmets and black GT emblems on the side of their helmets . Curry 's leadership and ability to build a winning program sparked interest from the Crimson Tide and Alabama hired Curry away from Tech in 1986 . After Curry 's departure , Tech hired the talented Maryland Terrapins Coach Bobby Ross , who departed a Maryland athletic program in turmoil after the Len Bias tragedy . 
 = = = Old gold gets new shine : 1987 – 1991 = = = 
 Bobby Ross came from Maryland after winning three ACC titles over four years . Ross ' first season at Tech experienced a severe talent vacuum after Curry 's departure , and the players Ross inherited resisted the changes he demanded . The team only won two games , and Ross contemplated ending his coaching career after a humbling loss to Wake Forest in 1987 . Ross decided to remain at Tech and continued to rebuild Tech 's program . The turning point came in 1989 with the recruitment of Shawn Jones and several other key freshman . After two seasons and only five total wins , Jones helped the Jackets rebound at the end of the 1989 season . 
 In Jones ' sophomore season , Tech powered through their schedule and won the ACC . The four game unbeaten streak in 1989 extended all the way through 1990 and into the 1991 Citrus Bowl . The key victory in the streak was a huge 41 @-@ 38 come from behind upset victory over then No.1 ranked Virginia in Charlottesville before a nationwide TV audience . Tech demolished Nebraska 45 – 21 in the 1991 Citrus Bowl , finishing the season 11 – 0 – 1 , and earning a share of the 1990 National Title with the Colorado Buffaloes . 
 Tech 's winning streak ended against Penn State in the 1991 Kick Off Classic . Ross and Jones never replicated that 1990 season but managed to win 8 games in 1991 making Shawn Jones one of the most heralded quarterbacks in Tech history . Ross was offered a head coach position after the 1991 season for the San Diego Chargers , which he took . After first considering Ross assistant coaches , Ralph Friedgen and George O 'Leary , Tech hired Bill Lewis away from East Carolina soon after Ross ' departure . 
 = = = Controversies and Heisman contention : 1992 – 2001 = = = 
 When Lewis was hired , the Tech faithful hoped he would continue to build on Ross ' success . He had just led East Carolina to an 11 @-@ 1 record and a final ranking of ninth in the nation . However , Lewis ' first season at Tech in 1992 saw the Jackets collapse to only a 5 @-@ 6 record just two years removed from a national championship . Preseason All @-@ American Shawn Jones suffered from nagging injuries , leaving Tech 's offense inept . After Jones ' fourth year ran out , redshirt freshman Donnie Davis stepped in to fill his shoes in 1993 . However , in two years The Lewis era had completely squandered the successful momentum established by Bobby Ross . 
 During the Summer of ' 94 , George O 'Leary was rehired as defensive coordinator . With Davis injured in spring practice , Lewis recruited Tom Luginbill as his replacement . Luginbill was a proficient passer at Palomar College , a junior college in California , and his first two games in 1994 showed promise . Tech almost upset Arizona who was projected as the No. 1 team in the nation by Sports Illustrated and won 45 @-@ 26 over Western Carolina . However , Tech lost its next 6 games before Lewis was fired with three games remaining in the season . O 'Leary was named interim coach for the rest of the season , and was appointed head coach in 1995 . O 'Leary 's first season saw Senior Donnie Davis return as starter and Tech won 6 games . O 'Leary 's second season saw the emergence of Joe Hamilton as starter when Brandon Shaw struggled in his first two starts . Hamilton would eventually lead the Jackets back to bowl contention and Tech attended its first bowl in six years , the 1997 <unk> Bowl . 
 Hamilton 's prowess as a runner and passer thrilled the Georgia Tech fans . Offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen utilized a complex offense with Hamilton that featured option football mixed in with complex timing routes . Hamilton racked up yardage , touchdowns , and wins for Tech . In 1998 , Hamilton and Tech 's high powered offense won 10 games and a season ending victory over Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl . Hamilton 's senior year put him on the national stage . He was a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy against rushing phenomenon Ron Dayne . Hamilton passed for over 3000 yards and rushed for over 700 yards . But while Hamilton dazzled , the Georgia Tech defense was a liability ( they allowed around 28 points per game ) , and may have ultimately cost Hamilton the 1999 Heisman Trophy . In a late @-@ season , nationally @-@ televised game against Wake Forest , Tech gave up 26 points and Hamilton threw two interceptions and no touchdowns . As an indirect result , Dayne went on to win the Heisman ( Joe was runner @-@ up ) . Hamilton 's Georgia Tech career ended on a sour note in the 2000 Gator Bowl against the Miami , where the Jackets lost 28 – 13 . The following season , redshirt junior George Godsey , a more traditional pocket passer , succeeded Hamilton at the helm of Tech 's powerful offense . The drop @-@ off was minimal — Godsey continued where Hamilton left off , winning 9 games in 2000 and 8 games in 2001 . In 2000 , Godsey also led Tech to their third straight victory over the archival Georgia Bulldogs . 
 The end of the 2001 season saw George O 'Leary entertain a coaching offer from Notre Dame after Bob Davie announced resignation as Irish head coach . O 'Leary was eventually awarded the position , but it was revoked shortly thereafter when Notre Dame discovered that O 'Leary had fabricated several aspects of his resume . He claimed to have played three years for the University of New Hampshire and to have attained a master 's degree from New York University ; in actuality , he had attended NYU but did not graduate , and he never played a down of New Hampshire football . Following O 'Leary 's departure , Mac McWhorter was named interim head coach for Georgia Tech 's bowl game , a victory over Stanford in the 2002 Seattle Bowl . The following spring , Chan Gailey was hired to replace O 'Leary as Georgia Tech 's head coach . 
 = = = Great upsets , upsetting losses , and a termination : 2002 – 2007 = = = 
 Chan Gailey came to Georgia Tech in 2002 after head coaching stints with the Dallas Cowboys , Samford Bulldogs , and Troy Trojans . Gailey 's first team in 2002 managed to win seven games under the quarterbacking of A.J. Suggs . The most notable game of the 2002 season was an upset of National Title Contender North Carolina State . Georgia Tech rallied in the fourth quarter to upset NC State and end Philip Rivers 's Heisman Trophy hopes . In 2003 , eleven Georgia Tech players were found academically ineligible . Despite the academic losses and the playing of true freshman Reggie Ball , Gailey would lead Tech to a seven @-@ win season and humiliation of Tulsa in the Humanitarian Bowl . P.J. Daniels racked up over 300 yards rushing in the effort . 
 2004 and 2005 saw Georgia Tech improve talent and skill wise but Tech won seven games again . Star Calvin Johnson arrived as a true freshman in 2004 . His performance against Clemson in 2004 helped cement Johnson 's place in the annals of all @-@ time Tech greats . Two off @-@ the @-@ field problems affected the Yellow Jackets ' 2005 season . First , Reuben Houston , a starting cornerback , was arrested for possession of over one hundred pounds of marijuana . Houston was dismissed from the football team immediately following this arrest but a later court order forced Coach Gailey to allow Houston to return to the team . Houston would see little playing time following the court order . 
 At the end of the 2005 season , an NCAA investigation found that eleven ineligible players had played for the Yellow Jackets between the 1998 and 2005 seasons . These players played while not making progress towards graduation on the NCAA @-@ approved schedule . The football victories for that season were initially revoked , and Georgia Tech was put on two years of NCAA probation . Twelve football scholarships were stricken from Georgia Tech 's allotment for the 2006 and 2007 freshman classes . The Georgia Tech Athletic Department appealed this decision by the NCAA , and the records were restored but scholarship reductions and probation remained . Athletic Director Dave Braine retired in January 2006 , and Dan Radakovich was hired as Athletic Director . 
 Gailey 's most successful year at Georgia Tech was in 2006 with nine victories and the ACC Coastal Division championship . The Yellow Jackets football team reached its first New Year 's Bowl since the 1999 Gator Bowl and played the West Virginia Mountaineers in the Gator Bowl . Tashard Choice led the ACC in rushing yards and Calvin Johnson led the ACC in receptions and receiving yardage . After an impressive 33 @-@ 3 victory at Notre Dame to open the 2007 season , the team slid to finish 7 @-@ 6 . On the morning of Monday , November 26 , 2007 , Gailey was fired from the Yellow Jackets , two days after another heartbreaking loss to the University of Georgia . 
 The Yellow Jackets ' Athletic Department hired Paul Johnson , then the head coach at Navy and former Georgia Southern head coach , as Gailey 's replacement on December 7 , 2007 . 
 = = = Paul Johnson era : 2008 – present = = = 
 On Friday , December 7 , 2007 , less than two weeks after Georgia Tech announced the firing of Chan Gailey , Paul Johnson was announced as the new Georgia Tech head football coach . Johnson was hired under a seven @-@ year contract worth more than $ 11 million . Johnson immediately began installing his unique <unk> option offense at Georgia Tech . By the regular season 's end , Johnson had led the Yellow Jackets to a 9 – 3 record including an ACC Coastal Division Co @-@ Championship and a 45 – 42 win in Athens , GA over arch @-@ rival UGA , Tech 's first win against the Bulldogs since 2000 . In recognition of his accomplishments in his first season , Johnson was named 2008 ACC Coach of the Year by the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association as well as the CBSSports.com coach of the year . 
 Several weeks after Johnson 's defeat of rival Georgia , Georgia Tech rewarded Johnson with a new contract worth $ 17 @.@ 7 million , a 53 % raise that made him the second highest paid coach in the ACC before he had even completed his first year in the conference . In 2009 , Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to their first win over Florida State in Tallahassee in school history , a 49 @-@ 44 shootout that featured over 1000 total yards between the two teams . One week later , Johnson defeated No. 4 Virginia Tech 28 @-@ 23 at Bobby Dodd Stadium . The win broke an 0 – 17 losing streak to top five opponents at Grant Field in the past 47 years . On October 24 , 2009 , Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to their first win against the Virginia Cavaliers in Charlottesville , VA since 1990 . At Duke University Johnson and his team clinched the ACC Coastal Division for the first time since 2006 . Still , Johnson and company could not win their second game in a row over hated Georgia as the Bulldogs upset Tech 30 – 24 in the final home game of the season in 2009 . On December 5 the Jackets defeated the Clemson Tigers to make them ACC champions , a title that would be vacated on July 14 , 2011 due to NCAA infractions . The Yellow Jackets went on to lose to Iowa in the Orange Bowl , 24 @-@ 14 . 
 Georgia Tech had another significant win over the Clemson Tigers on October 29 , 2011 at Bobby Dodd Stadium . Clemson was ranked nationally No. 5 at the time , and the Tigers suffered their first defeat of the season at the hands of the Yellow Jackets . Tevin Washington led the Yellow Jackets to a 31 – 17 upset victory by rushing for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown , which was the most rushing yards ever by a Georgia Tech quarterback . In addition , Clemson 's offense was almost completely shutdown by Georgia Tech 's defense in the first half , and the Tigers were plagued by turnovers , which contributed to the win for the Yellow Jackets . 
 In 2012 , Georgia Tech was declared the winner of the ACC Coastal Division on November 19 , 2012 . Georgia Tech clinched the Coastal Division by beating Duke 42 – 24 and finished with 5 @-@ 3 league record . Georgia Tech played against Florida State in the 2012 ACC Championship Game on December 1 in Charlotte , which was coach Paul Johnson ’ s second appearance in the title game . The Yellow Jackets lost to the Seminoles 21 – 15 . 
 The 2014 Yellow Jackets , despite being predicted to finish 5th in Coastal Division by ESPN , garnered a 10 @-@ 2 regular season record ( 6 @-@ 2 ACC ) , including wins over then No. 19 Clemson and No. 9 Georgia to finish the regular season ranked No. 11 by the College Football Playoff Committee . The highlight of the season came when Georgia Tech defeated the Bulldogs in Athens in an overtime game that featured numerous swings in momentum . After a couple of controversial calls that gave UGA the advantage , the Rambling Wreck fought back , staying with the Bulldogs . With 18 seconds left , the Yellow Jackets delivered 30 @-@ yard drive that ended up with Harrison <unk> 's 53 @-@ yard field goal sending the game into overtime . After a 1 @-@ yard rushing touchdown by Georgia Tech RB Zack Laskey , the win was clinched by the Jackets when cornerback D.J. White intercepted UGA quarterback , Hutson Mason . Georgia Tech won the Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division and met No. 4 Florida State in the 2014 ACC Championship Game in Charlotte , NC , losing 37 @-@ 35 . The 2014 appearance marked Georgia Tech 's third ACC Championship Game in seven seasons under Paul Johnson . With the advent of the College Football Playoff , Florida State was chosen in the top four ( ranked No. 3 ) , under which circumstance the Orange Bowl selected Georgia Tech , now ranked No. 12 , as its replacement to face the No. 7 Mississippi State Bulldogs on December 31 , 2014 . In the orange bowl game , Justin Thomas led the Jackets to a dominating 49 @-@ 34 win over No. 7 Mississippi State . The Yellow Jackets finished the season 11 – 3 , No. 8 in AP poll and No. 7 in the American Coaches Poll . 
 = = Home stadium = = 
 The Yellow Jackets play their home games at Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field in Atlanta , Georgia . Upon his hiring in 1904 , John Heisman insisted that the Institute acquire its own football field . Grant Field was constructed to appease Heisman as well as bring a true home field advantage to Tech football . 
 From 1893 – 1912 , the team used area parks such as Brisbane Park , Ponce de Leon Park , and Piedmont Park as the home field . Georgia Tech took out a seven @-@ year lease on what is now the southern end of Grant Field , although the land was not adequate for sports , due to its <unk> , rocky nature . In 1905 , Heisman had 300 convict laborers clear rocks , remove tree stumps , and level out the field for play ; Tech students then built a grandstand on the property . The land was purchased by 1913 , and John W. Grant donated $ 15 @,@ 000 towards the construction of the field 's first permanent stands ; the field was named Grant Field in honor of the donor 's deceased son , Hugh Inman Grant . 
 The stadium now sits amongst a unique urban skyline and is the oldest Division I FBS football stadium . In fact , the only Division I stadiums older are Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Stadium . Grant Field was natural grass until 1971 . The astroturf was replaced by grass in 1995 . The stadium officially holds 55 @,@ 000 but has held up to 56 @,@ 412 in 2005 and 56 @,@ 680 in 2006 . 
 = = Logos and uniforms = = 
 The interlocking GT logo was created in 1967 at the request of Bobby Dodd . One of the varsity players was asked to design a logo for the helmets . Several variations of the design were submitted , including a yellow jacket design . The yellow jacket was not submitted because to make the insect look mean it would have to be stinging and therefore flying backwards . The interlocking GT was selected during the summer of 1967 and formalized into decals for the helmets . Over the years it became the official logo for Georgia Tech Athletics . 
 When head coach Paul Johnson was hired in 2008 , the Yellow Jackets adopted a new uniform style . One year later , the uniforms were altered to change the yellow to gold . A year after that , the uniforms were altered again . This time , the team adopted separate white uniforms for both home and away games , while retaining the previous styles ' navy and gold jerseys for occasions when the Yellow Jackets could not wear white at home . 
 = = Rivalries = = 
 Georgia – Georgia Tech 's fight songs and cheers are tailored to belittle the University of Georgia Bulldogs , and the perennial catch @-@ phrase for Georgia Tech fans for many decades has been " To Hell with Georgia " . Georgia Tech and the Univ. of Georgia have played each other in football over 100 times ( and hundreds more times in basketball , baseball , track and field , tennis , etc . ) and this rivalry has become known as Clean , Old @-@ Fashioned Hate . The annual football game is by far the most important game on the schedule for most Georgia Tech sports fans . The winner of this game takes home the Georgia State Governor 's Cup . Georgia Tech trails Georgia in the all @-@ time series 64 @-@ 40 @-@ 5 . 
 Auburn Tigers – The Yellow Jackets have played the Auburn University Tigers more than 80 times in football , and the series of football games between the two is the second @-@ oldest in the Southeast . Auburn Univ. or <unk> is by far Georgia Tech 's second @-@ most @-@ often played opponent in football . The rivalry is also intense in basketball , baseball , etc . 
 This rivalry lost some luster when the Georgia Tech Athletics discarded its membership in the Southeastern Conference in 1963 to become an independent institute . However , the Yellow Jackets continued their annual series of football games with the Auburn Tigers through 1987 , and with the University of Georgia though the present day . Georgia Tech and Auburn play football games in occasional years , and games in other sports regularly . Even though the Yellow Jackets have joined the Atlantic Coast Conference for all sports in recent decades , from a historical perspective , the Auburn Tigers are Georgia Tech 's second @-@ highest sports rivalry , behind only the Georgia Bulldogs . Georgia Tech trails Auburn in the all time series 41 @-@ 47 @-@ 4 , but beat Auburn at Tech 's Bobby Dodd Stadium in 2003 and in Auburn to open the 2005 season . 
 Clemson Tigers – The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and the Clemson Tigers have the fourth @-@ most @-@ played series in Georgia Tech football history . Clemson is Tech 's closest opponent , geographically , in the Atlantic Coast Conference . Also , in the ACC 's new two @-@ division arrangement , each team has one football opponent in the opposite division which has been selected as the two teams ' official cross @-@ division rival that they play every year . The Yellow Jackets and the Clemson Tigers are one of these six pairs . In addition to their geographical closeness and the Heisman connection , the Georgia Tech – Clemson pairing is also a logical one because of both schools ' long history in engineering , technology , and science education . Recently , the game has become known for last @-@ minute , extremely close finishes . From 1996 to 2001 , each of the six games was decided by exactly three points . 
 In 1977 ( before the Yellow Jackets had even joined the ACC ) , this football series was being considered for termination by the administration of Georgia Tech . Clemson football fans , in an effort to show their economic impact on the Atlanta , Ga . , area , brought with them to Atlanta large stockpiles of two @-@ dollar bills that were stamped with Clemson Tiger Paws . Georgia Tech leads Clemson in the all time series 50 @-@ 25 @-@ 2 . 
 Notre Dame – The Georgia Tech @-@ Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalry is infamous more for atrocious off @-@ the @-@ field behavior , rather than the actual games . Georgia Tech fans pelted the Notre Dame players , coaches , and visiting fans with fish and liquor bottles during the games played at Bobby Dodd Stadium during the 1960s and 1970s . One of the more noteworthy games was the 1980 3 – 3 slug fest at Grant Field during Bill Curry 's first season , when then No.1 ranked Notre Dame left Grant Field with its hopes for a national championship in ruins , and once again the visitors were pelted with fish . The football game in 1975 was made famous nationwide in the movie Rudy , in which the Notre Dame player Rudy Ruettiger tackles the Georgia Tech quarterback Rudy Allen . Georgia Tech trails Notre Dame in the all @-@ time series 27 – 6 – 1 . In 2015 , The Yellow Jackets will play the Fighting Irish on September 19 as part of a deal with Notre Dame and the Atlantic Coast Conference .
