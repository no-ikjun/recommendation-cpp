 He grew up in the Uranienborg neighbourhood in the West End of Oslo , and enrolled at the Royal Frederick University in 1933 . Following law studies , he graduated in 1939 with a cand.jur. degree , and travelled to the United States to study at Columbia University in New York . From 1940 to 1945 , during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany , he was employed at the Norwegian general consulate in New York City . He worked as a foreign affairs journalist for the conservative newspaper Aftenposten from 1946 to 1948 and for the Norwegian News Agency from 1949 to 1953 . He was a press attaché for the Norwegian United Nations delegation in 1953 and 1954 . After that , he was stationed in New York as a foreign correspondent and radio chronicler for Norway . 
 In 1955 , he succeeded Arne <unk> as secretary general of the non @-@ profit Norse Federation , and became editor of its periodical , The Norseman . In 1957 , Hambro was the chief editor of the Norse Federation 's 50th anniversary book , De <unk> et Norge med <unk> ( " They brought a Norway with them " ) . He edited its Christmas booklet , Norges Jul ( " Norway 's Christmas " ) , in 1975 . Hambro was succeeded by Johan Fr . Heyerdahl as secretary general of the Norse Federation in 1982 . Two years later , the federation started a summer course for Norwegian students , which it named after Hambro . 
 Hambro released a biography on his father , C. J. Hambro , in 1984 , titled C. J. Hambro : Liv og <unk> ( " C. J. Hambro : Life and Dream " ) . The book was well received by critics , and sold more than 30 @,@ 000 copies in 1984 . The book is known for revealing many secrets about his father 's private life , including his relationship with the actress Gyda Christensen . Like his father , Hambro translated many books from English to Norwegian , among them The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand in 1949 , First Among Equals by Jeffrey Archer in 1985 , and A Sport of Nature by Nadine Gordimer in 1988 .

 = Acer rubrum = 
 Acer rubrum ( red maple , also known as swamp , water or soft maple ) is one of the most common and widespread deciduous trees of eastern and central North America . The U.S. Forest service recognizes it as the most common species of tree in America . The red maple ranges from southeastern Manitoba around the Lake of the Woods on the border with Ontario and Minnesota , east to Newfoundland , south to Florida , and southwest to eastern Texas . Many of its features , especially its leaves , are quite variable in form . At maturity it often attains a height of around 15 m ( 49 ft ) . Its flowers , petioles , twigs and seeds are all red to varying degrees . Among these features , however , it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn . 
 Over most of its range , red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions , perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America . It can be found growing in swamps , on poor dry soils , and most anywhere in between . It grows well from sea level to about 900 m ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) . Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form , it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes . It is used commercially on a small scale for maple syrup production as well as for its medium to high quality lumber . It is also the State Tree of Rhode Island . The red maple can be considered weedy or invasive . It is taking over forests in the eastern US , replacing traditional mainstays like oaks , as well as hickories and pines . 
 = = Description = = 
 Though A. rubrum is usually easy to identify , it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics . It is a medium to large sized tree , reaching heights of 18 to 27 metres ( 59 to 89 ft ) and exceptionally over 35 metres ( 115 feet ) . The leaves are usually 9 to 11 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 3 in ) long on a full grown tree . The trunk diameter can range from 46 to 76 cm ( 18 to 30 in ) , depending on the growing conditions . Its spread is about 12 m ( 39 ft ) . A 10 @-@ year @-@ old sapling will stand about 6 m ( 20 ft ) tall . In forests , the bark will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree . Individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown . Generally speaking , however , the crown is irregularly ovoid with ascending whip @-@ like curved shoots . The bark is a pale grey and smooth when the individual is young . As the tree grows the bark becomes darker and cracks into slightly raised long plates . The largest known living red maple is located near Armada , Michigan , at a height of 38 @.@ 1 m ( 125 ft ) and a bole circumference , at breast height , of 4 @.@ 95 m ( 16 @.@ 2 ft ) . 
 The leaves of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives . As with nearly all North American maple trees , they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig . They are typically 5 – 10 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) long and wide with 3 @-@ 5 palmate lobes with a serrated margin . The sinuses are typically narrow , but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation . When 5 lobes are present , the three at the terminal end are larger than the other two near the base . In contrast , the leaves of the related silver maple , A. saccharinum , are much more deeply lobed , more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes . The upper side of A. rubrum 's leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either glaucous or hairy . The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) long . Furthermore , the leaves can turn a brilliant red in autumn , but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals . 
 The twigs of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small lenticels . Dwarf shoots are present on many branches . The buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color , generally with several loose scales . The lateral buds are slightly stalked , and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well . The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their reddish tint . The leaf scars on the twig are V @-@ shaped and contain 3 bundle scars . 
 The flowers are generally unisexual , with male and female flowers appearing in separate sessile clusters , though they are sometimes also bisexual . They appear in spring from April to May ( though as early as late January in the southern part of its range ) , usually coming before the leaves . The tree itself is considered <unk> , meaning some individuals are male , some female , and some monoecious . The red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old , but it significantly varies between tree to tree : some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old . The flowers are red with 5 small petals and a 5 @-@ lobed calyx borne in hanging clusters , usually at the twig tips . They are lineal to oblong in shape and are pubescent . The pistillate flowers have one pistil formed from two fused carpels with a glabrous superior ovary and two long styles that protrude beyond the perianth . The staminate flowers contain between 4 and 12 stamens , often with 8 . 
 The fruit is a 15 to 25 millimeter ( .5 to .75 inch ) long double samara with somewhat divergent wings at an angle of 50 to 60 degrees . They are borne on long slender stems and are variable in color from light brown to reddish . They ripen from April through early June , before even the leaf development is altogether complete . After they reach maturity , the seeds are dispersed for a 1 to 2 week period from April through July . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 A. rubrum is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern North America . It can be found from the south of Newfoundland , Nova Scotia and southern Quebec to the south west of Ontario , extreme southeastern Manitoba and northern Minnesota ; south to Wisconsin , Illinois , Missouri , eastern Oklahoma , and eastern Texas in its western range ; and east to Florida . It has the largest continuous range along the North American Atlantic Coast of any tree that occurs in Florida . In total it ranges 2 @,@ 600 km ( 1 @,@ 600 mi ) from north to south . The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the 95th meridian west , with only three exceptions , namely the Prairie Peninsula of the Midwest , the coastal prairie in southern Louisiana and southeastern Texas and the swamp prairie of the Florida Everglades . In several other locations , the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats . An example is the Bluegrass region of Kentucky , where it is not found in the dominant open plains , but is present along streams . Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt , despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area . 
 The tree 's range ends where the − 40 ° C ( − 40 ° F ) mean minimum isotherm begins , namely in southeastern Canada . On the other hand , the western range is limited by the much drier climate of the Great Plains . Nonetheless , it has the widest tolerance to climatic conditions of all the North American species of maple . The absence of red maple in the Prairie Peninsula is due to the species ' intolerance of fire . 
 A. rubrum does very well in a wide range of soil types , with varying textures , moisture , pH , and elevation , probably more so than any other forest tree in North America . It grows on glaciated as well as <unk> soils derived from the following rocks : granite , gneiss , schist , sandstone , shale , slate , conglomerate , quartzite , and limestone . <unk> can occur on very alkaline soils , though otherwise its pH tolerance is quite high . As concerns levels of moisture , the red maple grows everywhere from dry ridges and southwest facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps . It occurs commonly in rather extreme moisture conditions , both very wet and quite dry . While many types of tree prefer a south or north facing aspect , the red maple does not appear to have a preference . Its ideal conditions are in moderately well @-@ drained , moist sites at low or intermediate elevations . However , it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges , as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes . Furthermore , it is common in swampy areas , along the banks of slow moving streams , as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions . In northern Michigan and New England , the tree is found on the tops of ridges , sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils , as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps . In the far south of its range , it is almost exclusively associated with swamps . 
 Red Maple is far more abundant today than when Europeans first arrived in North America , where along with its cousin Silver Maple , it may have comprised a mere 5 % of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones . The density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing , much of it due to human factors , especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow @-@ rooted pioneer species like red maple , but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched . In addition , conservation efforts have caused a major increase in the population of white @-@ tailed deer since the mid @-@ 20th century . Deer will readily consume acorns , but leave maple seeds untouched , thus reducing the ability of oaks to regenerate . Concern has been expressed , as the ongoing spread of the red maple is changing the nature of eastern forests by reducing the number of oaks , <unk> and pines that would otherwise dominate . Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species ' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate . Finally , disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the US . While mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil , more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Red maple seldom lives longer than 150 years , making it short to medium lived . It reaches maturity in 70 to 80 years . Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce roots to suit its site from a young age . In wet locations , red maple seedlings produce short taproots with long and developed lateral roots , while on dry sites , they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals . The roots are primarily horizontal , however , forming in the upper 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of the ground . Mature trees have woody roots up to 25 m ( 82 ft ) long . They are very tolerant of flooding , with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage . At the same time , they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve , even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks . Red maple is one of the most drought @-@ tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas . 
 A. rubrum is one of the first plants to flower in spring . A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year . A single tree between 5 and 20 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 and 7 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter can produce between 12 @,@ 000 and 91 @,@ 000 seeds in a season . A tree 30 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 ft ) in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds . Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples . Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application . The seeds are epigeal and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released , assuming a small amount of light , moisture , and sufficient temperatures are present . If the seeds are densely shaded , then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring . Most seedlings do not survive in closed forest canopy situations . However , one- to four @-@ year @-@ old seedlings are common under dense canopy and though they eventually die if no light reaches them , they serve as a reservoir , waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above . Trees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north , Canada , Maine , Vermont , New Hampshire and New York , even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples . Due to their wide range , genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences . 
 Red maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease , cutting , or fire . One study found that 6 years after clearcutting a 3 @.@ 4 hectares ( 8 @.@ 4 acres ) Oak @-@ Hickory forest containing no red maples , the plot contained more than 2 @,@ 200 red maple seedlings per hectare ( 900 per acre ) taller than 1 @.@ 4 m ( 4 @.@ 6 ft ) . One of its associates , the black cherry ( Prunus serotina ) , contains benzoic acid , which has been shown to be a potential allelopathic inhibitor of red maple growth . Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation . In one study , stem elongation was one @-@ half completed in 1 week , after which growth slowed and was 90 % completed within only 54 days . In good light and moisture conditions , the seedlings can grow 30 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 ft ) in their first year and up to 60 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) each year for the next few years making it a fast grower . 
 The red maple is a used as a food source by several forms of wildlife . Elk and white @-@ tailed deer in particular use the current season 's growth of red maple as an important source of winter food . Several Lepidoptera ( butterflies and moths ) utilize the leaves as food ; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples . 
 Due to A. rubrum 's very wide range , there is significant variation in hardiness , size , form , time of flushing , onset of dormancy , and other traits . Generally speaking , individuals from the north flush the earliest , have the most reddish fall color , set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury . Seedlings are tallest in the north @-@ central and east @-@ central part of the range . In Florida , at the extreme south of the red maple 's range , it is limited exclusively to swamplands . The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief frost free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts . As a result of the variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation . This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from <unk> wilt , air pollution , and drought . 
 Red maple frequently hybridizes with Silver Maple ; the hybrid , known as Freeman 's Maple Acer x <unk> , is intermediate between the parents .

 = = = Toxicity = = = 
 The leaves of red maple , especially when dead or wilted , are extremely toxic to horses . The toxin is unknown , but believed to be an oxidant because it damages red blood cells , causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen . This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues , but also leads to the production of methemoglobin , which can further damage the kidneys . The ingestion of 700 grams ( 1 @.@ 5 pounds ) of leaves is considered toxic and 1 @.@ 4 kilograms ( 3 pounds ) is lethal . Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression , lethargy , increased rate and depth of breathing , increased heart rate , jaundice , dark brown urine , colic , laminitis , coma , and death . Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach , as well as blood transfusions , fluid support , diuretics , and anti @-@ oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50 % to 75 % of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Red maple 's rapid growth , ease of transplanting , attractive form , and value for wildlife ( in the eastern US ) has made it one of the most extensively planted trees . In parts of the Pacific Northwest , it is one of the most common introduced trees . Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit , its attractive and early red flowers , and most importantly , its flaming red fall foliage . The tree was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation . There it is frequently found in many parks and gardens , as well as occasionally in churchyards . 
 Red maple is a good choice of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system . It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples , although the tree 's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment . Like several other maples , its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving . It attracts squirrels , who eat its buds in the early spring , although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple . 
 Red Maple make vibrant and colorful bonsai , and have year around attractive features for display . 
 = = = Cultivars = = = 
 Numerous cultivars have been selected , often for intensity of fall color , with ' October Glory ' and ' Red Sunset ' among the most popular . Toward its southern limit , ' <unk> ' , ' Florida Flame ' , and ' Gulf Ember ' are preferred . Many cultivars of the Freeman maple are also grown widely . Below is a partial list of cultivars : 
 <unk> ' - Columnar to <unk> in shape with silvery bark and modest orange to red fall foliage 
 'Autumn Blaze ' - Rounded oval form with leaves that resemble the silver maple . The fall color is orange red and persists longer than usual 
 'Autumn Flame ' - A fast grower with exceptional bright red fall color developing early . The leaves are also smaller than the species . 
 'Autumn Radiance ' - Dense oval crown with an orange @-@ red fall color 
 'Autumn Spire ' - Broad columnar crown ; red fall color ; very hardy 
 <unk> ' - Conical to upright in form with a yellow @-@ red fall color 
 <unk> Bell ' - Compact rounded uniform shape with long lasting , burgundy fall leaves 
 <unk> ' - An old cultivar growing to 20 metres ( 66 feet ) with a narrow columnar to pyramidal form with dark green leaves turning orange and deep red in fall 
 <unk> ' - A compact , slow growing selection , this individual only reaches 10 metres ( 33 feet ) and has orange @-@ red fall foliage 
 <unk> ' - Branches are at a 45 degree angle to the trunk , forming a rounded oval crown . Though the foliage is deep green in summer , its orange @-@ red fall color is not as impressive as other cultivars . 
 'October Brilliance ' - This selection is slow to leaf in spring , but has a tight crown and deep red fall color 
 'October Glory ' - Has a rounded oval crown with late developing intense red fall foliage . Along with ' Red Sunset ' , it is the most popular selection due to the dependable fall color and vigorous growth . This cultivar has gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden Merit . 
 <unk> ' - Superior in alkaline soil , strong central leader , red fall color 
 'Red Sunset ' - The other very popular choice , this selection does well in heat due to its drought tolerance and has an upright habit . It has very attractive orange @-@ red fall color and is also a rapid and vigorous grower . 
 <unk> Sentinel ' - A columnar to oval selection with 5 @-@ lobed leaves resembling the silver maple . The fall color is yellow @-@ orange to orange @-@ red and the tree is a fast grower . 
 <unk> ' - A tree with a broad crown and early , long lasting fall color that a deep red to reddish purple . Growth is also quite rapid . 
 <unk> King ' - This fast growing cultivar has an upright @-@ oval form with deep green summer leaves that turn red to orange in fall .

 In the lumber industry Acer rubrum is considered a soft maple . The wood is close grained and as such it is similar to that of A. saccharum , but its texture is softer , less dense , and has a poorer figure and machining qualities . High grades of wood from the red maple can nonetheless be substituted for hard maple , particularly when it comes to making furniture . As a soft maple , the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples . 
 Red maple is also used for the production of maple syrup , though the hard maples Acer saccharum ( sugar maple ) and Acer nigrum ( black maple ) are more commonly utilized . One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple , as well as those of the Acer saccharinum ( silver maple ) , Acer <unk> ( boxelder ) , and Acer platanoides ( Norway maple ) , and all were found to be equal in sweetness , flavor , and quality . However , the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple , and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes , imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup . This being the case , red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge , making the season very short . 
 Red maple is a medium quality firewood , possessing high heat energy , nominally 5 @.@ 4 MJ / m ³ ( 18 @.@ 7 million BTU ( mbtu ) per cord ) , than other hardwoods such as Ash : 7 MJ / m ³ ( 24 mbtu / cord ) , Oak : 7 MJ / m ³ ( 24 mbtu / cord ) , or Birch : 5 @.@ 8 MJ / m ³ ( 20 mbtu / cord ) . 
 = HMS Indomitable ( 1907 ) = 
 HMS Indomitable was one of three Invincible @-@ class battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy before World War I and had an active career during the war . She tried to hunt down the German ships Goeben and Breslau in the Mediterranean when war broke out and bombarded Turkish fortifications protecting the Dardanelles even before the British declared war on Turkey . She helped to sink the German armoured cruiser Blücher during the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915 and towed the damaged British battlecruiser HMS Lion to safety after the battle . She damaged the German battlecruisers Seydlitz and Derfflinger during the Battle of Jutland in mid @-@ 1916 and watched her sister ship HMS Invincible explode . Deemed obsolete after the war , she was sold for scrap in 1921 .

 The Invincible @-@ class ships were formally known as armoured cruisers until 1911 when they were redesignated as battlecruisers by an Admiralty order of 24 November 1911 . Unofficially a number of designations were used until then , including " cruiser @-@ battleship " , " dreadnought cruiser " and " battle @-@ cruiser " . 
 Indomitable was significantly larger than her armoured cruiser predecessors of the Minotaur class . She had an overall length of 567 feet ( 172 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 78 feet 7 @.@ 75 inches ( 24 @.@ 0 m ) , and a draft of 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load .

She maintained an average speed of 25 @.@ 3 knots ( 46 @.@ 9 km / h ; 29 @.@ 1 mph ) for three days during a passage of the North Atlantic in August 1908 . 
 The steam plant comprised 31 Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers arranged in four boiler rooms . Maximum bunkerage was 3 @,@ 083 long tons ( 3 @,@ 132 t ) of coal , and an additional 713 long tons ( 724 t ) of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full fuel capacity , she could steam for 3 @,@ 090 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 720 km ; 3 @,@ 560 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) .

 Indomitable mounted eight BL 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) Mk X guns in four twin hydraulically powered turrets . Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 4 in ( 102 mm ) QF Mk III guns . During 1915 the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve . All of the remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action . The QF Mk III guns were replaced by twelve 4 @-@ inch BL MK VII guns during 1917 . 
 Her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun on a high @-@ angle MKII mount at the aft end of the superstructure that was carried from July 1915 . A 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss gun on a high @-@ angle MkIc mounting with a maximum elevation of 60 ° was also mounted in November 1914 and used until August 1917 . A 4 @-@ inch BL MK VII on a high @-@ angle mount was added in April 1917 . Five 18 @-@ inch ( 450 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the Invincibles , two on each side and one in the stern . Fourteen torpedoes were carried for them .

 The Invincible 's waterline belt had a maximum thickness 6 inches ( 152 mm ) amidships . The belt was 6 inches thick roughly between the fore and aft 12 @-@ inch gun turrets , but was reduced to four inches from the fore turret to the bow , but did not extend aft of the rear turret . The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by 7 inches ( 178 mm ) of armour , except for the turret roofs which used 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of Krupp non @-@ cemented armour ( KNC ) . The thickness of the main deck was 1 – 2 inches ( 25 – 51 mm ) and the lower deck armour was 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 – 64 mm ) . Mild steel torpedo bulkheads of 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms . 
 After the Battle of Jutland revealed her vulnerability to plunging shellfire , additional armour was added in the area of the magazines and to the turret roofs . The exact thickness is not known , but it was unlikely to be thick as the total amount was less than 100 long tons ( 102 t ) .

 Indomitable , accompanied by HMS Indefatigable , under the command of Admiral Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne encountered the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau on the morning of 4 August 1914 headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of Philippeville , but Britain and Germany were not yet at war so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to Messina to recoal . All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers , but Goeben and Breslau were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th . By this time war had been declared , after the German invasion of Belgium , but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay outside a six @-@ mile ( 10 km ) limit from the Italian coast precluded entrance into the passage of the Strait of Messina where they could observe the port directly . Therefore , Milne stationed Inflexible and Indefatigable at the northern exit of the Strait of Messina , still expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports , the light cruiser Gloucester at the southern exit and sent Indomitable to recoal at Bizerte where she was better positioned to react to a German sortie into the Western Mediterranean . 
 The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east , towards Constantinople , trailed by Gloucester . Milne , still expecting Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon to turn west , kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August when he set sail for Cape Matapan at a leisurely 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , where Goeben had been spotted eight hours earlier . At 2 : 30 p.m. he received an incorrect signal from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria — war would not be declared until 12 August and the order was countermanded four hours later , but Milne followed his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian breakout attempt , rather than seek Goeben . Finally on 9 August Milne was given clear orders to " chase Goeben which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north @-@ east . " Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles , and so he resolved to guard the exit from the Aegean , unaware that the Goeben did not intend to come out . Indomitable remained in the Mediterranean to blockade the Dardanelles , but Inflexible was ordered home on 18 August . 
 On 3 November 1914 , Churchill ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the opening of hostilities between Turkey and Russia . The attack was carried out by Indomitable and Indefatigable , as well as the French pre @-@ dreadnought battleships Suffren and Vérité . The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response . The results were deceptively encouraging . In a twenty @-@ minute bombardment , a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula , displacing ( but not destroying ) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers . The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences , and they set about expanding the mine field . This attack actually took place before a formal declaration of war had been made by Britain against the Ottoman Empire which didn 't happen until the 5th . Indomitable was ordered to return to England in December where she joined the 2nd BCS . 
 = = = Battle of Dogger Bank = = = 
 On 23 January 1915 , a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements . But the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty , which included Indomitable . Contact was initiated at 07 : 20 on the 24th when the British light cruiser HMS Arethusa spotted the German light cruiser SMS Kolberg . By 07 : 35 the Germans had spotted Beatty 's force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increased speed to Blücher 's maximum speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) if they were British battlecruisers . 
 Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape . Indomitable managed to exceed 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) and Beatty recognized her performance with a signal at 08 : 55 " Well done , Indomitable " Despite this achievement Indomitable was the slowest of Beatty 's ships and gradually fell behind the newer and faster battlecruisers . By 10 : 48 Blücher had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers and her speed had dropped to 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) and her steering gear had been jammed ; Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her . But due to a combination of a mistake by Beatty 's flag lieutenant in signaling and heavy damage to Beatty 's flagship Lion which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal halyards so that Beatty couldn 't communicate with his ships caused the rest of the battlecruisers to turn away from Hipper 's main body and engage Blücher . Indomitable fired 134 shells at Blücher before she capsized and sank at 12 : 07 . After the end of the battle Indomitable was ordered to tow Lion back to port as one of her engines had been knocked out , the other was failing and she 'd been hulled a number of times beneath the waterline . It took over a day and a half at speeds of 7 – 10 knots ( 13 – 19 km / h ; 8 @.@ 1 – 11 @.@ 5 mph ) . 
 She was transferred to the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) in February 1915 although she was being repaired after an electrical fire at the time . Rear Admiral <unk> Hood took command of the 3rd BCS on 27 May 1915 . The 1st and 3rd BCS sortied in response to the German bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24 – 25 April 1916 , but failed to locate the German ships in heavy weather . 
 = = = Battle of Jutland = = = 
 At the end of May 1916 , the 3rd BCS was temporarily assigned to the Grand Fleet for gunnery practice . On 30 May , the entire Grand Fleet , along with Admiral Beatty 's battlecruisers , was ordered to sea to prepare for an excursion by the German High Seas Fleet . In order to support Beatty , Admiral Hood took his three battlecruisers ahead of the Grand Fleet . At about 14 : 30 Invincible intercepted a radio message from the British light cruiser Galatea , attached to Beatty 's Battlecruiser Force , reporting the sighting of two enemy cruisers . This was amplified by other reports of seven enemy ships steering north . Hood interpreted this as an attempt to escape through the Skagerrak and ordered an increase in speed to 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) at 15 : 11 and steered East @-@ Southeast to cut off the fleeing ships . Twenty minutes later Invincible intercepted a message from Beatty reporting five enemy battlecruisers in sight and later signals reporting that he was engaging the enemy on a south @-@ easterly course . At 16 : 06 Hood ordered full speed and a course of south @-@ southeast in an attempt to converge on Beatty . At 16 : 56 , with no British ships in sight , Hood requested Beatty 's course , position and speed , but never received a reply . 
 Hood continued on course until 17 : 40 when gunfire was spotted in the direction to which his light cruiser Chester had been dispatched to investigate other gunfire flashes . Chester encountered four light cruisers of Hipper 's 2nd Scouting Group and was badly damaged before Hood turned to investigate and was able to drive the German cruisers away from Chester . At 17 : 53 Invincible opened fire on Wiesbaden and the other two Invincibles followed two minutes later . The German ships turned for the south after fruitlessly firing torpedoes at 18 : 00 and attempted to find shelter in the mist . As they turned Invincible hit Wiesbaden in the engine room and knocked out her engines while Inflexible hit Pillau once . The 2nd Scouting Group was escorted by the light cruiser Regensburg and 31 destroyers of the 2nd and 9th Flotillas and the 12th Half @-@ Flotilla which attacked the 3rd BCS in succession . They were driven off by Hood 's remaining light cruiser Canterbury and the five destroyers of his escort . In a confused action the Germans only launched 12 torpedoes and disabled the destroyer Shark with gunfire . Having turned due west to close on Beatty 's ships , the Invincibles were broadside to the oncoming torpedoes , but Invincible turned north , while Inflexible and Indomitable turned south to present their narrowest profile to the torpedoes . All the torpedoes missed , although one passed underneath Inflexible without detonating . As Invincible turned north , her helm jammed and she had to come to a stop to fix the problem , but this was quickly done and the squadron reformed heading west . 
 At 18 : 21 , with both Beatty and the Grand Fleet converging on him , Hood turned south to lead Beatty 's battlecruisers . Hipper 's battlecruisers were 9 @,@ 000 yards ( 8 @,@ 200 m ) away and the Invincibles almost immediately opened fire on Hipper 's flagship Lützow and Derfflinger . Indomitable hit Derfflinger three times and Seydlitz once , while the Lützow quickly took 10 hits from Lion , Inflexible and Invincible , including two hits below the waterline forward by Invincible that would ultimately doom Hipper 's flagship . But at 18 : 30 , Invincible abruptly appeared as a clear target before Lützow and Derfflinger . The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at Invincible , and sank her in 90 seconds . A 305 mm ( 12 @-@ inch ) shell from the third salvo struck the roof of Invincible 's midships ' Q ' turret , flash detonated the magazines below , and the ship blew up and broke in two , killing all but six of her crew of 1 @,@ 032 officers and men , including Rear @-@ Admiral Hood . 
 Inflexible and Indomitable remained in company with Beatty for the rest of the battle . They encountered Hipper 's battlecruisers only 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) away as the sun was setting about 20 : 19 and opened fire . Seydlitz was hit five times before the German battlecruisers were rescued by the appearance of the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve and the British shifted fire to the new threat . Three of the predreadnoughts were hit before they too were able to turn into the gloom . 
 The loss of three battlecruisers at Jutland ( the others were Queen Mary and Indefatigable ) led to the force being reorganised into two squadrons , with Inflexible and Indomitable in the 2nd BCS . However , after Jutland there was little significant naval activity for the Invincibles , other than routine patrolling , thanks to the Kaiser 's order that his ships should not be allowed to go to sea unless assured of victory . She was refitted in August 1916 , where she received additional armour over her magazine and turret roofs . Indomitable was fitted with two flying off ramps fitted above her midships turrets in early 1918 . 
 The end of the war saw the end for many of the older vessels , not least the two remaining Invincibles . Both were sent to the Reserve Fleet in 1919 , and were paid off in March 1920 , before being sold for scrap on 1 December 1921 . 
 = A Quiet Night In = 
 " A Quiet Night In " is the second episode of the British dark comedy television anthology series Inside No. 9 . It first aired on 12 February 2014 on BBC Two . Written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton , it stars the writers as a pair of hapless burglars attempting to break into the large , modernist house of a couple — played by Denis Lawson and Oona Chaplin — to steal a painting . Once the burglars make it into the house , they encounter obstacle after obstacle , while the lovers , unaware of the burglars ' presence , argue . The episode progresses almost entirely without dialogue , relying instead on physical comedy and slapstick , though more sinister elements are present in the plot . In addition to Pemberton , Shearsmith , Lawson and Chaplin , " A Quiet Night In " stars Joyce Veheary and <unk> Novak . 
 Shearsmith and Pemberton had originally considered including a dialogue @-@ free segment in their television series Psychoville , but ultimately did not ; they found the format of Inside No. 9 appropriate for revisiting the idea . Both journalists and those involved with the episode 's production commented on the casting of Chaplin , a grandchild of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin , in an almost entirely dialogue @-@ free episode , though her casting was not a deliberate homage . Critics generally responded positively to the episode , and a particularly laudatory review by David Chater was published in The Times , prompting a complaint from a reader who found the episode more traumatic than comedic . On its first airing , " A Quiet Night In " was watched by 940 @,@ 000 viewers ( 4 @.@ 8 % of the market ) . 
 " A Quiet Night In " was submitted to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for the 2015 awards , but it was not nominated . Pemberton and Shearsmith have said that they have no plans to do further silent episodes , but have compared " A Quiet Night In " to the highly @-@ experimental " Cold Comfort " from Inside No. 9 's second series , a sentiment echoed by some television critics . 
 = = Production = = 
 Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith , who had previously co @-@ written and starred in The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville , took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from " David and Maureen " , episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville , which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's Rope . " David and Maureen " took place entirely in a single room , and was filmed in only two shots . At the same time , the concept of Inside No. 9 was a " reaction " to Psychoville , with Shearsmith saying that " we 'd been so involved with labyrinthine over @-@ arcing , we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week . That 's appealing , because as a viewer you might not like this story , but you 've got a different one next week . " As an anthology series with horror themes , Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected , The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents . 
 The format of Inside No. 9 allowed Pemberton and Shearsmith to explore ideas which are less practical for other approaches to storytelling , such as the possibility of a script with little dialogue . Prior to writing " A Quiet Night In " , Shearsmith had spoken with directors , including Ben Wheatley , about the possibility of producing television without speech . The directors had expressed doubts , Shearsmith explained , because the success of dialogue @-@ free television comes down entirely to the visuals and filming . " A Quiet Night In " was inspired by an idea Shearsmith and Pemberton had discussed for Psychoville . The writers had considered omitting dialogue from a ten @-@ minute section in an episode , or even from the whole episode . Pemberton explained that this was not possible as there were " too many good jokes " which they wanted to fit into the sequence . This episode , like " A Quiet Night In " , dealt with a break @-@ in . 
 Inside No. 9 , for Pemberton , offered the " perfect vehicle " for revisiting the possibility of dialogue @-@ free television . Shearsmith said that , at the start of the writing process , the pair did not have the intention of scripting the entire episode without dialogue , and that it would be " great " to have ten minutes without it . However , Pemberton said it was easier to write once they had entered the correct " mindset " . Once half an episode had been written , Pemberton said , the pair thought " we 've just got to keep going " . The only dialogue in the episode is right at the end ; " what a great thing to get to the end and just have one line of dialogue " , Pemberton suggested , comparing the concept to that of the Mel Brooks film Silent Movie . 
 The story of " A Quiet Night In " revolves around a break @-@ in , which , combined with an argument between the people living in the house , means that the characters all have a reason to be silent . At 18 pages of stage directions , the script contained every joke in the episode , an exercise in planning atypical for Shearsmith and Pemberton . The story contains multiple " reveals " ; Pemberton explained that the he and Shearsmith " hope there 's an ' oh my God ' moment . There is always a desire to wrong @-@ foot the viewer . That 's what you strive to do " . Pemberton said that writing for a silent episode " makes you inventive in a completely different way " . 
 The episode was filmed at the White Lodge , in Oxted , Surrey . The episode 's burglars are played by the writers ; the pair were quoted as saying " we didn 't want to dominate [ the series ] , so we sometimes play fairly minor characters . But we know that , say , if we were writing something about two burglars , we 'd be the burglars . " Pemberton suggested that a partial influence for the episode may have been the children 's television series Brum . He said that he and Shearsmith had " always wanted to be a couple of robbers in that , so that might be where the idea came from " . Both writers agreed that their roles were " great to perform " , and Pemberton described the resulting episode by saying that it " worked out better than [ they ] could have dreamed " . 
 As the format of Inside No. 9 requires new characters each week , the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series . In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith , " A Quiet Night In " starred Denis Lawson , Joyce Veheary , Oona Chaplin and <unk> Novak . Pemberton commented on the appropriateness of casting Chaplin , a grandchild of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin , in an episode with little dialogue . Shearsmith stressed that the episode should not be considered a silent film in the same way as Charlie Chaplin 's , elsewhere saying that the casting was " almost an accident but maybe a little nod " . Bruce Dessau , writing in The Independent , described the casting choice as " a satisfying nod to silent cinema " . Both Oona Chaplin and the Inside No. 9 executive producer Jon Plowman stressed , however , that there was no significance in the casting . Chaplin also said that her character was very unlike herself , explaining that the " big boobs , the heels , the blonde wig ... freed [ her ] up amazingly " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Inside a large , modernist house , Gerald ( Lawson ) turns on Rachmaninoff 's Piano Concerto No. 2 and sits down to soup brought by his housekeeper , Kim ( Veheary ) . Through the windows behind him , burglars Eddie ( Pemberton ) and Ray ( Shearsmith ) are seen . Ray enters the house , then lets in Eddie while Gerald is using the toilet . Eddie is shocked to see that the pair have come to steal an almost completely white painting . Ray starts to dismantle the painting while Eddie keeps watch ; he tries to guide a Yorkshire Terrier out of the patio window , but inadvertently lets in an Irish Wolfhound . As Ray releases the wolfhound , Eddie accidentally throws the terrier into the window , so Ray stuffs the dog into an umbrella stand . 
 Sabrina ( Chaplin ) walks down the stairs , and Ray puts the painting back and hides . Sabrina turns down Gerald 's music to watch EastEnders . Gerald returns , sitting away from Sabrina . He turns up his music and the pair fight over the television remote , before leaving through the patio door and arguing , though their voices are muffled . Ray cuts away the canvas and replaces it with kitchen roll . When Sabrina reenters , she unknowingly stands on the canvas . Kim picks it up , mistaking it for laundry , and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs . Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something into his eyes . Ray knocks out Kim and sees the canvas in a laundry basket , which is sent up a laundry chute . He runs upstairs , while Gerald remains outside . 
 Sabrina packs a holdall , including the contents of the laundry basket . She locks the case and heads into an en suite . Downstairs , Gerald retrieves a pistol and heads back outside . Ray attempts to steal the key from Sabrina 's discarded trousers and he sees that Sabrina is a trans woman . On the patio , Gerald points the gun into his mouth , as Eddie stumbles around in the lounge area , having accidentally pushed chilli peppers into his eyes . Ray hides under Sabrina 's bed as she reenters the room ; lying on a sex doll with both breasts and a penis , he is almost discovered . Eddie washes his face , and Gerald starts to play " Without You " . Sabrina makes her way downstairs , taking the holdall 's key . Sabrina and Gerald dance . 
 Ray drags the case to the top of the stairs and meets Eddie . Gerald lays Sabrina down on the sofa , places a cushion over her face and shoots her . Gerald turns off the music as the doorbell is heard . Answering the door , Gerald sees a man ( Novak ) who holds up a sign reading " Hello , my name is Paul . I am deaf & dumb . " The reverse of the sign reads " Do you need any cleaning products today ? " Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina 's body as Paul waits . Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it . Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul ; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs . Paul continues to clean , but sees the <unk> in the cushion , and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window . Gerald heads outside to investigate , but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head . The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool , before both being shot by Paul . Paul rings someone and says " Hello , it 's me . Yeah , it 's done . " He looks to the fake painting , and says " I 've got it right here . Yeah , it 's fine . Not a peep out of anyone . " He takes down the painting and walks out , as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 The style of " A Quiet Night In " is experimental and represents a creative risk . While Pemberton and Shearsmith 's characters provide comedy , the relationship of Lawson and Chaplin 's characters adds an element of darkness . The two storylines are brought together with the violence towards the end of the episode , resulting in the juxtaposition of elements reminiscent of both the <unk> Brothers ( slapstick ) and Quentin Tarantino ( bloody violence ) . 
 Though the comedy remains black , the comedic style of the episode differs considerably from that of " Sardines " , the previous installment of Inside No. 9 . " A Quiet Night In " offers a kind of " sadistic slapstick " humour ; physical comedy , toilet humour and buffoonery are utilised , with the episode effectively becoming a farce . " A Quiet Night In " builds upon silent comedy tropes and norms , but , for the comedy critic Bruce Dessau , the tone is closer to that of Kill List or Sightseers than to the work of Buster Keaton . The episode features various twists , and these are generally in keeping with Pemberton and Shearsmith 's typical approach , though one is reminiscent of the Farrelly brothers .

 Critics generally responded positively to " A Quiet Night In " . David Chater , writing for The Times , gave a highly laudatory review , saying the episode was " the funniest , cleverest , most imaginative and original television I have seen for as long as I can remember – one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears " . He chose not to reveal too much about the plot for fear of " spoiling the fun " . Chater later described the episode as " <unk> in its originality " , and " one of the funniest , most imaginative programmes shown on television in the past 15 years " . Jane Simon , writing for the Daily Mirror , called the episode a " triumph " , while writers for Metro described the episode as " quality comedy " , and journalists writing for The Sunday Times characterised it as a " brilliantly conceived and choreographed mime " . Jack Seale , writing for the Radio Times , also stressed how the episode was " beautifully choreographed " , praising Pemberton and Shearsmith 's " willingness to attempt difficult concepts " . 
 Dessau considered the episode " genius " , and described the twist ending as " genuinely unexpected " . In The Observer , Mike Bradley called " A Quiet Night In " a " priceless silent farce " , but , in the newspaper 's sister publication The Guardian , Luke Holland was more critical . He said the episode was " an almost wordless half @-@ hour of physical comedy " , and that " it plays out like a French farce , its comedic strokes far broader " than those of " Sardines " . " If you find two men silently mime @-@ arguing about how long it takes to have a poo funny " , he continued , " you 're on sturdy ground here " . Later , a review by Phelim O 'Neill of the Inside No. 9 series 1 boxset published on theguardian.com described " A Quiet Night In " as " engaging , tense , funny , frightening – and accessibly experimental " . The episode was compared negatively to the later instalment " Tom & Gerri " in an Irish Daily Mail review — " A Quiet Night In " was called " patchy " — but was compared positively to " Last Gasp " by Rebecca McQuillan of The Herald , who said that " A Quiet Night In " was " something close to comedy genius " . An anonymous review in the South African newspaper The Saturday Star picked out " A Quiet Night In " as the strongest episode of the first series . 
 After the episode had aired , The Times received an email complaint about Chater 's positive review of the episode , which was discussed by the journalist Rose Wild . Part of the complaint read : 
 I told my husband how it was supposed to be the funniest thing ever , but we were horrified ! I 'll never be able to forget the little dog being thrown against the window and then stabbed to death by an umbrella – nor the gay man killed by his lover , nor what they had under the bed – nor the deaf man killing the thieves . Having thieves tiptoe comically around the house before having their heads blown off did not make up for my trauma . 
 In response , Wild said : " I am sorry if we left any permanent damage . In our defence , we did say ' black ' comedy . " Wild agreed with the reader 's comment that she and her husband " must be very different kinds of people " from Chater .

 " A Quiet Night In " was submitted to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts ( BAFTA ) , but was not nominated for a 2015 BAFTA award . In an interview with Digital Spy , Shearsmith said that this surprised him , saying " I was upset , I did think it was a shame that it 's not been recognised . You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work , and innovation , but I think people are doing that . I get told that every day on Twitter , or in meetings . " A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations , with Julia <unk> , of The Guardian , describing " A Quiet Night In " as " one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I 've seen on television " . 
 In 2015 , Shearsmith said that he and Pemberton had no intention to write any further silent episodes , as they would not want viewers to think they had run out of ideas , while Pemberton separately said that the pair had no desire to do what would be an inferior version of " A Quiet Night In " . " Cold Comfort " , the fourth episode of the second series of Inside No. 9 , was compared to " A Quiet Night In " by Pemberton , Shearsmith and some critics . " Cold Comfort " was also filmed an experimental style , with most of the episode shot from fixed cameras and displayed on a split screen . Despite this — with its focus on listening and the fact that it was mostly static — " Cold Comfort " could , for Pemberton , be seen as the " polar opposite " of " A Quiet Night In " . 
 In June 2016 , there was a screening of " A Quiet Night In " at Colston Hall as part of Bristol 's Slapstick Festival . The one @-@ off event , entitled " A Quiet Night In with Reece & Steve " , also featured Pemberton and Shearsmith discussing the episode on @-@ stage with Robin Ince , followed by a question and answer session with the writers . In an interview with Craig Jones of the Bristol Post , Shearsmith said that he was " very excited to come to Bristol " , and that he and Pemberton had been wanting to be involved with Slapstick Festival for some time . He said that " It is a lovely thing to be part of and it is great to see how respected slapstick still remains . " 
 = William Thompson ( Medal of Honor , 1950 ) = 
 William Henry Thompson ( 16 August 1927 – 6 August 1950 ) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the United States military 's highest decoration , the Medal of Honor , for his actions in the Korean War . 
 Born to a single mother in an impoverished neighborhood in New York City , Thompson entered the Army in 1945 and served tours in Alaska and Japan . At the outbreak of the Korean War , Thompson was a machine gunner of the U.S. 24th Infantry Regiment , a de facto segregated unit . 
 During the Battle of Masan in August 1950 , Thompson was part of a unit conducting an offensive along the Pusan Perimeter . When North Korean troops attacked his company and caused many men to panic and scatter , Thompson stood his ground , refusing orders to evacuate despite being wounded , and covering the retreat of his platoon until he was killed by a grenade . For his actions , Thompson was awarded the Medal of Honor , one of only two African Americans to be so honored in the war . 
 = = Biography = = 
 William Thompson was born on 16 August 1927 in Brooklyn , New York to an unmarried mother . Little is known of Thompson 's early life , but he grew up in an impoverished tenement house neighborhood . He dropped out of school at a young age , and spent his teen years wandering the streets . A local minister noticed Thompson sleeping in a park one evening and took him to a homeless shelter , the New York Home for Homeless Boys . Thompson remained a resident there until he turned 18 in 1945 . 
 Some sources alternatively state Thompson decided to join the United States Army as an opportunity to escape poverty , or that he was drafted . 
 = = = Military career = = = 
 Thompson enlisted in the army in October 1945 , and after basic combat training was assigned to a post in Adak , Alaska . After 18 months , he was honorably discharged from the military , but found adjustment to civilian life difficult and opted to return to the military . In January 1948 , Thompson reenlisted and was assigned to the U.S. 6th Infantry Division , which was on occupation duty in South Korea . When the 6th Infantry Division returned to the United States , he was reassigned to the U.S. 24th Infantry Regiment , U.S. 25th Infantry Division which was assigned to the post @-@ World War II occupation of Japan . His Military Occupational Specialty was <unk> , that of a heavy weapons infantryman who operated automatic weapons . 
 The 24th Infantry was a de facto segregated unit , but Thompson nonetheless enjoyed his time in the military . Described as " thin , hollow @-@ eyed and quiet , " he had enjoyed military life , viewing it as one of few places where an African American could enjoy some degree of comfort . He was a very effective soldier , consistently maintaining his uniform and equipment and keeping his firearms extremely clean . Thompson was also a skilled marksman and rarely had behavioral problems . He was content in the lower ranks of the military , preferring to follow orders instead of giving them . 
 At the outbreak of the Korean War , Thompson was a private first class , part of M Company of 3rd Battalion , 24th Infantry , the heavy weapons support company for the battalion . 
 The 24th Infantry first came into heavy contact with North Korean People 's Army troops on 22 July during the battle of Sangju . North Korean rifle fire came in on the dispersed regiment , and its troops almost immediately began retreating from the front , ignoring officers ' commands to stay in position . Historians blame the retreat as much on officers ' ineptitude as on the panicking of individual soldiers . The tendency to panic continued in nearly all the 24th Infantry operations west of Sangju . Men left their positions and straggled to the rear , abandoning weapons . On many occasions , units lost most of their equipment while on the move , even when not under fire , causing logistical shortages . In other cases , the majority of a unit deserted its position at the first sign of North Korean fire . The situation became so dire that the regiment 's senior officers set up a checkpoint west of the town and stopped every vehicle coming from the west , removing stragglers attempting to retreat . Many jeeps were filled with six or seven men claiming they were retreating after their position was overrun . The 24th quickly gained a poor reputation as a " bug out " unit , blasted for its poor performance during combat . Historians contend its accomplishments , particularly at the Battle of Yechon , were ignored , while shortcomings were seized upon to depict the 24th as a sub @-@ par unit , and African @-@ Americans as inferior soldiers to whites .

 On 6 August 1950 , as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning , the 25th Infantry Division was engaged in a counteroffensive near Masan , during the Battle of Masan . That night , M Company was supporting the division 's advance near the city of Haman , South Korea , in a mountain valley south of Sobuk @-@ san . As Thompson 's platoon approached the town , it was ambushed by a large force of North Korean People 's Army troops . Automatic weapons fire caused several men in the company to panic and flee . Those remaining were ordered into a tight perimeter by Second Lieutenant Herbert H. Wilson . 
 After a North Korean grenade knocked out the only other remaining heavy weapons specialist , Thompson manned the last heavy weapon in the platoon : his .30 caliber M1917 Browning machine gun . Thompson soon became the focus of the North Korean fire . During this period , Thompson was wounded several times by small arms fire and grenade fragments , but ignored his injuries and did not inform the rest of his unit . After the platoon was ordered to withdraw , Wilson ordered it to higher ground . 
 Crawling to Thompson 's position , Wilson discovered his injuries . Wilson ordered Thompson to withdraw twice , but the latter refused to obey and continued to fire on the advancing North Koreans . Thompson told Wilson he was dying and was not going to move back . Wilson then called forward two non @-@ commissioned officers , who unsuccessfully attempted to remove Thompson from the gun physically . Thompson told them , " Get out of here , I 'll cover you ! " Wilson reluctantly ordered the remaining men to pull back . As the platoon retreated , they heard grenade blasts around Thompson 's position , followed by a larger blast , at which point his gun fell silent . He had continued to fire his machine gun until he was killed . 
 A few days later , when M Company retook the area , they discovered Thompson had made a last stand and killed a large number of North Koreans before dying . He had prevented higher casualties in his unit as it withdrew .

 Thompson 's actions were initially overlooked by division commanders , who instead focused on the poor performance of the 24th Infantry Regiment , whose soldiers panicked and fled from combat . Thompson 's battalion commander , Lieutenant Colonel Melvin Blair , initially refused to submit a recommendation , until 4 January 1951 , five months after the action . Thompson initially received a Silver Star Medal for the action , but after Blair changed his mind he began pushing the paperwork through , personally locating the witnesses who could attest to Thompson 's valor . Blair hoped Thompson 's recognition would improve other commanders ' views on the 24th Infantry Regiment . Eventually , though , that unit was disbanded and its personnel integrated into other units . 
 On 21 June 1951 , General of the Army Omar Bradley presented Thompson 's mother with the Medal of Honor , posthumously recognizing Thompson 's actions .

 Thompson was the first of two African Americans to be awarded the Medal of Honor in Korea , the other being Cornelius H. Charlton in June 1951 . Charlton was also a member of the 24th Infantry who was recognized posthumously . Other African Americans who fought in Korea are known to have been nominated for the medal but did not receive it . They were the first two African Americans to be nominated for the Medal of Honor since the Spanish – American War , though several World War II veterans were later nominated . The two nominations had seen delays because unit commanders refused to submit their nominations . In all , 131 people were awarded the medal during and in the immediate aftermath of the war . 
 Pfc. Thompson distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy . While his platoon was reorganizing under cover of darkness , fanatical enemy forces in overwhelming strength launched a surprise attack on the unit . Pfc. Thompson set up his machine gun in the path of the onslaught and swept the enemy with withering fire , pinning them down momentarily thus permitting the remainder of his platoon to withdraw to a more tenable position . Although hit repeatedly by grenade fragments and small @-@ arms fire , he resisted all efforts of his comrades to induce him to withdraw , steadfastly remained at his machine gun and continued to deliver deadly , accurate fire until mortally wounded by an enemy grenade . Pfc. Thompson 's dauntless courage and gallant self @-@ sacrifice reflect the highest credit on himself and uphold the esteemed traditions of military service . 
 = Madonna : Tears of a Clown = 
 Madonna : Tears of a Clown was a one @-@ off concert by American singer Madonna , held at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne , Australia on March 10 , 2016 . The singer had not included Australia during her previous five concert tours , until the Rebel Heart Tour ( 2015 – 16 ) , so she created the show for her Australian fans since they had waited so long for her to perform . Madonna explained that the idea behind the show was to combine music and storytelling and was influenced by clowns . Tickets were made available to Madonna 's official fan club , Icon members and were non @-@ transferable , with the person 's name printed on them . 
 The show started four hours late , with the delay being caused by Madonna rehearsing . Tears of a Clown consisted of Madonna singing acoustic versions of her songs while dressed as a clown . The set list comprised previously unperformed tracks and her popular songs . It was interspersed with the singer telling jokes and anecdotes . The show received positive reviews from critics who appreciated the stripped down , confessional nature of the singer 's performance and the choice of the songs and the comedy . Madonna refuted reports of her being drunk on stage , calling them false and <unk> . 
 = = Background = = 
 Madonna had last toured in Australia in 1993 with The Girlie Show World Tour , her fourth concert tour . The country was skipped for the next five tours until the singer released her thirteenth studio album , Rebel Heart ( 2015 ) . To promote the album , Madonna announced the Rebel Heart Tour , and confirmed that she would be coming to Australia with the concert , as well as visit New Zealand for the first time . Before arriving in Australia , Madonna announced an extra show on March 10 , 2016 , at Melbourne 's Forum Theatre . The show was billed as an intimate gig , and was described by the singer as a fusion of music , art and comedy . It was titled as Madonna : Tears of a Clown show and was created for the singer 's Australian fans , who had waited for her to perform there for the last 23 years . During her promotional appearance at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2015 , Madonna confessed that she is a " kind of closet comedian " and did a skit on the show ; she added , " I always do extravaganzas , they always cost a billion dollars to make ... nobody makes any money ... and sometimes I dream about simplicity . " During the show , the singer explained her decision to do Tears of a Clown : 
 I 've had this idea in my head for this show Tears of a Clown which is a combination of music and storytelling . Because at the end of the day I do think of myself as a story teller . But it 's rough as f--- , so bear with me and give me all the support you can . It 's from the heart . I chose to debut this work in progress , this rough rehearsal , here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time . I 'm sorry . You 've been so patient , you waited for so long , I feel like I owe you a present , so this is your present ... I want to make a disclaimer ... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show , there 's the door . This is some brand spanking new shit . I don 't know if you like it raw . 
 Tickets were made available to Madonna 's official fan club , Icon members , and winners with details announced at <unk> and through concert promoter Telstra 's promotional webpage . According to newspaper reports , the tickets were non @-@ transferable , and had the person 's name printed on them . However , all of them were in the general admission category at Forum Theatre , which holds a maximum capacity of 1 @,@ 500 . With the production design and addition of catwalk , the space allocated became smaller than that . Prior to the show The Sydney Morning Herald reported that fans started queuing up in front of the venue , while Madonna rehearsed inside , as well as at Hisense Arena . Images and songs rehearsed were leaked to fan website <unk> , along with Madonna 's manager Guy Oseary uploading pictures on Instagram . Madonna made several references to clowns on her own Instagram account , including uploading a short video of her riding a small tricycle . The show was confirmed to be recorded and released along with the DVD for the Rebel Heart Tour . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 On the day of the show , the doors at Forum Theatre were supposed to open at 8 : 30pm , but since Madonna rehearsed well into the night , the show started later at midnight . The show started with Madonna appearing onstage , in a clown 's costume consisting of a billowing dress , pink and yellow <unk> , riding a tricycle and circled round it . She finally reached the front of the stage and fell down from the cycle . After conversing with the audience and throwing candy at them . Madonna started singing Stephen Sondheim 's " Send in the Clowns " , written originally for the 1973 musical , A Little Night Music , with images of Charlie Chaplin films displayed on the backdrop . She continued with " Drowned World / Substitute for Love " while standing in the center . Three songs followed with Madonna joining the band and sitting down with her guitar , including " X @-@ Static Process " , a cover of Elliott Smith 's " Between the Bars " , " Nobody 's Perfect " and " Easy Ride " . All the songs had displays showing circus themed videos ; following this Madonna started singing the song " Intervention " , while displaying an image of her son Rocco ; the singer referred to her custody battle with ex @-@ husband Guy Ritchie about Rocco . 
 Other acoustic versions of songs followed , including " I 'm So Stupid " , " Paradise ( Not for Me ) " , " Joan of Arc " and " Don 't Tell Me " . Before performing the next song , " Mer Girl " , Madonna explained that once she was at her father 's house and she visited the place where her mother was buried ; the place , overgrown with weed , became an inspiration behind the song . Then Madonna sang an acoustic version of " Borderline " followed by " Take a Bow " . The last song was an acoustic version of " Holiday " and it was performed as the encore of the show with Madonna playing the ukulele accompanied by her band and her dancers dressed as clowns .

 Cameron Adams from News.com.au wrote : " [ Madonna ] poured much of her sadness into her intimate two @-@ hour Tears of a Clown show , peppering emotional renditions of her hits with cheeky jokes and banter . " In another article reviewing the show , Adams noted that Tears of a Clown was " the sort of thing you never thought you 'd see a superstar do " . He complimented Madonna 's jokes , chatting about her life in @-@ between songs , for being " raw and vulnerable " and confessed that it was " fascinating — and difficult — to watch . We 're not used to Madonna on stage doing anything less than a fully rehearsed , slick stage show . " Concluding the review , Adams believed that Tears of a Clown professed Madonna 's touring direction into the future . Writing for The Independent Nick Levine noticed that the singer " tested out her stand @-@ up comedy skills with a series of risqué jokes and took the opportunity to defend her controversial fashion sense . " Debbie Cuthbertson from The Sydney Morning Herald gave a positive review of the show , saying " For the queen of self @-@ control , it was an open , at times even vulnerable insight into her persona . She seemed relaxed , drinking <unk> as she spoke at length between songs . " Cuthbertson also commended the choice of Forum Theatre as a venue believing it to be " inspired , and her crew lit up the grand old dame in a way that showcased all her delicate charms in a way I can 't recall any other act having ever done . " 
 Lachlan <unk> , music critic for The Guardian , noted the " bawdy " jokes and anecdotes shared onstage by Madonna . He went on to describe the show as " a weird mix of old vaudevillian @-@ style , M15 + , smut humour and bad wordplay ; some jokes about clowns , sex jokes that were really quite bad but she had such great comedic delivery " . <unk> also compared the show to Prince 's Piano & a Microphone tour , and complimented her singing during " Between the Bars " , describing it as " no costume changes , no highly synchronised dance moves , just Madonna playing an acoustic guitar and baring her soul on stage . " Francis Gibb from The Times found Madonna 's performance during " Intervention " as an intimate and " naked " moment for the singer due to the legal battle . Jon Lisi from PopMatters observed that unlike the Rebel Heart Tour , Madonna had " something to say " with Tears of a Clown show . However he was confused whether Madonna was being vulnerable as a clown or it was a case of the singer " trolling us " . Citing the instance of singing " Intervention " for Rocco , Lisi explained that " Of course she loves her son , but maybe this was less about her pain and more about the press ’ exploitation of her pain . As the show got more intimate with each song and personal anecdote , a disturbing thought crept into my mind : what if it was meant to be a joke ? " Lisi concluded that the show had the ability " represent a transitional point in [ Madonna 's ] career " , although the purpose was still unclear . 
 After the show ended , several media outlets reported that Madonna may have been drunk during the performance ; however , Madonna blasted these reports , by responding : " Thanks for supporting me . Too bad people don 't know the art of acting and playing a character . I could never do any of my shows high or drunk . And yes underlying all of this is sexism and <unk> [ sic ] which proves that not only do we not get equal pay but we are still treated like heretics if we step out of line and think outside the box ! Sexism is alive and kicking but i am # <unk> . "

 = Fort Greble = 
 Fort Greble was an American Civil War @-@ era Union fortification constructed as part of the defenses of Washington , D.C. during that war . Named for First Lieutenant John Trout Greble , the first West Point graduate killed in the U.S. Civil War , it protected the junction of the Anacostia and Potomac rivers , and from its position on a bluff in the Congress Heights , precluded any bombardment of the Washington Navy Yard and southeastern portions of the city . It was supported by Fort Carroll to the northeast and Fort Foote to the south . It never fired a shot during the war , and after a brief stint as a U.S. Army Signal Corps training facility , was abandoned and the land returned to its natural state . As of July 2007 , the site of the fort is a community park . 
 = = Planning and construction = = 
 Prior to the outbreak of war , Congress Heights ( so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could be seen from the tops of the hills ) were owned by the Berry family , who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland to the west of the Heights . In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run , panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack . These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac . 
 Multiple forts were constructed in the Arlington region to the southwest of Washington on land rented or leased from the pre @-@ war owners . Despite these efforts , following General George B. McClellan assuming command of the Military Division of the Potomac on July 26 , 1861 , he found that 
 not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side [ of the Potomac ] . There was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy range , which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without resistance . 
 In the wake of his declaration , fort construction was accelerated and expanded , with new strong points and artillery positions springing up around the entire 37 @-@ mile ( 60 @-@ km ) perimeter of the District of Columbia . In order to prevent an attack on the undefended Maryland side of the Potomac , Brigadier General John G. Barnard , chief engineer of the Department of Washington , directed that several forts be constructed on the Congress Heights in order to protect the Navy Yard and Washington Arsenal from bombardment . At the crucial western end of the Heights would be the then @-@ unnamed Fort Greble . 
 Planning and surveying for the proposed line of forts progressed quickly , and by the end of September 1861 , work had begun on what was to become Fort Greble . Under the direction of U.S. Army engineers , the work progressed quickly , and the fort , which was constructed as several closely supporting redoubts , was completed before Christmas . General Barnard , in a report to General Totten , chief engineer of the U.S. Army was able to report " Forts Greble and Stanton are completed and armed ; " on December 10 , 1861 . The fort was named for Lt. John Trout Greble , killed at the Battle of Big Bethel . The fort had a perimeter of 327 yards and places for 17 guns . 
 A fall 1862 review of Washington 's fortifications described Fort Greble as a " large and powerful work , well provided with magazines and bomb @-@ proofs . " Despite that praise , the report also recommended new gun platforms and protection for gun crews . 
 The rapid completion of the fort did have some drawbacks , however . The fort lacked some of the refinements that would be present at later forts like Fort Foote . In 1864 , civil engineer William C. Gunnell requested the removal of the wooden buildings that served as company quarters at Fort Greble so that the ammunition for the fort could be safely placed in magazines to be built in place of the shanties . There simply had not been time in 1861 to construct proper earthen magazines . This sort of constant renovation and improvement would continue throughout the war as forts were adapted to new purposes and new garrisons . 
 = = Wartime use = = 
 From the time of its construction , Fort Greble was never intended to serve as part of a continuous line of defenses stretching from the Potomac to Fort Lincoln at the extreme eastern end of the District of Columbia . Rather , the fort and its sister emplacements on the east bank of the Potomac were intended to deny the Confederacy the possibility of infiltrating guns across the Potomac in order to bombard the Washington Navy Yard . This fact is best illustrated by the 1862 report of the Commission on the Defenses of Washington , which was created by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to provide oversight to the Army Engineers constructing the defenses . Their report , released in December 1862 , illustrated the isolated nature of the Eastern Branch defenses : 
 In relation to this group of works , the Commission express the opinion that an enemy will not attempt to enter Washington from this direction , and that we cannot ( as a general rule ) expect to be able to meet him with a line of troops . What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy @-@ yard and arsenal . For this purpose the works should be self @-@ sustaining , or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish , and upon succor , which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed . 
 Over the course of the war , these words would prove prophetic . No Confederate forces would bring Fort Greble under fire during its entire four @-@ year active military career , and its garrison units , rotated regularly , served quietly behind its earthen walls . 
 = = = Life at the fort = = = 
 Daily life at Fort Greble was similar to that experienced by soldiers at other forts in the Washington defenses . A soldier 's normal day began with <unk> before sunrise and was immediately followed by morning muster , at which the soldiers of the garrison were counted and reported for sick call . Following muster , the day was filled with work on improving the fort 's defenses and drill of various types , usually consisting of gunnery practice , but also including infantry and parade drill . This schedule usually continued , broken by meal and rest breaks , until taps was called at 8 : 00 or 9 : 00 p.m. Sunday was a break in the routine as the muster was immediately followed by a weekly inspection and church call . Sunday afternoons were a soldier 's free time , and this was usually filled by writing letters home , bathing , or simply catching up on extra sleep . 
 For much of the year , the garrison would be plagued by mosquitoes and the heat and humidity common to the Washington area during the summer . Though Fort Greble was built on a hill , the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers , a breeding ground for malaria . Communication with the outside world was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts , and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule . Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon , and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses , Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts . 
 Until 1864 , communications between Fort Greble and its neighbors had to be routed through departmental headquarters in Washington . After a test of the system completely failed , efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts , and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire . Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton , near Uniontown , and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts . 
 = = = The garrison = = = 
 In accordance to a plan laid out in an October 1861 report by General Barnard , " rear line " forts were to receive one man per yard of fort perimeter when fully garrisoned . Front @-@ line forts were to receive two men per yard , when needed . However , most forts were not kept fully garrisoned at all times . Due to its location north of the Potomac River , Fort Greble was considered a rear @-@ line fort . To man Fort Greble 's 327 yards ( 299 m ) of perimeter , Barnard designated a force of 165 men . If the fort needed to be fully garrisoned due to an impending attack , the difference in the actual garrison and the plan would be made good from Washington 's reserve force . As General Barnard would say in a December 24 , 1862 report , " It is seldom necessary to keep these infantry supports attached to the works . " 
 However , this plan only applied to men manning the walls of the fort , not the artillerymen who would be serving the fort 's guns . To man the guns of Fort Greble and those of Washington 's other forts , Barnard designated three crews for each gun . These crews would be permanently located at the fort , unlike the men assigned to the walls of the fort . To fire Fort Greble 's planned complement of 15 guns , Barnard assigned 255 artillerymen . This plan was affected by the needs of the war . As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted , the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements . By 1864 , Washington had been stripped to a total less than half that of Barnard 's 1861 recommendation . 
 According to a May 1864 report by General Albion P. Howe , Inspector of Artillery , the garrison of Fort Greble consisted of a single company of the Seventh <unk> Heavy Artillery , Massachusetts Volunteers , commanded by Captain George S. Worcester . 125 men of various ranks served six 12 @-@ pounder field howitzers , six 32 @-@ pounder barbette guns , one 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) siege howitzer , one <unk> mortar , one 10 @-@ inch ( 250 mm ) mortar , and one 30 @-@ pounder Parrott rifle . The same report lists the garrison as " drilled some at artillery and infantry , " putting it a step ahead of the garrisons of neighboring forts Wagner and Ricketts , which were judged as " <unk> but little at artillery and infantry ; not efficient . " 
 = = Post @-@ war use = = 
 After the surrender of General Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9 , 1865 , the primary reason for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist . Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander , chief engineer of the Washington defenses , were to divide the defenses into three classes : those that should be kept active ( first @-@ class ) , those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state ( second @-@ class ) , and those that should be abandoned entirely ( third @-@ class ) . Fort Greble fell into the second @-@ class category . 
 To this end , the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89 , which stated ( in part ) that the guns and ammunition removed from the dismantled forts should be kept in storage . Fort Greble was chosen as one of the storage locations . As a second @-@ class fort , Fort Greble continued to receive regular maintenance and upkeep . By the end of August 1865 , however , with funds running low , and no further appropriations likely , this work began to slack off . As the money ran out , more and more forts were designated as second- or third @-@ class locations , and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners . 
 In August 1867 , the commander of the Department of Washington wrote to the Chief of Ordnance , asking how much longer he needed Fort Greble as an ordnance depot for materiel removed from dismantled forts . When it could do so , the Ordnance Department removed its property to the Washington Arsenal , now Fort McNair , or transferred it to a still @-@ garrisoned fort , though with post @-@ war budget cuts , these were becoming few and far between . 
 The infant Army Signal Corps , which had played a valuable part in the Civil War , had a need for a post @-@ war training ground . In 1866 , the Army allowed the Chief Signal Officer of the Army , General Albert J. Myer , to use Fort Greble for this purpose . Then , in 1868 , Myer requested and received control over Fort Greble as a signal communications school for instruction in electric telegraphy and visual signaling . In January 1869 , however , Myer moved the school from Fort Greble and soon established it at Fort Whipple , Virginia . 
 Following that move , the fort was sold back into private ownership , where the land was later purchased for use as a park . Throughout the 20th century , various attempts were made to include Fort Greble as the terminus of a " ring " of parks surrounding the city of Washington . The parks would be connected by a 23 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 37 @.@ 8 @-@ km ) Fort Circle Drive , but these plans never made it off the drawing board , due to budget concerns and the political issues involved . Though many of the forts — including Fort Greble — did become parks , they were not connected in a grand plan surrounding Washington . Today , the site of Fort Greble is home to Fort Greble Recreation Center , a community center for local youths and neighborhood events . In 2006 , a lighted baseball field was built at the site as part of a Washington @-@ wide renovation of city parks .

 Sir Victor Ewings Negus , MS , FRCS ( 6 February 1887 – 15 July 1974 ) was a British surgeon who specialised in laryngology and also made fundamental contributions to comparative anatomy with his work on the structure and evolution of the larynx . He was born and educated in London , studying at King 's College School , then King 's College London , followed by King 's College Hospital . The final years of his medical training were interrupted by the First World War , during which he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps . After the war , he qualified as a surgeon and studied with <unk> in France and the USA before resuming his career at King 's College Hospital where he became a junior surgeon in 1924 . 
 In the 1920s , Negus worked on aspects of both throat surgery and the anatomy of the larynx , the latter work contributing to his degree of Master of Surgery ( 1924 ) . His surgical innovations included designs for laryngoscopes , <unk> , <unk> , an operating table , and tracheotomy equipment . His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx ( 1929 ) and his work on the clinical text Diseases of the Nose and Throat , starting with the fourth edition of 1937 . Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology . He became a senior surgeon at King 's College Hospital in 1940 and a consulting surgeon in 1946 . 
 Negus was one of the founders of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists , helping to establish his speciality as a discipline within the newly formed National Health Service . He was a member of numerous international and national otolaryngology organisations , and presided over the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology in London in 1949 . In this period of his career following the Second World War he also worked on the anatomy of the paranasal sinuses , and played a key role in rebuilding and establishing collections of animal dissections used by comparative anatomists . 
 Negus , who married in 1929 and had two sons , retired in 1952 , though he continued to publish on comparative anatomy and the history of medicine . His honours before and after retirement included the Fellowship of King 's College , London ( 1945 ) , an honorary degree ( 1950 ) , the Lister Medal ( 1954 ) , a knighthood ( 1956 ) , honorary fellowships of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh ( 1949 ) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland ( 1958 ) , and the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England ( 1969 ) . He died in Hindhead , Surrey , aged 87 in 1974 . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Victor Ewings Negus was born on 6 February 1887 in Tooting , London , the youngest of three sons of William and Emily Negus ( née Ewings ) . His father was a solicitor , Justice of the Peace , and Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Surrey . Victor 's pre @-@ university education took place at King 's College School . In 1906 , he was awarded a <unk> scholarship to King 's College London , on the Strand , where his studies for the next three years included <unk> and preclinical subjects . 
 After passing the required examinations , Negus proceeded in 1909 to the next stage of his basic medical education at the nearby King 's College Hospital , at that time located on Portugal Street between the Strand and Lincoln 's Inn Fields . Three more years of study led to the attainment in 1912 of the <unk> and <unk> ( Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians , known as the ' conjoint diploma ' ) , marking his formal qualification to practice medicine . In the final year of these studies , Negus was an usher at the funeral service for Lord Lister at Westminster Abbey . Another connection with Lister 's generation came when Negus worked as surgical dresser and house surgeon under Sir William Watson Cheyne , who had himself been house surgeon to Lister . The postgraduate stages of Negus 's training involved specialisation in diseases of the ear , nose and throat , a direction influenced and guided by the <unk> St Clair Thomson ( 1857 – 1943 ) . In the years following his qualification in 1912 , Negus worked at King 's College Hospital , and had started further clinical training at the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat in Golden Square , Soho , but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War . 
 Negus served in the Royal Army Medical Corps ( RAMC ) with the British Expeditionary Force for the first 18 months of the war . He initially deployed with the 1st General Hospital , then saw action in the trenches on the front line with a machine @-@ gun battalion at the First Battle of Ypres . The effects of explosives during this period left him with tinnitus . This was followed by a period serving on hospital barges . In 1916 , Negus , still with the RAMC , was posted to the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division ( part of the British Indian Army ) and took part in the Mesopotamia Campaign . As one of those who had deployed to the Western Front in the opening months of the war , he was later awarded the Mons Star . His service in the RAMC ended in 1919 . 
 = = Surgical career and family = = 
 Following his discharge from the army , Negus , again with the advice and guidance of St Clair Thomson , resumed his studies and preparations for a career in throat surgery . By 1921 he had graduated MB BS ( London ) [ Bachelor of Medicine , Bachelor of Surgery ] and by 1922 he had taken the surgical exams for the FRCS ( Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons ) qualification . To gain further experience , he spent periods of time abroad studying with renowned <unk> : firstly with Emil Moure and Georges Portmann in Bordeaux , France ; and secondly with Chevalier Jackson in Philadelphia , USA . On his return to London , he became clinical assistant to St Clair Thomson at King 's College Hospital . 
 At this point , still early in his surgical career , Negus took a different approach to that which was common at the time . Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT ( ear , nose and throat ) speciality , he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years . While engaged in this research , Negus continued his work at King 's College Hospital , being appointed junior surgeon in 1924 . It was during this period , following his return from the USA , that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson , and worked to improve the designs of the <unk> and other equipment used in ENT surgery . These instruments , developed in collaboration with the <unk> @-@ Urinary Company of London , included laryngoscopes , <unk> ( such as the Negus bronchoscope ) and <unk> . Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table ( known as the King 's College table ) , and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes . He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy . 
 In 1929 , Negus married Winifred Adelaide Gladys Rennie ( 1901 – 1980 , known as Eve ) with whom he would have two sons , David ( 1930 – 2010 ) and Richard ( 1932 – 2008 ) . Negus 's surgical and medical teaching career continued to progress , and he was appointed surgeon in 1931 . It was in 1937 that his major work in clinical medicine , the fourth edition of Diseases of the Nose and Throat , was published . This work , " still used for reference " , was described as " for many years the standard textbook in English on this subject " , and as Negus 's " major literary contribution to clinical medicine " . The 1937 edition continued work on earlier editions by St Clair Thomson , who worked jointly with Negus on the new edition . A fifth edition worked on by both men was published in 1948 following Thomson 's death , and the sixth edition by Negus alone appeared in 1955 . 
 In 1939 , the Negus family moved to Haslemere , Surrey . During the Second World War , Negus again served in a medical capacity , this time with the Emergency Medical Service ( EMS ) at Horton Hospital , Epsom , from 1939 to 1946 . In 1940 , on the retirement of his colleague Charles Hope , he had been appointed senior surgeon at King 's College Hospital , and in 1946 he reached the peak of his profession as a consulting surgeon . During this post @-@ war period one of Negus 's patients was the former ( and future ) prime minister Winston Churchill , who in 1950 was diagnosed by Negus with high @-@ frequency sensorineural hearing loss . Negus retired from clinical and teaching work in 1952 at the age of 65 .

 In parallel with his career as a throat surgeon at a teaching hospital , Negus become a leading expert on the comparative anatomy of first the larynx and then the nose and the paranasal sinuses . This strand of his professional life started with the research he carried out in his thirties in the 1920s that eventually led to his degree of Master of Surgery ( MS ) , awarded by the University of London . This work started as early as 1921 in the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons of England , whose museum housed the collections of animal specimens gathered by the anatomist John Hunter . Working on these specimens , and adding to them with others supplied by the Zoological Society of London , Negus carried out meticulous dissections that enabled him to trace the stages of evolution and development of the larynx across a wide variety of animals . Part of this research was submitted as his thesis , and the excellence of the work was recognised by the award of a Gold Medal with his MS degree in 1924 . In addition to this , Negus gave the Arris and Gale Lecture on 28 April 1924 at the Royal College of Surgeons , with his talk titled " On the Mechanism of the Larynx " . 
 Further recognition of his work came when Negus was made Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1925 , followed three years later in 1928 by the awarding of the triennial John Hunter Medal ( 1925 – 7 ) from the Royal College of Surgeons , which came with a prize of £ 50 . The following year Negus published his observations and conclusions in The Mechanism of the Larynx ( 1929 ) , a " classic piece of research " still referred to forty @-@ five years later in 1974 as " the standard reference book " on this topic . Negus 's work had shown that the main function of the larynx is as a valve that only allows air into the lower respiratory tract . In humans , the voice is only a byproduct of this more vital function . Another lecture resulting from this work was given under the auspices of the University of London 's Semon Lectureship , named after the German @-@ born British laryngologist Felix Semon ( 1849 – 1921 ) . This talk was delivered on 6 November 1930 at the Royal Society of Medicine under the title " Observations on Semon 's Law " . 
 These earlier works were followed after the Second World War by the publication of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Larynx ( 1949 ) . This work was a condensed and updated version of Negus 's original 1929 work on the larynx . It was in this post @-@ war period that Negus would increasingly study the function of the nose , both as the organ for the sense of smell ( olfaction ) and the role of the nose in respiration . This was prompted by wartime damage in 1941 to the Royal College of Surgeons ' Hunterian Museum , which included the loss of parts of the <unk> Collection . This collection had contained specimens of the accessory sinuses ( paranasal sinuses ) prepared by the Hungarian laryngologist Adolf <unk> ( 1857 – 1919 ) and demonstrated by him in 1900 . Negus undertook to replace the destroyed and damaged specimens and to extend the collection with animal specimens . This work was covered in Negus 's Hunterian Lecture , delivered on 20 May 1954 at the Royal College of Surgeons under the title " Introduction to the Comparative Anatomy of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses " . This was followed four years later by the publication of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses ( 1958 ) . Much of this later work was carried out after retirement in 1952 , both at the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons and at the Ferens Institute of Otolaryngology at the Middlesex Hospital . Negus 's research over many years on these topics and their relation to nose and throat surgery led to the awarding of the 1954 Lister Medal . This was presented the following year when Negus delivered the Lister Oration on 5 April 1955 at the Royal College of Surgeons . The oration was titled " The Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory Tract in Relation to Clinical Problems " . Ten years later , towards the end of his life , Negus published The Biology of Respiration ( 1965 ) . 
 Negus 's legacy in this field was assessed in 1986 by the British surgeon and comparative anatomist Sir Donald Frederick Norris Harrison , himself an expert on the mammalian larynx . Writing further on the subject in 1995 , Harrison states that Negus 's " pioneer research into the mechanism of the animal larynx [ ... ] established him as a unique comparative anatomist . " Harrison quotes from the Scottish anatomist Sir Arthur Keith 's preface to The Mechanism of the Larynx . In this preface , Negus 's 1929 work is described as showing " the same patient power of assembling observation after observation as Darwin had and some of the hot pursuit of function as urged by Hunter " . 
 = = Societies and administration = = 
 As one of the leading practitioners in his speciality , Negus served in many roles in its organisation and administration at both a national and international level . In particular , he worked closely with the Royal College of Surgeons of England , the body responsible for the accreditation and representation of surgeons practising in England and Wales , and also the organisation that supported him in his researches in comparative anatomy . The Royal College of Surgeons is located in London , and from 1939 to 1941 he was President of its <unk> Society . 
 In 1942 , Negus was President of the Section of Laryngology at the Royal Society of Medicine . When Negus had been training as a surgeon , laryngology , <unk> and <unk> had been part of general surgery , but this was changing with the advent of ENT ( ear , nose and throat ) medicine as a combined and specialised discipline . Negus and colleagues attempted to set up the necessary structure within the Royal Society of Medicine to represent their profession as an emerging speciality , but the regulations in place would not allow the type of organisation they had planned . This led them , in 1943 , to found the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists which would be able to represent ENT surgeons through the Royal College of Surgeons . Following the war , Negus was co @-@ opted to the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1947 , and was the first to represent otolaryngology at that level . He was also a member of the college 's Court of Examiners , and worked to set up the first examination in <unk> that could be taken for the FRCS diploma . This reorganisation was taking place against a background of immense change in how medicine was practised in the UK , due to the advent of the National Health Service ( NHS ) . Negus 's colleague , Geoffrey Bateman , writing in 1974 , credits him with having the foresight to represent the interests of otolaryngology and see it established as a major speciality in its own right within the NHS . 
 Negus became President of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists in 1951 , and this was one of a number of presidencies he held , including that of the Thoracic Society ( 1949 – 50 ) and the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology . The latter was a large event that took place in London over a week in July 1949 . It was held in the Great Hall of King 's College , London , and was attended by over 700 otolaryngology specialists from 39 countries . The patron was King George VI and the congress was opened by the Duchess of Kent . Negus was President and host for the 1954 annual meeting of the Collegium Oto @-@ rhino @-@ <unk> <unk> Sacrum ( <unk> ) , held in London from 29 August to 1 September , and was the treasurer of <unk> from 1936 to 1950 . Negus was also associated with , and gave talks to , numerous medical societies in the UK and abroad , with his connections ranging from honorary fellowships to corresponding and honorary memberships . These foreign societies included the American Broncho @-@ <unk> Association , and the countries included Sweden , Denmark , Canada , the USA , Austria , France , Italy , Hungary , and Turkey . Bateman opined in his obituary of Negus that it seemed unlikely that any other British ENT surgeon " has been honoured by so many societies " . 
 Following his retirement , Negus continued his involvement with the Royal College of Surgeons , becoming a trustee ( and later chairman of the trustees ) of the Hunterian Collection , the same collection that included the specimens that had underpinned his research some thirty years earlier . He also published books on the history of the college and its collections : The History of the Trustees of the Hunterian Collection ( 1965 ) ; and The Artistic Possessions at the Royal College of Surgeons of England ( 1968 ) .

 In his later years , Negus received many awards and honours . In 1945 , he was made a Fellow of King 's College , London . On 25 July 1949 , he received the honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh . Further tributes followed as an honorary Doctor of Science ( D.Sc. ) was conferred on him on 17 May 1950 by the University of Manchester . Back in London , the Royal Society of Medicine made him an honorary fellow in 1954 . Two years later , Negus was made a knight bachelor with the investiture taking place at Buckingham Palace on 7 February 1956 . On 28 August 1958 , it was the turn of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to bestow their honorary fellowship on him . In addition to these awards , Negus continued to give lectures , including an Erasmus Wilson demonstration awarded by the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1953 , and the Johns Hopkins Lecture on 30 April 1957 . Negus also received the 1963 Gould Award from the William and Harriet Gould Foundation of Chicago , USA , " for his monumental contributions to the science of laryngology " . 
 On 13 February 1969 , Negus and two others ( Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade ) were presented with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England . This award , which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony , is presented for " liberal acts or distinguished labours , researches and discoveries , eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art . " The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins , the President of the Royal College of Surgeons , who paid tribute to Negus : " Sir Victor Negus is perhaps the most distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co @-@ opted member . He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist , whose labours earned him the Lister Medal , a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense . " Atkins also paid tribute to Negus 's wife , Lady Negus , who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat @-@ of @-@ arms . Responding , Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921 , concluding : " I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done , and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on . I would also like to thank you for inviting my wife to be here to @-@ day ; she has taken a great part in all I have done . " 
 Negus died in Hindhead , Surrey , on 15 July 1974 , at the age of 87 , survived by his wife and children . Negus 's status in the history of laryngology in the UK was remarked on in his obituary in The Times , which stated that he " made a worthy fourth to Morell Mackenzie , Felix Semon , and St Clair Thomson " . Obituaries also appeared in a range of medical journals . In due course , biographical entries appeared in volume 6 of Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of England ( 1988 ) and in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ( 2004 ) . Two photographic portraits of Negus are held in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London . As well as archives relating to Negus , the Royal College of Surgeons of England houses in its one of its reserve collections ( the Hunterian Museum Collection ) over 200 sagittal sections of animals dissected by him . Additional collections of bisected animal heads prepared by Negus are held at the Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in London .

 = = Early life = = 
 Berry was born Maria Halle Berry ; her name was legally changed to Halle Maria Berry at age five . Her parents selected her middle name from Halle 's Department Store , which was then a local landmark in her birthplace of Cleveland , Ohio . Her mother , Judith Ann ( née Hawkins ) , who is of English and German ancestry , was a psychiatric nurse . Her father , Jerome Jesse Berry , was an African @-@ American hospital attendant in the psychiatric ward where her mother worked ; he later became a bus driver . Berry 's maternal grandmother , Nellie <unk> , was born in Sawley , Derbyshire , England , while her maternal grandfather , Earl Ellsworth Hawkins , was born in Ohio . Berry 's parents divorced when she was four years old ; she and her older sister , Heidi Berry @-@ Henderson , were raised exclusively by their mother . 
 Berry has said in published reports that she has been estranged from her father since her childhood , noting in 1992 , " I haven 't heard from him since [ he left ] . Maybe he 's not alive . " Her father was very abusive to her mother . Berry has recalled witnessing her mother being beaten daily , kicked down stairs and hit in the head with a wine bottle . 
 Berry graduated from Bedford High School where she was a cheerleader , honor student , editor of the school newspaper and prom queen . She worked in the children 's department at <unk> 's Department store . She then studied at Cuyahoga Community College . In the 1980s , she entered several beauty contests , winning Miss Teen All American in 1985 and Miss Ohio USA in 1986 . She was the 1986 Miss USA first runner @-@ up to Christy Fichtner of Texas . In the Miss USA 1986 pageant interview competition , she said she hoped to become an entertainer or to have something to do with the media . Her interview was awarded the highest score by the judges . She was the first African @-@ American Miss World entrant in 1986 , where she finished sixth and Trinidad and Tobago 's Giselle <unk> was crowned Miss World . According to the Current Biography Yearbook , Berry " ... pursued a modeling career in Chicago .... Berry 's first weeks in New York were less than auspicious : She slept in a homeless shelter and then in a WMCA " .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 In 1989 , Berry moved to New York City to pursue her acting ambitions . During her early time there , she ran out of money and had to live briefly in a homeless shelter . 
 Later in 1989 , her situation improved and she was cast in the role of model Emily Franklin in the short @-@ lived ABC television series Living Dolls , which was shot in New York and was a spin @-@ off of the hit series Who 's the Boss ? . During the taping of Living Dolls , she lapsed into a coma and was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes . After the cancellation of Living Dolls , she moved to Los Angeles . She went on to have a recurring role on the long @-@ running primetime serial Knots Landing . 
 Her film debut was in a small role for Spike Lee 's Jungle Fever ( 1991 ) , in which she played Vivian , a drug addict . That same year , Berry had her first co @-@ starring role in Strictly Business . In 1992 , Berry portrayed a career woman who falls for the lead character played by Eddie Murphy in the romantic comedy Boomerang . The following year , she caught the public 's attention as a headstrong biracial slave in the TV adaptation of Queen : The Story of an American Family , based on the book by Alex Haley .

 She starred alongside Natalie <unk> Reid in the 1997 comedy film B * A * P * S. In 1998 , Berry received praise for her role in Bulworth as an intelligent woman raised by activists who gives a politician ( Warren Beatty ) a new lease on life . The same year , she played the singer Zola Taylor , one of the three wives of pop singer Frankie Lymon , in the biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love . In the 1999 HBO biopic Introducing Dorothy Dandridge , she portrayed the first black woman to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award , and it was to Berry a heart @-@ felt project that she introduced , co @-@ produced and fought intensely for it to come through . Berry 's performance was recognized with several awards , including an Emmy and a Golden Globe . 
 Berry portrayed the mutant superhero Storm in the film adaptation of the comic book series X @-@ Men ( 2000 ) and its sequels , X2 : X @-@ Men United ( 2003 ) , X @-@ Men : The Last Stand ( 2006 ) and X @-@ Men : Days of Future Past ( 2014 ) . In 2001 , Berry appeared in the film Swordfish , which featured her first topless scene . At first , she refused to be filmed topless in a sunbathing scene , but she changed her mind when Warner Brothers raised her fee substantially . The brief flash of her breasts added $ 500 @,@ 000 to her fee . Berry considered these stories to be rumors and was quick to deny them . After turning down numerous roles that required nudity , she said she decided to make Swordfish because her then @-@ husband , Eric Benét , supported her and encouraged her to take risks . 
 She appeared as Leticia Musgrove , the troubled wife of an executed murderer ( Sean Combs ) , in the 2001 feature film Monster 's Ball . Her performance was awarded the National Board of Review and the Screen Actors Guild best @-@ actress prizes ; in an interesting coincidence she became the first woman of color to win the Academy Award for Best Actress ( earlier in her career , she portrayed Dorothy Dandridge , the first African American to be nominated for Best Actress , and who was born at the same hospital as Berry , in Cleveland , Ohio ) . The NAACP issued the statement : " Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud . If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing . " This role generated controversy . Her graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co @-@ star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African Americans . Many in the African @-@ American community were critical of Berry for taking the part . Berry responded : " I don 't really see a reason to ever go that far again . That was a unique movie . That scene was special and pivotal and needed to be there , and it would be a really special script that would require something like that again . " 
 Berry asked for a higher fee for Revlon advertisements after winning the Academy Award . Ron Perelman , the cosmetics firm 's chief , congratulated her , saying how happy he was that she modeled for his company . She replied , " Of course , you 'll have to pay me more . " Perelman stalked off in a rage . Her win at the Academy Awards led to two famous " Oscar moments . " In accepting her award , she gave an acceptance speech honoring previous black actresses who had never had the opportunity . She said , " This moment is so much bigger than me . This is for every nameless , faceless woman of colour who now has a chance tonight because this door has been opened . " One year later , as she presented the Best Actor award , winner Adrien Brody ran on stage and , instead of giving her the standard peck on the cheek , planted a long kiss on Berry . 
 As Bond girl <unk> ' Jinx ' Johnson in the 2002 blockbuster Die Another Day , Berry recreated a scene from Dr. No , emerging from the surf to be greeted by James Bond as Ursula Andress had 40 years earlier . Lindy Hemming , costume designer on Die Another Day , had insisted that Berry wear a bikini and knife as a homage . Berry has said of the scene : " It 's splashy " , " exciting " , " sexy " , " provocative " and " it will keep me still out there after winning an Oscar " . The bikini scene was shot in Cadiz ; the location was reportedly cold and windy , and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels in between takes to try to stay warm . According to an ITV news poll , Jinx was voted the fourth toughest girl on screen of all time . Berry was hurt during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye . It was removed in a 30 @-@ minute operation . After Berry won the Academy Award , rewrites were commissioned to give her more screentime for X2 . 
 She starred in the psychological thriller Gothika opposite Robert Downey , Jr. in November 2003 , during which she broke her arm in a scene with Downey , who twisted her arm too hard . Production was halted for eight weeks . It was a moderate hit at the United States box office , taking in $ 60 million ; it earned another $ 80 million abroad . Berry appeared in the nu metal band Limp Bizkit 's music video for " Behind Blue Eyes " for the motion picture soundtrack for the film . The same year , she was named # 1 in FHM 's 100 Sexiest Women in the World poll .

 Berry received $ 12 @.@ 5 million for the title role in the film Catwoman , a $ 100 million movie ; it grossed $ 17 million on its first weekend . She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role . She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person ( making her the third person , and second actor , ever to do so ) with a sense of humor , considering it an experience of the " rock bottom " in order to be " at the top " . Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said , " I never in my life thought that I would be here , winning a Razzie . It 's not like I ever aspired to be here , but thank you . When I was a kid , my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser , then there 's no way you could be a good winner . " The Fund for Animals praised Berry 's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a " pet . " 
 Her next film appearance was in the Oprah Winfrey @-@ produced ABC television movie Their Eyes Were Watching God ( 2005 ) , an adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston 's novel , in which Berry portrayed Janie Crawford , a free @-@ spirited woman whose unconventional sexual mores upset her 1920s contemporaries in a small community .

 According to Berry , a beating from a former abusive boyfriend during the filming of The Last Boy Scout punctured her eardrum and caused her to lose eighty percent of her hearing in her left ear . Berry has never named the abuser but has said that he is someone well known in Hollywood . 
 Berry first saw baseball player David Justice on TV playing in an MTV celebrity baseball game in February 1992 . When a reporter from Justice 's hometown of Cincinnati told her that Justice was a fan , Berry gave her phone number to the reporter to give to Justice . Berry married Justice shortly after midnight on January 1 , 1993 . 
 Following their separation in February 1996 , Berry stated publicly that she was so depressed that she considered taking her own life . Berry and Justice were officially divorced on June 24 , 1997 . 
 Berry married her second husband , singer @-@ songwriter Eric Benét , on January 24 , 2001 , following a two @-@ year <unk> but by early October 2003 they had separated , with the divorce finalized on January 3 , 2005 . Benét underwent treatment for sex addiction in 2002 .

Aubry objected to the move on the grounds that it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement . In November 2012 , a judge denied Berry 's request to move the couple 's daughter to France in light of Aubry 's objections . Less than two weeks later , on November 22 , 2012 , Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry 's residence . Martinez performed a citizen 's arrest on Aubry , and because it was considered a domestic violence incident , was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry , Martinez , the child with whom he shares custody with Berry , until November 29 , 2012 . In turn , Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26 , 2012 , asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France . Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry 's face , which were widely displayed in the media . 
 On November 29 , 2012 , Berry 's lawyer announced that Berry and Aubry had reached an amicable custody agreement in court . In June 2014 , a Superior Court ruling called for Berry to pay Aubry $ 16 @,@ 000 a month in child support ( around <unk> / year ) as well as a retroactive payment of $ 115 @,@ 000 and a sum of $ 300 @,@ 000 for Aubry 's attorney fees .

 " Things Aren 't Simple Any More " is the final episode of the British television sitcom One Foot in the Grave . It was written by David Renwick and stars Richard Wilson as Victor Meldrew , Annette Crosbie as his wife Margaret , and features a guest appearance by Hannah Gordon . The episode depicts the death of the series ' protagonist , Victor Meldrew , in a hit @-@ and @-@ run road accident , and his wife 's efforts to deal with the driver who killed him . Renwick had been struggling to conceive and write new stories for the series and decided to kill off the character . The episode was filmed at Shawford , Hampshire , and at BBC Television Centre in London . 
 Renwick resisted the BBC 's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas , feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show , and would be viewed as an overt attempt to garner high ratings . The controller of BBC1 relented and the episode was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000 . The broadcast coincided with the transmission of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? ' s first UK jackpot win . Some people within the BBC alleged that Celador , the production company in charge of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? had rigged Judith Keppel 's victory to spoil the BBC 's expected high ratings for the sitcom 's finale . The Independent Television Commission ( ITC ) cleared Celador and ITV of any wrongdoing . 
 The critical reception for the episode was mostly positive . Many reviewers commented that the dark tone of the final episode was characteristic of the series , and that killing off the protagonist was an appropriate way to conclude . The characters of Victor and Margaret returned in a short sketch for Comic Relief 's Red Nose Day telethon on 16 March 2001 . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Margaret ( Annette Crosbie ) is having a heated telephone conversation with a solicitor about an incident in which Victor is accused of having thrown a syringe into someone 's buttock . She reveals that a conviction might be difficult as her husband has been dead for five months . While coming to terms with her husband 's death as a hit and run victim , Margaret joins a church group clearing litter from roadsides . There she meets Glynis Holloway ( Hannah Gordon ) , whose husband has also recently died . The two become good friends . <unk> to a priest , Father Blakey ( William Osborne ) , Margaret pledges vengeance for Victor 's death , vowing " If they ever find the bastard who was at the wheel of that car I swear I 'll kill him , with my bare hands if I have to , and they can do what they like with me " . 
 The episode continually switches to flashbacks which show that the circumstances leading to Victor 's death stemmed from a simple misunderstanding . A group of pilgrims descend upon the Meldrews ' home after misunderstanding Margaret 's classified advertisement in her local newspaper of a picture of the Virgin Mary with " two small tears under her eyes " . Readers apparently took it to mean ' tears ' ( as in crying ) rather than ' tears ' ( as in rips ) . As a result of their exposure in the local paper , Victor is contacted by an old acquaintance and invited to a works reunion . Victor , who is persuaded to go by Margaret , is informed by the barman ( Paul Merton ) that all but one of the other guests have cancelled . Sitting alone while waiting for Limpy , the one remaining potential attendee , Victor is entertained by two cabaret performers ( Ed Welch — who wrote the incidental music for all series — and Jean Challis ) . Victor eventually leaves the pub , with Limpy arriving seconds after he leaves . At the railway station Victor telephones Margaret for a lift . As he stands at the side of the road waiting for his wife , Glynis approaches in her car . She begins to fall asleep and mounts the kerb ; Victor is knocked down . She stops and looks back from a short distance , but decides not to return to the scene when she sees Margaret arrive . 
 The episode returns to the present day . Margaret prepares some orange juice and paracetamol for Glynis ' migraine . She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor 's death in Glynis ' kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise . As ominous music plays , Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol . She drops some tablets into the glass and hands it to Glynis , who realises that her secret has been uncovered . Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house . The number of tablets that Margaret put into the glass is intentionally left ambiguous . Before Margaret leaves , Glynis explains exactly what happened that night and tells Margaret how sorry she is . Margaret is then seen leaving the house , never revealing what happened next . 
 The episode ends with a montage of some of the events referred to during the episode , accompanied by the song " End of the Line " by The Traveling Wilburys . Scenes include Victor and his car being covered in artificial snow at a supermarket during the filming of a Christmas television advertisement ( in the middle of June ) ; Victor scaring a young couple after grass cuttings are stuck in the sunscreen on his face ; and the incident with the syringe . The final shots are of Victor and Margaret driving through the countryside .

 David Renwick found writing the fifth series and the 1997 Christmas special " Endgame " difficult , and he was becoming increasingly busy with his detective series Jonathan Creek . In early 1998 , his concerns appeared in the national press . The Evening Standard quoted him : " I have no new ideas for Victor Meldrew ... I know that if I tried to write another series it would be even harder than the Christmas one . I don 't want the standard to drop [ and ] there would be no point in doing something I didn 't believe in . " A year later , Renwick agreed to write a final series of One Foot , having found the four @-@ year break after writing the fifth series fruitful . Renwick decided that Victor should die in the final episode because he did not want to be persuaded to write another series . He cites the final episode of the Only Fools and Horses 1996 Christmas specials " where the fantastic closing scenes of the Trilogy saw the Trotters walking up the Yellow Brick Road , only for them to return a couple of years later " . He did not want to be constantly asked by journalists and fans when Victor was coming back to their screens . 
 In June 1999 , while Richard Wilson was performing in Waiting for Godot at the Royal Exchange in Manchester , Renwick informed him of his decision to kill off Victor . The actor reacted positively , and said in 2006 that he did not want Victor to " take me over . " Wilson had noticed that " the scripts weren 't as original as they had been " and that he was " getting a bit tired of the character , trying to maintain a freshness " . Annette Crosbie was saddened that the show was coming to an end because she enjoyed working on it , but she understood Renwick 's feelings of being pressured to " top the last one " . 
 In an interview for the documentary Comedy Connections , Renwick says that killing off the protagonist " seemed to be the most natural and logical and appropriate end for the character in a show where we had tried to reflect the truthfulness of real life . " Victor 's demise had been announced in the press in the summer preceding the broadcast . In an interview with The Sun , Wilson said " I feel sad , of course , but it 's the right time . To keep doing it would have got dull " . 
 Renwick decided to use the flashback structure for several reasons . He felt that the episode should be about " life After Victor , which I think will be more interesting and not the route people are expecting you to take . " He realised that most viewers would have been aware of Victor 's death because of the press coverage ; there would be little point in having the death be the climax of the episode because everyone already knew the outcome . However , the focus would be upon Victor 's death rather than the details of the accident . Renwick 's decision to kill Victor in a road accident was fuelled by the writer 's concerns about reckless driving . Also , the suddenness of an accident , as opposed to death by illness , would not negate the comic tone of the rest of the episode . The twist that the person responsible for Victor 's death is Margaret 's new best friend was designed to add some complexity to the show . 
 Actress Hannah Gordon , who played the culprit of Victor 's demise , admired the tone of the script . Her character was returning from visiting her terminally ill husband in hospital , which distracted her concentration from the road , " but her guilt and conscience is something from which she can 't escape . " Commenting upon the ambiguity of whether or not Margaret kills Glynis by overdosing her orange juice with tablets , Renwick believes it to be more stimulating to allow audiences to reach their own conclusions . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The five previous series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin . She had retired because of ill health . Renwick persuaded her to return to work on the final series to provide continuity , but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again . The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon . Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon 's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant , as well as on other shows , meant that her style was similar to Belbin 's , which would aid the transition between directors . 
 The cast and crew assembled in the Bridge Lounge at the BBC Television Centre for the read @-@ through of all six episodes from the final series on 30 June 2000 . Nine days later they moved to Bournemouth to film some exterior sequences . One Foot had used Bournemouth since the show 's beginning because of its favourable climate , easy access to London , and lower costs compared to filming in the capital . The exterior scenes of the Meldrews ' home were filmed , as they had been since series two , at Tresillian Way in Walkford ( a village near New Milton in Hampshire ) . 
 Victor 's death scene was filmed outside The Bridge Hotel and pub at Shawford railway bridge , next to the River Itchen , Hampshire , on 21 July 2000 . The cold temperature on the night of the shoot and the various technical considerations meant that the scene did not have a big emotional impact upon the cast and crew during filming . However , Renwick briefly felt emotional as he watched Victor 's arm falling into the shot and his cap drift away in the gutter . After the exterior sequences had been filmed , the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000 . Unlike the location shoot , Renwick was too concerned with the complexities of filming to be emotionally affected by the filming of the final episode . 
 = = Broadcast = = 
 The BBC originally wanted to transmit the episode at Christmas , a time of year when audience figures are particularly important for broadcasters . Renwick was unhappy with the plan , writing in his journal in May 2000 : 
 It 's almost as if , as broadcasters , we are <unk> his death . The context a show is presented in will have a huge impact on how it is received , and it 's always been our policy to swim against the tide and resist the policy to conform . It seems ironic — and depressing — to me that after deliberately avoiding the " obvious " approach in my script we are now facing a very " obvious " approach to the scheduling . If Victor dies at Christmas it 's going to look like a naked push for ratings . The opposite is true : I want Victor 's departure to be significant , but stripped of sensationalism . 
 Renwick outlined his concerns in a letter dated 19 May 2000 to Peter Salmon , the controller of BBC1 : 
 [ The show ] draws its rhythms and inspiration from reality , and occasionally has the power to disarm the viewer with material that is darker or more reflective than they are used to ... Death may be tragic but it is commonplace , the eternal Truth . Let 's not trumpet it , but place it simply before the public and let them make up their own minds . I would so like the feeling that we generate on the air to reflect the reality of death in life : most of the time it is a very quiet , private affair , generates little public attention : we grieve , and then somehow or other we just have to get on with things . I suppose at the risk of sounding <unk> precious , I would like Victor to die with dignity . 
 Salmon agreed not to broadcast the episode at Christmas . It was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000 , forty minutes in length , rather than usual thirty . The episode 's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don 't Believe It ! The One Foot In The Grave Story , a documentary presented by Angus Deayton which looked back at the hit sitcom . The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release . 
 The Meldrews returned several months later in a sketch for the Comic Relief telethon held on 16 March 2001 . The seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minute sketch , titled " Visiting Uncle Dick " , was written by Renwick and directed by Christine Gernon . It centred on Victor and Margaret 's visit to an elderly relative in hospital . Although it initially appears to be set before the final episode , the scene concludes with Victor picking up a video of the 1999 thriller film The Sixth Sense and , while commenting that he saw the ending coming , notices that Margaret is totally ignoring him , making him realize he is actually dead . Spike Milligan , who had asked for a guest part in the series , was originally cast to play the patient , but he was too ill , and the role was played by Eric Sykes . Renwick and Gernon were dissatisfied with the sketch because of the limited time they were allowed to write and film the piece . 
 = = = Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? controversy = = = 
 The transmission of the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? on rival channel ITV at the same time as the final series of One Foot led to the ratings that year being lower than for previous series . The broadcast of " Things Aren 't Simple Any More " coincided with the broadcast of the first UK jackpot win on Millionaire . The news of Judith Keppel 's win , recorded the preceding Sunday , was leaked to the press ; ITV announced Keppel 's success at a press conference on the day of broadcast . Renwick was annoyed that this would take " audience interest " away from One Foot . He said that the early announcement of the outcome of Millionaire was " naked opportunism " , and it " would have been more honorable to let the show go out in the normal way " . He pointed out that they also " killed off any element off tension or surprise in their own programme " , but " television is all about ratings " . On the night of its broadcast ITV 's Who Wants to be a Millionaire ? attracted 13 @.@ 9 million viewers ( 48 percent ) ; One Foot , which began transmission fifteen minutes later at 21 : 15 , attracted 10 @.@ 7 million ( 36 percent ) . The episode peaked at 11 @.@ 6 million viewers when it ran concurrently with its ITV rival . 
 It was alleged that Celador , the production company in charge of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? , had rigged the show to spoil the BBC 's expected high ratings for the sitcom 's finale . Wilson in particular was quoted as saying that ITV had " planned " the win , adding " it seems a bit unfair to take the audience away from Victor 's last moments on earth . " Richard Webber 's account , in his 2006 book , cites " unnamed BBC sources " as those who " questioned the authenticity of Keppel 's victory " . ITV claimed that the allegation " undermined viewers ' faith in the programme " , and Leslie Hill , ITV 's chairman , wrote a letter of complaint to Sir Christopher Bland , the chairman of the BBC Board of Governors . The corporation apologised , saying that any suggestion of rigging " did not represent the official view of the BBC . " Eleven viewers complained about the quiz show to the Independent Television Commission ( ITC ) , but Millionaire was cleared of any wrongdoing .

 Many reviewers commented that the dark tone of the final episode was typical of the series . A reviewer for BBC Comedy said that it " was a characteristically dark end to a show which was never afraid to explore the flip side of the comedy coin . " UKTV Gold 's website says " it was a suitably downbeat end to an equally downbeat man . " Commenting that killing off the protagonist " might seem an odd way for a sitcom to end , " the British Film Institute 's <unk> says that in a series " where comedy and tragedy are so intertwined , it seems entirely appropriate . " 
 The Daily Telegraph described the episode as displaying " an exhilarating flair for rapid change of comic gear " and commented positively on the scene in which pilgrims descend on the Meldrews ' home . Rupert Smith in The Guardian called the episode " a satisfying ending to a series that never went out of its way to be cheerful " , referring in particular to the open @-@ ended scene of Margaret dropping the paracetamol into the glass . However , The Independent 's Robert Hanks criticised the transitions into the flashbacks for being " clumsily signalled " , and said that the direction and score of the paracetamol scene was not equal to the quality of the writing and acting . 
 Victor Meldrew had become such a cultural icon that many fans left messages and flowers at the location of his death . Fans repeated this on the first anniversary of his screen death , although Renwick suspects that the event was orchestrated by the tabloid press .

Then , it started to look like milk . ″ 
 As a freshman Youngblood played defensive end , wearing number 52 , for the Gator freshman team . It was his first experience on the defensive line , after playing linebacker in high school . As a sophomore , Youngblood played defensive end and defensive tackle ( recording 24 tackles and 4 sacks ) while also handling the kicking chores for the Gators , kicking a career @-@ long 42 @-@ yard field goal to provide the three @-@ point winning margin in his first collegiate game which was against Air Force . 
 In 1969 , Youngblood was part of a 9 – 1 – 1 Gators team that upset the Tennessee Volunteers in the Gator Bowl in coach Ray Graves 's final game as coach at Florida .

 Youngblood was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the first round of the 1971 NFL Draft . He was the 20th overall pick in that draft and signed a 3 @-@ year $ 105 @,@ 000 contract including a $ 30 @,@ 000 signing bonus . That season he backed up Deacon Jones at left defensive end and started four games when Jones was sidelined with a severely sprained arch . He was named All @-@ Rookie by Football Digest and after the season Jones was traded to the San Diego Chargers . In 1972 the left defensive end position was Youngblood 's as he led the Rams defensive linemen in tackles with 70 , and started 11 of the 14 games he played , recording six sacks . 
 In 1973 Youngblood was a Second @-@ team All @-@ pro selection and went to the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16 ½ sacks . The Ram defense led the NFL in fewest yards allowed and fewest rushing yards . He was voted the Rams defensive lineman of the year by the Rams Alumni Association . Beginning in the 1973 season , the Rams added the unrelated Jim Youngblood to its roster , so from that time on , both <unk> had the unique distinction of having their entire name on the back of their jerseys , the given name appearing above the family name . The following year , 1974 , the Rams again led the NFL in rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First @-@ team All @-@ Pro . The Rams advanced to the NFC Championship game , losing 14 @-@ 10 to the Minnesota Vikings . 
 Youngblood was honored as the NFC Defensive Player of the Year by United Press International in 1975 and Pro Football Weekly named Youngblood the NFL defensive lineman of the year . For the third consecutive season Youngblood led the Rams in sacks ( 15 ) and was a consensus All @-@ pro again , repeating his 1974 honor . In a December , 1975 , 35 @-@ 23 playoff win over the St. Louis Cardinals , Youngblood pass @-@ rushed Cardinals offensive lineman Dan <unk> , penetrated into the backfield , then tipped and intercepted a pass by Jim Hart , returning the interception 47 yards for a touchdown . Later in the game , Youngblood forced a fumble that was recovered by teammate Fred Dryer , blocked an extra point attempt , and sacked Hart to stop a Cardinals drive . 
 Youngblood repeated his NFC Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1976 while co @-@ leading the Rams in sacks with 14 ½ and being a consensus first @-@ team All @-@ Pro for the third straight season . The following year , 1977 , Youngblood was voted to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl and a consensus All @-@ NFC selection and second @-@ team All @-@ Pro while leading the Rams in sacks for the fifth straight season . In 1978 the Rams led the NFL in total defense and Youngblood was a consensus first @-@ team All @-@ Pro for the fourth time in five years . 
 One of the athletic feats for which Youngblood is best known , is that of playing the entire 1979 playoffs , including Super Bowl XIV , with a fractured left fibula . He also played in the 1980 Pro Bowl with the injured leg , a week after the Super Bowl . In the playoffs , Youngblood sacked Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach near the sideline in the waning moments of the divisional playoff game versus the Cowboys . Playing with the fractured leg was noted by Sports Illustrated in their Top 10 list of athletes playing in pain . For that and other achievements Jack was dubbed the " John Wayne of football " by Jim <unk> and echoed by Hall of Fame coach John Madden . The NFL Network series NFL Top 10 selected Youngblood 's performance in the 1979 playoffs as top on its list of the " Gutsiest Performances ″ of all @-@ time . 
 For the 1979 season Youngblood had a career @-@ high 18 sacks and was a consensus first @-@ team All @-@ Pro for the fifth time . He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl . In 1980 he was second @-@ team All @-@ Pro and first @-@ team All @-@ NFC while leading the Rams with 11 ½ sacks . In 1981 Youngblood led the Rams with 12 ½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman . In the off @-@ season , prior to the 1981 season , Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot @-@ dog sized blood clot from under his left arm . It was a result of repeated trauma to a nerve in his arm that blocked the flow of blood . Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries , Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games , a Rams team record ; and only missed one game in his 14 @-@ year NFL career . He played in seven straight Pro Bowls , five NFC Championships , and one Super Bowl . He was also the Rams defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times , which is awarded to the team 's MVP . He had 151 ½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi 's stop @-@ the @-@ run @-@ first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur 's 3 @-@ 4 two @-@ gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent 's running game was handled . 
 Youngblood faced a challenge in 1983 when the Rams adopted Shurmur 's 3 @-@ 4 defense . Critics thought Youngblood might be too small to play that position , yet he performed in it well ( recording 10 ½ sacks in 1983 and 9 ½ sacks in 1984 while Rams were among the NFL 's best defenses at stopping the run ) despite being considered undersized . Among the standout games in Youngblood 's final two seasons were the opening game of the 1983 season , against the New York Giants in which Youngblood recorded two sacks ; and the 1983 season finale against the New Orleans Saints . In the Saints game Youngblood recorded 10 tackles , two sacks , recorded a safety and was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by Pro Football Weekly for the effort . In Week 5 of 1984 against the New York Giants , Youngblood recorded two sacks , drew three holding calls and was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week by the NFL . Then , in Week 10 , against the St. Louis Cardinals , Jack dominated the game sacking Neil Lomax three times and drawing three holding calls , and blocking a potential game @-@ tying field goal on the game 's final play to preserve a 16 @-@ 13 Rams win . 
 His streak of consecutive games played ended in Week 15 of the 1984 season , when Youngblood had to sit out his first football game since being a collegiate player in 1970 . He had suffered a ruptured disc in his lower back two weeks earlier . Despite the injury , he returned for the season finale against the 49ers and the playoffs . He attributed his ability to play to a series of back adjustments that allowed him more freedom of movement , even though team doctors told Youngblood he was out for the season and needed surgery . He was voted the Rams ' recipient of the 1984 Ed Block Courage Award by " representing everything that is positive about professional football and serving as an inspiration in their locker rooms being a positive role model in his communities " . Though the injury ended his streak , Youngblood still holds the record for most consecutive starts in the NFL by a strong @-@ side defensive end with 184 . 
 When Youngblood retired on August 27 , 1985 , he asked his career to be remembered for " dignity , integrity , respect and pride ″ .

 Youngblood 's style of play and perceived ability to play hurt brought many notations in NFL lore .

Youngblood concluded , " I wasn ’ t the biggest guy , I certainly wasn ’ t the strongest and I wasn ’ t the fastest either .

 = Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes = 
 Wimbledon Football Club relocated to Milton Keynes in September 2003 , 16 months after receiving permission to do so from an independent commission appointed by the Football Association . The move took the team from south London , where it had been based since its foundation in 1889 , to Milton Keynes , a new town in Buckinghamshire , about 56 miles ( 90 km ) to the northwest of the club 's traditional home district Wimbledon . Hugely controversial , the move 's authorisation prompted disaffected Wimbledon supporters to form AFC Wimbledon , a new club , in June 2002 . The relocated team played home matches in Milton Keynes under the Wimbledon name from September 2003 until June 2004 , when following the end of the 2003 – 04 season it renamed itself Milton Keynes Dons F.C. ( MK Dons ) . 
 Wimbledon F.C. spent most of its history in non @-@ League football before being elected to the Football League in 1977 . A series of club owners believed that its long @-@ term potential was limited by its home ground at Plough Lane , which never changed significantly from the team 's non @-@ League days . Meanwhile , the Milton Keynes Development Corporation envisaged a stadium in the town hosting top @-@ flight football and was keen on the idea of an established League team relocating there . The Wimbledon chairman Ron Noades briefly explored moving Wimbledon to Milton Keynes in 1979 , but decided it would not lead to larger crowds . Charlton Athletic briefly mooted a relocation in 1973 , and in the 1980s the Milton Keynes Development Corporation offered a new ground to Luton Town , who almost became " MK Hatters " . 
 Wimbledon rose through the professional divisions unusually rapidly in what has been called a " fairytale " , and by the end of the 1980s were playing at the top of the English game . In 1991 , after the Taylor Report ordered the redevelopment of English football grounds , the team entered a groundshare at Crystal Palace 's Selhurst Park stadium , about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) east of Plough Lane . This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement while the Wimbledon chairman Sam Hammam sought a new stadium site in south @-@ west London , but this search proved frustratingly long , both for Hammam and the club 's fans . Much to the anger of most Wimbledon supporters , Hammam proposed new locations for the team outside London , including the Irish capital Dublin . He sold the club to two Norwegian businessmen , Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten , in 1997 and the following year sold Plough Lane for a supermarket redevelopment . 
 Starting in 2000 a consortium led by Pete Winkelman proposed a large retail development in Milton Keynes including a Football League @-@ standard stadium , and offered this site to Luton , Wimbledon , Barnet , Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers . Røkke and Gjelsten appointed a new chairman , Charles Koppel , who announced on 2 August 2001 that Wimbledon intended to relocate to Milton Keynes . Koppel said the club would otherwise go out of business . After the League refused permission , Koppel launched an appeal , leading to an FA arbitration hearing and subsequently the appointment of a three @-@ man independent commission by the FA in May 2002 to make a final and binding verdict . The League and FA stated opposition but the commissioners ruled in favour , two to one . The vast majority of the team 's fans switched allegiance to AFC Wimbledon in protest . Wimbledon F.C. ' s relocation was delayed for over a year by the lack of an interim ground in Milton Keynes meeting Football League standards . In June 2003 the club went into administration ; Winkelman 's consortium injected funds to keep it operating and paid for the renovation of the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes , where the team played its first match in September 2003 . Winkelman 's Inter MK Group bought the relocated club in 2004 and concurrently changed its name , badge and colours . The team 's new ground , Stadium mk , opened three years later . MK Dons initially claimed Wimbledon F.C. ' s heritage and history , but renounced this in 2007 . AFC Wimbledon received planning permission for a new ground on Plough Lane in 2015 . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Milton Keynes = = = 
 Milton Keynes , in northern Buckinghamshire , was established by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government as a new town on 23 January 1967 . Named after the village of Milton Keynes already present on the site , it was formed primarily as a London overspill settlement following the recommendations of governmental studies in 1964 and 1965 to build " a new city " in Buckinghamshire incorporating existing towns such as Bletchley , Stony Stratford and Wolverton . This site was chosen as it was equidistant from London and Birmingham , close to main roads and railways , and near Luton Airport . About 40 @,@ 000 people lived on the Milton Keynes site before 1967 ; the government set a target population of 250 @,@ 000 . 
 When Milton Keynes was founded , no football club within its boundaries was professional and none played in the Football League . The teams most advanced in the English football league system or " pyramid " were the United Counties League sides Bletchley Town and Wolverton Town & B.R. , and Stony Stratford Town of the South Midlands League ; New Bradwell St Peter and Newport Pagnell Wanderers ( Newport Pagnell Town from 1972 ) would join the South Midlands League in 1970 and 1972 respectively . Nevertheless , the Milton Keynes Development Corporation , created by the government to oversee the town 's planning and construction , envisaged a stadium in Milton Keynes capable of accommodating a top @-@ flight football team . 
 = = = Accession to the Football League ; club relocation in English football = = = 
 In English football , the relocation of teams away from their traditional districts is unusual because of the nature of the relationship between clubs and their fans : the local football club is regarded by most English football supporters as part of the local identity and social fabric rather than as a business that can be transplanted by its owners at will . As a result , any relocation plan would be strongly opposed by fans in the club 's original area , and unlikely to succeed in most new locations due to the existence of established teams in most towns and cities that would already have secured the loyalty of local football fans . John Bale , summarising a study published in 1974 , writes that , in the view of most fans , " Chelsea would simply not be Chelsea " were that club to move a few miles within the same borough to Wormwood Scrubs . 
 The geographic redistribution of the 92 Football League teams was considered a possible eventuality by some around that time , including Sir Norman Chester , who headed an investigation into the condition of English football in 1968 . Before the 1986 – 87 season , clubs could not be relegated out of the League 's Fourth Division . The bottom four clubs had to apply for re @-@ election by the other member clubs at the end of each season , alongside any non @-@ League teams who wished to take their place , but the replacement of an established League side in this way was quite rare . From the inaugural post @-@ war season ( 1946 – 47 ) through to 1985 – 86 , clubs already in the League were supplanted on only six occasions . " New communities have developed ... which lack clubs in League membership , " Chester reported , in 1968 . " <unk> of old clubs would provide vacancies for new clubs to enter the League . Alternatively the movement of established clubs to new communities could provide a way both of saving old clubs and at the same time bringing League football to new and growing areas . " Closely fitting this description , Milton Keynes provided a clear staging ground for such an experiment . 
 At the end of the 1978 – 79 season , 20 leading non @-@ League clubs left the Southern League and the Northern Premier League to form the Alliance Premier League . This national non @-@ League division started in the 1979 – 80 season ; it was called the Football Conference from 1986 to 2015 , when it became the National League . Since the 1986 – 87 season , the champions of this league have received promotion to the Football League , with the League 's bottom club being relegated in exchange . This was expanded to the Conference champions and the winners of a promotion play @-@ off before the 2002 – 03 season , with the worst two Football League clubs being relegated . The situation of the Football League " closed shop " , which for nearly a century effectively barred most non @-@ League clubs from accession , therefore no longer exists . Any club in the English football pyramid ( which also includes some clubs from Wales ) can potentially win enough promotions to reach the Football League or the Premier League , the separate top division formed in 1992 . 
 = = = = Precursors in Scottish and English football = = = = 
 According to the Football League 's statement to the independent commission on Wimbledon F.C. in May 2002 , the English League " had allowed temporary relocations for good reasons outside ' conurbations ' in respect of certain clubs where it was intended the club would return , but there has been no previous occasion on which the Football League had granted permission to a club to relocate permanently to a ground outside its ' conurbation ' . " Clubs in the English professional ranks that have relocated to other locales within their traditional conurbations include Manchester United and Woolwich Arsenal , who moved 5 miles ( 8 km ) and 10 miles ( 16 km ) respectively in 1910 and 1913 . South Shields of the Third Division North relocated 8 miles ( 13 km ) west to Gateshead in 1930 and renamed themselves Gateshead A.F.C .. The commission reported that there was no Football League precedent for a move between conurbations , but stressed that there was direct precedent for such a move in Scotland . 
 Promotion and relegation in and out of the Scottish Professional Football League was not introduced until the league system 's reorganisation in 2014 ; until then it was nearly impossible for sides outside the League to join . Scottish League membership therefore remained largely restricted to well @-@ established cities as opposed to new towns . Two Scottish League teams left their metropolitan districts for new towns during the 1990s . Third @-@ flight club Clyde moved from Shawfield Stadium ( close to Rutherglen in the south @-@ east of Glasgow ) to the new town of Cumbernauld , about 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the north @-@ east , in 1994 , and a year later Meadowbank Thistle , a struggling Edinburgh club in the fourth tier , relocated amid fans ' protests about 20 miles ( 32 km ) west to another new town , Livingston . Clyde kept their original name , while Meadowbank renamed themselves Livingston Football Club . 
 In English non @-@ League football , events surrounding Enfield F.C. have been latterly described as mirroring what was to occur at Wimbledon . Enfield 's owner Tony Lazarou sold the club 's ground at <unk> Road in 1999 and arranged several short @-@ term <unk> before resettling Enfield 10 miles ( 16 km ) west in Borehamwood — temporarily , he said , while he looked for a new stadium in Enfield . Two years later , after no site had been identified and a dispute had developed regarding an escrow account , the Enfield Supporters ' Trust resolved in June 2001 that Lazarou lacked sufficient will to bring the club back to Enfield and so founded a new team , Enfield Town , which based itself locally and won the support of much of the original Enfield fanbase . In a similar case in 2012 , the supporters ' trust affiliated to Northwich Victoria broke away to form 1874 Northwich . In each of these cases , Stephen Mumford comments in his 2013 work Watching Sport : Aesthetics , Ethics and Emotion , " supporters have agonised over where their allegiance properly lies . "

The <unk> family , which owned Charlton from 1932 to 1982 and had a history of proposing elaborate schemes for the club , revealed plans to build a community sports complex at The Valley , and to hold a public market at the ground on weekdays . Greenwich Council refused to licence the market and insisted that the complex be built on public space at a local park . The club reacted by announcing the proposed move to the Midlands . Fans inundated the local media and club offices with strong opinion against a move , prompting Charlton to print a statement in the 14 April 1973 match programme telling fans that the proposed move was because of the council 's attitude regarding the market and complex plans , which the team said threatened its future . " You , the supporters , can make sure the club continues in Charlton by protesting as loud as you can to Greenwich Council over their refusal to grant us permission for our plans , " the message explained . No relocation occurred . 
 = = = Wimbledon ( 1979 ) = = = 
 The south @-@ west London club Wimbledon , traditionally a semi @-@ professional non @-@ League side , won three successive Southern League championships between 1975 and 1977 and were thereupon elected into the Football League . Nicknamed " the Dons " , they proceeded to perform strongly in fully professional football , winning promotion to the then @-@ top flight First Division for the 1986 – 87 season . The club 's swift " fairytale " rise from obscurity through the English football pyramid caused it to reach a level of prominence far above that suggested by its modest home stadium at Plough Lane , which remained largely unchanged from the club 's non @-@ League days . Wimbledon 's record attendance at Plough Lane — 18 @,@ 000 , set " in the 1930s against a team of sailors from HMS Victory " — was never broken during 14 League seasons at the ground , including five in the top flight . 
 Ron Noades , who purchased the club for £ 2 @,@ 782 in 1976 , came to see Plough Lane as a potential limitation by 1979 . He surmised that it could only attract a relatively small number of fans because of its location , close to large areas of sparsely populated parkland . Noades 's interest was piqued by the site the Milton Keynes Development Corporation had earmarked for a stadium next to the town 's still @-@ under @-@ construction Central railway station . " They were very keen to get a Football League club , effectively a franchise if you like , into Milton Keynes to take up that site , " Noades said in a 2001 interview . Planning to move Wimbledon there by amalgamating with an established Milton Keynes club , Noades purchased debt @-@ ridden Southern League club Milton Keynes City ( MK City ; formerly Bletchley Town ) for £ 1 . He and three other Wimbledon directors — Jimmy Rose , Bernie Coleman and Sam Hammam — were promptly voted onto MK City 's board " in an advisory capacity " . This was a separate personal investment by the four directors , Noades said at the time , and not relevant to a move , though he also spoke at length about the superior long @-@ term promise of the Milton Keynes location . 
 Despite his early optimism , Noades soon came to the conclusion that a League club in Milton Keynes would not draw crowds much higher than those Wimbledon already attracted in south London . " I couldn 't really see us getting any bigger gates than what Northampton Town were currently getting at that time , and , in fact , are still getting , " he recalled in 2001 . " I really couldn 't see any future in it . I can 't actually see that there is a means of drawing large attendances to Milton Keynes . " Abandoning his interest in MK City , Noades sold Wimbledon to Hammam in 1981 for £ 40 @,@ 000 . Later that year Noades bought nearby Crystal Palace and briefly explored merging that club with Wimbledon . 
 = = = Luton Town — " MK Hatters " ( 1980s ) = = = 
 Luton Town , based 20 miles ( 32 km ) from Milton Keynes in Luton and nicknamed " the Hatters " , were also seeking a new site at this time . As early as 1960 , then @-@ First Division Luton 's attendances had been deemed far too low for the top flight by Charles Buchan 's Football Monthly , which also considered their ground at Kenilworth Road , in the middle of town , to be hard to get to . At this time the club was already planning a 50 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity ground near Dunstable , to the north @-@ west of Luton , but no new ground materialised . Luton were relegated in 1960 and , apart from the 1974 – 75 season , remained outside of the top division until 1982 – 83 . 
 With the team still based at the " cramped and inadequate " Kenilworth Road in 1983 , the construction of a new road next to the ground escalated the need for a replacement . The Milton Keynes Development Corporation approached Luton proposing a new all @-@ seater stadium in central Milton Keynes , housing either 18 @,@ 000 or 20 @,@ 000 spectators , as part of a leisure and retail development . Luton 's owners were receptive to the idea ; according to The Luton News , the relocated " MK Hatters " would play home matches in a " super @-@ stadium " . This ground would reportedly have an artificial pitch and a roof ; Milton Keynes Council would invest heavily in its construction . The Luton chairman Denis Mortimer surmised if the team moved it would not only garner new fans from the Milton Keynes area but also retain the existing Luton fanbase . He said that the club was financially unsustainable at Kenilworth Road and would go bankrupt if it did not move . 
 The Milton Keynes idea was very poorly received by Luton fans and viewed , in Bale 's words , as " tearing the club from its most loyal supporters " . Luton fans held protest marches and rallies throughout the 1983 – 84 season , and chartered a plane to fly over Kenilworth Road during one match pulling a banner reading " Keep Luton Town F.C. in Luton " . Some 18 @,@ 000 Luton residents signed a petition against the club leaving . A consortium of local businessmen attempted to persuade Vauxhall Motors , General Motors ' Luton @-@ based British marque , to invest in the club and help with a new stadium in Luton . In Milton Keynes , some residents expressed fears that Luton 's arrival in central Milton Keynes might bring with it football hooliganism and threaten local amenities . Some Luton supporters boycotted the club 's first home match of the 1984 – 85 season in protest against the Milton Keynes plans . The wide unpopularity of the proposed move and the consistently vehement opposition from Luton 's local support combined to prevent it from occurring . " The directors want our support and our money , " said Tom Hunt , a member of a Luton fans ' action group against the move , " but they ignore the views of a community that wants to keep its football club . Why should fans pay at the turnstiles to help the club in business so that it can be taken away from us ? " 
 = = Wimbledon leave Plough Lane = = 
 = = = Taylor Report = = = 
 Wimbledon 's success as a club in the top flight of English football was founded on unorthodox financial management and judicious dealings in the transfer market . Rumours of a move or a merger with another London side persisted , leading the club 's chief executive Colin Hutchinson to resign in 1987 amid talk of an amalgamation with Ron Noades 's new club Crystal Palace or a groundshare at Queens Park Rangers ' Loftus Road ground in Shepherd 's Bush . Wimbledon were granted planning permission to build a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ seater ground in their home borough of Merton in 1988 , soon after they won the FA Cup , but the site was instead made into a car park by a newly elected Labour council in 1990 . Wimbledon 's desire to move was made a necessity a year later , when the Taylor Report , which ordered the extensive redevelopment of football grounds , was released . 
 When Hammam purchased the club from Noades in 1981 , Wimbledon also owned the ground at Plough Lane ; a pre @-@ emption clause existed , however , which reserved the site for " sports , leisure or recreational purposes " only . If Wimbledon Football Club were ever wound up , Plough Lane 's owners were legally bound to sell the stadium to Merton Council for £ 8 @,@ 000 , irrespective of inflation . This clause reduced the possibility of the club losing its home stadium , but it was unpopular with a succession of Wimbledon owners as it made the site practically worthless as real estate . Hammam complained that this limited his ability to borrow money needed to redevelop the ground . Seeking to increase Plough Lane 's commercial value , Hammam entered into negotiations with the council to remove the clause in 1990 ; the eventual agreed price for the revoking of the clause was a sum between £ 300 @,@ 000 and £ 800 @,@ 000 . At least one Wimbledon club director resigned his position in protest . 
 Even with this clause removed , the team could not afford to redevelop Plough Lane when required to do so the following year . Wimbledon moved about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) across south London before the start of the 1991 – 92 season to share Crystal Palace 's Selhurst Park ground . This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement while Wimbledon arranged the construction of their own new ground in a more local area , but the move was still unpopular among fans . Critics alleged that it was at least partly motivated by financial considerations , particularly the profit that might be gained from selling the old ground . The respective Wimbledon and Crystal Palace reserve teams <unk> at Plough Lane after the Wimbledon first team left . 
 = = = Wimbledon at Selhurst Park ; Dublin proposal = = = 
 Merton Council had been recommending that Wimbledon move to a site in nearby Beddington , but this proposal fell through soon after the move to Selhurst Park . With the inflation in costs brought on by the foundation of the FA Premier League in 1992 , the club soon began to lose money heavily . Rumours that the groundshare would eventually result in the Dons and the Eagles merging led Hammam to say " I ’ d rather die and have vultures eat my insides than merge with Crystal Palace " . In 1992 the Greyhound Racing Association offered to redevelop Wimbledon Stadium ( less than a mile from Plough Lane ) into a 15 @,@ 000 @-@ seater dog racing and football ground . Hammam was outraged two years later when the council , attempting to retain the Plough Lane site for public use , refused to sanction its sale for a supermarket redevelopment that Hammam said would finance a new ground at the dog racing site . Hammam angrily declared he would look elsewhere , and threatened to change the club 's name and remove the double @-@ headed eagle device , a symbol of Wimbledon Borough , from the team 's badge . " We have been betrayed , " he told the press . " The council say they want us back , but when it comes to taking action they don 't want to know . " 
 Hammam later claimed to have looked at every possible stadium site in Merton . He initially sought to relocate within south London , examining " seven boroughs " including <unk> and Brixton . He also began to consider selling the club . In 1994 , Wimbledon 's Irish manager Joe Kinnear contacted the football pundit and former player Eamon Dunphy to inform him of this and to put to him the idea of moving the club to Dublin . Dunphy was enthusiastic about the idea and became its main proponent in Ireland over the next three years . It was suggested that Wimbledon fans from London could be given free flights to Dublin for home matches , and that British Sky Broadcasting might pay to fly the opposing teams there during the first season . 
 Opinion polls in the Republic showed consistently high support for the idea of Wimbledon hosting Premier League matches in Dublin , but the League of Ireland argued that this would endanger its existence , and in September 1996 about 300 fans rallied in Dublin under the slogan " Resist the Dublin Dons " . Twenty Irish clubs " reaffirmed their opposition " to Wimbledon playing in Dublin the following month ; a week later Reuters called the proposal " dead and buried " . When Hammam requested talks with the Football Association of Ireland ( FAI ) top brass in April 1997 , they refused to even meet him . Vocal opposition from Wimbledon fans emerged — after a friendly match in August 1997 fans holding " Dublin = Death " and " Dons Belong In Merton " placards refused to leave the stadium for two hours . Soon afterwards , Hammam met six leading protesters , who told him that in the event of a move they would start a new non @-@ League club locally . 
 Playing away from Merton at a supposedly temporary home , Wimbledon set a record for the lowest @-@ ever English top @-@ flight attendance on 26 January 1993 , drawing only 3 @,@ 039 fans to a Tuesday @-@ night match against Everton . However the general trend was one of a sharp rise — the club 's average home attendance more than doubled at Selhurst Park from around 8 @,@ 000 during the last years at Plough Lane to a peak of over 18 @,@ 000 during the 1998 – 99 Premier League season . Wimbledon 's fans were a blend between locals who had supported the club since its non @-@ League days and supporters who had defected from other London teams . According to statistics compiled in 2000 , 56 % of Wimbledon season @-@ ticket holders were locally born ( the second lowest in the Premier League ) , and only 12 % had fathers who were Wimbledon fans . Many attended Wimbledon matches as it was cheaper and safer than other clubs in the capital — Wimbledon had more women and children at their games than any other top @-@ flight club . In 2000 , 23 % of Wimbledon season @-@ ticket holders earned over £ 50 @,@ 000 a year , the second @-@ highest in the division after Chelsea ( 33 % ) . 
 Hammam sold Wimbledon to two Norwegian businessmen , Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten , for a reported £ 26 million in June 1997 , while remaining at the club in an advisory role . In December that year , Wimbledon were reported to be considering the football and greyhounds option again . Ownership of Plough Lane was transferred from the club to <unk> Limited — a company founded in 1993 with Hammam serving as director . With political control of Merton Council having changed , Hammam secured the £ 8 million sale of Plough Lane to Safeway supermarkets in 1998 . He unsuccessfully attempted to gain permission to redevelop a former gas works in Merton during the same year , and soon after entered abortive negotiations over a site in Beddington . 
 Frustrated by the lack of progress , Hammam shifted his focus to Dublin and other locations outside London — Basingstoke , " Gatwick " , Belfast , Cardiff , Manchester , Wigan , Bristol , and Scotland . He later claimed that during this time seven clubs from outside London approached Wimbledon with groundshare offers . Similar opposition to that emanating from the Irish football hierarchy followed after Kinnear spoke of the Cardiff proposal : the Football Association of Wales stated they " will oppose the plan even if it means Premiership football coming to Cardiff " . By February 1998 , Clydebank of the Scottish third tier were also pursuing a move to the Irish capital . Swayed by Hammam 's offer of £ 500 @,@ 000 to each League of Ireland club , the same amount to the FAI and " schools of excellence all over the country " in return for support , five Irish teams now backed Wimbledon 's Dublin proposal . Later that year , after the Premier League had approved the idea , the lengthy , heated debate in Ireland ended with an FAI veto . With Dublin now not an option , Hammam attempted to buy Selhurst Park from Noades , who had sold Crystal Palace in 1998 , but still owned the ground . This led nowhere . Hammam finally sold his shares in Wimbledon in February 2000 , and seven months later became the owner of Cardiff City . Wimbledon were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 1999 – 2000 season . The average attendance at Wimbledon home matches dropped by more than half over the next year , from 17 @,@ 157 during the 1999 – 2000 season to 7 @,@ 897 during 2000 – 01 . 
 = = Milton Keynes Stadium Consortium = = 
 = = = Background and motivations = = = 
 The Milton Keynes Stadium Consortium or " Stadium MK " , led by Pete Winkelman and his company Inter MK Group , was formed in 2000 . It proposed a large development in the southern Milton Keynes district of Denbigh North , including a 30 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity football stadium , a 150 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 13 @,@ 935 m2 ) Asda hypermarket , an IKEA store , a hotel , a conference centre , and a retail park . The plan to build a ground of this size was complicated by the fact that there was no professional football club in Milton Keynes and that the highest @-@ ranked team in the town , ( another ) Milton Keynes City — based in Wolverton in northern Milton Keynes , and formerly known as Mercedes @-@ Benz F.C. — played in the then eighth @-@ tier Spartan South Midlands League , four divisions below the Football League . The developers could not justify building such a stadium for a club of this small stature . Rather than wait for MK City or another local team to progress through the pyramid , Winkelman resolved to " import " an established League club to use the ground . 
 Winkelman , an ex @-@ CBS Records executive and music promoter , had moved to the Milton Keynes area from London in 1993 . He attested to a vast untapped fanbase for football in Milton Keynes — a " football frenzy waiting to happen " , he said . Critics of this claim pointed to the apparent lack of public interest in Milton Keynes City and the other local non @-@ League clubs , and argued that Milton Keynes residents interested specifically in League football already had ample access with Luton , Northampton and Rushden & Diamonds all within 25 miles ( 40 km ) . In Winkelman 's own words , in a 2013 interview , he " didn 't have a clue about football " when he was proposing to move a League club from another town — indeed looking back he said " it was that naivety that enabled me to go and do it . " He was the only person in Milton Keynes publicly associated with the project ; his financial supporters , later revealed to be Asda ( a subsidiary of Walmart ) and IKEA , were kept strictly anonymous . According to an investigative report by Ian Pollock , published in When Saturday Comes in July 2002 , neither the Milton Keynes Council press office , the editor of the Milton Keynes Citizen newspaper nor the head of Invest in MK , the council agency encouraging businesses to move to the area , could tell him who was backing the plans . Winkelman told Pollock his supporters were " major business people in MK and some developers . A number of major international partners who 've done this sort of thing before . " 
 Opponents of such a move surmised that the stadium was a " Trojan Horse " included in the blueprint to bypass planning rules , and that although the consortium described the larger development as enabling the construction of the stadium , the reverse was the case — Winkelman 's consortium , they claimed , had to have a professional team in place right away to justify the ground so the development could get planning permission . David Conn of The Guardian corroborated this assessment . " The whole project was indeed dependent on Asda and IKEA , " Conn summarised in a 2012 article , after interviewing Winkelman . " Having seen the opportunity to build a stadium Milton Keynes lacked , and realised Asda did not have a store in the town , Winkelman acquired options to buy the land from its three owners , including the council . Asda would not have been granted planning permission for a huge out @-@ of @-@ town superstore unless it gave the council the benefit of building the stadium . [ A League club ] would move up , permission would be granted , then [ Winkelman ] would exercise the option to buy all the land , sell it to Asda and IKEA for very much more , and the difference would be used to build the stadium . " Conn retrospectively described this as a " deal of a lifetime " . 
 = = = Talks with Luton , Wimbledon , Barnet , Crystal Palace and QPR = = = 
 The first club approached was Luton Town , still based at Kenilworth Road , in 2000 . As in the 1980s , Luton 's owners liked the Milton Keynes idea but the fans strongly opposed it . The Football League stated that no member club could leave its own area and blocked the move . Nevertheless , Winkelman attempted to negotiate a move with two League clubs from London over the following months ; he approached Crystal Palace and Barnet , but neither was interested . Winkelman then offered the ground to Wimbledon . He registered several internet domain names with variants of " Milton Keynes Dons " and " MK Dons " in June 2000 . Wimbledon initially rejected the Milton Keynes idea . 
 Røkke and Gjelsten appointed a new club chairman , Charles Koppel , in January 2001 . According to Stephen Morrow in The People 's Game ? : Football , Finance and Society ( 2003 ) , Koppel had never been to a football match before becoming involved with Wimbledon and " gave the impression of being completely unaware of the relationship that exists between a football club and its supporters . " He was interested in an " enabling development " whereby a stadium could be created and funded as part of a business or leisure opportunity — exactly the kind of proposition put forward by Winkelman . 
 Towards the end of the 2000 – 01 season Wimbledon and Queens Park Rangers , who were in financial administration , entered discussions over a merger ; the new team would play at Loftus Road . The Football League announced on 2 May 2001 that it would give " favourable consideration " to a takeover of QPR by Wimbledon , but that the process would have to be very quick for the merged team to take part in the 2001 – 02 season . Noades – by now the owner of Brentford , who were themselves interested in a groundshare at Loftus Road – said that Wimbledon would have to give him 12 months ' notice to leave Selhurst Park . The majority of Wimbledon and QPR fans quickly made their opposition to a merger known . Following Wimbledon 's draw with Norwich City at Selhurst Park on 6 May , Koppel came onto the pitch and told the mostly jeering home fans that " there never was a merger proposal with QPR " ; the Loftus Road club had instigated the talks , he said . QPR abandoned the amalgamation plan two days later , citing potential fan alienation , while also announcing that there would be no further talks with Brentford . 
 A month later , Winkelman offered his Milton Keynes stadium site to QPR , promising that the club 's name and blue @-@ and @-@ white hooped strip would be kept in Buckinghamshire and that the fans would be represented on the board of directors . " We have real resources to put behind the club , " said Winkelman . " They are fast running out of solutions and we are the answer to their problems . " QPR dismissed the offer , leading the developers to once again contact Wimbledon later that month . With Koppel in charge , Wimbledon were more receptive this time around — Koppel said that Wimbledon 's owners were subsidising the club to the tune of £ 6 million per year and that such action was necessary to prevent its liquidation . As talks progressed , Winkelman approached the owner of Milton Keynes City , attempting to buy the club name . It soon became clear that the bulk of Wimbledon 's support strongly opposed a move of this kind . 
 = = Authorisation process = = 
 = = = Announcement and rejection ; appeal = = = 
 Koppel announced Wimbledon Football Club 's intent to move to Milton Keynes on 2 August 2001 with a letter to the Football League chief executive David Burns requesting approval . The letter stated that Wimbledon had already signed an agreement to relocate and " subject to the necessary planning and regulatory consents being obtained " intended to be playing home games at a newly built stadium in Milton Keynes by the start of the 2003 – 04 season . The proposed move was opposed in most quarters : along with most of Wimbledon 's fans and many football supporters generally , the League , the Football Association ( the FA ) , Merton Council , most football writers in the national press and a 150 @-@ man Parliamentary All @-@ Party Committee voiced disapproval . Two similar club relocations had occurred in the Scottish professional ranks during the 1990s , but the permanent relocation of an English League club to another conurbation was unprecedented . A group of Wimbledon fans decided to boycott club merchandise in protest against the plans , and launched an " alternative matchday programme for both home and away fans " , Yellow and Blue , to compete against the official publication . The League board unanimously rejected Wimbledon 's proposed move on 16 August 2001 , stating that any Milton Keynes club would have to earn membership by progressing through the pyramid and that " franchised football " would be " disastrous " . 
 Koppel appealed against this decision , calling it and the process by which it was reached " deficient and unlawful " ; he insisted that re @-@ basing in Milton Keynes was the only way Wimbledon could survive . Burns expressed strong personal opposition in response , declaring that allowing such a move would " destroy what football is about " . To consider whether Wimbledon had the right to contest the League 's decision , the Football Association formed an ad hoc arbitration panel made up of FA vice @-@ chairman and Arsenal vice @-@ chairman David Dein , York City chairman Douglas Craig , and Charles Hollander QC . Craig was a controversial choice for some because of his actions as York chief ; he had sold his club 's stadium Bootham Crescent to a holding company he also owned for £ 165 @,@ 000 in July 1999 , then in December 2001 announced his intention to evict the team and sell the ground for £ 4 @.@ 5 million . Winkelman told reporters that even if the appeal were unsuccessful " our door will be open to any club in trouble " . 
 After considering extensive written evidence from Wimbledon F.C. , the Football League , the FA , the Premier League , the Football Conference , the Scottish Football League , Milton Keynes City F.C. , Merton Council , the Football Supporters ' Association and the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association ( WISA ) , and oral submissions from Koppel , Burns and Andrew Judge of Merton Council , the arbitration panel unanimously ruled on 29 January 2002 that the League 's decision had " not been properly taken in the legal sense , and that the procedures had not been fair " — the League , the panel reported , had rejected Wimbledon 's application " not on its merits , but on the basis of an inflexible view or policy " . The question of Wimbledon 's proposed move was remitted to the Football League board , which reconvened on 17 April 2002 and concluded that the matter should be considered by an independent commission appointed by the Football Association . The FA agreed and in the first week of May appointed Raj Parker of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm to chair the commission , with Aston Villa 's operations director Steve Stride and Alan Turvey , a member of the FA Council and chairman of the Isthmian League , as commissioners . Under FA Rule F the Football League and Wimbledon were informed of these appointments ; neither objected . Acknowledging Koppel 's request that the matter be resolved by the end of the month because of Wimbledon 's financial problems , the FA set a deadline of 31 May 2002 for the commission 's " final and binding " verdict , and released a press statement on 10 May inviting anyone interested to send written submissions care of the FA . By this time the fans ' matchday publication Yellow and Blue was outselling the official Wimbledon F.C. programme by three to one . 
 = = = Independent commission ; approval = = = 
 Parker , Stride and Turvey sat at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer 's Fleet Street offices on 14 , 15 , 16 and 22 May 2002 . Legal counsel instructed by <unk> appeared for Wimbledon ; the League , which had engaged external lawyers for the arbitration hearing , this time did not , deciding that its objections were adequately set out in the written material . The League and FA contributions were summarised in the commission report as concerns that a relocated club would , in effect , " drive a coach and horses through the pyramid structure " , " herald , or risk heralding , a franchise system for football whereby the investors in football could relocate clubs at will " and " dramatically change the defining characteristics of the English domestic game where clubs are identified with the locality or community built up over time " . " English football is not organised on the basis of a franchise system in which different communities may bid for clubs competing in competitions , " the FA statement concluded . " If a move effectively involved a break of the links with the community with which the club is traditionally associated , and a move to an entirely new community , with an intent to put down new roots and reinvent the club with a new identity and a new set of allegiances , and yet the club did not want to relinquish its place in the pyramid , go down to a lower level and work its way back up , the FA believes that allowing such a move would have a fundamental impact on the organisational framework of the game . " 
 Wimbledon 's statement centred on the club 's precarious financial situation and a claim that its case was unique . It stressed that Wimbledon ( referred to in the statement as " WFC " ) had lacked its own home stadium for 11 years and asserted that the club did not have " firm and extensive roots within the conurbation from which it takes its name " . According to the club statement , " the vast majority " of Wimbledon fans were not from Merton and " less than 20 % of the 3 @,@ 400 season ticket holders " lived there . Milton Keynes was , the statement said , Wimbledon 's " last chance of financial survival " ; the move 's opponents did not properly appreciate the club 's fiscal troubles and " wrongly assume [ d ] that there is a viable alternative in south London . " The new ground in Milton Keynes was feasible despite the club 's financial problems as it would be almost entirely funded by the consortium 's enabling development . Wimbledon 's identity — " traditions , history , colours , name , strip , stadium design and the like " — would be preserved in Milton Keynes and supporters from London would be offered subsidised travel and tickets . The statement concluded that " infinitely more harm would be caused to football if WFC went out of business " and that a " proportionate exercise of discretion ... would allow the relocation in WFC 's exceptional circumstances . " 
 The commissioners heard oral statements from Winkelman , Koppel , Louise Carton @-@ Kelly of the Dons Trust fundraising group , Kris Stewart of the WISA , Nicholas Coward of the FA and Steve Clark , Merton Council 's head of planning . Winkelman was described in the report as " a passionate and frank witness , who is genuinely concerned to promote the interests of Milton Keynes and WFC . " He expressed a wish to retain Wimbledon 's " name , strip , branding and the like " , and spoke of renaming local roads and calling the stadium site " Wimbledon Park " . Winkelman predicted that an overwhelming majority of Wimbledon fans would continue to follow the club in Milton Keynes . The commission summarised the fans ' submitted views as almost universally negative and reported that most perceived a continuation of the club in Milton Keynes as no better than liquidation . Stewart , when asked if he would prefer life for the club in Milton Keynes or death in Merton , said he regarded both as death and that in either case he would attempt to " resurrect the club and start at the bottom of the pyramid " . 
 The commission report described redeveloping Plough Lane , which Merton Council insisted remained viable " if there is a will for the club to pursue this option " , as the only recourse for Wimbledon other than Milton Keynes . A feasibility study carried out by Drivers Jonas , commissioned and funded jointly by Wimbledon F.C. and Merton Council , described a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity stadium at Plough Lane as physically possible but " extremely ambitious " , risky and financially unsustainable given the club 's money problems . The commission ruled that it was unreasonable to expect Wimbledon 's owners to pursue a move back to Plough Lane under these circumstances . Parker and Stride concluded that on the evidence presented Milton Keynes was the only option that would give the club a chance of financial survival , and therefore ruled in favour of the move , two to one — Turvey dissented — on 28 May 2002 .

 The FA stated that although the decision was final and binding , it still strongly opposed the relocation . It emphasised that its recommendation to the commissioners had been against the move . " The Football Association sees it as vital for the game to stop these circumstances ever happening again , " the statement concluded . The chief executive of the FA , Adam Crozier , said that he believed the commission to have made an " appalling decision " . Koppel said the decision had saved Wimbledon Football Club . A spokesman for Milton Keynes Council said the people of Milton Keynes were looking forward to the team 's arrival . " It will be of great benefit to the city , " he said ; " Milton Keynes is becoming a city of sport . " In the eyes of the WISA , the Dons Trust and most of the Wimbledon F.C. fanbase , the move 's sanctioning marked the " death of their club " . " If it moves it will mean nothing to us , " said Marc Jones , a WISA spokesman . Wimbledon F.C. became widely reviled by football supporters across the country and pejoratively nicknamed by some as " Franchise F.C. " . 
 A group of disaffected Wimbledon F.C. fans led by Stewart , Jones , Ivor Heller and Trevor Williams resolved to found their own team , in their view a spiritual continuation or " phoenix " version of the original . Within weeks , they had done so ; the new side , AFC Wimbledon , entered a groundshare arrangement with Kingstonian at the latter club 's home ground at Kingsmeadow , in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames , adjacent to Merton and about 5 miles ( 8 km ) from Plough Lane . The fans ' club was accepted into the Combined Counties League , seven levels below Wimbledon F.C. ' s place in the second tier , and began play at the start of the 2002 – 03 season . The WISA , the Dons Trust and the vast majority of Wimbledon F.C. ' s fanbase switched allegiance to the new club . The assertion in the commission report that " resurrecting the club from its ashes as , say , ' Wimbledon Town ' " would be " not in the wider interests of football " particularly infuriated AFC Wimbledon 's founders and became an integral part of club lore . 
 Wimbledon F.C. hoped to move to Milton Keynes immediately , but as the new ground was yet to be built an interim home in the town would have to be found first . The first proposal , to start the 2002 – 03 season at the National Hockey Stadium in central Milton Keynes , was abandoned because it did not meet Football League stadium criteria . While alternative temporary options were examined — Winkelman suggested converting the National Bowl music venue — Wimbledon F.C. started the season at Selhurst Park and set a target of playing in MK by Christmas . Central Milton Keynes Shopping Centre became the team 's new sponsor ; " GO – MK " was emblazoned across the players ' shirts . Before Wimbledon F.C. ' s first game of the season , against Gillingham on 10 August 2002 , AFC Wimbledon supporters picketed outside Selhurst Park , tried to dissuade home fans from entering and shouted " scab " and " scum " at those who did . The attendance was officially announced as 2 @,@ 476 , including 1 @,@ 808 from Gillingham . The breakaway club claimed an average crowd of over 3 @,@ 700 during its first months , while Wimbledon F.C. attracted less than 3 @,@ 000 , most of whom were followers of visiting teams . The loss of income from gate receipts would contribute to Wimbledon F.C. subsequently entering administration . 
 Safeway demolished Plough Lane and sold the site to a property developer in November 2002 . Milton Keynes Council meanwhile granted planning permission to convert the National Bowl into a temporary football stadium , but the Football League delayed a decision on these plans in October 2002 . At Selhurst Park , Wimbledon F.C. reported a divisional record low attendance of only 849 — including over 200 away fans , around the same number of complimentary tickets , and Wimbledon F.C. youth players and members of the press — for the Tuesday @-@ night game against Rotherham United on 29 October 2002 . A temporary stadium in Milton Keynes proved difficult to arrange and Wimbledon F.C. remained in south London at the end of the season . On the field , the side finished the second @-@ tier campaign in 10th place . Koppel re @-@ adopted the National Hockey Stadium as his preferred interim destination , announcing a plan to convert the stadium for football and play there from the start of the 2003 – 04 season .

 The College of Arms had informed Wimbledon F.C. in August 2002 that its continued use of the Wimbledon double @-@ headed eagle device for its logo was illegal , so the club adopted a new badge before the 2003 – 04 season . It featured a stylised eagle 's head drawn in navy blue and yellow outline , the yellow forming the letters " MK " . The club was concurrently compelled to stop using a <unk> for its mascot after the owners of the Wombles brand refused to renew the relevant licence agreement in protest against the move to Milton Keynes . Tottenham Hotspur , Charlton Athletic and Luton Town scheduled pre @-@ season friendly matches against Wimbledon F.C. , but then cancelled them in quick succession after each set of supporters protested . Koppel accused the WISA of orchestrating a campaign against the club , and said the Tottenham and Charlton friendlies had been cancelled in part because of concerns that the National Hockey Stadium might not be ready on time ( Luton would have been an away match ) . It was widely speculated that Wimbledon F.C. would be " renamed , ' rebranded ' even " after moving , with " MK Dons " reported in the press as a possible new name , but Koppel denied this . " It remains Wimbledon Football Club . That is our history and the tradition of the club , " he said . 
 On 5 June 2003 Gjelsten told Koppel he could not go on subsidising Wimbledon F.C. , and withheld the scheduled monthly injection of £ 800 @,@ 000 . Koppel declared Wimbledon F.C. insolvent the next day and put it into administration with reported debts of £ 3 @.@ 5 million . John Gurney , who had just become the chairman of Luton Town following a takeover by a consortium from Hong Kong and the United States , briefly floated the idea of buying Wimbledon F.C. and merging it with Luton , in his words " effectively buying a back door to Division One " ( Luton were in the division below ) , but was soon after ousted by Luton supporters . In late June , after Wimbledon F.C. missed a deadline to invest in renovations to the Hockey Stadium , the National Hockey Foundation pulled out of discussions over the ground 's use , creating confusion as to where the club would now be located . The administrators stated on 27 June that as things stood the move to Milton Keynes was off . A week later , after Watford had refused to let Wimbledon F.C. share their ground at Vicarage Road , the administrators announced a return to Selhurst Park . 
 Winkelman had not intended to own Wimbledon F.C. himself ; his plan had been to work alongside it while the stadium was built in Denbigh and then give the ground to the club in exchange for shares and a place on the board . He had not expected it to go into administration . With the move threatened and the club facing liquidation , he made " the life @-@ defining decision " , to quote Conn , " of taking it on himself " . He secured funds from his consortium for the administrators to pay the players ' wages , keep the club operating , and pay for the necessary renovations for the National Hockey Stadium to host League football . He made clear that his group 's interest was conditional on the club moving to Milton Keynes . In late July Winkelman and the club 's administrators concluded a deal with the Hockey Stadium 's owners to carry out conversion work and play there from October — Wimbledon F.C. would return to Selhurst Park in the meantime . Meanwhile , Milton Keynes City F.C. went out of business before the start of the season following an unsuccessful drive for new directors and investors . 
 After hosting the first few home matches of the campaign at Selhurst Park — 1 @,@ 054 saw them lose 4 – 2 to Wigan Athletic in their last home game in London — Wimbledon F.C. received Football League clearance to host matches at the National Hockey Stadium on 19 September 2003 , and eight days later played their first match in Milton Keynes , against Burnley . The game drew a crowd of 5 @,@ 639 , including 893 away fans . Wimbledon F.C. went two goals down before coming back to draw 2 – 2 ; Dean Holdsworth scored the club 's first goal in Milton Keynes . The team struggled on and off the pitch for the rest of the season , losing important players regularly as the administrators sold them to keep the club afloat , and eventually finished bottom of the second @-@ tier First Division . Attendances at the National Hockey Stadium were higher than those at Selhurst Park during the 2002 – 03 season , but lower than those of the 2001 – 02 season . The 2 – 1 defeat to Sunderland on 7 April 2004 that confirmed Wimbledon F.C. ' s relegation was attended by 4 @,@ 800 , of whom 2 @,@ 380 were away fans . 
 After Gjelsten agreed to write off the £ 24 million he and Røkke had lent to the club since 1997 , a company voluntary arrangement ( CVA ) was put together on 18 March 2004 under which Winkelman 's consortium would take Wimbledon F.C. out of administration , reportedly using a holding company called MK Dons . This was accepted by most of Wimbledon F.C. ' s creditors , but delayed while the Inland Revenue decided whether or not to pursue the club 's £ 525 @,@ 000 debt to the UK taxpayer before the Law Lords . The Football League threatened to expel the club if the takeover were not completed by 31 July . In May Property Week reported that the new stadium in Denbigh would be cancelled if Wimbledon F.C. were wound up . Richard Foreman , a director of the consortium 's development consultant , denied this , saying that the project would continue with " the total support of the council " ; the consortium would invite another League team to move , he said , and would have 18 months to do so . This did not prove necessary . After the Inland Revenue announced on 27 May that it would not pursue the club 's debt , Winkelman 's Inter MK Group brought Wimbledon F.C. out of administration in late June 2004 , paying £ 850 @,@ 000 for the club , and concurrently announced changes to its name , badge and colours . 
 = = = MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon = = = 
 The new name of the relocated club was Milton Keynes Dons F.C. ( commonly shortened to MK Dons ) . Inter MK explained that this name was intended to " represent the past , present and future and place the club at the heart of its new community " as well as to retain a connection with the club 's former identity . The Football League gave final approval to the CVA on 1 July 2004 , and the same day confirmed the transfer of the Wimbledon F.C. League share to Milton Keynes Dons Ltd . 
 The blue and yellow home colours that Wimbledon F.C. players had worn were replaced by white shirts , shorts and socks , with black , red and gold as accent colours . The first MK Dons away outfit comprised red shirts , shorts and socks . Both white and red had been used by Wimbledon F.C. as away colours over the previous two decades . The club badge became a rendering of the letters " MK " , with the " K " positioned below the " M " , rotated 90 ° anti @-@ clockwise and defaced with the year " <unk> " ( 2004 ) . 
 In line with its self @-@ perception as the spiritual continuation of Wimbledon F.C. , AFC Wimbledon attempts to emulate the original team 's appearance in almost every way . The fans ' club plays in the same blue and yellow home colours and uses the Wimbledon double @-@ headed eagle for its badge . AFC Wimbledon continue to use the " Dons " nickname , despite its synchronous use in Milton Keynes . They also retain the " Wombles " label formerly applied to Wimbledon Football Club .

 Milton Keynes Dons continued to play at the National Hockey Stadium while the development including the new ground was constructed in Denbigh . Asda paid Inter MK £ 35 million for its section of the site , Ikea £ 24 million . Ground was broken on the stadium in February 2005 . In December 2005 MK Dons set a target of playing at the new ground by January 2007 ; in February 2007 they revised their proposal to a 22 @,@ 000 @-@ seater stadium ready in July of that year , with provision for expansion to 32 @,@ 000 ( it had originally been intended to seat 30 @,@ 000 ) . The new ground , named Stadium mk , hosted its first match in July 2007 . 
 In late 2014 , it was reported that Tottenham Hotspur were in negotiations with MK Dons over a temporary groundshare at Stadium mk for a season , during renovations at Spurs ' White Hart Lane ground . According to press reports , Tottenham proposed to play most home matches in MK and a small number at Wembley Stadium . The idea of playing home matches in Milton Keynes , even temporarily , is largely unpopular with Spurs fans . The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters Trust stated in September 2014 that it would have " serious issues " with such an arrangement . In a London Evening Standard poll of 206 Tottenham fans two months later , 71 ( 34 % ) said they would attend home matches at Stadium mk if the club played there temporarily , while 135 ( 66 % ) said they would not . The Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore stated in July 2015 that the Premier League would have no objection to Tottenham groundsharing temporarily — either with MK Dons or with Chelsea at Wembley — but to defend " the integrity of the competition " would not allow Tottenham to play home matches at more than one location in the same season . Two months later , the FA chief executive Martin Glenn indicated that he supported the idea of clubs playing temporarily at Wembley while their grounds were redeveloped . 
 AFC Wimbledon remain at Kingsmeadow as of the 2015 – 16 season . In December 2015 Merton Borough Council granted the club planning permission to build a new 11 @,@ 000 @-@ seater stadium on Plough Lane , with provision for expansion to 20 @,@ 000 , on the site of the greyhounds stadium less than a mile from where the former Wimbledon F.C. ground stood . 
 = = Legacy of Wimbledon F.C. = = 
 The location of the history and legacy of Wimbledon F.C. , as well as the honours won by the club , was disputed for five years after the independent commission 's approval of the move on 28 May 2002 . In the view of AFC Wimbledon and that club 's supporters , the " identity of a football club is implicitly bound up in its community " . The club regards itself as Wimbledon F.C. ' s spiritual continuation to this day , holding that the community maintaining and backing AFC Wimbledon is the same one which originally formed Wimbledon Old Centrals ( later Wimbledon F.C. ) in 1889 , " and kept Wimbledon Football Club alive until May 2002 " . 
 MK Dons initially maintained that any debate was pointless as their club was simply a renamed Wimbledon F.C .. Winkelman was unequivocal when answering readers ' questions in FourFourTwo magazine in November 2004 : " MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage , but we 're the real child of Wimbledon " , he wrote . One reader asked : " Now that you have renamed the team , and changed the badge and colours , do you agree that AFC Wimbledon now carry the true spirit of Wimbledon ? " ; Winkelman replied that AFC Wimbledon 's founders had betrayed their club and " left their team before their team left them " . In another answer , he poured scorn on suggestions that he might give Wimbledon F.C. ' s trophy replicas to AFC Wimbledon , writing that the fans had " abdicated their right to it when they all walked away . " " The fans who have continued to support us from London — they 're the ones who 've had to put up with this shit for so long , " he concluded . 
 The Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association founded the Wimbledon Old Players Association ( <unk> ) in September 2005 as part of its drive to " reclaim the history of Wimbledon Football Club for AFC Wimbledon and / or the community of Wimbledon " . Membership was opened to any former Wimbledon F.C. or AFC Wimbledon player or manager . There were 60 founder members . A " Wimbledon " team , organised by <unk> and backed by AFC Wimbledon , played in the London Masters indoor football tournament in July 2006 . Plough Lane was replaced by a residential development comprising six blocks of flats . Representatives of AFC Wimbledon , the WISA , Merton Council , Barratt Homes and the Dons Trust attended a ceremony in November 2008 at which the development 's gate and each of the buildings was named after a figure from Wimbledon F.C. ' s past . 
 Despite Winkelman 's strong words in 2004 , his club later agreed to hold talks with the Football Supporters ' Federation ( FSF ) , the MK Dons Supporters Association and the WISA . The FSF was refusing to admit MK Dons supporters , discouraging friendly matches against MK Dons , and urging football fans generally to boycott MK Dons home games . The parties reached an agreement in October 2006 . The FSF would end its calls for a boycott and admit MK supporters as members , and in return MK Dons would " recognise and genuinely regret the hurt which was caused to supporters of the former Wimbledon F.C. by the move to Milton Keynes " , renounce any claim to Wimbledon F.C. ' s history up to 2004 and transfer the Wimbledon F.C. trophy replicas , copyrights , web domain names and other patrimony to Merton Borough . All of this was done in August 2007 . The Wimbledon F.C. trophies were put on display at Morden Library in Merton in April 2008 . 
 Sections of MK Dons ' fans continue to relate to their club 's former identity as Wimbledon . When AFC Wimbledon and MK Dons met on the playing field for the first time in 2012 , some MK supporters wore scarves bearing the Wimbledon name , and Wimbledon F.C. shirts . Others have attempted to reclaim the " Franchise F.C. " label for their own use , chanting " you 're getting beat by a franchise " during matches . 
 In January 2012 the Wimbledon Guardian newspaper launched a campaign called " Drop the Dons " , with the aim of persuading MK Dons ' owners to remove " Dons " from their club 's name . The WISA joined the campaign almost immediately , saying that it believed the use of " Dons " by MK Dons was counter @-@ productive for all parties . The campaign was publicly backed by several former Wimbledon F.C. and AFC Wimbledon figures , both Merton Members of Parliament and all 60 of the borough 's councillors . Most MK Dons supporters reacted to the campaign with anger . One MK season @-@ ticket holder interviewed by the Milton Keynes Citizen , a former Wimbledon F.C. fan based in London , suggested that " AFC Wimbledon should drop Wimbledon from their name as they don 't play in Wimbledon . " The leaders of Merton and Milton Keynes Councils met in Milton Keynes in April 2012 to discuss the campaign , and agreed to differ on the matter of a name change . Later that year , shortly before the first AFC Wimbledon – MK Dons match , Winkelman told reporters that " Dons " would not be dropped from his club 's name unless it was the will of MK supporters . " I have learned to do what the supporters want , " he said . 
 In a December 2012 interview , Winkelman expressed some regret about what had happened . " I 'm not proud of the way this club came to exist , and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece , but I can 't put the genie back in the bottle , " he said . " Do I think it was right ? No . Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon ? No ... I don ’ t feel in the right over the way this club was born . But I don ’ t think I could live with myself if I hadn 't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation . It was about to be completely <unk> ... What happened was my fault , and I have to take responsibility for it . But I don ’ t see why my players , staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness , it 's nothing to do with them . " 
 = = Fixtures between AFC Wimbledon and MK Dons = = 
 As of the 2016 close season , AFC Wimbledon and MK Dons have played competitive fixtures against each other three times , in cup competitions on each occasion . All three matches have been at Stadium mk ; there have been two MK wins and one for AFC . The two sides met for the first time on 2 December 2012 , in the second round of the 2012 – 13 FA Cup . MK Dons won 2 – 1 with an injury time winner scored by Jon <unk> with his heel ; MK fans dubbed the goal the " Heel of God " ( a spoof on the 1986 Argentina – England " Hand of God " ) . Kyle <unk> 's opening goal for MK Dons in the second match between the two clubs , a 3 – 1 MK win in the first round of the League Cup in August 2014 , was also scored with his heel , and was consequently labelled " Heel of God II " . Two months later , in the Football League Trophy Southern section second round , AFC Wimbledon defeated MK Dons 3 – 2 with a winning goal by Adebayo Akinfenwa . 
 The two clubs are set to play each other in the league for the first time during the 2016 – 17 season , after the 2015 – 16 campaign ended with MK Dons ' relegation to League One and AFC Wimbledon 's promotion via the play @-@ offs to the same division .

 " You 're Getting Old " is the seventh episode and the mid @-@ season finale of the fifteenth season of the American animated television series South Park , and the 216th episode of the series overall . It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 8 , 2011 . In the episode , Stan begins to develop a profound sense of cynicism after celebrating his tenth birthday . Meanwhile , Randy latches onto a new music genre , " tween wave , " in an attempt to fit in , which causes problems in his marriage with Sharon . 
 The episode was written by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker and was produced at the end of the show 's " spring " run . He and co @-@ creator Matt Stone had created the idea of Stan 's existential crisis as a parallel with their own real @-@ life aging . " You 're Getting Old " ends abruptly ; Stan 's parents separate and his problem remains unresolved . The conclusion was inspired by modern television dramas , which are often serialized and are less likely to have the standard " happy ending . " The episode created significant media attention , and was interpreted by some critics as a metaphor for the frustration experienced by creators Parker and Stone stemming from the show 's continued production . 
 The episode received very positive reviews from contemporary television critics , who praised the episode 's ending and overarching theme on growing older . According to Nielsen Media Research , the episode was seen by 2 @.@ 29 million viewers the week it was broadcast . The episode 's ending is continued in the mid @-@ season premiere , " Ass Burgers " , which aired in October 2011 . " You 're Getting Old " was released on DVD and Blu @-@ ray along with the rest of the fifteenth season on March 27 , 2012 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At Stan 's tenth birthday party , his present from Kyle is the latest CD from a " tween wave " band , but Sharon forbids Stan to listen to the CD and promptly takes it away . After Randy argues with Sharon over the matter , he decides to sit down and listen to the CD ( which , to the viewer and the adults , is the sound of drum beats and defecation ) . Randy claims to enjoy the CD , but Sharon does not believe him . As tween wave music becomes popular , Sharon and the other boys ' parents forbid them from listening to any of it , and try to play for them The Police 's song " Every Breath You Take " as an example of what they consider to be good music . To the boys and the viewer , however , it literally sounds like people defecating on the soundtrack , just as the " tween wave " music is presented as sounding to the adults . That night , Stan secretly listens to the confiscated music but discovers , to his confusion , that it now " sounds like shit " . 
 Stan goes to the doctor , who , after examining him , diagnoses him as a " cynical asshole " . From ice cream to movie trailers , Stan can now only see the bad in things , and this negative outlook alienates him from Kyle , Kenny , and Cartman , who begin avoiding him . When Stan catches them secretly going to the movies without him after lying about having the flu , he comes along , only for his attitude to ruin the trailers and Kyle , Kenny , and Cartman leave the theater . Cartman then coldly informs Stan that they do not want to hang out with him anymore and leaves with Kenny . As Stan and Kyle argue over this , Stan literally sees Kyle as a large piece of feces that defecates instead of talking , indicating that he sees them as " shit " . 
 Sharon accuses Randy of merely feigning interest in modern music in order to hold onto his childhood dreams of being a musician , and deny that he is getting older . Randy , however , ignores her , and starts performing tween wave music at the local bowling alley under the name " Steamy Ray Vaughn " , with defecation as part of the act . During a duet with a woman billing herself as " Steamy Nicks " , Sharon catches Randy at the bowling alley , resulting in an argument . She excoriates him for the various schemes and fads that he has often briefly taken with over the years , such as getting into fights at baseball games , playing World of Warcraft , and becoming a celebrity chef , but Randy reveals that he is unhappy , and has been for a long time . The two agree that while they are both unhappy , they do not feel the same about each other any more . Two old farmers , who previously watched Randy perform , overhear the argument and break into the Marshes ' home to steal Randy 's underwear , believing that they are acting humanely on its behalf . 
 As Fleetwood Mac 's song " Landslide " plays , Sharon and Randy separate and sell their house , with Stan , Sharon and older sibling Shelly moving into a new home . The police arrest the farmers and recover Randy 's underwear . A new friendship appears to develop between Kyle and Cartman , who share a smile while playing video games together . Stan , now completely alienated from his friends , shows no signs of his cynicism ending .

 " You 're Getting Old " was the final episode of the spring run , which contained the first seven episodes of South Park 's fifteenth season . The first element of the episode 's plot line to be crafted was Stan 's tenth birthday and his feeling of getting old , as a reference to Parker and Stone 's own aging ( at the time of the episode 's broadcast , Stone had just turned 40 and Parker was 41 ) . They decided to make a two @-@ part episode , with the second half airing at the beginning of the fall run , set to begin in October 2011 . Parker and Stone did not write the second part until they reconvened in the fall . 
 Another idea from which the episode was crafted was the fictional " tween wave " genre : initially , the episode would have found the genre enjoyed by all citizens of the town of South Park , not just a younger audience . By Sunday , completed animated shots were being edited together and set to the song " Landslide " by Fleetwood Mac . The song 's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night , when they eventually received clearance to use it . Parker noted later that they had backup songs to use if necessary , but none fit as well as " Landslide " . They were very satisfied with the ending , feeling it provided a very emotional conclusion to the show . In addition , the episodes contains what Parker describes in the commentary as " our favorite thing of any South Park ever " : the Duck President , who communicates by spraying feces from his mouth . " Every time in the retake room when Duck President was on , shitting , quacking and shitting , we just thought it was the greatest thing ever , " he remarked . 
 The dialogue between Sharon and Randy that would provoke significant attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning , less than 48 hours prior to broadcast , and was one of the last completed parts of the show . Parker likened the scene to an afterthought , as he felt it was not necessarily central to the episode 's story . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The episode 's top theme has been described as " universal and timeless , but also specific and personal : growing up and dealing with change . " The episode makes it clear that Stan 's pre @-@ adolescent battle with cynicism is not necessarily representative of all " tweens " ; one reviewer described the character 's problem as more common to depression . The episode also mocks how " cynical culture breeds cynical audiences , " typified in the " contemptuous trailers " for predictable films during the scene set at the cinema , which often end with the insult " Fuck you ! " Sean O 'Neal , in the episode 's review at The A.V. Club , linked the episode 's theme to modern culture : " The Internet has turned nearly everyone into a cynic . " Time reviewer James Poniewozik disagreed with his assessment , but did note that " there 's definitely an argument that the instant dissection of all experience online encourages a kind of protective dismissiveness . " The episode was also interpreted as a satire of immediate online responses from fans , who criticize South Park as stale but continue to watch regardless . 
 South Park generally ends on a positive note and " resets " upon the next episode , in which way it is connected to traditional television sitcoms , as it does not serialize or employ story arcs with frequency . An example of this format is best characteristic of the show 's early years , in which the character of Kenny was killed in each episode . In contrast , the stark , abrupt ending of " You 're Getting Old " was inspired by modern television dramas , in which events can go poorly , and the episode ends regardless . The character of Sharon references this in one of the episode 's final moments , criticizing , on a meta level , the show 's form and reliance on " happy endings . " Stone likened this structure to an " immature view of the world " : he remarks in the episode 's DVD commentary that things do not often end on a " happy " note in real @-@ life . Likewise , the dialogue between Sharon and Randy near the end of the episode functions as a meta @-@ comment on the show 's general form , which is consequently broken . 
 A central element of the episode ’ s plot line concerns the fictional " tween wave " genre of music , which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense . In the episode , children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it ; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps . In this sense , Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story " The Emperor 's New Clothes " . Reviewers interpreted the episode 's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show 's use of scatological humor , but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as " crap " or " shit . " Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion , and also an observation on the show 's recurring philosophy , which he described as the exact opposite : " how other people care too much about things , and that many of our big problems and scandals would go away if everyone could just relax and feel less passionate . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode makes a reference to the 2011 films Mr. Popper 's Penguins and Jack and Jill , the latter an Adam Sandler comedy notable for its extremely poor reception . Its inclusion in the episode was actually based off the film 's trailer . Reviewers suggested various different musical genres as the " tween wave " genre parodied in the episode , including dubstep , <unk> , and chillwave . In addition , prior to the episode 's broadcast , Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times predicted " tween wave " would be a spoof of the hip hop group Odd Future , who were also receiving heavy media attention at that time . In his desperate attempt to fit in with popular music , Stan 's father , Randy , forms his own tween wave act : " Steamy Ray Vaughan , " a pun on the blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan , who collaborates with singer " Steamy Nicks , " a pun on Stevie Nicks , vocalist from Fleetwood Mac . The episode also makes reference to the 2011 video game L.A. Noire .

 Comedy Central 's press release prior to the airing of the episode alluded to its significance , stating : " After Stan celebrates his 10th birthday , he begins to see everything differently ... The very fabric of South Park begins to unravel . " Coinciding with production and performance of the Broadway musical The Book of Mormon produced by the South Park creators , there had been speculation over doubt within the writing team on the future of South Park . Following the episode 's broadcast , it received significant media attention due to its ending and themes . Much of the conversation centered on the final scene of dialogue between the Marshes , with Entertainment Weekly noting it could be " a not @-@ so @-@ thinly @-@ veiled way of Stone and Parker telling us they had a similar discussion about their very show . " Critics pointed to a March 2011 profile in The Hollywood Reporter , in which they spoke at how they dreaded to return to producing South Park : " I don 't know how we 're going to do it . It 's a nightmare . " " Knowing that Parker and Stone have been experiencing a bit of an existential crisis or even just restlessness definitely made tonight seem unusually thematically heavy , " remarked Sean O 'Neal of The A.V. Club . 
 Parker and Stone were in New York to attend the 65th Tony Awards , when they were requested for interviews and had to answer questions at press junkets regarding the episode . On June 15 , 2011 , Parker and Stone appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , where they denied being unhappy with the show and stated that they still enjoy producing episodes . Parker commented that , while the episode did deal with some issues they had with the show , they particularly enjoyed creating " You 're Getting Old " , and that despite not knowing what upcoming episodes would be about , they would figure it out upon resuming production in August 2011 . " Looking back at it , it kinda does look like we ’ re kinda saying we don 't want to do this anymore , but it 's not really what we were saying , " said Parker in the episode 's DVD commentary .

 In its original American broadcast on June 8 , 2011 , " You 're Getting Old " was watched by 2 @.@ 295 million viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research . 
 Reaction to " You 're Getting Old " was positive . Critics pointed to the self @-@ referencing aim of the episode in growing older and redefining senses of humor as well as cynicism . While Ramsey Isler of IGN found the episode to be largely humorless and monotonous , he interpreted this as intentional on the part of the show 's creators , who he believed had grown weary of creating the series . Isler called the final moments of the episode " the most somber material the series has ever produced ... providing the emotional soundtrack for a montage of images that just rip the heart out of any South Park fan " , giving the episode an 8 @.@ 5 / 10 . HitFix 's review on the episode focused on its personal philosophic themes , with reviewer Alan Sepinwall stating " But what was interesting about Stan 's existential crisis , and how he struggled to like anything , is that the show 's philosophy has often largely been about how other people care too much about things ... Yet here , Stan 's lack of passion – and the Marsh parents ' – was clearly shown to be a bad thing for them . " 
 Sean O 'Neal of The A.V. Club commented on the " finality " of the episode , noting that although the creators were still under contract until 2013 , " there are already scores of people questioning on IMDB boards and Twitter whether it was , in fact , a surprise series finale . " O 'Neal saw the use of the Fleetwood Mac song " Landslide " ( the only song in the episode that does not feature the sounds of defecation ) in the episode 's closing moments to have served as " both a parody of a self @-@ serious drama 's season finale and an actual , self @-@ serious , dramatic season finale . " James Poniewozik of Time remarked that the episode moved him to tears , commenting that it is " one of those episodes that managed to combine the many different things lesser South Park episodes do individually : pop @-@ culture parody , scatological hilarity and stories about childhood . " He described the dialogue between the Marshes as “ stunningly genuine , ” summarizing the episode as " simultaneously one of the most juvenile episodes South Park has ever done , and possibly its most mature . " 
 In December 2011 Time magazine ranked the episode at # 7 in its list of Top 10 TV Episodes of 2011 , with James Poniewozik commenting , " With no easy wrap @-@ up to Stan 's depression and ending with an entirely unironic montage set to ' Landslide ' , South Park showed that it too can grow up — if , thankfully , not by much .

 = Captain Future ( magazine ) = 
 Captain Future was a science fiction pulp magazine launched in 1940 by Better Publications , and edited initially by Mort Weisinger . It featured the adventures of Captain Future , a super @-@ scientist whose real name was Curt Newton , in every issue . All but two of the novels in the magazine were written by Edmond Hamilton ; the other two were by Joseph Samachson . The magazine also published other stories that had nothing to do with the title character , including Fredric Brown 's first science fiction sale , " Not Yet the End " . Captain Future published unabashed space opera , and was , in the words of science fiction historian Mike Ashley , " perhaps the most juvenile " of the science fiction pulps to appear in the early years of World War II . Wartime paper shortages eventually led to the magazine 's cancellation : the last issue was dated Spring 1944 . 
 = = Publication history and contents = = 
 Although science fiction ( sf ) had been published before the 1920s , it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories , a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback . By the end of the 1930s , the field was booming . Better Publications , a pulp magazine publisher which had acquired Thrilling Wonder Stories in 1936 , launched three new magazines as part of this boom . The first two were Startling Stories , which appeared in January 1939 , and Strange Stories , which began the following month ; both were edited by Mort Weisinger , who was also the editor of Thrilling Wonder Stories . Edmond Hamilton , an established science fiction writer , met with Leo Margulies , Better Publication 's editorial director , in early 1939 , and they subsequently planned the launch of a new magazine with the lead character of Curt Newton , a super @-@ scientist who lived on the moon and went by the name " Captain Future " . Margulies announced the new magazine at the first World Science Fiction Convention , held in New York in July 1939 , and the first issue , edited by Weisinger , appeared in January of the following year . Captain Future 's companions in the series included an enormously strong robot named <unk> , an android named Otho , and the brain of Simon Wright , Newton 's mentor . Joan Randall , Newton 's girlfriend , was also a regular character . Better Publications followed up the magazine launch with a companion comic , Startling Comics , which appeared in May 1940 ; Captain Future was the protagonist of the lead story . Weisinger left in 1941 to edit comics following the adventures of Superman , and was replaced by Oscar J. Friend . 
 Captain Future was a hero pulp : these were pulps which were built around a central character , with every issue containing a lead story featuring that character . Every issue of Captain Future contained a novel about Curt Newton . Hamilton was willing to write the lead novel for every issue , but was concerned that he might be drafted , so Margulies made arrangements for other writers to contribute the lead stories . Hamilton escaped the draft , but Margulies had already made arrangements for other writers to work on the series , and so two of the seventeen lead novels in the magazine were written by Joseph Samachson , instead of by Hamilton . The house name " Brett Sterling " was invented to conceal the identity of the new writer ; it was used for both of Samachson 's contributions , as well as some of Hamilton 's . Hamilton also wrote regular features that provided background material on the stories : " Worlds of Tomorrow " provided information about the planets featured in the stories , and " The <unk> " covered Newton 's companions . In addition to the novels about Curt Newton , Captain Future published both new and reprinted science fiction stories that were unconnected with the lead character . Fredric Brown 's first sf sale , " Not Yet the End " , appeared in the Winter 1941 issue ; and Weisinger reprinted David H. Keller 's The Human Termites and Laurence Manning 's The Man Who <unk> , both abridged , in the first few issues of the magazine ; these had originally appeared in 1929 and 1933 , respectively , and were from back issues of Wonder Stories , which Better Publications had acquired the rights to in 1936 . The magazine was unashamedly focused on straightforward space opera : a typical plot saw Captain Future and his friends save the solar system , or perhaps the entire universe , from a villain . Sf historian Mike Ashley describes the magazine as " perhaps the most juvenile " of the World War II crop of science fiction pulps . Wartime paper shortages killed the magazine in mid @-@ 1944 , but more Captain Future novels saw print in Startling Stories , some over the next two years , with more following in 1950 and 1951 .

 Captain Future was pulp format , 128 pages , and was priced at 15 cents ; the first seven issues were edited by Mort Weisinger , and the remaining ten by Oscar J. Friend . There were three issues to a volume . The schedule was quarterly , with one omission : there was no Fall 1943 issue . The publisher was Better Publications , with offices in Chicago and New York , for all issues . The magazine was subtitled " Wizard of Science " for the first four issues ; after that the subtitle was " Man of Tomorrow " , a name that had already been used by the Superman franchise for their hero . 
 Thirteen Captain Future novels were reprinted as paperbacks at the end of the 1960s , all by Popular Library . Ten of these , all printed in 1969 , were originally printed in Captain Future as follows : 
 = Široka Kula massacre = 
 The Široka Kula massacre was the killing of 41 civilians in the village of Široka Kula near Gospić , Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence . The killings began on 13 October 1991 and continued until late October . They were perpetrated by the Croatian Serb SAO Krajina police and generally targeted ethnic Croat civilians in Široka Kula . Several victims were ethnic Serbs suspected by the police of collaboration with Croatian authorities . Most of the victims ' bodies were thrown into the Golubnjača Pit , a nearby karst cave . 
 Thirteen individuals were charged and tried in connection with the killings , four were convicted in absentia in Belgrade . The other eleven were tried and convicted in absentia in Gospić . One of the those convicted by Gospić County Court subsequently returned to Croatia , where he was granted a retrial and acquitted . A monument dedicated to the victims of the massacre was built in the village in 2003 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In August 1990 , an insurrection took place in Croatia centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas , including parts of Lika , around the city of Gospić , with significant Serb populations . The areas were subsequently named SAO Krajina and , after declaring its intention to integrate with Serbia , the Government of Croatia declared it to be a rebellion . By March 1991 , the conflict escalated into the Croatian War of Independence . In June 1991 , Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated . A three @-@ month moratorium followed , after which the decision came into effect on 8 October . 
 As the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) increasingly supported the SAO Krajina , the Croatian Police were unable to cope . Thus , the Croatian National Guard ( ZNG ) was formed in May 1991 . The development of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September , while the military conflict in Croatia continued to escalate — the Battle of Vukovar started on 26 August . By the end of August the fighting intensified in Lika as well , specifically as the Battle of Gospić continued through much of September . 
 = = Killings = = 
 SAO Krajina forces occupied the village of Široka Kula in September 1991 . The village was located 11 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 miles ) northeast of Gospić in Lika . It had an ethnically mixed prewar population of 536 consisting of Croats and Serbs , but most of the Croat population fled by the end of the month . 
 On 13 October , the chief of the SAO Krajina police in Široka Kula instructed the remaining Croats in the village to move to two houses before they were evacuated . After the civilians complied with the request , SAO Krajina forces shot at the assembled villagers , while houses owned by Croats were looted and torched by a mob . The attack resulted in thirteen civilian deaths . The victims were killed using shotguns and their bodies thrown into burning houses . Some of the victims were burned to death . Most of those killed were elderly , and at least one of the victims was a child . In the following days , the killings continued . According to a 2013 news report , a total of 41 civilians were killed in the village that month , and most of the corpses thrown into the Golubnjača Pit , 22 of which were retrieved from the karst cave as of 2011 . In November 1992 , Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) police estimated that the bodies of approximately forty Croat civilians were thrown into the pit . 
 In mid @-@ October , SAO Krajina police arrested four Serbian civilians in Široka Kula , Mane Rakić and his three children for allegedly collaborating with Croatian authorities . During the night of 20 / 21 October , the police searched Rakić 's home , and then killed his wife in another house in Široka Kula . Her body was doused with kerosene and torched . By the end of the month , Rakić and his children were also murdered and their remains thrown into the Golubnjača Pit . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Five SAO Krajina police officers were prosecuted by Knin District Court in 1992 for the murder of the Rakić family . The investigation was spurred on by requests from relatives of the victims , who threatened the RSK authorities that they would notify the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) unless the RSK authorities continued searching , which led Đuro <unk> , president of Knin District Court to write to the Minister of the Interior of the RSK asking for instructions on how to proceed , stating that any attempt to retrieve the bodies of the Rakić family would uncover numerous other bodies in the Golubnjača Pit . He requested instructions on how to proceed with the investigation and what to do if the UNPROFOR found out about the bodies in the pit . Even though the RSK investigation was completed , trial of those suspected of involvement in the murders did not begin before 2010 in Belgrade . The trial and the appeals process were concluded in 2013 , resulting in four convictions : Čedo <unk> was sentenced to thirteen years in prison , while Mirko <unk> , Milan <unk> and Bogdan <unk> were sentenced to twelve , ten , and eight years in prison respectively . 
 In 1994 , the County Court in Gospić tried and convicted in absentia a group of seven Croatian Serbs for their involvement in the killings of eight civilians ( members of the Nikšić and Orešković families , but not the Rakić family ) in Široka Kula , handing out prison sentences . Nikola <unk> , Miroslav Serdar and Dragan <unk> were sentenced to 20 years in prison each , while Dane Serdar , Dušan <unk> , Milorad <unk> and Dragan <unk> each received sentences of 15 years in prison . In 1997 , the County Court in Gospić also tried Vladimir <unk> and Branko <unk> in absentia for taking part in the massacre . Both of them were convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison . None of those convicted in absentia served any prison time . Dane Serdar voluntarily returned to Croatia in September 2003 and was granted a retrial as he had been convicted in absentia . Dane Serdar 's 1994 conviction was overturned and he was acquitted in September 2004 , after prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence against him . 
 A monument to the victims of the massacre , as well as 164 World War II victims from the area of Široka Kula , was built in 2003 . The monument , designed by Petar <unk> and named the Croatian History Portal ( Portal <unk> <unk> ) , was unveiled by the relatives of those killed in the 1991 massacre on 13 October , marking the 12th anniversary of the killings . 
 = Glad ( duke ) = 
 Glad ( Bulgarian : <unk> , Hungarian : <unk> , Romanian : Glad , Serbian : <unk> ) was the ruler of Banat ( in present @-@ day Romania and Serbia ) at the time of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 900 AD , according to the Gesta Hungarorum . The Gesta , which was written by an author known in modern scholarship as Anonymus in the second half of the 12th century or in the early 13th century , is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle . The Gesta did not refer to the enemies of the conquering Hungarians ( or Magyars ) , who had been mentioned in earlier annals and chronicles , but wrote of a dozen persons , including Glad , who are unknown from other primary sources of the Hungarian Conquest . Therefore , modern historians debate whether Glad was an actual enemy of the conquerors or only a " fictitious person " made up by Anonymus . In Romanian historiography , Glad is described as one of the three Romanian dukes who ruled a historical region of present @-@ day Romania in the early 10th century . 
 According to the Gesta , Glad came from Vidin in Bulgaria . He occupied Banat with the assistance of " Cumans " before the arrival of the Magyars . Anonymus wrote that Cumans , Bulgarians , and Vlachs ( or Romanians ) , supported Glad against the invading Magyars , but the latter annihilated their united army in a battle near the Timiș River . The Gesta presents Ahtum , who ruled Banat in the early 11th century , according to the longer version of the Life of St Gerard , as Glad 's descendant . 
 = = Background = = 
 The earliest record of the Magyars ( or Hungarians ) is connected to their alliance with the Bulgars against a group of Byzantine prisoners who were planning to cross the Lower Danube in an attempt to return to their homeland around 837 AD . They dwelled in the steppes north and northwest of the Black Sea . A group of rebellious subjects of the Khazar Khaganate , known as Kabars , joined them , according to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus . The Annals of St. Bertin states that the Magyars launched their first military expedition against the Carolingian Empire in 861 . 
 The Magyars invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantine Empire in 894 . In retaliation , the Bulgars entered into an alliance with the Pechenegs . They jointly invaded the Magyars ' lands , forcing them to leave the Pontic steppes and cross the Carpathian Mountains in search of a new homeland . In the Carpathian Basin , the Magyars " roamed in the wildernesses of the Pannonians and Avars " before attacking " the lands of the <unk> , Moravians and Bulgars " , according to the contemporaneous Regino of Prüm . 
 The Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin is the principal subject of the Gesta Hungarorum , which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle . Most scholars agree that a notary of Béla III of Hungary , who ruled between 1173 and 1196 , wrote the Gesta after the king 's death . According to an alternative theory , the author of the Gesta , who is now known as Anonymus , had served Béla II of Hungary before starting to complete his work around 1150 . Anonymus did not write of Svatopluk I of Moravia , Braslav , Duke of Lower Pannonia and the invading Magyars ' other opponents who had been mentioned in works written in earlier centuries . Neither did he refer to the Magyars ' fights with the Moravians , Franks and Bavarians which had been described in earlier annals and chronicles . On the other hand , Anonymus wrote of local polities and rulers — including Gelou , the Vlach duke of Transylvania , Menumorut , the lord of the regions between the rivers Mureș , Someș and Tisza , and <unk> , the Bulgar ruler of the lands between the Danube and the Tisza — unknown from other primary sources . 
 = = Banat on the eve of the Hungarian Conquest = = 
 Stirrups , horse bits and spear points from inhumation graves unearthed at <unk> German suggest that the Avars settled along the Mureș River in Banat soon after their conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the late 560s . However , most archaeological finds in the lands south of the Mureș that had been attributed to the Avars are dated to the " Late Avar " period . Written sources show the survival of Gepids under Avar rule in the wider region of the Timiș River . For instance , the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of " three Gepid settlements " which were destroyed by an invading Byzantine army in 599 or 600 . A rich burial yielding weapons unearthed at Pančevo and the Treasure of Sânnicolau Mare show that an important center of power existed in Banat in the " Late Avar " period , according to archaeologist Florin Curta . However , " Late Avar " cemeteries did not survive the 8th century . 
 The Franks launched a series of expeditions against the Avar Khaganate in 790s , causing its disintegration . Krum of Bulgaria , who reigned between around 802 and 814 , soon tried to take advantage of the fall of the Avars and invaded former Avar territories , but no contemporaneous report mentioned his conquest in the Carpathian Basin . The Abodrites who lived in " Dacia on the Danube as neighbors of the Bulgars " sent envoys to Emperor Louis the Pious in 824 , complaining " about vicious aggression by the Bulgars " and seeking the emperor 's assistance against them , according to the Royal Frankish Annals . The Abodrites inhabited the lands along either the Timiș or the Tisza . According to a memorial inscription from Provadia , a Bulgar military commander , <unk> , drowned in the Tisza , implying Omurtag of Bulgaria 's attempts to expand his rule in the region in the 820s . The Bulgars invaded Moravia in 863 and 883 , suggesting that they controlled at least the crossing @-@ points across the rivers Mureș and Tisza , according to the historian István Bóna . 
 Bóna writes that the Bavarian Geographer is the last source which contains contemporaneous information of the eastern regions of the Carpathian Basin in the 9th century . According to this source , which is actually a list of the tribes inhabiting the lands east of the Carolingian Empire around 840 , the <unk> , who had 30 civitates , or fortified centers , lived along the southernmost parts of the empire 's eastern frontiers . Their land also bordered on Bulgaria . According to an alternative theory of the location of Moravia , which is primarily based on the Bavarian Geographer and Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus 's report of " great Moravia , the unbaptized " , Banat was the center of this early medieval polity , which was annihilated by the conquering Magyars . Archaeologist Silviu <unk> identifies the <unk> with the Abodrites , adding that they were obviously a Slavic tribe . The name of the <unk> and other rivers implies that a population speaking a Turkic language — Avar , Bulgar , or Pecheneg — also inhabited the Banat in the Early Middle Ages , but those rivers may have received their names only in the 11th or 12th centuries . 
 Historian Vlad Georgescu writes that archaeological research has proven the existence of about 60 settlements in Glad 's duchy . Other historians , including Sălăgean and Pop , say that the earth @-@ and @-@ wooden or stone fortresses unearthed at <unk> , Cenad , <unk> , Orșova , <unk> , and Vladimirescu were Glad 's forts . Florin Curta says that the dating of these sites is uncertain .

 According to the Gesta Hungarorum , Rus ' princes gave a short description of the Carpathian Basin to the Magyar commanders before they decided to invade the territory . The princes told them that " Slavs , Bulgarians , Vlachs , and the shepherds of the Romans " inhabited the territory . In short , Anonymus continued , one of the princes , the Prince of Halych , also informed the Magyar leaders of the polities among which the territory was divided and their rulers . Among these local rulers , the Rus ' prince listed Glad who had " taken possession of the land from the river Mureș up to the castle " of <unk> ( <unk> or Vršac ) with the help of the Cumans . In another chapter of the Gesta , Anonymus wrote that Glad " held power from the Mureș River to the castle of Palanka " , showing that he identified Glad 's duchy with the territory that is now known as Banat . Anonymus explicitly referred to Glad as " the prince of that country " in the same chapter . 
 The Gesta did not write of the peoples inhabiting Glad 's duchy . On the other hand , it stated that Glad commanded " a great army of horsemen and foot soldiers " and his army was " supported by Cumans , Bulgarians and Vlachs " . According to Tudor Sălăgean and other Romanian historians , the list of the peoples reflects the one @-@ time ethnic composition of the Banat , showing that a Turkic people ( Pechenegs , Avars or Kabars ) , Bulgarians and Vlachs , or Romanians , inhabited the region in the late 9th century . Historian Victor Spinei writes that Anonymus 's reference to the " Cumans " supporting Glad 's army shows that Glad sought the Pechenegs ' assistance against the invading Magyars . 
 Anonymus wrote that Glad had come " from the castle of Vidin " and occupied his duchy " with the help of the Cumans " . This report , together with Anonymus 's reference to the Bulgarians ' assistance against the Magyars , suggests that Glad was subjected to Simeon I of Bulgaria , according to Sălăgean . This theory is not accepted by historian Ioan @-@ Aurel Pop , who writes that it is only an " attractive " scholarly hypothesis which has not been proven . Madgearu says that the Banat , which had been an integral part of Bulgaria since the late 820s , became an independent state under Glad 's rule after the death of Simeon I in 927 . Pop also says Anonymus 's reference to Glad 's arrival from Vidin suggest that Glad was either Bulgarian or Romanian , because the region of that town was densely populated by Romanians . The name of Glad is most probably of South Slavic origin , according to Pop and Neagu Djuvara . In connection with Glad , Anonymus also emphasized that " from his line was born " a chieftain , named Ahtum , whom Stephen I of Hungary defeated in the first half of the 11th century , according to the Long Life of Saint Gerard . 
 = = = The conquest of Banat = = = 
 According to the Gesta Hungarorum , the Magyars conquered the lands between the Danube and the Tisza , Transylvania , the western regions of present @-@ day Slovakia and Transdanubia before their supreme head , Árpád , and his chieftains decided to send an army to invade Glad 's duchy . They dispatched three commanders — named " Zovárd , Kadocsa , and Vajta " — with the task . The three commanders crossed the Tisza at <unk> and halted at the <unk> River before advancing as far as the Bega River . In the next two weeks , they forced the inhabitants of the region between the Mureș and Someș to yield and to give their sons as hostages . Thereafter , Anonymus continued , the Magyar army marched towards the Timiș and " encamped beside the ford of <unk> " where they wanted to cross the river . However , Glad and his large army awaited them on the other bank . A day later , Zovárd " enjoined his brother , Kadocsa , to go lower down with half his army and try to cross in any way in order to attack the enemy " , and Kadocsa obeyed this command . Both divisions crossed the river and stormed the enemy camp . In the battle , " two dukes of the Cumans and three <unk> of the Bulgarians were slain " before Glad decided to retreat , but his army was annihilated . 
 Anonymus writes that Glad took shelter in " the castle of Kovin " , while the Magyars marched to " the borders of the Bulgarians " and encamped at the <unk> River . Zovárd , Kadocsa and Vajta laid siege to Kovin , forcing Glad to surrender it three days later . In short , they also seized Orșova where they lived " for a whole month " , according to the Gesta . Vajta returned to Árpád , taking with him the hostages and the booty , while Zovárd and Kadocsa sent an envoy to Árpád to ask permission to invade the Byzantine Empire . Ioan @-@ Aurel Pop writes that Glad must have survived his defeat and recovered at least parts of his duchy in exchange for paying a tribute to the Magyars , because his descendant , Ahtum , ruled the territory some decades later , according to Anonymus . 
 = = Glad in modern historiography = = 
 Glad is one of the local rulers who are mentioned only in the Gesta Hungarorum . Historians have continuously debated the reliability of Anonymus 's work which was first published in 1746 . Anonymus 's reference to the Cumans , Bulgarians and Vlachs supporting Glad is one of the key points in the scholarly debate , because the Cumans did not arrive in Europe before the 1050s . Vlad Georgescu , Victor Spinei , Ioan @-@ Aurel Pop and many other Romanian historians identify the " Cumans " , or <unk> , as Pechenegs , Avars or Kabars , saying that the Hungarian word that Anonymus translated as " Cuman " ( kun ) originally dubbed any Turkic tribe . According to other historians , including Dennis Deletant , György Györffy and Carlile Aylmer Macartney , Anonymus 's reference to the three peoples is an anachronism , which reflects the ethnic composition of the late 13th @-@ century Bulgaria . 
 In Romanian historiography , Glad is presented as one of the three local " voivodes " who ruled territories inhabited by Romanians at the time of the Hungarian Conquest . Madgearu and Pop list almost a dozen place @-@ names from the Banat and its wider region which suggest that settlements were named after Glad . For instance , a village named <unk> ( formerly <unk> ) and a monastery named <unk> were first mentioned in 1308 and 1333 , respectively , and an Ottoman document from 1579 referred to two villages named <unk> and a settlement named <unk> . Silviu <unk> writes that the theory of a connection between Glad and the name of those settlements is " considerably weak " , because neither the origins nor the chronology of those place names have so far been thoroughly studied . <unk> also says , " the historical geography of the Banat is reflected quite accurately in the chronicle " , which suggests that Anonymus knew the geographical features of the region , but does not prove that Glad was a real person . According to Györffy and other historians , Anonymus who invented all local rulers in the Gesta named Glad after the village where the monastery was built . Deletant , Macartney and other scholars also say that Anonymus seems to have borrowed many episodes of his narrative of Glad ( including his connection with Vidin ) from the story of his alleged descendant , Ahtum , in the Long Life of Saint Gerard . 
 = RNA thermometer = 
 An RNA thermometer ( or RNA thermosensor ) is a temperature @-@ sensitive non @-@ coding RNA molecule which regulates gene expression . RNA thermometers often regulate genes required during either a heat shock or cold shock response , but have been implicated in other regulatory roles such as in pathogenicity and starvation . 
 In general , RNA thermometers operate by changing their secondary structure in response to temperature fluctuations . This structural transition can then expose or occlude important regions of RNA such as a ribosome binding site , which then affects the translation rate of a nearby protein @-@ coding gene . 
 RNA thermometers , along with riboswitches , are used as examples in support of the RNA world hypothesis . This theory proposes that RNA was once the sole nucleic acid present in cells , and was replaced by the current DNA → RNA → protein system . 
 Examples of RNA thermometers include FourU , the Hsp90 cis @-@ regulatory element , the ROSE element and the <unk> thermometer . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The first temperature @-@ sensitive RNA element was reported in 1989 . Prior to this research , mutations upstream from the transcription start site in a lambda ( λ ) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein . This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or <unk> life cycle in λ phage , with high concentrations of cIII promoting <unk> . Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures ; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable , and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature . This RNA thermometer is now thought to encourage entry to a lytic cycle under heat stress in order for the bacteriophage to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell . 
 The term " RNA thermometer " was not coined until 1999 , when it was applied to the <unk> RNA element identified in Escherichia coli . More recently , bioinformatics searches have been employed to uncover several novel candidate RNA thermometers . Traditional sequence @-@ based searches are inefficient , however , as the secondary structure of the element is much more conserved than the nucleic acid sequence . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Most known RNA thermometers are located in the 5 ' untranslated region ( UTR ) of messenger RNA encoding heat shock proteins — though it has been suggested this fact may be due , in part , to sampling bias and inherent difficulties of detecting short , <unk> RNA sequences in genomic data . 
 Though predominantly found in prokaryotes , a potential RNA thermometer has been found in mammals including humans . The candidate thermosensor heat shock RNA @-@ 1 ( <unk> ) activates heat @-@ shock transcription factor 1 ( <unk> ) and induces protective proteins when cell temperature exceeds 37 ° C ( body temperature ) , thus preventing the cells from overheating . 
 = = Structure = = 
 RNA thermometers are structurally simple and can be made from short RNA sequences ; the smallest is just 44 nucleotides and is found in the mRNA of a heat @-@ shock protein , <unk> , in <unk> species PCC <unk> . Generally these RNA elements range in length from 60 @-@ 110 nucleotides and they typically contain a hairpin with a small number of mismatched base pairs which reduce the stability of the structure , thereby allowing easier unfolding in response to a temperature increase . 
 Detailed structural analysis of the ROSE RNA thermometer revealed that the mismatched bases are actually engaged in nonstandard basepairing that preserves the helical structure of the RNA ( see figure ) . The unusual basepairs consist of G @-@ G , U @-@ U , and UC @-@ U pairs . Since these noncanonical base pairs are relatively unstable , increased temperature causes local melting of the RNA structure in this region , exposing the Shine @-@ Dalgarno sequence . 
 Some RNA thermometers are significantly more complex than a single hairpin , as in the case of a region found in <unk> mRNA which is thought to contain a <unk> , as well as multiple hairpins . 
 Synthetic RNA thermometers have been designed with just a simple single @-@ hairpin structure . However , the primary sequence of such short RNA thermometers can be sensitive to mutation , as a single base change can render the hairpin inactive in vivo . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 RNA thermometers are found in the 5 ' UTR of messenger RNA , upstream of a protein @-@ coding gene . Here they are able to occlude the ribosome binding site ( RBS ) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein . As temperature increases , the hairpin structure can ' melt ' and expose the RBS or Shine @-@ Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit ( 30S ) , which then assembles other translation machinery . The start codon , typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine @-@ Dalgarno sequence , signals the beginning of a protein @-@ coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome . In addition to this cis @-@ acting mechanism , a lone example of a trans @-@ acting RNA thermometer has been found in <unk> mRNA where it is thought to be involved in the starvation response . 
 A specific example of an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica . When exposed to temperatures above 45 ° C , the stem @-@ loop that base @-@ pairs opposite the Shine @-@ Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur . Mg2 + ion concentration has also been shown to affect the stability of FourU . The most well @-@ studied RNA thermometer is found in the <unk> gene in Escherichia coli . This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through <unk> , a specialised heat @-@ shock sigma factor . 
 Though typically associated with heat @-@ induced protein expression , RNA thermometers can also regulate cold @-@ shock proteins . For example , the expression of two <unk> proteins are regulated by an RNA thermometer in the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus and a similar mechanism has been identified in <unk> . 
 RNA thermometers sensitive to temperatures of 37 ° C can be used by pathogens to activate infection @-@ specific genes . For example , the upregulation of <unk> , encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes , was demonstrated by fusing the 5 ' DNA of <unk> to the green fluorescent protein gene ; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli , and fluorescence was observed at 37 ° C but not at 30 ° C. 
 = = Implications for the RNA world hypothesis = = 
 The RNA world hypothesis states that RNA was once both the carrier of hereditary information and enzymatically active , with different sequences acting as biocatalysts , regulators and sensors . The hypothesis then proposes that modern DNA , RNA and protein @-@ based life evolved and selection replaced the majority of RNA 's roles with other biomolecules . 
 RNA thermometers and riboswitches are thought to be evolutionarily ancient due to their wide @-@ scale distribution in distantly @-@ related organisms . It has been proposed that , in the RNA world , RNA <unk> would have been responsible for temperature @-@ dependent regulation of other RNA molecules . RNA thermometers in modern organisms may be molecular fossils which could hint at a previously more widespread importance in an RNA world . 
 = = Other examples = = 
 Hsp90 cis @-@ regulatory element regulates <unk> in Drosophila , increasing the translation rate of the heat shock protein at high temperatures . 
 The <unk> operon of E. coli is predicted to contain two co @-@ operative RNA thermometers : a ROSE element and the <unk> thermometer . 
 <unk> and <unk> are found in <unk> <unk> japonicum and Agrobacterium <unk> respectively . They exist in the 5 ' UTR of <unk> mRNA , and repress heat shock protein translation at physiological temperatures .

In the final episode of the series , Ross and Rachel finally confess their love for each other , and Rachel gives up a job in Paris to be with him . 
 Courteney Cox portrays Monica Geller , the mother hen of the group and a chef , known for her perfectionist , bossy , competitive , and obsessive @-@ compulsive nature . Monica is often jokingly teased by the others for having been extremely overweight as a child , especially by her brother Ross . Monica works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show . Monica ’ s first serious relationship is with long @-@ time family friend Richard Burke , who is twenty @-@ one years her senior . The couple maintains a strong relationship for some time , until Richard expresses that he does not want to have children , much to Monica ’ s dismay . Monica and Chandler Bing later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale , leading to their marriage in season seven and adoption of twins at the end of the series . 
 Lisa Kudrow portrays Phoebe Buffay , an eccentric masseuse and self @-@ taught musician . As a child , Phoebe lived in uptown New York with her mother , until she committed suicide and Phoebe took to the streets . Phoebe is ditsy but street smart . She writes and sings her own quirky songs , accompanying herself on the guitar . She has an " evil " identical twin named Ursula , who shares Phoebe ’ s quirkiness , but , unlike Phoebe , seems to be selfish and uncaring . Phoebe is childlike and innocent in disposition . She tends to use her past misfortunes such as her mother ’ s suicide as sympathy ploys – or rather , to mock others ' self @-@ indulgent self @-@ pity . Phoebe has three serious relationships over the show 's run : David , a scientist , in season one , whom she breaks up with when he moves to Minsk on a research grant ; Gary , a police officer whose badge she finds , in season five ; and an on @-@ and @-@ off relationship with Mike Hannigan in seasons nine and ten . In season nine , Phoebe and Mike break up due to his desire not to marry . David returns from Minsk , leading to the two getting back together , but she eventually rejects him for Mike when both of them propose to her . Phoebe and Mike marry in season ten . 
 Matt LeBlanc portrays Joey Tribbiani , a struggling actor and food lover who becomes famous for his role on soap opera Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray . Joey is a simple @-@ minded womanizer with many short @-@ term girlfriends . Despite his womanizing , Joey is innocent , caring , and well @-@ intentioned . Joey often uses the catchphrase pick @-@ up line " How you doin ' ? " in his attempts to win over most of the women he meets . Joey rooms with his best friend Chandler for years , and later with Rachel . He falls in love with Rachel in season eight , but Rachel politely tells Joey that she does not share his feelings .
