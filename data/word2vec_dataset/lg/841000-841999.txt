 = 1887 Halloween tropical storm = 
 The 1887 Halloween tropical storm was a late @-@ season tropical cyclone that caused significant damage along the East Coast of the United States during Halloween of 1887 . The sixteenth tropical storm of the annual hurricane season , it formed from an area of disturbed weather over the Gulf of Mexico on October 29 . The storm later came ashore along the west coast of Florida . After crossing the state , it produced severe thunderstorms along the North Carolina – Virginia coastline before becoming extratropical on November 1 . The extratropical system intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . It eventually dissipated on November 6 , shortly after hitting northwest France . 
 The storm affected the town of Norfolk , where it became the most damaging storm since 1879 . Despite the damage inland , the storm is best known for the unusually high amount of shipwrecks and maritime incidents it caused . One ship , a schooner called the Manantico , capsized , killing the captain and one of its crew members . Three other ships were driven ashore on Virginia beaches from Dam Rock to Cape Henry , and numerous others were put in danger . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The storm originated from an area of disturbed weather that had persisted in the Gulf of Mexico during late October 1887 , outside the area of coastal stations . On October 29 , the disturbance completed tropical cyclogenesis and became the sixteenth tropical storm of the season . After forming , the storm was located 200 miles ( 320 km ) northwest of Key West and began moving east @-@ northeastward , making landfall on the Florida Peninsula . It crossed land and emerged over water within the next eight hours while weakening . During its passage near Fort Meade , the storm had an estimated barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 007 millibars ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) , supporting minimal tropical storm strength . Upon crossing the state , it paralleled the East Coast for two days while restrengthening . It passed closest to land near the North Carolina coastline on October 31 at its peak intensity , with sustained winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and a pressure of 993 millibars ( 29 @.@ 3 inHg ) . Shortly after moving away from land , it became extratropical . 
 The extratropical cyclone moved away from the coast and strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale on November 1 . It began a weakening trend on November 2 while taking a wavering path across the north Atlantic Ocean . On November 4 , the cyclone started a general east @-@ southeast motion , passing near the southwest coasts of Ireland and Great Britain . It made landfall on the Cotentin Peninsula of France on November 6 and dissipated , although one proposed track , which is a modified track that differs from the official record due to new evidence or theory , was given by Charles Mitchell that showed the cyclone executing a counter @-@ clockwise loop over northwest France until dissipating the storm on November 8 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 In its formative stages , the storm was responsible for causing rain from the Rio Grande Valley along the Gulf Coast to Florida . As the storm crossed Florida , Fort Meade recorded less than 1 in ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) of rainfall . As it strengthened off the East Coast , the storm caused damage in various towns . A maximum wind speed of 54 mph ( 87 km / h ) was measured at Hatteras , North Carolina . In Kitty Hawk , impact from the storm was more intense , generating maximum winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) to as high as 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) from late on October 30 to the following afternoon ; despite the intensity , only minor damage was reported . In Lenoir and Raleigh , heavy rain totals up to 4 @.@ 18 in ( 10 @.@ 6 cm ) were reported . Unusually , reports of hail and snow were also received from these locations . Telegraph poles were snapped on Bodie Island and south of Little <unk> , affecting communication . The worst land @-@ based impact from the storm was in Virginia . Cape Henry was hit with a combination of wind , rain , and blown sand on October 31 and communications between Cape Henry and Norfolk were lost . In Norfolk , the storm was the longest @-@ lasting and most damaging since the Great Beaufort Hurricane of 1879 . The storm conditions made beaches in the area so hazardous that they were watched day and night . Effects from the storm reached as far north as Provincetown , Massachusetts , where winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) were recorded . 
 Despite causing damage along the East Coast , the storm is best known for causing a record number of maritime incidents . Numerous ships were caught in the storm from October 30 , when the steamship Claribel reported gale @-@ force winds , to November 6 , when another steamship , the Australia , reported stormy weather . One ship , the brig Osseo , was caught in the storm on November 1 and became flooded . Although the pumps were manned , the water level inside the ship soon reached 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) . After being carried away by a wave , the distressed ship was spotted by the <unk> , which rescued the crew and brought them to port . Another vessel , the <unk> , spotted a sunken schooner with its five crew grasping the mast and ropes : they were also rescued . In addition , four ships were deemed total losses after being beached in Virginia . The first was the Mary D. Cranmer , which was ripped from its cables and stranded near Cape Henry . Shortly after the rescue of the crew of the Cranmer another ship , the Carrie Holmes , was found beached . The ship had been driven so far up the beach that its crew were able to jump and wade to safety . 
 A third ship , the Manantico also crashed into shore due to a combination of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner . The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred . The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship . The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar . The captain , who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety , began climbing down to slip the ship cables , but the ship made a sudden stop . This flung the captain into the water , and he drowned . Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured . The captain was sent to Middletown , Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach . The final ship was the Harriet Thomas , which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico . After beaching , the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end . The crew were able to climb ashore , although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method . The ship was written off as a $ 7000 ( 1887 USD ) loss . Although all four ships were beached , due to the loss of communications , only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper . As a result , news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported . 
 = Rajasaurus = 
 Rajasaurus ( ' Raja ' meaning " king " ( derived from Sanskrit ) here , " king of lizards " ) is a genus of carnivorous <unk> theropod dinosaur with an unusual head crest . Between 1982 and 1984 , its fossilized bones were discovered by Suresh Srivastava of the Geological Survey of India ( GSI ) . Excavated from the Narmada River valley in Rahioli in the <unk> district of Gujarat , India , the find was announced as a new genus of dinosaur by American and Indian scientists on August 13 , 2003 . 
 Paleontologists Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago , Jeff Wilson of the University of Michigan , and Srivastava worked together as an Indo – American group to study the Narmada River fossils . The fossils represented the partial skeleton of the new species Rajasaurus <unk> , which means " princely lizard from the Narmada Valley . " The fossilized bones of Rajasaurus have also been found in the upriver region of the Narmada , at Jabalpur , in the state of Madhya Pradesh . 
 = = Description = = 
 Rajasaurus was an abelisaurid , a member of a group of theropod predators known to have lived only on landmasses that were part of the supercontinent Gondwana , such as Africa , India , Madagascar , and South America . Rajasaurus closely resembles Majungasaurus , a contemporary abelisaur from Madagascar , an island that had separated from the Indian landmass about 20 million years earlier . It was found to be an abelisaurid through a phylogenetic analysis of anatomical characteristics , and was described as a <unk> abelisaurid ( the subfamily including Carnotaurus ) because of the configuration of its nasal bones and its possession of a growth ( " excrescence " ) on its frontal bone . Rajasaurus is distinguished from other genera by its single nasal @-@ frontal horn , the elongated proportions of its supratemporal fenestrae ( holes in the upper rear of the skull ) , and the form of the ilia ( principle bones of the hip ) which feature a transverse ridge separating the brevis shelf from the hip joint . 
 Rajasaurus was identified from a partial skeleton including a part of the skull ( braincase ) , backbone , hip bones , parts of the hind legs and tail . This specimen , GSI <unk> / 1 – 33 , serves as the type specimen of the genus and species . Rajasaurus measured about 7 @.@ 6 – 9 m ( 24 @.@ 9 – 29 @.@ 5 ft ) long and what is preserved of the skull shows it bore a distinctive low rounded horn , made up of outgrowths from the nasal and frontal bones . 
 = = History of discovery = = 
 The Narmada River in central India drains its valley from east to west , in a rift valley and eventually into the Arabian Sea after traveling 1 @,@ 312 km ( 815 @.@ 2 mi ) . Dinosaur bones have been reported from the Narmada valley since the late 19th century , including some belonging to Titanosaurus indicus . 
 The history of the fossils named Rajasaurus begins in 1981 . When G.N. Dwivedi and D.M. <unk> , geologists of the Geological Survey of India , were on a mapping mission , the workers of the ACC Cement quarry at Rahioli , in Gujarat showed them smooth ball @-@ like limestone structures from the quarry . These " balls " turned out to be dinosaurian eggs . The geologists also found that the limestone bed containing the fossilized eggs was underlain by a layer of coarse sandstone and conglomerate with abundant dinosaurian fossil bones . 
 During the years 1982 – 84 Suresh Srivastava , a GSI geologist at the Palaeontology Division of the GSI 's Western Region , collected large numbers of bone fossil fragments from Rahioli , and also precisely mapped the area . These fossils were taken to the Palaeontology Division at Jaipur for identification . U. B. Mathur and Suresh Srivastava , under the supervision of S. C. Pant , meticulously cleaned many of the skeletal parts ( braincase , dorsal and caudal vertebrae , sacrum , thigh bone , upper arm , shin bones , and others ) , leading to the publication of multiple research papers . There was a lull in further activity until a Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) was signed with Punjab University in 1994 – 95 . 
 In 2001 , further research on the fossils was continued by two American scientists sponsored by the American Institute of Indian Studies , New Delhi and the National Geographic Society , U.S.A. The Americans , Paul Sereno and Jeff Wilson , started the reconstruction of the collection of dinosaur bones gathered in 1983 and 1984 . The team of scientists , after a detailed study of the maps prepared earlier by Srivastava , were able to reconstruct the partial skull , left and right hip bones , and a sacrum . They interpreted the part of a skull and a horn as resembling those of dinosaurs found in Madagascar . Fossils of Rajasaurus were also found near Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh . In all , the collected fossils include a partial skull , limb bones , hip bones , and vertebrae . 
 Although Rajasaurus was formally described in 2003 , there are fossils described in 1923 that may belong to this genus . Charles Alfred <unk> described <unk> indicus in that year from specimens including an ilium , a sacrum , a shin bone , and armor scutes found at Bara Simla . <unk> was later shown to be a chimera , and Wilson et al. suggested that the ilium and sacrum ( now lost ) were exemplars of the similarly stout Rajasaurus . 
 The discovery of Rajasaurus could lead to additional information on the evolutionary relationships of <unk> , since previously described specimens from India were mainly isolated bones . At a press conference held in 2003 on the discovery of Rajasaurus , Sereno stated : 
 The discovery , which will be put for examination before global experts , was important since it would help in adding to the current knowledge of dinosaur belonging to the family of <unk> predators and adding a new angle to dinosaurs in the Indian subcontinent . 
 = = Palaeobiology = = 
 Rajasaurus is known only from the Indian Peninsula . At the time it was alive , the Indian landmass had recently separated from the rest of Gondwana and was moving north . While Rajasaurus had evolved along its own direction , it was still similar to other abelisaurids such as Majungasaurus from Madagascar and Carnotaurus from South America ; these animals descended from a common lineage . 
 Rajasaurus has been found in the Lameta Formation . This rock unit represents a forested setting of rivers and lakes that formed between episodes of volcanism . The volcanic rocks are now known as the Deccan Traps . <unk> and sauropod fossils are known from river and lake deposits that were quickly buried by Deccan volcanic flows . Other dinosaurs from the Lameta Formation include the noasaurid <unk> , abelisaurids Indosaurus and <unk> , and the titanosaurian sauropods Jainosaurus , Titanosaurus , and <unk> . 
 Coprolites have been recorded in the Lameta Formation , and the presence of fungi in coprolites indicates that leaves were eaten by the dinosaurs which lived in a tropical or subtropical climate . Another scientific study of similarities in egg taxa suggested close phyletic relationships that supports the existence of a terrestrial connection between dinosaurian fauna in India and Europe during the Cretaceous , and between two Gondwanan areas , Patagonia and India . 
 = = Cultural significance = = 
 In order to educate people about extinct forms of life , the Geological Survey of India installed life – size fibreglass models of Rajasaurus and Titanosaurus at their Lucknow regional office . The installation is presented in an appropriate setting , with representations of plants that existed during the Mesozoic Era . Also displayed are limb bones , vertebra , eggs and coprolites of sauropod dinosaurs and fossil eggs of Rajasaurus collected from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh . 
 A restored skull of Rajasaurus is a prominent exhibit in the Indian Museum at Kolkata . 
 Also interested in Rajasaurus is Aliya Babi ( of the erstwhile royal family of <unk> ) , who became a dinosaur enthusiast after closely watching the efforts made by GSI at Rahioli to unearth the fossils , and made efforts to promote dinosaur tourism to Rahioli in order to showcase its millions of years of dinosaur heritage . She also set up a small museum at her hotel . 
 A Jurassic Ride Rajasaurus River Adventure has been launched at the Adlabs Imagica , India . The ride is inspired by Jurassic Park : The Ride located at Universal Parks . 
 = Govindudu Andarivadele = 
 Govindudu Andarivadele ( English : The lord is a people 's man ) , also known by the acronym GAV , is a 2014 Indian Telugu @-@ language drama film written and directed by Krishna Vamsi and produced by Bandla Ganesh for Parameswara Art Productions . The film features Ram Charan , Srikanth , Kajal Aggarwal and Kamalinee Mukherjee in the lead roles , while Prakash Raj , Jayasudha , Rahman and Adarsh Balakrishna play supporting roles . Yuvan Shankar Raja composed the film 's soundtrack and score while Sameer Reddy worked as the cinematographer . 
 The film is partially inspired by the 1991 Telugu film Seetharamaiah Gari Manavaralu directed by <unk> Kumar . Govindudu Andarivadele portrays a " non @-@ residential Indian " named Abhiram who visits his grandfather Balaraju 's house as a student of agriculture . He actually came to reconcile the differences between his father , Chandrasekhar Rao , and Balaraju .

 In September 2010 , Chiranjeevi invited Krishna Vamsi to discuss making a movie with Ram Charan as the lead . After a story @-@ narration session , they agreed to move ahead . In August 2013 , after a three @-@ year gap , it was announced that Ram Charan , Daggubati Venkatesh and Krishna would act in a film directed by Vamsi and produced by Bandla Ganesh under the banner Parameswara Art Productions banner . At that point , however , the script was not yet complete and so the project was still put on hold . 
 In December 2013 , Bandla Ganesh tweeted a photo featuring himself , Krishna Vamsi and Director of Photography Sameer Reddy at the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple in <unk> with the finished script . The film was initially titled <unk> after the 1985 Telugu film which featured Chiranjeevi and <unk> in the lead roles . In March 2014 , the supposed story of the film was leaked onto the internet . The story was that Ram Charan played the role of an NRI who visits his joint family to bridge a gap between his father and his father 's younger brother . 
 On 27 March 2014 , when the film poster was released , the title was confirmed as Govindudu Andarivadele . In mid April 2014 , Yuvan Shankar Raja was signed up as the film 's composer after S. Thaman opted out because of conflicting projects . Sources reported that talks were also held with G. V. Prakash Kumar . It was the first time that Krishna Vamsi had collaborated with Yuvan Shankar Raja , with the director later informing that he had waited five years to work with the composer . Reports regarding Rajkiran being replaced by Prakash Raj because of Chiranjeevi and the altering of the original script , and that Prakash Raj was included to strengthen the Telugu cultural identity of the film were dismissed as rumours . The film 's shoot was put on hold due to the climate at the shooting spot being unsuitable for children acting in the film rather than because of Chiranjeevi . Ram Charan , in an interview with The Hindu , said that Rajkiran was replaced with Prakash Raj as the sections involving the former ended up looking more like a Tamil film . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Vamsi wanted to cast a popular actor as the protagonist to widen the film 's appeal , and approached Ram Charan because of his relationship with him since Charan 's childhood . Venkatesh and Krishna were initially set to play the lead roles along with Charan , with Venkatesh playing the role of Charan 's paternal uncle . In September 2013 , Kajal Aggarwal was signed to play opposite Charan . Actor <unk> Babu turned down the role of Charan 's father as he wanted to concentrate on antagonistic character roles . 
 In November 2013 , Tamil actor Rajkiran was chosen to play the role of Charan 's grandfather , previously earmarked for Krishna . The producers also began searching for a new actress in the lead role . In December 2013 , Venkatesh left the project and was subsequently replaced by Telugu actor Srikanth , saying that the role did not suit his image rather than any other dissatisfaction . <unk> Choudary was rumoured to have been signed up as the female lead , but this proved not to be the case . Tamannaah was approached as well , but she had prior commitments in Aagadu and Baahubali . Kajal was finalised by the end of 2013 as Charan 's heroine in this film , marking her return to Telugu Cinema after a brief hiatus . 
 <unk> Mukherjee was chosen by Krishna Vamsi in late January 2014 by Krishna Vamsi , mainly because of her appearance and her acting talent . A song from rock band " The Tapes " took seven to nine hours to film for a sequence in the film featuring Charan and Kajal . This was the band 's first onscreen appearance . Vennela Kishore confirmed his presence in the film twice through his Twitter account . 
 In the end of May 2014 , Prakash Raj replaced Rajkiran as Ram Charan 's grandfather . Vamsi said " Raj Kiran was cast initially and I had doubts about this casting . After shooting a few scenes , I went to Chiranjeevi and he suggested , ' You can think of taking someone who can carry Telugu nativity . ' He just made that suggestion , but that was when I replaced Raj Kiran with Prakash Raj " . He added that Chiranjeevi did not interfere in this decision . However , Chiranjeevi helped Vamsi and Raj reconcile their differences . Jayasudha and Rahman were signed for key roles . M. S. Narayana was selected to play a supporting role . Adarsh Balakrishna was selected to portray the film 's antagonist , recommended by Srikanth to Vamsi . 
 = = = Characterisation and costume designing = = = 
 Ram Charan 's character was Abhiram , an NRI who goes from London to India in search of his roots . He was depicted as the star player of a Rugby League player at Hemel Hempstead Charan grew a ponytail and appeared in traditional Telugu costume , wearing a dhoti for some scenes in the film , contrasting with the modern clothes he wore in previous films . He also learnt stick fighting skills for the film . 
 Vamsi showed Charan a lot of family dramas , drove him to villages to help him understand the atmosphere and mindset of the people . According to Vamsi , Charan " comes across as a shy and reserved guy but has a fun and family loving side to him " , which he tried to show onscreen . Srikanth played the role of Charan 's younger paternal uncle and wore his hair long for the role . His costume was rustic in appearance . A still of him in costume was shown in the end of July 2014 . His " crucial role " in the film was aggressive and rebellious . 
 Kajal Aggarwal revealed one of her outfits in the film on 27 July 2014 would be a black half @-@ sari . Jayasudha was selected to play the role of Prakash Raj 's wife in the film while Rahman was signed in to play the role of Ram Charan 's father . <unk> Mukherjee 's character was named Chitra , a rural girl quite unlike the urbane roles she had played in the past . Adarsh Balakrishna , cast as a flashy M. P. ' s son living in the same village , wore jewellery with Indian costume , again with long hair . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography began on 6 February 2014 in Hyderabad and continued for 3 days there before a long pre @-@ planned schedule started in Rameswaram , Nagercoil and Pollachi . Kajal joined the sets of the film in Hyderabad on 9 February 2014 and some scenes between herself and Charan were shot there . They also participated in the film 's shoot at Nagercoil near Kanyakumari in mid February 2014 after the completion of the schedule at Rameswaram . A fight sequence with Charan , Srikanth and others was filmed at Kanyakumari before shifting to Pollachi . A few action sequences focusing Charan were shot at Pollachi in late March 2014 . He also worked on some key action sequences for the film under the supervision of Ram Lakshman in mid May 2014 , for which a special set was built . Some song sequences were shot in Malaysia from 2 June 2014 . 
 The film 's shoot continued in Hyderabad from 5 June 2014 and the team planned to go to London after filming some family scenes at the special house set constructed earlier in Ramanaidu Cine Village in Hyderabad . 30 scenes and 2 songs were shot in that house set in Hyderabad over a period of 45 days . Prakash Raj allotted bulk dates and the reshoot took 8 days only and not 20 days as earlier reported . After completing the shoot of few scenes and a montage song , the first part of the film 's Hyderabad schedule ended on 18 June 2014 . The next part commenced on 21 June 2014 . At the end of June 2014 , another song was shot on a special set featuring mirrors , in which the lead pair participated . Due to incessant rain at Pollachi , the shooting continued at Hyderabad , delaying the planned schedule . The Pollachi schedule therefore began on 23 July 2014 , lasting for 5 days . A fresh schedule began in Karaikudi on whose completion , filming continued in Hyderabad from 4 August 2014 . The film 's shoot was temporarily halted on 19 August 2014 because of the statewide survey in Telangana . 
 The next schedule began in London on 22 August 2014 . A romantic song was shot on Charan and Kajal in early September 2014 in Jordan . After its completion , a song was shot with the lead pair in London . The production unit returned to Hyderabad on 14 September 2014 . A quarter of the film was shot in London . Charan 's introduction scene was shot at the Pennine Way Stadium , and a rugby match was shot at the Rugby League club in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire in south @-@ eastern England . To add some authenticity , the local club captain B. J. <unk> was brought on board . Two songs sequences were shot simultaneously in Hyderabad . 
 The principal photography ended on 22 September 2014 on completion of the songs shoot . However , it was officially announced later that the film would be released without a song which would be shot on 2 and 3 October and then be added to the film .

 The film 's dubbing activities commenced at <unk> Studios in Hyderabad on 18 July 2014 . The supporting cast then dubbed their respective roles . Yuvan Shankar Raja started re @-@ recording for the film 's first half on 26 August 2014 at his studio in Chennai . Srikanth completed dubbing for his role on 10 September 2014 and Charan completed dubbing on 24 September 2014 . Chiranjeevi personally monitored the post @-@ production works and promotion strategies . In an interview with the Deccan Chronicle , Chiranjeevi mentioned that Charan also participated in the production and editing of the film 's trailer and took extra care of the trailer 's release and had asked him to check if everything was right . While shooting two songs at Hyderabad , the post production works were completed . 
 A copy of the film was sent to Central Board of Film Certification on 26 September 2014 . The same day , the film was awarded an ' U / A ' certificate instead of a clean ' U ' due to some sections and scenes between the lead actors . The Board asked the makers to obtain a No Objection Certificate from Animal Welfare Board of India to retain scenes featuring animals . They muted a few dialogues as well as " backless " views of the heroine . They also insisted on obscuring the brands on alcoholic drinks as well as the display of mandatory warnings " when Srikanth is smoking " .

He added that this film was made to showcase the folk arts , music and spirituality of the Telugu people .

 Mit Gas is the second studio album by the musical supergroup Tomahawk . It was released on May 6 , 2003 , through Ipecac Recordings , the record label owned by vocalist Mike Patton . Mit Gas charted in several countries , reaching the top 20 in Norway 's VG @-@ lista and the United States ' Billboard Independent Albums charts . 
 Recorded after an unreceptive tour with the band Tool , Mit Gas has been described by critics as a more focused and unified album than its predecessor , Tomahawk . The album was supported by a tour alongside Melvins , Skeleton Key and Dälek . Mit Gas has garnered positive reviews , drawing comparisons to the works of Frank Zappa , Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin . 
 = = Production = = 
 Tomahawk is a musical supergroup consisting of Mike Patton , vocalist for Faith No More and Mr. Bungle ; Duane Denison , guitarist for The Jesus Lizard ; Kevin Rutmanis , bass player for Melvins ; and John Stanier , drummer for Helmet . Mit Gas was recorded after they toured with the band Tool , whose fans frequently booed Tomahawk off stage during their performances . Denison has likened the experience of playing to the unreceptive and uninterested crowds as similar to " being pro @-@ choice at a [ then @-@ US president ] Bush rally and trying to make your point " . Subsequently , the band opted to organize their own tour in support of the album , choosing to work with Melvins , Skeleton Key and Dälek . Speaking about the planning required to stage a four @-@ act tour , Patton stated " that 's a lot of music . That 's a lot of time to be sitting in some stinking @-@ ass club with some guy puking in your purse " . Tool 's guitarist Adam Jones offered to direct a video , but the offer was declined by the band . Reports suggested that a cover of the theme from the movie Flashdance What a Feeling was going to be included on the album , although the song was not on the final track listing .

 Reviews of Mit Gas have been positive . Writing for AllRovi , Daphne Carr awarded the album a rating of four stars out of five , adding that it " expand [ s ] the borders of guitar rock with intelligence and humor " . Carr felt that " You Can 't Win " and " Rape This Day " were among the album 's best songs , and compared the overall sound to the work of avant @-@ garde musician Frank Zappa . Pitchfork Media 's Scott Hreha rated the album 8 @.@ 4 out of 10 , finding that the band seemed to compliment each other musically more than they had on their previous album . Hreha singled out " You Can 't Win " , " Mayday " and " Rape This Day " as highlights of the record , and praised the album 's ability to " straddle the distance between ambience and onslaught " . Stephen Hang of PopMatters felt that the album was rewarding but challenging to listeners , and that Patton 's lyrics were deliberately obtuse . Hang was positive about the album 's sound , but described the release as having " deliver [ ed ] the goods for Patton ’ s small , devoted cult audience " . 
 Spin magazine awarded the album a " B − " rating , describing it as " heavy on nuts and bolts , light on bolts from the blue " . The reviewer felt that the group 's lineup suggested a greater potential than the resultant album offered , but called it " solid " nonetheless . Matt Rhodes , writing for Consequence of Sound , reviewed the album positively , stating that " frankly , this album sounds like dark , kinky sex " . Rhodes compared it to the works of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin , and felt that Denison 's guitar parts served to specifically compliment Patton 's vocals , rather than attempting to stand out for themselves . Tom Mallon of CMJ New Music Monthly felt that the album presented a more cohesive group than was present on Tomahawk , allowing the band to " [ step ] out of the shadows " of their previous careers . Mallon praised Patton 's vocal performances , finding them to be his most diverse work since the 1999 Mr. Bungle album California .

 = Battle of Burton Bridge ( 1643 ) = 
 The Battle of Burton Bridge was fought between Royalist and Parliamentarian forces at Burton upon Trent on 4 July 1643 during the First English Civil War . By the time of the battle the town , which had at various times been held by both sides , was garrisoned by a Parliamentarian unit under the command of Captain Thomas Sanders and the town 's military governor , Colonel Richard Houghton . The key river crossing at Burton was desired by Queen Henrietta Maria , who was proceeding southwards from Yorkshire with a convoy of supplies destined for King Charles I at Oxford . The Royalists , led by Colonel Thomas Tyldesley , launched a cavalry charge across the bridge which succeeded in defeating the Parliamentarians and capturing most of their officers , including Sanders and Houghton . The Queen 's convoy proceeded on its way south to Oxford with Tyldesley receiving a knighthood and a promotion in recognition of his victory . Burton changed hands several more times during the course of the war , before finally coming into Parliament 's control in 1646 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The county of Staffordshire , several days travel from the main seat of power in London , had a long @-@ standing disinclination to paying taxes and levies imposed by the King . James I 's Privy Council was forced to write to the county 's Justices of the Peace for their failure to raise a single penny to support the King 's campaign to reclaim the Palatinate in Germany for his son @-@ in @-@ law Frederick V in the 1620s . The county was also slow to pay Charles I 's ship money which began to be levied ( in defiance of the Parliament ) on the inland counties in 1634 and saw much resistance . Open dissent against the King 's decrees occurred in 1640 in objection to the levying of 300 men from the county for the King 's campaign against the Scots . Riots took place in Uttoxeter with an armed guard having to be formed to prevent the levy from deserting . 
 Upon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 the town of Burton was largely sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause . This was probably , in part , due to the large Puritan following in the town and Staffordshire 's general disapproval of the High Church practices of the then Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud ( who was later executed for his opposition of Puritanism ) . 
 = = Early @-@ war Burton = = 
 Burton 's river crossing , a 36 @-@ arched medieval structure known as " Burton Bridge " , was desirable to both sides , being described as " the only passage over the Trent and Dove to the North " , and was positioned between the Royalist towns of Lichfield , Tutbury , and Ashby @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Zouch and Parliamentarian Stafford and Derby . Despite this strategic location the town was unfortified and possessed few natural defences . Burton would change hands at least a dozen times during the course of the war , first coming to the attention of the Royalists when the Earl of Chesterfield used it as a rendezvous for his forces in late 1642 . Chesterfield withdrew his forces to Lichfield for the winter , garrisoning the cathedral which would be the scene of much fighting during the war . There were rumours prior to the war that the town held secret supplies of gunpowder for a catholic rebellion , these were investigated by Lord Paget ( who began the war as a parliamentarian , switched allegiance to the King in 1642 before returning to the side of Parliament in 1644 ) and found to be false , though the explosion of a store of gunpowder did occur in 1643 causing the roof of St Modwen 's Church to be destroyed . 
 East Staffordshire 's strategic importance was heightened by its position at the boundary of Royalist and Parliamentarian garrisons in the region . Burton had come to roundhead attention in early 1643 after the establishment of a garrison at nearby Derby by the county committee leader , Sir John Gell . In February Gell placed a garrison across the county border at Burton , consisting of an infantry company under Dutch Major Johannes <unk> , but withdrew it less than a month later to assist in an attack on Newark . 
 Parliament 's forces in Staffordshire and Warwickshire were initially under the command of Lord Brooke but after his death during the successful siege of Lichfield Cathedral in March 1643 Gell was appointed as his replacement . Gell 's forces now amounted to around 1 @,@ 000 infantry , a few horse and 300 partially armed Staffordshire <unk> and he met with Sir William Brereton , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of Cheshire , to organise an attack upon Stafford . This became known to the Royalists and the Earl of Northampton was sent with two fast @-@ moving cavalry regiments to thwart Gell and Brereton 's plan . Northampton met with troops led by Henry Hastings ( later Lord Loughborough ) and garrisoned Tamworth before engaging Gell at the inconclusive Battle of Hopton Heath , during which Northampton was killed . 
 During this time Queen Henrietta Maria landed at Bridlington , Yorkshire with a supply of weapons purchased abroad that she intended to bring to the King , who was then in Oxford . In advance of this the King sent his nephew , Prince Rupert of the Rhine , from Oxford with 1 @,@ 200 horse , 700 foot and 6 cannon to clear South Staffordshire . Prince Rupert 's troops evicted garrisons from Rushall and Birmingham and successfully recaptured Lichfield . Rupert placed Royalist garrison in key towns including Burton to secure the route of Henrietta 's convoy . The garrison at Burton was soon driven out once more by Gell , acting in co @-@ operation with Lord Grey , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the East Midlands Association . He placed his own garrison there of 200 infantry , 60 dragoons and a cannon from Derbyshire before proceeding with the remainder of his force to Tutbury Castle which he unsuccessfully attacked . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Gell 's garrison at Burton was commanded by Captain Thomas Sanders , who had previously commanded one of the largest companies in Gell 's force . Sanders held more radical political views than Gell and was seen as a potential rival . Sanders may have been concerned that his deployment to such a precarious position was a plot by Gell to be rid of him . Whatever the case Sanders decided to remove himself from Gell 's command and place him and his men under the direction of Colonel Richard Houghton , of the Staffordshire county committee and military governor of Burton . 
 In July 1643 the Queen 's convoy and its guard advanced from Newark to Ashby @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Zouch and then to Burton . Gell summoned the Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire associations forces to defend the town but they refused to muster for him . On 4 July 1643 the <unk> cavalry , led by Colonel Thomas Tyldesley , charged across Burton Bridge and engaged Sanders ' men . The engagement was described as " bloody " and " desperate " and , though damage was caused to the town 's St Modwen 's church , the battle seems to have been decided by the action at the bridge . The forces of parliament were decisively beaten and , according to Gell , the town was " most miserably plundered and destroyed " . Henrietta Maria herself recorded that so much loot was taken that her men " could not well march with their bundles " . 
 The Royalists claimed that they had twice requested the surrender of the town before they attacked and that the Queen forbade any violence against the townsfolk . Conversely the parliamentarians claimed that 30 of their men were forced into the church and offered to surrender but were refused and were killed by cavaliers in the night . The Royalists were also alleged to have looted the town and raped women before drowning at least 20 civilians in the river . The Royalists took most of the Roundhead officers prisoner including Captain Sanders and Colonel Houghton ( and his wife ) . Sanders was later exchanged and was promoted to Major by the Earl of Essex and commissioned by Gell to act as Colonel and to raise a regiment of horse . Tyldesley was knighted and promoted to brigadier @-@ general for bravery shown in the action . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Having lost Burton , Gell feared an attack upon Derby and withdrew troops from Nottingham and Leicester to defend it . He was also able to secure supplies of 20 barrels of powder , 300 muskets , 60 carbines and 60 cases of pistols and an additional troop of horses , allowing him to arm his regiment fully for the first time . However Derby was not attacked by the Queen 's forces who bypassed it and moved through Walsall , proceeding according to the King 's instructions to avoid delays . 
 The new Royalist garrison in Burton fortified the bridge and maintained control of the town until driven out by Gell in January 1644 . During this attack Gell took the commanding officer ( a Major ) , six captains , eight other officers and 500 men prisoner . Burton Bridge was again a focal point of the assault with five Royalists losing their lives there , with Gell claiming that he lost no men in the attack . Gell withdrew with his prisoners to Derby , allowing Lord Loughborough to retake the town and bridge which he intended to hold as a means of communication between his " flying army " at Ashby and the Royalist garrisons in Tutbury and Derbyshire . 
 A Parliamentarian raid again attacked and plundered the town in April 1644 , afterwards ceding control to the Royalists once more , before Sanders ' newly raised regiment of 400 horse retook it narrowly failing to capture Loughborough himself . Parliament troops from Derbyshire and Staffordshire were established as a garrison in November 1644 but were driven out by Royalists by February 1645 . King Charles I briefly made Burton his headquarters in May of that year before the town was retaken for the final time by Parliament in early 1646 , becoming a centre of supply of coin and beer to the forces besieging Tutbury and Lichfield . After the war and the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 Burton remained a place of dissent and nonconformism with large Presbyterian and Baptist congregations , raising doubts within the Church of England over the town 's loyalty .

 The medieval bridge over which the battle was fought was replaced in the Victorian era . A plaque commemorating the battle was erected on the bridge on 2 July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley 's Regiment of the English Civil War Society ( the umbrella group for English Civil War re @-@ enactors ) . Another monument erected at the site of Tyldesley 's death at the Battle of Wigan Lane by one of his cornets , Alexander Rigby , in 1679 notes his " desperate storming of Burton @-@ Upon @-@ Trent over a bridge of 36 arches [ for which Tyldesley ] received the honour of Knighthood " . In honour of the battle the Burton Bridge Brewery markets an ale known as " Battle Brew " . A local legend states that Oliver Cromwell was present in the area during the battle and tied his horse to a nail at Tatenhill 's St Michael 's and All Angels Church , just 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the bridge . The medieval Burton bridge was the site of an earlier battle in 1322 where Edward II defeated the rebellious Earl of Lancaster . 
 = Sid Barnes = 
 Sidney George Barnes ( 5 June 1916 – 16 December 1973 ) was an Australian cricketer and cricket writer , who played 13 Test matches between 1938 and 1948 . Able to open the innings or bat down the order , Barnes was regarded as one of Australia 's finest batsmen in the period immediately following the Second World War . He helped create an enduring record when scoring 234 in the second Test against England at Sydney in December 1946 ; exactly the same score as his captain , Don Bradman , in the process setting a world @-@ record 405 run fifth wicket partnership . Barnes averaged 63 @.@ 05 over 19 innings in a career that , like those of most of his contemporaries , was interrupted by the Second World War . 
 He made his first @-@ class début at the end of the 1936 – 37 season when selected for New South Wales and was later included in the team for the 1938 Australian tour of England , making his Test début in the final international of the series . On the resumption of Test cricket after the war , he was picked as the opening partner to Arthur Morris . Barnes was a member of The Invincibles , the 1948 Australian team that toured England without losing a single match . Retiring from cricket at the end of that tour , Barnes attempted a comeback to Test cricket in the 1951 – 52 season that was ultimately and controversially unsuccessful . 
 Barnes had a reputation as an eccentric and was frequently the subject of controversy . This included a celebrated libel case , following his exclusion from the national team in 1951 – 52 for " reasons other than cricket ability " . He was later involved in an incident where , acting as twelfth man , he performed his duties on the ground in a suit and tie ( rather than ' whites ' ) , carrying a bizarre range of superfluous items . Despite this reputation , Barnes was a shrewd businessman who used the opportunities afforded by cricket to supplement his income through trading , journalism and property development . Increasing paranoia brought about by bipolar disorder saw Barnes lose many of the friends he had made through the game , as he sought treatment for his depression . On 16 December 1973 , he was found dead at his home in the Sydney suburb of Collaroy ; he had ingested barbiturates and bromide in a probable suicide .

 Barnes was born in 1916 in Annandale , an inner suburb of Sydney . However , in his autobiography , he claims to have been born in 1918 or 1919 in Queensland , and his military service record has his date of birth as 5 June 1917 . He was the third child of Alfred Percival Barnes and Hilda May Barnes ( née Jeffery ) , both from farming families near Tamworth in northern New South Wales . After marrying , the couple left Tamworth to take up a lease on a remote sheep station near Hughenden in North Queensland . Before Sid was born , Alfred died from typhoid fever , caused by drinking contaminated water on the family property . After his death , Hilda , widowed and pregnant with her latest child , moved to Sydney with her children and stayed with her sister , where Sid was born . From her husband 's estate , Hilda Barnes mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in Stanmore and Leichhardt , New South Wales , to let or sell . Later in life , Barnes would recount how , as a child , he used to collect the rents for his mother . 
 = = = Childhood and club cricket = = = 
 Barnes attended Stanmore Public School and , although not a scholar , was a keen participant in sporting activities . His introduction to cricket came via his older brother , Horrie ; Horrie was a useful batsman who played in the local Western Suburbs Churches league and paid Sid sixpence to bowl to him after he finished work . Taking an interest in the game , Sid had trials for the school team and was eventually selected in the first XI . An early controversy saw Barnes suspended for three weeks for disputing an umpire 's decision . Successes for both his school team and his local club team , St. Augustine , saw him acquire the nickname The Governor @-@ General — the nickname of Australian Test player , Charlie Macartney , and he was selected for New South Wales Schoolboys to play teams from Victoria and Queensland . 
 In 1932 – 33 , Barnes joined the Petersham club , and began playing in the third XI . Former Test batsman Tommy Andrews became his mentor at the club and in 1933 – 34 , Barnes made his first @-@ grade cricket début as a batsman / wicket @-@ keeper against Paddington , facing the bowling of Hunter Hendry and Alan McGilvray . He was soon successful , scoring a century against Manly in February . Even as a young and inexperienced cricketer , he showed a " ... brash confidence in his own ability . " When praised for his batting by the great Test bowler Bill O 'Reilly , Barnes responded " Thanks very much , you didn 't bowl too badly yourself " , leaving O 'Reilly speechless . 
 This success led Barnes to consider cricket as a potential career . However , his mother and stepfather were concerned about the likelihood of cricket providing him with a living . In response , Barnes took a job with a garage in Mosman but after finding that the necessary travel interfered too much with playing cricket , he found alternative employment , demonstrating motorbikes in the city . 
 = = = First @-@ class cricket = = = 
 Barnes had come to the attention of the New South Wales selectors by the 1936 – 37 season and was included as twelfth man in the side to play the visiting English side , taking a catch on the boundary to dismiss Stan Worthington . He made his first @-@ class début in the final Sheffield Shield match of the season , against South Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Batting at number five , Barnes scored 31 and 44 , twice being dismissed LBW by the leg spinner Frank Ward . Whilst fielding , Barnes managed to find himself in controversy again , running out Vic Richardson , the opposition captain , after the end of the over was called . The square leg umpire had not heard the call of " Over " and upheld the appeal , much to the disgust of Richardson . The New South Wales captain Stan McCabe , whom Barnes idolised , withdrew the appeal . 
 Barnes was selected for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937 – 38 season against Queensland making 68 in a rain @-@ affected match . Against the touring New Zealanders , Barnes fell just short of his maiden first @-@ class century , scoring 97 . He appeared to have reached the landmark when scoring 127 not out against Western Australia , but the New South Wales Cricket Association retrospectively deemed the match to be not of first @-@ class status , angering Barnes . He finally scored his maiden first @-@ class century ( 110 ) against Victoria in the final game of the season , completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by Ernie McCormick . As a result of his performances over the season ( scoring over 800 runs , averaging 50 @.@ 56 ) , Barnes was selected as the youngest member of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938 .

 Unfortunately for Barnes , he broke his wrist while exercising on the sea voyage to England for the 1938 tour , keeping the injury secret until the tourists had departed Gibraltar , for fear of being sent home . On arrival in England , he therefore did not play an innings until the last day of June , missing exactly half of the 30 first @-@ class matches scheduled for the tour , including the first two Tests , both of which were drawn . His first innings was 42 against Derbyshire and he shared in a fourth wicket stand of 176 with Bill Brown , who made an unbeaten 265 . The third Test was a wash @-@ out and he was not picked for the fourth , which the Australians won , although in his autobiography he claimed that he was considered as a candidate to be wicketkeeper , having deputised for Ben Barnett in that role in tour matches against Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire . In the event , his Test début came in the final Test , played at The Oval . Barnes had to field for 16 hours as England amassed a total of 903 for seven declared , then the highest Test score . Barnes bowled 38 overs in the innings and took the seventh wicket , that of Arthur Wood , for 84 runs . With both Don Bradman and Jack Fingleton injured and unable to bat , Australia struggled – England won by an innings and 579 runs – still the largest winning margin in Test cricket history ; but Barnes played innings of 41 and 33 and , according to Wisden , " well justified his choice " . In all first @-@ class matches on the tour , Barnes scored 720 runs , and reached 90 three times , though without going on to a first @-@ class century . He scored 140 in a two @-@ day match against Durham , which was not considered first @-@ class . 
 His international career was then put on hold , as all foreign tours were suspended during the Second World War . He continued to play first @-@ class cricket in Australia , before enlisting in the Second Australian Imperial Force in May 1942 . Barnes 's time in the military was short . A man who was proud of his appearance , he had a uniform made to measure when the one issued did not fit . He met champion golfer Norman Von Nida early into his enlistment and the two were assigned to the 1st Armoured Division in Greta . A shortage of tanks and the military regimen led to boredom and Barnes used his hitherto ignored trade background to his advantage , seeking a release to join a tank @-@ making company , which was granted . Von Nida and Barnes remained friends and business partners for many years afterwards . 
 = = = Post @-@ war series = = = 
 After scoring 1 @,@ 050 runs ( including six centuries ) at an average of 75 @.@ 00 in the 1940 – 41 season , Barnes played little cricket until 1945 – 46 , when he scored centuries in five successive matches for New South Wales . He was picked for the 1945 – 46 Australian tour of New Zealand and played in the representative match that was later designated as the first Test match between the two countries : he made 54 as Australia won easily . The post @-@ war period also saw a new approach to batting on the part of Barnes . He discarded his aggressive and flamboyant shot @-@ making and re @-@ invented himself as a watchful , more defensive player , which made his scoring more prolific , although less crowd pleasing . 
 Barnes was made captain of New South Wales for the 1946 – 47 Australian season , though he only managed to play three matches for the state team . One of those was the match against the touring MCC team , and Barnes was approached during the match about becoming an opening batsman for the forthcoming Test series . He wrote in his autobiography : " I had never opened before and was a little dubious . I had , however , struck new balls at different periods of innings and was not afraid of that . " He also liked the idea of batting ahead of Bradman in the batting order : " Much better , I thought , to get in before him than to come later , like flat beer after champagne . " 
 Barnes was first @-@ choice as an opener with Arthur Morris throughout the Test series , although it was not until the Third Test that they had a first @-@ wicket partnership of any substance . Morris had broken into the team as an opener after an injury sidelined Bill Brown for the entire season . 
 The First Test at Brisbane was dominated by Australia , a pattern that was to be a feature of the series , although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory . Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match : during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm , he " got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept , staggered to the side of the dressing @-@ room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing @-@ room . It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter , crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass . Those English eyes certainly did stand out . " 
 Bradman had words with Barnes after this match about his new role as an opener . Barnes later wrote : " He asked me how I liked it . I said it suited me . ' You batted very well in this game , ' he said , ' but not quite as an opener . You were looking for runs all the time . I think what you want to watch as an opener is not getting out ... What is needed from my openers , and is most important , is patience and plenty of it . ' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do . " 
 Years later , Barnes wrote about the effect this had on his batting style . " There was one angle about this change of batting position that didn 't appeal to me . I am , by nature , a forcing batsman . I like to take the shine out of a bowler [ sic ] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets , or soaring over the fence ... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square @-@ cutting ... If I were to become an Australian Test opening batsman I would have to conform to standard . I would have to put up the shutters ... And so I came to the Second Test in Sydney ready to drape myself in the gloomy colors of a Test opening batsman . " 
 It was during the Second Test at Sydney in December 1946 , that Barnes made a lasting impression on the world game . Having opened the innings , he made his top Test score of 234 and helped to set a world @-@ record 405 run fifth wicket partnership with Don Bradman , a record that still stands today . On a rain @-@ affected pitch Arthur Morris was out at 1 / 24 and Ian Johnson came out as a nightwatchman He and Barnes angered the crowd by launching into a series of bad light appeals - up to 12 were counted - before the umpires gave way and play was ended with an hour to spare . This ensured that Australia would not have to play on a sticky wicket and allowed Bradman to rest his leg until play resumed on the Monday . After the series Barnes said on radio ; 
 We could have played on , but it was a Test match and we just had to win . I realised something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost . So I appealed after every second ball . I complained of the people moving about , the light , and , in fact , anything , in an effort to get the appeal upheld . Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch . I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me . 
 Barnes played carefully on the still suspect pitch the following day and late in the afternoon Bradman , lower in the order than usual due to a leg injury , joined Barnes with the score at 4 / 159 . Over six and a half hours later , Bradman was out for 234 . Barnes was dismissed just four balls later , also for 234 , having batted for over ten hours . In his autobiography , Barnes stated that the coincidence of scores was intended . " Lots of people have asked me whether I deliberately threw my wicket away at 234 . The answer is yes . " He confirmed to an interviewer many years later that " it wouldn 't be right for someone to make more runs than Sir Donald Bradman " . E.W. Swanton wrote that this " could well have been so for he was a man of quixotic mood and temperament " . However the England bowler , Alec Bedser wrote " It was when I was bowling to Sid at Sydney that I first discovered that I could move the ball to leg by use of my wrist and fingers ... I held the ball in the same manner as a leg @-@ break bowler with the fingers across the seam ... and on pitching I was surprised to see the ball go away like a leg @-@ break . It also surprised Sid Barnes " . This would make Barnes the first batsman to be dismissed by Bedser 's " Special Ball " which would claim Bradman for a duck in the Fourth Test at Adelaide . 
 Barnes injured his hand during fielding practice before the Third Test , and although he went on to play in that game ( scoring 45 and 32 ) , he opted out of batting in a state game – according to his autobiography , this cost him the New South Wales captaincy – and he missed the fourth Test . He returned for the final Test and top @-@ scored with 71 in Australia 's first innings , adding 30 in the second . 
 Barnes went to England in 1947 . In his autobiography , he claimed that he went as a representative for a wine and spirits company , although after the initial mention of that there is no further word and he appears also to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply because of rationing in England . Once in England , he was approached by Burnley to play as a professional in Lancashire League cricket , which he did for a while before finding it " too much of a drag " and resigning . 
 Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947 – 48 season , keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England . He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket , but at the same time suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams to fall back on should he not be picked . There was also concern that , with his wife now living in Scotland , he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers . In fact , lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes 's continued Test career . Arriving back with several state games having already been played , he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against the Indian tourists , Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris . 
 The match between Victoria and New South Wales was Barnes 's chance to redeem himself . Wisden reported it thus : 
 Barnes needed a score to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the Test Selectors and he spent all Saturday over 131 runs while 20 @,@ 000 impatient spectators barracked loudly . His dismissal on the third day evoked cheers all round the ground . 
 He followed that century ( 158 in total ) with a similarly plodding 80 not out in the second innings , and was picked for the third Test , with Brown dropped after a series of low scores in the first two Tests . Barnes made only 12 and 15 , jeopardising his place , but what Wisden termed " another of his dour , determined but faultless innings for top score " in the New South Wales game against South Australia ensured a second chance . In the fourth Test at Adelaide he made 112 and put on 236 with Bradman for the second wicket . With 33 in the final match of the series , his place on the 1948 tour was secure , though he had to give assurances about the amount of contact he would have with his wife , still living in Scotland , before he was confirmed . 
 = = = The Invincibles tour = = = 
 The 1948 Australia team that toured England has become known as The Invincibles , because they did not lose a single game . Following their performances during the Australian season , Barnes and Morris were favoured as Australia 's first @-@ choice opening pair , while Brown batted out of position in the middle order in the first two Tests . 
 Before the second Test at Lord 's , Barnes wagered £ 8 at 15 / 1 on himself to score a century . He made a duck in the first innings but ensured success in the second , making 141 . 
 Barnes and Morris shared century opening partnerships at Lord 's and The Oval , where their 117 run stand dwarfed the 52 all out made by the entire England team . In addition to his century at Lord 's , Barnes made three other scores over 60 in the series . 
 When fielding , Barnes stationed himself as close to the bat as possible at either forward short @-@ leg or point . The report of the tour in the 1949 edition of Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack , stated that Barnes 's fielding was as important a factor as his batting in The Invincibles ' success : 
 Probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on the bowler running up , but equally important was the fact that the knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction . The Barnes demeanour in the field illustrated the general purposefulness of the Australians . 
 However , he received criticism for this approach and it resulted in him missing the fourth Test at Leeds through injury . In England 's first innings of the third Test , he was hit in the ribs by a full @-@ blooded pull shot from Dick Pollard from the bowling of Ian Johnson , and had to be carried from the pitch by four policemen . The following day , he collapsed while practising in the nets , and when he went in to bat at number six , he collapsed again and had to retire hurt . After this , he was taken to hospital where he spent 10 days before rejoining the tour for the Derbyshire match that followed the fourth Test . 
 Barnes thus played in four of the five Tests , missing the fourth Test through injury . He scored 329 runs , averaging 82 @.@ 25 . During the first @-@ class tour matches , Barnes 's performance was less spectacular . In all first @-@ class matches on the tour , he amassed 1354 runs , averaging 56 @.@ 41 . Barnes made 176 in 255 minutes against Surrey early in the tour , but , apart from his Test hundred , his only other century came in the final tour match , when the final 50 runs of his 151 against the H. D. G. Leveson @-@ Gower XI at the Scarborough cricket festival came in just 25 minutes . 
 = = Later playing career = = 
 An important concern for Barnes , when returning from the United Kingdom to Australia , was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour . This included good quality English cloth , in very short supply in Australia at this time . Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him , Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train . The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit , conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee . 
 Barnes played in Bradman 's testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948 , but otherwise made himself unavailable for first @-@ class cricket , preferring to pursue business interests . He wrote a regular column for Sydney 's The Daily Telegraph , prosaically titled " Like It or Lump It " , in which he often criticised the administration of the game and the amounts paid to Australia 's leading cricketers . Barnes was one of a number of cricket writers of the immediate post @-@ war era who adopted a confrontational tabloid style of journalism , in contrast to the more sedate reporting of the 1930s . 
 = = = Libel case = = = 
 At the beginning of the 1951 – 52 season , Barnes had a change of heart and returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to play Test cricket again . He approached Aubrey Oxlade , the chairman of Australian cricket 's Board of Control , to ask if there was any impediment to his return to the Australian team . Oxlade told Barnes that he would be judged solely on his batting performances . 
 During his absence from the Test team , the Australian selectors had been unsuccessful in their attempts to find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting . Barnes started the season solidly and , in the last match before the team for the third Test against the West Indies was chosen , he hit 107 against Victoria . The selectors duly picked him for the match , then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification . The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player . Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes 's omission , the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement . When the team was not announced at the scheduled time , journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks , missing all of the remaining Tests . Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds . These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player 's pass ; insulting the Royal Family ; theft from team @-@ mates ; drunkenness ; and stealing a car . 
 The Board of Control had granted themselves the power to exclude a player from the national team " on grounds other than cricket ability " following the poor behaviour of some members of the 1912 team that toured England . They had a secret dossier , compiled during the season , documenting Barnes 's behaviour and they doctored the minutes of the meeting at which they discussed his selection . Publicly , the Board remained silent on their policy and how it related to Barnes . On the field , Barnes responded with an innings of 128 in three hours against Queensland ; off the field , he sought answers from the administrators , but was frustrated by their evasiveness . His form tapered off during the closing stages of the season and he finished with 433 first @-@ class runs at an average of 39 @.@ 36 . 
 Just as the furore appeared to have died down , in April 1952 Sydney 's Daily Mirror published a letter from a reader , Jacob Raith . Responding to a letter in support of Barnes , Raith sided with the Board and suggested that his character was to blame for the omission . Acting on legal advice , Barnes sued Raith for libel and engaged Sydney 's leading barrister , Jack Shand KC , as counsel . 
 The case began in Sydney 's District Court on 21 August 1952 . Shand 's examination of the various Board members appearing for the defendant revealed the Board 's maladministration , pettiness and its acceptance of rumour as fact . No firm reason was put forward for the omission of Barnes and a division within the Board was evident when several of its members spoke highly of him . As Barnes began his testimony on the second day of proceedings , Raith 's counsel announced settlement of the case and commented to the court , " ... seldom in the history of libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly " . Barnes was vindicated with a full public apology . 
 Although the court case portrayed " an awful image of the chaos and bigotry under which Australian cricket was administered " , it did little to alter the Board 's culture . The next major court case involving Australian cricket , the World Series Cricket challenges of 1977 – 78 demonstrated that the Board was still run as a " closed shop " , over 25 years later . In an analysis of the Barnes libel case , Gideon Haigh wrote , " ... far from becoming a watershed in player @-@ administrator relations , it may even have discouraged players contemplating defiance of the Board but lacking the wherewithal to retain a hotshot criminal barrister . " 
 = = = Twelfth man incident = = = 
 Resuming for New South Wales in 1952 – 53 , Barnes scored 152 against Victoria in the last match before the beginning of the Test series against South Africa . Nevertheless , the selectors overlooked him for the first Test and in the following state match , against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval , Barnes offered to act as twelfth man to provide an opportunity for a younger player , Ray <unk> . During a drinks break on the second day of the match , he appeared on the ground in a suit and tie , ( rather than ' whites ' ) carrying superfluous items such as cigars , iced towels , a mirror and comb , a radio and a clothes brush . The crowd initially responded well to the joke , but their mood soured when the interval extended beyond its scheduled time and Barnes received criticism for delaying the game . The South Australian team , captained by Australian selector Phil Ridings , officially complained to the New South Wales Cricket Association ( NSWCA ) , which asked Barnes to express regret over the incident . Despite the association 's support for Barnes during his problems of the previous season , he prevaricated . Eventually , the NSWCA forwarded a written apology on his behalf . 
 Barnes appeared just once more for New South Wales , against South Africa at New Year 1953 , then made himself unavailable for selection , conceding that " his card had been marked " . The Australian team toured England in 1953 and lost the Ashes after holding them for 19 years . Barnes wrote Eyes on the Ashes , a book about the tour that included trenchant criticism of the behaviour of the Australian team , which did not go down well with some of his former team @-@ mates . 
 = = Style and personality = = 
 Barnes gripped the bat very low on the handle and bent over so far in his stance that the knuckles of his right hand were level with his knees . He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover , which left him open @-@ chested when facing the bowler . A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary . His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler , putting him in position to play the hook , leg glance , sweep and his favourite square cut shot . 
 Journalist Ray Robinson called Barnes the Artful Dodger of cricket , alluding to both his batting style and his off @-@ field business dealings , and wrote that he , " ... would rather steal a run like a pickpocket than hit an honest four with a straightforward stroke . " Robinson summarised his safety @-@ first approach in going so far back as the bowler delivered : 
 Though this routine made his play air @-@ tight in one way , it simplified opposing captains ' field @-@ placing to curb his scoring , it left him with a back @-@ foot addict 's liability to go leg @-@ before @-@ wicket or be caught behind on either side , and it allowed his attackers to bowl their most awkward length ... he could have made more runs since the war as a stroke @-@ player , and won popular backing as a candidate for the title of world 's best batsman , instead of the austere distinction of looking the hardest Australian to get out . 
 David Frith wrote of Bill Brown 's memories of Barnes as a person , and his controversial fielding : 
 <unk> ' Barnes was also Bill 's room @-@ mate , and his affection for his late lamented pal , a lovable rogue , was obvious . He recalled the furore over Barnes 's provocative field positioning , extremely close at silly mid @-@ on , and how criticism of his foot being too close to the mown pitch prompted him to plonk his boot a couple of feet into the forbidden territory – and a couple of feet more when the English crowd roared at him . 
 He was a part @-@ time leg break bowler , taking 57 wickets in first @-@ class cricket at a useful average of 32 @.@ 21 . Barnes 's leg break spun very little , but he had a topspinner which hurried onto the batsman and yielded him many wickets . Barnes was also a substitute wicket @-@ keeper and a versatile fieldsman . During his career , he was noted for his disaffection for cricket administrators and umpires . On the 1948 tour of England , after an Australian appeal was turned down by umpire Alec Skelding , he grabbed a stray dog and presented it to Skelding , stating : " Now all you want is a white stick " . A complex character , Barnes , " ... rarely forgave a slight or forgot a good turn . Stocky , with blue eyes and powerful wrists , he had a passion for physical fitness , and was an enthusiastic big @-@ game fisherman and golfer " . 
 = = Life outside cricket = = 
 Barnes married a schoolteacher , Alison Margaret Edward on 11 June 1942 . Alison was the daughter of Kenneth Edward , a Scottish Professor of Theology at the University of Sydney . The couple met at a country dance , when Barnes , on his way back from an exhibition match in Katoomba , was bet the price of the meal that he could not get the young girl to dance with him . Within twelve months the pair were married . 
 Outside of cricket , Barnes followed his mother into property development ( see above ) and at various times entered into partnerships with Keith Miller and Norman Von Nida . His suspicious nature , which grew as time passed , saw these partnerships and developments end in arguments and recriminations . While Barnes was not a millionaire , he was a successful and organised businessman . 
 As a writer , Barnes had no claims to literary talent ; his copy was ghost @-@ written , in all likelihood by his friend Jack Tier and later by former rugby league player Peter Peters . His writing was of a provocative tone ; his column in the Daily Express during the 1953 tour was called " The Aussie They Couldn 't Gag " . His forthright opinions certainly cost him friends and hardened the opinions of others about him . At the end of the 1953 tour , he published Eyes on the Ashes , and his autobiography , It Isn 't Cricket . He also wrote The Ashes Ablaze in 1955 , and turned to full @-@ time writing , mostly for Sydney 's The Daily Telegraph . His columns were perceived as being deliberately controversial , and , as time went by , increasingly regarded as carping . 
 In later life , Barnes suffered from depressive illness . He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated with a combination of medication , mainly diazepam , and electroconvulsive therapy . He spent much of his last years in and out of clinics seeking treatment for his condition . In 1973 , Barnes died at his home in Collaroy , one of Sydney 's northern beach suburbs , from barbiturate and bromide poisoning . Although the medications were certainly self @-@ administered , the coroner could not " determine intent " . He was survived by his wife and three children . He was cremated at Northern Suburbs Crematorium , Sydney . 
 = = Statistical analysis = = 
 Only six players with ten or more completed innings have achieved an end of career average in excess of 60 . Barnes 's 63 @.@ 05 in 19 innings ranks him as number three in the history of Test cricket , behind Sir Donald Bradman ( 99 @.@ 94 , 80 innings ) and Stewie Dempster ( 65 @.@ 72 , 15 innings ) . 
 Barnes 's short career was dominated by his monumental double hundred , but he was a consistent performer , as the chart ( left ) reveals . Age did not seem to diminish his abilities ; in his last eight Test innings , aged 31 – 32 , he passed 50 five times and scored two of his three Test hundreds . 
 Comparing players from Test cricket is an exercise usually flawed by the different conditions , rules of the day and oppositions faced . However , a useful comparison can be made between Barnes and Bradman because they were contemporaries in the same team . Bradman is generally acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time , fully a third better ( statistically ) than the next best man in history ( see completed career averages chart , right ) . Barnes and Bradman played together in three series . In those series , Barnes 's averages bear comparison to Bradman 's , particularly in the more <unk> Ashes series : 
 Another way of viewing a player 's performance without distortion is by using the world rankings , which have been applied retrospectively to assess the careers of past players . However , the ratings employ a measure to " damp down the oscillation of points of new players " . Because Barnes played only 19 Test innings , his performances are weighted to just under 85 % of their full value . Consequently , even in his own day , he is rated as no better than seventh in the world , at his peak .

 = 2006 ACC Championship Game = 
 The 2006 Dr Pepper ACC Championship Game featured the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and the Wake Forest Demon Deacons in a regular @-@ season American football game to determine the champion of the Atlantic Coast Conference . Wake Forest defeated Georgia Tech by a 9 – 6 score to win its first ACC football championship since 1970 and its second in school history . The game was held at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium ( now known as EverBank Field ) in Jacksonville , Florida and was the concluding game of the regular season for each team . 
 Neither team was highly regarded at the beginning of the 2006 season , but each team outperformed expectations to earn the right to play in the conference championship game , which was the second in the conference 's history . Wake Forest , the Atlantic Division representative , earned a 10 – 2 record behind redshirt freshman quarterback Riley Skinner , who won the ACC 's rookie of the year award . Wake defeated tough ACC opponents Florida State and 16th @-@ ranked Boston College to win the Atlantic Division . Georgia Tech , led by junior All @-@ America wide receiver Calvin Johnson , defeated 11th @-@ ranked Virginia Tech and North Carolina en route to winning the Coastal Division and a spot in the championship game . 
 Low attendance and poor weather marred the contest , which kicked off amid rain and fog . Defense dominated from the beginning , as Georgia Tech took a 3 – 0 lead in the first quarter . Wake Forest evened the score before halftime , however , and the two teams headed into the second half tied at 3 – 3 . After a scoreless third quarter , Georgia Tech took a 6 – 3 lead early in the fourth quarter . After Tech quarterback Reggie Ball threw a critical interception , Wake Forest was able to tie the game , then take a 9 – 6 lead . With time running out , Wake 's defense denied Georgia Tech a game @-@ winning score , and Wake Forest clinched the win . 
 All the scoring in the game came via five field goals , and Wake Forest 's kicker , Sam Swank , was named the game 's most valuable player . By virtue of its victory , Wake Forest earned its first ACC football championship since 1970 and was awarded a bid to the 2007 Orange Bowl . Georgia Tech 's loss and second @-@ place ACC finish earned it a position in the 2007 Gator Bowl . Following the conclusion of each team 's bowl game , numerous players from both teams were selected in the 2007 NFL Draft .

 The ACC Championship Game matches the winner of the Coastal and Atlantic Divisions of the Atlantic Coast Conference . A conference championship game was added in 2005 , as a result of the league 's expansion the previous year , adding former Big East members Miami , Virginia Tech , and Boston College . With the addition of Boston College , the ACC consisted of 12 teams , allowing it to hold a conference championship game under NCAA rules . 
 Florida State defeated Virginia Tech , 27 – 22 in the first ACC Championship game . Following the 2005 game , the ACC requested that ABC schedule the 2006 contest for the afternoon in order to maximize television ratings . Heading into the 2006 college football season , Florida State and Miami were picked in the annual ACC pre @-@ season media poll as favorites to appear in the 2006 ACC Championship Game . Georgia Tech received the third @-@ most votes on the Coastal Division side of the poll , while Wake Forest was picked to finish last in the Atlantic Division .

 Georgia Tech 's 2006 season began with a tough game against No. 2 Notre Dame . Though the Yellow Jackets lost 14 @-@ 10 , they took an early 10 @-@ 0 lead over heavily favored Notre Dame until the Fighting Irish scored 14 unanswered points to win the game . Tech bounced back from the narrow loss by winning five straight games , including a 38 @-@ 27 victory in Blacksburg , Virginia against the No. 11 Virginia Tech Hokies , who would later go on to finish second in the division . 
 Heading into the seventh game of the season , Georgia Tech was 5 @-@ 1 and had an undefeated 3 @-@ 0 record in conference play . At No. 12 Clemson , however , Tech suffered its first conference loss and largest loss of the season , losing 31 @-@ 7 . Tech wide receiver Calvin Johnson failed to record a reception for the first time in his career during the loss . Tech followed the loss by winning its next four games . Following the third win , a 7 @-@ 0 shutout of North Carolina , Tech clinched the Coastal Division championship and a bid to the ACC Championship Game . 
 After clinching a spot in the championship game , Tech defeated ACC opponent Duke , then prepared for a game against traditional rival Georgia before heading to Jacksonville for the ACC championship . In the game against Georgia , the No. 16 Yellow Jackets were upset by the unranked Bulldogs , who intercepted Tech quarterback Reggie Ball twice and held him to just 42 passing yards in the game . Georgia 's victory marked the sixth consecutive victory in the rivalry and sent Tech into the ACC Championship Game on a down note .

 Wake Forest began the 2006 season on September 2 with a home game against Big East conference opponent Syracuse . Wake defeated Syracuse 20 – 10 , but starting quarterback Benjamin Mauk suffered a season @-@ ending injury when he fractured his arm , dislocated his shoulder , and suffered a torn labrum . Backup quarterback Riley Skinner replaced Mauk in the game , and would serve as Wake 's starting quarterback for the remainder of the season . 
 The Deacons struggled in their second game , beating ACC rival Duke 14 @-@ 13 by blocking a Duke field goal on the final play of the game . Following the close call against Duke , however , Wake Forest went on to win its next three games . A 34 @-@ 14 win over Football Championship Subdivision Liberty University gave Wake its first 5 @-@ 0 start since 1987 . 
 In its sixth game of the season , Wake Forest suffered its first loss . Against the No. 15 Clemson Tigers , Wake gave up 24 points in the fourth quarter to give Clemson a 27 @-@ 17 victory . The Demon Deacons recovered quickly from the loss and proceeded to begin another winning streak , this time against ACC opponents . Over the next four weeks , Wake defeated North Carolina State , North Carolina , No. 16 Boston College , and Florida State . The 30 @-@ 0 win over Florida State marked several milestones for the Deacons . The win marked the first time in school history that the Deacons had earned nine wins in a single season . In addition , Wake Forest recorded its first win against Florida State in Tallahassee since 1959 and became the first team to shut out a Bobby Bowden @-@ coached Florida State team in Doak Campbell Stadium . The game continues to be celebrated in Tallahassee , as it marked the end of the Jeff Bowden era . 
 In its next game , however , the Demon Deacons fell at home to the No. 19 Virginia Tech Hokies , 27 @-@ 6 . The Hokies would later go on to finish second in the Coastal Division and earn a bid to the 2007 Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl . Wake Forest recovered from its second loss of the season to earn a 38 @-@ 24 victory against Maryland — its first since 1998 — clinching the Atlantic Division championship and earning a bid to the ACC Championship Game . Wake became the first team in ACC history to go 6 @-@ 0 in ACC road games , and extended the school record for wins in a season to 10 .

 Georgia Tech wide receiver Calvin Johnson , who was voted the preseason ACC Player of the Year , was expected to do well in the ACC Championship Game . Johnson recorded 59 receptions for 889 yards and 13 touchdowns heading into the championship game . On November 29 , Johnson was named the ACC Player of the Year ( POY ) , fulfilling the expectations set when he earned preseason player of the year honors . On the day after Johnson earned ACC POY honors , he was named to the Rivals.com All @-@ America team , an annual selection of the best players at each position in the United States . Johnson was the first Tech player in over a decade to be selected as an All @-@ American in two consecutive seasons . 
 Tech quarterback Reggie Ball was not nearly as acclaimed . Despite leading the ACC with 20 touchdown passes and being named an All @-@ ACC honorable mention , there were doubts about Ball 's effectiveness . Since starting at quarterback in his freshman year , Ball went 0 @-@ 4 against Tech rival Georgia , and was excoriated for his inconsistency . After suffering a game @-@ losing fumble against the Bulldogs , commentators questioned how well Ball would recover from the setback before the ACC Championship Game . 
 Supporting Ball and Johnson were a corps of capable receivers including James Johnson and Greg Smith . James Johnson was Tech 's second @-@ leading receiver behind Calvin Johnson , and recorded over 500 receiving yards heading into the ACC championship . During Tech 's game against Virginia Tech , James caught a 49 @-@ yard touchdown pass for the game 's first points . Smith was Tech 's fifth @-@ leading receiver in 2006 , but had several key plays ( including two touchdown receptions ) in Georgia Tech 's game against the Duke Blue Devils . 
 On the ground , the Georgia Tech rushing attack was led by Tashard Choice . Choice was the leading rusher in the ACC , averaging over 100 yards per game . Against North Carolina State , Choice recorded 164 rushing yards on 34 carries , earning what was then a single @-@ game career high in rushing yards . In the days before the ACC championship , Choice was named to the second @-@ team All @-@ ACC team , and was considered to be a threat on offense against Wake Forest .

 Wake Forest , which had begun the season with Benjamin Mauk as its starting quarterback , ended the season with redshirt freshman Riley Skinner filling the position . Despite having almost no experience starting at quarterback before the season , Skinner was named the ACC 's rookie of the year . Skinner led the ACC in completion percentage , passing efficiency , and interception rate . In addition , Skinner set 10 new single @-@ season passing records at Wake Forest during the 2006 season . In the days before the ACC Championship Game , Skinner was named to the second @-@ team All @-@ ACC team , joining eight other teammates selected to one of the two All @-@ ACC teams . 
 Two of the other Deacons selected for All @-@ ACC honors were senior tackle Steve <unk> and junior center Steve Justice , both of whom were key components of the Wake Forest offensive line . <unk> had been considered for the Lombardi Award and Outland Trophy and won first @-@ team Associated Press All @-@ America honors after the championship game . Center Steve Justice started all 14 games during Wake Forest 's 2006 season , and participated in 98 percent of the Deacons ' offensive plays . 
 Wake Forest also boasted one of the nation 's best punters and <unk> , Sam Swank . Swank was one of the team 's nine 2006 All @-@ ACC selections , and performed extremely well during the season . Swank led the Deacons in points scored , and was successful on five of seven kicks from beyond 50 yards during the season . Swank was a finalist for the Ray Guy Award and Lou Groza Award , which go to the nation 's best punter and placekicker , respectively .

In the days leading up to the championship game , Wheeler was named to the Rivals.com All @-@ America team . In addition , Wheeler was a second @-@ team All @-@ ACC selection and a two @-@ time ACC Defensive Player of the Week . 
 On the defensive line , Georgia Tech featured defensive tackle Joe Anoa 'i and defensive end Adamm Oliver .

 The 2006 ACC Championship Game kicked off at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville , Florida on December 2 , 2006 . The game was broadcast on ABC , and earned a 4 @.@ 0 television rating . This figure was down slightly from the previous year 's game , which earned a 5 @.@ 1 rating . Brad Nessler , Bob Griese , Paul Maguire , and Bonnie Bernstein were selected to announce the game . 
 At kickoff , a light breeze was blowing from the northeast at 5 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) , the air temperature was 59 ° F ( 15 ° C ) , and the weather was foggy with a light rain . Rain had been falling for several hours , turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game . 62 @,@ 850 tickets were sold for the game , and that number was given as the official attendance . Real attendance estimates range from 40 @,@ 000 @-@ 50 @,@ 000 , due to the poor weather and the fact that the stadium was half @-@ empty through much of the game . 
 During the pre @-@ game coin toss , a member of the Wounded Warrior Project , which rehabilitates wounded American war veterans , threw the ceremonial coin . Georgia Tech won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball to begin the game . After Georgia Tech made its selection , Wake Forest elected to defend the north end zone to begin the game , forcing Georgia Tech 's kickers to kick into the wind during the first and fourth quarters . 
 = = = First quarter = = = 
 Wake Forest kicked off to begin the game , and Georgia Tech returned the kick to its own 24 @-@ yard line . On the first play of the game , Tech running back Tashard Choice attempted a rush , but was stopped for a loss of one yard . The play set the tone for the rest of the game , which would be a hard @-@ fought , low @-@ scoring defensive struggle . After the loss , Choice broke free on the second play of the game for a 24 @-@ yard run and a first down . On the next two plays , the Georgia Tech offense used their passing attack as quarterback Reggie Ball completed two passes , driving the Yellowjackets into Wake Forest territory . Subsequent plays allowed Tech to penetrate the Wake Forest red zone , but there , the Demon Deacons ' defense stiffened . Despite having a first down inside the Wake Forest 10 @-@ yard line , Georgia Tech did not cross the goal line . Denied a touchdown , Georgia Tech was forced to settle for a field goal attempt from kicker Travis Bell . Bell 's kick was good , and with 9 : 59 remaining in the first quarter , Georgia Tech took a 3 – 0 lead . 
 Following Georgia Tech 's post @-@ score kickoff , Wake Forest received the ball , but failed to gain a first down . The Deacons ' offense went three and out and was forced to punt . On Tech 's next possession , they too had difficulty moving the football on offense . Though they picked up a first down off of a penalty on Wake Forest , they were unable to gain a first down by their own devices and were forced to punt the ball away . 
 The two teams traded possessions once more , and as the first quarter came to an end , Georgia Tech was in possession of the ball but was preparing to punt it away after yet another failure to pick up a first down . 
 = = = Second quarter = = = 
 Following the Georgia Tech punt , Wake Forest received the ball to begin the second quarter . Wake Forest , after a three and out , again punted the ball and Georgia Tech took over on offense . On their first full possession of the second quarter , Tech seemed to have more success moving the ball . Quarterback Reggie Ball picked up a first down running the ball , then completed a 22 @-@ yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson , driving the Yellow Jackets inside Wake Forest territory . Once there , however , Wake Forest 's defense stiffened . Ball was unable to complete two consecutive passes , and his third pass inside Wake Forest territory was intercepted . 
 Having regained the ball , Wake Forest answered Georgia Tech 's drive with one of their own . Several Wake running backs rushed with the ball , but it was Wake Forest quarterback Riley Skinner who advanced the ball the most . He completed a 24 @-@ yard pass to Willie Idlette , then an eight @-@ yard toss to Nate Morton . Inside Tech territory , Wake 's offense stumbled . Skinner was sacked by a Tech defender , and kicker Sam Swank was sent into the game to attempt a 45 @-@ yard field goal . Swank 's kick was no good , and with 7 : 26 remaining in the second quarter , Georgia Tech still had a 3 – 0 lead . 
 Taking over after the missed field goal , Georgia Tech was unable to gain a first down . After the Yellow Jackets punted the ball away , Wake Forest continued to have the increased offensive success they had shown in their previous drive . This time , it was running back Kenneth Moore who picked up the majority of the Deacons ' yardage , as he carried the ball eight times during the drive . Toward the end of the drive , Wake Forest was assisted by a 10 @-@ yard penalty against the Yellow Jackets , which drove them inside Georgia Tech 's red zone . There , however , Tech 's defense stiffened . Despite having a first down at Tech 's 10 @-@ yard line , Wake was unable to score a touchdown . Kicker Sam Swank again came into the game to attempt a field goal , and connected on a 19 @-@ yard field goal . The kick tied the score at 3 – 3 with just 58 seconds remaining in the first half . 
 With time in the half virtually exhausted , Georgia Tech elected to run down the clock and take the game into halftime tied , 3 – 3 . 
 = = = Third quarter = = = 
 Because Georgia Tech received the ball to begin the game , Wake Forest received the ball to begin the second half . As in the first half , however , both teams ' offenses were stifled by each team 's defense . On its first possession of the second half , Wake Forest reached the Georgia Tech 48 @-@ yard line before being forced to punt . 
 Georgia Tech 's first possession of the half was slightly more successful than Wake Forest 's , as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons ' 30 @-@ yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball . Again , however , the Tech defense stumbled . Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone , Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball . Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down , Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line . The play was typical of the third quarter , which saw both teams fail to score . 
 Both Wake Forest and Georgia Tech mounted several drives into the other 's territory , but were either stopped outside field goal range or attempted to convert a fourth down rather than kick the ball . As the quarter came to an end , the score remained tied 3 – 3 , with neither team having scored a touchdown . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 At the beginning of the fourth quarter , Georgia Tech was in possession of the ball , deep inside Wake Forest territory . Shortly after the quarter began , Tech failed to gain a needed first down in order to continue its drive . Instead of attempting to convert the fourth down — Tech had attempted and failed on two fourth @-@ down conversions in the third quarter — Tech instead sent in kicker Travis Bell . Bell 's 34 @-@ yard attempt sailed through the goalposts , and with 12 : 53 remaining in the game , Georgia Tech took a 6 – 3 lead . 
 After Georgia Tech 's post @-@ score kickoff , Wake Forest continued to struggle on offense . Quarterback Riley Skinner was sacked , threw an 18 @-@ yard completion , then three incomplete passes . Wake was forced to punt the ball away again , allowing the Yellow Jackets the possibility of expanding their lead . On Tech 's first play after the punt , however , Reggie Ball 's pass was intercepted , allowing Wake Forest another chance on offense . The play turned the momentum of the game in favor of Wake Forest , who proceeded to move the ball with slightly more effectiveness . During the Wake Forest drive , Skinner completed a 39 @-@ yard pass to John <unk> , who drove the Deacons inside Georgia Tech territory , where the drive continued . Though Wake Forest was forced to settle for a 33 @-@ yard field goal from kicker Sam Swank , the score tied the game at 6 – 6 with 7 : 59 remaining in the game . 
 Wake 's post @-@ score kickoff was downed in the end zone for a touchback . With time running down , Georgia Tech had a chance for a game @-@ winning score if it could sustain a drive into Wake Forest territory from its own 20 @-@ yard line . The drive began with a promising 14 @-@ yard completion to Calvin Johnson , but after Reggie Ball threw three incomplete passes , Georgia Tech was forced to punt the ball back to Wake Forest . The Deacons , after getting the ball at their own 20 @-@ yard line , began a drive of their own . Riley Skinner completed his first four passes of the drive , including a long 45 @-@ yard strike to Willie Idlette for the longest play of the game . With a first down inside the Georgia Tech red zone , the Deacons seemed to be in perfect position for a potentially game @-@ winning touchdown . But as had every other drive previous , Wake Forest 's offense failed to cross the goal line . Sam Swank kicked a 22 @-@ yard field goal to give the Deacons a 9 – 6 lead , but Georgia Tech still had time for one final drive . 
 After receiving the Wake Forest kickoff , however , Georgia Tech 's hopes were quickly deflated by three plays that resulted in negative yardage or no gain . Georgia Tech was forced into its final punt of the game , and Wake Forest received the ball and ran out the remaining time on the clock . Wake Forest won the 2006 ACC Championship Game by a 9 – 6 score . 
 = = Statistical summary = = 
 Thanks to his performance in the game , Wake Forest placekicker Sam Swank was named the game 's most valuable player . Swank was successful on three of his four field goal kicks during the game , kicking 19 , 33 , and 22 @-@ yard field goals while missing on a 45 @-@ yard attempt in the second quarter . The Demon Deacons ' nine points — all of which were scored by Swank — were the least ever scored by the winning team in a Division I @-@ A conference championship game . 
 Wake Forest quarterback Riley Skinner finished the game having completed 14 of his 25 pass attempts . He passed for 201 yards , one @-@ fifth of which came on a single play during Wake Forest 's final drive of the game . On the opposite side of the ball , Georgia Tech quarterback Reggie Ball completed just nine of his 29 passes . Two of Ball 's passes were intercepted by Wake Forest defenders , and Ball accounted for just 129 passing yards . 
 The majority of Georgia Tech 's offense came on the ground from running back Tashard Choice and from quarterback scrambles by Ball . Choice ran the ball 21 times , netting 100 yards . Ball was Tech 's second @-@ leading rusher , and picked up 46 yards on 15 different rushes . Eight different players carried the ball for Wake Forest , with Kenneth Moore and Willie Idlette picking up the majority of the yardage . Moore finished the game with 16 carries for 38 yards , while Idlette earned 35 yards on six different attempts . Half of Idlette 's yards came on one 19 @-@ yard carry , and he also earned 73 receiving yards during the game to lead all Wake receivers . 
 On defense , Jon Abbate led all Wake Forest defenders with 15 total tackles . Abbate also earned two tackles for loss and a quarterback sack of Reggie Ball . Riley Swanson and Aaron Curry each caught an interception for Wake . Kenny Scott led the Georgia Tech defense statistically , earning eight total tackles , two tackles for loss , and one quarterback sack . Adamm Oliver finished with seven total tackles and one and a half tackles for loss .

 With the victory , Wake Forest finished the regular season with an 11 – 2 record , breaking its previous team record for wins in a season . The 2006 ACC Championship was Wake 's second championship in history , the first having come in 1970 . Following the game , the Deacons ' head coach , Jim Grobe , earned multiple national coach of the year honors for taking Wake to its first ACC championship in 36 years and taking the program from the worst in the ACC to the best in just one season . 
 Following the game , Wake Forest earned an automatic bid to the 2007 Orange Bowl as a reward for its status as ACC champion . Wake Forest faced the Louisville Cardinals in Pro Player Stadium , now known as Sun Life Stadium , in Miami Gardens , Florida . 
 Georgia Tech 's took <unk> a 9 – 3 record . Tech was selected as a participant in the 2007 Gator Bowl as a reward for its second @-@ place ACC finish . 
 Tech 's selection to the Gator Bowl was a controversial one . Because both the Gator Bowl and ACC Championship game were held in Jacksonville , Georgia Tech would be forced to play two games in Jacksonville in four weeks . The team , league , and bowl officials were concerned that fact would hurt attendance . 
 = Typhoon Noul ( 2015 ) = 
 Typhoon Noul , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Dodong , was a relatively small but powerful tropical cyclone that affected several areas but caused minor damage . The sixth named storm and third typhoon of the annual typhoon season , Noul formed as a tropical depression over the eastern Caroline Islands on May 2 , 2015 . It moved generally to the west and west @-@ northwest , gradually intensifying into a tropical storm and later typhoon . On May 9 , Noul began rapid deepening as it developed a well @-@ defined eye . Early the next day , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) , while the American @-@ based Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated peak 1 minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Noul struck northeastern Luzon in the Philippines at that intensity and greatly weakened . After passing east of Taiwan , the typhoon accelerated to the northeast and weakened due to unfavorable conditions . On May 12 , Noul became extratropical south of Japan , and the remnants continued to the northeast for several days , dissipating on May 16 . 
 The typhoon first affected Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia , bringing 296 mm ( 11 @.@ 65 in ) of rainfall and causing about US $ 100 @,@ 000 in damage . Noul forced 3 @,@ 803 people to evacuate in the Philippines and stranded thousands others due to travel cancellations . Two people died while preparing for the storm . Its effects were limited to two provinces , amounting to ₱ 16 @.@ 3 million ( US $ 362 @,@ 000 ) in damage . Later , heavy rainfall in Taiwan helped ease water restrictions . The storm caused heavy crop damage in the Miyako District of Okinawa , totaling ¥ 2 @.@ 8 billion ( US $ 23 @.@ 2 million ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Noul were related to a strong westerly wind burst that also led to the formation of later Typhoon Dolphin . By April 30 , 2015 , an area of convection , or thunderstorms , persisted and pulsed about 230 km ( 145 mi ) west @-@ southwest of Chuuk State within the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) . The system had a broad circulation amid an environment favorable for tropical cyclogenesis , including low to moderate wind shear . The circulation slowly consolidated , developing improved outflow and increasingly organized convection . At 06 : 00 UTC on May 2 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) designated the system as a tropical depression about 850 km ( 525 mi ) west @-@ southwest of Chuuk . At 00 : 00 UTC the next day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified the system as Tropical Depression <unk> . 
 The nascent tropical cyclone moved northwestward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge . Aided by decreasing wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures , the convection organized into a central dense overcast . At 18 : 00 UTC on May 3 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Noul . The strengthening ridge turned the storm to the west toward the Philippines . On May 5 , an eye developed in the center of the storm while Noul was near Yap State , prompting the JTWC to upgrade the storm to typhoon status . At 18 : 00 UTC that day , the JMA upgraded Noul to a severe tropical storm , and later to typhoon status at 06 : 00 UTC on May 6 . The storm 's spiral rainbands became increasingly organized , although the eye initially remained cloud @-@ filled . Early on May 7 , Noul crossed <unk> E into the area of responsibility of PAGASA – the Philippines ' weather bureau – who assigned the local name Dodong . 
 Due to radial outflow , low vertical wind shear , and water temperatures above 30 ° C , Noul started rapid deepening on May 9 while approaching the Philippine island of Luzon , forming a sharply well @-@ defined 35 km ( 20 mi ) eye embedded in a deepening symmetric core ; therefore , the JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon late on the same day . At 00 : 00 UTC on May 10 , the JMA estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . At the same time , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute sustained winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . As the typhoon neared the northeast tip of Luzon , satellite imagery showed rapid deterioration of the storm 's core structure and warming of the cloud tops . According to PAGASA , at around 08 : 45 UTC on May 10 , Noul made landfall in the Philippines at <unk> Point in Santa Ana , Cagayan . However , the JMA and JTWC tracks do not show landfall , but instead show the center staying offshore . After its closest approach to Luzon , the storm 's structure continued to deteriorate , becoming elongated and less organized due to increasing wind shear and land interaction . By late on May 10 , the eye largely disappeared from satellite imagery as Noul turned northward over water , steered around the subtropical ridge . A large residual eye persisted in the center of the waning convection , although stronger wind shear increasingly disrupted the storm 's structure . An approaching trough steered Noul to the northeast , bringing it east of Taiwan on May 11 . By early on May 12 , the storm had become increasingly elongated as dry air became entrained in the center , with the structure resembling a " comma " -shape , according to the JTWC . The agency downgraded it to a tropical storm at 00 : 00 UTC that day as the storm accelerated through Amami Ōshima . Six hours later , the storm became extratropical off the southern coast of Japan . 
 The extratropical remnants of Noul continued to the northeast . Around 12 : 00 UTC on May 12 , the storm passed through the Kantō region of southeastern Japan . The center quickly moved back over water and passed just east of Hokkaido on May 13 . Noul slowed its forward motion while remaining south of the Kuril Islands and Russia 's Kamchatka Peninsula . At 06 : 00 UTC on May 16 , the remnants of Noul dissipated near the international date line , after being absorbed by another large extratropical storm .

 Ahead of the storm 's arrival , typhoon warnings were issued for Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) . In its formative stages , Noul caused minor damage to Fais Island and Ulithi Atoll . On the island of Yap , the typhoon produced gusts to 116 km / h ( 72 mph ) and 296 mm ( 11 @.@ 65 in ) of rainfall . Damage on the island was estimated at US $ 100 @,@ 000 . The storm delayed a supply ship to outlying islands of the state that were previously affected by Typhoon Maysak a month prior .

 Typhoon Noul , known as Typhoon Dodong within the country , entered the Philippine area of Responsibility on May 7 . In response to the storm , PAGASA raised warning signal 4 , the highest level , for northeastern Cagayan as well as the offshore Batanes and Babuyan Islands . Neighboring provinces had lower warning signals . A total of 3 @,@ 803 people evacuated their homes in Cagayan and Isabela to 27 storm shelters ; families returned home by late on May 10 after the storm moved ashore without causing much damage . Flights and ferry routes were canceled , stranding 10 @,@ 000 people . The Philippine Army deployed 18 soldiers to assist in storm preparations , utilizing boats and helicopters . Fishermen were advised not to go out to sea east of Luzon . People were also evacuated from the vicinity of Mount <unk> after rains from Noul threatened to cause lahars and mudslides from ash of a recent eruption . They were allowed to return after Noul recurved to the north and the threat did not materialize . Two people in Cagayan died due to electrocution while attempting to fix their roofs ahead of the storm . 
 Upon striking the Philippines , the typhoon produced high winds and heavy rainfall to Luzon . Noul knocked down trees and damaged houses , resulting in power outages to seven communities ; the power was restored within one day . The storm 's rains were beneficial to local farmers after an extended dry spell . In Santa Ana where the storm moved ashore , the storm caused minor damage to seven schools . Across Cagayan , the storm damaged ₱ 2 @.@ 7 million ( US $ 60 @,@ 000 ) worth of corn and rice crops , as well as minor damage to fisheries .

 In Taiwan , domestic flights from mainland Taiwan to the outlying Green Island and Orchid Island were canceled for May 10 . Also in the outlying islands , schools and offices were closed in anticipation of the storm , while boats sought shelter at harbors . Heavy rains from the storm 's outer bands and a frontal system brought much needed rain to areas of northern Taiwan suffering from a severe drought . A total of 93 mm ( 3 @.@ 7 in ) of rain fell at the Shihmen Dam , amounting to an increase of approximately 7 million tonnes of water in the reservoir , and bringing it to 30 @.@ 5 % capacity . Several major cities were able to lift water rationing as a result .

 The remnants of Noul , in conjunction with later Typhoon Dolphin , shifted the broader weather pattern to bring record warmth to Alaska , making the temperatures warmer than that of Washington , D.C .. 
 = Hermeneutic style = 
 The hermeneutic style is a style of Latin in the later Roman and early Medieval periods characterised by the extensive use of unusual and arcane words , especially derived from Greek . The style is first found in the work of Apuleius in the second century , and then in several late Roman writers . In the early medieval period , some leading Continental scholars were exponents , including Johannes Scotus Eriugena and Odo of Cluny . 
 In England , the seventh @-@ century bishop Aldhelm was the most influential hermeneutic writer ; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century , and when it revived in the tenth , the hermeneutic style became increasingly influential . Unlike in continental Europe , where it was used only by a minority of writers , in tenth @-@ century England it became nearly universal . It was the house style of the English Benedictine Reform , the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo @-@ Saxon England . The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest , and the twelfth @-@ century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic . Historians were equally dismissive until the late twentieth century , when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued that it should be taken seriously as an important aspect of late Anglo @-@ Saxon culture . 
 = = Definition = = 
 In 1953 , Alistair Campbell argued that there were two principal styles of Latin in Anglo @-@ Saxon England . One , which he called the classical , was exemplified by the writings of Bede ( c . 672 – 735 ) , while the English bishop Aldhelm ( c . 639 – 709 ) was the most influential author of the other school , which extensively used rare words , including Greek ones derived from " hermeneutic " glossaries . Andy Orchard contrasts the " limpid and direct prose style of Bede , with its basically biblical vocabulary and syntax " with the " highly elaborate and ornate style of Aldhelm , with a vocabulary and syntax ultimately derived from Latin verse " . Aldhelm was the most learned man in the first four centuries of Anglo @-@ Saxon Christianity , with a profound knowledge of Latin poetry ( unlike Bede ) . His style was highly influential in the two centuries after his death , and it was dominant in later Anglo @-@ Saxon England . Borrowing from Greek was not confined to hermeneutic writers of Latin . In a 2005 study , J. N. Adams , Michael Lapidge and Tobias Reinhardt observe that " the exhumation of ( poorly understood ) Greek words from Greek @-@ Latin glossaries for purposes of stylistic ornamentation was widespread throughout the Middle Ages . " 
 In the preface to his 1962 edition of Æthelweard 's Chronicon , Campbell referred to the " hermeneutic tradition " . In 1975 , Michael Lapidge developed Campbell 's distinction in an essay on the " hermeneutic style " . He stated that the term implies that the vocabulary is based mainly on the <unk> , a name for certain Greek @-@ Latin glossaries . He did not consider the term entirely satisfactory , and suggested that " <unk> " would be an alternative , but adopted " hermeneutic " because it had been used by other scholars . Jane Stevenson also expresses dissatisfaction with the term , and in the view of Rebecca Stephenson : " The word " hermeneutic " itself is misleading , since this style has nothing to do with the modern field of hermeneutics , nor does it feature words drawn from the <unk> , a set of Greek and Latin glossaries , from which its exotic vocabulary was once thought to derive . " However , both scholars reluctantly accept the term . The style was formerly called " <unk> " , but scholars now reject this term as wrongly suggesting that it is Irish , and think " <unk> " should be confined to the language of the very obscure <unk> <unk> . 
 Lapidge states : 
 By " hermeneutic " I understand a style whose most striking feature is the ostentatious parade of unusual , often very arcane and apparently learned vocabulary . In Latin literature of the medieval period , this vocabulary is of three general sorts : ( 1 ) archaisms , words which were not in use in classical Latin but were exhumed by medieval authors from the grammarians or from Terence and Plautus ; ( 2 ) neologisms or coinages ; and ( 3 ) loan words . 
 = = Early development = = 
 The hermeneutic style was possibly first seen in the Metamorphoses of Apuleius in the second century , and it is also found in works by late Latin writers such as Ammianus Marcellinus and Martianus Capella . In Britain and Ireland , the style is found in authors on the threshold of the medieval period including the British monk Gildas , the Irish missionary Columbanus and the Anglo @-@ Saxon bishop Aldhelm , and works such as the <unk> <unk> . The Anglo @-@ Saxons were the first people in Europe who had to learn Latin as a foreign language when they converted to Christianity , and in Lapidge 's view : " That they attained stylistic mastery in a medium alien to them is remarkable in itself " . 
 The influential ninth @-@ century Irish philosopher Johannes Scotus Eriugena had a thorough knowledge of Greek , and through his translations and use of unusual Greek words in poetry helped to raise the prestige of the hermeneutic style . The style became fashionable at Laon , where Johannes 's colleague and fellow Irishman , Martianus <unk> , lectured . Hincmar of Rheims rebuked his nephew , Hincmar of Laon : 
 But when there are sufficient Latin words which you could have put in those places where you have put <unk> and abstruse words and even Irish words and other <unk> ( <unk> et <unk> et <unk> <unk> et alia <unk> ) – as you saw fit – which are <unk> and corrupt , it would appear that you have inserted those words most unfortunately not out of humility but for the ostentation of those Greek words which you wished to use – which you yourself don 't understand – so that everyone who reads them may recognise that you wanted to vomit up words which you hadn 't choked down . 
 = = Continental Europe = = 
 The style is found in several centres on the Continent in the tenth century . In Italy , the leading proponents were Liutprand of Cremona , Eugenius <unk> and <unk> of Vercelli . In Germany , works which display it include the anonymous Gesta <unk> and the letters of <unk> of Tegernsee . French works which display the hermeneutic style include <unk> of Saint @-@ Quentin 's Gesta <unk> Ducum and the Libellus Sacerdotalis by Lios <unk> . 
 Two other French authors were particularly influential in England . The first two books of Abbo of Saint @-@ Germain 's Bella <unk> <unk> describe the siege of Paris by the Normans from 888 to 895 ; they received very little circulation . However , in order to make the work a trinity ( three @-@ volume work ) he added a book described by Lapidge as " a series of exhortations to the monastic life … written in a fiercely tangled and often inscrutable Latin whose vocabulary is nearly all glossary @-@ based " . This became a very popular textbook , especially in England . The other influential French author was Odo of Cluny , who was probably a mentor of Oda , Archbishop of Canterbury ( 941 – 958 ) , a driving force behind the English Benedictine Reform and a proponent of the hermeneutic style . Lapidge suggests that the style in northern France was particularly associated with centres of the Cluniac ( Benedictine ) reform , and the leading figures in the English reform , Oda , Dunstan , Æthelwold and Oswald , were all practitioners of the hermeneutic style and had strong connections with Continental Benedictine centres . Lapidge argues : 
 One might surmise that the hermeneutic style was cultivated energetically in England in an attempt to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated as anything produced on the Continent . The impetus for the cultivation of the style in tenth @-@ century England was therefore probably of Continental origin . 
 A late proponent of the style was the German <unk> of Echternach , abbot of Echternach between 1083 and 1110 , who was strongly influenced by Aldhelm . 
 = = England = = 
 On the Continent , some writers were exponents of the hermeneutic style ; in England in the later tenth century almost all were . The study of difficult texts had been a traditional part of Latin education in England since the days of Aldhelm , and he profoundly influenced later writers . In tenth @-@ century England , Aldhelm and Abbo were studied intensively , whereas hermeneutic works did not form an important part of the Continental curriculum . Aldhelm 's De Virginitate ( On Virginity ) was particularly influential , and in the 980s an English scholar requested permission from Archbishop Æthelgar to go to Winchester to study it , complaining that he had been starved of intellectual food . A passage in De Virginitate reads : 
 So , against the dread beast of pride and against these sevenfold brutes of poisonous vices , which strive cruelly to tear apart with their rabid teeth and virulent fangs all who are unarmed , despoiled of the cuirass of virginity and stripped of the shield of chastity , the virgins of Christ and the young champions of the church must fight with muscle and strength . Against , as it were , the ferocious legions of the barbarians , which in their troops never cease to batter the tortoise of the soldiers of Christ with the artillery of <unk> fraud , the struggle must go on manfully , fought with the darts of spiritual weaponry and the iron @-@ tipped spears of the virtues . Let us not , like timid soldiers who <unk> dread the shock of war and the call of the trumpeter , <unk> offer to the ravening foe the backs of our shoulders rather than the bosses of our shields ! 
 Anglo @-@ Latin suffered a severe decline in the ninth century , partly due to the Viking invasions , but it began to revive in the 890s under Alfred the Great , who revered Aldhelm . Asser 's Life of King Alfred has a hermeneutic flavour . Alfred was assisted by scholars he brought in from continental Europe . One of them was a German , John the Old Saxon , and in Lapidge 's view a poem he wrote praising the future King Æthelstan , and punning on the Old English meaning of Æthelstan as " noble stone " , marks an early sign of a revival of the hermeneutic style : 
 You , prince , are called by the name " sovereign stone " , 
 Look happily on this prophecy for your age : 
 You shall be the " noble rock " of Samuel the Seer , 
 [ Standing ] with mighty strength against devilish demons . 
 Often an abundant cornfield foretells a great harvest ; in 
 Peaceful days your stony mass is to be softened . 
 You are more abundantly endowed with the holy eminence of learning . 
 I pray you may seek , and the Glorious One may grant , the [ fulfilment implied in your ] noble name . 
 The revival of the hermeneutic style was assisted by foreign scholars at the court of King Æthelstan in the late 920s and 930s , some of them , such as Israel the Grammarian , practitioners of hermeneutic Latin . The style was first seen in tenth @-@ century England in charters drafted between 928 and 935 by an anonymous scribe of King Æthelstan called by scholars " Æthelstan A " , who was strongly influenced by Aldhelm and by Hiberno @-@ Latin works which may have been brought to England by Israel . According to Scott Thompson Smith , the charters of " Æthelstan A " : " are generally characterised by a rich <unk> style with aggressively literary proems and anathemas , ostentatious language and imagery throughout , decorative rhetorical figures , elaborate dating clauses and extensive witness lists . " The charters are first seen shortly after Æthelstan had become the first king of all England by his conquest of Viking @-@ ruled Northumbria in 927 , and in the view of Mechthild Gretsch the charters are the result of " the affection of a style associated with a glorious intellectual past in order to boost what was conceived as a glorious military and political achievement " . 
 David Woodman gives a translation of the start of a charter drafted by " Æthelstan A " , S 416 issued on 12 November 931 : 
 The lamentable and loudly detestable sins of this tottering age , surrounded by the dire <unk> of obscene and fearsome mortality , challenge and urge us , not carefree in a homeland where peace has been attained but , as it were , teetering over an abyss of fetid corruption , that we should flee those things not only by despising them together with their misfortunes with the whole effort of our mind but also by hating them just like the wearisome nausea of melancholy , striving towards that Gospel text , " Give and it will be given unto you " . 
 Only one short hermeneutic work by the mid @-@ century Archbishop of Canterbury , Oda , survives , but his influence can be seen in his protégé Frithegod of Canterbury 's <unk> Vitae <unk> , described by Lapidge as " the most difficult Anglo @-@ Latin text " , which " may dubiously be described as the ' masterpiece ' of Anglo @-@ Latin hermeneutic style " . Lapidge states that " the hermeneutic style was practised with considerable flair and enthusiasm at Canterbury " . Other centres of the style were also closely associated with leaders of the Benedictine reform : Ramsey Abbey , founded by Oswald , Bishop of Worcester , Glastonbury Abbey , where the future Archbishop of Canterbury , Dunstan , was abbot in the 940s and Winchester , where Æthelwold was bishop . There are different emphases in the various centres : a predilection for neologisms at Canterbury and for <unk> at Winchester , while the leading Ramsey scholar , Byrhtferth , favoured unusual polysyllabic adverbs . The most important document of the Benedictine Reform , the Regularis Concordia , drafted by Æthelwold , was written in hermeneutic style strongly influenced by Aldhelm . Discussing the ideology of the reform movement , Caroline Brett comments : " The use of hermeneutic Latin with its deliberately obscure neologisms and verbal borrowings must have sent potent signals of a learned <unk> caste , guardians of arcane yet powerful knowledge . " 
 Lapidge gives a translation of a poem by Dunstan : 
 Christ , you grant . 
 O omnipotent Father , may you deign to bring rewards to the donor – ( you ) who above the depths and realms of the heaven as well as the earth and at the same time the recesses of the sea – throughout all this world you rule the angelic citizens of such bounteous merit ; and may you grant to grow in me the seed of holy labour by which I may always be able to hymn appropriately your name . 
 O you , Son , who , concealed in your mother 's womb , you gather together peoples by your Father 's act – for I perchance am able to compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God , because , glorious one , the glittering stars show ( you ) to the world ; and I ask , after the close of my life , that you grant to me from the throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of the honour ( I have ) attained . 
 I beseech you , Holy Spirit of the Father and Son : for when the holy throng re @-@ echoes its songs , may I then with humble voice be able to ascend quickly as I leave the grave , bearing then the holy prayers of the saints who already have scorned this present world of dust with their learned outpourings , and may I fearlessly be able to pour out my glorious song to the triune ( God ) . 
 Virgin , whom the messenger salutes in angelic speech , you were born without stain : I ask that you implore him – who , born from the conception of celestial seed holds the mysterious command as <unk> deity – to forgive me my sins , that he may deign to grant <unk> joys through his own eternity and to look upon me with the sight of his holy vision . 
 Grant , I beseech you , O prophetic fathers , O you patriarchs , O you prophets of angelic distinction , O you leaders blessedly confessing with the Lord his holy governance – Abraham , Elijah , Enoch his companion , together with all the rest – that the king quickly deign to render skilfully his aid to me in the three sounds of ' O ' , lest the deceitful one , who rules in the front of the nine fallen orders , be able to say the word " <unk> " . 
 Now I beseech the ancient fathers with Peter their leader on behalf of wretched and anxious me : pour out your prayers and aid so that the <unk> custodian of each new saint may afterwards forgive me until I may overcome the hideous enemy of this world . 
 Christ , you grant . 
 In the late tenth century , Latin had higher prestige than Anglo @-@ Saxon , and hermeneutic Latin had higher prestige than simple Latin . This presented Byrhtferth with a problem in his Enchiridion , a school text designed to teach the complicated rules for calculating the date of Easter , as hermeneutic Latin is unsuitable for pedagogic instruction . His solution was to include passages in hermeneutic Latin condemning the ignorant and lazy secular clergy , who he said refused to learn Latin , thus justifying using Anglo @-@ Saxon to provide clear explanations for their benefit . In a passage in Latin he wrote : 
 Some ignorant clerics reject calculations of this kind ( for shame ! ) and do not wish to keep their phylacteries , that is , they do not preserve the order , which they have received in the bosom of mother church , nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation . They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees , and they should spit out their doctrine like filth . A cleric ought to be the keeper of his own soul , just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke , so he ought to subject his own soul to service , by filling the alabaster box with precious oil , that is , he ought to be inwardly subjected daily , by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer . 
 Byrhtferth aimed for an elevated style , but he was frequently guilty of solecisms caused by overreaching his ability in Latin . 
 Almost all proponents of the style were clerical , but there is one notable exception . Ealdorman Æthelweard was a descendant of King Æthelred I , grandfather of an Archbishop of Canterbury , and patron of Ælfric of Eynsham , the one major English writer of the period who rejected the style . Æthelweard 's Chronicon was a translation into hermeneutic Latin of a lost version of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . His style is regarded by historians as eccentric and at times unintelligible . In the view of Angelika Lutz his prose was influenced by Anglo @-@ Saxon heroic poetry as well as Latin and Greek sources : " That it was later viewed as a failure may be attributed both to his limited command of Latin grammar and his extreme stylistic pretensions . " 
 In 2005 Lapidge reflected : 
 Thirty years ago , when I first attempted to describe the characteristic features of tenth @-@ century Anglo @-@ Latin literature , I was rather naively bedazzled by the display of vocabulary which one encounters there . Because much of the vocabulary appeared to derive either from Aldhelm or from glossaries of the type called " <unk> " , I followed scholarly tradition and described the style as " hermeneutic " , on the assumption that the principal impulse behind the verbal display was that of dazzling the reader with arcane vocabulary exhumed from Greek @-@ Latin glossaries and authors such as Aldhelm . I now suspect that the perception needs modification : that the authors ' principal aim was not obfuscation , but was their ( misguided , perhaps ) attempt to reach in their prose a high stylistic register . 
 = = Decline = = 
 After the Norman Conquest authors rejected the hermeneutic style . The twelfth @-@ century chronicler William of Malmesbury expressed his disgust at language he considered bombastic . In Frank Stenton 's view , Byrhtferth 's hermeneutic life of Oswald gives a poor impression of the quality of English scholarship . He described it as " a disorderly work , written in a flamboyant prose , studded with strange words , which had to be explained by glosses inserted between the lines " . 
 Lapidge describes the repudiation of the hermeneutic style by modern scholars as disappointing . ″ Invariably it is castigated as ′ uncouth ′ or ′ barbarous ′ and its practitioners are dismissed with contempt as the fellows of <unk> . ″ In his view : " however unpalatable this style might be to modern taste , it was none the less a vital and pervasive aspect of late Anglo @-@ Saxon culture , and it deserves closer and more sympathetic attention than it has previously received " . 
 = Congo serpent eagle = 
 The Congo serpent eagle ( Dryotriorchis spectabilis ) is a species of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae , and is placed in the monotypic genus Dryotriorchis . This species is found in western and central Africa , with its range stretching from Sierra Leone south to Angola and west to the Democratic Republic of the Congo . It occurs in upper and lower Guinean forests , which are dense rainforests . This serpent eagle specializes in hunting in these forests ’ dark understories . It has two subspecies , the nominate subspecies Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis and Dryotriorchis spectabilis batesi . Though monotypic , it appears to be very closely related to Circaetus . This hawk is a medium @-@ sized bird with distinctive short , rounded wings and a long , rounded tail . It is varying shades of brown on its back and has a slight crest . Its breast is white with variable amounts of a rufous wash and , in the nominate subspecies , is covered in round , blackish spots . The subspecies D. s. batesi only has these dots on its flanks . The Congo serpent eagle closely resembles Cassin 's hawk @-@ eagle , and some ornithologists believe that this likeness is a rare example of avian mimicry . It is a very vocal raptor , and often is one of the most heard species in its habitat . 
 This serpent eagle feeds on snakes , chameleons , and toads , and hunts these species by dropping onto them from a perch in the understory . Its excellent eyesight enables it to hunt in the dark forest . Very little is known about its breeding habits , though it is suspected to breed from June to December . The Congo serpent eagle is listed as a species of Least Concern due to its large range and population . This species has been kept as a pet . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Congo serpent eagle was first described in 1863 by Hermann Schlegel as <unk> spectabilis from a specimen collected near Elmina , Ghana . Schlegel published his description in Nederlandsch Tijdschrift voor De <unk> and placed this species within the goshawks . In 1874 George Ernest Shelley , who had access to more specimens , realized that this bird wasn 't a goshawk and moved the species into its own monotypic genus , Dryotriorchis . Dryotriorchis is a distinct genus due to its short wings , long tail , short crest , and oval nostrils . The word " <unk> " is from the Greek for " oak " and " <unk> " from the Greek for " hawk " , specifically a kind of hawk thought to have three testicles . It is believed that the genus is more closely related to Circaetus than <unk> , and it is possibly a link between these and the Asian genus <unk> . The syrinx morphology is distinctly like those of accipiter hawks but shows similarities to features found in <unk> . Two subspecies are known : the nominate subspecies Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis and D. s. batesi . D. s. batesi was originally described as a separate species , Dryotriorchis batesi , by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1904 due to its unspotted breast . Sharpe named the subspecies in honor of G. L. Bates , who shipped him specimens from Cameroon . This species is also known as the West African Serpent eagle and the African Serpent @-@ eagle . 
 The Congo serpent eagle is superficially similar in plumage and size to Cassin 's hawk @-@ eagle , which has an overlapping range with the serpent eagle . It has been suggested that the Congo serpent eagle evolved to mimic the Cassin 's hawk @-@ eagle , which could give the serpent eagle several advantages , possibly including the ability to trick its reptilian prey into not fleeing , lowering its own predation , and / or minimizing mobbing by birds through its resemblance to a predator of birds . D. s. spectabilis more closely resembles the immature Cassin 's hawk @-@ eagle , while D. s. batesi resembles the adult . This is one of very few suspected examples of avian mimicry . 
 = = Description = = 
 This hawk is a medium @-@ sized , slender species with short , rounded wings and a long , rounded tail . It is 54 to 60 centimeters ( 21 to 24 in ) long , with the tail contributing 24 @.@ 5 to 26 @.@ 8 centimeters ( 9 @.@ 6 to 10 @.@ 6 in ) . The wingspan is 94 to 106 centimeters ( 37 to 42 in ) across . The adult of the nominate subspecies , Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis , has a blackish @-@ brown crown and upper neck while the sides of the neck and a broad collar are a dark rufous @-@ brown . The feathers on the top of the head are slightly pointed , giving this species a hint of a crest . The remaining upperparts are a dark chocolate brown . The cheeks are light brown while the throat is buffy white with streaks . The eyes are large and dark brown or grey in females and yellow in males while the beak is short but deep . It also has a black median streak . The bird 's underparts are white with variable amounts of rufous wash and a number of large , round blackish spots . The serpent eagle 's thighs are barred sepia @-@ brown and white , while the undertail is white . The underwing is largely white with some black spots and brown coloration . The tail is light brown , with five to six broad black bars . The claws are short and sharp , while the legs are yellow . Sexes are similar , though the female averages about three percent larger than the male . <unk> have a white crown and mantle , while the upper back has rounded brown or black spots that vanish as the bird ages . The wings and tail are greyish @-@ brown and paler than those of the adults and are more darkly barred . 
 D. s. batesi is similar to the nominate subspecies , but is browner and paler on the back while the spots on D. s. spectabilis 's chest only appear on this subspecies ' flanks . The immature does possess a spotted chest , with the spots vanishing as the bird ages . 
 This is a very vocal raptor and is one of the most frequently heard birds of prey in its range . It makes a cat @-@ like meowing sound as well as a low , mournful , nasal " cow @-@ cow @-@ cow " at intervals over extended periods of time . When heard over a large distance , some ornithologists have compared its call to that of a turaco .

 The Congo serpent eagle lives in southern Sierra Leone and Guinea , Liberia , and southern Côte d 'Ivoire and Ghana . It is also found in southern Nigeria and the Central African Republic south through northern and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east and through Gabon into the northern Republic of the Congo in the west with an isolated population in northern Angola . D. s. spectabilis is found in upper Guinean forests from Liberia to northern Cameroon , while D. s. batesi is found in lower Guinean forests from southern Cameroon through Gabon and western Uganda .

 Little is known about this species ' behavior . The Congo serpent eagle lives in the understory of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs in tall trees . It lives either alone or in pairs . This species is known to hunt snakes , lizards , especially chameleons , toads , and potentially small mammals . It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory , where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet ; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting . Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light , though it is diurnal . Studies on the species ' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human 's . It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .

 = 2013 Rosario gas explosion = 
 A gas explosion in a residential area of Rosario , the third @-@ largest city in Argentina , occurred on August 6 , 2013 . It was caused by a large gas leak ; a nearby building collapsed , and others were at high risk of structural failure . Twenty @-@ two people died , and sixty were injured . Several organizations helped secure the area , search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes . Shortly after the explosion , the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months . 
 The provincial judiciary launched an investigation into the cause of the explosion . Primary suspects were Litoral Gas ( the natural @-@ gas provider for Rosario ) and an employee who carried out maintenance work at the building that day . Several public figures sent condolences , and most of the candidates for the 2013 primary elections suspended their political campaigns . 
 = = The event = = 
 The explosion occurred at 9 : 30 a.m. near the intersection of <unk> and Salta Streets in central Rosario . Initial reports confirmed eight people dead , sixty injured and fifteen missing ; eight more deaths were later confirmed . Searches the following day revealed twelve fatalities , ten of whom were identified . A number of people were missing ; some were found dead among the debris , while others were rescued . The search for survivors ended on August 13 , with twenty @-@ two people confirmed dead . A 65 @-@ year @-@ old woman who had been injured died on October 8 . 
 The explosion was caused by a gas leak in a 30 @-@ year @-@ old building . It severely damaged a nearby nine @-@ story apartment building , causing it to collapse . Mónica Fein , mayor of Rosario , asked residents to avoid the area because of the risk that more buildings might collapse , and to ease the work of disaster management personnel . The streets were covered with broken glass from damaged buildings . Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected , and the national government sent an Argentine Federal Police task force to the scene . 
 The natural gas supplier , Litoral Gas , immediately began sealing the distribution pipe to the area . The Center for Ambulatory Medical Specialties of Rosario ( Spanish : Centro de <unk> Médicas <unk> de Rosario ) managed the information about the dead and injured , and tents were prepared for those left homeless . Firefighters and other workers found people trapped on the upper floors of buildings and evacuated them over adjacent roofs . Although the building was not destroyed by the explosion , a high risk of structural failure remained . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 Neighbors reported to the press that they had smelled a gas leak several hours before the explosion and had called Litoral Gas . Company director José María González said that the company had received no such calls , and thought that callers might have dialed the 911 emergency number instead . Prosecutor <unk> reported at the trial that the building had experienced several gas leaks before the explosion . 
 The provincial judiciary launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the explosion . The prosecution conducted a search and seizure at the offices of Litoral Gas to confirm the absence of customer complaints about the gas leak . Judge Juan Carlos Curto ordered the arrest of Carlos Osvaldo García , an employee of the department responsible for gas service to the area . He was captured during the night , and his assistant Pablo Miño surrendered to police the following day . According to witnesses , one employee fled in a van before the explosion , when he realized the severity of the gas leak , while another remained to try to evacuate people from the endangered area . The van belonged to García , who experienced an acute stress reaction during the trial . Curto checked the remnants of the gas employee 's workshop to verify García 's testimony . 
 Prosecutor Graciela Argüelles said that , according to the investigation , Litoral Gas ignored calls for help from García , who was not properly trained to manage such a situation . The judge suggested that documents seized from Litoral Gas might prove the existence of customer reports of a gas leak . Curto thought that the employees might not bear sole responsibility , and that the liability of Litoral Gas had to be investigated as well . 
 Pablo Miño was released from prison , but Curto refused to release García , saying that Miño had extenuating circumstances which García did not . Miño 's job was to give García the required tools , not to do the maintenance . He was in the street , watching over the van , which was not properly parked and locked , and did not see García 's work before the explosion . Curto stopped short of pronouncing Miño innocent at that early stage . 
 As the case expanded beyond his jurisdiction , Curto recused himself from the trial and was replaced by Javier Beltramone , who released García from prison . Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone 's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press . The appeal court agreed in a 2 – 1 vote to remove Beltramone , and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta . García had claimed that he was following instructions received in the days before the explosion , so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point . Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion . 
 Litoral Gas proposed an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement to the relatives of the victims , offering about 1200 US dollars per square meter of collapsed building , in addition to compensation for loss of life . Vice Governor Jorge Henn rejected it as immoral , and most of the families also initially rejected the proposal . By May 2014 , however , almost half of the families had accepted the settlement .

 The explosion occurred shortly before the primary 2013 Argentine legislative elections on August 11 . The governor of Santa Fe province , Antonio Bonfatti , asked the political parties to end their campaigns to allow mourning for the victims of the explosion . The Front for Victory and Progressive , Civic and Social Front candidates suspended their campaigns , and the national government declared two days of mourning . The period of mourning was observed by all candidates in Buenos Aires and most other provinces , who ended their political campaigns . 
 President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , who had recently returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations , visited the site of the explosion on August 7 . She was berated by local residents ; some were angry because her surprise visit halted work at the site , and others thought her presence was politically motivated . The president stayed briefly , visited the <unk> and met Bonfatti . Kirchner 's entourage was surrounded by members of La Cámpora , who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay . 
 Weeks before the explosion , several social networking sites had scheduled a country @-@ wide cacerolazo ( a pot @-@ banging protest demonstration ) , known as 8A , against Kirchner for August 8 . The websites had already conducted successful cacerolazos ( 8N and 18A ) . Despite the national mourning , the 8A protest went ahead as planned , with the added slogan " No more pointless deaths " . Candidate Ricardo Gil <unk> thought the cacerolazo should have been canceled , as the campaigning was , but fellow candidate Rodolfo Terragno supported it . It was attended by fewer people than previous ones in Buenos Aires and the rest of the country . The demonstration in Rosario was not a cacerolazo , but a silent candlelight vigil attended by nearly a hundred people . There was a second demonstration in Rosario on August 22 , proceeding from the National Flag Memorial to the headquarters of Litoral Gas . 
 Pope Francis sent a letter of condolence to Archbishop José Luis <unk> of Rosario , and it was read during a mass and procession for Saint Cajetan at Plaza 25 de Mayo . Newell 's Old Boys and Rosario Central , two local soccer teams and rivals in the Rosario derby , organized a charity match for the victims at the Gabino Sosa stadium , and Rosario @-@ born Lionel Messi provided support through the " Leo Messi " charity . The charity match collected 120 @,@ 000 pesos . Musicians Fito Páez , <unk> , <unk> , Las Pelotas , <unk> <unk> , Ciro <unk> , Lisandro <unk> , Pablo <unk> and Coki de <unk> performed concerts in several Argentine cities to raise money for the victims . 
 = = Reconstruction = = 
 Bonfatti announced that Santa Fe province would provide financial help to the victims of the explosion . Since most houses in the vicinity were damaged , affected families would receive a subsidy of $ 20 @,@ 000 to rent homes during reconstruction . They would receive $ 50 @,@ 000 in credit to buy furniture and appliances , payable in 60 months with five percent interest . Rosario 's real estate firms prepared a list of houses for rent without charging victims their regular fee . Some of the affected buildings may have had cheap insurances which would not cover the risk of an explosion . Some cars trapped in an underground parking lot could not be retrieved . 
 When the search for survivors ended , authorities closed Salta Street . Engineers began checking the buildings at ground zero , trying to restore the original layout of the street and demolishing unstable structures . Secretary of Public Works Omar Saab said that the two remaining buildings were beyond repair and had to be demolished . As a sign of respect , the demolition would not be carried out with explosives . Secretary of Housing Gustavo Leone estimated that the work would take nearly six months . People were allowed to enter their destroyed houses in small groups at a time , starting on August 9 . Nearby streets began to be reopened on August 13 . 
 The CGT union signed a deal with the association of factories of Rosario and the government of Rosario to make sure that all the victims of the explosions would keep their jobs . 
 = King John 's Hunting Lodge , Axbridge = 
 King John 's Hunting Lodge is a wool @-@ merchant 's house built c . 1460 in Axbridge , a town in the English county of Somerset . It is a jettied timber @-@ frame building of three storeys , occupying a corner plot on the town square . The building has served a variety of purposes with shops on the ground floor and workshops and living quarters on the first and second floors . At one time The King 's Head Inn occupied part of the building and a sculpture of a king 's head , which acted as a sign for the pub is preserved within , and a replica is attached to the outside . The lodge was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1971 , and repairs were undertaken to reverse significant deterioration to the building . 
 The house is leased by the National Trust to Axbridge and District Museum Trust , who operate it as a local museum which includes exhibits relating to local geology and history from the Neolithic to World War II . It is a Grade II * listed building . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1340 the site of the present building was occupied by a building belonging to John <unk> . It contained shops and was called " the <unk> " . The current building , which was constructed around 1460 , was occupied by shops on the ground floor , living areas and workshops on the first floor , and storage and sleeping areas on the second floor . 
 The house is the finest of a number of timber @-@ frame houses in the High Street and The Square . The three @-@ storey building is jettied on two adjacent sides and has three gables on the longer side . On the first and second floors curved brackets can be seen which support the floor above . The structure is based around a single wooden post , known as a king post , at the front corner of the building , which supports the floor boards and the horizontal dragon beams that carry the projection of the upper floors at each level . 
 In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , the building housed a succession of shops and underwent various changes which contributed to its physical decline . A Miss Ripley bought the building in 1930 , and used it to store her collection of antiques until 1968 , allowing the public to see her collection once a year . She bequeathed it to the National Trust in 1971 , who undertook the works necessary to make it fit for visitors and saved it from probable destruction . 
 In overhauling the structure of the premises , the National Trust restored its medieval character by recreating on the ground floor the appearance of arcaded stalls opening onto the street , and the sixteenth @-@ century decoration of the upstairs windows , although this caused a dilemma as it required the removal of fine 18th @-@ century windows . 
 The origin of the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John , who died in 1216 . Its present name first appeared in a 1915 publication , The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight , when it was being run as a saddler 's shop . The royal part of the name may have come from the fact that there was a carved king 's head on the building , from a time when The King 's Head Inn occupied part of the premises , but whether this represented King John or another king is not known . The head was attached to one corner of the exterior , but is now inside the building , and a replica placed on the outside . 
 = = Museum = = 
 The property is owned by the National Trust and run as a local history museum by Axbridge and District Museum Trust with support from Somerset County Museums Service and Axbridge Archaeological and Local History Society . Until 2011 funding was received from Sedgemoor District Council , but this was withdrawn and an entry charge introduced to help pay for the running costs . 
 The museum aims to illustrate the history , geology and community of Axbridge and the surrounding area ( the area of the old Axbridge Rural District , which included many neighbouring villages such as Cheddar , Wedmore , Mark and <unk> ) . There is a core of long @-@ term and permanent exhibits , reviewed regularly for possible changes , updates , and revised displays and information , and there is a programme of temporary exhibitions to reflect many aspects of local life and heritage . 
 Each room has a specific theme , which includes aspects of local history such as life during World War II , and aspects of law and order . Another exhibition shows local geology and archaeological finds from local caves . The exhibits include a fine flint flake which has been identified from the Neolithic occupation of Ebbor Gorge . The museum also displays paintings of local scenes and objects including a clock made by John Bilbie of the Bilbie family , who lived in Axbridge , and a merchants ' table known as a " nail " , similar to those outside The Exchange in Bristol which were made with a flat top and raised edges to prevent coins from tumbling onto the pavement . 
 = Effects of Hurricane Charley in Jamaica = 
 The effects of Hurricane Charley in Jamaica included one fatality and at least $ 1 million in damages . Forming out of a tropical wave on August 9 , 2004 , Charley quickly tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea and attained tropical storm status on August 10 . While passing south of Jamaica on August 11 , the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane . During its passage of Jamaica , Charley had maximum winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , a low @-@ end Category 1 hurricane . Turning north , the storm impacted western Cuba as a Category 3 storm before making landfall in Florida as a strong Category 4 . The storm eventually dissipated on August 15 . As Charley approached Jamaica , officials issued tropical storm watches and warnings before issuing a hurricane watch . Two cruise ships were diverted from docking in Jamaica , affecting 5 @,@ 700 passengers . Numerous shelters were set up across the island ; however , relatively few people sought refuge in them . 
 Although it was only a Category 1 hurricane , Charley caused significant damage in southern Jamaica . Saint Elizabeth Parish sustained the worst damage . About 750 farmers reported damage , and at one point , flooding isolated 30 families . The only fatality in Jamaica occurred after a man attempted to rescue a family but was swept away by flood waters . Following the storm , search and rescue teams were deployed to flooded regions . Days later , officials allocated roughly $ 7 @.@ 6 million ( JMD ; US $ 86 @,@ 000 ) to repair damaged roads . Residents in areas that sustained severe agricultural losses also requested assistance from the government .

 Hurricane Charley began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa in early August 2004 . Tracking westward , the system gradually organized and was declared a tropical depression on August 9 while located roughly 115 mi ( 185 km ) south @-@ southeast of Barbados . The following day , the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Charley after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea . Quickly tracking northwest , the small storm intensified . 
 Late on August 11 , as Charley traveled south of Jamaica , it attained hurricane intensity , with winds reaching 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Over the following days , the storm curved northeast and impacted western Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane before striking Florida as an intense Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) on August 13 . The weakened Charley rapidly tracked northeast before dissipating on August 15 near Long Island , New York . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 On August 10 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) , based in Miami , Florida , issued a tropical storm watch for the entire island of Jamaica as Tropical Storm Charley intensified over the eastern Caribbean Sea . Later that day , the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm quickly approached the island . Early on August 11 , a hurricane watch was declared for the island as Charley neared hurricane intensity . Late on August 11 , all watches and warnings for Jamaica were changed to hurricane warnings as Charley attained Category 1 status on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . The warning was later discontinued on August 12 as Hurricane Charley tracked towards Cuba , no longer a threat to Jamaica . 
 Following the issuance of hurricane watches , Robert Pickersgill , Minister of Transport and Works in Jamaica closed both airports , Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport , on the island and shut down all ports . A total of 33 flights were canceled or delayed by the storm . Roughly 3 @,@ 000 passengers from the Carnival Conquest cruise ship were diverted from their scheduled arrival in Montego Bay , resulting in millions of dollars in losses . Another cruise ship , The Triumph , carrying 2 @,@ 700 passengers was also diverted . Most businesses on the island were closed on August 12 . Emergency shelters were set up across the island ahead of the storm ; however , press reports indicate that no one sought refuge in shelters . Residents along the coast were urged to evacuate by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management due to the risk of storm surge and large swells that could inundate low @-@ lying communities . Up to 6 in ( 150 mm ) of rain fell in eastern portions of the island , triggering mudslides . 
 On August 11 , the Jamaica Red Cross opened its Emergency Operations Center in preparation for Hurricane Charley and placed the warning level at one , the lowest warning level . Residents throughout the country stocked up on emergency supplies and non @-@ perishable food , noted by an increase in sales at shops . In Saint James Parish , emergency officials activated all necessary agencies by August 11 . Late on August 11 , emergency officials quickly opened 50 shelters in the parish . In Saint Elizabeth Parish , 100 residents sought refuge in the six shelters opened throughout the parish . A total of $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( JMD ; US $ 17 @,@ 000 ) was allocated by the Ministry of Local Government for repairs after the storm . The Jamaica Red Cross alerted local branches to be prepared as Charley approached . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 On August 11 , a 60 ft ( 18 m ) yacht carrying three people was disabled roughly 58 mi ( 93 km ) southeast of the Morant Cays . The Jamaica Defence Force Coast Guard rescued the crew members the following day and brought them to Kingston Public Hospital as they were severely dehydrated and exhausted . During the preparations , storms ahead of the hurricane knocked out power in isolated areas . After nearly completing restoration of the initial power outage , lightning struck a power line and left more residents without electricity . 
 The community of Big Woods was significantly affected by flooding , with 30 families being isolated in the area . The only fatality from the storm also occurred in this community after a man was washed away while trying to rescue a family . The severity of damage in Big Woods prompted Jamaica Labour Party Area Council Four chairman to state that it should be declared a disaster area . Torrential rains during a two @-@ hour span overnight triggered most of the flooding in the area , isolating many homes and inundating several . In Westmoreland Parish , severe flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways . One home sustained significant damage after a large tree fell on it . In Kingston , high winds damaged power lines and some homes . Water supply to most regions was cut due to damage to pipelines and high water turbidity . Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines . 
 The banana industry sustained severe losses , with trees downed and fruit damaged and numerous livestock drowned in flood waters . Initial assessments of agricultural losses from the storm reached $ 300 million ( JMD ; US $ 3 @.@ 4 million ) . Residents requested the government for immediate assistance as families were without a source of food and income . Official assessments in four parishes placed the damage to agriculture and livestock at $ 88 @.@ 4 million ( JMD ; US $ 1 million ) , with roughly $ 73 @.@ 5 million ( JMD ; US $ 835 @,@ 000 ) of this accounting for 750 farmers in Saint Elizabeth . 
 Roads in Saint Elizabeth sustained substantial damage , with 32 separate roads experiencing severe impacts . Throughout the country , a total of $ 7 @.@ 6 million ( JMD ; US $ 86 @,@ 000 ) was provided to repair the roads , $ 4 @.@ 23 million ( JMD ; US $ 48 @,@ 000 ) of which was used in Saint Elizabeth alone . Widespread damage to crops also resulted in an increased price in store costs . The loss to farmers was untimely as it followed a three @-@ month drought that was preceded by damaging hailstorms that ruined crops . Following the storm , search and rescue teams were deployed , mainly in Saint Elizabeth Parish following reports of flooding . 
 = The Boat Race 2003 = 
 The 149th Boat Race took place on 6 April 2003 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along a 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) tidal stretch of the River Thames in south @-@ west London . The lead changed twice during the race , which Oxford won by one foot ( 30 cm ) , the smallest margin of victory in the history of the event . The close race has been described as " epic " , while multiple Olympic gold @-@ medallist Steve Redgrave suggested that the race was the " greatest we will see in our lifetimes " . 
 Umpired by the Boat Race veteran Boris Rankov , the 2003 race was the first to be scheduled on a Sunday . As a result of a collision between the Cambridge boat and a launch , a member of the Cambridge crew was replaced just two days before the race . This was the first Boat Race to feature two sets of brothers on opposing sides . In the reserve race Goldie beat Isis and Oxford won the Women 's race . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course , between Putney and Mortlake on the River Thames in south @-@ west London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the 2003 race as reigning champions , having won the previous year 's race by three @-@ quarters of a length , but Cambridge led overall with 77 victories to Oxford 's 70 ( excluding the " dead heat to Oxford by five feet " of 1877 ) . The race was sponsored by Aberdeen Asset Management for the fourth consecutive year , and was the first to be scheduled on a Sunday , in order to avoid a clash with the live television broadcast of the Grand National . Although the 1984 race was held on a Sunday , it had been postponed from the Saturday following a collision between the Cambridge boat and a barge . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat , has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 The umpire for the race was former Oxford rower Boris Rankov , who had represented the Dark Blues a record six times between 1978 and 1983 . Cambridge were coached by Robin Williams ( for the ninth time ) while Oxford 's coach was Sean Bowden , assisted by coxing adviser Dan Topolski . 
 = = Crews = = 
 Wayne Pommen , the first @-@ choice Cambridge bow , was injured two days before the race , fracturing his wrist following a full @-@ speed collision with the harbourmaster 's launch during a practice start . Matthias <unk> was hit on the head but did not require medical attention . Cambridge number seven James Livingston said : " For a couple of seconds I thought I was going to die . We were going flat out and all of a sudden I heard Jim 's voice . I 've never heard so much fear in anybody 's voice before . " Pommen was circumspect : " A few of us were feeling quite lucky last night ... at the same time , it was very frustrating and disappointing ... but there was no point sulking in the corner . " Three oars were destroyed and two riggers bent ; the boat was sent to Weybridge to be repaired . Pommen was replaced by Ben Smith , brother of the Oxford stroke Matthew . Not since the 1979 race had such a late change in the line @-@ up of a crew been made . Along with James and David Livingston , this was the first time in the history of the Boat Race that two pairs of brothers would be racing against one another . 
 The official weigh @-@ in took place on 1 April at the London Eye . The Cambridge crew had an advantage of 7 kilograms ( 15 lb ) per member , representing the largest disparity between the crews since the 1990 event and the lightest Dark Blue crew since the 1975 race . Oxford were considered " underdogs " for the race . The Cambridge crew had an average age of 23 , while Oxford 's crew averaged 21 . The Oxford crew featured seven Britons , an Australian and a Canadian , while the Cambridge crew consisted of four Britons , two Americans , two Germans and an Australian . Cambridge 's Tim Wooge , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old stroke rowing in his third Boat Race , was the first German president of Cambridge University Boat Club , and the heaviest man in the race . His Dark Blue counterpart Matthew Smith was rowing in his fourth Boat Race . Robin Bourne @-@ Taylor , Basil Dixon and Matt Smith had rowed for Oxford in the 2002 race , while , in James Livingston , Cambridge saw just one Blue return from the previous year 's event .

 Cambridge won the coin toss and the Light Blue boat club president , Tim Wooge , was clear : " Cambridge choose Surrey " . Cambridge elected to start from the southern bank ( the " Surrey side " ) of the Thames , handing the northern side of the river ( the " Middlesex side " ) to Oxford . At race time , conditions were overcast and breezy . Oxford took an early lead with a slightly higher stroke rate than Cambridge as both coxes were warned by the umpire to avoid a clash . By the Mile Post , the Dark Blues were half @-@ a @-@ second ahead . Five minutes into the race , Oxford , with a third of a length lead , were warned again by the umpire and moved away from the racing line , and following a series of oar clashes , allowed Cambridge to take the lead , shooting Hammersmith Bridge a second ahead . Oxford continued to stay in touch with Cambridge along the long middle bend of the course , towards the Chiswick Steps , and retook the lead on the approach to Barnes Bridge as the course curved back in their favour . With a three @-@ quarter length lead at Barnes , Oxford began to weaken and Cambridge recovered to a third of a length . With every stroke , the Cambridge boat gained on Oxford , outrating them in a " sprint finish " , but the Dark Blues passed the finishing post 1 foot ( 30 cm ) ahead , the narrowest winning margin in the history of the race . 
 Oxford finished with a time of 18 minutes 6 seconds . Rankov did not initially announce the result , instead he " spread his arms wide and shrugged his shoulders " . The result was confirmed to Rankov by finishing judge Ben Kent , with the winning margin being approximately 0 @.@ 05 seconds , and announced to the crews by Rankov under Chiswick Bridge : " One foot to Oxford " . James Livingston wrote of himself at the finish : " eyes widen and bulge in horror . Our desolation is total . " 
 It was the first time a crew had won the race with a deficit of more than one stone ( 6 @.@ 4 kg ) per man . It was Oxford 's third victory in the previous four years and brought the overall result to 77 – 71 in Cambridge 's favour . At the finish , following tradition , the Oxford crew threw their cox , Acer Nethercott , into the water in celebration .

 The Oxford University Boat Club president and stroke Matthew Smith said " It feels fantastic and I think it will take a while to top this feeling " . He went on to say : " We have got an awesome bunch of guys in this squad ... but I have such respect for Cambridge ... with a lighter crew we 've turned round the biggest weight deficit in history . " Nethercott remarked " I really thought we had lost . In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute , unbridled ecstasy . " The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said " It was the worst margin to lose by . I just wish I could stop losing these epic races " while the Cambridge coach Williams described the defeat as a " blow to the heart " . Wooge was disappointed : " I pull my hat off to Oxford , that was an amazing race . " Rankov later revealed " It ’ s the hardest I ’ ve ever had to work in an umpiring situation . " 
 The five @-@ time Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave , who presented the trophy to the victorious president , Matthew Smith , commented on the race : " Remember that race and cling on to the memory , because it will be the greatest we will see in any of our lifetimes . " An estimated 400 million people worldwide watched the event on television , with over 5 million viewers watching on BBC One in the United Kingdom . The race is retold in the book Blood Over Water , authored by opposing brothers James and David Livingston . 
 Martin Cross , writing in The Guardian , said the race provided " a thrilling finish and renewed interest from the public " , Christopher Dodd in The Independent called the race " stupendous , a titanic struggle of will " , while Rachel Quarrell of The Daily Telegraph declared Oxford 's victory as " epic " and suggested that " there will never be a better Boat Race . " Simon Barnes of The Times described the finish : " At the finishing line , the bobble of the Oxford bow was inches in front , a second later , it was inches behind . If the line had come with the completion rather than the beginning of the final Cambridge stroke , the result would have gone the other way . " Author and journalist Christopher Dodd , writing in Rowing News summarised the race as " incredible " and a " titanic struggle of wills " . 
 = 14th / 32nd Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 14th / 32nd Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army which served during the Second World War . It was formed in September 1942 by the amalgamation of the 14th and 32nd Battalions and was assigned to the 6th Brigade , 4th Division in Geraldton , Western Australia . The battalion served firstly in Australia and then later New Guinea , being employed mainly on garrison duties , before being transferred to the 5th Division and deployed to New Britain late in the war where it took part briefly in the Australian containment campaign on that island . In April 1945 it returned to Australia for rest and re @-@ organisation and was disbanded later that year without seeing further combat .

 = = = Formation = = = 
 By mid @-@ 1942 , an over mobilisation of Australia 's military forces resulted in a manpower shortage in the Australian economy . In order to rectify this situation , the Australian government decided to amalgamate and disband a number of units from the Militia in order to free up their personnel and return them to the civilian workforce . As a result , on 12 October 1942 , the 14th and 32nd Battalions , which had been undertaking garrison duties around Geraldton , Western Australia , were amalgamated to form the 14th / 32nd Battalion . Upon formation the battalion adopted the territorial title of the " Prahran / Footscray Regiment " and was assigned to the 6th Brigade , 4th Division . 
 The battalion 's personnel were drawn predominately from the 14th Battalion , although 164 officers and men from the 32nd who had volunteered to serve under the same conditions of the Second Australian Imperial Force , were transferred to the 14th / 32nd at this time . As more than 65 per cent of the battalion 's 996 personnel <unk> overseas service , the battalion was designated as an Australian Imperial Force battalion , meaning that it could be sent outside the territorial limits imposed by the Defence Act ( 1903 ) . 
 = = = New Guinea and New Britain = = = 
 After this , the 14th / 32nd Battalion was moved to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland , to undertake amphibious landing and jungle warfare training in preparation for deployment overseas . In July 1943 , they were sent to Port Moresby , New Guinea , where they once again filled the role of garrison troops for almost a year , operating between Buna , Gona and Nassau Bay . In 1944 , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell , who had previously commanded at company @-@ level in Greece and the Middle East , the battalion was attached to the 5th Division and on 4 November the 14th / 32nd Battalion , forming the vanguard of the 6th Brigade , carried out an amphibious landing at Jacquinot Bay on New Britain . 
 Although opposition to the landing was expected , the 14th / 32nd Battalion arrived on the beach and found that the Japanese defenders had withdrawn further down the coast . This allowed the battalion to concentrate on the task of establishing a beachhead and unloading stores . This task was made more difficult though by a torrential downpour on 6 November , nevertheless they were eventually able to establish themselves around Pal Mal Mal Plantation and patrols were sent out to locate the Japanese . By 10 November , patrols reached the <unk> River and after contacting locals it was found that the Japanese were withdrawing towards the Gazelle Peninsula , where it was estimated that about 93 @,@ 000 Japanese were stationed . Due to the size of the Japanese garrison , as the rest of the 5th Division began to arrive on the island , it was decided that the Australians would undertake a campaign of containment rather than engage in offensive operations . As a part of this campaign , the 14th / 32nd Battalion was assigned the task of advancing 75 miles ( 121 km ) along the coast from Jacquinot Bay to Henry Reid Bay . With no roads and only narrow tracks , the going was difficult and in order to improve mobility the battalion used barges to carry out a series of landings as they advanced through <unk> and <unk> , passing around Wide Bay , before reaching Kalai Plantation in mid @-@ February 1945 . 
 At Kalai the battalion moved into the <unk> Mission where they received intelligence reports of a force of about 200 Japanese occupying a position at <unk> creek . Fighting patrols were sent out , but no contact was made , although evidence of occupation was found indicating that the Japanese were moving back to a defensive position to the north of <unk> river . Before they could launch an assault , however , the battalion was relieved by the 19th Battalion and on 28 February the 19th crossed the <unk> . Following this the Japanese withdrew back towards the mountains around the Waitavalo and Tol Plantations , and in early March an attempt was made to force a crossing on the <unk> river . After initially being turned back by intense Japanese mortar and machine @-@ gun fire , the 19th made a successful second attempt , forcing the Japanese back further towards Mount Sugi and Bacon Hill . 
 As orders were passed for an attack to be made on this position , the 14th / 32nd was brought up to relieve the 19th . The Japanese position sat atop a 600 @-@ foot ( 180 m ) hill which rose steeply , up to 45 degrees in some places , from the jungle below . In preparation , the 14th / 32nd occupied a number of positions around Bacon Hill and at 9 : 55 am on 16 March 1945 the attack began with two companies , ' B ' and ' D ' , attacking under the cover of an intense artillery barrage provided by elements of the 2 / 14th Field Regiment , with direct fire support being provided by ' A ' and ' C ' Companies from the high ground surrounding the hill . The Japanese defences were well @-@ prepared though , and machine @-@ gun and mortar fire from well @-@ sited positions soon pinned down two platoons from ' B ' Company . In order to regain momentum , a flanking move to the left was undertaken by ' D ' Company , but after two hours they too came under intense machine @-@ gun fire as they attempted to round Mount Sugi and attack the Japanese from the rear , forcing them to dig @-@ in to the north of Bacon Hill . At this point the situation became quite desperate for the attackers , and a number of Australian platoons found themselves embroiled in an intense battle . Finally , late in the day , after having lost 10 men killed and another 13 wounded the attack was called off . The attack was resumed early the following day with two companies attacking from the north and digging @-@ in on the eastern approaches to the hill while two platoons clambered up the steep western slope amidst heavy Japanese mortar and grenade attacks . By nightfall the Australians , who had lost a further six men killed and 17 wounded , were in control of most of the position , although two Japanese positions were still holding out . On 18 March the attack was resumed and finally , by 3 : 00 pm , the last Japanese had been cleared from the hill . 
 Following the battle , the battalion continued patrolling operations beyond the Waitavalo – Tol area but no further contact was made . On 21 March when they were relieved once more by the 19th Battalion . A week later , on 28 March , the 13th Brigade began to relieve the units of the 6th Brigade , and over the following fortnight the transition took place . On 12 April the battalion returned to Kalai where they received the news that they were being returned to Australian for rest and re @-@ organisation in preparation for further operations . On 7 May 1945 they embarked upon the troopship Duntroon , arriving in Brisbane a week later .

 = Winter : Five Windows on the Season = 
 Winter : Five Windows on the Season is a non @-@ fiction book written by Adam Gopnik for the 2011 Massey Lectures . Each of the book 's five chapters had been delivered as a one @-@ hour lecture discussing artistic portrayals of winter : its impact on culture and societies , polar exploration , and winter recreation . Each lecture was held in a different Canadian city : Montreal on October 12 , Halifax on October 14 , Edmonton on October 21 , Vancouver on October 23 , and ending in Toronto on October 26 . The book was published by House of Anansi Press while the lectures were broadcast on CBC Radio One 's Ideas between November 7 – 11 . 
 While Gopnik was raised in Montreal , by 2011 he worked as a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine in New York City . Gopnik selected ' winter ' as his general topic and spent nearly a year preparing for the lectures . 
 = = Background = = 
 Adam Gopnik was selected to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures , the annual week @-@ long series of lectures on a political , cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar . Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College , House of Anansi Press and the CBC , the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures . This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC . Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel 's decision and to ask if he would accept . At the time Gopnik was living in New York City , working as a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine . He had previously authored several books on different topics , the most successful being Paris to the Moon , a collection of essays published in 2000 . Gopnik read Lucht 's email while waiting for a bus on Madison Avenue . Gopnik later stated that by the end of the 20 @-@ minute bus ride he had already selected a topic and had a good idea of the issues he would address . 
 Understanding the Massey Lectures were part of the Canadian culture , Gopnik , who was born in Philadelphia but lived in Montreal between the ages of 10 to 25 , wanted a topic that would be relevant to Canadians but also have universal appeal : winter . Winter had appeared as a theme or setting in many of his previous writings , and he especially looked forward to talking about ice hockey . Gopnik spent the next year researching and writing the book , alongside another non @-@ fiction book he was working on at the time : The Table Comes First : Family , France , and the Meaning of Food . This other book was released shortly after Winter , and purposefully contained one identical sentence . 
 = = Content = = 
 There are five chapters , each of which consider a different aspect of winter . The first chapter , " Romantic Winter " , describes how winter has been portrayed since the 1700s from the point of view of artists and writers . According to Gopnik , the view of winter has changed over time , from something that had to be overcome to something romanticized as hearths , glass windows , and coal heating made the cold more tolerable . Other factors , such as nationalism , religion , technology , also changed the social view of winter from being portrayed as " bleak and bitter to sweet and sublime " . The second chapter , " Radical Winter " , recounts the history of polar expeditions , including John Ross , John Franklin , Robert Peary , Robert Falcon Scott , Roald Amundsen , and Ernest Shackleton . 
 " <unk> Winter " reviews the cultural and social history of winter festivals and holidays . Gopnik posits that the modern Christmas is a compound holiday merging elements from numerous societies , traditions , and beliefs ; that its moral foundations were established in the 1820 / 30s ; its celebratory and commercialism elements were established in the 1870s . He also argues that stress and anxiety have been part of the holiday since the 1920s . " Recreational Winter " is about winter sports , like ice hockey . The evolution of ice skating is identified from the Dutch bringing the concept to England in the 1600s and the origin of hockey is traced back to a particular neighbourhood in Montreal in the 1800s . He portrays winter sports as being more about preparation and the pleasure of solitude , in contrast with summer sports , which are more about impulse . The final chapter , " Remembering Winter " , discusses three ways that the human experience of winter is changing : through technological and architectural innovations , via global warming , and by memory . 
 = = Style and themes = = 
 The chapters are written so that they could be read as lectures . Though several reviewers referred to them as essays , Gopnik made the distinction between an essay , which is written to be read silently , and a lecture , which is meant to be spoken and keeps some of the rhythm of speech . Gopnik purposefully tried " to keep them as conversational as possible [ and so ] they lack the polish of his New Yorker essays " . The lectures ' conversational tone , with both common and arcane references , was meant to appeal to a " middlebrow " audience ; they were designed to be " profound and significant " but not academic . The reviewer in The Observer described the writing as " designed to maintain a constant flame of curiosity in a lecture room shut against the cold " . 
 The book was called an " elegy for a season " . <unk> James Harley Marsh believes that the central theme was , as Gopnik himself writes , that " winter started as this thing we had to get through ; it has ended as this time to hold on to " . The Edmonton Journal reviewer describes Gopnik 's guiding metaphor for his approach to winter as " ice wine : sweetness made from stress " , that the perceived benefits of winter come directly from the hardships it brings . Ian McGillis in the Montreal Review of Books identifies " two simple ideas that govern and unite the five lectures " : first , that the view from inside can provide a better developed idea of what is outside , and second , that winter continues to defy the human need to consistently name and organize the world .

 The book was published by House of Anansi Press and released on September 26 , 2011 . The five chapters / lectures were delivered by Gopnik in five locations across Canada : the first chapter was delivered in Montreal on October 12 , the second in Halifax ( Dalhousie Arts Centre ) on October 14 , the third in Edmonton ( University of Alberta ) on October 21 , the fourth in Vancouver ( Chan Centre for the Performing Arts ) on October 23 , and the final chapter in The Royal Conservatory of Music at the University of Toronto on October 26 . Gopnik was in Guelph on October 25 where he recited passages and promoted the book . An excerpt was published in the October 3 edition of Maclean 's magazine . 
 Reviewers variously described the book as " interesting " , " charming " and " fascinating " and the prose as " eloquent " , " thoughtful " , but sometimes slow . The Publishers Weekly review stated that " Gopnik <unk> dense material with humor , and makes unwieldy concepts accessible through modern @-@ day comparisons " . Bill Rambo in the Winnipeg Free Press said that it " reads smoothly and effectively [ and demonstrates ] encyclopedic knowledge and incisive research into a subject " , concluding that the chapter Recreational Winter about sports was the most passionate . Charles Wilkins in The Globe and Mail found Remembering Winter , the chapter about cultural and social memories of winter to be the " most personal and poignant " and entertaining . Helen Gallagher in the New York Journal of Books " highly recommended " the book . 
 The book was published in the United Kingdom , in November 2012 , by Quercus , a London @-@ based independent publishing house . The review in The Daily Telegraph concluded that " while there are flashes of brilliance here , there 's also a nagging sense that he 's snatching at snowflakes . Time and time again one comes across statements that look , and sound good - these pieces were originally delivered as lectures - but which just don 't stand up to analysis . " The reviewer cited examples , like the illustrations of the theatrics people display when coming in from the cold and the isolated feelings of downhill skiers which the reviewer rebutted with similar examples of the same that occur in temperate climates . Nick Rennison reviewed the book for The Sunday Times , writing that " any writer who can take subjects as diverse as [ these ] .... and find something original and interesting to say about each of them , has to be worth reading .

 = Mother 's Milk = 
 Mother 's Milk is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers , released on August 16 , 1989 , on EMI Records . After the death of founding guitarist Hillel Slovak and subsequent departure of drummer Jack Irons , vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea regrouped with the addition of guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith . Frusciante 's influence altered the band 's sound by placing more emphasis on melody than rhythm , which had dominated the band 's previous material . Returning producer Michael Beinhorn favored heavy metal guitar riffs as well as overdubbing that was perceived by Frusciante as excessive , and as a result Beinhorn and Frusciante constantly fought over the album 's guitar sound . 
 The record was a greater commercial success than any of the Chili Peppers ' three previous studio albums . Mother 's Milk peaked at number 52 on the Billboard 200 and received widespread recognition for singles " Knock Me Down " and the Stevie Wonder cover " Higher Ground " . The album became their first gold record in early 1990 , and was the first step for the band in achieving international success . Although the record was not met with the same positive critical reception that its predecessor The Uplift Mofo Party Plan ( 1987 ) had garnered , Mother 's Milk , according to Amy Hanson of Allmusic , " turned the tide and transformed the band from underground funk @-@ rocking rappers to mainstream bad boys with seemingly very little effort " . Mother 's Milk would eventually go platinum .

 After Red Hot Chili Peppers received a record deal with EMI in 1983 , the group established themselves as a prominent funk rock band with their 1984 debut album The Red Hot Chili Peppers . Disappointed with the results of the production , vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea replaced guitarist Jack Sherman with founding member Hillel Slovak , who had quit his band , What Is This ? , several weeks before . The group 's George Clinton @-@ produced second album , Freaky Styley ( 1985 ) , was Slovak 's first effort with the band . The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , which was released in 1987 , saw original drummer Jack Irons return after he too left . The record , a critical success that peaked at number 148 on the Billboard 200 , is the only Red Hot Chili Peppers album the original members recorded together . Shortly following the ensuing tour , Slovak died of a heroin overdose and left the rest of the group in complete shock ; Irons , citing an inability to cope with the death , quit . Kiedis and Flea , similarly devastated , were determined to persevere despite the loss of two key members . In September 1988 they chose DeWayne " <unk> " McKnight , a friend of Clinton 's and former member of the funk band Parliament , to replace Slovak on guitar ; D. H. Peligro of the punk rock outfit Dead Kennedys replaced Irons . The new lineup made it through three shows before the band felt McKnight didn 't fit and he was fired . McKnight was so angry he threatened to burn Kiedis ' house down . McKnight however was with the band long enough to record " Blues for Meister " , the first Chili Peppers song featuring Flea on lead vocals and only song to feature Peligro as well . The song would appear a few years later on Out in L.A .. 
 The band wasn 't without a guitarist for very long . In October 1988 , Kiedis and Flea found a replacement for McKnight in teenage guitarist , John Frusciante . Flea had originally directed Frusciante to audition for the band Thelonious Monster . An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan , Frusciante was , according to Flea , " a really talented and knowledgeable musician . He [ Frusciante ] knows all the shit I don 't know . I basically know nothing about music theory and he 's studied it to death , inside and out . He 's a very disciplined musician — all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes . " Frusciante was also not very familiar with the funk genre : " I wasn 't really a funk player before I joined the band . I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [ Slovak 's ] playing and I just took it sideways from there . " 
 With Frusciante in place and Peligro still on drums , the band embarked on a small tour and began writing music for the next album . It wasn 't long though before the band felt they needed to part ways with Peligro as well , who had his own personal drug problems . Peligro , who helped co @-@ write " Stone Cold Bush " , " Taste the Pain " and " Sexy Mexican Maid " for the Mother 's Milk album , was fired in late November 1988 . Kiedis said it was one of the hardest things he had to do because they considered Peligro a good friend . 
 The band was now once again without a drummer and were forced to hold open auditions . The last to audition , Chad Smith , was a six @-@ foot three @-@ inch tall drummer who , according to Flea , " lit a fire under our asses " . Kiedis later said the audition with Smith left " [ the band ] in a state of frenzied laughter that we couldn 't shake out of for a half an hour " . Smith came from such a different background than his other three bandmates . Kiedis , Flea and Frusciante were more into the punk rock scene while Chad was into classic rock and heavy metal . Smith was officially hired in December 1988 and played a handful of shows with the band to finish out the year . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Unlike the stop @-@ start sessions for The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , where Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs , pre @-@ production for Mother 's Milk went smoothly . Many of the songs were already written , some even recorded ( " Taste the Pain " was recorded prior to Chad joining and featured Philip " Fish " Fisher on drums ) by the time the band started pre @-@ production in January 1989 . The band recorded basic tracks at Hully Gully studios in Silver Lake ; songs like " Knock Me Down " were formed from jam sessions without any input from returning producer Michael Beinhorn . According to Flea , the Hully Gully sessions bore fruit : " We played hard and fast more than [ at ] any other time in our career , I think . A lot of chops were going down [ ... ] we played constantly , got to know each other , and came up with a record . " Kiedis and Flea recognized that Frusciante 's presence had become a significant influence on the band 's new material as the Hully Gully sessions were proving to be extremely productive ; Flea recalled that " [ Frusciante ] was an immense new element to the sound of our band and a big opening up for us . " 
 The band entered the Ocean Way Recording studio in Hollywood in February 1989 to record Mother 's Milk . " It was weird when I first joined the band because we recorded the album after I 'd been in the band for just a few months and Chad had actually been in for just two weeks " , Frusciante recalled . " I was still a little bit confused about my position and we were just like four individuals . Music is all about welding people into a unit and with all the touring we 've been doing we 're now like an eight armed cosmic octopus ! " Beinhorn pushed the Chili Peppers to produce the best possible takes for each of the record 's thirteen tracks with the intent of the band obtaining a hit record . 
 Although there had been stress and conflict during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums , the Mother 's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn 's incessant desire to create a hit . He recalled that he and the band were at odds : " Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [ with the band ] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [ them ] . " Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects . According to Kiedis , " [ Beinhorn ] wanted John to have a big , crunching , almost metal @-@ sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid @-@ rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky , sexy , funky guitar tones . " Frusciante was frustrated with the producer 's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record , feeling it was too " macho " . Kiedis recalled that , in the end , " I couldn 't tolerate his direction any longer . He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn 't feeling , and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him . " 
 In March 1989 , the Chili Peppers embarked on a two @-@ month tour to break @-@ in the new lineup . The " Positive Mental Octopus tour " saw the band play small venues throughout the United States , including several concerts on the East and West Coast . During this period , Frusciante began to assert more energy and his ego " got a little swollen " , according to Flea , " He was running around being rude to girls and getting them pissed off . But that 's to be expected , I mean , shit , you 're 18 years old and you want to get laid really bad and all of a sudden you 're in a band , the girls want to fuck . You 're bound to go crazy . " Another incident , following a performance at the George Mason University in Fairfax , Virginia , caused legal repercussions ; a student accused Kiedis of engaging in sexual misconduct and indecent exposure . The vocalist was subsequently arrested and released on bail pending a trial that was to be set for a later date . 
 = = Music = = 
 The band 's style of music developed with the arrival of Frusciante ; producer Michael Beinhorn observed , " It was apparent early on that John was the perfect guitarist for the band — he brought the elements of songwriting and composition to the band which they 'd never truly had prior to his involvement . I believe that John is a pivotal figure in the Chili Peppers , being that he is such a distinctive songwriter . " Frusciante altered the band 's sound by introducing melodies , harmonies and more complex song structures . In contrast to the group 's previous albums , which featured groove and rhythm @-@ based songs , Mother 's Milk contained melodic compositions that reflected the new guitarist 's influence . Most of the record , due to Beinhorn 's presence , is composed of heavy metal guitar riffs and excessive layering . 
 Mother 's Milk features an array of musical styles in its thirteen tracks . Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989 , " Knock Me Down " became one of the most radical shifts in style for the band . The introspective lyrics , which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life , were a new approach for Kiedis , who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle . The vocalist did not , however , want the track to be associated with " anti @-@ drug " sentiments , claiming , " [ the song ] is about letting your friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others when you need it , whether it 's from drugs , or from a number of other personal problems . " According to music journalist Jeff Apter , the song " Knock Me Down " was " clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down ; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks . " Musically , the track integrates the Chili Peppers ' typical punk influences , but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory . " Knock Me Down " was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante , but the song was remixed before being released as a single ; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist 's voice instead of Kiedis ' . 
 " Higher Ground " became another song that helped the band achieve international success . Originally written and recorded in 1973 by R & B singer Stevie Wonder , the track was , according to Flea , a perfect cover for the band : " [ ... ] the lyrics are great . Especially as far as the situation that the band has been in , as far as state of mind , for the past few months . That song is really about raising and uplifting yourself spiritually . " The bassist affirmed that the reason the band covered the song was to pay homage to Wonder and the important role he played in popular music . The cover begins with a funk bass @-@ line , followed by multi @-@ layered heavy metal guitar progressions and effects @-@ treated vocals . " Higher Ground " ' s chorus features backing vocals from an array of friends and engineers who worked on the record ; the individuals ' competence in singing was irrelevant to the band because they sought to achieve a sense of unity . Mother 's Milk was composed of a variety of songs that expanded the Chili Peppers ' repertoire . The instrumental " Pretty Little <unk> " was one of the few songs that featured no guitar layering ; Apter notes that the song is " a dreamy , sweetly stoned instrumental featured deft picking and strumming from Frusciante , intertwined with blasts of trumpet from Flea . " The eclectic track was originally intended to be over three minutes long , but was cut to just under 2 minutes before the album 's release . " Taste the Pain " reflects a more meditative and melodic theme , similar to " Knock Me Down " . Frusciante introduces psychedelic guitar progressions in the verse , while the lyrics touch on themes of love and loss . Other tracks such as " Stone Cold Bush " presented topics of prostitution while " Punk Rock Classic " was , in retrospect , an emulation of typical punk rock songs by Black Flag and The Germs — bands that were influential to the Chili Peppers . 
 = = Artwork = = 
 Mother 's Milk features a black and white photograph of the band sprawled across the arms of a proportionately larger naked woman . A rose conceals one of her nipples while Kiedis ' standing body conceals the other . There were originally two women whose photographs were planned to be used , one being Kiedis ' girlfriend Ione Skye and the other being model Dawn <unk> ; the latter was ultimately chosen . Controversy arose , however , when Dawn claimed the band did not notify her that she was the one chosen to be on the cover of Mother 's Milk . Furthermore , several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity . A more strictly censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original . The cover of the record was influenced by a promotional poster Kiedis had from the 1960s of Sly and the Family Stone , in which frontman Sly Stone held a miniaturized band in his palm . When Kiedis was finding shots of the band to use on the cover , Frusciante initially refused every photograph the vocalist showed him but settled on one of him sitting down laughing . Mother 's Milk was affixed with an " explicit language " warning sticker that , according to Kiedis , " [ D ] <unk> 't bother me . Our lyrics are very explicit , whether it 's about sex or friendship or love for life in general . " The cover booklet of the record features a painting by Hillel Slovak . Following the album 's release , a limited number of promotional posters were issued with the model 's breasts exposed . Dawn had no knowledge of the pressing and sued the band , winning a $ 50 @,@ 000 settlement . 
 The singles for Mother 's Milk followed a similar artistic theme . The cover of " Knock Me Down " featured the band shirtless , in front of a photograph of an elephant in an African setting . " Higher Ground " was similar in that all four members — photographs of which were taken from the music video — were printed in front of a large image of Kiedis ' face . " Taste the Pain " featured the band together with a red and yellow background with the Chili Peppers ' asterisk adjacent to the typeface . 
 = = Promotion and release = = 
 A promotional 12 " titled For the Thrashers , which contained four songs from the album , was released to radio stations to promote the then forthcoming album in the weeks leading up to its release . Director Drew Carolan shot a promotional video for " Good Time Boys " which was released on the 1989 Hard ' n Heavy Vol . 2 collection . The video , which has never been released elsewhere by the band or even acknowledged as an official video , featured the band performing the song with cut away scenes of the band being interviewed discussing the album and their sound . Carolan was also hired to film the music videos for album 's first two singles , " Higher Ground " and " Knock Me Down " before the release of Mother 's Milk . The initial premise for " Higher Ground " was to have the song 's original writer , Stevie Wonder , sit in the lotus position as the Chili Peppers dance around him ; however , Wonder declined to be in the video . Kiedis gave full creative license to Carolan on the condition that he " make us [ the band ] look like the Gods of Funk . " While the video for " Higher Ground " was intended to be upbeat and exuberant , " Knock Me Down " was filmed to be more poignant ; Carolan recalls , " It was a very special track for the band and it needed to be treated with the utmost care and respect . Anthony and Flea just wanted it to be real soulful with a sense of urgency . " The videos took a day each to complete and were filmed with relatively small budgets , but the outcome , as Jeff Apter notes , " [ B ] <unk> key elements of [ the album 's ] success . " " Knock Me Down " is notable for featuring an appearance by actor Alex Winter , who would co @-@ direct the video for the band 's third single , " Taste the Pain " . MTV introduced the band 's videos into their daily rotation , highlighting the band as up @-@ and @-@ coming and " one to watch " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Although more commercially successful than the band 's previous albums , Mother 's Milk received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with the excessive distortion found throughout the record . However , it was praised as well ; Amy Hanson of AllMusic called it " a pivotal album for the Red Hot Chili Peppers , " and believed that " if anyone doubted the pulsating power that leapt from the blistering opener , ' Good Time Boys ' , it took only a few bars of the Red Hot Chili Peppers ' outrageous , and brilliant , interpretation of the Stevie Wonder classic ' Higher Ground ' to prove that this new lineup was onto something special . Wrapping up with the aptly titled and truly punked @-@ out ' Punk Rock Classic ' and the band 's own punched @-@ up tribute to ' Magic Johnson ' , Mother 's Milk was everything the band had hoped for , and a little more besides . " Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called it a " high @-@ octane fusion of metal , funk and rap — sort of Prince meets Jimi Hendrix in the Twilight Zone , " while noting that " Knock Me Down " combined " electrifying musicianship " . The Toronto Star commented that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were " the Mothers of Invention for the 1990s . " In 2005 , Mother 's Milk was ranked number 359 in Rock Hard magazine 's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time . 
 While Carly Darlin of The Orange County Register found the record to be " an energetic and fun restatement of the RHCP whiplash funk attitude " , she believed that " with the exception of the dreamy instrumental ' Pretty Little <unk> ' , it doesn 't break any new ground . " She continued by saying that , if anything " Mother 's Milk is a slight step away from the party @-@ funk grooves of the last two albums and a return to the band 's punk @-@ rock roots . They even reprise the cover of Jimi Hendrix 's ' Fire ' , which they did as a B @-@ side for their ' Fight Like A Brave ' 12 @-@ inch two years ago . " Furthermore , Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post said " the polite term for albums like ' Milk ' is ' eclectic ' , but it really sounds as if the band is unraveling [ ... ] Considering the circumstances , it 's not especially surprising that the album seems to be looking for someone to give it directions . " However , Jenkins did believe Frusciante possessed " solid metal chops and means to show them off . " Music critic Robert Christgau , who gave the record a rating of C + , mocked the band 's ability to promote empathy and found the guitar layering in Mother 's Milk to have been done improperly : " punks who loved Hendrix and P @-@ Funk way way back , they 're finally cashing in on their good taste , and though unbelievers dis their sincerity , execution 's the problem . They didn 't have the chops to bring it off then , and by pushing the guitar up front they sound even cruder now . But they 're perfectly nice fellas , really — mention ' compassion ' in the very first verse . " The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three stars out of five .

 Released on August 16 , 1989 , Mother 's Milk peaked at number 52 on the U.S. Billboard 200 The record failed to chart in the United Kingdom and Europe , but climbed to number 33 in Australia . " Knock Me Down " reached number six on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks whereas " Higher Ground " charted at number eleven ; the latter of the two ultimately proved to be more successful , however , by influencing foreign charts at number fifty @-@ four in the UK and forty @-@ five in Australia and France . While " Taste the Pain " did not chart in the U.S. , the single reached number twenty @-@ six in the UK — the group 's first Top 40 single in the region . The success the Red Hot Chili Peppers achieved with Mother 's Milk was something the group had been working towards since the release of their debut album ; Apter notes , " After five hard years , several departures , <unk> and one tragic death , the Peppers were now much more than a hometown sensation . " The band had played numerous concerts before the album 's release and aired new songs weekly to generate interest in it . Mother 's Milk was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in late March 1990 — it is now certified platinum — and was the first Chili Peppers album to ship in excess of 500 @,@ 000 units . In 2003 the album was re @-@ released through EMI ; all tracks were completely remastered and an additional six songs were included as well as hand written liner notes from Flea .

 Mother 's Milk instantly garnered more attention than the band 's previous records and , as such , the venues the band performed in were able to accommodate far larger crowds . For the first time the band also upgraded to a full @-@ fledged tour bus and added backup musicians and singers . Longtime friend , Keith " Tree " Barry was added to play horns and backup singers Kristen Vigard and Vicki Calhoun ( who appeared in the video for " Knock Me Down " ) also joined the tour . When the band hit England , roadie Robbie Allen ( nicknamed Rob Rule ) would open for the band providing a comedy performance in which he would pretend to cut off his own penis . Allen would later become one of the band 's backup singers on the One Hot Minute tour . The album 's official launch , however , was held in New York City at a club called Tramps ; following this , Red Hot Chili Peppers embarked on an introductory European tour which included a free show in Amsterdam 's Dam Square that attracted over 10 @,@ 000 attendees . On September 8 , 1989 the band commenced their North American leg in Seattle . The leg saw an overwhelmingly positive response from critics across the country ; following a concert in Portland , journalist John Foyston of The Oregonian noted the " Hollywood @-@ based quartet fomented an audience reaction that had to be seen to be believed . The stage @-@ divers started rushing the stage from the moment the band walked on . Once on stage , it was an issue of luck and chutzpah . " Todd <unk> of the Colorado Springs newspaper The Gazette said the Chili Peppers ' performance at the Colorado Indoor Sports Complex was " the kind of place where kids could be kids , and no one cared if soft drinks stuck to the floor and the rafters shook with a stunning barrage of decibels . People in the audience , steeped in sweat and pressing against the barricade in front of the stage , threw their arms up in unison and barked out approval of one fast , furiously @-@ played song after another . " 
 By the end of the leg , the band members were having trouble adjusting to their newfound fame as virtually every concert on the tour was sold out and Mother 's Milk approached 500 @,@ 000 units sold . Spin reported that following a show in Atlanta , Flea invited a woman to his hotel room for sexual intercourse , but locked himself in the bathroom upon arriving because all he could think of were his wife and daughter . Kiedis ended a two @-@ year long relationship with actress Ione Skye , and Frusciante , looking back on the tour years later , admitted , " I was totally abusing the situation [ ... ] partying and screwing a bunch of girls . At 19 , I might have looked like a stud but I was a weakling inside . I wasn 't proud of who I was then . " Shortly before the end of the North American leg , the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena , which was released as Psychedelic <unk> Live from Heaven in 1990 . A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year 's Eve 1989 attracted over 10 @,@ 000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony <unk> to be " the biggest [ concert ] I had seen them play at that point . It gave me a handle on how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this . " The tour continued in the United Kingdom , where the band was receiving less attention ; Kiedis complained after several shows there , " We 're huge in the States and it 's sort of frustrating and confusing that no one knows who we are here . " It was not until after their return from the UK that " Taste the Pain " was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty @-@ nine there . In March 1990 , the band was asked to perform on MTV 's coverage of Spring break in Florida . At the event , Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage ; the situation got out of hand , and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member . They were arrested several days later on charges of battery , disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act , but released on $ 2 @,@ 000 bail . Smith and Flea 's arrest worsened Kiedis ' impending charge in Virginia from the " Positive Mental Octopus " tour , for which the vocalist was ultimately convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure and sentenced to pay a fine of $ 1 @,@ 000 per charge . 
 The Chili Peppers wound up the Mother 's Milk tour with a variety of performances that included the 1990 Pinkpop Festival and several other large @-@ scale concerts . Once complete , the band rested , and Frusciante and Flea organized a short @-@ lived side project called H.A.T.E. along with bassist John Norwood Fisher and vocalist Angelo Moore of Fishbone . EMI capitalized on the recent interest in the Chili Peppers by releasing a music video compilation VHS called Positive Mental Octopus , which was named after the tour , in 1990 . That same year the band also released " Show Me Your Soul " , a song that was originally a b @-@ side on the " Knock Me Down " single , on the soundtrack to the hit romantic comedy film , Pretty Woman . The song was a minor hit for the band and a music video was made . For unknown reasons the band also recorded a cover of the Bachman – Turner Overdrive song , " Takin ' Care of Business , " however the song would never be released .

 Chad Smith made the announcement on January 29 , 2014 that EMI was planning to release a 25th anniversary version of the album sometime in 2014 . Smith said some " extra stuff " would be included on the release although it is unknown if the extra material will be unreleased songs or the bonus tracks released on the previously remastered version of the album . In an August 2014 interview with Rolling Stone , Smith discussed the anniversary and legacy of the album saying that a remastered version was still in the works and that he gave the ok to include a live show recorded in Cleveland , OH that likely will be a bonus disc however he thinks that all of the outtakes from the record have already been released although there might be a few things that the band left unfinished that could be released . As of 2016 , EMI has yet to re @-@ release the album .

 = Titchwell Marsh = 
 Titchwell Marsh is an English nature reserve owned and managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) . Located on the north coast of the county of Norfolk between the villages of Titchwell and Thornham , about 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) east of the seaside resort of Hunstanton , its 171 hectares ( 420 acres ) include reed beds , salt marshes , a freshwater lagoon and a sandy beach , with a small area of woodland near the car park . 
 The reserve is important for some scarce breeding birds , such as pied avocets on the islands , and western marsh harriers , Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds . To encourage bitterns to breed , the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter , and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd . Typical wetland birds such as the water rail , reed warbler and sedge warbler also appear , and little egrets are common . The reserve has regularly attracted rarities , as its location is important for migrating birds . Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers , and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole . 
 Facilities include three bird hides , a seawatching platform , two nature trails , and a visitor centre . Because of concerns about climate change , a major project in 2010 and 2011 brought improvements to the banks around the freshwater lagoon and the conversion of the brackish lagoon to tidal saltmarsh , a more effective barrier to encroachment by the sea . 
 Titchwell Marsh is archaeologically significant , with artefacts dating back to the Upper Paleolithic , and has remains of military constructions from both world wars . These include brickwork from a First World War military hospital and 1940s artillery targets for armoured fighting vehicles and warplanes . This internationally important reserve is part of the North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) and the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) , and is also protected through Natura 2000 , Special Protection Area ( SPA ) and Ramsar listings . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = To 1972 = = = 
 Titchwell has a long history of human occupation . Populations of both Modern and Neanderthal people were present in Norfolk before the last glaciation between 100 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago , and returned as the ice retreated north . The archaeological record is poor until about 20 @,@ 000 years ago , partly due to the prevailing conditions , but also because the coastline was much further north than at present , so that many sites are now under the sea . Early Mesolithic flint tools with characteristic blades up to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) long found on the present @-@ day coast at Titchwell date from a time when it was 60 – 70 km ( 37 – 43 mi ) from the sea . Other flint tools have been found dating from the Upper Paleolithic to the Neolithic . As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic , the sea level rose , filling what is now the North Sea , and bringing the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line ; the remains of submerged forests can still be detected at low tide . By 11 @,@ 000 BC , the makers of the long blades had gone , and peat marshes had formed behind an offshore barrier <unk> spit . A layer of peat formed between 1920 and 1680 BC and another between 1020 and 830 BC , indicating marshy conditions ; polished Neolithic axes found in those layers were blackened by exposure to the peat . 
 Two possible timber platforms were identified within the peat at Titchwell , and may be prehistoric . Similar Bronze Age structures are rare , and they may be significant in providing information about early timber construction methods . Medieval and later pottery has been found at Titchwell , and the peat and silts which overlay the sediments deposited by the retreating glaciers have signs of post @-@ medieval ploughing . 
 The draining of Norfolk 's coastal marshes commenced in the late 17th and 18th centuries , and sea defences including the " Old Lord 's Bank " at Titchwell were shown in maps from 1786 and 1797 . For the next 170 years or so , the reclaimed marsh was arable , producing crops and beef cattle . A huge influx of Pallas 's sandgrouse into Britain in 1853 led to several arrivals at Titchwell , including mated pairs . The last bird seen was on the saltmarsh , and the rest were on the dunes or in marram grass ; many were shot . 
 Thornham Marsh , immediately west of Titchwell , was used between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a bombing range . Some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period . A First World War concrete building along the west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942 . 
 During the Second World War , military defences were constructed at Titchwell . The drainage of farmland behind the banks was stopped , <unk> the former marshland ; zigzag ditches were dug , and pillboxes built into Old Lord 's Bank . Between 1942 and 1945 , the marsh was used by the Royal Tank Regiment ; an armoured fighting vehicle gunnery range was established and new banks were constructed for firing practice , with targets set at 900 m ( 980 yd ) intervals . Some of the still extant islands were built to hold " pop @-@ up " targets , operated by cables from winches in a building whose foundations lie below Island Hide . Remains of the triangular concrete track used by the tanks also survive . Military activities continued after the war , with the Royal Air Force returning to Thornham Marsh between 1950 and 1959 . Bombing practice was supervised from a control tower , which was demolished in 1962 , leaving only a concrete structure opposite the end of Titchwell 's west bank . The remains of two Second World War Covenanter tanks , probably used as targets , are sometimes exposed at low tide . 
 The wreck of the SS Vina , a cargo steamer built in 1894 , can be seen at low tide . In 1944 , she was anchored offshore for use as an RAF target when a gale dragged her to her present location and sank her . After the war , some of the wreck was salvaged as scrap . The remains of the Vina are accessible at low tide , but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide . A warning sign on the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately . 
 Behind the sea wall , the marshes were drained after the war , and reverted to farmland , but the bank was breached in the North Sea flood of 1953 , returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea aster . The construction of a new sea wall across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon , with a reed bed on its northern side and a vegetation @-@ free brackish marsh . 
 = = = RSPB era = = = 
 Between 1970 and 1972 , a pair of Montagu 's harriers , Britain 's rarest breeding birds of prey , nested in the reed bed . The RSPB bought the reserve in 1973 for £ 53 @,@ 000 ( £ 578 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . The Montagu 's harriers did not return , but marsh harriers did , and the RSPB commenced improving the habitat and facilities , including embanking the lagoons and building a car park and visitor centre . <unk> , then still very rare in the UK , first bred here in 1984 . The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 to cope with the numbers of visitors . 
 In 1991 , the sea broke through the dunes at the eastern end of the beach near the former Tern Hide , and the dunes started to erode . The remains of the Second World War tanks first appeared around this time . In the following year the boardwalk at the beach end of the west bank was constructed to protect the dunes , and the seawatching platform was added at its northern end . 12 hectares ( 30 acres ) of land to the east of the reserve was bought in 1993 ; much of this was formerly part of the firing range , and large amounts of barbed wire caused problems when the area was being converted to reed bed and wet grazing meadow . Over the winter , an old hide on the West Bank was demolished and replaced with the current Island Hide . Storms in February 1996 removed most of the dunes east of the boardwalk , and eroded those to the west . The Tern Hide , now cut off at high tide , was dismantled . Developments at the end of the 20th century included the 1997 extension of the visitor centre , which included building a cafe , and the erection of Fen Hide in 1999 , together with a boardwalk path to the hide , and a dragonfly pond . 
 The reserve covers 171 hectares ( 420 acres ) , and is of international importance for its breeding and wintering birds . It was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) in 1973 , and in 1986 it was subsumed into the 7 @,@ 700 hectares ( 19 @,@ 000 acres ) North Norfolk Coast SSSI . The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000 , Special Protection Area ( SPA ) and Ramsar listings , and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) . This is the RSPB 's most visited reserve , with about 92 @,@ 000 visitors annually . 
 = = Access and facilities = = 
 Titchwell Marsh is next to the A149 road and buses stop outside the reserve . The main track to the beach is a public right @-@ of @-@ way , and the only part of the reserve where dogs are permitted . The reserve is open all year , and access is free , although non @-@ members are charged for using the car park . The main part of the reserve is accessed from the visitor centre using the 1 km ( 1 @,@ 050 yd ) West Bank footpath . After leaving the woodland around the visitor centre , there are two short paths running from the main path ; the 200 m ( 220 yd ) Fen Trail to a hide overlooking the reed bed , and the 100 m ( 110 yd ) Meadow Trail boardwalk loop through wet marsh and past the dragonfly pond . The main footpath continues north past the reedbed to the freshwater lagoon and the Island Hide , then reaches a bank running across the reserve . The new Parrinder hides are placed along this wall . The footpath continues past a tidal lagoon , and over another bank to a saltmarsh , formerly ending at a raised wooden seawatching platform on the dunes by the beach . 
 The visitor centre and shop are open daily except Christmas Day and Boxing Day . Most of the reserve and its facilities are wheelchair accessible , but the last part of the path to the beach is rough , and accessed via a steep bank . 
 = = Fauna and flora = = 
 = = = Birds = = = 
 The key breeding species are reed bed specialists such as the marsh harrier , Eurasian bittern and bearded <unk> , together with the avocet , the RSPB 's symbolic bird . Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat and a lack of sufficient large food fish ; although European eels , a favoured food , are present , the numbers are too low . These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed bed to create open , reed @-@ fringed pools , and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd ; breeding recommenced in 2004 . In 2011 , there were 80 avocet nests , two pairs of Eurasian bitterns , and four pairs of marsh harriers , the latter successfully fledging seven young . 
 Other breeding birds include ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers in the sand dunes , and water rails in the reed bed . Sedge , reed and Cetti 's warblers all nest in the wetland , and little egrets are now common on the reserve . In early summer , scarcer migrants like the little gull , black tern , Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through on their way to breed elsewhere . 
 In the autumn , species arrive from the north , some , such as black @-@ tailed godwits , curlew sandpipers and little stints just passing through , pausing for a few days to refuel , others staying for the winter . This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings . Offshore , great and Arctic skuas , northern gannets and black @-@ legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds . 
 Large numbers of ducks winter on the reserve , including many Eurasian wigeons , Eurasian teals , mallards and gadwalls , and smaller counts of goldeneyes and northern pintails . Offshore , there may be large " rafts " of common scoters , and smaller numbers of common eiders , long @-@ tailed ducks , velvet scoters and red @-@ throated divers . Brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae , and hundreds of European golden plovers may roost on the reserve at high tide . In the evenings , large flocks of pink @-@ footed geese fly over Titchwell on their way to roost , and barn owls and hen harriers quarter the marshes . This is the season for flocks of lesser <unk> , sometimes accompanied by a rarer common redpoll , and snow buntings are to be found on the beach . 
 The reserve 's location means that migrants may be found , sometimes in huge numbers when the weather conditions are right . These may include vagrant rarities . A black @-@ winged stilt , which acquired the nickname " Sammy " , arrived in 1993 and became a permanent resident up to its disappearance in 2005 . Other rarities in recent years include a Baird 's sandpiper , a broad @-@ billed sandpiper , a thrush nightingale and an Arctic redpoll , all in 2004 , a stilt sandpiper in 2005 , and a black @-@ winged pratincole and a black @-@ headed wagtail in 2009 . 
 = = = Other animals and plants = = = 
 Water voles are a highly threatened species in the UK , with a huge decline in numbers , mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink . They are still common at Titchwell , which is one of a number of East Anglian sites now of national importance for this species . Both common and grey seals can be seen off the beach . Other vertebrates include European eels , common toads and three @-@ spined sticklebacks . 
 In summer , the dragonfly pond can hold up to ten species of dragonflies and damselflies . The nationally scarce moth flame wainscot has bred at Titchwell since 1996 ; other Lepidoptera may include migrants such as the painted lady , the diamondback moth , and especially the silver Y , which can occur in huge numbers ; 90 @,@ 000 were recorded on the reserve in July 2010 , feeding on sea lavender . 
 The saltmarsh contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions , with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established : first sea aster , then mainly sea lavender , with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants . The drier areas contain maritime grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass . The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush , brackish water crowfoot , sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 As the RSPB 's busiest reserve , Titchwell Marsh has a significant economic impact on its locality . A 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137 @,@ 700 visitors spent £ 1 @.@ 8 million locally in 1998 . The tiny village of Titchwell has two three @-@ star hotels and a shop selling telescopes and binoculars , although it does not have a general store or a public house . 
 A 2005 survey at Titchwell and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit . The 7 @.@ 7 million day visitors and 5 @.@ 5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £ 122 million , and created the equivalent of 2 @,@ 325 full @-@ time jobs . 
 = = Threats = = 
 The soft rocks of the North Norfolk coast have been attacked by the sea for centuries ; at Titchwell Marsh , the beach and sand dunes protecting the northern edge of the reserve have been eroded , and climate change has increased the likelihood of damage to the freshwater areas of the reserve . The predicted increasingly stormy weather could damage the dune system and expose the soft earth banks to wave damage , or the sea could just over @-@ top the defences , as it had done in the 1953 floods . Either way , the conservation value of the reserve would be adversely affected , especially through the potential loss of the bitterns . Rather than reinforce the outer bank , it was decided to undertake a managed realignment . Between 2010 and 2011 , the banks on the east and west of the reserve were reinforced , and the sea wall to the north of the fresh marsh was rebuilt on the line of the old Parrinder bank . The old Parrinder Hide was replaced by a pair of modern hides , retaining the original name . Designed by <unk> , these hides won an award from RIBA for their architectural style . The former brackish marsh north of the new wall has been modified by creating a breach in the east bank . This will allow tidal flooding and the eventual establishment of saltmarsh on what is now named Volunteer Marsh . The new saltmarsh will protect the rebuilt Parrinder wall , slowing erosion . Nevertheless , it is estimated that by 2060 the beach may have advanced halfway across the new tidal area . Other improvements were made to the reed beds and islands in the freshwater lagoon , and a new sluice was installed . New reedbeds were created east of Fen Hide , which can be accessed by trails opened in 2012 . The first part of the trail is open all year , but the " autumn trail " , running up from the woodland in the southeastern corner of the reserve , is accessible only from August to October . 
 = Fort Senneville = 
 Fort Senneville is one of the outlying forts of Montreal , Quebec , Canada , built by the Canadiens of New France near the Sainte @-@ Anne rapids in 1671 . The property was part of a fief ceded to <unk> de <unk> in 1672 by the <unk> . A large stone windmill , which doubled as a watch tower , was built on a hill by late 1686 and featuring machicolation and other castle @-@ like features . The fort was burned down by Iroquois in 1691 , with only the mill itself left standing . 
 Governor @-@ General Frontenac ordered the construction of a second , more imposing fort in 1692 . It was rebuilt in 1702 @-@ 1703 to protect the nearby fur trading post . With extensive cannons and swiveling wall guns , it was the " most substantial castle @-@ like fort " near Montreal . It was eventually destroyed in 1776 by Benedict Arnold , under American military control , but the ruins have been maintained since then . In 2003 , it was classified as a historic site . 
 = = Background = = 
 Thanks to the tireless work of French explorers , the colony of New France covered the largest area , but it was numerically inferior to the neighbouring New England . Consequently , a number of <unk> du Roi ( " King 's Engineers " ) were appointed to make the colony the best fortified in North America : 
 Quebec served as the only fortified city in the Americas , centred on the Citadelle of Quebec . An unusual feature of Montreal 's defence was a string of 30 outlying forts to protect against the constant Iroquois threat to the expansion of French settlements . The majority of these were simple stockades , but as artillery was not as developed as on the battlefields of Europe , some of these were built like the fortified manor houses of France . Roughly four of these were substantial stone forts which served as defensive residences , sometimes considered " true castles " , as well as imposing structures to prevent Iroquois incursions . Initially , Fort Senneville was a French stockaded fort , built in 1671 about half a mile above the Sainte @-@ Anne rapids . The property was part of a fief ceded to <unk> de <unk> in 1672 by the Society of Saint @-@ Sulpice , and subsequently relinquished in payment of a debt to two of the most significant figures in New France 's history : Jacques Le Ber and Charles Le Moyne , who used the site as a fur @-@ trading post . 
 A large stone windmill was built on a hill by late 1686 , doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River , the Lake of Two Mountains and the mouth of the Des Prairies River . This windmill was like no other in New France ( although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec ) , with thick walls , square loopholes for muskets , with machicolation at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers . 
 In October 1687 , the nearby Fort Sainte @-@ Anne and the Senneville mill were attacked by Iroquois , and although several settlers were killed , the attackers were repulsed . A second attack was more successful in 1691 , and the fort was burned down . Only the mill itself was left standing . 
 = = Second fort = = 
 The attack had come shortly after the 1690 Battle of Quebec , and an enraged Governor @-@ General Frontenac ordered the construction of a second , more imposing fort . The fort was rebuilt in 1692 with thick stone walls and corner tower bastions . With extensive cannons and swivel wall guns , it was the " most substantial castle @-@ like fort " near Montreal . 
 It was never attacked again . The windmill was rebuilt in 1700 , and was probably still in use until the 1780s . In 1703 , Jacques Le Ber de Senneville constructed a large stone house and fort in order to improve and protect his fur trading operations , and the local <unk> manor house was built in 1706 . However , after the fall of New France in 1763 , it was not used by the British as a military post . In 1776 , Fort Senneville was destroyed during the American Revolutionary War by Continental Army troops under Benedict Arnold , in military manoeuvres associated with the Battle of the Cedars . 
 In 1865 , the property was purchased as a summer residence by John Joseph Caldwell Abbott , former prime minister of Canada and Mayor of Montreal . Sir Edward Seaborne Clouston purchased the domain from Abbott 's estate in 1898 . 
 = = The site today = = 
 The site remains private property . The 10 @-@ acre ( 4 ha ) area today is important part to Montreal 's cultural and natural heritage for several reasons . 
 In November 2003 , Quebec recognized its historical significance by classifying it a " Site historique " . The Ministry of Culture and Communications has commissioned studies on the historical ownership of the fort , and funded archaeological research and repairs to consolidate the structure of the ruin , recognising " the exceptional historic and prehistoric archaeological potential of the ruin and its surroundings " . 
 The site 's value today includes its ecological and environmental significance , and its shoreline , which is in a semi @-@ natural state , is part of the habitat for the rare map turtle . It is situated between the Lake of Two Mountains and the Senneville Forest <unk> , as described in Montreal 's Natural Spaces Policy . Therefore , it could be considered part of the wildlife corridor ( lien <unk> ) between the lake and the forest . 
 = Augmentative and alternative communication = 
 Augmentative and alternative communication ( AAC ) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language . AAC is used by those with a wide range of speech and language impairments , including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy , intellectual impairment and autism , and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson 's disease . AAC can be a permanent addition to a person 's communication or a temporary aid . 
 Modern use of AAC began in the 1950s with systems for those who had lost the ability to speak following surgical procedures . During the 1960s and 1970s , spurred by an increasing commitment in the West towards the inclusion of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing the skills required for independence , the use of manual sign language and then graphic symbol communication grew greatly . It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right . Rapid progress in technology , including microcomputers and speech synthesis , have paved the way for communication devices with speech output and multiple options for access to communication for those with physical disabilities . 
 AAC systems are diverse : unaided communication uses no equipment and includes signing and body language , while aided approaches use external tools . Aided communication methods can range from paper and pencil to communication books or boards to devices that produce voice output ( speech generating devices or SGD 's ) and / or written output . The symbols used in AAC include gestures , photographs , pictures , line drawings , letters and words , which can be used alone or in combination . Body parts , pointers , adapted mice , or eye tracking can be used to select target symbols directly , and switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection . Message generation is generally much slower than spoken communication , and as a result rate enhancement techniques may be used to reduce the number of selections required . These techniques include " prediction " , in which the user is offered guesses of the word / phrase being composed , and " encoding " , in which longer messages are retrieved using a <unk> code . 
 The evaluation of a user 's abilities and requirements for AAC will include the individual 's motor , visual , cognitive , language and communication strengths and weaknesses . The evaluation requires the input of family members , particularly for early intervention . Respecting ethnicity and family beliefs are key to a family @-@ centered and ethnically competent approach . Studies show that AAC use does not impede the development of speech , and may result in a modest increase in speech production . Users who have grown up with AAC report satisfying relationships and life activities ; however , they may have poor literacy and are unlikely to be in employment . 
 The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines augmentative and alternative communication one of communications as well as display of text , large @-@ print , tactile communication , plain language , accessible multimedia and accessible information and communications technology . 
 = = Scope = = 
 Augmentative and alternative communication is used by individuals to compensate for severe speech @-@ language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language . People making use of AAC include individuals with a variety of congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy , autism , intellectual disability , and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , traumatic brain injury and aphasia . Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age / disabilities surveyed , but typically between 0 @.@ 1 and 1 @.@ 5 % of the population are considered to have such severe speech @-@ language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood , and thus could benefit from AAC . An estimated 0 @.@ 05 % of children and young people require high technology AAC . Well @-@ known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking , broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan . Award @-@ winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean @-@ Dominique Bauby respectively , have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience . 
 The field was originally called " Augmentative Communication " ; the term served to indicate that such communication systems were to supplement natural speech rather than to replace it . The addition of " alternative " followed later , when it became clear that for some individuals non @-@ speech systems were their only means of communication . AAC users typically utilize a variety of aided and unaided communication strategies depending on the communication partners and the context . 
 = = Forms of AAC = = 
 = = = Unaided AAC = = = 
 Unaided AAC systems are those that do not require an external tool , and include facial expression , vocalizations , gestures , and sign languages and systems . Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication , and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities . More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language . For example , the Amer @-@ Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language , and has been used with children with severe @-@ profound disabilities , and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia , aphasia and dysarthria . The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user , usually understood by an educated listener , and are efficient means of communicating . 
 In contrast , sign languages have a linguistic base and permit the expression of an unlimited number of messages . Approaches to signing can be divided into two major categories , those that encode an existing language , and those that are languages in their own right . Signing Exact English may be considered the most widely used example of the former and American Sign Language as a common example of the latter . Signing is used alone or in conjunction with speech to support communication with individuals with a variety of disorders . The specific hand shapes and movements of sign and gesture require an individual to have adequate fine motor and motor planning skills . Sign languages require more fine @-@ motor coordination and are less transparent in meaning than gestural codes such as Amer @-@ Ind ; the latter limits the number of people able to understand the person 's communication without training . 
 = = = Aided AAC = = = 
 An AAC aid is any " device , either electronic or non @-@ electronic , that is used to transmit or receive messages " ; such aids range from communication books to speech generating devices . Since the skills , areas of difficulty and communication needs of AAC users vary greatly , an equally diverse range of communication aids and devices is required . 
 = = = = Low @-@ tech = = = = 
 Low @-@ tech communication aids are defined as those that do not need batteries , electricity or electronics . These are often very simple communication boards or books , from which the user selects letters , words , phrases , pictures , and / or symbols to communicate a message . Depending on physical abilities and limitations , users may indicate the appropriate message with a body part , light pointer , eye @-@ gaze direction , or a head / mouth stick . Alternatively , they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options . 
 = = = = High @-@ tech = = = = 
 High @-@ tech AAC aids permit the storage and retrieval of electronic messages , with most allowing the user to communicate using speech output . Such devices are known as speech generating devices ( SGD ) or voice output communication aids ( VOCA ) . A device 's speech output may be digitized and / or synthesized : digitized systems play recorded words or phrases and are generally more intelligible while synthesized speech uses text @-@ to @-@ speech software that can be harder to understand but that permits the user to spell words and speak novel messages . 
 High @-@ tech systems may be dedicated devices developed solely for AAC , or non @-@ dedicated devices such as computers that run additional software to allow them to function as AAC devices . They may be static or dynamic in form . Static communication devices have symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays , which are changed manually . To increase the vocabulary available , some static devices have multiple levels , with different words appearing on different levels . On dynamic AAC devices , the user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages . 
 High @-@ tech devices vary in the amount of information that they can store , as well as their size , weight and thus their portability . Access methods depend on the abilities of the user , and may include the use of direct selection of symbols on the screen or keyboard with a body part , pointer , adapted mice or joysticks , or indirect selection using switches and scanning . Devices with voice output offer its user the advantage of more communicative power , including the ability to initiate conversation with communication partners who are at a distance . However , they typically require programming , and tend to be unreliable . Because of the latter , low tech systems often recommended as a backup in case of device failure . 
 = = Symbols = = 
 Symbols used on high and low @-@ tech AAC systems include graphic , auditory , gestural and textural symbols to represent objects , actions and concepts . For users with literacy skills , both low and high @-@ tech devices may use alphabet @-@ based symbols including individual letters , whole words , or parts thereof . With low @-@ tech devices , the communication partner must interpret the symbols chosen whereas a high @-@ tech device can speak the created message aloud . Several large graphic symbol sets have been developed ; these include <unk> , which possess linguistic characteristics such as grammatical indicators , and the more iconic Picture Communication Symbols ( PCS ) which do not . Tactile symbols are textured objects , real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and / or significant intellectual impairments . Auditory symbols such as choices of spoken words or Morse code can also be integrated with assistive technology for the visually impaired . 
 The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation , such as size and background , depend on an individual 's preferences as well as their linguistic , visual , and cognitive skills . 
 = = Access and selection methods = = 
 Technological advances have dramatically increased the types of selection methods available for individuals with communication impairments . In " Direct Selection " , the selection is made by pointing to the desired symbol using a finger or an alternative pointer , such as eye gaze , a head stick , head- or eye @-@ controlled mouse . To accommodate motor control difficulties some users use alternative activation strategies ; for example in " timed activation " , the user maintains selection of the symbol for a predetermined period of time until it is recognized by the system . With the " release activation " , the selection of the item is only made when the person releases contact from the display . 
 Direct activation of an AAC system is generally the first choice of access method as it is faster and cognitively easier . Those unable to do so may use indirect selection or " scanning " . In this method , items displayed for selection are scanned ; the scanning may be visual using indicators such as lights , highlighting , and / or contrasting borders , or auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device . When the desired message is reached , the AAC user indicates the choice using an alternative selection technique such as a switch , vocalization or gesture . Several different patterns for switch access scanning are available : in " circular scanning " , the items are displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time . It is often introduced first to children or beginning AAC users because it is the easiest to understand . In " linear scanning " , items are organized in rows and are scanned one at a time until a choice is made . Although more demanding than circular scanning , it is still easy to learn . Finally , in " group @-@ item scanning " , items are grouped and the groups scanned consecutively . Once a particular group is selected , items within the group are scanned . One of the most common group @-@ item strategies is row @-@ column scanning in which each row forms a group . The rows of items are scanned and when a row is selected , the items in the row are scanned one at a time until a message is selected . 
 There are three main selection control techniques in scanning . In " automatic scanning " , the scan proceeds at a pre @-@ determined speed and pattern until the user selects an item . In " inverse scanning " , the switch is held down to advance the scan , and released to choose the desired <unk> . In " step scanning " , the AAC user activates one switch to move the indicator through the items , and another switch to select the item . 
 = = Vocabulary organization = = 
 Vocabulary organization refers to the way pictures , words , phrases , and sentences are displayed on the communication system . In general , the goal is to facilitate efficient and effective communication , especially when the individual 's AAC system contains a large number of symbols . 
 Communication books and devices are often presented in a grid format ; the vocabulary items displayed within them may be organized by spoken word order , frequency of usage or category . In the Fitzgerald Key organization , symbols from different semantic and syntactic classes are organized grammatically in groups from left to right to facilitate sentence construction . Since research has shown that children and adults use a small number of words frequently , in a core @-@ fringe vocabulary organization , the words and messages that are communicated most frequently appear on a " main page " . The fringe vocabulary — words and messages used more rarely and that are specific to an individual — appear on other pages . Symbols may also be organized by category , grouping people , places , feelings , foods , drinks , and action words together . Another form of grid organization groups vocabulary according to specific activities . Each display contains symbols for the people , places , objects , feelings , actions , and other relevant vocabulary items for a specific activity or routine . 
 Visual scene displays are a different method of organizing and presenting symbols . These are depictions of events , people , objects , and related actions in a picture , photograph , or virtual environment representing a situation , place , or specific experience . They are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary that is associated with specific activities or routines . For example , a photo of a child 's room may be included in the child 's AAC system . Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols for communication . Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use . 
 = = Rate enhancement strategies = = 
 Augmentative and alternative communication is typically much slower than speech , with users generally producing 8 – 10 words per minute . Rate enhancement strategies can increase the user 's rate of output to around 12 – 15 words per minute , and as a result enhance the efficiency of communication . There are two main options for increasing the rate of communication : encoding and prediction . 
 Encoding is a technique permitting an AAC user to produce an entire word , sentence or phrase using only one or two activations of their AAC system . In numeric , alpha @-@ numeric , and letter encoding ( also known as abbreviation @-@ expansion ) , words and sentences are coded as sequences of letters and numbers . For example , typing " HH " may retrieve " Hello , how are you ? " . In iconic encoding strategies , such as Semantic compaction , icons ( picture symbols ) are combined in a sequence to produce words or phrases . 
 Prediction is a rate enhancement strategy in which the device attempts to predict the letter , word or phrase being written by the user . The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the full word . Word prediction software may determine the words predicted based on their frequency in language , association with other words , past choices of the user , or grammatical suitability .
