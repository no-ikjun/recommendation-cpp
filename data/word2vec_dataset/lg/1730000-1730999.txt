The younger <unk> prefer to wear red and white <unk> and tie it round their head like a turban . 
 The above dress code is not compulsory , but prohibitions on wearing " indecent clothing " or revealing too much skin are aspects of the UAE to which Dubai 's visitors are expected to conform , and are encoded in Dubai 's criminal law . The UAE has enforced anti @-@ indecency prohibitions in all public places ( aside from <unk> , beaches , clubs , and bars ) .

The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the difficult @-@ to @-@ make documentary , Slaves in Dubai ( 2009 ) . The Dubai government has denied labour injustices and stated that the watchdog 's ( Human Rights Watch ) accusations were ' misguided ' . The filmmaker explained in interviews how it was necessary to go undercover to avoid discovery by the authorities , who impose high fines on reporters attempting to document human rights abuses , including the conditions of construction workers . Towards the end of March 2006 , the government had announced steps to allow construction unions . UAE labour minister Ali al @-@ <unk> said : " Labourers will be allowed to form unions . "

 = = Economy = = 
 One of the world 's fastest growing economies , Dubai 's gross domestic product is projected at USD 107 @.@ 1 billion , with a growth rate of 6 @.@ 1 % in 2014 . Although a number of core elements of Dubai 's trading infrastructure were built on the back of the oil industry , revenues from oil and natural gas account for less than 5 % of the emirate 's revenues . It is estimated that Dubai produces 50 @,@ 000 to 70 @,@ 000 barrels ( 7 @,@ 900 to 11 @,@ 100 m3 ) of oil a day and substantial quantities of gas from offshore fields . The emirate 's share in the UAE 's total gas revenues is about 2 % . Dubai 's oil reserves have diminished significantly and are expected to be exhausted in 20 years . Real estate and construction ( 22 @.@ 6 % ) , trade ( 16 % ) , entrepôt ( 15 % ) and financial services ( 11 % ) are the largest contributors to Dubai 's economy . 
 Dubai ’ s non @-@ oil foreign trade stood at $ 362 billion in 2014 . Of the overall trade volumes , imports had the biggest share with a value of $ 230 billion while exports and re @-@ exports to the emirate stood at $ 31 billion and $ 101 billion respectively .

 Historically , Dubai and its twin across Dubai Creek , Deira ( independent of Dubai City at that time ) , were important ports of call for Western manufacturers . Most of the new city 's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area . Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s . Dubai has a free trade in gold and , until the 1990s , was the hub of a " brisk smuggling trade " of gold ingots to India , where gold import was restricted . Dubai 's Jebel Ali port , constructed in the 1970s , has the largest man @-@ made harbour in the world and was ranked seventh globally for the volume of container traffic it supports .

 The government 's decision to diversify from a trade @-@ based , oil @-@ reliant economy to one that is <unk> and tourism @-@ oriented made property more valuable , resulting in the property appreciation from 2004 to 2006 . A longer @-@ term assessment of Dubai 's property market , however , showed depreciation ; some properties lost as much as 64 % of their value from 2001 to November 2008 . The large @-@ scale real estate development projects have led to the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest projects in the world such as the Emirates Towers , the Burj Khalifa , the Palm Islands and the most expensive hotel , the Burj Al Arab . Dubai 's property market experienced a major downturn in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the slowing economic climate . By early 2009 , the situation had worsened with the Great Recession taking a heavy toll on property values , construction and employment . This has had a major impact on property investors in the region , some of whom were unable to release funds from investments made in property developments . As of February 2009 , Dubai 's foreign debt was estimated at approximately $ 80 billion , although this is a tiny fraction of the sovereign debt worldwide . Dubai real estate and UAE property experts believe that by avoiding the mistakes of the past , Dubai 's realty market can achieve stability in the future .

Dubai is also known for the traditional souk districts located on either side of its creek . Traditionally , dhows from East Asia , China , Sri Lanka , and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks . Dubai Creek played a vital role in sustaining the life of the community in the city and was the resource which originally drove the economic boom in Dubai . As of September 2013 , Dubai creek has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Many boutiques and jewellery stores are also found in the city . Dubai is also referred to as " the City of Gold " as the Gold Souk in Deira houses nearly 250 gold retail shops .

 Dubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various architectural styles .

 = Marija Bursać = 
 Marija Bursać ( Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> ; 2 August 1920 – 23 September 1943 ) was a Bosnian Serb member of the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II in Yugoslavia and the first woman proclaimed a People 's Hero of Yugoslavia . Bursać was born to a farming family in the village of Kamenica , near Drvar . After the invasion of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers and their creation of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941 , Bursać supported the Partisan resistance movement led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia ( KPJ ) . Like other women in her village , she collected food , clothing , and other supplies for the Partisan war effort . Bursać became a member of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia in September 1941 . The following August she was appointed political commissar of a company of the 1st Krajina Agricultural Shock Brigade , which harvested crops in the <unk> River valley , and was admitted to the KPJ at the end of that summer . 
 Bursać became a Partisan in February 1943 , joining the newly formed 10th Krajina Brigade . With the brigade , she fought in the Grahovo , Knin , Vrlika and Livno areas and served as a nurse . In September 1943 , Bursać was wounded in the leg while throwing hand grenades during an attack on the German base at Prkosi in northwestern Bosnia . As she was being transported to a field hospital at Vidovo Selo , she sang Partisan songs . Bursać 's wound soon developed gangrene , and she died at the hospital on 23 September 1943 . She was proclaimed a People 's Hero of Yugoslavia the following month . Schools , streets and organisations were named in her memory following the war , commemorating her service to the Partisan cause . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bursać was born on 2 August 1920 in the village of Kamenica , near Drvar in the region of Bosanska Krajina , the north @-@ western sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( then part of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes , renamed as Yugoslavia in 1929 ) . The Drvar area was inhabited primarily by ethnic Serbs , with Bosnian Muslims and Croats forming less than four percent of the population . Bursać was the oldest of five children of stonemason Nikola Bursać and his wife , <unk> , who mostly raised sheep and cattle on their family farm . Like other village girls , Bursać did not go to school — only the boys attended elementary school in Drvar . A shepherdess until age fourteen , she later helped her mother with housekeeping and agricultural work . Bursać became skilled at weaving , spinning , knitting and embroidery before completing a six @-@ month tailoring course in Drvar . 
 In 1938 , an elementary school opened in Kamenica at which Velimir Stojnić was a trainee teacher . Stojnić , a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Komunistička partija Jugoslavije or KPJ , outlawed since 1921 ) , organised a public library , reading and sports clubs and a cultural @-@ artistic group . He established a secret KPJ cell in Kamenica in 1939 , the first communist organisation in the area . His ideological convictions earned him a following among the village youth , including Marija 's brother Dušan . The authorities soon became aware of Stojnić 's activities , and he was removed from Kamenica in February 1940 . 
 = = World War II = = 
 On 6 April 1941 Yugoslavia was invaded from all sides by the Axis powers , led by Nazi Germany . The Royal Yugoslav Army ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije or VKJ ) capitulated on 17 April , and the Germans , Italians and Hungarians dismembered the country . A fascist puppet state , the Independent State of Croatia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska or NDH , including almost all of modern @-@ day Croatia , all of modern @-@ day Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina and parts of modern @-@ day Serbia ) was proclaimed on 10 April . The NDH was an " Italian @-@ German quasi @-@ protectorate " , controlled by the Croatian nationalist Ustaše movement under Ante Pavelić . One of the NDH 's policies was to eliminate the state 's ethnic Serb population with mass killings , expulsions and forced assimilation . The first Drvar Serbs were killed on 18 June 1941 . The atrocities accelerated the formation of two large resistance movements in occupied Yugoslavia . Royalists and Serbian nationalists led by VKJ Colonel Draža Mihailović founded the Ravna Gora Movement , whose members were known as Chetniks . The KPJ , led by Josip Broz Tito , decided in Belgrade on 4 July to launch a nationwide armed uprising and the members of the KPJ @-@ led forces became known as Partisans . 
 = = = Pro @-@ Partisan activity = = = 
 Between 20 and 26 July 1941 local KPJ leaders organised three Partisan detachments , armed with about 200 rifles and seven light machine guns , in the immediate vicinity of Drvar ; one was the Kamenica Detachment . Men from Kamenica had previously established a camp in a nearby forest for weapons and supplies . Bursać was one of the village 's most active women , collecting food and clothing for the insurgents and serving as a courier for the Kamenica camp . On 27 July the Partisans liberated Drvar , beginning the uprising in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina . Over the next few days , other parts of Bosanska Krajina were also liberated , although at this stage the KPJ had little control of the Serb villagers who took up arms . The liberated area around Drvar and Grahovo , under constant attack by the Ustaše , was defended by the Partisans from their surrounding positions . Bursać and other women from Kamenica joined <unk> <unk> ( the Funds Committee ) , collecting food , clothing and other supplies for the Partisans , and she made clothes for them from wool and cloth . She joined the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Savez komunističke omladine Jugoslavije , or SKOJ ) in September 1941 . 
 On 25 September 1941 Italian troops captured Drvar and Grahovo , but the Partisans retained control of most of the area 's villages . By the end of 1941 , SKOJ 's Kamenica branch had 23 members ; the men served in Partisan units and the women , including Bursać , joined labour companies to support the war effort . A literacy course was organised for female members , which Bursać attended . Some villagers gave agricultural products such as milk , cream and eggs to the Italians , receiving salt , kerosene and rice in return . This practice was strongly condemned by the KPJ , which gathered people from several villages in the hall of the Kamenica school in January 1942 to dissuade them from trading with the enemy . After several KPJ members spoke , Bursać began her speech , but was interrupted by disparaging comments and threats from a young man in the audience . At that moment , a group of men stormed into the hall with wooden poles and pitchforks . In the ensuing chaos Bursać shouted , " You can do nothing to us , you will not hinder us ! " as the other women fled through the windows . In early 1942 she joined the village committee of the Women 's Anti @-@ Fascist Front ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> front <unk> or <unk> ) , a major KPJ @-@ affiliated women 's organisation . 
 On 13 June 1942 Drvar was retaken by the Partisans , with Bursać 's labour company clearing rubble and repairing houses in the town . The company also helped in working the land of families whose men were away fighting with the Partisans . In July , Partisan units composed of fighters from Serbia and Montenegro came to Drvar , and Bursać helped carry their wounded to field hospitals in the mountains . She was one of the most active members of Kamenica 's SKOJ organisation , which sometimes met at her house . The Partisan @-@ held territory around Drvar expanded significantly , and included the <unk> River valley in late July 1942 . The valley 's primarily non @-@ Serb population had fled before the advancing Partisans , whom they feared because of Ustaše propaganda . The Partisan command engaged young people from western Bosanska Krajina to harvest wheat and other crops from the valley , transporting them to storage facilities on Mount Grmeč . The workers ( mostly young women ) were organised into military @-@ style units , which were merged in mid @-@ August into the four @-@ battalion 1st Krajina Agricultural Shock Brigade . Bursać was appointed political commissar of the 3rd Company of the brigade 's 2nd Battalion . Guarded by Partisan units , the brigade completed its work despite attacks by enemy planes . Bursać was admitted to the KPJ at the end of summer 1942 ; at the beginning of 1943 , she was president of the village committee of the United Federation of Anti @-@ Fascist Youth of Yugoslavia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> savez <unk> omladine Jugoslavije , or <unk> ) . 
 = = = Yugoslav Partisan = = = 
 Tito came to Drvar at the end of January 1943 , during a major Axis offensive against the Partisans ( code @-@ named Fall Weiss in German ) . After consulting with Đuro Pucar , the head of the KPJ regional committee for Bosanska Krajina , Tito decided to form a Partisan brigade around a battalion of experienced fighters from Drvar . Additional manpower would consist of recovered Partisans who had been wounded or ill , older men not previously in combat units and young male and female volunteers . The four @-@ battalion 10th Krajina Brigade , intended to play a primarily @-@ defensive role at this stage , was established on 4 February 1943 ; its 800 members included about 120 women . Bursać , one of the volunteers , was assigned to the 2nd Battalion and was transferred to the 3rd Battalion 's 3rd Company the following month . Until September 1943 , she fought the Ustaše , Germans , Italians , and anti @-@ communist Chetniks around Grahovo , Knin , Vrlika , Livno and Mount Dinara , was commended for her courage and skill in combat , and served as a nurse . In February and March 1943 , during the Axis offensive , the brigade experienced constant enemy attacks , food shortages , cold , deep snow and outbreaks of typhus . <unk> , Bursać was transferred to the military kitchen at brigade headquarters at the beginning of spring ; after a month , she was returned to her company at her insistence . When she became ill some time later , Bursać was sent home to recover . 
 The Germans had a fortified base , Stützpunkt Podglavica , near Podglavica in the village of Prkosi ( between Vrtoče and Kulen Vakuf ) . The base , with about 500 members of the 373rd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division and an artillery battery , secured the roads from Petrovac to Bihać and Kulen Vakuf . In September 1943 , the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 10th Krajina Brigade and a battalion of the Drvar – Petrovac Partisan Detachment were directed to attack it . Bursać volunteered to throw hand grenades at the pillboxes and machine @-@ gun nests protecting the base . Although her company commander objected because she still appeared ill , Bursać insisted on throwing the grenades . The three Partisan battalions attacked the base from three directions on 18 September at 11 pm . Bursać and her group of grenade throwers destroyed several pillboxes before they came under fire from another . They destroyed the pillbox , but Bursać received a serious leg wound and was carried to a less exposed area . 
 The Partisans overran portions of the base , retreating before daybreak after the arrival of German reinforcements from Vrtoče and Kulen Vakuf . The brigade reportedly captured four howitzers , two mortars , a heavy machine gun , ten light machine guns , five rifles , a mobile radio and 29 enemy soldiers , and Stützpunkt Podglavica reported 31 German soldiers missing after the attack . The Germans described the night attack as eerie , with female Partisans ' shrill shouts of " Forward ! " ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> ! ) . The battle at Prkosi was the first major offensive action by the 10th Krajina Brigade ; in 1944 , they participated in the liberation of Belgrade . 
 After the battle , Bursać and other heavily @-@ wounded Partisans were carried on stretchers to the field hospital in the village of Vidovo Selo , about 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) away over rugged terrain . During the arduous journey ( which took over three days ) , she sang Partisan songs such as : 
 Bursać had lost much blood and her wound developed gangrene , which the field hospital was poorly equipped to treat . She died in Vidovo Selo on 23 September 1943 , and was buried with military honours at Kamenica ; deputy commissar Veljko Ražnatović spoke on behalf of the 10th Krajina Brigade . Bursać 's final eulogy was delivered by her brother Dušan , leader of the SKOJ district committee for Drvar . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Bursać became a People 's Hero of Yugoslavia on 15 October 1943 , the first woman to receive the honour . Her proclamation was published in the October 1943 issue of the Bulletin of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia : 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> и <unk> <unk> Југославије , a на <unk> V <unk> <unk> <unk> Југославије , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> III <unk> X <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> је <unk> <unk> у <unk> <unk> и на <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> за <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> на <unk> <unk> <unk> с . <unk> . 
 " By decision of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia , and at the proposal of the 5th Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia , the Order of the People 's Hero has been conferred on comrade Marija Bursać , a hand @-@ grenade thrower of the 3rd Battalion of the 10th Krajina Brigade . Comrade Marija was an example of heroism in all fights and ultimately gave her life for the freedom of her people charging enemy trenches at the village of Prkosi . " 
 Yugoslav writer Branko Ćopić wrote a poem , Marija na <unk> ( " Marija at Prkosi " ) , about Bursać . Its title , which may also be interpreted as " Marija defiant " , is a play on words . Bursać " entered the triptych of history , legend , and poetry in the Yugoslav lands " , according to author Jelena <unk> . After the war , schools , streets , and organisations in Yugoslavia were named after her ; a Belgrade neighborhood bears her name . A 2013 comic strip , Marija na <unk> , was published in the Serbian daily newspaper <unk> as part of its Odbrana <unk> ( " Defense of Utopia " ) comic @-@ strip project . Graphic artist Lazar <unk> 's strip combines events from Bursać ’ s life with verses of Ćopić 's poem and left @-@ wing visual symbolism .

 Released in February 2009 , Drake 's mixtape So Far Gone proceeded his series of early mixtapes and achieved unexpected critical and commercial success , earning him two Grammy Award @-@ nominations and producing the hit single " Best I Ever Had " . The single reappeared on his debut EP , which was released after a bidding competition among labels and his signing with Universal Motown Records amid support from high @-@ profile hip hop artists such as Kanye West , Jay @-@ Z , and Lil Wayne .

In an interview for MTV , Drake cited Nas and André 3000 as influences for parts of Thank Me Later , stating " Nas was somebody that I used to listen to his raps and never understood how he did it . I always wanted to understand how he painted those pictures and his bar structure . I went back and really studied Nas and André 3000 and then came back with this album " .

 Drake resumed work on the album in October 2009 , following an onstage injury from a July 2009 concert . Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording studios , including Metalworks Studios , <unk> & <unk> , and Cherry Beach Studios in Toronto , Nightbird Studios in West Hollywood , Gee Jam Studios in Portland , Jamaica , The <unk> Hotel Recording Studio and The Hit Factory in Miami , Blast Off Studios and Rock the Mic in New York , Glenwood Studios in Los Angeles , Triangle Sounds Studios in Atlanta , Takeover Studios in Houston , and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu .

 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Thank Me Later has a languorous , ambient production and is characterized by subtle arrangements , obscured keyboards , skittering snare drums , reverbed percussion , sparse beats , moody synthesizers , and minor keys . Lyrically , Thank Me Later has moody , introspective subject matter , and mainly centers around Drake 's introduction to fame and his romances . The Toronto Star describes the content as " about the sorts of doubts , excesses , betrayals and creeping paranoid suspicions that arrive hand @-@ in @-@ hand with celebrity . " Music journalist Greg Kot describes the album as " personal and eccentric , the journal of a flawed , self @-@ doubting regular guy rather than a strutting icon @-@ in @-@ waiting . " 
 The album 's first @-@ half generally discusses fame directly with confessional songs about unrequited love , money , and women , followed by club @-@ oriented and sexual songs . Drake 's lyrics explore feelings of doubt , insecurity , and heartbreak , while exhibiting both emotional and grammatical malapropisms . <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> of The Harvard Crimson characterizes Drake as " self @-@ deprecating , privileged , [ and ] lovesick " . He raps in a nasal voice and sings subtly , with a flow generally in A @-@ B @-@ AB form . Music journalist Jody Rosen observes " emotionally transparent " rapping that eschews the " <unk> " style previously popular in hip hop , finding Drake 's style to be " subtle and rueful rather than loud and lively " . 
 Music writers liken Thank Me Later to Kanye West 's 808s & Heartbreak . Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club writes that , " musically , Drake favors warm washes of synthesizers that create a melancholy , fragile mood redolent of 808s & Heartbreak . " Comparisons are also drawn to Man on the Moon : The End of Day by Kid Cudi , a protégé of West . By contrast , Joshua Ostroff of The Globe and Mail feels that Thank Me Later 's " emotional navel @-@ gazing lacks West ’ s often @-@ suffocating self @-@ pity and offers a proper synthesis of rap and R & B. " Jeff Weiss of the Los Angeles Times views that the album ignores West 's celebratory side " in search of anthems for the easily alienated . " 
 " Fireworks " references the divorce of Drake 's parents and alludes to his brief fling with Rihanna . " Karaoke " features background keyboards that add to the song 's 1980s musical influence , with lyrics about the difficulty of relationships . In " The Resistance " , Drake worries about fame changing him , with lyrics veering from his ailing grandmother to a one @-@ night stand that resulted in an abortion . " Over " incorporates an orchestral backdrop , and according to Michael Cragg of musicOMH , contains three hooks . The artful song is about the elation and confusion that accompanies fame . " Show Me a Good Time " opens and closes with a squeaky yelling sound . On the song , Drake talks addresses hip hop listeners who find him inauthentic . " Up All Night " has menacing strings , and Drake boastfully rapping about his nightlife , while trading lines with Nicki Minaj . The club song " Fancy " has a predominant hook , looped samples , and backwards strings . It is an ode to women who spend hours primping in preparation for the nightlife . The song features vocals by producer Swizz Beatz and T.I. , with additional harmonies by Mary J. Blige at the song 's conclusion . " Shut It Down " is a piano ballad and slow jam . 
 " Light Up " features loud synth drums and plaintive piano strings . The Jay @-@ Z @-@ collaboration is a critique on the hip hop industry , its detrimental effects , and the trappings of being an artist : " While all my closest friends out <unk> ' / I 'm just here makin ' the music that they party to , " while Jay @-@ Z gives advice : " Drake , here ’ s how they gonna come at you / with silly rap feuds , trying to distract you . " Jay @-@ Z expands on the album 's overarching theme of self @-@ doubt : " And since no good deed go unpunished / I 'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was / I once was cool as the Fonz was / But these bright lights turned me to a monster . " " Miss Me " has Lil Wayne rapping jokes , including a crude punch line about sucking " the brown " off his penis and subsequently groaning , " <unk> , that 's nasty . " " Cece 's Interlude " has a Prince @-@ like LinnDrum and transparent lyrics addressing a girl : " I wish I / Wasn 't famous / I wish I / Was still in school / So that I could have you in my dorm room / I would put it on you crazy . " The pop song " Find Your Love " was produced by Kanye West and bears similarity to his 2008 song " Heartless " .

 Thank Me Later received generally positive reviews from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 75 , based on 26 reviews . Tim Sendra of AllMusic complimented its " rich and nuanced production and Drake 's thoughtful , playful , and intense lyrics " , and felt that his " willingness to be introspective and honest ... makes [ him ] unique and helps make Thank Me Later special . " Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media commented that " Drake vies for superstardom while embracing his non @-@ drug @-@ dealing , non @-@ violent , non @-@ dire <unk> one that connects with most rap fans in a completely reasonable way . " Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club commented that " on his cohesive , bittersweet , assured debut , he proves himself worthy of the sometimes @-@ blinding spotlight . " Rolling Stone 's Jody Rosen found Drake to be " in total command of a style that would have been hard to imagine dominating hip @-@ hop a few years ago " .

Pete Cashmore from NME believed " it 's those constant and predictable superstar interjections that prevent the album from standing out as much as it had potential to do .

 = Jack Ely = 
 Jack Brown Ely ( September 11 , 1943 – April 28 , 2015 ) was an American guitarist and singer , best known for singing the Kingsmen 's version of " Louie Louie " . Classically trained in piano , he began playing guitar after seeing Elvis Presley on television . In 1959 , he co @-@ founded the Kingsmen and with them recorded " Louie Louie " in 1963 ; Ely 's famously incoherent vocals were partly the result of his braces and the rudimentary recording method . Before the record became a hit Ely was forced out of the group and began playing with his new band , the Courtmen . Ely died in Terrebonne , Oregon , on April 28 , 2015 at age 71 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Jack Ely was born on September 11 , 1943 in Portland , Oregon , near the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers . Both of his parents were music majors at the University of Oregon , and his father , Ken Ely , was a singer . His father died when he was four years old and his mother subsequently remarried . 
 Ely began playing piano while still a young child , and was performing recitals all over the Portland area before his seventh birthday . When he was eleven , a piano teacher provided what he termed " jazz improvisation lessons . " The teacher would show Ely a section of a classical composition , and the boy would have to make up 15 similar pieces . He would be required to share each in class and then make up one on the spot . 
 On January 28 , 1956 , Ely watched Elvis Presley on television for the first time , and he decided that he wanted to play guitar . At his first guitar lesson , he was required to play " Mary Had a Little Lamb " , an experience that Ely found so demeaning that he quit after that lesson and began picking out his favorite guitar riffs by ear . Ely played guitar and sang for the Young Oregonians , a travelling vaudeville show for entertainers under the age of 18 . " We didn 't get paid in money , we got paid in experience , " Ely recalled . 
 = = The Kingsmen = = 
 Ely was enrolled at Washington High School in Portland , Oregon . He did not play in the school band , but had a passion for singing . In 1959 , Lynn Easton 's mother invited him to play at a Portland hotel gig , with Ely singing and playing guitar with the backup band and Easton on the drum kit . The two teenagers grew up together , as their parents were close friends . Easton and Ely performed at yacht club parties , and soon added Mike Mitchell on guitar and Bob Nordby on bass to round out a band . They called themselves The Kingsmen , taking the name from a recently disbanded group . The Kingsmen began their collective career playing at fashion shows , Red Cross events , and <unk> promotions , generally avoiding rock songs on their setlist . Ely played with the Kingsmen as he attended Portland State University . 
 In 1962 , while playing a gig at the <unk> Club in Seaside , Oregon , the band noticed Rockin ' Robin Roberts 's version of " Louie Louie " being played on the jukebox for hours on end . The entire club would get up and dance . Ely convinced the Kingsmen to learn the song , which they played at dances to a great crowd response . Unknown to him , he changed the beat from 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 , 1 – 2 , 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 , 1 – 2 to 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 , 1 – 2 , 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 , 1 – 2 because he based it on the intro only . Ken Chase , host of radio station <unk> , formed his own club to capitalize on these dance crazes . Dubbed " The Chase " , the Kingsmen became the club 's house band and Ken Chase became the band 's manager . Ely was begging Chase to let the band record their own version of " Louie Louie " , and on April 5 , 1963 , Chase booked the band an hour @-@ long session at the local Northwestern Inc. studio for the following day . The band had just played a 90 @-@ minute " Louie Louie " marathon . 
 Despite the band 's annoyance at having so little time to prepare , the Kingsmen walked into the recording studio on April 6 at 10 : 00 am . In order to sound like a live performance , the group 's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to lean back and sing into a boom microphone suspended high above the floor . " It was more yelling than singing , " Ely said , " ' cause I was trying to be heard over all the instruments . " In addition , he was wearing braces at the time of the performance , further compounding his infamously slurred words . Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early , but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up . In what was thought to be a warm @-@ up , the song was recorded in its first and only take . The Kingsmen were not proud of the version , but their manager liked the rawness of their cover . The B @-@ side was " Haunted Castle " , composed by Ely and Don Gallucci , the new keyboardist . However , credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels . The entire session cost $ 50 , and the band split the difference . 
 On August 16 , during a band practice , Easton told Ely that he wanted to abandon the drums and become the frontman and singer . Ely would have to become the drummer , and since The Kingsmen was registered in Easton 's name only , he technically led the band . Ely was not happy with this turn of events , and he and Nordby left the band at once . At the time , the song had sold roughly 600 copies and it was thought that the Kingsmen would disband . When he found out " Louie Louie " was climbing up the Billboard charts , Ely attempted to rejoin the group , but was blocked by Easton who was intent on adding replacements . Undeterred , Ely went on to form his own " Kingsmen " group and also recorded " Love That Louie " in 1964 for RCA Records as Jack E. Lee and the Squires . A legal battle ensued , resulting in Ely ceasing to call his group the Kingsmen and Wand Records being required to credit Ely as lead vocalist on all future " Louie Louie " pressings . Ely received $ 6000 in royalties , and Easton had to stop lip @-@ synching the song in live performances . 
 = = Later life and career = = 
 Ely began touring with his renamed group , the Courtmen . In 1966 , they released " Louie Louie ' 66 " and " Ride Ride Baby " with Bang Records ; neither charted . With the Vietnam War on the horizon , Ely was conscripted into the army , and found his career had waned upon his return to the United States in 1968 . Ely spiraled down into drug and alcohol addiction , but then spoke out against it with the Rockers Against Drugs . 
 Ely lived at his farm in Terrebonne , Oregon , where he trained horses . He was a strong supporter of the Performance Rights Act , which would give royalties to recording artists and record labels . Since Ely was not the original author , he never received any money from the radio play of " Louie Louie . " In an interview , he said , " It 's not just about me . There are a lot of one @-@ hit wonders out there just like me who deserve compensation when their recorded performances are played and stations get ad revenue from it . " 
 In 2012 , Ely released a Christian rock album , Love Is All Around You Now .

 Ely died at his Oregon residence on April 28 , 2015 at the age of 71 , having long suffered from an unknown illness . " Because of his religious beliefs , we 're not even sure what it [ the illness ] was , " his son Sean Ely said . He was a Christian Scientist and Sean Ely believed his father suffered from skin cancer . 
 At the time of his death he was survived by his wife of 16 years , Wendy Maxson Ely , three children , Sean , Sierra and Rob , and two daughters by marriage , Chrystal and Sheri . He was also survived by two sisters , six grandchildren , and two great @-@ grandchildren .

 = 1994 Progress Party national convention = 
 The 1994 national convention of the Progress Party of Norway was held from 15 April to 17 April at the hotel Bolkesjø <unk> in Bolkesjø , Telemark . It was originally set up to be a normal convention with 157 delegates in a non @-@ election year , but because of mounting antagonism between a traditionalist and a libertarian faction , it became clear some months before the conventions that personal positions could be at stake . The party leader seat , held by Carl I. Hagen since 1978 , was up for re @-@ election . The deputy leaders Ellen Wibe and Hans J. <unk> was not up for election until 1995 , but there were talks about forming a motion of no confidence against Wibe . The political disagreements roughly corresponded to a cleavage between two factions . 
 The traditionalist ( also called populist ) faction was represented by party leader Carl I. Hagen , Jan Simonsen , Fridtjof Frank Gundersen , Vidar Kleppe , Øystein Hedstrøm , <unk> Solholm and Eli Hagen . The libertarians of the party were first and foremost the deputy leader Ellen Wibe and four members of Parliament ( by some called the " band of four " ) , Ellen Christine Christiansen , Oscar D. Hillgaar , Roy N. Wetterstad and Stephen Bråthen . Buskerud county leader Geir Thoresen , Akershus county leader Per Aage Pleym Christensen and Youth of the Progress Party leader Lars Erik Grønntun were other prominent libertarians . Both during the preceding months and on the opening day , resolutions were passed which ensured full dominance for Carl I. Hagen and the policies of his faction . Wibe resigned as deputy leader , and Carl I. Hagen 's men ( there were no women left in the leadership ) also dominated the new central committee . The personal issues totally overshadowed the regular political debate , and as early as on 17 April the convention was famously dubbed as the " national convention at Dolkesjø " — derived from <unk> , the Norwegian word for dagger . 
 In April and May , the Progress Party lost several members , including former members of Parliament and four current members of Parliament . In July the Youth of the Progress Party dissolved itself in protest of the events ; however , a new , loyal organization immediately surfaced . Some of the withdrawn members joined the Conservative Party of Norway , others joined an entirely new organization ( originally with the narrow intention to support the four parliamentarians ) , the quasi @-@ political party Free Democrats .

 = = = Before 1994 = = = 
 The 1993 national convention was harmonic . The newspaper Verdens Gang remarked that both " the libertarians and the populists cheered " after Carl I. Hagen 's speeches . Jan Simonsen stepped down as deputy leader , and Ellen Wibe succeeded him , being one of the very few women in the Progress Party 's leadership . 
 There were some tensions , however . Finn Thoresen left the party in November 1992 , and later formed New Future Coalition Party . More importantly , because of disagreements in 1992 and 1993 , pertaining to libertarianism in general and especially the European Union question , several libertarians that had entered the Progress Party in the 1980s ceased their activity in the party . MPs Tor Mikkel Wara and Petter <unk> announced their intentions to leave politics after the end of their terms , as did Pål Atle Skjervengen . Jan Erik Fåne tried to win renomination , but the nomination meeting in Akershus put traditionalist Fridtjof Frank Gundersen on top of the ballot . Fåne was offered the second spot , but pulled out . Eight months later it turned out that holding the second spot on the ballot did indeed give a Parliament seat . 
 The issue of libertarianism became more pressing in the campaign for the Norwegian parliamentary election , 1993 , when Carl I. Hagen said to Verdens Gang that he did not support cutting the income tax . This was not in line with official party policy , and Hagen did not confer with the party , stating that " I had to take an independent initiative " . Ellen Wibe openly criticized the statement , so did former MP and tax spokesperson Steinar Maribo . The tax statement was later seen as the most important factor contributing to the growing Hagen — <unk> schism . In the election the Progress Party won ten seats , down from 22 in the 1989 election .

 = = = 1994 = = = 
 The year 1994 started with annual conventions in each county , scheduled between 15 January and 6 April . These conventions elected delegates to the national convention . Tension had mounted between party leader Carl I. Hagen and other factions in the party . Parts of the central committee were skeptical to Hagen 's position and policies . In addition , the youth wing , Youth of the Progress Party , had experienced disagreements with the Hagen @-@ led Progress Party . The leader of the Youth of the Progress Party , Lars Erik Grønntun , had been on the verge of stepping down , but was persuaded around the end of 1993 to run for re @-@ election . Before the county conventions , Grønntun stated a desire for an extraordinary meeting between the party and its youth wing , where he wanted to " contribute to gathering the party and avoid any signs of a split " . 
 On 3 January , Hagen presented a ten @-@ point plan of action . It was to be sent to each county chapter , and supported or rejected at the county conventions . On 7 January , Ellen Wibe presented a competing plan of action together with Oscar Hillgaar , Ellen Christine Christiansen and Geir Thoresen . Wibe 's plan criticized the party 's organizational culture , communication and institutions . In an interview , Wibe said that the party was too similar to a " charismatic movement " , and that she wanted more power to the central board ( Norwegian : <unk> ) . Øystein Hedstrøm announced a possible motion of no confidence regarding Ellen Wibe 's position as deputy party leader , even though she was not really up for election until 1995 . Wibe replied that her intention was to gather the party . 
 = = = County conventions and national board meeting = = = 
 In the weekend from 4 to 6 February , county conventions were held in eleven counties , including Hagen 's native Oslo , and Buskerud , Finnmark , Telemark , Vest @-@ Agder , Hordaland , Nordland , Østfold , Troms , Nord @-@ Trøndelag and Møre og Romsdal . Hagen belonged to the Oslo chapter , but the leader of the chapter , Peter N. Myhre , stated beforehand that Hagen 's proposal would probably be rejected . It was speculated that rejections could come from the Buskerud and Finnmark 's conventions as well . On 7 February , Hagen confirmed his leadership candidacy for the electoral committee . 
 On 19 February , the party held a national board ( Norwegian : <unk> ) meeting at Bolkesjø . Here , Hagen proposed to close the debate on " the party profile and choice of values " , a motion which gained support from 11 of the 24 board members . Ellen Wibe was among the minority , but conceded for the time being . That way , the question was put down before reaching the national convention . 
 By then , fifteen county conventions had signalized support for Hagen . After the last convention , it was clear that one @-@ third of the delegates had expressed support of Wibe . Before the national convention , Hagen stated in an interview that one " never can know what will happen during a Progress Party national convention " . 
 = = = Further preparations = = = 
 The next two months was a quiet period , and Øystein Hedstrøm stated that Wibe had taken a more responsible role , and thus there was no need for a motion of no confidence . News commentator Aslak Bonde remarked that the compromise reached by the factions was " unclear " and that antagonism could surface at the national convention . Wibe stated that her faction still intended to submit a resolution , a " constructive " proposal regarding tactical and organizational issues . Two days before the national convention , this resolution text had not been submitted to the county delegates . On the next day , the resolution text was commented in newspapers . Aftenposten remarked that Wibe 's proposal was a " thorough criticism of Carl I. Hagen " , among others in that it called for " a renewal of the party " . It was signed by Oscar D. Hillgaar , Ellen Chr . Christiansen , Stephen Bråthen and Roy Wetterstad together with Wibe . Verdens Gang reported that Wibe would resign if not given a clear confidence as deputy leader . Wibe refuted this in Aftenposten on the next day ; the newspaper believed that no party split would occur . 
 Another question of contention was the Progress Party 's policy on Norwegian membership in the European Union . Reportedly , Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone a decision on European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June . Others were not in favor of this . In an interview , Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other . He stated an indifference towards EU membership , and that if accessing the Union , Norway could always use a veto against EU policies when needed . Central board member Terje <unk> submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership .

 Carl I. Hagen held the opening speech of the convention . The speech was interrupted by extensive applause nineteen times . In it , he stated : 
 = = = Resolutions and withdrawals = = = 
 One of the first questions which was voted over , was the EU issue . Hagen formally submitted a proposal that the factual aspects of this issue should not be debated , and this was passed with 113 against 44 votes . 
 The EU vote directly caused Ellen Wibe to step down as deputy party leader , stating that she did " not fully understand the new profile of the party " . If not stepping down , she would compromise " values and principles " that were essential in order to " live with [ her ] self as a human being " . The announcement followed a private meeting between Wibe , Hagen , <unk> and Grønntun . Allegedly , Tor Mikkel Wara had advised her to resign . Ellen Christine Christiansen stepped down from her position in the central board , leaving Grønntun as the only clear libertarian . Grønntun stated that young party members would not tolerate to be " stepped on and <unk> with [ sic ] " forever . More generally , the losing faction signalized a desire to continue promoting a liberal political profile , but in a less dramatic way . 
 Immediately after Wibe 's announcement , Jan Simonsen entered the chair and spoke strongly in favor of Hagen . Fridtjof Frank Gundersen applauded the end of " women 's bickering " in the party leadership . Hagen 's main resolution proposal , titled En <unk> med rot i <unk> , was passed with 94 against 50 votes . He also received support for prioritizing anti @-@ immigration higher in the following period . In his closing speech , Hagen stated that " disloyal " behavior would be considered as " active withdrawal " from the party . From the rostrum , the " band of four " was even asked to withdraw by several delegates , including Bjørn Andreassen , Gustav Hareide and <unk> Lange . Andreassen exclaimed that " we don 't want you " , while Lange asked the band of four to form a new party called the Anarchist Party . 
 The central board held an extraordinary meeting on 17 April , during a pre @-@ scheduled break in the convention . The central board of the Youth of the Progress Party also met , and agreed to support the " band of four " . Their decision was not final until an extraordinary national board meeting could be held . It was speculated that members of the youth wing could leave the Progress Party en masse . 
 = = = New deputy leader = = = 
 After Wibe 's resignation , Jan Simonsen was mentioned as an , albeit unlikely , candidate to succeed Wibe . Vidar Kleppe was also mentioned , while traditionalist John <unk> was regarded by newspapers as a more likely candidate . On Saturday 16 April , it became clear that the vote stood between the Peter N. Myhre and <unk> Solholm . Myhre was the candidate put forward by the electoral committee , and had support among the libertarians , who did not field their own candidate . On 17 April , Solholm won the vote with 90 against 58 ; 8 ballots were blank . Carl I. Hagen was re @-@ elected with 113 against 0 votes , and with 44 blank ballots . One libertarian , former MP Terje <unk> , who described the convention as a " genocide " , was elected to the national board .

 Political scientist Frank <unk> summed up the convention turmoil in the following way : 
 = = = Band of four defect = = = 
 Already on the second day of the convention it was speculated that the " band of four " , four libertarian @-@ leaning members of Parliament , considered leaving the party . The four were Oscar D. Hillgaar , Roy Wetterstad , Ellen Christine Christiansen and Stephen Bråthen . The alternative to leaving the party was to mark themselves as dissenting party members . On the third day , news surfaced that the four had talked together . In the news program <unk> on 17 April , the band of four stated a desire to follow the 1993 party platform and not later resolutions . They were met by a demand from Carl I. Hagen that they continue on the " terms laid down by the national convention or find something else to do " . He later added that if the band of four left the parliamentary group , they should " scram " . To sum up , he said that the libertarians , which were known to be a minority , had gained too much influence , and was set back by the national convention . Øystein Hedstrøm demanded that the four leave the party . Because of the fierce personal antagonism at the convention , it was dubbed as the " national convention at Dolkesjø " — derived from <unk> , the Norwegian word for dagger . 
 Wibe encouraged people to stay in the Progress Party , although her active participation was over . Wetterstad stated in an interview that withdrawing his party membership was out of question , whereas Hillgaar was described as the least conciliatory . Hillgaar publicly lamented the " Moscow processes " of the 1994 national convention , and also the views on women and the " extreme xenophobia " which he felt was conveyed by the party program . The Progress Party county leader in Akershus , Per Aage Pleym Christensen , also reconsidered his position , leaving on 4 May . 
 Oscar Hillgaar left the party on 22 April . The other three libertarian parliamentarians postponed their decision , attending meetings with county leaders on 17 and 22 April . A leading figure in these talks was Henning <unk> from Oslo . Hagen replied that such talks had no grounds in the Progress Party by @-@ laws . The meeting on 22 April went well for the three parliamentarians , but on 30 April the central committee met , and Øystein Hedstrøm put forward a proposal for a " loyalty declaration " to Hagen and the policies agreed to on the national convention . The proposal of a written declaration was not passed , but the central committee decided to demand loyalty . It also removed Lars Erik Grønntun from the executive board ( Norwegian : <unk> ) . 
 The three parliamentarians finally left the party on 3 May . It was speculated that the deputy representatives for Bråthen and Wetterstad , Per Aage Pleym Christensen in Akershus and Geir Thoresen in Buskerud , would follow . Wetterstad drew the lines to Hagen 's own withdrawal from the Anders Lange Party to form the short @-@ lived Reform Party . Coincidentally , Hagen celebrated his 50th birthday on 6 May . 
 = = = Youth wing defects = = = 
 With four of ten having resigned from the parliamentary group , the Youth of the Progress Party was the next institution to experience turmoil . In May Verdens Gang announced that a forthcoming extraordinary national convention , spearheaded by Lars Erik Grønntun , would cut its ties with the Progress Party . The county leader in Oslo , Kim M. <unk> , formally proposed such a move . A straight @-@ forward dissolution of the Youth of the Progress Party would , however , most likely be followed by an immediate resurrection of the youth wing by Hagen @-@ loyal members . <unk> 's proposal was quickly co @-@ signed by the Akershus branch , through its leader Trine Beate <unk> , and the Buskerud branch through its leader Per Magne Pedersen . The county chapters in Telemark , Aust @-@ Agder , Vest @-@ Agder , Oppland and Rogaland also voiced support . Hordaland had considered it . National deputy Ole Tom <unk> was reluctant to comment , but at the national convention he called Ellen Wibe " one of the finest people in Norwegian politics " . He was threatened with exclusion in June , ahead of the convention . 
 Two days before the national convention , the central committee convened and supported a dissolution of the Youth of the Progress Party . Lars Erik Grønntun even announced plans to cooperate more with the Norwegian Young Conservatives and the Young Liberals of Norway . Young Conservatives leader André <unk> was not negative . 
 The national convention agreed on dissolving the Youth of the Progress Party , with 63 against 21 votes . Hagen @-@ loyal members summoned the Progress Party national board , which overruled the decision , allowing the remaining members to continue with Ulf <unk> as leader . 
 = = = Other defections = = = 
 Already before the national convention , the entire local party chapter in Osterøy was disestablished , but mainly due to the European Union controversy . The party had one representative in Osterøy municipal council at the time . One day after the national convention , delegate Kristian <unk> announced his withdrawal from the party , though he would sit through his tenure as member of Hordaland county council , which lasted until 1995 . <unk> was a former member of the central board , and also a former deputy member of Parliament . The same day former MP and youth wing leader Pål Atle Skjervengen withdrew , commenting that the libertarians " are asked by the party leadership to go to hell " . Skjervengen had been criticized by Carl I. Hagen from the rostrum at the national convention . Many years down the road Skjervengen joined the Conservative Party . Harald Eide <unk> , member of Stavanger city council , also left . 
 In <unk> municipal council , three of five representatives left the party , and a fourth , former MP Steinar Maribo , considered doing the same . As did Odd Magnar <unk> , and former deputy MP Paal <unk> . Terje <unk> withdrew from the central committee in early May . The leader in the chapters in Finnmark and Nordkapp , Bjørn Magne <unk> , withdrew on 13 May . He cited a lack of liberalism , especially with regards to gay rights and immigration , as the reason . He was the only Progress Party member of a municipal council in Finnmark . Maribo withdrew some time in May . In late May , party secretary Hans Andreas <unk> had counted 270 withdrawals , but also 76 new members . Municipal and county council member Liv <unk> left after the youth wing 's national convention in July , so did Tor Mikkel Wara , Ellen Wibe , Jan Erik Fåne and Petter <unk> . Hordaland county council member Lene C. <unk> <unk> left and joined the Conservative Party in October . 
 = = = New party = = = 
 Already during the national convention , the Youth of the Progress Party agreed to form an informal " thinking group " for disenfranchised members . Pål Atle Skjervengen was early in declaring an interest in forming a new , libertarian party . Those who resigned from the parliamentary group initially declared a lack of motivation to form a new party , and they also rejected the possibility of joining another party . They would instead vote according to the 1993 party program . Either way , in a parliamentary context they were known as independents for the remainder of their term . They did discuss the possibility of forming a " support group " which would help the four parliamentarians with practical issues . Odd Magnar <unk> contributed advice on an informal basis from time to time . With some time passed since the Bolkesjø convention , it was decided to hold a formal conference to form a support group in mid @-@ June . Organizations in Akershus and Buskerud already existed , under the names of <unk> Akershus and Buskerud <unk> Forum . 
 At the conference , the name Free Democrats ( Norwegian : <unk> ) was adopted , and the band of four were chosen as leaders . Two hundred people joined , and it had four county leaders ; Per Aage Pleym Christensen for Akershus , Geir Thoresen for Buskerud , the former city council secretary Roy <unk> Tollefsen in Oslo and Thor Simonsen in Østfold . Wibe , on the other hand , left politics , as did Lars Erik Grønntun . The board members of Aust @-@ Agder Youth of the Progress Party joined the Free Democrats in August . Ellen Christine Christiansen stated that " time will tell whether we become a political party " . The issue was discussed again at a national convention in September 1994 . The Vestfold chapter wanted to field in the Norwegian parliamentary election , 1997 with Oscar Hillgaar on the ballot , but this did not happen . 
 = Ontario Highway 58 = 
 King 's Highway 58 , commonly referred to as Highway 58 , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . The route is divided into two segments with a combined length of 15 @.@ 5 km ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) . The southern segment travels from Niagara Regional Road 3 , formerly Highway 3 , in Port Colborne , to the Highway 58A junction in the southern end of Welland , a distance of 7 @.@ 2 km ( 4 @.@ 5 mi ) . The northern segment begins at Highway 20 near Allanburg and travels north and west to a large junction with Highway 406 at the St. Catharines – Thorold boundary , a distance of 8 @.@ 3 km ( 5 @.@ 2 mi ) . An 18 @.@ 1 km ( 11 @.@ 2 mi ) gap separates the two segments within Welland and Pelham . The entire route is located within the Regional Municipality of Niagara . 
 The history of Highway 58 is tumultuous due to various relocation projects resulting from the construction of the fourth Welland Canal and Highway 406 . Prior to 1997 , Highway 58 was continuous and travelled through the west side of Welland , maintained under a Connecting Link agreement . The route was first established in 1935 , though it remained unnumbered on the 1935 and 1936 official road maps . By 1937 it extended from Port Colborne to St. Catharines , though the route it travelled between those places shifted several times over the following 30 years . In the late 1990s , the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) transferred several highways or portions of highways throughout the province to lower levels of government . Highway 58 was decommissioned through Welland on April 1 , 1997 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The segment between Highway 406 in Thorold and Niagara Road 57 east of Thorold is a four @-@ lane freeway . It also contains the Thorold Tunnel , one of the three tunnels under the Welland Canal . The remaining segments vary between a two @-@ lane rural highway and four @-@ lane urban roadway . Overall , the highway is 15 @.@ 5 km ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) in length , with a 18 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 11 @.@ 2 mi ) gap separating the two sections . 
 The southern section of Highway 58 begins at a junction with the former Highway 3 in the city of Port Colborne , several kilometres north of Lake Erie . South of this intersection , the road once continued as Niagara Regional Road 64 to <unk> Street ; such has since been downloaded to the city of Port Colborne . Proceeding north , the highway , known locally as West Side Road , passes through the suburbs of Port Colborne , north of which it skirts the eastern edge of the Wainfleet Bog , one of the few remaining habitats of the <unk> Rattlesnake . West of Dain City , Highway 58 crosses the Port Colborne – Welland boundary at Forks Road , a grade @-@ separated intersection . The route crosses several rail lines on a bridge south of its terminus at Highway 58A ( Humberstone Road ) at the southern edge of the built up area of Welland . North of there , it continues as Niagara Regional Road 54 ( Prince Charles Drive ) 
 The northern section of Highway 58 begins at an intersection with the western terminus of Highway 20 , approximately 3 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) east of Highway 406 , within Thorold . South of this intersection , the road that carries Highway 58 continues as Niagara Regional Road 82 , whereas west of the intersection the road that carries Highway 20 , Lundy 's Lane , continues as Niagara Regional Road 58 through Allanburg . Highway 58 proceeds north , at first along an established concession road , before branching to the east on its own alignment known as Davis Road . The route crosses several flooded valleys that form part of the Welland Canal before arriving at Thorold Stone Road , at which point Highway 58 turns west and enters the Thorold Tunnel , descending beneath the canal . 
 At the western end of the tunnel , Highway 58 emerges as a divided highway in Thorold . It meets an interchange with Pine Street ; the eastbound on @-@ ramp from Pine Street features a stop sign and no merging lane prior to entering the Thorold Tunnel . West of Pine Street , the route passes beneath a Trillium Railway line and curves slightly southwest . It encounters an interchange with Collier Street , gradually curving to the northwest and passing beneath Richmond Street . Highway 58 ends at a complicated interchange with both St. Davids Road as well as Highway 406 on the edge of the Niagara Escarpment . 
 = = History = = 
 The first portion of what became Highway 58 was assumed on September 4 , 1935 . Although only a short stub travelling south from Main Street in Welland ( then Highway 3A ) , it connected to a road owned by the Welland Canal Authority ( WCA ) travelling along the east side of the old canal , now known by various names including Barber Drive , Canal Road , Kingsway , and Canal Bank Street . Initially unnumbered , the route was extended to Port Colborne and St. Catharines on October 6 , 1937 , and by then had been given the designation of Highway 58 . It now began at Highway 3 in Port Colborne and travelled to Welland along the east side of the canal , and thereafter north along Niagara Street , the Merrittville Highway and <unk> Road ( Niagara Regional Road 50 ) to Highway 8 in downtown St. Catharines . 
 On July 17 and 30 , 1958 , the Department of Highways assumed the West Side Road , constructed in the years prior by Welland County between Port Colborne and Welland . The old highway was turned back to the WCA on June 26 and September 4 of that same year . Highway 58 then entered Welland along what is now Prince Charles Drive , meeting and becoming concurrent with Highway 3A at Riverside Drive / Lincoln Street and then turning east along East Main Street . By 1960 , the Welland Bypass was completed along the routing of the former Niagara , St. Catharines and Toronto Railway interurban line – the final operating interurban railway in Canada , which ceased operations on the line on March 28 , 1959 . This rerouted the highway along what is now Prince Charles Drive northwest to Thorold Road , where it turned east to Niagara Street . 
 North of Welland , Highway 58 initially travelled concurrent with Highway 3A along Niagara Street and the Merrittville Highway to Highway 20 , where Highway 3A ended . Highway 58 turned east and travelled concurrent with Highway 20 across the Welland Canal at Allanburg , before turning north onto the current route . However , it continued north along Allanburg Road into Thorold , where it crossed the Welland Canal on a swing bridge and travelled north into St. Catharines along Ormond Street , Merritt Street and <unk> Road ( Niagara Regional Road 52 ) to Highway 8 ( Queenston Street , now Niagara Regional Road 81 ) . 
 = = = Effect of the Thorold Tunnel and Highway 406 = = = 
 The routing of Highway 58 was eventually <unk> by two major changes within the Niagara Peninsula . The first was the construction of the Thorold Tunnel , which was built as part of the larger Welland Bypass project of the Welland Canal in order to minimize road and rail crossings that plagued the length of the canal prior to the 1970s . The Thorold Tunnel was designed to carry a divided four lane road beneath the canal , bypassing the swinging bridge between Allanburg Road and Ormond Street . It was built during the winter months between 1965 and 1967 , with the canal drained , and opened on September 18 , 1968 . Following its completion , Highway 58 was rerouted through the tunnel , west of which it forked . At the Pine Road interchange , one fork travelled north on Pine , east along Richmond Street and north along Ormond Street ( now Niagara Regional Road 52 ) . The other fork followed the present route . As part of the creation of the Regional Municipality of Niagara , Highway 8 was transferred to the newly formed region as well as the original alignment of Highway 58 . 
 The second change was the initial construction of Highway 406 in the mid @-@ 1960s , establishing a new northern terminus for Highway 58 at the St. Davids Road interchange on the Niagara Escarpment . The St. Davids Road interchange was fully opened with the Highway 406 extension to Beaverdams Road on November 21 , 1969 . Eventually Highway 406 would reroute the section of Highway 58 along the Merrittville Highway between Welland and Highway 20 to instead turn east from Niagara Street along Merritt Road , where it curved north to become the two @-@ laned Highway 406 . This happened when Highway 406 was extended south from Beaverdams Road to Merritt Road on June 30 , 1971 .

 Budget constraints brought on by a recession in the 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the Who Does What ? committee in 1995 to determine cost @-@ cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred by former premier Bob Rae . It was determined that many Ontario highways no longer serve long @-@ distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government . The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 ( downloading ) , removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network . As Highway 58 had largely been replaced by Highway 406 , the central segment through Welland and Pelham was deemed to no longer serve long @-@ distance traffic , and was downloaded to the Regional Municipality of Niagara on April 1 , 1997 . It now exists as Regional Road 54 along Prince Charles Drive and Regional Road 50 along Niagara Street and the Merrittville Highway . 
 No part of Highway 58 today follows the original 1935 route along the Welland Canal . Only a 6 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 2 mi ) section of the 1937 routing , north from Highway 20 ( Lundy 's Lane ) is still used by the route now .

 = Victorious Boxers : Ippo 's Road to Glory = 
 Victorious Boxers : Ippo 's Road to Glory , known in Japan as Hajime no Ippo : Victorious Boxers ( はじめの一歩 <unk> <unk> , lit . " The First Step : Victorious Boxers " ) , is a Japanese @-@ developed boxing video game created by New Corporation for the Sony PlayStation 2 video game console . It is based on the manga and anime series Hajime no Ippo . Though the original series is very popular in Japan , it is not as widely known in the United States ( US ) . The game was released in Japan on December 14 , 2000 and in North America on November 5 , 2001 . 
 The game features a mix of simulation and arcade style boxing . The storyline , which unfolds in the story mode , takes place in six linear segments that originally overlapped in the manga . The game 's fights mirrored the fights from the manga series . The beginning of the game focuses on Ippo Makunouchi 's rise to the Japanese Featherweight championship , and later switches to Ippo 's fellow gym mates ' careers . 
 Victorious Boxers was the first Fighting Spirit video game on the PlayStation 2 and was met with a mixed reception . It was commercially successful in Japan , but did poorly in the US . Victorious Boxers received positive review scores , though aspects of the game were both criticized and praised . The visual style and graphics were poorly received , while industry experts considered it to be " one of the most technically accurate representation of the sport of boxing " . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Victorious Boxers 's gameplay is a mix between simulation and arcade style boxing . It features 3D character models fighting each other within a boxing ring . The game keeps track of the fight records and saves it to the memory card , via an auto @-@ save option . In addition , actual matches can be saved to the memory card as " replay data " and be viewed later . Eighteen camera angles available during matches , some of which include a first person view from either character , a TV camera angle , and overhead views for various angles . 
 The controls were designed to give more realistic movement to characters . Characters can dash , bob and weave in all eight directions . The punches are divided into left and right jabs / hooks . When punches are used in conjunction with " technique " and " special " buttons , extra types of punches can be executed . Combinations and counter @-@ punches are also possible . By combining upper body movements with punches , players can duck down and hit to the body or lean back and throw a quick punch to the head . The initial setup uses the left analog stick for all the character 's bodily movements ; minor movements to the stick control the upper body movements , while larger movements control the lower body and movement within the ring . 
 Victorious Boxers does not use a damage or life meter . Instead , visible damage can be seen on a boxer 's face , which is most noticeable between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners . The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises , swelling , and black eyes on the characters ' faces . Another sign of damage is the characters ' speed of movement throughout the fight . The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue . The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves , the more their stamina is affected . Distance is a factor in determining a punch 's damage . For example , a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length . Also , right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent 's left and vice versa . 
 = = = Modes = = = 
 The game has two modes , a single player story mode and a multi @-@ player versus mode . The story mode follows the boxing careers of the main characters from the original series . All characters available to the player are from the Kamogawa Boxing Gym . Cut scenes are added in before and after matches as the main story telling device , and utilize the same character models as the fights . The game has six story arcs and begins with Makunouchi Ippo , the protagonist from the manga series . Story mode also unlocks more options in the versus mode as a player progresses through the story . Once a character has been played or a special technique learned , they become available in the versus mode . Likewise , once an opponent has been beaten , they are playable in the versus mode . 
 The versus mode is a free fighting mode where multiple players can box . The number of players can range from 0 – 2 ; both fighters can be controlled by either the computer or by a player . Initially there are only two playable characters ; additional characters become accessible by playing through the story mode . Although the characters are grouped by their boxing weight class , any character can be selected to fight another regardless of weight class . Players can choose from ten locations for the bout . Initially , the only available arena is the Kamogawa Boxing Gym basement . New locations become available once a fight occurs there in the story mode . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting and characters = = = 
 Victorious Boxers is set in Tokyo , Japan . The story unfolds via cut scenes set in either the Kamogawa Boxing Gym , the fictional boxing gym of the main characters , or the waiting rooms of the boxing arenas . The gameplay takes place in boxing arenas , some of which are based on locations in Japan and include Korakuen Hall , <unk> Sports Arena , and the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium . Other locations include the mountainous area around Niigata , and an outdoor boxing ring set in post @-@ World War II Tokyo , Japan . 
 The game features forty @-@ four playable characters — forty @-@ two characters and two duplicate characters that have handicapped abilities . The protagonist is Ippo Makunouchi , but the story shifts to his friends and fellow contenders as well . The game features most of the boxer up to the 53rd volume of the manga , including Ryuichi Hayami , Ryo Mashiba , <unk> Zangief , Kazuki Sanada , and <unk> Sawamura . Excluded are , Itagaki Manabu , Makino Fumito , Hama <unk> , and Rally Bernard . The different boxers span five different weight classes ; most boxers have a special move derived from the manga series . 
 The two duplicate characters are Ippo and Mamoru Takamura . The two characters are weaker than their normal versions and are embodiments of parts of the original story . The weaker Ippo is the first version of the character available . He wears sweats and a T @-@ shirt rather than the boxing trunks the other characters wear . This version is based on when Ippo began boxing and was training to fight his rival , Ichiro Miyata . The weaker Takamura has less muscle mass and looks ill . He is based on a fight in the manga when Takamura overdid his weight management . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The game begins with a sparring match with Ichiro Miyata , which is actually a rematch from a previous sparring match with Miyata that took place in the manga series . After winning , Ippo take his professional boxer exam to begin his boxing career . He then enters the East Japan Rookie Champion Tournament , and after succeeding , he faces the West Japan Rookie Champ , Takeshi Sendo . Ippo later enters the Class A tournament where he wins his chance to challenge the Japanese Featherweight Champion , Eiji Date . After losing to Eiji Date , Ippo climbs the ranks again to the featherweight championship , where he faces Sendo , who has become the new champion . After becoming the champion , Ippo then defends the title five times . 
 The story then shifts to one of Ippo 's <unk> , Masaru Aoki , who has been boxing for a number of years before Ippo . He enters the Class A Tournament , but loses . Afterward , he begins his comeback and rises through the Lightweight division to win the Lightweight Championship against <unk> <unk> . Aoki 's story differs from the manga in that Aoki lost several of the fights , and achieved a draw in the Title bout . After Aoki 's story arc , the game shifts again to another of Ippo 's <unk> , Tatsuya Kimura , who began boxing with Aoki . His story is very similar to Aoki 's in that he also enters the Class A Tournament and loses . Afterward , he begins his comeback that eventually leads to winning the Junior Lightweight Championship fight against Ryo Mashiba . Kimura 's story is also different than the manga in that he lost several of the fights and did not become the Junior Lightweight Champion . 
 The story switches again to Mamoru Takamura . His story is the most similar to the manga in that he is the only character in the series to have never lost a fight . It begins with Takamura as the Japanese Middleweight Champion , defending his title against the Class A Tournament winner . After winning , Takamura and the others go to a lodge in the mountains to train . While there he encounters a mountain bear that he knocks out . After having a successful boxing career in Japan , Takamura aims for a world title and receives a challenge from the World Junior Middleweight Champion , Brian Hawk . Takamura begins a strict weight management program to drop to Hawk 's weight class . When they eventually fight , Takamura is victorious and becomes the new Junior Middleweight Champion of the world . 
 After the main boxers have been played , Ippo visits his coach , Genji Kamogawa , at the mountain lodge . While there , he learns about Kamogawa 's history as a boxer via a flash back story . Kamogawa and his longtime friend and rival , Ginpachi Nekota , were both boxers before World War II . After the war , they boxed in exhibition matches . The two boxed each other often and once they met Yuki , a young girl from Hiroshima , their rivalry grew . While boxing , Kamogawa severely injured Nekota , but Nekota hide it because of their friendship . One day , Ralph Anderson , an American soldier stationed in their area , challenged and beat up the local boxers to show American dominance over Japanese boxers . Nekota challenges Anderson , but loses due to developing punch @-@ drunk syndrome from his fight with Kamogawa . During the fight , Anderson used an illegal punch on Nekota that worsened his condition . After Nekota 's defeat , Kamogawa begins intensive training to defeat Anderson . Through his training , he develops an " iron fist " technique . He then challenges Anderson , who because of his near loss has also trained extensively . After defeating Anderson , Kamogawa vows to pass on his boxing spirit to his students in order to show his boxing to the world . 
 = = Development = = 
 Victorious Boxers : Ippo 's Road to Glory was produced by Entertainment Software Publishing and was adapted from the Fighting Spirit manga series , at a time when the publishing company was focusing on its licensed comic properties rather than original titles . Development for the game was handled by New Corporation . The developers noted the capacities of the PlayStation 2 allowed them to reproduce the characters of the series accurately . The soundtrack of the game was composed by Takayuki Aihara , Shinji Hosoe and Naoki Tsuchiya . In May 2001 , British video game company Empire Interactive announced it would publish the game in Europe and North America . Since Empire 's presence in the United States market was minimal , a distribution deal was passed with Vivendi Universal for them to distribute the game , along with six other titles , in North America .

 In Japan , Victorious Boxers : Ippo 's Road to Glory was the fourth best @-@ selling game of December 14 , 2000 , and sold 256 @,@ 000 copies by February 18 , 2001 . It did not sell well in the United States however , mainly due to very little name recognition and poor marketing . Many reviews commented that the anime / manga style of characters and use of Japanese names were a turn off to US gamers who were more familiar with boxing games like Knockout Kings or Ready 2 Rumble . Despite the lack of sales , it received overall positive reviews and ratings . In 2001 , GameSpot awarded it " Best Game No One Played " . Next Generation Magazine stated , " It 's arguably the best 3D boxing game yet " and the versus mode offered " solid replay value " . 
 Many reviews commented on the graphics , citing there were other games with better graphics at the time . GamePro rated the graphics at 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 . Though the graphics were not well received , the character animations were very well received . The lack of audio dialog , which forced the player to read text for the story mode , was also a negative when many other games on the PS2 at the time were adding in voice overs . GamePro rated the overall sound a 3 out of 5 . Other reviews rated the audio better , particularly the music and sound effects during the fights . 
 The gameplay received mixed reviews . Reviews stated that Victorious Boxers was one of the most technically accurate boxing games of its time . Matt Helgeson of Game Informer described it as dramatically different from the " combo @-@ intensive , somewhat sluggish feel " of Knockout Kings . GameSpot stated the controls gave players " better boxer control " , and the " AI of the computer opponents is extremely advanced " . While many critics complimented the control scheme , they also commented on its difficulty to master . A common complaint was about characters improperly positioning itself in relation to the opponent while circling the ring . GamePro rated both the controls and fun factor a 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 , and mentioned though the controls were very intuitive and precise , " they require a lot of <unk> and dexterity " . Next Generation commented on the initial controls , stating they are problematic at first but can be reconfigured to suit the player .

 Victorious Boxers was followed by sequels on other video game consoles . The first title was Hajime no Ippo : The Fighting ! ( はじめの一歩 THE <unk> ！ ) , which was released only in Japan on December 12 , 2002 for the Game Boy Advance . The game features 2D graphics rather than 3D , and uses the Game Link Cable for two @-@ player gameplay . Two titles were released on the PlayStation 2 ; Hajime no Ippo 2 : Victorious Road and Victorious Boxers 2 : Fighting Spirit . Hajime no Ippo 2 : Victorious Road was released on January 29 , 2004 exclusively in Japan , and features a fighter @-@ creation mode and new boxers . Victorious Boxers 2 : Fighting Spirit was originally released in Japan on December 22 , 2004 as Hajime no Ippo : All @-@ Stars ( はじめの一歩 ALL ☆ STARS ) , and features gameplay similar to the first Victorious Boxers . It was later released in Europe in 2005 and in North America in 2006 . A title for the Wii , Victorious Boxers : Revolution ( はじめの一歩 REVOLUTION , Hajime no Ippo : Revolution ) , was released in Japan on June 21 , 2007 . It was later released in North America in October 2007 , and in PAL regions in 2008 . The game uses the Wii 's Wii Remote motion @-@ sensing controllers to simulate punching . 
 = William W. Chapman = 
 William Williams Chapman ( August 11 , 1808 – October 18 , 1892 ) was an American politician and lawyer in Oregon and Iowa . He was born and raised in Virginia . He served as a United States Attorney in Iowa when it was part of the Michigan and Wisconsin territories , and then represented the Iowa Territory in the United States House of Representatives . He later immigrated to the Oregon Country , where he served in the Oregon Territorial Legislature . 
 After settling in Portland , he helped to found The Oregonian newspaper and promoted economic interests in the city . He also was involved with building Canyon Road near Portland , and fought in the Rogue River War in Oregon . In later years , he served in the Oregon Legislative Assembly and promoted the expansion of railroads from Portland . Chapman Square , a park in downtown Portland , is named for him and was built on land he sold to the city . 
 = = Early life = = 
 William Chapman was born in Clarksburg , Virginia , ( now West Virginia ) on August 11 , 1808 . His father died when William was fourteen , at which time he left home to earn his own way . He was educated in the public schools , and then took a job as a court clerk , while studying law on his own time . In 1832 , after reading law , he earned his law license and began practice in Middletown . 
 Chapman married Margaret F. Ingraham in 1832 , and had seven children with her . They moved to Macomb , Illinois in 1833 , then to what is now Burlington , Iowa ( then part of Michigan Territory ) in 1835 , where they were among the first settlers . The next year he became a prosecuting attorney , and was then appointed by United States President Andrew Jackson as United States Attorney for the Michigan Territory . 
 = = Iowa = = 
 In 1836 , the Wisconsin Territory was formed from the western section of the Michigan Territory . Chapman became the first U.S. Attorney for this new territory when it was created . He was elected as colonel of the militia in 1836 after moving to what is now Dubuque , Iowa . Then in 1838 , the Iowa Territory was carved from the Wisconsin Territory . 
 Chapman was elected as Iowa Territory 's first non @-@ voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives . A Democrat , he served from September 10 , 1838 to October 27 , 1840 , spanning portions of the Twenty @-@ fifth and Twenty @-@ sixth Congresses . While in Congress he introduced legislation for a pre @-@ emption law , the first to do so in Congress . His efforts secured for Iowa the land grant of 500 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 000 km2 ) for the support of common schools , and a congressional report on Iowa 's boundary dispute with Missouri that was favorable to Iowa . 
 After his term expired , Chapman returned to Iowa , relocating in 1843 to Agency City in Wapello County . In 1844 , he served as a delegate to Iowa ’ s Constitutional Convention , which was held in Iowa City and led to the entry of Iowa into the Union as the 29th state in 1846 . Chapman left Iowa in 1847 , traveling the Oregon Trail to the Oregon Country . 
 = = Oregon = = 
 He left in May and arrived in November of what was still the unorganized Oregon Country . At this time the region was under the jurisdiction of the United States after the settling of the Oregon boundary dispute with Great Britain the previous year . In Oregon , Chapman settled first in what was then Marysville , and is now Corvallis , in the Willamette Valley . In 1848 , he relocated to Salem , where he learned of the California Gold Rush while at court at Knox Butte . Chapman went to California for a brief time and had some success in the gold fields before returning in 1849 to Oregon , which had become the Oregon Territory in 1848 . 
 He accompanied Joseph Lane , the newly appointed governor of the territory , on his return trip to Oregon . Chapman was elected to the first session of the Oregon Territorial Legislature later in 1849 , representing Champoeg County ( now Marion ) in the legislature 's lower house . After the legislature finished its session , he moved to Oregon City and then Portland , both downstream of Salem on the Willamette River . Later in 1849 , he took a trip to San Francisco , California , where he recruited Thomas J. Dryer to move to Portland and start a newspaper . He also purchased The Gold Hunter newspaper and moved the assets of the paper to Portland . In 1850 , The Oregonian began publishing as a weekly newspaper in Portland . Dryer served as the publisher with Chapman as a co @-@ founder . Chapman gave the paper its name . The assets of The Gold Hunter were used to start the paper . 
 Chapman purchased land in Portland from Stephen Coffin and Daniel H. Lownsdale in 1850 , which he then cleared and built a home . This is now the site of the Multnomah County Courthouse . In Portland , he was a promoter of the city and helped to get Canyon Road built to ensure the city would become the commercial center of Oregon . Chapman practiced law , and in October 1851 he was held in contempt of court by Oregon Supreme Court justice Orville C. Pratt . Chapman was ordered to be sent to jail in the county seat of Hillsboro for 20 days and disbarred , but never went to jail and the order was revoked when Pratt was replaced on the court by justice Thomas Nelson . Chapman had accused Pratt of mistreating lawyers in an affidavit . 
 Chapman left Portland in 1853 for Fort Umpqua in Southern Oregon . There he engaged in cattle ranching while keeping his Portland law practice . He served as a lieutenant colonel in the militia during the Rogue River War that was fought from 1855 to 1856 against the Native Americans in Southern Oregon . After the war he returned to Corvallis in 1856 before moving to Eugene in 1857 . Chapman was appointed as surveyor general of Oregon and served from 1857 to 1861 when he returned to Portland . He left this federal government position due to his opposition to the election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President . Oregon entered the Union as the 33rd state in 1859 . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Upon returning to Portland he built a home at 12th and Jefferson streets in what is now Downtown Portland . Chapman then returned to the practice of law . He also worked to secure Portland ’ s economic future by promoting the construction of the railroad line to California to link with the transcontinental rail line . From 1870 to 1876 he started three companies with the goal of creating a railroad connecting Portland to the Union Pacific ’ s transcontinental railroad . Chapman ’ s proposed line would have traveled through the Columbia River Gorge to The Dalles , Oregon , where it would then travel southeast to Salt Lake City , Utah , linking to the Union Pacific line . 
 In 1868 , he returned to the legislature , representing Multnomah County in the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat . While in the legislature , he worked to get a $ 30 @,@ 000 government subsidy to purchase and operate a large steam tugboat at the mouth of the Columbia River . This vessel was used to pilot ships across the Columbia Bar and thus improved maritime commerce for Portland . In 1870 , he sold two blocks of land in downtown to the City of Portland , which would become the Plaza Blocks between Third and Fourth avenues at Main Street . 
 William Williams Chapman died in Portland on October 18 , 1892 , at the age of 84 , and was buried at Lone Fir Cemetery in that city . Chapman School in Portland was named in his honor . 
 Chapman Square , part of the Plaza Blocks parks with Lownsdale Square , is also named in his honor . The two blocks were purchased from Chapman for $ 1200 . Lownsdale Square contains the Spanish – American War Soldier 's Monument , erected after Harvey W. Scott wrote an editorial pleading for a monument to the war on June 18 , 1899 . The monument includes the statue of a soldier dressed for the Spanish – American War sculpted by Douglas Tilden . While the granite base is inscribed with Roman numerals indicating 1904 , the base was not received until October 1905 , and the monument was not dedicated until May 30 , 1906 , Memorial Day . The final cost of the monument was $ 14 @,@ 722 , paid for by donations following Scott 's plea . The monument also contains two howitzers , donated by Henry E. <unk> , which he found buried in the beach near Fort Sumter . <unk> noted the howitzers had been used by both sides in the American Civil War . There is also a drinking fountain in the square , Fountain for Company H , donated to the city by the Ladies Auxiliary of Company H ( of the 2nd Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment ) . The fountain was a design of John H. Beaver , dedicated on September 2 , 1914 . 
 = Zita of Bourbon @-@ Parma = 
 Zita of Bourbon @-@ Parma ( Zita Maria delle Grazie <unk> Micaela <unk> Gabriella Giuseppina Antonia Luisa <unk> ; 9 May 1892 – 14 March 1989 ) was the wife of Emperor Charles of Austria . As such , she was the last Empress of Austria , Queen of Hungary , and Queen of Bohemia . 
 Born as the seventeenth child of the dispossessed Robert I , Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal , Zita married the then Archduke Charles of Austria in 1911 . Charles became heir presumptive to the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1914 after the assassination of his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , and acceded to the throne in 1916 after the old emperor 's death . 
 After the end of World War I in 1918 , the Habsburgs were deposed when the new countries of Austria , Czechoslovakia , Hungary and the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs were formed . Charles and Zita left for exile in Switzerland and later Madeira , where Charles died in 1922 . After her husband 's death , Zita and her son Otto served as the symbols of unity for the exiled dynasty . A devout Catholic , she raised a large family after being widowed at the age of 29 , and never remarried . 
 Asteroid 689 Zita is named in her honour . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Princess Zita of Bourbon @-@ Parma was born at the Villa Pianore in the Italian Province of Lucca , 9 May 1892 . The unusual name Zita was given her after a popular Italian Saint who had lived in Tuscany in the 13th century . She was the third daughter and fifth child of the deposed Robert I , Duke of Parma and his second wife , Maria Antonia of Portugal , a daughter of king Miguel of Portugal and Adelaide of Löwenstein @-@ Wertheim @-@ Rosenberg . Zita 's father had lost his throne as a result of the movement for Italian unification in 1859 when he was still a child . He fathered twelve children during his first marriage to Maria Pia of the Two Sicilies ( six of whom were mentally retarded , and three of whom died young ) . Duke Robert became a widower in 1882 , and two years later he married Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal , Zita 's mother . The second marriage produced a further twelve children . Zita was the 17th child among Duke Robert 's 24 children . Robert moved his large family between Villa Pianore ( a large property located between <unk> and Viareggio ) and his castle in Schwarzau in lower Austria . It was mainly in these two residences that Zita spent her formative years . The family spent most of the year in Austria moving to Pianore in the Winter and returning in the Summer . To move between them , they took a special train with sixteen coaches to accommodate the family and their belongings . 
 Zita and her siblings were raised to speak Italian , French , German , Spanish , Portuguese and English She recalled , " We grew up internationally . My father thought of himself first and foremost as a Frenchman , and spent a few weeks every year with the elder children at Chambord , his main property on the Loire . I once asked him how we should describe ourselves . He replied , ' We are French princes who reigned in Italy . ' In fact , of the twenty @-@ four children only three including me , were actually born in Italy . 
 At the age of ten , Zita was sent to a boarding school at <unk> in Upper Bavaria , where there was a strict regime of study and religious instruction . She was summoned home in the autumn of 1907 at the death of her father . Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Franziska to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete her education . Brought up as devout Catholics , the Parma children regularly undertook good works for the poor . In Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes . Zita and Franziska personally distributed food , clothing , and medicines to the needy in Pianore . Three of Zita 's sisters became nuns and , for a time , she considered following the same path . Zita went through a patch of poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 In the close vicinity of Schwarzau castle was the Villa <unk> , residence of Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria , Zita ’ s maternal aunt . She was the stepmother of Archduke Otto , who died in 1906 , and the step @-@ grandmother of Archduke Charles of Austria @-@ Este , at that time second @-@ in @-@ line to the Austrian throne . The two daughters of Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria were Zita ’ s first cousins and Charles ’ half @-@ aunts . They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years , as each pursued their education . In 1909 , his Dragoon regiment was stationed at Brandeis an der Elbe ( <unk> on the Elbe ) , from where he visited his aunt at <unk> . It was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted . Charles was under pressure to marry ( Franz Ferdinand , his uncle and first @-@ in @-@ line , had married morganatically , and his children were excluded from the throne ) and Zita had a suitably royal genealogy . Zita later recalled , " We were of course glad to meet again and became close friends . On my side feelings developed gradually over the next two years . He seemed to have made his mind up much more quickly , however , and became even more keen when , in the autumn of 1910 , rumours spread about that I had got engaged to a distant Spanish relative , Don Jaime , the Duke of Madrid . On hearing this , the Archduke came down post haste from his regiment at Brandeis and sought out his grandmother , Archduchess Maria Theresa , who was also my aunt and the natural confidante in such matters . He asked if the rumor was true and when told it was not , he replied , ' Well , I had better hurry in any case or she will get engaged to someone else . ' " 
 Archduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore and asked for Zita ’ s hand and , on 13 June 1911 , their engagement was announced at the Austrian court . Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her worries about the fate of the Austrian Empire and the challenges of the monarchy . Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911 . Charles 's great @-@ uncle , the 81 @-@ year @-@ old Emperor Franz Joseph attended and , relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage , was in good spirits , even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast . Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son , and Otto was born 20 November 1912 . Seven more children would follow in the next decade . 
 = = Wife of the heir to Austrian throne = = 
 At this time , Archduke Charles was in his twenties and did not expect to become emperor for some time , especially while Franz Ferdinand remained in good health . This changed on 28 June 1914 when the heir and his wife Sophie were assassinated in Sarajevo by Bosnian Serb nationalists . Charles and Zita received the news by telegram that day . She said of her husband , " Though it was a beautiful day , I saw his face go white in the sun . 
 In the war that followed , Charles was promoted to General in the Austrian army , taking command of the 20th Corps for an offensive in Tyrol . The war was personally difficult for Zita , as several of her brothers fought on opposing sides in the conflict ( Prince Felix and Prince René had joined the Austrian army , while Prince Sixtus and Prince Xavier lived in France before the war and enlisted in the Belgian army . Also her country of birth , Italy , joined the war against Austria in 1915 , and so rumours of the ' Italian ' Zita began to be muttered . Even as late as 1917 , The German ambassador in Vienna , Count Otto Wedel would write to Berlin saying " The Empress is descended from an Italian princely house ... People do not entirely trust the Italian and her brood of relatives . " 
 At Franz Joseph 's request , Zita and her children left their residence at <unk> and moved into a suite of rooms at Schönbrunn Palace . Here , Zita spent many hours with the old Emperor on both formal and informal occasions , where Franz Joseph confided in her his fears for the future . Emperor Franz Joseph died of bronchitis and pneumonia at the age of 86 on 21 November 1916 . " I remember the dear plump figure of Prince <unk> going up to my husband , " Zita later recounted , " and , with tears in his eyes , making the sign of the cross on Charles 's forehead . As he did so he said , ' May God bless Your Majesty . ' It was the first time we had heard the Imperial title used to us . " 
 = = Empress and Queen = = 
 Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916 . Following the coronation there was a banquet , but after that the festivities ended , as the emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations during a time of war . At the beginning of the reign , Charles was more often than not away from Vienna , so he had a telephone line installed from Baden ( where Charles 's military headquarters were located ) to the Hofburg . He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated . Zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend audiences with the Prime Minister or military briefings , and she had a special interest in social policy . However , military matters were the sole domain of Charles . Energetic and strong @-@ willed , Zita accompanied her husband to the provinces and to the front , as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to the war @-@ wounded . 
 = = = The Sixtus affair = = = 
 By the spring of 1917 , the War was dragging on towards its fourth year , and Zita 's brother Sixtus of Bourbon @-@ Parma , a serving officer in the Belgian Army , was a main mover behind a plan for Austria @-@ Hungary to make a separate peace with France . Charles initiated contact with Sixtus through contacts in neutral Switzerland , and Zita wrote a letter inviting him to Vienna . Zita 's mother Maria Antonia delivered the letter in person . 
 Sixtus arrived with conditions for talks which had been agreed with the French — the restoration to France of Alsace @-@ Lorraine ( annexed by Germany after the Franco @-@ Prussian War in 1870 ) ; restoration of the independence of Belgium ; independence for the kingdom of Serbia ; and the handover of Constantinople to Russia . Charles agreed , in principle , to the first three points and wrote a letter to Sixtus dated 25 March 1917 which sent " the secret and unofficial message " to the President of France that " I will use all means and all my personal influence " . This attempt at dynastic diplomacy eventually foundered . Germany refused to negotiate over Alsace @-@ Lorraine , and , seeing a Russian collapse on the horizon , was loath to give up the war . Sixtus continued his efforts , even meeting Lloyd George in London about Italy 's territorial demands on Austria in the Treaty of London of 1915 , but the Prime Minister could not persuade his generals that Britain should make peace with Austria . Zita managed a personal achievement during this time by stopping the German plans to send airplanes to bomb the home of the King and Queen of Belgium on their name days . 
 In April 1918 , after the German @-@ Russian Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk , Austrian Foreign Minister Count Ottokar Czernin made a speech attacking incoming French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau as being the main obstacle to a peace favouring the Central Powers . Clemenceau was incensed and , after seeing the Emperor Charles 's letter of 24 March 1917 , had it published . For a while , the life of Sixtus appeared to be in danger , and there were even fears that Germany might occupy Austria . Czernin persuaded Charles to send a ' Word of Honour ' to Austria 's allies saying that Sixtus had not been authorised to show the letter to the French Government , that Belgium had not been mentioned , and that Clemenceau had lied about the mentioning of Alsace . Czernin had actually been in contact with the German Embassy throughout the whole crisis and attempted to persuade the Emperor to step down because of the Affair . After failing to do so , Czernin resigned as Foreign Minister . 
 = = = End of Empire = = = 
 By this time , the war was closing in on the embattled Emperor . A Union of Czech Deputies had already sworn an oath to a new Czechoslovak state independent of the Habsburg Empire on 13 April 1918 , the prestige of the German Army had taken a severe blow at the Battle of Amiens , and , on 25 September 1918 , King Ferdinand of Bulgaria broke away from his allies in the Central Powers and sued for peace independently . Zita was with Charles when he received the telegram of Bulgaria 's collapse . She remembered it " made it even more urgent to start peace talks with the Western Powers while there was still something to talk about . On 16 October , the emperor issued a " People 's Manifesto " proposing the empire be restructured on federal lines with each nationality gaining its own state . Instead , each nation broke away and the empire effectively dissolved . 
 Leaving behind their children at <unk> , Charles and Zita travelled to the Schönbrunn Palace . By this time ministers had been appointed by the new state of " German @-@ Austria " , and by 11 November , together with the emperor 's spokesmen , they prepared a manifesto for Charles to sign . Zita , at first glance , mistook it for an abdication and made her famous statement " A sovereign can never abdicate . He can be deposed ... All right . That is force . But abdicate — never , never , never ! I would rather fall here at your side . Then there would be Otto . And even if all of us here were killed , there would still be other Habsburgs ! " Charles gave his permission for the document to be published , and he , his family and the remnants of his Court departed for the Royal shooting lodge at Eckartsau , close to the borders with Hungary and Slovakia . The Republic of German @-@ Austria was pronounced the next day . 
 = = Exile = = 
 After a difficult few months at Eckartsau , the Imperial Family received aid from an unexpected source . Prince Sixtus had met King George V and appealed to him to help the Habsburgs . George was reportedly moved by the request , it being only months since his imperial relatives in Russia had been executed by revolutionaries , and promised " We will immediately do what is necessary . " 
 Several British Army officers were sent to help Charles , most notably Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Edward Lisle Strutt , who was a grandson of Lord Belper and a former student at the University of Innsbruck . On 19 March 1919 , orders were received from the War Office to " get the Emperor out of Austria without delay " . With some difficulty , Strutt managed to arrange a train to Switzerland , enabling the Emperor to leave the country with dignity without having to abdicate . Charles , Zita , their children and their household left Eckartsau on 24 March escorted by a detachment of British soldiers from the Honourable Artillery Company under the command of Strutt . 
 = = = Hungary and exile in Madeira = = = 
 The family 's first home in exile was <unk> Castle in Rorschach , Switzerland , a property owned by the Bourbon @-@ <unk> . However , the Swiss authorities , worried about the implication of the Habsburgs living near the Austrian border , compelled them to move to the western part of the country . The next month , therefore , found them moving to Villa Prangins , near Lake Geneva , where they resumed a quiet family life . This abruptly ended in March 1920 when , after a period of instability in Hungary , Miklós Horthy was elected regent . Charles was still technically King ( as Charles IV ) but Horthy sent an emissary to Prangins advising him not to go to Hungary until the situation had calmed . After the Trianon Treaty Horthy 's ambition soon grew . Charles became concerned and requested the help of Colonel Strutt to get him into Hungary . Charles twice attempted to regain control , once in March 1921 and again in October 1921 . Both attempts failed , despite Zita 's staunch support ( she insisted on travelling with him on the final dramatic train journey to Budapest ) . 
 Charles and Zita temporarily resided at Castle Tata , the home of Count Esterházy , until a suitable permanent exile could be found . Malta was mooted as a possibility , but was declined by Lord Curzon , and French territory was ruled out due to the possibility of Zita 's brothers intriguing on Charles 's behalf . Eventually , the Portuguese island of Madeira was chosen . On 31 October 1921 , the former Imperial couple were taken by rail from Tihany to Baja , where the Royal Navy monitor Glow @-@ worm was waiting . They finally arrived at Funchal on 19 November . Their children were being looked after at <unk> Castle in Switzerland by Charles 's step @-@ grandmother Maria Theresa , although Zita managed to see them in Zurich when her son Robert needed an operation for appendicitis . The children joined their parents in Madeira in February 1922 . 
 = = = Death of Charles = = = 
 Charles had been in poor health for some time . After going shopping on a chilly day in Funchal to buy toys for Carl Ludwig , he was struck by an attack of bronchitis . This rapidly worsened into pneumonia , not helped by the inadequate medical care available . Several of the children and staff were also ill , and Zita ( at the time eight months pregnant ) helped nurse them all . Charles weakened and died on 1 April , his last words to his wife being " I love you so much . " After his funeral , a witness said of Zita " This woman really is to be admired . She did not , for one second , lose her composure ... she greeted the people on all sides and then spoke to those who had helped out with the funeral . They were all under her charm . " Zita wore mourning black in Charles 's memory throughout sixty @-@ seven years of widowhood . 
 = = Widowhood = = 
 After Charles 's death , the former Austrian imperial family were soon to move again . Alfonso XIII of Spain had approached the British Foreign Office via his ambassador in London , and they agreed to allow Zita and her seven ( soon to be eight ) children to relocate to Spain . Alfonso duly sent the warship Infanta Isabel to Funchal and this took them to Cadiz . They were then escorted to the Pardo Palace in Madrid , where shortly after her arrival Zita gave birth to a posthumous child , Archduchess Elisabeth . Alfonso XIII offered his exiled Habsburg relatives the use of Palacio <unk> at Lekeitio in the Bay of Biscay . This appealed to Zita , who did not want to be a heavy burden to the state that harboured her . For the next six years Zita settled in Lekeitio , where she got on with the job of raising and educating her children . They lived with straitened finances , mainly living on income from private property in Austria , income from a vineyard in Johannisberg , and voluntary collections . Other members of the exiled Habsburg dynasty , however , claimed much of this money , and there were regular petitions for help from former Imperial officials . 
 = = = Move to Belgium = = = 
 By 1929 , several of the children were approaching the age to attend university and the family sought to move somewhere of a more congenial educational climate than Spain . That September , they moved to the Belgian village of <unk> near Brussels , where they were closer to several members of their family . Zita continued her political lobbying on behalf of the Habsburg family , even sounding out links with Mussolini 's Italy . There was even a possibility of a Habsburg restoration under the Austrian Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg , with Crown Prince Otto visiting Austria numerous times . These overtures were abruptly ended by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938 . As exiles , the Habsburg family took the lead in resisting the Nazis in Austria , but this foundered because of opposition between monarchists and socialists . 
 = = = Flight to America = = = 
 With the Nazi invasion of Belgium on 10 May 1940 , Zita and her family became war refugees . They narrowly missed being killed by a direct hit on the castle by German bombers and fled to Prince Xavier 's French Castle in <unk> . The Habsburgs then fled to the Spanish border , reaching it on 18 May . They moved on to Portugal where the U.S. Government granted the family exit visas on 9 July . After a perilous journey they arrived in New York on 27 July , having family in Long Island and Newark , New Jersey . ; at one point , Zita and several of her children lived , as long @-@ term house @-@ guests , in Tuxedo Park , New York . 
 The Austrian imperial refugees eventually settled in Quebec , which had the advantage of being French @-@ speaking ( the younger children were not yet fluent in English ) . As they were cut off from all European funds , finances were more stretched than ever . At one stage , Zita was reduced to making salad and spinach dishes from dandelion leaves . However , all her sons were active in the war effort . Otto promoted the dynasty 's role in a post @-@ war Europe and met regularly with Franklin Roosevelt ; Robert was the Habsburg representative in London ; Carl Ludwig and Felix joined the United States Army , serving with several American @-@ raised relatives of the <unk> line ; Rudolf smuggled himself into Austria in the final days of the war to help organise the resistance . In 1945 Empress Zita celebrated her birthday on the first day of peace , 9 May . She was to spend the next two years touring the United States and Canada to raise funds for war @-@ ravaged Austria and Hungary . 
 = = Post @-@ War = = 
 After a period of rest and recovery , Zita found herself regularly going back to Europe for the weddings of her children . She decided to move back to the continent full @-@ time , in 1952 , to Luxembourg , in order to look after her aging mother . Maria Antonia died at the age of 96 in 1959 . The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered ( formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis ) at <unk> , Graubünden in Switzerland . As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family , and a nearby chapel ( a necessity for the devoutly Catholic Zita ) , she accepted with ease . 
 Zita occupied her final years with her family . Although the restrictions on the Habsburgs entering Austria had been lifted , this only applied to those born after 10 April 1919 . This meant Zita could not attend the funeral of her daughter Adelheid in 1972 , which was painful for her . She also involved herself in the efforts to have her deceased husband , the " Peace Emperor " canonised . In 1982 , the restrictions were eased , and she returned to Austria after having been absent for six decades . Over the next few years , the Empress made several visits to her former Austrian homeland , even appearing on Austrian television . In a series of interviews with the Viennese tabloid newspaper <unk> Zeitung , Zita expressed her belief that the deaths of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress Baroness Mary <unk> , at Mayerling , in 1889 , were not a double suicide , but rather murder by French or Austrian agents . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 After a memorable 90th birthday , where she was surrounded by her now vast family , Zita 's strong health began to fail . She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes . Her last big family gathering took place at <unk> , in 1987 , when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita 's 95th birthday . While visiting her daughter , in summer 1988 , she developed pneumonia and spent most of the autumn and winter bedridden . Finally , she called Otto , in early March 1989 , and told him she was dying . He and the rest of the family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989 . She was 96 years old . 
 Her funeral was held in Vienna on 1 April . The government allowed it to take place on Austrian soil providing that the cost was borne by the Habsburgs themselves . Zita 's body was carried to the Imperial Crypt under Capuchin Church in the same funeral coach she had walked behind during the funeral of Emperor Franz Joseph in 1916 . It was attended by over 200 members of the Habsburg and Bourbon @-@ Parma families , and the service had 6 @,@ 000 attendees including leading politicians , state officials and international representatives , including a representative of Pope John Paul II . Following an ancient custom , the Empress had asked that her heart , which was placed in an urn , stay behind at the monastery of <unk> , in Switzerland , where the Emperor 's heart had rested for decades . In doing so , Zita assured herself that , in death , she and her husband would remain by each other 's side . 
 When the procession of mourners arrived at the gates of the Imperial Crypt , the herald who knocked on the door during this traditional " admission ceremony " introduced her as Zita , Her Majesty the Empress and Queen .

 On 10 December 2009 , Mgr Yves Le Saux , Bishop of Le Mans , France , opened the diocesan process for the beatification of Zita . Zita was in the habit of spending several months each year in the diocese of Le Mans at St. Cecilia 's Abbey , <unk> , where three of her sisters were nuns .

 Chau Say Tevoda is a temple at Angkor , Cambodia located just to the northeast of the ancient capital Angkor Thom 's east gate , directly south of <unk> across the Victory Way ( it pre – dates the former and post – dates the latter ) . It is on a road which has the <unk> temple on its opposite side , 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) from the east gate , and a further away by 200 metres ( 660 ft ) to a bridge built with carved stones from temple ruins in the vicinity ; the bridge is without any river flowing beneath it in view of the shifting nature of the course of the Siem Reap River . 
 = = History = = 
 The temple was reconstructed on the basis of several elements ( about 4 @,@ 000 ) of the temple which were randomly lying around at the site . This restoration was done by a Chinese team between 2000 and 2009 under a restoration project sponsored by the People 's Republic of China . Originally this temple was partly built in the mid @-@ 12th century under the reign of King Suryavarman II . Further supplementation of structures was done under the reign of Jayavarman VII . Though the temple was built under Hindu kings during the 11th and 12th centuries with predominantly Hindu deities such as Shiva and Vishnu , representation of Buddha images was interpreted to have been built during the reign of <unk> , father of Jayavarman VII , who ruled from Preah Khan of Kompong . 
 = = Features = = 
 The Tevoda is built to a cruciform plan and linked to an entrance hall , similar to the Hindu temples built in India , particularly in Odisha . The temple has four gopuras or towers on the four cardinal signs with an entrance from the east though a raised bridge . The long hall , which links the gopuras and central chamber of the temple , has very elegant flower decorations . The temple consists of a central tower with an attached mandapa , which is achieved through an antarala chamber of small size , and with two libraries on its southern and northern sides . It is enclosed by a compound wall which has four gopuras or towers . To its east , there is a raised causeway that leads to the Siem Reap River . Many of the sculptures depict Vishnu , and are in a fairly good condition . However , the main deity of the temple is Shiva . Some of the sculptures in the temple are also of Buddha but disfigured totally . With time the ceiling has collapsed and led to further deterioration . The defaced Buddhas , which are deified in a lotus posture , flanked by devotees , are in a mandapa behind a pediment from the entrance door which leads to the antarala . The incomplete eastern Gopura I , which is oriented in the western direction , has a roof which is part of the second " pediment of the lateral southern extension " which is not fully restored . The main figure here is of Buddha in a cross legged posture seated on a high platform and is flanked by disfigured carvings which are interpreted as that of Garuda and the king of Nagas . The top pediment of this Gopura I with figure of Buddha has an umbrella cover of a Bodhi tree . Carvings depicting episodes from the life of Buddha are seen on the northern door of the eastern Gopura I. A notable bass relief here is of Sita ( heroine of the epic Ramayana ) in a seated posture over an altar flanked by rakshasis ( female <unk> ) . Hanuman , in a small monkey form , is carved in sitting posture facing Sita and offering her Rama 's ring . A wall built with laterite stones enclosing the temple , which had existed in the past , has disappeared . 
 The temple was in a dilapidated state with 4 @,@ 000 of its elements lying scattered on the embankment and in the Siem Reap River . Between 2000 to 2009 some of these elements were put together under a restoration project initiated by the People 's Republic of China . The temple reopened in late 2009 and is fully accessible . 
 = Lincoln cent = 
 The Lincoln cent ( or sometimes called Lincoln penny ) is a one @-@ cent coin that has been struck by the United States Mint since 1909 . The obverse or heads side was designed by Victor David Brenner , as was the original reverse . The coin has seen several reverse , or tails , designs and now bears one by Lyndall Bass depicting a Union shield . All coins struck by the United States government with a value of 1 / 100 of a dollar are called cents because the United States has always minted coins using decimals . The penny nickname is a carryover from the coins struck in England which went to decimals for coins in 1971 . 
 In 1905 , sculptor Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens was hired by the Mint to redesign the cent and the four gold coins , which did not require congressional approval . Two of Saint @-@ Gaudens 's proposed designs for the cent were eventually adapted for the gold pieces , but Saint @-@ Gaudens died in August 1907 before submitting additional designs for the cent . In January 1909 , the Mint engaged Brenner to design a cent depicting the late president , Abraham Lincoln , 1909 being the centennial year of his birth . Brenner 's design was eventually approved , and the new coins were issued to great public interest on August 2 , 1909 . 
 Brenner 's initials ( VDB ) , on the reverse at its base , were deemed too prominent once the coins were issued , and were removed within days of the release . The initials were restored , this time smaller , on Lincoln 's shoulder , in 1918 . Brenner 's reverse was replaced in 1959 by a depiction of the Lincoln Memorial designed by Frank Gasparro , for the sesquicentennial of his birth year . The Lincoln Memorial reverse was itself replaced in 2009 by commemorative designs marking the bicentennial of Lincoln 's birth . Beginning in 2010 , Bass 's shield design was coined . Originally struck in 95 % copper , the cent coin was changed for one year to steel in 1943 as copper was needed to aid in the war effort . The mint then reverted to 95 % copper until 1982 , when inflation made copper too expensive and the composition was changed to zinc with an outer copper layer .

 In 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury , Leslie Mortier Shaw , complaining that U.S. coinage lacked artistic merit , and enquiring if it would be possible to engage a private artist , such as sculptor Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens , to prepare new coin designs . At Roosevelt 's instructions , the Mint hired Saint @-@ Gaudens to redesign the cent and the four gold pieces : the double eagle ( $ 20 ) , eagle ( $ 10 ) , half eagle ( $ 5 ) , and quarter eagle ( $ 2 @.@ 50 ) . As the designs of those pieces had remained the same for 25 years , they could be changed without an act of Congress . The Indian Head cent , which the Lincoln cent replaced , had been introduced in 1859 . 
 Saint @-@ Gaudens originally conceived a flying eagle design for the cent , but at Roosevelt 's request , developed it for the double eagle after learning that by law , an eagle could not appear on the cent . Writer and friend Witter Bynner recalled that in January 1907 , Saint @-@ Gaudens was seriously ill with cancer , and was carried to his studio for ten minutes a day to critique the work of his assistants on current projects , including the cent . Saint @-@ Gaudens sent Roosevelt a design in February for the obverse of the cent showing a figure of Liberty . Roosevelt suggested the addition of a Native American war bonnet , stating , " I don 't see why we should not have a conventional head @-@ dress of purely American type for the Liberty figure . " In May 1907 , Roosevelt instructed that the Indian design be developed for the eagle instead . Saint @-@ Gaudens was by then in declining health ; he died on August 3 , 1907 , without having submitted another design for the cent . 
 With the redesign of the four gold denominations completed by 1908 , Roosevelt turned his attention to the cent . The centennial of the birth of assassinated president Abraham Lincoln would occur in February 1909 , and large numbers of privately manufactured souvenirs were already being issued . Many citizens had written to the Treasury Department , proposing a Lincoln coin , and Roosevelt was interested in honoring his fellow Republican . This was a break with previous American numismatic tradition ; before the Lincoln cent , no regularly circulating U.S. coin had featured an actual person ( as opposed to idealized personifications , as of " liberty " ) . Many writers had suggested a Lincoln half dollar , but that coin 's design had been changed in 1892 and could not yet be altered without congressional approval . By then a lame duck in office , Roosevelt was reluctant to involve Congress . 
 In late 1908 , Roosevelt sat for sculptor Victor David Brenner , who was designing a medal for the Panama Canal Commission . While the contents of their conversations were never recorded , it appears they discussed Roosevelt 's plans for coinage redesign . Roosevelt had admired a 1907 plaque of Lincoln which the artist had produced . It is uncertain how Brenner was selected to design the cent , but in January 1909 , Mint Director Frank A. Leach contacted Brenner to ask his fee for designing the coin . Brenner mentioned in his correspondence with Leach that the President had liked his Lincoln design ; there is no evidence Brenner considered any other concept for the piece . 
 = = Design = = 
 Brenner 's obverse design closely follows a profile of Lincoln he had used in other work , such as the desk plaque he made for the Gorham Manufacturing Company in 1907 . Numismatic historian Roger Burdette suggests that Brenner based his work on an 1864 photograph of Lincoln taken at Mathew Brady 's studio by one of his assistants . However , Burdette adds that in an April 1 , 1909 letter , Brenner mentioned that in producing the design , he envisioned Lincoln reading to a child , when the sculptor felt Lincoln would be at his brightest . This suggests that Brenner may have drawn inspiration from the well @-@ known Brady photograph of Lincoln with his son , Tad . In a 2012 study published in Coin World , numismatic historian Fred Reed suggests that Brenner 's Lincoln work was based on a Brady portrait of Lincoln in right profile which was taken on the same day as the picture with his son ( there were several photos taken at this sitting ) . As the photograph in question only showed Lincoln 's head and shoulders , Reed indicates that Brenner obtained additional detail from an 1860 campaign photograph of a beardless Lincoln . 
 On January 18 , 1909 , Brenner submitted models to the Mint with a Lincoln profile on the obverse , and a reverse design very similar to that on the then @-@ current French silver coins , showing a tree branch . He also proposed designs for a Lincoln half dollar , with the late president to appear on one side , and a standing Liberty design — almost identical to the obverse of the same French coins . Leach replied on February 2 that no change to the half dollar could be made without congressional approval . By February 9 , Leach had discovered the origin of the branch design — although numismatic historian Don Taxay notes that it is odd Leach had not discovered the source of the standing Liberty design , given that they were on opposite sides of the same French coins . Leach did not confront the sculptor with the artistic borrowing , but instead simply ruled out the submitted designs as unsuitable for the reverse of the cent . He urged the sculptor to prepare a simple design , bearing the denomination , the country 's name , and the motto " E pluribus unum " . Brenner worked quickly , and on February 17 , delivered models for both obverse and reverse similar to the eventual coin , though with a somewhat larger bust of Lincoln , and the motto " In God We Trust " omitted . As a design element on the reverse , Brenner used two ears of durum wheat . The designs were shown to President Roosevelt , who approved them although Roosevelt required " UNITED " , which Brenner had spelled " <unk> " , to be spelled in the conventional way . After Leach examined the models , he objected to the fact that Brenner had put his full surname on the obverse . Brenner wrote in return , " I shall take it out and put it in small letters on the reverse . " 
 On March 4 , 1909 , the day on which Roosevelt left office , replaced by William Howard Taft , Brenner met with Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber in Philadelphia . Barber had written to Leach , suggesting that Brenner 's designs would have to be modified to be suitable for coinage . On March 15 , Brenner wrote to Leach stating that Barber seemed in no hurry to have the new coins produced . Brenner also complained that the Mint was losing detail as it reduced the large models to coin @-@ sized hubs . Barber had been stung by criticism that he had lost detail in this way with the new gold coins , and he raised no objection to having the reductions done by an outside silversmith . After several hubs were prepared by the Medallic Art Company of New York , Barber sank a master die and sent it to Brenner for retouching . 
 Patterns were prepared from the dies , but Barber and Leach were unhappy with the pieces . On May 22 , Leach wrote to Brenner , 
 I have to inform you that I was not satisfied with the first proof of the Lincoln cent . I found that you had not dropped the Lincoln portrait down so that the head would come nearer the center of the coin ... Therefore I had Mr. Barber make me a proof of this change , and as this left so much blank space over the top we concluded that it would be better to put on the motto , " In God We Trust " . This change has made a marked improvement in the appearance of the coin . 
 On May 26 , samples of the new coin with and without the motto were shown to President Taft , who selected the <unk> version . The coin was formally approved by Secretary of the Treasury Franklin MacVeagh on July 14 and a release date of August 2 , 1909 , was set . 
 = = Release = = 
 The Philadelphia Mint struck 20 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 of the new coin even before its design was made official by Secretary MacVeagh . Dies for the San Francisco Mint , prepared at Philadelphia , were ready for shipment to San Francisco on June 22 . 
 There was intense public interest in the new cents , especially since the Mint had not permitted images of the new coin to be printed in the newspapers . The Lincoln craze sparked by the centennial had not yet subsided , and there was widespread speculation about the coin 's design . The Mint decided to plan for a simultaneous release of the coin across the United States on August 2 , and Treasury Department branches were sent what were thought to be adequate supplies . 
 On the morning of August 2 , 1909 , long lines formed outside Treasury facilities across the United States . Some early applicants were able to obtain all the coins they wanted , but soon the pieces were rationed : applicants at the New York Sub @-@ Treasury were allowed 100 pieces per person ; those who sought the coins at the Philadelphia Mint were allowed only two each . Coins passed on the secondary market outside the Philadelphia Mint for a quarter each until prices settled down to five cents per new penny . Many newsboys were among those who profited from the new coins ; crowds gathered around the windows where the coins were for sale in Washington until order was restored . 
 Brenner 's initials , which he had placed at the base of the reverse , immediately became a source of controversy — on the afternoon of August 2 , The Washington Star queried the Treasury as to the initials . Quotes appeared in the papers from ( possibly invented ) unnamed Treasury officials , opining that the coins were illegal because of the initials , which were seen as advertising . On August 5 , Secretary MacVeagh ordered coinage of the cent suspended until the coins could be struck with an inconspicuous " B " for Brenner on the coin . However , removing the initials and striking new pieces with no initials would lead to a three @-@ day delay in coinage ; effacing the initials and inserting an initial " B " would cause a 14 @-@ day delay . Assistant Treasury Secretary Eliot Norton , after meeting with Barber , ordered that the coins be struck with no initial . Treasury Department Solicitor Maurice O 'Connell held that the exclusion of the initials did not constitute a design change which could only have been implemented by waiting 25 years or obtaining congressional approval . Barber also opposed retaining a single initial " B " , fearing that as he had used an identical initial on his Barber coinage , the new coin would be deemed to be his work , and , according to Norton , " He is not willing to be held personally responsible for the Lincoln penny which he has always opposed and does not regard as a successful coin . " 
 Brenner objected to the removal of his initials , but his protests were to no avail . The cents without Brenner 's initials were in production by August 12 , 1909 . During the halt , owners of vending and slot machines complained that the new pennies were too thick to fit in their machines . Barber was recalled from his vacation in Cape May , New Jersey , to deal with the complaints . Leach ordered changes in the new cent , but Barber resisted Leach 's orders , and was in the end successful — vending and slot machine manufacturers modified their machines to suit the new cent , rather than the other way around . By the end of 1909 , supply of the new cents was finally up to demand . 
 Burdette suggests that had MacVeagh been more experienced in his job , he would have been less concerned about the initials . Saint @-@ Gaudens had prominently signed his double eagle on the obverse , and George T. Morgan 's design for the silver dollar contained an " M " marked on both sides of the piece .

 Cents with and without Brenner 's initials were struck at both Philadelphia and San Francisco in 1909 . Coins struck at Philadelphia bear no mintmark ; those struck at San Francisco were marked with an S. The 1909 @-@ S with Brenner 's initials ( commonly called the 1909 @-@ S VDB ) is the rarest Lincoln cent by date and mintmark , with only 484 @,@ 000 released for circulation . In 1911 , the Denver Mint began striking cents with the mintmark D , and in most years in the following decades , all three mints struck cents . In 1916 , Barber modified the design , causing Lincoln 's cheek and coat to appear less wrinkled . This modification was done to extend die life . 
 In 1917 , a year which saw Barber 's death in office at age 77 , the wartime economy caused a shortage of cents . At this time , the Lincoln cent had not yet become dominant in circulation ; four @-@ fifths of the cents in circulation were of the older Indian Head design . Demand for the cent continued to increase when a luxury tax was instituted , and cents were needed to make change . In 1918 , Brenner 's initials were restored to the coin , appearing where Lincoln 's shoulder is cut off by the rim of the coin . 
 The recession year of 1922 saw a lower @-@ than @-@ usual demand for coins in commerce , and few cents were coined . At the time , dies were only made at Philadelphia ; the Denver Mint had outstanding orders for cents that year . When Denver applied to the Philadelphia Mint for more dies ( cents were not struck at either Philadelphia or San Francisco that year ) , it was told that the Philadelphia Mint could supply no more cent dies , as it was fully engaged in preparing dies for the Peace dollar . Denver filled its orders by striking with a worn @-@ out obverse die , which impressed the design fainter than usual . On many strikes , the mintmark on the die filled with oil and dirt , producing coins on which the mintmark does not appear , or appears only faintly . The 1922 plain piece is another relatively rare one in the Lincoln cent series . 
 When the 25 @-@ year period during which the Lincoln cent could not be changed without congressional approval expired , there was no interest in replacing the design as the coin had remained popular . Beginning in 1936 , proof coins were struck for collectors for the first time since 1916 . Made only at Philadelphia , these pieces were coined from dies polished to mirror smoothness . 
 With the US entry into World War II in 1941 , copper and tin , which were both used in the cent , were in short supply . Experiments were carried out by several corporations under contract from the Mint ; they tested various metallic and non @-@ metallic substances , including fiber , tempered glass , and several types of plastic . These experiments used various designs , since actual Lincoln cent dies could not leave government custody . As the experiments proceeded , production of bronze cents was cut back drastically in July 1942 , and ceased in December . On December 18 , 1942 , Congress gave the mint authorization to change the composition of the cent for a three @-@ year period , and five days later , Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau announced that the coin would be made out of zinc @-@ coated steel . Zinc and iron form an electromagnetic " couple " ; the two metals soon corrode when in contact with each other in a damp atmosphere . The public soon complained that the new coins were becoming spotted and stained . Another common complaint was confusion with the dime , and some letters suggested that a hole be punched in the center of the new coins . Morgenthau responded that the new pieces would soon become darker , and that the Mint would be willing to darken them if it could figure out a suitable process . 
 In December 1943 , the Treasury Department announced that the steel cent would be discontinued after 1943 , to be replaced with coins containing 95 % copper and 5 % zinc ( pre @-@ 1943 cents contained the same percentage of copper but might also contain tin in place of some of the zinc ) . The Treasury also stated that some of the metal for the new coins would be obtained by melting down small arms ammunition shells . However , numismatic writer Shane Anderson , in his study of the Lincoln cent , doubts that any shells were melted down , except perhaps ceremonially . After the war , the Treasury quietly retired as many steel cents as it could from circulation , while denying it was doing so — no public admission of the program was made until 1959 , as the Treasury feared that were it publicly known , the coins would be hoarded . A few 1943 bronze cents and 1944 steel cents are known to exist , and are valuable . Only one 1943 @-@ D cent in bronze is known ; it sold in September 2010 for $ 1 @.@ 7 million . One of the four known 1943 @-@ S cents in bronze was sold to Texas Rangers baseball team co @-@ chairman Bob R. Simpson for $ 1 million . There are also many cents dated 1943 that were coated with copper to imitate the genuine rarity . These pieces may be distinguished from genuine off @-@ metal strikes by the use of a magnet . The planchets from which the 1943 and 1944 off @-@ metal strikes were coined were most likely concealed in the coining equipment and were struck when coinage resumed after year end . The cent returned to its prewar composition in 1946 . 
 In 1952 , the Mint considered replacing the Lincoln cent with a new design by Mint Chief Engraver Gilroy Roberts , but Mint officials feared that the incoming Eisenhower administration would be hostile to replacing a Republican on the cent . Several thousand 1955 pieces were struck with a doubled die , and display doubling of the date . The Mint was aware of the pieces , and knew they were somewhere within a large production lot , but opted to release them , rather than destroy the entire lot . The variety did not become widely known until several years later . 
 = = = Lincoln Memorial design ( 1959 – 2008 ) = = = 
 On Sunday morning , December 21 , 1958 , President Eisenhower 's press secretary , James Hagerty , issued a press release announcing that a new reverse design for the cent would begin production on January 2 , 1959 . The new design , by Frank Gasparro , had been developed by the Treasury in consultation with the Lincoln Sesquicentennial Commission . Approved by the President and by Secretary of the Treasury Robert B. Anderson , the new design featured the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D.C. The redesign came as a complete surprise , as word of the proposal had not been leaked . The coin was officially released on February 12 , 1959 , the 150th anniversary of Lincoln 's birth , although some pieces entered circulation early . 
 The selected design was the result of an internal competition among the Mint 's engravers . Gasparro did not go in person to see the Lincoln Memorial , a place he had never visited . According to Anderson , Gasparro created an " impressive " image of the Memorial , however , Taxay states that the design " looks at first glance like a trolley car " . Numismatic historian Walter Breen describes Gasparro 's design as " an artistic disaster " . 
 There was considerable public excitement over the " small date " and " large date " 1960 and 1960 @-@ D cents , with the small dates being the rarer . The Mint feared the interior of the zero as punched into the die would break away during the coining process , giving the zero a filled @-@ in appearance . To reduce the chance of this happening , the Mint enlarged the date . Sealed bags of 1960 cents , with a face value of $ 50 , sold for as much as $ 12 @,@ 000 . Prices for the small date coins , of which approximately two million had been struck at Philadelphia , continued to increase until 1964 , when the bubble burst . Approximately 500 million of the Denver small date ( out of a total mintage of 1 @.@ 5 billion ) were struck , and are not particularly rare . Bowers points out that there are enough of the 1960 Philadelphia small date known to supply every member of the American Numismatic Association , and every subscriber to the major coin periodicals . 
 In 1964 , a rise in the price of silver led to silver coins being hoarded by the public . With change short , hoarding extended to the cent , which also became scarce in circulation . Mint Director Eva Adams felt that part of the reason for the shortage was coin collectors taking pieces from circulation , and Adams ordered that mintmarks no longer appear on coins . Coins continued to be dated 1964 until the end of 1965 , using authority given by the Coinage Act of 1965 , and almost all 1965 cents were actually struck in 1966 . The Mint began striking clad dimes and quarters , replacing the silver pieces which the public would not spend . Although coinage had been stopped at San Francisco after 1955 , the California facility began to issue cents again , though without mintmarks . In 1968 , mintmarks were restored to the cent . San Francisco began minting a limited number of circulation strikes ( which it would cease to do after 1974 ) and began striking proof coins . 
 Copper prices began to rise in 1973 , to such an extent that the intrinsic value of the coin approached a cent , and citizens began to hoard cents , hoping to realize a profit . The Mint decided to switch to an aluminum cent . Over a million and a half such pieces were struck in the second half of 1973 , though they were dated 1974 . At congressional hearings , representatives of the vending machine industry testified that aluminum cents would jam their equipment , and the Mint backed away from its proposal . Mint director Mary Brooks sought the return of samples which had been distributed to members of Congress , but 14 remained missing , with the recipients affecting not to know what had become of them . One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Numismatic Collection ; another was reportedly found by a US Capitol Police Officer . 
 In 1981 , faced with another rise in the price of copper , the Mint decided to change the composition of the cent to copper @-@ covered zinc . After contract difficulties and production delays , the first such cents were struck at the West Point Mint ( without mintmark ) on January 7 , 1982 . Denver did not convert to the new composition until October 21 . A few pennies were struck by error in brass dated 1983 and are extremely rare . A number of small changes were made to the obverse design in the 1990s and early 2000s .

 The Presidential $ 1 Coin Act of 2005 required that the cent 's reverse be redesigned for 2009 , and that four different designs for the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial be issued . The coins were to be emblematic of Lincoln 's early life in Kentucky and in Indiana , of his professional life in Illinois , and of his presidency . Unveiled September 22 , 2008 , at a ceremony held at the Lincoln Memorial , these designs were : 
 Birth and early childhood in Kentucky : this design features a log cabin . It was designed by Richard Masters and sculpted by Jim <unk> . This penny was released into circulation on Lincoln 's 200th birthday , February 12 , 2009 , at a special ceremony at LaRue County High School in Hodgenville , Kentucky , Lincoln 's birthplace . 
 Formative years in Indiana : this design features a young Lincoln reading while taking a break from rail splitting . It was designed and sculpted by Charles Vickers , and released on May 14 , 2009 . 
 Professional life in Illinois : this design features Lincoln as a young lawyer , standing before the Springfield Illinois State Capitol . It was designed by Joel <unk> and sculpted by Don Everhart . It was made available on August 13 , 2009 . 
 Presidency in Washington , D.C. : this design features the half completed Capitol dome . It was designed by Susan Gamble and sculpted by Joseph Menna . This fourth cent was released to the public on November 12 , 2009 . 
 The law also required that collector 's sets , in the same alloy used in 1909 , be sold to the public .

 The Presidential $ 1 Coin Act required that the cent , beginning in 2010 , " shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln 's preservation of the United States of America as a single and united country " . On April 16 , 2009 , the Commission of Fine Arts ( CFA ) met and recommended a design that showed 13 wheat sheaves bound together with a ring symbolizing American unity as one nation . Subsequently , this design was withdrawn because it was similar to coins issued in Germany in the 1920s . The Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee ( CCAC ) also met and recommended a design showing a Union shield with ONE <unk> superimposed in a scroll ; E pluribus unum was also depicted in the upper portion of the shield . 
 In June 2009 the CFA met again and this time selected a design featuring a modern rendition of the American flag . As a part of the release ceremony for the last of the 2009 cents on November 12 , 2009 , the design for the 2010 cent was announced . The design chosen was the Union shield , that was selected by the CCAC . According to the Mint , the 13 stripes on the shield " represent the states joined in one compact union to support the Federal government , represented by the horizontal bar above . " The new reverse was designed by artist Lyndall Bass and sculpted by US Mint sculptor @-@ engraver Joseph Menna . In January 2010 , the coins were released early in Puerto Rico ; this was prompted by a shortage of cents on the island . The Mint re @-@ engraved the obverse , returning to the original 1909 galvano in preparing new dies . However , the Mint did not return to striking the pieces in the higher relief of 1909 — the piece has long been struck in a much lower relief than the original pieces . Coins of the new design were officially released at a ceremony at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield , Illinois , on February 11 , 2010 . 
 = New York State Route 78 = 
 New York State Route 78 ( NY 78 ) is a 73 @.@ 49 @-@ mile ( 118 @.@ 27 km ) state highway in western New York in the United States . While it is signed north – south , the southern portion runs in an east – west direction across Wyoming and Erie counties , from its beginning at a junction with NY 19 north of the village of Gainesville to the village of East Aurora . The part of the route north of East Aurora follows a generally north – south alignment to an intersection with NY 18 in the Niagara County town of Newfane ( at the hamlet of Olcott ) , just south of the Lake Ontario shoreline . The route is most closely identified in the region with Transit Road , a major north – south trunk road through the center of Erie and Niagara counties ; however , NY 78 does not follow Transit Road for its entire length , nor does Transit Road comprise more than half its length . The highway joins Transit Road north of East Aurora and stays with the road to its end in the city of Lockport . 
 The section of NY 78 between NY 5 in the town of Amherst and the Lake Ontario shoreline in Newfane was originally designated New York State Route 32 in the mid @-@ 1920s . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 32 was absorbed into NY 78 , which ran from Gainesville to Newfane upon assignment . From East Aurora to Depew , NY 78 originally used a slightly more easterly alignment along several local streets and a section of NY 422 . Two realignments in the 1930s moved the route onto its modern alignment , and NY 78 's original routing between East Aurora and Depew was briefly designated NY 78A during the mid @-@ 1930s .

 NY 78 begins at an intersection with NY 19 at the northern end of the Wyoming County village of Gainesville . NY 78 proceeds westward from NY 19 as Delhi Road , a two @-@ lane residential road through the rural sections of Gainesville . At a junction with Dolph Road , NY 78 bends southwest , dropping the Delhi Road moniker , and soon entering the hamlet of Wethersfield , located in the town of the same name . In Wethersfield , NY 78 is a two @-@ lane residential street , intersecting with the northern terminus of County Route 10 ( CR 10 ; Hardys Road ) and southern terminus of CR 4 ( Hermitage Road ) . 
 After the hamlet of Wethersfield , NY 78 continues southwest , crossing through rural farms as a two @-@ lane roadway , intersecting with the southern terminus of CR 57 ( Poplar Tree Road ) . A short distance after CR 57 , NY 78 intersects with the northern terminus of NY 362 while winding southwest through Wethersfield . At the intersection with Maxwell Drive , NY 78 becomes westbound , remaining rural for several miles . After the intersection with Irish Road , NY 78 makes a gradual bend to the southwest , then north . At the end of this bend , NY 78 intersects with the eastern terminus of CR 54 ( Chaffee Road ) and the northern terminus of CR 11 ( East Arcade Road ) . 
 Now in the town of Java , NY 78 uses the right @-@ of @-@ way once used by CR 11 northbound , winding past several farms as it proceeds northward . A short distance to the north , NY 78 intersects with NY 98 southbound . Both NY 78 north and NY 98 south turn west on a wrong @-@ way concurrency through the town of Java , running as a two @-@ lane residential street through dense woods and wide fields . Continuing west through Java , NY 78 and NY 98 cross over a railroad line and enter the hamlet of Java Center . In Java Center , NY 78 and NY 98 intersect with the southern terminus of NY 77 ( Cattaraugus Road ) . This intersection also doubles as the terminus of the NY 78 and NY 98 concurrency as NY 98 proceeds south on NY 77 's right @-@ of @-@ way . 
 NY 78 bends northwest on Main Street and out of Java Center as a two @-@ lane rural roadway through the town of Java . The route soon drops the Main Street moniker , winding northwest into an intersection with CR 44 ( <unk> Road ) . After CR 44 , NY 78 runs northwest as a two @-@ lane residential road , passing numerous houses before intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR 15 ( Holland Road ) . After an intersection with Elm Road , NY 78 regains the Main Street moniker , crossing into the town of Sheldon and into the hamlet of Strykersville . Through Strykersville , NY 78 is a two @-@ lane residential street , intersecting with the western terminus of CR 9 ( Perry Road ) and the southern terminus of CR 35 ( Dutch Hollow Road ) . 
 After CR 35 , NY 78 bends northwest out of Strykersville , crossing into the rural sections of Sheldon surrounding the hamlet . Near the intersection with Chester Street , NY 78 crosses the county line into Erie County and into the town of Wales .

 Now in the Erie County town of Wales , NY 78 changes monikers from Main Street to Strykersville Road , paralleling Buffalo Creek northwest through the rural section of Wales . A short distance northwest , NY 78 intersects with CR 175 ( Center Line Road ) , which connects to the Wyoming County line a short distance east . For a short distance after the intersection , the two routes parallel , with NY 78 bypassing the hamlet of Wales Hollow and intersecting with the northern terminus of CR 387 ( East Creek Road ) . Still known as Strykersville Road , NY 78 parallels Buffalo Creek into the southern terminus of CR 385 ( Schang Road ) . The two @-@ lane rural roadway remains the same for several miles to the northwest , crossing an intersection with CR 382 ( Hunters Creek Road ) . 
 Continuing northwest through Wales , NY 78 remains a two @-@ lane rural street known as Strykersville Road until intersecting with US 20A ( Big Tree Road ) at a T @-@ intersection . US 20A and NY 78 become concurrent along Big Tree , proceeding west through the town of Wales . The routes remain a two @-@ lane residential street for a distance , intersecting with CR 383 ( Reiter Road ) as it winds west . Now in the town of Aurora , US 20A and NY 78 enter a large interchange with NY 400 ( the Aurora Expressway ) . A short distance later , the routes enter the village of East Aurora . Now known as Main Street , US 20A and NY 78 proceed west as a two @-@ lane village street , intersecting with NY 16 ( Olean Road ) and the southern continuation of CR 6 ( Pine Street ) . 
 NY 16 joins the US 20A and NY 78 concurrency as it proceeds west on Main Street , becoming the main commercial thoroughfare through the village . The routes cross over railroad tracks in the center of East Aurora , returning to the residential street it was earlier , which reverts at Center Street . Several blocks to the west , US 20A , NY 16 and NY 78 enter a roundabout at the western end of East Aurora , where US 20A forks southwest on Hamburg Street , while NY 16 and NY 78 join up with CR 572 ( Buffalo Street ) and proceed northwest out of the village . Now in the town of Aurora once again , NY 16 , NY 78 and CR 572 proceed northwest past Knox Farm State Park , <unk> with CR 377 ( <unk> Road ) .

 = = History = = 
 The north – south roadway connecting NY 5 in Amherst to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Olcott via Lockport was originally designated as NY 32 in the mid @-@ 1920s . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 32 became part of NY 78 , a new route extending from Gainesville in the south to Olcott in the north , mostly along existing but previously unnumbered roads . However , the portion between NY 362 and NY 19 was in the process of being built . NY 78 's early routing was identical to its modern alignment except from East Aurora to Depew . Initially , NY 78 headed north from East Aurora to Lancaster by way of Maple Street , Jamison and Bowen roads , and Clinton ( NY 354 ) and Aurora streets before following NY 35 west to Transit Road in Depew . 
 NY 78 was realigned c . 1932 to follow US 20 ( now US 20A ) west from East Aurora to Transit Road , where it turned north onto Transit Road and followed it to Depew . The former routing of NY 78 between East Aurora and Lancaster was redesignated as NY 78A . NY 78 was rerouted one last time c . 1939 to overlap with NY 16 northwest from East Aurora to its junction with Transit Road in West Seneca . The realignment bypassed the southernmost portion of Transit Road , which became NY 187 in the early 1940s . 
 = = NY 78A = = 
 NY 78A was an alternate route of NY 78 in Erie County between NY 78 in East Aurora and NY 35 ( now US 20 ) in Lancaster . The route began at the modern intersection of Main ( then @-@ US 20 ) and Maple streets in East Aurora and followed Maple Street , Jamison and Bowen roads , and Clinton ( NY 354 ) and Aurora streets to a terminus at Broadway ( NY 35 ) in Lancaster . It was assigned c . 1932 after NY 78 was rerouted to follow US 20 and Transit Road instead between East Aurora and Depew . The NY 78A designation was short @-@ lived as it was removed c . 1938 . Its routing is now part of several county routes as well as NY 354 .

 = Jealous ( Beyoncé song ) = 
 " Jealous " is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her fifth studio album , Beyoncé ( 2013 ) . The song was written by Beyoncé , Detail , Andre Eric Proctor , Brian Soko and its additional producers Rasool Diaz and Boots . Musically inspired by Hanni El Khatib 's " Roach Cock " , the song is a power ballad with a slow tempo exploring different styles and music genres . Lyrically , " Jealous " is a self @-@ referential song discussing feelings of jealousy , suspicion , and revenge directed at a present love interest . 
 The song received critical acclaim from music critics who praised Beyoncé for successfully executing its lyrics about vulnerability and insecurity , feelings and states she rarely expressed on her other repertoire . Its experimental composition and production were also well received by critics and compared to works by several other artists as well as the singer 's own material , particularly her song " If I Were a Boy " ( 2008 ) . 
 A music video for the song was directed by Beyoncé along with Francesco Carrozzini and Todd Tours and filmed in New York City in November 2013 . It was released through the iTunes Store on December 13 , 2013 on the album itself . The visual was shot as a sequel to the previous song on the album , " Partition " and it shows Beyoncé in different sets — alone at home waiting for her partner to come to dinner , at a party , and out in the streets in search for him . The video and her character received mostly positive reviews from critics . Beyoncé performed " Jealous " live at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards during a medley consisting of songs from her self @-@ titled album .

 " Jealous " was written by Beyoncé , Detail , Boots , Andre Eric Proctor , Brian Soko , and Rasool Diaz . Beyoncé and Detail also served as its producers with contributions by Boots , Hit @-@ Boy , Hazebanga and Proctor who were credited as additional producers . Beyoncé further served as the vocal producer of the track which also included backing vocals sang by Boots . " Jealous " was recorded in New York City at Jungle City Studios and Oven Studios with guidance from Stuart White . The audio engineering was finished by Ramon Rivas and Rob Suchecki with assistance by Carlos <unk> , while the mixing was done by Tony Maserati at <unk> Studios , North Hollywood , California . All instruments in the song were provided by Boots . 
 " Jealous " was initially conceived when Boots first saw it and the song consisted of " some drums and that synth " . He added a " high " melody containing the lines " If you 're keeping your promise I 'm keeping mine " as he felt it seemed " like a shame something more melodic didn 't happen in the song " . When Beyoncé 's creative team was widely searching for the concept of the song 's music video , the singer sent a clip of a song called " Roach Cock " by Hanni El Khatib to Boots . Inspired by its feel , she requested from him to bring elements of that track to " Jealous " . He added a " gnarly fuzz guitar ripping in the background " to the song also present in its final version . Beyoncé explained the meaning of " Jealous " on her iTunes Radio channel , " [ It 's ] a song about being human . We all get jealous . It doesn 't matter who you are . At some point , it 's just inevitable . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Jealous " is a power ballad , further described as a " silky slow jam " . Consequence of Sound writer Chris Bosman found elements of " slow down radio R & B to molasses <unk> " in its composition . The song opens with distant yelps heard in the background and continues with a slow beat which is distorted and contains an echoing sound throughout . A " wall of crashing sounds " and backing vocals are also heard . " Jealous " further displays " genre diversity , vocal range and a penchant of musical experimentation " while exploring a brooding beat by mixing different tones and styles throughout . Billboard writers Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez found the vibe of the song reminiscent to works by Lana Del Rey , Jeff Bhasker , and Emile Haynie due to its brooding beat . Michael Cragg from The Guardian also compared " Jealous " and its lyrics portraying romance with materials by Del Rey noting that it showed the singer as a " spurned lover " . Chris Kelly of Fact noted that the song 's theme about equality in relationships was similar to her single " If I Were a Boy " ( 2008 ) . The Irish Times editor Una Mullally felt the song offered Robyn @-@ esque sentiments and added that it recalls Beyoncé 's own song , " Halo " ( 2008 ) . Tim Finney from Complex felt that the singer adopted a conversational , " talk @-@ over @-@ the beat " vocal style in the song . Finney argued she adopted that style to convey " unmediated spontaneity or truth @-@ telling " , particularly during the " rueful admission " in the lines , " I know that I 'm being hateful but that ain 't nothin ' . " 
 " Jealous " is a self @-@ referential song as Beyoncé tries to make her love interest envious . Lyrically , the song speaks about " promises , suspicion and potential revenge " . Its lyrics illustrate a woman getting " fierce " when taken for granted as stated by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune . She questions the loyalty of her male love interest and he is believed to be cheating on her with another woman . Claire <unk> of Complex interpreted the song as being about a person fighting with his own feelings of jealousy . She felt that instead of flirting with other people during a night out to make a lover jealous , the protagonist goes for a " downtrodden " direction and reconnects with old people from her past . 
 The song opens with the singer using sexually explicit language to describe an evening at her home where she is cooking a meal for her love interest while being naked and alone , " I 'm in my penthouse half @-@ naked / I cook this meal for you naked " . Idolator 's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer 's " emotional shortcomings " . The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer 's recurring themes present on her other albums — " the empowerment that comes with being a strong , independent woman , and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage " . Finney wrote that during the beginning of the song , Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen , but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone , the same role feels <unk> singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come : " I wish you were me / So you could feel this feeling / I never broke one promise , and I know when you 're not honest . " After the chorus , Beyoncé sings the lines " Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes , do the type of things I never ever do . I take one look in the mirror , and I say to myself , ' Baby girl , you can 't survive like this . ' " The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a " freakum dress out my closet " ( a reference to her own song " Freakum Dress " ( 2006 ) ) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness . As she continues to describe her love – hate relationship detailing her emotions , Beyoncé sings the song 's bridge : 
 And I hate you for your lies and your covers 
 And I hate us for making good love to each other 
 And I love making you jealous but don 't judge me 
 And I know that I 'm being hateful but that ain 't nothing 
 That ain 't nothing 
 I 'm just jealous 
 I 'm just human 
 Don 't judge me 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Jealous " has received critical acclaim . Ludovic Hunter @-@ Tilney from the Financial Times concluded the song was similar to Beyoncé 's previously recorded ballads in the sense that it made her albums " uneven " . However , he argued that " Jealous " had an " intriguing dynamic " between invincibility and vulnerability , with the latter being convincingly executed by the singer for the first time . Editor Caitlin White for the website The 405 found the song to offer a glimpse into the singer 's flaws and insecurities . Similarly , James Montgomery writing for MTV News , felt that the song offered a view of the same states , adding , " she is not always perfect , a point she drives home on tracks like ... ' Jealous ' " . A writer from the website Fuse concluded that the feeling of jealousy expressed in the song were rare for the singer , and added " we didn 't even know [ it ] was an emotion she experienced " . Mesfin Fekadu from the Associated Press noted the song to be " self @-@ explanatory " and found the singer more honest than in her previous work . Kevin Fallon from The Daily Beast found the song 's theme about jealousy to be relatable to many people and different from the rest of the album 's central theme about sex . Claire Lobenfeld of Complex felt " Jealous " took the album from its risqué nature to a " softer side " , further describing it as a " grown @-@ up sequel to ' Freakum Dress ' " . 
 Erika Ramirez and Andrew Hampp of Billboard felt that the song mixed " uncanny " styles and noted that as the chorus starts , listeners " can see Beyonce singing this from the stage surrounded by smoke machines . " USA Today writer Elysa Gardner wrote that in " Jealous " along with " Haunted " , the singer " embodies success and privilege on the surface , but there is a sense that her contentment is fragile " . Entertainment Weekly writer Nick Catucci observed that the song " treat [ s ] relationships with the same raw instinct that suffuses her sex songs " on the album . Writing for Clash magazine , Mike Diver praised Beyoncé 's vocal performance noting , " When Beyoncé truly unleashes her vocals on ballad @-@ tempo moments ... ' Jealous ' , she immediately casts long shadows over singers who might have tried to shift her from the top table of pop " . Mike Wass of Idolator considered " Jealous " to be an update of the singer 's " If I Were a Boy " , sang by a grown woman . He went on to praise the " frank , honest and vulnerable " characteristics the singer decided to showcase in the song , opposed to her other material where she was reluctant to discuss about them . Wass finished his review by noting that " Jealous " would be a " dark horse for a radio single down the line " . Brittany Spanos of The Village Voice described the song as a " grown up version " of " If I Were a Boy " with lyrics about " persistent mistrust " . Latifah Muhammad of BET deemed the song a " distant cousin " to " If I Were a Boy " and stated that its turning point comes during several lines of the bridge . 
 Philip Sherburne of Spin magazine wrote " [ w ] hile we 're getting hyperbolic , ' Jealous ' is the most uplifting take on <unk> " since the song " Suspicious Minds " ( 1968 ) . Jon Pareles , a New York Times writer called it an " accusatory anthem " . Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani described " Jealous " as a " standout " ballad while Rolling Stone 's Jon Dolan hailed it as a " monster " ballad . Nick McCormick of The Daily Telegraph wrote that despite the song lacked a lift off , " there is something impressively dramatic about the restraint she maintains in a song of emotional tension " . Jody Rosen of Vulture , lauded the line " freakum dress out my closet " , but noted , " I want more of a melody from a wronged @-@ woman 's @-@ revenge anthem , but I suspect it 's a grower " . Philadelphia Media Network writer Dan DeLuca gave a more mixed review for the song writing that it was part of the slower material of the album which showed Beyoncé was not flawless . 
 Nolan Feeney of The Atlantic argued that " Jealous " was both one of the album 's best songs and one of singer 's most notable songs overall . Feeney felt that its message was interesting , particularly during the bridge , " It 's not exactly an apology , and it 's not exactly an admission that she 's somehow responsible for her date ( Jay Z , presumably ) not showing . But it is , by my count , only the second time in her solo career that Beyoncé has ever admitted that just maybe it 's she who 's in the wrong . " He went on to say that by moving away from the big and " sweeping " statements present in some of her older material , towards personal narration , Beyoncé managed to effectively examine the themes and statements she explored throughout her career . Feeney concluded by stating : " It 's not a breakup anthem , nor is it a declaration of undying love . It 's angry , it 's introspective , it 's regretful , it 's playful , it 's loving , and it 's everything in between . "

When shooting the scenes on St. Marks , Beyoncé only got out of a car and her crew immediately started filming . Carozzini told MTV News : 
 " We really shot it — some people in the video did not know we were filming . I think the real idea of the video is in a moment like that — in a private moment like that , she can never be by herself ... This song is not about someone who feels those emotions , it 's about Beyoncé feeling those emotions . It 's personal to her . It 's her that cannot be by herself no matter where she goes or what she does , because she 's who she is . "

This catches the attention of their sister , Candace , who desires to inform their mother of their activities to get in trouble . When she finally gets their mother Linda to follow her and view the machine , Linda becomes distracted while Candace continues to walk to the boys , just as their time machine activates . The three are sent back to the Late Cretaceous Period ( erroneously stated to be in 300 million B.C. ) , where a Tyrannosaurus rex immediately destroys the time machine . Now stranded , the three are forced to flee from the T. rex and are eventually saved by a herd of Alamosaurus lounging in a large pond . 
 Meanwhile , Perry the Platypus arrives at Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz 's hideout , where he discovers Doofenshmirtz has gained a new nemesis in the form of Peter the Panda , whom he met in Seattle , Washington . Downtrodden , Perry reminisces about previous battles with Doofenshmirtz when he was his nemesis , while Doofenshmirtz himself grows tired of Peter due to him being much less sympathetic then Perry . Perry and Doofenshmirtz decide to appear on the talk show Dr. <unk> , where they decide to once more become nemeses ; however , Doofenshmirtz reveals that the whole situation was merely a scheme to capture the world 's top agents ( who are in the audience ) and freeze them with a large ray . This results in a largescale battle where the agents come out victorious . 
 The boys and Candace return to a muddy area where the T. rex has left a massive footprint , which they recognize will eventually be on display in the museum in the present . Phineas leaves a message in the footprint for Isabella and the Fireside Girls to save them . The girls — in the present — immediately spot the footprint and the message and follow their handbook to create a new time machine . They use the machine to travel back in time and rescue the three . Upon arrival in the present , though , they realize a T. rex returned with them , so Candace flees and tries to expose it to her parents . A stray ray from Doofenshmirtz 's machine freezes the creature , so her parents merely believe it is an exhibit .

 " It 's About Time ! " was conceived by the series ' four major writers . At a weekly session that Monday , the concept was reviewed and deemed acceptable enough to create . Series co @-@ founder Dan Povenmire was assigned to develop the script , and simultaneously artists Jon Barry , Mike Roth , Kent Osborne , and <unk> <unk> constructed the episode 's storyboards . A walkthrough of the storyboards was presented to the production staff , whose reaction determined whether certain jokes remained in the finished product . Povenmire directed the episode , which was animated at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea . 
 In the conclusion of the episode , Phineas and Ferb 's time machine is left in positive condition and available for further use at the museum . The writing staff purposely ended it this way so that they could <unk> it later in the series . A concept was eventually conceived as a way to do so , having " Phineas and Ferb go into the future and actually see Candace as an adult ( which ) drags up all kinds of memories of not being able to bust them . " This idea was used for the second season episode , " Phineas and Ferb 's Quantum Boogaloo . " 
 " It 's About Time ! " featured two different musical numbers , entitled " My Nemesis " and " When We Didn 't Get Along . " During the storyboard stage , a note was simply made indicating that a song would be placed at a certain point in a sequence . As with most songs in the series , they were each written by series co @-@ founders Povenmire and Jeff " Swampy " Marsh over the course of approximately one hour . Povenmire and Marsh proceeded by singing their draft of the song into the answering machine of the series ' composer , Danny Jacob , that Friday night . Jacob performed both of the songs . 
 The episode was originally broadcast in the United States on the Disney Channel on March 1 , 2008 . " It 's About Time ! " became available on the DVD compilation Phineas and Ferb : The Fast and the Phineas in 2008 , along with fellow first season episodes , " One Good Scare Ought to Do It ! " , " The Fast and the Phineas , " " Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror , " " Flop Starz , " " Raging Bully , " " Lights , Candace , Action ! " and " Are You My Mummy ? " Both " My Nemesis " and " When We Didn 't Get Along " became available in 2009 on the official Phineas and Ferb soundtrack .

 Multiple critics have noted that the portrayal of Doofenshmirtz and Perry 's relationship in the episode features a somewhat of a homosexual subtext . The concept behind it is a parody of stereotypical teen romance film , casting Perry and Doofenshmirtz — two males who are of different species — as the teenage couple who is " breaking up . " Perry 's initial suspicions over Doofenshmirtz having a new nemesis are portrayed as if a person discovers their significant other is cheating on them . Perry discovers a paw print on Doofenshmirtz 's face , resembling a lipstick mark on the cheek as if from a lover , and Peter the Panda emerges from Doofenshmirtz 's closet . Doofenshmirtz initially tries to deny having a new nemesis , but eventually admits to the accusation , noting that he " didn 't want [ Perry ] to find out this way , " overtly detailing a common way couples discover their partner is cheating on them . Perry is depressed about their " break up " and reminisces about their past " relationship " together , while music resembling a love song plays in the background . After feeling depressed himself , Doofenshmirtz " dumps " Peter and reunites with Perry on a talk show prone to featuring romantic confrontations .

 " It 's About Time ! " features multiple cultural references . Aspects of the time machine are based on H.G. Wells ' famous novel The Time Machine . During the " My Nemesis " musical number , caricature of The Archies , a fictional garage band in the animated television series The Archie Show , are shown and begin to sing and play instruments during the course of the sequence . The song itself parodies the style of musician Elvis Costello . The Dr. <unk> show incorporates elements of confrontational talk shows Dr. Phil and The Jerry Springer Show . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The episode was mostly well received by critics . Blogcritics reviewer <unk> Peck applauded the Perry and Doofenshmirtz B @-@ Plot , considering it as both the official Pret episode and an example of the series ' ability to allow " adults [ to ] enjoy the humor " and not strictly focusing on the entertainment of younger viewers . Conversely , Ed Liu of Toon Zone was critical of the episode and other early episodes available on The Fast and the Phineas , calling them " way too manic for their own good , never giving a gag enough time to develop a proper laugh before ripping off to the next one , and refusing to sit still for any length of time . " The production staff reacted positively to the episode , and said that they " really liked " its outcome . 
 Reaction to the episode 's melodies were also positive . Wolfen <unk> wrote in her Sequential Tart article , " Five Reasons : Phineas and Ferb , " that both " My Nemesis " and " When We Didn 't Get Along " were among her personal favorite musical pieces from the series , despite the former resembling the styles of Elvis Costello , whom <unk> noted she carried a distaste for . A Wired magazine review of the series ' soundtrack observed that despite being drastically different from tracks that proceed and precede it , " When We Didn 't Get Along " " fit perfectly " due to " the genius of the malleable songwriting style of Phineas and Ferb 's musical brain trust .

 = Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders = 
 The Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders were a series of federal prosecutions conducted from 1949 to 1958 in which leaders of the Communist Party of the United States ( CPUSA ) were accused of violating the Smith Act , a statute which imposed penalties on those who advocated violent overthrow of the government . The prosecution argued that the CPUSA 's policies promoted violent revolution ; the defendants countered that they advocated a peaceful transition to socialism , and that the First Amendment 's guarantee of freedom of speech and of association protected their membership of a political party . The trials led to the US Supreme Court decisions Dennis v. United States ( 1951 ) and Yates v. United States ( 1957 ) . 
 The first trial , held in New York in 1949 , was one of the lengthiest trials in American history . Large numbers of supporters of the defendants protested outside the courthouse on a daily basis . The trial featured twice on the cover of Time magazine . The defense frequently antagonized the judge and prosecution , and five defendants were jailed for contempt of court because they disrupted the proceedings . The prosecution 's case relied on undercover informants who described the goals of the CPUSA , interpreted communist texts , and testified that they believed the CPUSA advocated the violent overthrow of the US government . 
 While the first trial was under way , events outside the courtroom influenced public perception of communism : the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon , and communists prevailed in the Chinese Civil War . Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants . After a 10 month trial the jury found all 11 defendants guilty and the judge sentenced them to terms of up to five years in federal prison , further sentencing all five defense attorneys to imprisonment for contempt of court . Two of the attorneys were subsequently disbarred . 
 After the first trial , the prosecutors – encouraged by their success – prosecuted over 100 further CPUSA officers for violating the Smith Act . Some were tried solely because they were members of the Party . Many of these defendants had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them . The trials decimated the leadership of the CPUSA . In 1957 , eight years after the first trial , the US Supreme Court 's Yates decision brought an end to similar prosecutions , holding that defendants could be prosecuted only for their actions , not for their beliefs . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the revolution in Russia in 1917 , the communist movement gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world . In Europe and the US , communist parties were formed , generally allied with trade union and labor causes . During the First Red Scare of 1919 – 1920 , many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US . In the late 1930s , state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists , including laws requiring loyalty oaths , and laws requiring communists to register with the government . Even the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , a free @-@ speech advocacy organization , passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks . 
 Following Congressional investigation of left @-@ wing and right @-@ wing extremist political groups in the mid @-@ 1930s , support grew for a statutory prohibition of their activities . The alliance of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in the August 1939 Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact and their invasion of Poland in September gave the movement added impetus . In 1940 the Congress passed the Alien Registration Act of 1940 ( known as the Smith Act ) which required all non @-@ citizen adult residents to register with the government , and made it a crime " to knowingly or willfully advocate ... the duty , necessity , desirability , ... of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence ... with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States .... " Five million non @-@ citizens were fingerprinted and registered following passage of the Act . The first persons convicted under the Smith Act were members of the Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) in Minneapolis in 1941 . Leaders of the CPUSA , bitter rivals of the Trotskyist SWP , supported the Smith Act prosecution of the SWP – a decision they would later regret . In 1943 , the government used the Smith Act to prosecute American Nazis ; that case ended in a mistrial when the judge died of a heart attack . Anxious to avoid alienating the Soviet Union , then an ally , the government did not prosecute any communists under the law during World War II . 
 The CPUSA 's membership peaked at around 80 @,@ 000 members during World War II under the leadership of Earl Browder , who was not a strict Stalinist and cooperated with the US government during the war . In late 1945 , hardliner William Z. Foster took over leadership of the CPUSA , and steered it on a course adhering to Stalin 's policies . The CPUSA was not very influential in American politics , and by 1948 its membership had declined to 60 @,@ 000 members . Truman did not feel that the CPUSA was a threat ( he dismissed it as a " non problem " ) yet he made the specter of communism a campaign issue during the 1948 election . 
 The perception of communism in the US was shaped by the Cold War , which began after World War II when the Soviet Union failed to uphold the commitments it made at the Yalta Conference . Instead of holding elections for new governments , as agreed at Yalta , the Soviet Union occupied several Eastern European countries , leading to a strained relationship with the US . Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that communism posed to Americans : the Stalinist threats in the Greek Civil War ( 1946 – 1949 ) ; the Czechoslovak coup d 'état of 1948 ; and the 1948 blockade of Berlin . 
 The view of communism was also affected by evidence of espionage in the US conducted by agents of the USSR . In 1945 , a Soviet spy , Elizabeth Bentley , repudiated the USSR and provided a list of Soviet spies in the US to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) . The FBI also had access to secret Soviet communications , available from the Venona decryption effort , which revealed significant efforts by Soviet agents to conduct espionage within the US . The growing influence of communism around the world and the evidence of Soviet spies within the US motivated the Department of Justice – spearheaded by the FBI – to initiate an investigation of communists within the US . 
 = = 1949 trial = = 
 In July 1945 , FBI director J. Edgar Hoover instructed his agents to begin gathering information on CPUSA members to support an analysis of the Party 's subversive goals , leading to a 1 @,@ 850 @-@ page report published in 1946 which outlined a case for prosecution . As the Cold War continued to intensify in 1947 , Congress held a hearing at which the Hollywood Ten refused to testify about alleged involvement with the CPUSA , leading to their convictions for contempt of Congress in early 1948 . The same year , Hoover instructed the Department of Justice to bring charges against the CPUSA leaders with the intention of rendering the Party ineffective . John McGohey , a federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York , was given the lead role in prosecuting the case and charged twelve leaders of the CPUSA with violations of the Smith Act . The specific charges against the defendants were first , that they conspired to overthrow the US government by violent means , and second , that they belonged to an organization that advocated the violent overthrow of the government . The indictment , issued on June 29 , 1948 , asserted that the CPUSA had been in violation of the Smith Act since July 1945 . The twelve defendants , arrested in late July , were all members of the National Board of the CPUSA : 
 Benjamin J. Davis , Jr . – Chairman of the CPUSA 's Legislative Committee and Council @-@ member of New York City 
 Eugene Dennis – CPUSA General Secretary 
 William Z. Foster – CPUSA National Secretary ( indicted ; but not tried due to illness ) 
 John Gates – Leader of the Young Communist League 
 Gil Green – Member of the National Board 
 Gus Hall – Member of the CPUSA National Board 
 Irving Potash – <unk> Union official 
 Jack <unk> – Editor of the Daily Worker 
 Robert G. Thompson – Lead of the New York branch of CPUSA 
 John Williamson – Member of the CPUSA Central Committee 
 Henry Winston – Member of the CPUSA National Board 
 Carl Winter – Lead of the Michigan branch of CPUSA 
 Hoover hoped that all 55 members of the CPUSA 's National Committee would be indicted and was disappointed that the prosecutors chose to pursue only twelve . A week before the arrests , Hoover complained to the Justice Department – recalling the arrests and convictions of over one hundred leaders of the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW ) in 1917 – " the IWW was crushed and never revived , similar action at this time would have been as effective against the Communist Party . " 
 = = = Start of the trial = = = 
 The 1949 trial was held in New York City at the Foley Square federal courthouse of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York . Judge Harold Medina , a former Columbia University professor who had been on the bench for 18 months when the hearing began , presided . Before becoming a judge , Medina successfully argued the case of Cramer v. United States before the Supreme Court , defending a German @-@ American charged with treason . 
 The trial opened on November 1 , 1948 , and preliminary proceedings and jury selection lasted until January 17 , 1949 ; the defendants first appeared in court on March 7 , and the case concluded on October 14 , 1949 . Although later trials surpassed it , in 1949 it was the longest federal trial in US history . The trial was one of the country 's most contentious legal proceedings and sometimes had a " circus @-@ like atmosphere " . Four hundred police officers were assigned to the site on the opening day of the trial . Magazines , newspapers , and radio reported on the case heavily ; Time magazine featured the trial on its cover twice with stories titled " Communists : The Presence of Evil " and " Communists : The Little Commissar " ( referring to Eugene Dennis ) . 
 Before the trial began , supporters of the defendants decided on a campaign of letter @-@ writing and demonstrations : the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped . Later , supporters similarly flooded Judge Medina with telegrams and letters urging him to dismiss the charges . During the proceedings , there were days when several thousand picketers protested in Foley Square outside the courthouse , chanting slogans like " Adolf Hitler never died / He 's sitting at Medina 's side " . In response , the US House of Representatives passed a bill in August to outlaw picketing near federal courthouses , but the Senate did not vote on it before the end of the trial . 
 The defense made pre @-@ trial motions arguing that the defendants ' right to trial by a jury of their peers had been denied because , at that time , a potential grand juror had to meet a minimum property requirement , effectively eliminating the less affluent from service . The defense also argued that the jury selection process for the trial was similarly flawed . Their objections to the jury selection process were not successful and jurors included four African Americans and consisted primarily of working @-@ class citizens .

 The opinion of the American public and the news media was overwhelming in favor of conviction . Magazines , newspapers , and radio reported on the case heavily ; Time magazine featured the trial on its cover twice with stories titled " Communists : The Presence of Evil " and " Communists : The Little Commissar " ( referring to Eugene Dennis ) . Most American newspapers supported the prosecution , such as the New York World @-@ Telegram which reported that the Communist Party would soon be punished . The New York Times , in an editorial , felt that the trial was warranted and denied assertions of the Party that the trial was a provocation comparable to the Reichstag fire . The Christian Science Monitor took a more detached view in an editorial : " The outcome of the case will be watched by government and political parties around the world as to how the United States , as an outstanding exponent of democratic government , intends to share the benefits of its civil liberties and yet protect them if and when they appear to be abused by enemies from within " . 
 Support for the prosecutions was not universal , however . During the proceedings , there were days when several thousand picketers protested in Foley Square outside the courthouse , chanting slogans like " Adolf Hitler never died / He 's sitting at Medina 's side " . In response , the US House of Representatives passed a bill in August to outlaw picketing near federal courthouses , but the Senate did not vote on it before the end of the trial . Journalist William L. Shirer was skeptical of the trial , writing " no overt act of trying to forcibly overthrow our government is charged ... The government 's case is simply that by being members and leaders of the Communist Party , its doctrines and tactics being what they are , the accused are guilty of conspiracy " . The Washington Post wrote that the purpose of the government 's legal attack on the CPUSA was " not so much the protection and security of the state as the exploitation of justice for the purpose of propaganda . " Third @-@ party presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace claimed that the trial was an effort by the Truman administration to create an atmosphere of fear , writing " we Americans have far more to fear from those actions which are intended to suppress political freedom than from the teaching of ideas with which we are in disagreement . " Farrell Dobbs of the SWP wrote – despite the fact that the CPUSA had supported Dobbs ' prosecution under the Smith Act in 1941 – " I want to state in no uncertain terms that I as well as the Socialist Workers Party support their struggle against the obnoxious Smith Act , as well as against the indictments under that act " . 
 Before the trial began , supporters of the defendants decided on a campaign of letter @-@ writing and demonstrations : the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped . Later , supporters similarly flooded Judge Medina with telegrams and letters urging him to dismiss the charges . 
 The defense was not optimistic about the probability of success . After the trial was over , defendant Gates wrote : " The anti @-@ communist hysteria was so intense , and most Americans were so frightened by the Communist issue , that we were convicted before our trial even started " . 
 = = = Prosecution = = = 
 Prosecutor John McGohey did not assert that the defendants had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government , but rather alleged that the CPUSA 's philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments . The prosecution called witnesses who were either undercover informants , such as Angela Calomiris and Herbert Philbrick , or former communists who had become disenchanted with the CPUSA , such as Louis Budenz . The prosecution witnesses testified about the goals and policies of the CPUSA , and they interpreted the statements of pamphlets and books ( including The Communist Manifesto ) and works by such authors as Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin . The prosecution argued that the texts advocated violent revolution , and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation , the defendants were guilty of advocating violent overthrow of the government . 
 Calomiris was recruited by the FBI in 1942 and infiltrated the CPUSA , gaining access to a membership roster . She received a salary from the FBI during her seven years as an informant . Calomiris identified four of the defendants as members of the CPUSA and provided information about its organization . She testified that the CPUSA espoused violent revolution against the government , and that the CPUSA – acting on instructions from Moscow – had attempted to recruit members working in key war industries . 
 Budenz , a former communist , was another important witness for the prosecution who testified that the CPUSA subscribed to a philosophy of violent overthrow of the government . He also testified that the clauses of the constitution of the CPUSA that disavowed violence were decoys written in " <unk> language " which were put in place specifically to protect the CPUSA from prosecution . 
 = = = Defense = = = 
 The five attorneys who volunteered to defend the communists were familiar with leftist causes and supported the defendants ' rights to espouse socialist viewpoints . They were Abraham Isserman , George W. Crockett Jr . , Richard Gladstein , Harry Sacher , and Louis F. McCabe . Defendant Eugene Dennis represented himself . The ACLU was dominated by anti @-@ communist leaders during the 1940s , and did not enthusiastically support persons indicted under the Smith Act ; but it did submit an amicus brief endorsing a motion for dismissal of the charges . 
 The defense employed a three @-@ pronged strategy : First , they sought to portray the CPUSA as a conventional political party , which promoted socialism by peaceful means ; second , they attacked the trial as a capitalist venture which could never provide a fair outcome for proletarian defendants ; and third , they used the trial as an opportunity to publicize CPUSA policies . 
 The defense made pre @-@ trial motions arguing that the defendants ' right to trial by a jury of their peers had been denied because , at that time , a potential grand juror had to meet a minimum property requirement , effectively eliminating the less affluent from service . The defense also argued that the jury selection process for the trial was similarly flawed . Their objections to the jury selection process were not successful and jurors included four African Americans and consisted primarily of working @-@ class citizens . 
 A primary theme of the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to socialism by education , not by force . The defense claimed that most of the prosecution 's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre @-@ dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern , after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change . The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA 's advocacy of peace , claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence . Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced . As a result , the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury . 
 The defense attorneys developed a " labor defense " strategy , by which they attacked the entire trial process , including the prosecutor , the judge , and the jury selection process . The strategy involved verbally disparaging the judge and the prosecutors , and may have been an attempt to provoke a mistrial . Another aspect of the labor defense was an effort to rally popular support to free the defendants , in the hope that public pressure would help achieve acquittals . Throughout the course of the trial , thousands of supporters of the defendants flooded the judge with protests , and marched outside the courthouse in Foley Square . The defense used the trial as an opportunity to educate the public about their beliefs , so they focused their defense around the political aspects of communism , rather than rebutting the legal aspects of the prosecution 's evidence . Defendant Dennis chose to represent himself so he could , in his role as attorney , directly address the jury and explain communist principles . 
 = = = Courtroom atmosphere = = = 
 The trial was one of the country 's most contentious legal proceedings and sometimes had a " circus @-@ like atmosphere " . Four hundred police officers were assigned to the site on the opening day of the trial . The defense deliberately antagonized the judge by making a large number of objections and motions , which led to numerous bitter engagements between the attorneys and Judge Medina . Despite the aggressive defense tactics and a voluminous letter @-@ writing campaign directed at Medina , he stated " I will not be intimidated " . Out of the chaos , an atmosphere of " mutual hostility " arose between the judge and attorneys . Judge Medina attempted to maintain order by removing disorderly defendants . In the course of the trial , Medina sent five of the defendants to jail for outbursts , including Hall because he shouted " I 've heard more law in a kangaroo court " , and Winston – an African American – for shouting " more than five thousand Negroes have been lynched in this country " . Several times in July and August , the judge held defense attorneys in contempt of court , and told them their punishment would be meted out upon conclusion of the trial . 
 Fellow judge James L. Oakes described Medina as a fair and reasonable judge , and wrote that " after the judge saw what the lawyers were doing , he gave them a little bit of their own medicine , too . " Legal scholar and historian Michal Belknap writes that Medina was " unfriendly " to the defense , and that " there is reason to believe that Medina was biased against the defendants " , citing a statement Medina made before the trial : " If we let them do that sort of thing [ postpone the trial start ] , they 'll destroy the government " . According to Belknap , Medina 's behavior towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had died of a heart attack during the 1943 trial involving the Smith Act . Some historians speculate that Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him into committing a legal error with the goal of achieving a mistrial . 
 = = = Events outside the courtroom = = = 
 During the ten @-@ month trial , several events occurred in America that intensified the nation 's anti @-@ communist sentiment : The Judith Coplon Soviet espionage case was in progress ; former government employee Alger Hiss was tried for perjury stemming from accusations that he was a communist ( a trial also held at the Foley Square courthouse ) ; labor leader Harry Bridges was accused of perjury when he denied being a communist ; and the ACLU passed an anti @-@ communist resolution . Two events during the final month of the trial may have been particularly influential : On September 23 , 1949 , Truman announced that the Soviet Union detonated its first nuclear bomb ; and on October 1 , 1949 , the Communist Party of China prevailed in the Chinese Civil War . 
 Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis were among the audience members attacked as they left a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill , New York . It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress ( CRC ) , which was funding the defendants ' legal expenses . Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police . Over 140 people suffered injuries , including Potash , whose eyes were struck by glass from a broken windshield . The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries . 
 = = = Convictions and sentencing = = = 
 On October 14 , 1949 , after the defense rested their case , the judge gave the jury instructions to guide them in reaching a verdict . He instructed the jury that the prosecution was not required to prove that the danger of violence was " clear and present " ; instead , the jury should consider if the defendants had advocated communist policy as a " rule or principle of action " with the intention of inciting overthrow by violence " as speedily as circumstances would permit " . This instruction was in response to the defendants , who endorsed the " clear and present danger " test , yet that test was not adopted as law by the Supreme Court . The judge 's instructions included the phrase " I find as a matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil ... " which would later be challenged by the defense during their appeals . After deliberating for seven and one @-@ half hours , the jury returned guilty verdicts against all eleven defendants . The judge sentenced ten defendants to five years and a $ 10 @,@ 000 fine each ( $ 99 @,@ 455 in 2016 dollars ) . The eleventh defendant , Robert G. Thompson – a veteran of World War II – was sentenced to three years in consideration of his wartime service . Thompson said that he took " no pleasure that this Wall Street judicial <unk> has seen fit to equate my possession of the Distinguished Service Cross to two years in prison . " 
 Immediately after the jury rendered a verdict , Medina turned to the defense attorneys saying he had some " unfinished business " and he held them in contempt of court , and sentenced all of them to jail terms ranging from 30 days to six months ; Dennis , acting as his own attorney , was also cited . Since the contempt sentences were based on behavior witnessed by the judge , no hearings were required for the contempt charges , and the attorneys were immediately handcuffed and led to jail . 
 = = = Public reaction = = = 
 The vast majority of the public , and most news media , endorsed the verdict . Typical was a letter to the New York Times : " The Communist Party may prove to be a hydra @-@ headed monster unless we can discover how to kill the body as well as how to cut off its heads . " The day of the convictions , New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey and Senator John Foster Dulles praised the verdicts . 
 Some vocal supporters of the defendants spoke out in their defense . A New York resident wrote : " I am not afraid of communism ... I am only afraid of the trend in our country today away from the principles of democracy . " Another wrote : " the trial was a political trial ... Does not the Soviet Union inspire fear in the world at large precisely because masses of human beings have no confidence in the justice of its criminal procedures against dissidents ? ... I trust that the Supreme Court will be able to correct a grave error in the operation of our political machinery by finding the ... Smith bill unconstitutional . " William Z. Foster wrote : " every democratic movement in the United States is menaced by this reactionary verdict ... The Communist Party will not be dismayed by this scandalous verdict , which belies our whole national democratic traditions . It will carry the fight to the higher courts , to the broad masses of the people . " Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party wrote that the verdict was " a sharp and instant challenge to the freedom of every American . " The ACLU issued a statement reiterating its opposition to the Smith Act , because it felt the act criminalized political advocacy . 
 Abroad , the trial received little mention in mainstream press , but Communist newspapers were unanimous in their condemnation . The Moscow press wrote that Medina showed " extraordinary prejudice " ; the London communist newspaper wrote that the defendants had been convicted only of " being communists " ; and in France , a paper decried the convictions as " a step on the road that leads to war . " 
 On October 21 , President Truman appointed prosecutor John McGohey to serve as a U.S. District Court judge . Judge Medina was hailed as a national hero and received 50 @,@ 000 letters congratulating him on the trial outcome . On October 24 , Time magazine featured Medina on its cover , and soon thereafter he was asked to consider running for governor of New York . On June 11 , 1951 , Truman nominated Medina to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , where he served until 1980 . 
 = = = Bail and prison = = = 
 After sentencing , the defendants posted bail , enabling them to remain free during the appeal process . The $ 260 @,@ 000 bail ( $ 2 @,@ 585 @,@ 818 in 2016 dollars ) was provided by Civil Rights Congress , a non @-@ profit trust fund which was created to assist CPUSA members with legal expenses . While out on bail , Hall was appointed to a position in the secretariat within the CPUSA . Eugene Dennis was – in addition to his Smith Act charges – fighting contempt of Congress charges stemming from an incident in 1947 when he refused to appear before the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee . He appealed the contempt charge , but the Supreme Court upheld his conviction for contempt in March 1950 , and he began to serve a one @-@ year term at that time . 
 While waiting for their legal appeals to be heard , the CPUSA leaders became convinced that the government would undertake the prosecution of many additional Party officers . To ensure continuity of their leadership , they decided that four of the defendants should go into hiding and lead the CPUSA from outside prison . The defendants were ordered to report to prison on July 2 , 1951 , after the Supreme Court upheld their convictions and their legal appeals were exhausted . When July arrived , only seven defendants reported to prison , and four ( Winston , Green , Thompson , and Hall ) went into hiding , forfeiting $ 80 @,@ 000 bail ( $ 795 @,@ 636 in 2016 dollars ) . Hall was captured in Mexico in 1951 , trying to flee to the Soviet Union . Thompson was captured in California in 1952 . Both had three years added to their five @-@ year sentences . Winston and Green surrendered voluntarily in 1956 after they felt that anti @-@ communist hysteria had diminished . Some of the defendants did not fare well in prison : Thompson was attacked by an anti @-@ communist inmate ; Winston became blind because a brain tumor was not treated promptly ; Gates was put into solitary confinement because he refused to lock the cells of fellow inmates ; and Davis was ordered to mop floors because he protested against racial segregation in prison .

 After the convictions , the Cold War continued in the international arena . In December 1950 , Truman declared a national emergency in response to the Korean War . The First Indochina War continued in Vietnam , in which communist forces in the north fought against French Union forces in the south . The US expanded the Radio Free Europe broadcasting system in an effort to promote Western political ideals in Eastern Europe . In March 1951 , American communists Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union . In 1952 , the US exploded its first hydrogen bomb , and the Soviet Union followed suit in 1953 . 
 Domestically , the Cold War was in the forefront of national consciousness . In February 1950 , Senator Joseph McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame when he claimed " I have here in my hand a list " of over 200 communists who were employed in the State Department . In September 1950 , the US Congress passed the McCarran Internal Security Act , which required communist organizations to register with the government , and formed the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate persons suspected of engaging in subversive activities . High @-@ profile hearings involving alleged communists included the 1950 conviction of Alger Hiss , the 1951 trial of the Rosenbergs , and the 1954 investigation of J. Robert Oppenheimer . 
 The convictions in the 1949 trial encouraged the Department of Justice to prepare for additional prosecutions of CPUSA leaders . Three months after the trial , in January 1950 , a representative of the Justice Department testified before Congress during appropriation hearings to justify an increase in funding to support Smith Act prosecutions . He testified that there were 21 @,@ 105 potential persons that could be indicted under the Smith Act , and that 12 @,@ 000 of those would be indicted if the Smith Act was upheld as constitutional . The FBI had compiled a list of 200 @,@ 000 persons in its Communist Index ; since the CPUSA had only around 32 @,@ 000 members in 1950 , the FBI explained the disparity by asserting that for every official Party member , there were ten persons who were loyal to the CPUSA and ready to carry out its orders . Seven months after the convictions , in May 1950 , Hoover gave a radio address in which he declared " communists have been and are today at work within the very gates of America .... Wherever they may be , they have in common one diabolic ambition : to weaken and to eventually destroy American democracy by stealth and cunning . " 
 Other federal government agencies also worked to undermine organizations , such as the CPUSA , they considered subversive : The Internal Revenue Service investigated 81 organizations that were deemed to be subversive , threatening to revoke their tax exempt status ; Congress passed a law prohibiting members of subversive organizations from obtaining federal housing benefits ; and attempts were made to deny Social Security benefits , veterans benefits , and unemployment benefits to communist sympathizers .

 The 1949 trial defendants appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1950 . In the appeal they raised issues about the use of informant witnesses , the impartiality of the jury and judge , the judge 's conduct , and free speech . Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues : they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment , because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence , but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept .

 One of the major issues raised on appeal was that the defendants ' political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment , because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence , but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept . 
 In the early twentieth century , the primary legal test used in the United States to determine if speech could be criminalized was the bad tendency test . Rooted in English common law , the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it had a tendency to harm public welfare . One of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court addressed punishment after material was published was Patterson v. Colorado ( 1907 ) in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies . 
 Anti @-@ war protests during World War I gave rise to several important free speech cases related to sedition and inciting violence . In the 1919 case Schenck v. United States the Supreme Court held that an anti @-@ war activist did not have a First Amendment right to speak out against the draft . In his majority opinion , Justice Holmes introduced the clear and present danger test , which would become an important concept in First Amendment law ; but the Schenck decision did not formally adopt the test . Holmes later wrote that he intended the clear and present danger test to refine , not replace , the bad tendency test . Although sometimes mentioned in subsequent rulings , the clear and present danger test was never endorsed by the Supreme Court as a test to be used by lower courts when evaluating the constitutionality of legislation that regulated speech . 
 The Court continued to use the bad tendency test during the early twentieth century in cases such as 1919 's Abrams v. United States which upheld the conviction of anti @-@ war activists who passed out leaflets encouraging workers to impede the war effort . In Abrams , Holmes and Justice Brandeis dissented and encouraged the use of the clear and present test , which provided more protection for speech . In 1925 's Gitlow v. New York , the Court extended the First Amendment to the states , and upheld the conviction of Gitlow for publishing the " Left Wing Manifesto " . Gitlow was decided based on the bad tendency test , but the majority decision acknowledged the validity of the clear and present danger test , yet concluded that its use was limited to Schenck @-@ like situations where the speech was not specifically outlawed by the legislature . Brandeis and Holmes again promoted the clear and present danger test , this time in a concurring opinion in 1927 's Whitney v. California decision . The majority did not adopt or use the clear and present danger test , but the concurring opinion encouraged the Court to support greater protections for speech , and it suggested that " imminent danger " – a more restrictive wording than " present danger " – should be required before speech can be outlawed . After Whitney , bad tendency tests continued to be used by the Court in cases such 1931 's Stromberg v. California , which held that a 1919 California statute banning red flags was unconstitutional . 
 The clear and present danger test was invoked by the majority in the 1940 Thornhill v. Alabama decision in which a state anti @-@ picketing law was invalidated . Although the Court referred to the clear and present danger test in a few decisions following Thornhill , the bad tendency test was not explicitly overruled , and the clear and present danger test was not applied in several subsequent free speech cases involving <unk> to violence . 
 = = = Appeal to the federal Court of Appeals = = = 
 In May 1950 , one month before the appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case , the Supreme Court ruled on free speech issues in American Communications Association v. Douds . In that case the Court considered the clear and present danger test , but rejected it as too mechanical and instead introduced a balancing test . The federal appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case on June 21 – 23 , 1950 . Two days later , on June 25 , South Korea was invaded by forces from communist North Korea , marking the start of the Korean War ; during the two months that the appeals court judges were forging their opinions , the Korean War dominated the headlines . On August 1 , 1950 , the appeals court unanimously upheld the convictions in an opinion written by Judge Learned Hand . Judge Hand considered the clear and present danger test , but his opinion adopted a balancing approach similar to that suggested in American Communications Association v. Douds . In his opinion , Hand wrote : 
 " In each case they [ the courts ] must ask whether the gravity of the ' evil ' , discounted by its improbability , justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger .... The American Communist Party , of which the defendants are the controlling spirits , is a highly articulated , well contrived , far spread organization , numbering thousands of adherents , rigidly and ruthlessly disciplined , many of whom are infused with a passionate Utopian faith that is to redeem mankind .... The violent capture of all existing governments is one article of the creed of that faith [ communism ] , which <unk> the possibility of success by lawful means . " 
 The opinion specifically mentioned the contemporary dangers of communism worldwide , with emphasis on the Berlin Airlift . 
 = = = Appeal to the Supreme Court = = = 
 The defendants appealed the Second Circuit 's decision to the Supreme Court in Dennis v. United States . During the Supreme Court appeal , the defendants were assisted by the National Lawyers Guild and the ACLU . The Supreme Court limited its consideration to the questions of the constitutionality of the Smith Act and the jury instructions , and did not rule on the issues of impartiality , jury composition , or informant witnesses . The 6 – 2 decision was issued on June 4 , 1951 , and upheld Hand 's decision . Chief Justice Fred Vinson 's opinion stated that the First Amendment does not require that the government must wait " until the putsch is about to be executed , the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited " before it interrupts seditious plots . In his opinion , Vinson endorsed the balancing approach used by Judge Hand : 
 Chief Judge Learned Hand ... interpreted the [ clear and present danger ] phrase as follows : ' In each case , [ courts ] must ask whether the gravity of the " evil " , discounted by its improbability , justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger . ' We adopt this statement of the rule . As articulated by Chief Judge Hand , it is as succinct and inclusive as any other we might devise at this time . It takes into consideration those factors which we deem relevant , and relates their <unk> . More we cannot expect from words . 
 Vinson 's opinion also addressed the contention that Medina 's jury instructions were faulty . The defendants claimed that Medina 's statement that " as matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress has a right to prevent to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution " was erroneous , but Vinson concluded that the instructions were an appropriate interpretation of the Smith Act . 
 The Supreme Court was , in one historian 's words , " bitterly divided " on the First Amendment issues presented by Dennis . Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas dissented from the majority opinion . In his dissent , Black wrote " public opinion being what it now is , few will protest the conviction of these Communist petitioners . There is hope , however , that , in calmer times , when present pressures , passions and fears subside , this or some later Court will restore the First Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society . " Following the Dennis decision , the Court utilized balancing tests for free speech cases , and rarely invoked the clear and present danger test . 
 = = = Appeal of contempt sentences = = = 
 The defense attorneys appealed their contempt sentences , which were handed out by Judge Medina under Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure . The attorneys raised a variety of issues on appeal , including the purported misconduct of the judge , and the claim that they were deprived of due process because there was no hearing to evaluate the merits of the contempt charge . They argued that the contempt charges would prevent future CPUSA defendants from obtaining counsel , because attorneys would be afraid of judicial retaliation . The initial appeal to the federal appeals court was not successful : The court reviewed Medina 's actions , and reversed some specifications of contempt , but affirmed the convictions . The attorneys then appealed to the Supreme Court which denied the initial petition , but later reconsidered and accepted the appeal . The Supreme Court limited their review to the question , " was the charge of contempt , as and when certified , one which the accusing judge was authorized under Rule 42 ( a ) to determine and punish himself ; or was it one to be adjudged and punished under Rule 42 ( b ) only by a judge other than the accusing one and after notice , hearing , and opportunity to defend ? " . The Supreme Court , in an opinion written by Justice Robert Jackson , upheld the contempt sentences by a 5 – 3 vote . Jackson 's opinion stated that " summary punishment always , and rightly , is regarded with disfavor , and , if imposed in passion or pettiness , brings discredit to a court as certainly as the conduct it penalizes . But the very practical reasons which have led every system of law to vest a contempt power in one who presides over judicial proceedings also are the reasons which account for it being made summary . " 
 = = Trials of " second @-@ tier " officials = = 
 After the 1949 convictions , prosecutors waited until the constitutional issues were settled by the Supreme Court before they tried additional leaders of the CPUSA . When the 1951 Dennis decision upholding the convictions was announced , prosecutors initiated indictments of 132 additional CPUSA leaders , called " second string " or " second @-@ tier " defendants . The second @-@ tier defendants were prosecuted in three waves : 1951 , 1954 , and 1956 . Their trials were held in over a dozen cities , including Los Angeles ( 15 CPUSA defendants , including Dorothy Healey , leader of the California branch of the CPUSA ) , New York ( 21 defendants , including National Committee members Claudia Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn ) , Honolulu , Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , Cleveland , Baltimore , Seattle , Detroit , St. Louis , Denver , Boston , Puerto Rico , and New Haven . 
 The second @-@ tier defendants had a difficult time finding lawyers to represent them . The five defense attorneys at the 1949 trial had been jailed for contempt of court , and two of them , Abraham Isserman and Harry Sacher , were disbarred . Attorneys for other Smith Act defendants routinely found themselves attacked by courts , attorneys ' groups , and licensing boards , leading many defense attorneys to shun Smith Act cases . Some defendants were forced to contact over one hundred attorneys before finding one that would accept ; defendant Steve Nelson could not find a lawyer in Pennsylvania who would represent him in his Smith Act trial , so he was compelled to represent himself ; and judges sometimes had to appoint unwilling counsel for defendants who could not find a lawyer to take the case . The National Lawyers Guild provided some lawyers to the defendants , but in 1953 Attorney General Herbert Brownell , Jr. threatened to list the Guild as a subversive organization , causing half its members to leave . 
 Some second @-@ tier defendants were unable to post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress ( CRC ) legal defense fund to provide bail funding . The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants , and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951 . Leaders of the CRC were called before a grand jury and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund . Novelist Dashiell Hammett , a manager of the CRC fund , invoked the Fifth Amendment , refused to identify donors , and was sentenced to six months in prison . 
 To supply witnesses for the second @-@ tier trials , the Justice Department relied on a dozen informants , who traveled full @-@ time from trial to trial , testifying about communism and the CPUSA . The informants were paid for their time ; for example , Budenz earned $ 70 @,@ 000 ( $ 623 @,@ 772 in 2016 dollars ) from his activities as a witness . 
 = = = California convictions reversed = = = 
 The federal appeals courts upheld all convictions of second @-@ tier officials , and the Supreme Court refused to hear their appeals until 1956 , when it agreed to hear the appeal of the California defendants ; this led to the landmark Yates v. United States decision . Fourteen second @-@ tier CPUSA officials from California who had been convicted of Smith Act violations appealed and on June 17 , 1957 , " Red Monday " , the Supreme Court reversed their convictions . By the time the Court ruled 6 – 1 in Yates v. United States , four of the Supreme Court Justices that supported the 1951 Dennis decision had been replaced , including Chief Justice Vinson , who was replaced by Chief Justice Earl Warren .
