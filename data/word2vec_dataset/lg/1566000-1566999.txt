 In the 9th century the territory of modern Belarus became part of Kievan Rus ' , a vast East Slavic state ruled by the Rurikid dynasty . Upon the death of Kievan Rus ' ruler Yaroslav I the Wise , the state split into independent principalities . 
 Many early Russian principalities were virtually razed or severely affected by a major Mongol invasion in the 13th century , but the lands of Belarus avoided the brunt of the invasion and were eventually absorbed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . 
 The Grand Duchy of Lithuania first incorporated Belarusian lands into its territory in 1250 , when it conquered the territories of Polotsk and Navahrudak . 
 Incorporation into The Grand Duchy of Lithuania resulted in an economic , political and ethno @-@ cultural unification of Belarusian lands . Of the principalities held by the Duchy , nine of them were settled by a population that would eventually become Belarusian people . During this time , the Duchy was involved in several military campaigns , including fighting on the side of Poland against the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 ; the joint victory allowed the Duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of Eastern Europe . 
 On 2 February 1386 , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland were joined in a personal union through a marriage of their rulers . This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , created in 1569 . In 1696 , Polish replaced Belarusian as the official language and Belarusian was outlawed . 
 The Muscovites , led by Ivan III of Moscow , began military campaigns in 1486 in an attempt to incorporate the lands of Kievan Rus ' , specifically the territories of Belarus , Russia and Ukraine .

 The union between Poland and Lithuania ended in 1795 with the partitioning of Poland by Imperial Russia , Prussia , and Austria . During this time , the territories of Belarus were acquired by the Russian Empire under the reign of Catherine II and held until their occupation by the German Empire during World War I. 
 Although under Nicholas I and Alexander III the national cultures were repressed due to the policies of de @-@ Polonization and Russification , which included the return to Orthodoxy , the 19th century was signified by the rise of the modern Belarusian nation and self @-@ confidence . 
 In a Russification drive in the 1840s , Nicholas I prohibited the use of Belarusian language in public schools , campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith . In 1863 , economic and cultural pressure exploded into a revolt , led by Kalinowski . After the failed revolt , the Russian government reintroduced the use of Cyrillic to Belarusian in 1864 and no documents in Belarusian were permitted by Russian government until 1905 . 
 During the negotiations of the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk , Belarus first declared independence under German occupation on 25 March 1918 , forming the Belarusian People 's Republic . Immediately afterwards , the Polish – Soviet War ignited , and the territory of Belarus was divided between Poland and the Soviet Russia . 
 = = = Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic = = = 
 A part of Belarus under Russian rule emerged as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Byelorussian SSR ) in 1919 . Soon thereafter it merged to form the Lithuanian @-@ Byelorussian SSR . The contested lands were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union after the war ended in 1921 , and the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922 . The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland . 
 In the 1920s , agricultural reforms that culminated in the Belarusian phase of Soviet collectivization were set in motion . In the 1930s , the implementation of the Soviet five @-@ year plans for the national economy led to rapid industrialization . 
 In 1939 , Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland , marking the beginning of World War II . Much of northeastern Poland , which had been part of the country since the Peace of Riga two decades earlier , was annexed to the Byelorussian SSR , and now constitutes West Belarus . The Soviet @-@ controlled Byelorussian People 's Council officially took control of the territories , whose populations consisted of a mixture of Poles , Ukrainians , Belarusians and Jews , on 28 October 1939 in Białystok . Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 . The Brest Fortress , which had been annexed in 1939 , at this time was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts that happened during the war . Statistically , the Byelorussian SSR was the hardest @-@ hit Soviet republic in World War II ; it remained in Nazi hands until 1944 . During that time , Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic , 85 % of the republic 's industry , and more than one million buildings . 
 Casualties were estimated to be between 2 and 3 million ( about a quarter to one @-@ third of the total population ) , while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during the Holocaust and never recovered . The population of Belarus did not regain its pre @-@ war level until 1971 . It was also after this conflict that the final borders of Belarus were set by Stalin when parts of Belarusian territory were given to the recently annexed Lithuania . 
 After the war , Belarus was among the 51 founding countries of the United Nations Charter and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the UN , on top of the Soviet Union 's vote . Vigorous postwar reconstruction promptly followed the end of the war and the Byelorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in western USSR , creating jobs and attracting ethnic Russians . The borders of the Byelorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn and became known as the Curzon Line . 
 Joseph Stalin implemented a policy of Sovietization to isolate the Byelorussian SSR from Western influences . This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Byelorussian SSR government . The official use of the Belarusian language and other cultural aspects were limited by Moscow . After Stalin 's death in 1953 , Nikita Khrushchev continued his predecessor 's cultural hegemony program , stating , " The sooner we all start speaking Russian , the faster we shall build communism . " 
 In 1986 , the Byelorussian SSR was exposed to significant nuclear fallout from the explosion at the Chernobyl power plant in the neighboring Ukrainian SSR . 
 In June 1988 , the archaeologist and leader of the Christian Conservative Party of the BPF <unk> <unk> discovered mass graves of victims executed in 1937 – 41 at <unk> , near Minsk . Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people , causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence . 
 = = = Independence = = = 
 In March 1990 , elections for seats in the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR took place . Though the pro @-@ independence Belarusian Popular Front took only 10 % of the seats , the populace was content with the selection of the delegates . Belarus declared itself sovereign on 27 July 1990 by issuing the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic . 
 With the support of the Communist Party , the country 's name was changed to the Republic of Belarus on 25 August 1991 . Stanislav Shushkevich , the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus , met with Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid <unk> of Ukraine on 8 December 1991 in <unk> Pushcha to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States . 
 A national constitution was adopted in March 1994 in which the functions of prime minister were given to the President of Belarus .

 Two @-@ round elections for the presidency on ( 24 June 1994 and 10 July 1994 ) catapulted the formerly unknown Alexander Lukashenko into national prominence . He garnered 45 % of the vote in the first round and 80 % in the second , defeating Vyacheslav Kebich who received 14 % of the vote . Lukashenko was re @-@ elected in 2001 , in 2006 , in 2010 and again in 2015 . Western governments , Amnesty International , and Human Rights Watch have criticized Lukashenko 's authoritarian style of government . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Belarus lies between latitudes 51 ° and 57 ° N , and longitudes 23 ° and 33 ° E. Its extension from north to south is 560 km ( 350 mi ) , from west to east is 650 km ( 400 mi ) . It is landlocked , relatively flat , and contains large tracts of marshy land . About 40 % of Belarus is covered by forests . 
 Many streams and 11 @,@ 000 lakes are found in Belarus . Three major rivers run through the country : the Neman , the Pripyat , and the Dnieper . The Neman flows westward towards the Baltic sea and the Pripyat flows eastward to the Dnieper ; the Dnieper flows southward towards the Black Sea . 
 The highest point is <unk> Hara ( <unk> Hill ) at 345 metres ( 1 @,@ 132 ft ) , and the lowest point is on the Neman River at 90 m ( 295 ft ) . The average elevation of Belarus is 160 m ( 525 ft ) above sea level . The climate features mild to cold winters , with average January minimum temperatures ranges from − 4 ° C ( 24 @.@ 8 ° F ) in southwest ( Brest ) to − 8 ° C ( 17 @.@ 6 ° F ) in northeast ( Vitebsk ) , and cool and moist summers with an average temperature of 18 ° C ( 64 @.@ 4 ° F ) . Belarus has an average annual rainfall of 550 to 700 mm ( 21 @.@ 7 to 27 @.@ 6 in ) . The country is in the transitional zone between continental climates and maritime climates . 
 Natural resources include peat deposits , small quantities of oil and natural gas , granite , dolomite ( limestone ) , marl , chalk , sand , gravel , and clay . About 70 % of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine 's 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster entered Belarusian territory , and about a fifth of Belarusian land ( principally farmland and forests in the southeastern regions ) was affected by radiation fallout . The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas , especially through the use of caesium binders and rapeseed cultivation , which are meant to decrease soil levels of caesium @-@ 137 . 
 Belarus borders five countries : Latvia to the north , Lithuania to the northwest , Poland to the west , Russia to the north and the east , and Ukraine to the south . Treaties in 1995 and 1996 demarcated Belarus 's borders with Latvia and Lithuania , but Belarus failed to ratify a 1997 treaty establishing the Belarus @-@ Ukraine border . Belarus and Lithuania ratified final border demarcation documents in February 2007 . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Belarus is a presidential republic , governed by a president and the National Assembly . The term for each presidency is five years . Under the 1994 constitution , the president could serve for only two terms as president , but a change in the constitution in 2004 eliminated term limits . Alexander Lukashenko has been the president of Belarus since 1994 . In 1996 , Lukashenko called for a controversial vote to extend the presidential term from five to seven years , and as a result the election that was supposed to occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001 . The referendum on the extension was denounced as a " fantastic " fake by the chief electoral officer , <unk> <unk> , who was removed from office during the campaign . The National Assembly is a bicameral parliament comprising the 110 @-@ member House of Representatives ( the lower house ) and the 64 @-@ member Council of the Republic ( the upper house ) . 
 The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the prime minister , make constitutional amendments , call for a vote of confidence on the prime minister , and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy . The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials , conduct an impeachment trial of the president , and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives . Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the constitution . 
 The government includes a Council of Ministers , headed by the prime minister and five deputy prime ministers . The members of this council need not be members of the legislature and are appointed by the president . The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court and specialized courts such as the Constitutional Court , which deals with specific issues related to constitutional and business law . The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic . For criminal cases , the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court . The Belarusian Constitution forbids the use of special extrajudicial courts . 
 In the Belarusian parliamentary election , 2012 , 105 of the 110 members elected to the House of Representatives were not affiliated with any political party . The Communist Party of Belarus won 3 seats , and the Agrarian Party and Republican Party of Labour and Justice , one each . Most non @-@ partisans represent a wide scope of social organizations such as workers ' collectives , public associations , and civil society organizations , similar to the composition of the Soviet legislature . 
 = = = Election controversies = = = 
 Neither the pro @-@ Lukashenko parties , such as the Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party and the Republican Party of Labour and Justice , nor the People 's Coalition 5 Plus opposition parties , such as the Belarusian People 's Front and the United Civil Party of Belarus , won any seats in the 2004 elections . Groups such as the Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) declared the election " un @-@ free " because of the opposition parties ' poor results and media bias in favor of the government . 
 In the 2006 presidential election , Lukashenko was opposed by Alaksandar <unk> , who represented a coalition of opposition parties , and by Alaksandar <unk> of the Social Democrats . <unk> was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the All Belarusian People 's Assembly . Lukashenko won the election with 80 % of the vote ; the Russian Federation and the CIS deemed the vote open and fair while the OSCE and other organizations called the election unfair . 
 After the December completion of the 2010 presidential election , Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80 % of the vote in elections . The runner @-@ up opposition leader Andrei Sannikov received less than 3 % of the vote ; independent observers criticized the election as fraudulent . When opposition protesters took to the streets in Minsk , many people , including most rival presidential candidates , were beaten and arrested by the state militia . Many of the candidates , including Sannikov , were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms typically over four years . Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis , activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand @-@ clapping . 
 = = = Corruption = = = 
 The judicial system in Belarus lacks independence and is subject to political interference . Corrupt practices such as bribery often take place during tender processes , and whistleblower protection and national ombudsman are lacking in Belarus 's anti @-@ corruption system . However , there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government , and the government has made some progress in combating corruption , such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office . 
 = = = Human rights = = = 
 Lukashenko has described himself as having an " authoritarian ruling style " . Western countries have described Belarus under Lukashenko as a dictatorship ; the government has accused the same Western powers of trying to oust Lukashenko . The Council of Europe has barred Belarus from membership since 1997 for undemocratic voting and election irregularities in the November 1996 constitutional referendum and parliament by @-@ elections . 
 The Belarusian government is also criticized for human rights violations and its persecution of non @-@ governmental organisations , independent journalists , national minorities , and opposition politicians . In a testimony to the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice labeled Belarus as one of the world 's six " outposts of tyranny " . In response , the Belarusian government called the assessment " quite far from reality " . The <unk> Human Rights Centre lists 11 political prisoners currently detained in Belarus . Among them is the human rights activist Ales <unk> , Vice President of International Federation for Human Rights and head of <unk> . 
 Lukashenko announced a new law in 2014 that will prohibit kolkhoz workers ( around 9 % of total work force ) from leaving their jobs at will — a change of job and living location will require permission from governors . The law was compared with serfdom by Lukashenko himself . Similar regulations were introduced for the forestry industry in 2012 . 
 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 Belarus and Russia have been close trading partners and diplomatic allies since the breakup of the Soviet Union . Belarus is dependent on Russia for imports of raw materials and for its export market . 
 The union of Russia and Belarus , a supranational confederation , was established in a 1996 – 99 series of treaties that called for monetary union , equal rights , single citizenship , and a common foreign and defense policy . However , the future of the union has been placed in doubt because of Belarus 's repeated delays of monetary union , the lack of a referendum date for the draft constitution , and a dispute over the petroleum trade . 
 On 11 December 2007 , reports emerged that a framework for the new state was discussed between both countries . On 27 May 2008 , Belarusian President Lukashenko said that he had named Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin the " prime minister " of the Russia @-@ Belarus alliance . The significance of this act was not immediately clear ; some incorrectly speculated that Putin would become president of a unified state of Russia and Belarus after stepping down as Russian president in May 2008 . 
 Belarus was a founding member of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) ; however , recently other CIS members have questioned the effectiveness of the organization . Belarus has trade agreements with several European Union member states ( despite other member states ' travel ban on Lukashenko and top officials ) , including neighboring Latvia , Lithuania , and Poland . Travel bans imposed by the European Union have been lifted in the past in order to allow Lukashenko to attend diplomatic meetings and also to engage his government and opposition groups in dialogue . 
 Bilateral relations with the United States are strained because the U.S. Department of State supports various anti @-@ Lukashenko non @-@ governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and also because the Belarusian government has made it increasingly difficult for U.S.-based organizations to operate within the country . Diplomatic relations remained tense , and in 2004 , the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act , which authorized funding for anti @-@ government Belarusian NGOs , and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government , except for humanitarian purposes . Despite this political friction , the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection , prevention of human trafficking , technology crime , and disaster relief . 
 Sino @-@ Belarusian relations have improved , strengthened by the visit of President Lukashenko to China in October 2005 . Belarus also has strong ties with Syria , considered a key partner in the Middle East . In addition to the CIS , Belarus is a member of the Eurasian Economic Community , the Collective Security Treaty Organisation , the international Non @-@ Aligned Movement since 1998 , the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , and the UN since its founding in 1945 . As an OSCE member state , Belarus 's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the U.S. Helsinki Commission . 
 Belarus is included in the European Union 's European Neighbourhood Policy ( <unk> ) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer . 
 On 15 February 2016 the European Union announced the easing of sanctions against Belarus during a meeting by 28 EU foreign ministers at a regular session of the Council of the European Union . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 Major General Andrei <unk> heads the Ministry of Defense , and Alexander Lukashenko ( as president ) serves as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . The Armed Forces were formed in 1992 using parts of the former Soviet Armed Forces on the new republic 's territory . The transformation of the ex @-@ Soviet forces into the Armed Forces of Belarus , which was completed in 1997 , reduced the number of its soldiers by 30 @,@ 000 and restructured its leadership and military formations . 
 Most of Belarus 's service members are conscripts , who serve for 12 months if they have higher education or 18 months if they do not . Demographic decreases in the Belarusians of conscription age have increased the importance of contract soldiers , who numbered 12 @,@ 000 in 2001 . In 2005 , about 1 @.@ 4 % of Belarus 's gross domestic product was devoted to military expenditure . 
 Belarus has not expressed a desire to join NATO but has participated in the Individual Partnership Program since 1997 , and Belarus provides refueling and airspace support for the ISAF mission in Afghanistan . Belarus first began to cooperate with NATO upon signing documents to participate in their Partnership for Peace Program in 1995 . However , Belarus cannot join NATO because it is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation . Tensions between NATO and Belarus peaked after the March 2006 presidential election in Belarus . 
 = = = Administrative divisions = = = 
 Belarus is divided into six regions ( Belarusian : <unk> , Russian : о ́ <unk> ) , which are named after the cities that serve as their administrative centers . 
 Each region has a provincial legislative authority , called a region council ( Belarusian : <unk> <unk> <unk> , Russian : <unk> ́ й Сове ́ т <unk> ) , which is elected by its residents , and a provincial executive authority called a region administration ( Belarusian : <unk> <unk> <unk> , Russian : <unk> ́ й <unk> <unk> ́ т ) , whose chairman is appointed by the president . Regions are further subdivided into <unk> , commonly translated as districts ( Belarusian : <unk> , Russian : <unk> ) . 
 Each raion has its own legislative authority , or raion council , ( Belarusian : <unk> <unk> <unk> , Russian : <unk> Сове ́ т <unk> ) elected by its residents , and an executive authority or raion administration appointed by higher executive powers . There are six regions , divided into 118 <unk> . 
 The city of Minsk is split into nine districts and enjoys special status as the nation 's capital . It is run by an executive committee and has been granted a charter of self @-@ rule .

 Most of the Belarusian economy remains state @-@ controlled and has been described as " Soviet @-@ style . " In 2015 , 39 @.@ 3 % of Belarusians were employed by state @-@ controlled companies , 57 @.@ 2 % were employed by private companies ( in which the government has a 21 @.@ 1 % stake ) and 3 @.@ 5 % were employed by foreign companies . The country relies on Russia for various imports , including petroleum . Important agricultural products include potatoes and cattle byproducts , including meat . In 1994 , Belarus 's main exports included heavy machinery ( especially tractors ) , agricultural products , and energy products . 
 Historically , textiles and wood processing have constituted a large part of industrial activity . At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 , Belarus was one of the world 's most industrially developed states by percentage of GDP as well as the richest CIS member @-@ state . Economically , Belarus involved itself in the CIS , Eurasian Economic Community , and Union with Russia . 
 In the 1990s , however , industrial production plunged due to decreases in imports , investment , and demand for Belarusian products from its trading partners . GDP only began to rise in 1996 ; the country was the fastest @-@ recovering former Soviet republic in the terms of its economy . In 2006 , GDP amounted to US $ 83 @.@ 1 billion in purchasing power parity ( PPP ) dollars ( estimate ) , or about $ 8 @,@ 100 per capita . In 2005 , GDP increased by 9 @.@ 9 % ; the inflation rate averaged 9 @.@ 5 % . 
 In 2006 , Belarus 's largest trading partner was Russia , accounting for nearly half of total trade , with the European Union the next largest trading partner , with nearly a third of foreign trade . As of 2015 , 38 % of Belarusian exported goods go to Russia and 56 % of imported goods come from Russia . 
 Due to its failure to protect labor rights , including passing laws forbidding unemployment or working outside of state @-@ controlled sectors , Belarus lost its EU Generalized System of Preferences status on 21 June 2007 , which raised tariff rates to their prior most favored nation levels . Belarus applied to become a member of the World Trade Organization in 1993 . 
 The labor force consists of more than four million people , among whom women hold slightly more jobs than men . In 2005 , nearly a quarter of the population was employed by industrial factories . Employment is also high in agriculture , manufacturing sales , trading goods , and education . The unemployment rate , according to government statistics , was 1 @.@ 5 % in 2005 . There were 679 @,@ 000 unemployed Belarusians , two @-@ thirds of whom were women . The unemployment rate has been in decline since 2003 , and the overall rate of employment is the highest since statistics were first compiled in 1995 . 
 Until July 1st 2016 , the currency of Belarus was the Belarusian ruble ( <unk> ) . The currency was introduced in May 1992 , replacing the Soviet ruble . The first coins of the Republic of Belarus were issued on 27 December 1996 . The ruble was reintroduced with new values in 2000 and has been in use ever since . As part of the Union of Russia and Belarus , both states have discussed using a single currency along the same lines as the Euro . This led to a proposal that the Belarusian ruble be discontinued in favor of the Russian ruble ( <unk> ) , starting as early as 1 January 2008 . The National Bank of Belarus abandoned pegging the Belarusian ruble to the Russian ruble in August 2007 . 
 A new currency , the new Belarusian ruble ( ISO 4217 code : <unk> ) was introduced in July 2016 , replacing the Belarusian ruble in a rate of 1 : 10 @,@ 000 ( 10 @,@ 000 old rubles = 1 new ruble ) . From July 1 until December 31 , 2016 , the old and new currencies will be in parallel circulation and series 2000 notes and coins can be exchanged for series 2009 from January 1 , 2017 to 31 December 2021 . This redenomination can be considered an effort to fight the high inflation rate . 
 The banking system of Belarus consists of thirty state @-@ owned banks and one privatized bank . On 23 May 2011 , the Belarusian ruble depreciated 56 % against the U.S. dollar . The depreciation was even steeper on the black market and financial collapse seemed imminent as citizens rushed to exchange their rubles for dollars , euros , durable goods , and canned goods . On 1 June 2011 , Belarus requested an economic rescue package from the International Monetary Fund .

 According to the government sources , as of November 2011 , 58 @.@ 9 % of all Belarusians adhere to some kind of religion ; out of those , Eastern Orthodoxy ( Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church ) makes up about 82 % . Roman Catholicism is practiced mostly in the western regions , and there are also different denominations of Protestantism . Minorities also practice Greek Catholicism , Judaism , Islam and Neopaganism . 
 Belarus 's Catholic minority , which constitute about 9 % of the country 's population and is concentrated in the western part of the country , especially around Hrodna , is made up of a mixture of Belarusians and the country 's Polish and Lithuanian minorities . In a statement to the media regarding Belarusian @-@ Vatican ties , President Lukashenko stated that Orthodox and Catholic believers are the " two main confessors in our country " . The total Roman Catholic population has dropped to 12 % of religious believers , according to a 2011 report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . 
 Belarus was once a major center of European Jews , with 10 % of the population being Jewish . But since the mid @-@ 20th century , the number of Jews has been reduced by the Holocaust , deportation , and emigration , so that today it is a very small minority of less than one percent . The Lipka Tatars , numbering over 15 @,@ 000 , are predominantly Muslims . According to Article 16 of the Constitution , Belarus has no official religion . While the freedom of worship is granted in the same article , religious organizations deemed harmful to the government or social order can be prohibited .

 The Belarusian government sponsors annual cultural festivals such as the Bazaar in Vitebsk , which showcases Belarusian performers , artists , writers , musicians , and actors . Several state holidays , such as Independence Day and Victory Day , draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades , especially in Vitebsk and Minsk . The government 's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country . 
 Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th @-@ century religious scripture , such as the 12th @-@ century poetry of Cyril of <unk> . 
 By the 16th century , Polotsk resident <unk> <unk> translated the Bible into Belarusian . It was published in Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525 , making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe . The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century ; one prominent writer was <unk> <unk> . Many Belarusian writers of the time , such as <unk> <unk> , Kazimir <unk> , Yakub <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Maksim <unk> , wrote for Nasha Niva , a Belarusian @-@ language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk . 
 After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union , the Soviet government took control of the Republic 's cultural affairs . At first , a policy of " <unk> " was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR . This policy was reversed in the 1930s , and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges . The free development of literature occurred only in Polish @-@ held territory until Soviet occupation in 1939 . Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus and would not return until the 1960s . 
 The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by Vasil <unk> and Uladzimir <unk> . An influential author who devoted his work to awakening the awareness of the catastrophes the country has suffered , was Ales <unk> . He was named by Svetlana <unk> , the Belarusian winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature 2015 , as " her main teacher , who helped her to find a path of her own " . 
 Music in Belarus largely comprises a rich tradition of folk and religious music . The country 's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . In the 19th century , Polish composer Stanisław Moniuszko composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk . During his stay , he worked with Belarusian poet <unk> Dunin @-@ <unk> and created the opera <unk> ( Peasant Woman ) . At the end of the 19th century , major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies . The ballet Nightingale by M. <unk> was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic <unk> Ballet Theatre in Minsk . 
 After the Second World War , music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland . During this period , Anatoly <unk> , creator of the opera In Polesye Virgin Forest , served as the " tutor " of Belarusian composers . The National Academic Theatre of Ballet in Minsk was awarded the Benois de la Dance Prize in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world . Rock music has become increasingly popular in recent years , though the Belarusian government has attempted to limit the amount of foreign music aired on the radio in favor of traditional Belarusian music . Since 2004 , Belarus has been sending artists to the Eurovision Song Contest . 
 Marc Chagall was born in <unk> ( near Vitebsk ) in 1887 . He spent the World War I years in Soviet Belarus , becoming one of the country 's most distinguished artists and a member of the modernist avant @-@ garde and was a founder of the Vitebsk Arts College . 
 = = = Dress = = = 
 The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the Kievan Rus ' period . Due to the cool climate , clothes were designed to preserve body heat and were usually made from flax or wool . They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures : Poles , Lithuanians , Latvians , Russians , and other European nations . Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns . One ornamental pattern common in early dresses currently decorates the hoist of the Belarusian national flag , adopted in a disputed referendum in 1995 . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Belarusian cuisine consists mainly of vegetables , meat ( particularly pork ) , and bread . Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed . Typically , Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals , with dinner being the largest meal of the day . Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus , but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat . To show hospitality , a host traditionally presents an offering of bread and salt when greeting a guest or visitor . 
 = = = Sport = = = 
 Belarus has competed in the Olympic Games since the 1994 Winter Olympics . Its National Olympic Committee has been headed by President Lukashenko since 1997 . 
 Receiving heavy sponsorship from the government , ice hockey is the nation 's second most popular sport after football . The national football team have never qualified for a major tournament , however <unk> Borisov have played in the Champions League . The national hockey team finished fourth in overall competition at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics , and its players have been present in the National Hockey League in North America . Darya Domracheva is a leading biathlete whose honors include three gold medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics . 
 Tennis player Victoria Azarenka became the first Belarusian to win a Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open in 2012 . She also won the gold medal in mixed doubles at the 2012 Summer Olympics with Max Mirnyi , who holds ten Grand Slam titles in doubles . 
 Other notable Belarusian sportspeople include cyclist Vasil Kiryienka , who won the 2015 Road World Time Trial Championship , and middle distance runner <unk> <unk> , who won the gold medal in the 800m at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics .

 In 2008 , there were 3 @.@ 718 million phone landlines used in comparison to 8 @.@ 639 million cellular phones in Belarus . Most of the phone lines are operated by <unk> , a state @-@ owned company . About two @-@ thirds of all of the phone services are run on digital systems , and the mobile @-@ cellular <unk> is about 90 phones per 100 persons . There are approximately 113 @,@ 000 internet hosts in Belarus in 2009 to meet the needs of approximately 3 @.@ 107 million Internet users . 
 The largest media holding group in Belarus is the state @-@ owned National State <unk> . It operates several television and radio stations that broadcast content domestically and internationally , either through traditional signals or the Internet . The Television Broadcasting Network is one of the major independent television stations in Belarus , mostly showing regional programming . Several newspapers , printed either in Belarusian or Russian , provide general information or special interest content , such as business , politics or sports . In 1998 , there were fewer than 100 radio stations in Belarus : 28 AM , 37 FM and 11 shortwave stations . 
 All media companies are regulated by the Law on Press and Other Mass Media , passed on 13 January 1995 . This grants the freedom of press ; however , Article 5 proscribes slander against the President of Belarus or other officials outlined in the national constitution . The Belarusian Government has since been criticized for acting against media outlets . Newspapers such as Nasha Niva and the <unk> <unk> Gazeta have been targeted for closure by the authorities after they published reports critical of President Lukashenko or other government officials . The OSCE and Freedom House have commented regarding the loss of press freedom in Belarus . In 2009 , Freedom House gave Belarus a score of 6 @.@ 75 ( not free ) when it came to dealing with press freedom . Another issue for the Belarusian press is the unresolved disappearance of several journalists .

 = Neotrypaea californiensis = 
 Neotrypaea californiensis ( formerly Callianassa californiensis ) , the Bay ghost shrimp , is a species of ghost shrimp that lives on the Pacific coast of North America . It is a pale animal which grows to a length of 11 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) . One claw is bigger than the other , especially in males , and the enlarged claw is thought to have a function in mating . N. californiensis is a deposit feeder that lives in extensive burrow systems , and is responsible for high rates of bioturbation . It adversely affects oyster farms , and its numbers are controlled in some places by the application of pesticides . It carries out an important role in the ecosystem , and is used by fishermen as bait . 
 = = Description and life cycle = = 
 Neotrypaea californiensis reaches a length of 11 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) . The body is creamy white , with patches of pale colour ( pink , yellow or orange ) on the appendages , and a pink abdomen . 
 Adult N. californiensis have one claw larger than the other , and in the males , the " master claw " can make up as much as 25 % of the animal 's mass – compared to only 10 % in females – with the minor claw making up around 3 % of the total body mass in both sexes . The enlarged claw is equally likely to be on the right side or the left side . The male 's larger claw is thought to be used in agonistic encounters or during mating , and may be the result of sexual selection . 
 Eggs are laid in spring or early summer , and the larvae hatch in summer , living as plankton . They settle to the sea floor again as post @-@ larvae in the late summer and fall . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 N. californiensis was originally described in 1854 by James Dwight Dana as a member of the genus Callianassa , giving the type locality as " California " ; the material Dana studied was probably collected from San Francisco Bay or Monterey , but the original specimens have since been lost . In 1991 , Raymond Manning and Darryl Felder transferred the three species in that genus that come from California and Oregon into the new genus Neotrypaea . N. californiensis is distinguished from the other two species of Neotrypaea by the lack of a rostrum ( which is present in Neotrypaea gigas ) and the acute and diverging tips of the eyestalks ( which are short , blunt and not diverging in Neotrypaea <unk> ) . 
 = = Ecology and human impact = = 
 Both Neotrypaea californiensis and the mud shrimp <unk> <unk> live in mudflats and sandy substrates in the intertidal zone of estuaries in western North America . N. californiensis is found from Mutiny Bay , Alaska to Punta Abreojos , Mulegé , Baja California Sur , Mexico . Its habitat is also used for the aquaculture of the Pacific oyster , Crassostrea gigas . Since the bioturbation carried out by N. californiensis and U. <unk> reduces the productivity of the oyster beds , they are considered pests . Their effects may , however , have knock @-@ on effects across the entire ecosystem , and may buffer it from the hazards of nutrient enrichment and increase primary and secondary productivity by increasing the amount of dissolved inorganic nitrogen . 
 The burrows made by N. californiensis have many branches , and a number of other animals live in them , including snapping shrimp of the genus <unk> , the copepod <unk> <unk> , and the crab <unk> granulata . The gut flora of N. californiensis includes a wide range of bacteria , comprising around 40 % <unk> , 20 % gram @-@ positive bacteria , 20 % in the <unk> – <unk> – Bacteroides group , and 5 % of each of <unk> and Epsilonproteobacteria . Predators of N. californiensis include bottom @-@ dwelling fish and Dungeness crabs ( Metacarcinus magister ) . 
 N. californiensis has a negative impact on oyster production , and as a result , the insecticide <unk> ( 1 @-@ <unk> N @-@ methyl carbamate ) is sprayed in some areas ( including Willapa Bay , Washington ) to reduce the population of N. californiensis . The addition of shelly debris also reduces numbers of N. californiensis both by preventing the settlement of larvae , and through predation on the young N. californiensis by young Dungeness crabs in the shelly debris . 
 N. californiensis is used as fishing bait , and is frequently transported alive between U.S. states , prompting fears that existing population structure may be obliterated , and that it could introduce the castrating parasitic isopod Ione cornuta outside its native range . 
 = D. Djajakusuma = 
 <unk> Djajakusuma ( [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 1 August 1918 – 28 October 1987 ) , generally credited as D. Djajakusuma , was an Indonesian film director and promoter of traditional art forms . Born to a nobleman and his wife in Temanggung , Central Java , Djajakusuma became interested in the arts at a young age , choosing to pursue a career in theatre . During the Japanese occupation from 1943 to 1945 he was a translator and actor , and in the four @-@ year national revolution which followed he worked for the military 's educational division , several news agencies , and in drama . 
 In 1951 , Djajakusuma joined the National Film Corporation ( Perfini ) at the invitation of Usmar Ismail . After making his directorial debut with Embun , Djajakusuma released a further eleven films with the company before leaving in 1964 . He then returned to traditional Indonesian theatre , including wayang . Although he continued to direct movies independently of Perfini , most of his energies were dedicated to promoting traditional art forms and teaching cinematography . After over a decade of poor health and high blood pressure , Djajakusuma collapsed during a ceremony and died . He was buried in <unk> <unk> Cemetery . 
 The dedicated but easily angered Djajakusuma was influenced by Usmar Ismail 's realist views , although he focused more on traditional aspects of life . His theatrical performances attempted to modernise traditional forms so that they could be better received in a modern world . He is credited with revitalising the Betawi theatre form lenong and received numerous awards for his filmmaking , including a lifetime achievement award at the Indonesian Film Festival . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Djajakusuma was born on 1 August 1918 in Parakan , Temanggung , Central Java , Dutch East Indies , to a priyayi father , Raden Mas <unk> <unk> , and his wife <unk> . Djajakusuma was the fifth child of six born to the couple , who lived comfortably off <unk> 's salary as a government official . While young he enjoyed watching stage performances , such as wayang puppetry and the traditional dance form <unk> ; at times he would furtively leave his home after bedtime to watch the productions . With his friends , he would act out the bedtime stories his mother told him . When imported Hollywood films began to be screened , he was an avid viewer , watching Westerns and works starring Charlie Chaplin . 
 Owing to his position as the son of a nobleman , Djajakusuma was able to receive an education . He completed his studies in Semarang , Central Java , graduating from the natural sciences programme at a senior high school there in 1941 . Although his family hoped that he would become a government employee like his father , Djajakusuma decided to go into the performing arts . He returned to his hometown for a short time before realising that he would have little opportunity in Parakan . Accordingly , in early 1943 – almost a year after the Indies were occupied by the Empire of Japan – Djajakusuma moved to the colony 's political centre , Jakarta , to find work . 
 Djajakusuma became employed at the Cultural Centre as a translator and actor under Armijn Pane . Among the works he translated were several pieces by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg and Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen , as well as a history of Japan and several kabuki stage plays . While with the Centre , Djajakusuma wrote several of his own stage plays . In his free time , Djajakusuma helped establish the amateur theatre company Maya , together with artists such as HB Jassin , Rosihan Anwar , and Usmar Ismail . The troupe , formed in response to a desire for greater artistic freedom , performed translations of European works and original works by Ismail and El Hakim . To promote a sense of Indonesian nationalism while still conforming with the Japanese censorship bureau 's rules , several of Maya 's plays did not explicitly promote Japan , but rather the Greater East Asia Co @-@ Prosperity Sphere . Themes supporting the Indonesian nationalist movement , meanwhile , remained implicit in the works . With Maya , Djajakusuma travelled from village to village , putting on performances . 
 = = = Indonesian National Revolution = = = 
 President Sukarno proclaimed Indonesia 's independence on 17 August 1945 , days after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Expecting the Dutch colonial government to return , Djajakusuma and Ismail helped establish the Independent Artists ( <unk> Merdeka ) as a form of resistance . The group travelled throughout the city , spreading news of Indonesia 's proclaimed independence while performing from an open @-@ air truck . After the arrival of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration , the group sometimes attempted to spy on the Europeans or hide information which would be considered useful to the returning Dutch forces . Owing to this dangerous work , Djajakusuma began carrying a pistol , and went to Banten to ask a kyai to make him impervious to bullets . 
 In early 1946 , with the Dutch colonial forces in control of Jakarta , Djajakusuma fled to the new national capital at Yogyakarta . There , he spent a time with the national news agency Antara before joining the military 's educational division , rising to the rank of captain . For the military Djajakusuma edited the weekly Tentara ; he also contributed articles to Ismail 's cultural magazine Arena . Despite his involvement in the press , he did not abandon the theatre ; with <unk> <unk> , he established a troupe which performed for soldiers and raised morale , sometimes travelling to the frontlines . 
 Djajakusuma was hired by the Ministry of Information in 1947 to teach at a school for the performance arts , the Mataram Entertainment Foundation ( Stichting <unk> Mataram ) . Through Mataram , he and Ismail were introduced to filmmakers Andjar Asmara , <unk> , and <unk> ; the two studied under these more established individuals . Meanwhile , Djajakusuma was put in charge of censoring radio broadcasts in Republican @-@ held areas , a duty he held until the Dutch captured Yogyakarta on 19 December 1948 . Djajakusuma fled the city , then met up with Republican forces . Using an old radio and a bicycle @-@ powered generator , Djajakusuma listened to international news broadcasts and wrote them down ; the information from these broadcasts was then printed in underground newspapers . 
 After the Indonesian National Revolution ended with Dutch recognition of Indonesia 's independence in 1949 , Djajakusuma continued to work as a journalist for Patriot ( a rebranding of Tentara ) and the magazine <unk> Nusantara ; Mataram was reopened , and Djajakusuma began teaching there again while managing the <unk> cinema and writing several stage plays . Ismail , meanwhile , went back to Jakarta and established the National Film Corporation ( Perusahaan Film Nasional , or Perfini ) ; its first production , Darah dan Doa ( The Long March ) , which gave a fictionalised version of the Siliwangi Division 's trek from Yogyakarta to West Java in 1948 , was directed by Ismail and released in 1950 . 
 = = = Career with Perfini = = = 
 In preparation for his second film , Enam Djam di Jogja ( Six Hours in Yogyakarta ) , Ismail recalled Djajakusuma to Jakarta . For the film , Djajakusuma helped Ismail adapt the General Assault of 1 March 1949 for the screen . Production was completed on a low budget ; Djajakusuma later recalled that their camera had to be powered by a car battery . Despite this and other difficulties , Djajakusuma stayed on after the film 's completion , completing another work for Perfini , Dosa Tak <unk> ( Unforgivable Sin ) , later that year . Ismail served as director for this film , about a man who leaves his family after he is transfixed by the smile of a waitress . 
 While Ismail , who remained head of Perfini , went abroad to study cinematography at the School of Theater , Film and Television at the University of California , Los Angeles , Djajakusuma began taking a larger role in Perfini . He made his directorial debut in 1952 with Embun ( Dewdrop ) , which showed the psychological troubles faced by soldiers upon returning to their village after the revolution . The film was shot in <unk> , at the time in the middle of a drought , to provide a visual metaphor for the barren souls of the warriors . Because of its depiction of traditional superstitions , the film had trouble with both the censorship bureau and critics ; superstition was considered incompatible with the new republic 's need for modernisation . The release of Embun made Djajakusuma one of four directors to work for Perfini ; the others were Ismail , Nya Abas <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . 
 Djajakusuma 's next production , <unk> <unk> ( Take My Song ; 1952 ) , was a musical about an old , impoverished musician who sells his saxophone to help his former student 's career . Though the film 's technical quality was poor , when he returned to Indonesia in 1953 Ismail was pleased with the work , stating that the editing had been done well . Over the next year Ismail conveyed information he learned at UCLA to the Perfini staff ; Djajakusuma followed these lessons closely . This was followed by Harimau Tjampa ( Tiger from Tjampa ) in 1953 , a film about a man who attempts to avenge his father 's death . Set amidst Minang culture , the film featured some of the first nudity in a domestic production and was a considerable critical success . 
 In 1954 Djajakusuma directed two comedies , Putri dari Medan ( Daughter of Medan ) and <unk> <unk> ( Insane Parents @-@ in @-@ Law ) . The first dealt with three young men who resolve to never marry , only for their strength to waver after meeting some women from Medan , while the second followed a man who rejects his son 's choice of spouse owing to her lack of noble descent , then unknowingly chooses the same woman to be his son 's wife . The following year Djajakusuma helped establish the Indonesian Screen Actors Guild ( Persatuan Artis Film Indonesia ; <unk> ) . His only film that year , the drama Arni , told of a man who married another woman while his sick wife went to Padang , Sumatra , for treatment . 
 Djajakusuma studied cinematography in the United States , first at the University of Washington in Seattle , then at the University of Southern California 's School of Cinematic Arts , from 1956 to 1957 . When he returned to Indonesia , he worked with Ismail and fellow Perfini employee Asrul Sani to establish the National Theatre Academy of Indonesia ( Akademi Teater Nasional Indonesia ) , which promoted realism ; the Indonesian dramatist Putu Wijaya described the realism promoted by the Academy as more Indonesian than Western , while Djajakusuma considered inspired by the Italian neorealist movement . Djajakusuma remained a lecturer with the academy until 1970 , and his students considered him humorous and easy to approach . 
 Upon his return to Indonesia , Djajakusuma began work on Tjambuk Api ( Whips of Fire ; 1958 ) , a critique of the widespread corruption in Indonesia ; this theme led to the film being held by the censorship bureau for almost a year . The director followed this with the drama Pak Prawiro ( Mr. Prawiro ) , which was sponsored by the Post Savings Bank ( Bank <unk> Pos ) and meant to convey the importance of having savings . During this period he studied the traditional theatre of India , travelling to Calcutta , Madras , and New Delhi ; he hoped that this first @-@ hand experience would inspire him in the filming of traditional Indonesian stories . 
 In 1960 Djajakusuma released his first film based on traditional wayang stories , Lahirnja Gatotkatja ; the traditional puppetry had fascinated him as a child , and he greatly enjoyed the character <unk> . Shot in Yogyakarta , the film featured a cast of stars from Jakarta and local talent in backing roles . It was , however , controversial : <unk> and others versed in wayang argued that the director had ignored too many traditional aspects of the puppetry . That year Djajakusuma also served as production manager for Ismail 's Pedjuang ( Warriors for Freedom ) and directed Mak Tjomblang ( Mrs. Tjomblang ) , a comedy adapted from Nikolai Gogol 's 1842 drama Marriage . 
 Djajakusuma released another comedy , Masa <unk> dan Badai ( Time of Cyclones and Storms ) , in 1963 ; the film centres around the family dynamics of a conservative father , liberal mother , and their two teenaged daughters who are in the throes of adolescence . The following year Djajakusuma directed his last film with Perfini , Rimba <unk> ( Echoing Jungles ) , which was meant to promote the nation 's rubber industry . That year he helped establish the Film and TV Employee 's Union ( Persatuan <unk> Film dan TV ) , a response to the Lekra @-@ sponsored Indonesian Film League . As with Ismail and most Perfini employees , Djajakusuma was staunchly against the communist @-@ affiliated Lekra ; the cultural group was likewise hostile towards those affiliated with Perfini . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 Towards the end of his time with Perfini , Djajakusuma again became active in traditional arts . He devoted considerable time towards the promotion of wayang . In 1967 he organised the National Wayang Festival , which collapsed shortly afterwards owing to a lack of funds . In 1967 he directed the wayang @-@ inspired film Bimo Kroda for <unk> Murti Film , which used the destruction of the <unk> – brothers in the Hindu epic Mahābhārata – to represent the kidnappings and subsequent murders of five army generals during the 30 September Movement in 1965 . Djajakusuma 's involvement with wayang continued into the early 1970s ; he organised two Wayang Weeks , in 1970 and 1974 , as well as a national wayang festival in 1977 . Furthermore , he established two wayang orang troupes , Jaya Budaya ( 1971 ) and Bharata ( 1973 ) , hoping to save the ailing medium by modernising it . 
 Meanwhile , Djajakusuma helped promote art forms such as the Betawi lenong and Javanese <unk> over a period of several years . He is particularly recognised for his revitalising lenong . Beginning in 1968 , Djajakusuma appeared on television as an advocate of lenong , which was then limited to rural villages and on the verge of dying out . He increased popular knowledge of the form while arguing for proper remuneration for performers . Through the 1970s lenong was performed at Ismail Marzuki Hall , drawing considerable audiences , and several lenong performers found mainstream acclaim in the film industry . 
 Djajakusuma also promoted non @-@ traditional cultural activities , both modern and foreign . In 1968 he became the head of the Jakarta Art Council , a position he held until 1977 , and in 1970 he held a kroncong music festival . Beginning with the school 's establishment in 1970 , he became a lecturer at the Jakarta Institute for Arts Education ( Lembaga Pendidikan Kesenian Jakarta , later the Jakarta Art Institute [ Institut Kesenian Jakarta , or IKJ ] ) , teaching cinematography . To better understand the world 's theatre , in 1977 he went to Japan and China to study their traditions . He later led the students in various stage performances , including adaptations of Japanese noh and Chinese opera ; several of these performances were held at Ismail Marzuki Hall . In the 1970s Djajakusuma held a variety of positions in film organisations , including as a member of the Film Council ( 1974 – 76 ) , a member of the Board of Trustees for Radio and TV Broadcasts ( 1976 ) , and a member of the Bureau for the Development of National Film ( 1977 – 78 ) . 
 Djajakusuma 's productivity in the film industry , however , declined . In 1971 he directed his final films , Api di Bukit Menoreh ( Fire on Mount Menoreh ) and Malin Kundang ( Anak <unk> ) ( Malin Kundang [ Faithless Child ] ) . The first , released for Penas Film Studio and based on a novel by <unk> Hadi <unk> , followed soldiers from the Kingdom of <unk> in their efforts to subdue soldiers from the rival kingdom of <unk> . The second film was an adaptation of the Malay folktale of the same name . Starring Rano Karno and Putu Wijaya as the title character , the film follows a young boy who forgets his roots after spending much of his childhood at sea . His last role as a filmmaker was in 1977 , when he helped produce Fritz G. Schadt 's comedy Bang Kojak ( Brother Kojak ; 1977 ) . 
 = = = Final years and death = = = 
 In 1977 Djajakusuma served on the jury of the Indonesian Film Festival ( Festival Film Indonesia , or FFI ) . While reading the decision , he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital , while Rosihan Anwar completed the reading . Djajakusuma 's neighbour and frequent collaborator Taufiq Ismail told reporters that it was not the first time Djajakusuma had collapsed . Djajakusuma continued to suffer from bouts of sudden weakness for the rest of his life , caused by high blood pressure . 
 Despite his rapidly failing health , Djajakusuma remained active in the arts . In 1980 he made his last film appearance , and his only role on the big screen , acting in Ismail <unk> 's Perempuan dalam Pasungan ( Woman in Stocks ) . He and Sofia WD portrayed parents who regularly put their daughter in stocks to punish her for being disobedient ; in an interview with Suara Karya , <unk> recalled that , from the time he had written it , he had only considered Djajakusuma for the role . Perempuan dalam Pasungan won the Citra Award for Best Film at the 1981 Indonesian Film Festival , and Djajakusuma expressed an interest in making several further films ; this was , however , never realised . In 1983 Djajakusuma served as dean of the Faculty of Arts at IKJ , and in 1984 he went to the Three Continents Festival in Nantes , France , where two of his films were shown to critical acclaim . 
 In early 1987 Djajakusuma 's doctor diagnosed him with heart disease , which led Djajakusuma to begin dieting and stop smoking . He continued to be highly respected in Indonesian film circles , but was displeased with the condition of the country 's film industry , which he considered to be on the verge of collapse . This he blamed on American cultural imperialism , which meant that most cinemas preferred screening foreign films , especially those from Hollywood , and that Indonesian youth were no longer creating a uniquely Indonesia identity . 
 Djajakusuma collapsed on 28 October 1987 while giving a speech in commemoration of the Youth Pledge at the IKJ , striking his head on a stone step . After being rushed to <unk> General Hospital , he was declared dead at 10 : 05 a.m. local time ( UTC + 7 ) . He was buried at <unk> <unk> Cemetery that evening , after ceremonies at the IKJ led by the author Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana and prayers at the Amir Hamzah Mosque in Ismail Marzuki Hall led by the poet Taufiq Ismail . Among the mourners were the former Minister of Information <unk> , the Minister of Education and Culture Fuad Hassan , and the Deputy Governor of Jakarta Anwar Umar . 
 Djajakusuma had never married , but left behind several nieces and nephews whom he had raised as his own children . After his death , newspapers throughout Jakarta carried obituaries by such cultural and film figures as Alisjahbana , the producer Misbach Yusa Biran , and the Perfini cameraman Soemardjono . These obituaries emphasised Djajakusuma 's role in the development of the Indonesian film industry and the preservation of traditional culture . In a ceremony commemorating the fifth anniversary of Djajakusuma 's death , all his documents and books were donated to the IKJ library . 
 = = Style = = 
 Like Usmar Ismail , Djajakusuma was influenced by realism . However , while Ismail preferred to focus on national @-@ level themes , Djajakusuma was more drawn to simple , locally relevant storylines with educational messages . This realism carried over into Djajakusuma 's work in wayang . The settings , traditionally drawn , were instead created as three @-@ dimensional sets , including representations of trees , rocks , and water . According to Soemardjono , who often edited Djajakusuma 's films , the director enjoyed experimenting with new techniques to better convey his intentions . 
 Djajakusuma often included traditional arts in his films , and two of them ( Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda ) were based on traditional wayang stories and used wayang @-@ inspired costumes and tempos . This focus on aspects of traditional culture fell out of the mainstream after 1965 , having been replaced by films about city life . Djajakusuma 's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques , adapting the traditional styles for the modern world . As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre , Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts . He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture , not continuously look towards the West . In other areas he was mostly apolitical . 
 The Indonesian sociologist Umar Kayam , who had served on the Jakarta Art Council with Djajakusuma , described the director as highly disciplined . Biran described him as having a fiery temper which could be triggered suddenly , yet quick to calm when the trigger was removed ; this sentiment was echoed by several people who had worked with Djajakusuma . Coverage in the film magazine <unk> described him as hardworking and highly dedicated to his craft , to the point of forsaking romantic relationships . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Djajakusuma 's film Harimau Tjampa garnered him the Best Screenplay Award at the 1954 Asian Film Festival . His later film Bimo Kroda was recognised by the Indonesian Department of Information for promoting traditional culture . In 1970 he received an Art Award from the Indonesian government for " his service to the State as the Main Promoter of the Development of Modern Drama " . At the 1987 Indonesian Film Festival , he received a special award for his contributions to the film industry , and in November 2003 he was posthumously granted a Budaya Parama Dharma Award by President Megawati Sukarnoputri for his contributions to the development of Indonesian culture . 
 Critical reception has been positive . The award @-@ winning director Teguh Karya cited the works of Djajakusuma , Usmar Ismail , and Asrul Sani as " legendary " and among his greatest influences . Choreographer <unk> <unk> reportedly so respected Djajakusuma that he had named his son <unk> after the director . According to a memorial in the newspaper Kompas , Djajakusuma was also dubbed a " living legend " during his visit to Nantes . A later Kompas article records Djajakusuma 's best @-@ remembered works are Harimau Tjampa and Tjambuk Api . Those two works are those most often shown , owing to the fact that ready @-@ to @-@ use copies are stored at Sinematek Indonesia ; his other surviving films are kept as negatives .

 In Norse mythology , Fenrir ( Old Norse : " fen @-@ dweller " ) , Fenrisúlfr ( Old Norse : " Fenris wolf " ) , <unk> ( Old Norse : " fame @-@ wolf " ) , or <unk> ( Old Norse : " the monster of the river <unk> " ) is a monstrous wolf . Fenrir is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources , and the Prose Edda and Heimskringla , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson . In both the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda , Fenrir is the father of the wolves Sköll and Hati Hróðvitnisson , is a son of Loki , and is foretold to kill the god Odin during the events of Ragnarök , but will in turn be killed by Odin 's son Víðarr . 
 In the Prose Edda , additional information is given about Fenrir , including that , due to the gods ' knowledge of prophecies foretelling great trouble from Fenrir and his rapid growth , the gods bound him , and as a result Fenrir bit off the right hand of the god Týr . Depictions of Fenrir have been identified on various objects , and scholarly theories have been proposed regarding Fenrir 's relation to other canine beings in Norse mythology . Fenrir has been the subject of artistic depictions , and he appears in literature .

 Fenrir is mentioned in three stanzas of the poem Völuspá , and in two stanzas of the poem Vafþrúðnismál . In stanza 40 of the poem Völuspá , a völva divulges to Odin that , in the east , an old woman sat in the forest <unk> , " and bred there the broods of Fenrir . There will come from them all one of that number to be a moon @-@ snatcher in troll 's skin . " Further into the poem , the völva foretells that Odin will be consumed by Fenrir at Ragnarök : 
 Then is fulfilled Hlín 's 
 second sorrow , 
 when Óðinn goes 
 to fight with the wolf , 
 and Beli 's slayer , 
 bright , against Surtr . 
 Then shall Frigg 's 
 sweet friend fall . 
 In the stanza that follows , the völva describes that Odin 's " tall child of Triumph 's Sire " ( Odin 's son Víðarr ) will then come to " strike at the beast of slaughter , " and with his hands , he will drive a sword into the heart of " <unk> 's son , " avenging the death of his father . 
 In the first of two stanzas mentioning Fenrir in Vafþrúðnismál , Odin poses a question to the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir : 
 " Much I have travelled , much have I tried out , 
 much have I tested the Powers ; 
 from where will a sun come into the smooth heaven 
 when Fenrir has assailed this one ? " 
 In the stanza that follows , Vafþrúðnir responds that Sól ( here referred to as Álfröðull ) , will bear a daughter before Fenrir attacks her , and that this daughter shall continue the paths of her deceased mother through the heavens .

 In the Prose Edda , Fenrir is mentioned in three books : Gylfaginning , Skáldskaparmál and Háttatal .

 In chapter 13 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning , Fenrir is first mentioned in a stanza quoted from Völuspá . Fenrir is first mentioned in prose in chapter 25 , where the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri ( described as King Gylfi in disguise ) about the god Týr . High says that one example of Týr 's bravery is that when the Æsir were luring Fenrir ( referred to here as Fenrisúlfr ) to place the fetter Gleipnir on the wolf , Týr placed his hand within the wolf 's mouth as a pledge . This was done at Fenrir 's own request because he did not trust that the Æsir would let him go . As a result , when the Æsir refused to release him , he bit off Týr 's hand at a location " now called the wolf @-@ joint " ( the wrist ) , causing Týr to be one @-@ handed and " not considered to be a promoter of settlements between people . " 
 = = = = Gylfaginning chapter 34 = = = = 
 In chapter 34 , High describes Loki , and says that Loki had three children with a female named Angrboða located in the land of Jötunheimr ; Fenrisúlfr , the serpent Jörmungandr , and the female being Hel . High continues that , once the gods found that these three children were being brought up in the land of Jötunheimr , and when the gods " traced prophecies that from these siblings great mischief and disaster would arise for them " the gods expected a lot of trouble from the three children , partially due to the nature of the mother of the children , yet worse so due to the nature of their father . 
 High says that Odin sent the gods to gather the children and bring them to him . Upon their arrival , Odin threw Jörmungandr into " that deep sea that lies round all lands " , and then threw Hel into Niflheim , and bestowed upon her authority over nine worlds . However , the Æsir brought up the wolf " at home " , and only Týr had the courage to approach Fenrir , and give Fenrir food . The gods noticed that Fenrir was growing rapidly every day , and since all prophecies foretold that Fenrir was destined to cause them harm , the gods formed a plan . The gods prepared three fetters : The first , greatly strong , was called Leyding . They brought Leyding to Fenrir and suggested that the wolf try his strength with it . Fenrir judged that it was not beyond his strength , and so let the gods do what they wanted with it . At Fenrir 's first kick the bind snapped , and Fenrir loosened himself from Leyding . The gods made a second fetter , twice as strong , and named it Dromi . The gods asked Fenrir to try the new fetter , and that should he break this feat of engineering , Fenrir would achieve great fame for his strength . Fenrir considered that the fetter was very strong , yet also that his strength had grown since he broke Leyding , yet that he would have to take some risks if he were to become famous . Fenrir allowed them to place the fetter . 
 When the Æsir exclaimed that they were ready , Fenrir shook himself , knocked the fetter to the ground , strained hard , and kicking with his feet , snapped the fetter – breaking it into pieces that flew far into the distance . High says that , as a result , to " loose from Leyding " or to " strike out of Dromi " have become sayings for when something is achieved with great effort . The Æsir started to fear that they would not be able to bind Fenrir , and so Odin sent Freyr 's messenger Skírnir down into the land of <unk> to " some dwarfs " and had them make a fetter called Gleipnir . The dwarves constructed Gleipnir from six mythical ingredients . After an exchange between Gangleri and High , High continues that the fetter was smooth and soft as a silken ribbon , yet strong and firm . The messenger brought the ribbon to the Æsir , and they thanked him heartily for completing the task . 
 The Æsir went out on to the lake <unk> sent for Fenrir to accompany them , and continued to the island <unk> ( Old Norse " a place overgrown with heather " ) . The gods showed Fenrir the silken fetter Gleipnir , told him to tear it , stated that it was much stronger than it appeared , passed it among themselves , used their hands to pull it , and yet it did not tear . However , they said that Fenrir would be able to tear it , to which Fenrir replied : 
 " It looks to me that with this ribbon as though I will gain no fame from it if I do tear apart such a slender band , but if it is made with art and trickery , then even if it does look thin , this band is not going on my legs . " 
 The Æsir said Fenrir would quickly tear apart a thin silken strip , noting that Fenrir earlier broke great iron binds , and added that if Fenrir wasn 't able to break slender Gleipnir then Fenrir is nothing for the gods to fear , and as a result would be freed . Fenrir responded : 
 " If you bind me so that I am unable to release myself , then you will be standing by in such a way that I should have to wait a long time before I got any help from you . I am reluctant to have this band put on me . But rather than that you question my courage , let someone put his hand in my mouth as a pledge that this is done in good faith . " 
 With this statement , all of the Æsir look to one another , finding themselves in a dilemma . Everyone refused to place their hand in Fenrir 's mouth until Týr put out his right hand and placed it into the wolf 's jaws . When Fenrir kicked , Gleipnir caught tightly , and the more Fenrir struggled , the stronger the band grew . At this , everyone laughed , except Týr , who there lost his right hand . When the gods knew that Fenrir was fully bound , they took a cord called <unk> ( Old Norse " fetter " ) hanging from Gleipnir , inserted the cord through a large stone slab called Gjöll ( Old Norse " scream " ) , and the gods fastened the stone slab deep into the ground . After , the gods took a great rock called <unk> ( Old Norse " hitter , batterer " ) , and thrust it even further into the ground as an anchoring peg . Fenrir reacted violently ; he opened his jaws very wide , and tried to bite the gods . Then the gods thrust a sword into his mouth . Its hilt touched the lower jaw and its point the upper one ; by means of it the jaws of the wolf were spread apart and the wolf gagged . Fenrir " howled horribly , " saliva ran from his mouth , and this saliva formed the river <unk> ( Old Norse " hope " ) . There Fenrir will lie until Ragnarök . Gangleri comments that Loki created a " pretty terrible family " though important , and asks why the Æsir did not just kill Fenrir there since they expected great malice from him . High replies that " so greatly did the gods respect their holy places and places of sanctuary that they did not want to defile them with the wolf 's blood even though the prophecies say that he will be the death of Odin . "

 In chapter 38 , High says that there are many men in Valhalla , and many more who will arrive , yet they will " seem too few when the wolf comes . " In chapter 51 , High foretells that as part of the events of Ragnarök , after Fenrir 's son Sköll has swallowed the sun and his other son Hati Hróðvitnisson has swallowed the moon , the stars will disappear from the sky . The earth will shake violently , trees will be uprooted , mountains will fall , and all binds will snap – Fenrisúlfr will be free . Fenrisúlfr will go forth with his mouth opened wide , his upper jaw touching the sky and his lower jaw the earth , and flames will burn from his eyes and nostrils . Later , Fenrisúlfr will arrive at the field Vígríðr with his sibling Jörmungandr . With the forces assembled there , an immense battle will take place . During this , Odin will ride to fight Fenrisúlfr . During the battle , Fenrisúlfr will eventually swallow Odin , killing him , and Odin 's son Víðarr will move forward and kick one foot into the lower jaw of the wolf . This foot will bear a legendary shoe " for which the material has been collected throughout all time . " With one hand , Víðarr will take hold of the wolf 's upper jaw and tear apart his mouth , killing Fenrisúlfr . High follows this prose description by citing various quotes from Völuspá in support , some of which mention Fenrir . 
 = = = = Skáldskaparmál and Háttatal = = = = 
 In the Epilogue section of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál , a euhemerized monologue equates Fenrisúlfr to Pyrrhus , attempting to rationalize that " it killed Odin , and Pyrrhus could be said to be a wolf according to their religion , for he paid no respect to places of sanctuary when he killed the king in the temple in front of Thor 's altar . " In chapter 2 , " wolf 's enemy " is cited as a kenning for Odin as used by the 10th century skald Egill Skallagrímsson . In chapter 9 , " feeder of the wolf " is given as a kenning for Týr and , in chapter 11 , " slayer of Fenrisúlfr " is presented as a kenning for Víðarr . In chapter 50 , a section of <unk> by the 9th century skald Bragi Boddason is quoted that refers to Hel , the being , as " the monstrous wolf 's sister . " In chapter 75 , names for wargs and wolves are listed , including both " <unk> " and " Fenrir . " " Fenrir " appears twice in verse as a common noun for a " wolf " or " <unk> " in chapter 58 of Skáldskaparmál , and in chapter 56 of the book Háttatal . Additionally , the name " Fenrir " can be found among a list of jötnar in chapter 75 of Skáldskaparmál . 
 = = = Heimskringla = = = 
 At the end of the Heimskringla saga Hákonar saga góða , the poem Hákonarmál by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir is presented . The poem is about the fall of King Haakon I of Norway ; although he is Christian , he is taken by two valkyries to Valhalla , and is there received as one of the Einherjar . Towards the end of the poem , a stanza relates sooner will the bonds of Fenrir snap than as good a king as Haakon shall stand in his place : 
 Unfettered will fare the Fenris Wolf 
 and ravaged the realm of men , 
 ere that cometh a kingly prince 
 as good , to stand in his stead .

 Thorwald 's Cross , a partially surviving runestone erected at Kirk Andreas on the Isle of Man , depicts a bearded human holding a spear downward at a wolf , his right foot in its mouth , while a large bird sits at his shoulder . Rundata dates it to 940 , while Pluskowski dates it to the 11th century . This depiction has been interpreted as Odin , with a raven or eagle at his shoulder , being consumed by Fenrir at Ragnarök . On the reverse of the stone is another image parallel to it that has been described as Christ triumphing over Satan . These combined elements have led to the cross as being described as " syncretic art " ; a mixture of pagan and Christian beliefs .

 The mid @-@ 11th century Gosforth Cross , located in Cumbria , England , has been described as depicting a combination of scenes from the Christian Judgement Day and the pagan Ragnarök . The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style , including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head , one of whose feet is thrust into the beast 's forked tongue and on its lower jaw , while a hand is placed against its upper jaw , a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir . This depiction has been theorized as a metaphor for Christ 's defeat of Satan .

 The 11th century Ledberg stone in Sweden , similarly to Thorwald 's Cross , features a figure with his foot at the mouth of a four @-@ legged beast , and this may also be a depiction of Odin being devoured by Fenrir at Ragnarök .

The Younger Futhark inscription on the stone bears a commonly seen memorial dedication , but is followed by an encoded runic sequence that has been described as " mysterious , " and " an interesting magic formula which is known from all over the ancient Norse world .

 If the images on the <unk> Runestone are correctly identified as depicting Ragnarök , then Fenrir is shown above the ship Naglfar . 
 Meyer Schapiro theorizes a connection between the " Hell Mouth " that appears in medieval Christian iconography and Fenrir . According to Schapiro , " the Anglo @-@ Saxon taste for the Hell Mouth was perhaps influenced by the northern pagan myth of the Crack of Doom and the battle with the wolf , who devoured Odin . " 
 = = Theories = = 
 In reference to Fenrir 's presentation in the Prose Edda , Andy Orchard theorizes that " the hound ( or wolf ) " Garmr , Sköll , and Hati Hróðvitnisson were originally simply all Fenrir , stating that " Snorri , characteristically , is careful to make distinctions , naming the wolves who devour the sun and moon as Sköll and Hati Hróðvitnisson respectively , and describing an encounter between Garm and Týr ( who , one would have thought , might like to get his hand on Fenrir ) at Ragnarök . " 
 John Lindow says that it is unclear why the gods decide to raise Fenrir as opposed to his siblings Hel and Jörmungandr in Gylfaginning chapter 35 , theorizing that it may be " because Odin had a connection with wolves ? Because Loki was Odin 's blood brother ? " Referring to the same chapter , Lindow comments that neither of the phrases that Fenrir 's binding result in have left any other traces . Lindow compares Fenrir 's role to his father Loki and Fenrir 's sibling Jörmungandr , in that they all spend time with the gods , are bound or cast out by them , return " at the end of the current mythic order to destroy them , only to be destroyed himself as a younger generation of gods , one of them his slayer , survives into the new world order . " 
 Indo @-@ European parallels have been proposed between myths of Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman . The <unk> refer to a story where <unk> <unk> rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years . An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary . The ruler Taxmoruw ( <unk> <unk> ) managed to lasso Ahriman ( Angra Mainyu ) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day . After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw . In a sexual encounter with Ahriman , Jamshid , Taxmoruw 's brother , inserted his hand into Ahriman 's anus and pulled out his brother 's corpse . His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards . The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being ( Odin and Fenrir ) , trickery involving the thrusting of a hand into a monster 's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb ( Týr and Fenrir ) . 
 Ethologist Valerius Geist wrote that Fenrir 's maiming and ultimate killing of Odin , who had previously nurtured him , was likely based on true experiences of wolf @-@ behaviour , seeing as wolves are genetically encoded to rise up the pack hierarchy and have on occasion been recorded to rebel against and kill their parents . Geist states that " apparently , even the ancients knew that wolves may turn on their parents and siblings and kill them . "

 Fenrir has been depicted in the artwork " Odin and Fenris " ( 1909 ) and " The Binding of Fenris " ( around 1900 ) by Dorothy Hardy , " Odin und <unk> " and " <unk> des <unk> " ( 1901 ) by Emil Doepler , and is the subject of the metal sculpture " Fenrir " by A. V. <unk> located on the island of Askøy , Norway . 
 Fenrir appears in modern literature in the poem " Om <unk> og Tyr " ( 1819 ) by Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger ( collected in Nordens Guder ) , the novel Der <unk> by K. H. <unk> , and Til <unk> mod <unk> ( 1974 ) by E. K. Reich and E. Larsen . 
 Fenrir also appears in the MOBA game <unk> as a playable character . 
 = Double @-@ tuned amplifier = 
 A double @-@ tuned amplifier is a tuned amplifier with transformer coupling between the amplifier stages in which the inductances of both the primary and secondary windings are tuned separately with a capacitor across each . The scheme results in a wider bandwidth and steeper skirts than a single tuned circuit would achieve . 
 There is a critical value of transformer coupling coefficient at which the frequency response of the amplifier is maximally flat in the passband and the gain is maximum at the resonant frequency . Designs frequently use a coupling greater than this ( over @-@ coupling ) in order to achieve an even wider bandwidth at the expense of a small loss of gain in the centre of the passband . 
 Cascading multiple stages of double @-@ tuned amplifiers results in a reduction of the bandwidth of the overall amplifier . Two stages of double @-@ tuned amplifier have 80 % of the bandwidth of a single stage . An alternative to double tuning that avoids this loss of bandwidth is staggered tuning . Stagger @-@ tuned amplifiers can be designed to a prescribed bandwidth that is greater than the bandwidth of any single stage . However , staggered tuning requires more stages and has lower gain than double tuning . 
 = = Typical circuit = = 
 The circuit shown consists of two stages of amplifier in common emitter topology . The bias resistors all serve their usual functions . The input of the first stage is coupled in the conventional way with a series capacitor to avoid affecting the bias . However , the collector load consists of a transformer which serves as the inter @-@ stage coupling instead of capacitors . The windings of the transformer have inductance . <unk> placed across the transformer windings form resonant circuits which provide the tuning of the amplifier . 
 A further detail that may be seen in this kind of amplifier is the presence of taps on the transformer windings . These are used for the input and output connections of the transformer rather than the top of the windings . This is done for impedance matching purposes ; bipolar junction transistor amplifiers ( the kind shown in the circuit ) have a quite high output impedance and a quite low input impedance . This problem can be avoided by using MOSFETs which have a very high input impedance . 
 The capacitors connected between the bottom of the transformer secondary windings and ground do not form part of the tuning . Rather , their purpose is to decouple the transistor bias resistors from the AC circuit . 
 = = Properties = = 
 Double tuning , as compared to single tuning , has the effect of widening the bandwidth of the amplifier and steepening the skirt of the response . Tuning both sides of the transformer forms a pair of coupled resonators which is the source of the increased bandwidth . The gain of the amplifier is a function of the coupling coefficient , k , which is related to the mutual inductance , M , and the primary and secondary winding inductances , Lp and Ls respectively , by 
 <formula> 
 There is a critical value of coupling at which the gain of the amplifier is a maximum at resonance . Below this critical value , there is a single peak in the frequency response with the amplitude peaking at resonance and the peak decreasing as k decreases . Such a response is said to be <unk> , At values of k above critical coupling the response starts to split into two peaks . These peaks become narrower and further apart as k increases and the gap between them ( centred on the resonant frequency ) becomes progressively deeper . Such a response is said to be <unk> . 
 A critically coupled amplifier has a response that is maximally flat . This response can also be achieved without transformers with two stages of a stagger @-@ tuned amplifier . Unlike staggered tuning , double tuning usually tunes both resonators to the same resonant frequency . However , a designer might choose to design an <unk> amplifier in order to achieve a wider bandwidth at the expense of a small dip ( typically 3 dB ) in the centre of the frequency response . 
 Like synchronous tuning , adding more stages of double @-@ tuned amplifiers has the effect of reducing the bandwidth . The 3 dB bandwidth of n identical stages , as a fraction of the bandwidth of a single stage , is given approximately by , 
 <formula> 
 This expression applies only to small fractional bandwidths .

 The circuit can be represented in a more generic way by replacing the amplifiers with a generalised transconductance amplifier as shown .

 = Fort Yellowstone = 
 Fort Yellowstone was a U.S. Army fort , established in 1891 at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park . Yellowstone was designated in 1872 but the Interior Department was unable to effectively manage the park . Administration was transferred to the War Department in August 1886 and General Philip Sheridan sent a company of cavalry to Mammoth Hot Springs to build a cavalry post . The army originally called the post Camp Sheridan in honor of General Sheridan but the name was changed to Fort Yellowstone in 1891 when construction of the permanent fort commenced . The army administered the park until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created National Park Service . The facilities of Fort Yellowstone now comprise the Yellowstone National Park headquarters , the Horace Albright Visitor Center and staff accommodations . 
 Between the years 1891 and 1913 , a total of 60 structures were erected at Fort Yellowstone , of which 35 were still in existence one hundred years later . The fort was built in two major construction waves . During the first construction period from 1891 to 1897 , mainly wood @-@ framed buildings in what has been referred to as " cottage style " were built . A few of them had Colonial Revival architectural elements . A second construction wave began in 1908 and concluded in 1913 . These structures were primarily built from locally quarried sandstone . Many of the structures from the later construction period are now used as administrative offices , residences for National Park Service employees , museums and visitor center . Beyond the immediate confines of the fort , cabins were constructed for use by small detachments of army personnel while on patrol throughout the park . 
 Besides the buildings of Fort Yellowstone , the army left a legacy of policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks . The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols , wildlife protection and management , and protection of natural features . Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service as part of their resource management . The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks . The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers . 
 = = History = = 
 More than 40 years before the creation of the National Park Service , Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1 , 1872 , as the world 's first national park . Between 1872 and 1886 , the park was administered by the Interior Department and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources or legal authority to maintain and protect the park 's natural features and wildlife , or to deal with poaching , vandalism and other destructive activities . Over the next decade , special interest groups such as concessionaires , railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands . The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent degradation of the park and in some circumstances , was complicit with special interest groups . Senator George Vest led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the resource , and along with other members of Congress believed that only the military could effectively protect the park . A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the War Department , thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park . 
 In August 1886 , Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan sent Company M , 1st U.S. Cavalry to the Park , where they established Camp Sheridan , named after General Sheridan , at Mammoth Hot Springs . Camp Sheridan consisted of an arrangement of temporary facilities at the base of Capitol Hill just east of the Mammoth Hot Springs travertine terraces . None of the facilities that comprised Camp Sheridan remain as they were all removed over the years . 
 Congress appropriated funds for the establishment of a permanent fort in 1891 , and the Interior Department allocated land just north of Camp Sheridan for permanent facilities . Camp Sheridan was renamed Fort Yellowstone on May 11 , 1891 . The army continued to use Fort Yellowstone until they turned over control of the park and the fort to the newly formed National Park Service in October 1918 . 
 Fort Yellowstone was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 31 , 2003 . The fort , along with concessionaire facilities that were built after the National Park Service assumed management of the park , comprise what is collectively known as the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 Fort Yellowstone was constructed between 1891 and 1913 on the eastern edge of the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces , southeast of the present Mammoth Hotel , at a cost of approximately $ 700 @,@ 000 ( $ 16 million in 2013 dollars ) . By 1905 , three more troops of cavalry had been added to the original Company M contingent of 50 soldiers , and during this period the fort facilities were almost continuously expanded to meet the requirements of park administration , ordinary cavalry training , and growing numbers of visitors . 
 The initial wave of construction between 1891 – 97 was representative of typical army posts of the period . Like other western military posts , the earliest buildings erected at Fort Yellowstone were constructed according to quartermaster general standardized plans . In design , they were of a generally spartan appearance with a few Colonial Revival style domestic elements , described by the army as " cottage style " . 
 The buildings were of one to two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stories in height , and of frame construction with drop siding and stone foundations , with evenly spaced double @-@ hung sash windows and prominent porches . 
 A second phase of building and upgrades started in 1908 which resulted in the prominent architecture visible at Fort Yellowstone in the 21st century . Built from locally quarried sandstone , these buildings defined Fort Yellowstone . The most prominent of the structures built in the later period is the Horace Albright Visitor Center which was originally the bachelor officers ' quarters ( Bldg 1 ) . Each historic building in the fort and the park was assigned an official number , with the original bachelor officers ' quarters being building number 1 . Architects Reed and Stem and Robert Reamer along with the U.S. Army Office of the Chief Quartermaster , Department of Dakota participated in the design of many of the facilities . Engineer facilities and landscaping were designed by Captain Hiram M. Chittenden of the U.S. Corps of Engineers . 
 = = = Initial construction period 1891 – 1907 = = = 
 The first building constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the guardhouse ( Bldg 9 ) at the southwest corner of the fort . In 1891 , visitors traveled the lower Mammoth road through what is now the main residential area for park personnel . The guardhouse was the first building they encountered in the Mammoth area and there was always a sentry on duty to check visitors entering the park . The building is now a private residence . The original fort administration building ( Bldg 8 ) was located immediately next to the guardhouse and is now also a private residence . Of the twelve buildings constructed in 1891 , the most prominent are two of the four double officers ' quarters ( Bldgs 6 and 7 ) which front the old parade ground . Other buildings constructed in 1891 included a 60 @-@ man barracks , a commissary storehouse ( Bldg 10 ) , a quartermaster storehouse ( Bldg 11 ) , a granary ( Bldg 12 ) , a bakery ( Bldg 24 ) , a stable ( Bldg 25 ) and the first two of four non @-@ commissioned officers ' ( NCO ) quarters ( Bldgs 30 and 33 ) . These NCO quarters became known as " soap @-@ suds row ' because many of the NCO wives were former army <unk> who supplemented their husbands ' income by doing laundry for post personnel . 
 A number of significant buildings were added to the fort from 1893 to 1899 including a 10 @-@ bed hospital , quarters for hospital personnel ( Bldg 14 ) , and a large hay shed ( Bldg 20 ) which were constructed in areas behind officers ' row in 1894 . Of these structures , only the hospital quarters building remains and is now used as a private residence . The most significant building constructed in 1895 was the U.S. Commissioner 's office , which included a jail and residence for the U.S. Marshal ( Bldg 49 ) . The first commissioner was Judge John W. Meldrum who served the army and National Park Service until 1935 from this building . Located well west of the rest of the fort , this was the first stone building within the fort . It was a one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ story rock @-@ faced sandstone dwelling with gable @-@ on @-@ hip roof , through @-@ the @-@ cornice dormers and a full @-@ width porch . The ground floor of the house contained the jail , office , and living quarters while bedrooms were situated on the second floor . The structure is used today as a private residence . The building was funded with the passage of the Lacey Act of 1894 . Sponsored by U.S. Representative John F. Lacey , the Lacey Act was " An Act To protect the birds and animals in Yellowstone National Park , and to punish crimes in said park , and for other purposes . " 
 Construction during this period also included two double officers ' quarters ( Bldgs 4 and 5 ) which completed " officers ' row " in 1893 . Two NCO quarters ( Bldgs 31 and 32 ) were added to " soap @-@ suds row " in 1897 and the distinctive cavalry barracks ( Bldg 27 ) , which now houses administrative offices , was constructed in 1899 . 
 Captain Hiram M. Chittenden was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers senior engineer in Yellowstone from 1899 – 1906 . The Corps had been responsible for road and other infrastructure construction within the park since 1883 . In 1901 , in cooperation with Captain John Pitcher , Acting Park Superintendent , he began a series of projects to improve the quality of life at the fort . Chittenden had a reservoir built in 1901 to provide a consistent supply of water for irrigation , human consumption and fire fighting . The engineers oversaw a project during 1901 which cleared , <unk> and seeded the area immediately in front of officers ' row to create a grassy parade ground and seeded areas around the various buildings to reduce perennially dusty summer conditions . Fort Yellowstone transitioned from oil to electric lighting in 1902 after Chittenden completed a 100 @-@ kilowatt powerplant 300 yards ( 270 m ) east of the fort . The powerplant and reservoir no longer exist , but most of the grassy areas around Fort Yellowstone that Chittenden planned remain . 
 In 1903 , Captain Chittenden oversaw the design and construction of the second stone building in Yellowstone , the engineers headquarters ( Bldg 39 ) , often called the " Pagoda " because of its design . This structure is in a prominent but isolated location just north of the fort . In 1918 , after the National Park Service began administration of the park , the engineer 's headquarters building became the first official park headquarters . 
 Another prominent Yellowstone landmark , the Roosevelt Arch , was constructed in 1903 under the supervision of Chittenden . A north entrance station and gate near Gardiner , Montana , was first suggested by Captains Wilber Wilder and Oscar Brown in 1899 . However it was not until 1903 that Chittenden and then @-@ Acting Superintendent Major John Pitcher were able to gain approval for the arch . The ground breaking for the arch coincided with the two @-@ week vacation visit of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to the park . Roosevelt was the only U.S. President to visit Yellowstone during the army era . On his last day in the park , April 24 , 1903 , Roosevelt participated in the cornerstone laying ceremony and the arch was completed later that year . In 1904 , Major John Pitcher recommended the construction of several new buildings to accommodate the growing contingent of soldiers . The only structure approved was the new post exchange located just south of the double cavalry barracks . This striking Colonial Revival styled structure was completed in 1905 , replacing a much smaller post exchange that had been built in 1894 . It now functions as the National Park Service canteen . 
 = = = Later construction period 1908 – 1913 = = = 
 The second wave of major construction started in 1908 when the largest structures in the fort were built , including the three @-@ story double barracks ( Bldg 36 ) , which now houses the park superintendent 's office and is used as the modern park headquarters . Another large building was the bachelor officers ' quarters ( Bldg 1 ) , constructed immediately to the west , fronting the parade ground . This iconic building anchors the northwest corner of the main fort area and houses the Horace Albright Visitor Center , a museum , theater and the Yellowstone Association gift shop . Officers ' row was completed with the construction of a double captains ' quarters ( Bldg 2 ) and a field officers ' quarters ( Bldg 3 ) immediately south of the bachelor officers ' quarters . Cavalry stables ( Bldgs 34 and 38 ) , a double stable guardhouse and blacksmith shop ( Bldg 37 ) were built behind these residences . All these buildings are used by the National Park Service as administrative offices , maintenance facilities or residences . 
 The increasing size of the army contingent required a more up @-@ to @-@ date guardhouse than the original . Acting Superintendents Major Benson and Colonel Brett wanted the new guardhouse to be constructed of stone . The War Department could not justify the expense , so in 1911 the guardhouse was built from concrete . 
 The last building constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the chapel , located just south of the original guardhouse . Army policy did not mandate that army forts provide places of worship . However , at the insistence of park superintendent Pitcher , U.S. Commissioner Meldrum and Wyoming state senator Francis E. Warren , Congress appropriated the funds for the construction of a chapel in 1909 and the building was finished in January 1913 . On September 19 , 1914 , Katharine Piercy Edmunds and Captain Albert Ady King , 1st U.S. Cavalry , were the first couple to be married in the new chapel . Reverend Pritchard , an Episcopalian missionary , traveled to the fort from Emigrant , Montana to perform the ceremony . 
 = = = Remote facilities = = = 
 To provide shelter for small detachments of soldiers on overnight patrols , the army constructed soldier and snowshoe cabins in remote and isolated spots and at popular tourist locations . Most of these structures no longer exist , but similar , more modern cabins are maintained by the National Park Service throughout the park . 
 The first soldier cabins were built in 1886 as part of Camp Sheridan and all of these were later removed . Cabins were also built at the Lower Geyser Basin , Upper Geyser Basin , Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone , Riverside and at Soda Butte . As more outposts were needed over the years cabins were constructed at Lake Outlet ( 1887 ) , Snake River ( Polecat Creek ) , West Thumb and Riverside ( 1892 ) , Mud Geyser ( 1895 ) , Norris and Thumb Bay ( 1897 ) , Lake ( 1899 ) , Snake River ( 1902 ) , Gardiner ( 1903 ) , West Thumb , <unk> Pass and Soda Butte ( 1904 ) , Tower ( 1907 ) , <unk> Mountain ( 1912 ) , Snake River ( 1914 ) , and Aster Creek , Cabin Creek , Harebell , and Thorofare ( 1915 ) . Snowshoe cabins in existence in 1899 included small structures at <unk> Creek , Bartlet , Boundary Creek , Coulter Creek , Hellroaring Creek , Lewis River , Park Point , Proposition , Trappers Creek , Trout Creek and Willow Creek . While none of the aforementioned structures are still in existence , four remote structures remain . They include the Buffalo Lake snowshoe cabin ( Bldg 234 ) and the Norris and Bechler River soldier stations ( Bldgs 111 and 231 ) . The Norris soldier station currently houses the Museum of the National Park Ranger . Additionally , the Bechler River barn ( Bldg 232 ) is still in existence .

 U.S. Army management of Yellowstone was so successful that by 1891 they were also managing Sequoia , Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks in California and Mackinac National Park in Michigan . The National Park Service later followed the precedents established by the army and incorporated them into their own management strategy . During its tenure at Yellowstone , the army developed regulations that put emphasis on protection of park resources , safety of visitors , and positive but effective visitor interaction . Under the watchful eyes of the army , the geothermal features , forests and wildlife of Yellowstone were protected from vandalism , fire and poaching . These practices were adopted by the National Park Service and continue as a foundation of National Park management policy . Proactive actions by the army in stopping poaching in the park led to the passing of the Lacey Act of 1894 , which established legal protection for the wildlife and remedies for dealing with violators . 
 When Company M , 1st U.S. Cavalry arrived in Yellowstone , Captain Moses Harris , a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient , on his own authority and initiative , promulgated a set of rules that his staff enforced to protect park resources still adhered to in the 21st century : 
 1 ) The cutting of green timber , or the removal or displacement of any mineral deposits or natural curiosities , is forbidden . 2 ) Hunting or trapping and the discharge of firearms within the limited of the Park is prohibited . Fishing is forbidden except with hook and line , and the sale of fish so taken is also disallowed . 3 ) Wagon tires on all wagons used for freighting purposes on roads ... are required to be a least four inches in width . 4 ) Camping parties will only build fires when actually necessary . 5 ) The sale of intoxicating liquors , except by hotel proprietors to their guests , for their own use , is strictly prohibited . 6 ) Trespassers within the Park for illicit purposes , or persons wantonly violating the foregoing rules , will be summarily removed from the Park . 8 ) No rocks , sticks , or other obstructions must be thrown into any of the springs or geysers within the park . ... It is enjoined upon all soldiers ... to be vigilant and attentive in the enforcement of the foregoing regulations . ... they will in the enforcement of their orders conduct themselves in a courteous and polite , but firm and decided manner . 
 Even though Harris and his soldiers vigilantly enforced the rules , arresting many violators , there was no legal authority for prosecution or punishment . All Harris could do was expel violators from the park . 
 Captain Harris , and his successor , Captain Frazier Augustus Boutelle , established a network of soldier and snowshoe cabins throughout the remote portions of the park . These cabins , strategically located about 10 miles ( 16 km ) apart , were used by detachments of soldiers throughout the year as they stayed watchful for wildfires , vandalism and poaching . The use of remote ranger cabins for patrolling the park is still practiced by Park Rangers . Captain Young , during his first tour as Acting Superintendent in 1897 , established patrol cabin policies that are essentially still followed by Park Rangers . Young required that soldiers using a patrol cabin keep a daily log of activities , including game counts , visitor counts and weather observations . These logs were used to compile a monthly report sent to the headquarters at Fort Yellowstone . Young issued the following orders to all soldiers using the snowshoe cabins . 
 All persons are enjoined to use the rations in the snowshoe cabins only in case of necessity ; never under any circumstances to waste any of them and always to leave the cabins and their contents secure and in good condition . The ax and shovel must be left inside , the comforts hanged [ sic ] up , the cooking utensils left clean and dry and the food in its box secure from mice , etc . Enough dry wood for one night should always be left in the cabin . 
 = = = Wildlife policies = = = 
 Of the many decisions made by Captain Boutelle in managing the park , his approach to fisheries had significant and lasting impact . Boutelle was an avid angler and recognized the angling potential in Yellowstone waters . In 1889 he suggested the U.S. Fish Commission consider stocking many of the fish @-@ less lakes and streams in Yellowstone . 
 Besides the beautiful Shoshone and other smaller lakes , there 
 are hundreds of miles of as fine streams as any in existence without a fish of any kind . I have written Col. Marshall McDonald , U.S. Fish Commission , upon 
 the subject , and have received letters from him manifesting a great interest . I hope through him to see all of these waters so stocked that the pleasure @-@ seeker in the Park can enjoy fine fishing within a few rods of any hotel or camp . 
 This suggestion was acted upon and in 1889 the first non @-@ native fish were stocked into Yellowstone waters , a practice that continued until 1955 and helped create the angling experience Yellowstone National Park is renowned for . 
 In 1902 , the population of bison in the park had declined to approximately 25 individual animals . Under the leadership of Captain Pitcher , the army began a program of importing plains bison from private domestic herds in Texas and Montana . <unk> enclosures were created at Mammoth and in the Lamar Valley . Areas were ploughed and planted with oats and timothy to feed the captive bison herds as well as the expanding elk herds . The bison enclosure in the Lamar Valley became known as the Lamar Buffalo Ranch . When the army left the park in 1918 , the bison population was estimated to have increased to 400 individuals . 
 = = = Transition to the National Park Service = = = 
 After serving more than six years as the Acting Superintendent , Major John Pitcher was replaced by Lieutenant General Samuel B.M. Young ( U.S. Army retired ) in June 1907 . Young was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior , James Rudolph Garfield as full superintendent of the park . Although Young was a senior officer , command of the troops at Fort Yellowstone was given to Major H. T. Allen . Young 's lasting contribution to Fort Yellowstone 's history was his proposal to replace the army with a force of Civilian Guards . Young , who had served as Acting Superintendent as a Captain in 1897 recognized the dysfunctional and complicated relationships between the War Department , Corps of Engineers and Interior Department which Congress knew was adversely impacting the successful administration of the park . Young 's proposal was not acted upon , but it did set the stage for a decade of change that ultimately saw the creation of the National Park Service in 1916 as well as a Park Ranger force to protect the national parks . 
 Although the cavalry had been successful in protecting the park , by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous , diplomatic and tedious nature of the work , and the high level of training related to cavalry skills . World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management , to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers . In July 1914 , the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army , many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously . 
 Throughout 1915 – 16 , the Interior Department was organizing itself to deal with the growing number of national parks and ultimately , Congress created the National Park Service on August 25 , 1916 . Prior to the establishment of the National Park Service , in July 1916 the War Department agreed to withdraw troops from Yellowstone as of October 1 , 1916 , which was the end of the park visitation season . At the same time , the War Department agreed to discharge a select number of the current volunteer cavalry contingent on September 29 , 1916 , so they could go to work for the National Park Service as Park Rangers . 
 Unfortunately , Congress failed to appropriate funds for the new National Park Service for 1917 and the ranger force was disbanded in the spring of 1917 . Political pressure from the Montana Congressional delegation over the loss of economic revenue from the army presence resulted in the recall of the army and 450 soldiers from the 7th Cavalry Regiment were sent back to Fort Yellowstone to protect the park . Administrative control remained with the Interior Department under the supervision of Acting Superintendent Chester Allinson Lindsley , a long time civilian employee in the park . Relations between the army , the Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department continued to be contentious in 1917 – 1918 as disagreements over proposed construction , ownership of buildings and use of personnel persisted . In 1918 , Director of the National Park Service Stephen Mather convinced Congress and the War Department that civilian control of the National Parks under the National Park Service was the right solution . On October 31 , 1918 , the army left Yellowstone for the last time . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 John Muir a foremost American naturalist and often called the " Father of the National Parks " once wrote : " Blessings on Uncle Sam 's Soldiers . They have done the job well , and every pine tree is waving its arms for joy . " 
 While Yellowstone was under army management , the activities , policies and procedures developed served as precedents for other national parks and subsequent actions by the National Park Service after its formation in 1916 . The army solved a wide variety of problems and developed procedures covering a multitude of administrative issues . The military superintendents continued the evolution of park policies and conservation measures initiated by the first civilian administrators . They implemented backcountry patrols , access improvement , wildlife protection and management , protection of natural features , law enforcement and development of a ranger force . The army set precedents for future headquarters area development designs , visitor services such as educational outreach and interpretive tours . Their diligence in dealing with poachers led to legislation that provided for prosecution and punishment of illegal activity . That most of the precedents that the army established were incorporated later by the National Park Service is a lasting legacy of the important role the army played in U.S. national park history . Modern Park Ranger uniforms are legacies of army management of the park . Most iconically , the campaign hat , a flat @-@ brow peaked hat worn by the cavalry in the last years of army management is nearly identical to the modern hats worn into the 21st century .

 Devil May Cry 4 is an action @-@ adventure hack and slash video game developed and published by Capcom in 2008 for the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and Windows platforms . The game is the fourth installment to the Devil May Cry series . It later on generated a handheld version released on iOS , titled Devil May Cry 4 : Refrain . Chronologically , the game is set between the original Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 2 . 
 The story follows Nero , a teenager possessing demonic powers who is on a mission to stop the series ' main character , Dante , after he assassinates demons from the Order of the Sword including its leader . During the game , the player controls both Nero and Dante as they fight enemies in close combat using firearms , swords , and other weapons . Devil May Cry 4 was the first entry in the series to release for multiple consoles at the same time ; during its development , Capcom focused on all versions achieving the same visual quality . 
 Critical reception to Devil May Cry 4 was positive , with praise aimed towards its challenging difficulty and the characters ' special moves . However , it was also criticized for its backtracking and a troublesome camera . The game sold over 3 million units worldwide , becoming the series ' best @-@ selling title . It has also been adapted into a two @-@ volume light novel by its original writer , Bingo Morihashi . 
 A remastered version of the game was released in June 2015 as Devil May Cry 4 : Special Edition , which adds both English and Japanese voice tracks , improved visual effects and textures , in @-@ game re @-@ balancing , additional costumes , and 3 bonus playable characters : Vergil , returning from Devil May Cry 3 , Trish , playable for the first time since Devil May Cry 2 , and Lady , who makes her playable debut . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Gameplay in Devil May Cry 4 is similar to previous games in the series . The player must fight through levels called " missions " , occasionally solving puzzles or gathering items . Performance in a mission is graded from D being the bottom grade through C , B , A , S , SS , and SSS being the highest grade . Grades are based on items used , Red Orbs gathered , time taken , and the amount of Style Points accumulated . Each Style Point grade has its own tag @-@ word . The stylish grade shows up on the side of the screen and starts at " Deadly " ( D ) ; progresses through " Carnage " ( C ) , " Brutal " ( B ) , and " Atomic " ( A ) ; then , progresses through one last bar of grade containing the phrases " Smokin ' " ( S ) , " Smokin ' Style " ( SS ) , and lastly " Smokin ' Sick Style " ( SSS ) . Stylish combat is the main focus of the game , which is conveyed through unbroken combos of varied attacks while avoiding damage . The player must avoid enemy attacks to continue performing combos , often by memorizing attack patterns . The Devil Trigger is a super state that enables the player to become more powerful adding a slow but steady health regeneration , with increased damage done . Devil Trigger can be activated by pressing the button to trigger it when the minimum amount on the gauge is filled . 
 Some changes introduced into Devil May Cry 4 are the presence of two playable characters , Dante and Nero , and a slight modification to the shop system . A new currency , Proud Souls , is used to buy new abilities while Red Orbs are used to buy items . Proud Souls are rewarded at the end of missions and the amount varies depending on how well the player performed . Cost of abilities also increase with the purchase of other abilities , though all abilities can be sold back for the original price . 
 The player plays as Nero throughout most of the game . He is equipped with the Red Queen sword , Blue Rose revolver , and the powers of his Devil Bringer . The Red Queen features an <unk> Gauge that can be charged up , allowing for subsequent attacks that are more powerful than regular slashes , until the gauge empties . Nero also has the powers of his Devil Bringer , and can use it to pull himself towards enemies or vice versa . The Devil Bringer may also be used for context @-@ sensitive throw attacks , leading to high damage and various effects depending on the enemy . Nero 's Devil Bringer also gains new abilities during the course of the game , such as being able to detect secret missions or caches of Red Orbs . Nero eventually gains the ability to use Devil Trigger after getting the katana known as Yamato , which increases his Devil Bringer 's power , thus changing his Devil Bringer attacks into more powerful versions with different animations . 
 The player plays as Dante through seven missions , taking over halfway through the game . His gameplay is similar to that of Devil May Cry 3 , with him having access to multiple melee and ranged weapons which he gains after boss battles , and being able to cycle through them freely in combat , being no longer limited to equipping two weapons of each type as he was in the previous game . Dante also starts with his four styles , each of which grants him different abilities , but he may now switch them at will with buttons or pads on the controller , unlike in Devil May Cry 3 . He also gains the Dark Slayer style near the end of his appearance , which only has one style level . Styles do not level up through experience as in the previous game , but must instead be upgraded like other skills in the shop screen in between missions or at statues . Dante can also enter Devil Trigger ; in his Devil Trigger he gains most of the benefits that Nero 's Devil Trigger has , though , as he does not have the Devil Bringer , he gets animation and property changes on some of his normal attacks instead . 
 The Special Edition introduces a new gameplay for each new characters like Vergil , Lady and Trish . Lady and Trish , like Dante and Nero , also only playable on a certain mission routes . 
 The player plays Lady will have a same mission route as Nero . She has a similar gameplay as Nero , such as the grappling move mechanism . However , Her combat style relies heavily on using her firearms . 
 The player plays Trish will have a same mission route as Dante . She has a similar gameplay as Dante . According to Hideaki <unk> , the director of Devil May Cry 3 & 4 , states that " ... she does away her weapon switching and instead use of the Sparda Sword in the variety of ways that require the use of relatively few buttons . " He also stated that her style is " ... distinctly different you 've seen anything in the game until now . 
 The player plays Vergil through all game 's missions . He retain his moves from the Special Edition of Devil May Cry 3 , including the close ranged weapon switches , but also added with elements from the reboot of the franchise DmC : Devil May Cry . It is known that his moves are also fully upgradable . And a feature was added for his choice of stylized fighting , which is known as the " Concentration " mechanic . While in action , Vergil 's abilities and moves will grow stronger and faster the more calmly and flawlessly he fights . The Concentration mechanic is signaled by a blue gauge in the upper left corner of the screen which is Vergil 's Concentration Gauge . It has three levels . The higher the level , the more powerful attacks he will be able to perform . To increase the gauge , Vergil can land attacks on enemies and dodge their attacks , but if he is hit by an enemy or if he runs , these cause the gauge to deplete . Missing attacks also depletes the gauge , so the player must be efficient with their attacks during battle . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In an extra Special Edition story of Vergil , set before the events of Devil May Cry 3 : Dante 's Awakening , Vergil had been traveling the world , looking for information about his father , Sparda . It was during this time that he visited the city of Fortuna to investigate the Order of the Sword . Upon his arrival into the city , Vergil wondered why they worship a demon like Sparda as a god . As he pondered , a horde of <unk> surround him , but Vergil dispatches them with little effort . After that brief encounter , Vergil then continued deeper into Fortuna , intending to learn more about the Order and their intentions . As he walked , he passed by a group of pedestrians , with a woman in a scarlet red dress taking notice of him as he walked away . After finishing his investigation of the Order 's plan , Vergil soon leaves the town pondering whether or not one can call them misguided for their worship . As he walks away , he vows that one day the Order will know the true power of the son of Sparda . 
 Nero is a young man who works as a demon hunter for the Order of the Sword that worships the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda as a god . When he goes to the Opera House to see his love interest Kyrie perform for The Order of the Sword 's ceremony , the Order 's high priest Sanctus is murdered by Dante , the son of Sparda who appears suddenly after crashing through a skylight . The Order 's Holy Knights , led by Kyrie 's older brother Credo , try to subdue Dante but he defeats them easily . Promising to return with help , Credo takes Kyrie to safety and leaves Nero to stall Dante . Tapping into his dormant demonic power , Nero overwhelms Dante . Impressed , Dante ( before leaving ) reveals that the Holy Knights members he killed were actually demons . Credo gives Nero the task of stopping Dante in Fortuna Castle . 
 In the castle , Nero discovers that Order of the Sword 's Agnus has secretly been experimenting with demonic power using the demonic energy from Yamato , the long lost sword that used to belong to Dante 's brother , Vergil . Agnus has created an army of demon infused warriors and several Hell Gates across Fortuna under the orders of Sanctus himself who has revived as a demon . Nero fights Agnus fully unlocking his own dormant demonic power thanks to Yamato . When Agnus flees to Headquarters , Nero follows him and tries to piece together The Order 's plan involving the Hell Gates . He discovers that Credo is part of the conspiracy , having similarly become a demon . Credo is tasked by Sanctus to stop Nero , while Gloria has taken up Nero 's job of hunting Dante . However , Credo stops his mission when Agnus uses Kyrie as a bait to capture Nero . 
 Nero decides to save Kyrie from Sanctus , but encounters Dante , who tests him in fight to see if he is worthy of Yamato . Dante wins this time but lets Nero retain Yamato . Nero finds Sanctus in the Headquarters with an enormous statue , which Sanctus calls " The Savior . " Sanctus reveals that only Yamato and the Legendary Sparda Sword , along with Sparda 's blood can awaken the Savior . Having already received the Sparda Sword from Gloria , Sanctus proceeds to absorb Nero , who has Sparda 's blood . Using Kyrie as a human shield to distract Nero , he succeeds in capturing him . Credo attempts to rescue Nero and Kyrie but is mortally wounded by Sanctus . Dante and his partner Trish , revealed to be Gloria , appear , unable to stop the proceedings , and promise Credo in his final moments to save Kyrie and Nero . 
 Underneath the city , Agnus opens the true Hell Gate with Yamato , which releases countless demons . Using The Savior to defeat the oncoming demons , Sanctus plans to strengthen the people 's worship by acting as their saviour . Dante succeeds in destroying all of the false gates Agnus created , and kills him . After reclaiming Yamato , Dante engages Sanctus . Dante takes Yamato and drives it through the Savior 's chest , freeing Nero , who reclaims it inside The Savior . He races to the Savior 's Heart where Sanctus awaits , with Kyrie as his prisoner . Facing Sanctus , Nero stabs him and saves Kyrie and both escape the confines of The Savior . The Savior reawakens , having absorbed Sanctus 's soul . Destroying this final demon , Nero finally makes peace with his demonic heritage after acknowledging the power it has given him to save those he cares about . Dante entrusts him with Yamato before departing . Nero and Kyrie then reconcile in the ruins of Fortuna . In an extra Special Edition scene in a same time as Nero and Dante 's story ending from original edition in Lady and Trish 's story ending after Nero and the three Devil Hunters finishes all the remaining demons in Castle Town of Fortuna , just as Dante reunites with Trish and Lady before departing , they saw Nero and Kyrie share their kiss without notice that Dante , Trish and Lady are still there watching them kissing before the Devil Hunters ' departure . 
 In the post credits scene , Lady makes a stop at the Devil May Cry office . She had hired Dante and Trish to investigate The Order 's intentions but gives them a small reward for giving them Sparda to the Order in an attempt to get close to them . The three stop arguing after receiving a call involving a new job .

 Producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi noted that the production team began working with the game using a PC @-@ based engine . He said that this was the first PlayStation 3 game developed by Capcom , and that making this transition was a " hard step " , particularly because no member of the producing team was familiar with the console 's capabilities . As the first Devil May Cry not to be released for PlayStation 2 , the team wanted to introduce a new character for newcomers . This allowed them to try new play mechanics that and expand more the series ' plot . On September 6 , 2006 , Japanese video game magazine Famitsu reported that the past games ' main character , Dante , would not be the protagonist in Devil May Cry 4 . Instead , a new character named Nero , voiced and motion captured by Johnny Yong Bosch , took the lead . 
 The game 's multi @-@ platform crossover was justified by emphasizing the Xbox 360 's success in the North American and European markets , labeling the move as " natural " . The final game uses Capcom 's internally developed MT Framework engine . In a thread questioning the move on the official Capcom message board , the company 's senior director of strategic planning and research , Christian Svensson , responded by saying that they were moved by people 's strong feelings about the decision , but that it was the best decision for the company and consumers . He also claimed that the contents would be identical , except that " the feel of the controller " may cause a slight difference . 
 <unk> said in the Famitsu article that the visuals attempt to deliver a satisfying feel of being in the air , and that the actions of Nero 's Devil Bringer could not be done on contemporary generation consoles , but they could be done on the new generation of consoles such as the PlayStation 3 ; . Kobayashi stated that the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would be identical , although he did not comment on the PC version . Kobayashi confirmed that the PC version " would be great , because the same team is working on both " . The PlayStation 3 version requires the user to install <unk> of game data , taking 20 minutes , which shortens the length of the loading screens throughout the game . 
 During production , new gameplay options were implemented in order to " keep up with fresh action games " ; among these is the Devil Bringer 's ability to bring enemies towards the characters . Unlike Dante 's progress in Devil May Cry 3 , Nero was designed to become stronger by upgrading his Devil Bringer ability instead of receiving new weapons after defeating boss characters . During development , the production team noted several aspects of the game , including that Nero would be one of two main characters and that Dante was not going to be the only character from previous entries in the series to appear . Producer Hiroyuki Kobashi noted prior to the release of that game that they wanted to make Dante seem significantly more powerful than Nero . This was done in order to create an evident difference between the strength of a " veteran " when compared to a " rookie " . Unlike Devil May Cry 3 , the game 's difficulty would be the same in both the Japanese and European versions as in the one released in North America . 
 Before commencing the designs for the characters in Devil May Cry 4 , character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with several members of the staff that had worked in the series previously , in order to become familiar with previous elements . The characters were designed in order to emphasize their moves , which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design . Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels . These characters were designed to be attractive to the game 's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game . Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them , but that Nero 's design was one of the biggest challenges he had experienced in his career , based on the fact that the character would have to be accepted by the public and fit in the series ' universe . 
 The soundtrack for Devil May Cry 4 was composed by Tetsuya Shibata , Shusaku Uchiyama , Kento Hasegawa , Akihiko Narita , Kota Suzuki , Rei Kondoh , Masayoshi " <unk> " Ishi , Masami Ueda and Shinichiro Sato .

 The first teaser trailer was shown at E3 2005 , depicting Dante traveling through a snow @-@ covered environment . A more substantial trailer was released at that year 's Tokyo Game Show , with a more rugged and older Dante in a city @-@ like setting . Both teasers show very little detail of the game itself .

 Devil May Cry 4 received positive reviews from critics . Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 84 @.@ 13 % and 84 / 100 , the Xbox 360 version 83 @.@ 26 % and 84 / 100 and the PC version 80 @.@ 05 % and 78 / 100 . 
 Xbox World Australia gave the game 90 / 100 , saying " Devil May Cry 4 is everything a hack @-@ and @-@ slash should be and then some . Sadly it falters with repeated level design and a moderately troublesome camera ; but in the grand scheme of things , these are only minor flaws . " PSM3 gave the game an 80 out of 100 . The magazine discussed the difficulty of the game , saying , " Most games these days tend to hold your hand all the way through ... Devil May Cry is not like that . It 'll throw a million demons at you because it wants to , put in half a dozen arbitrary fights in a 30 @-@ foot stretch of map , force you to survive for ages on a tiny sliver of health ... and then give you a D at the end of the level because you weren 't doing enough combos . " 
 1UP.com graded it A- , praising the gameplay and " predictably slick " looks , but criticized the " divisive industrial hard @-@ rock nonsense .... that sullied DMC3 [ and ] returns here " and the game 's " overly frugal approach to level design " . GameTrailers rated it an 8 @.@ 6 / 10 , and praised the voice acting while criticizing the corny dialogue . IGN gave it an 8 @.@ 7 saying , " Whether it 's on the PS3 or the 360 , action fans are going to get one incredible experience with this game , and if you own either system , you 'll have a great time . " However , the review also noted that , contrary to Kobayashi 's claim , " Dante simply doesn 't have nearly as many weapons as he did in DMC3 " and found that " the amount of backtracking and repetition makes the game feel somewhat half @-@ heartedly finished in the design department . " GameSpy gave it 4 stars out of 5 , stating that " <unk> succeeds on many levels because it fuses fan service with entertaining gameplay " , finding that " visually , <unk> is a dynamo . " The review also praised Nero for " [ bringing ] something fresh to the franchise " and being " as diverse as DMC3 SE 's Vergil " ; however , they also claim that " it cheapens things a little to see that the team has opted to recycle assets in lieu of showing us more of this rich world " and call out the " annoying industrial @-@ meets @-@ butt @-@ rock soundtrack " . Hyper 's Dirk Watch commends the game for " looking great , combos galore and being more fun than Devil May Cry 3 " . However , he criticized it for " still playing like Devil May Cry 2 as well as choppy pacing and level design " . 
 The series ' original creator , Hideki Kamiya , said he used this game as a research when developing Bayonetta , an action game that would use a similar style and which borrowed elements from the Devil May Cry series . In 2010 , the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die .

 Capcom expected Devil May Cry 4 to ship 1 @.@ 8 Million Units by the end of its respected fiscal year .

 In July 2015 , Capcom announced the Special Edition sold well , with the majority of units sold digitally . They further cited that the digital sales of the " Special Edition " were a key contributor to their overall growth for the fiscal quarter .

 Following the game 's popularity , a two @-@ volume novel adaptation of the game named Devil May Cry 4 : Deadly Fortune was released in 2009 by Capcom . It is a two @-@ volume graphic novel written by Bingo Morihashi and his assistant writer Yasui <unk> . 
 The novel covers the story of Devil May Cry 4 , and the events that happened before it . It expands Nero 's backstory as it is revealed he was abandoned in Fortuna when he was baby . An unidentified character ( strongly hinted to be Dante 's brother Vergil ) following Sparda 's footsteps also appears in the novel first in a flashback when Nero was found in Fortuna as well as in a dream before Nero wields Yamato for the first time . During the novel Nero is often compared with Vergil ; Dante is unable to understand the connection between the two . The ending is also expanded as Nero opens his own demon hunting business after the Order of the Sword . In the afterword , Bingo wrote that these removed scenes were intended to be included in the game , but were not due to some production reasons . 
 = 2003 Insight Bowl = 
 The 2003 Insight Bowl was a post @-@ season American college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the California Golden Bears at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix , Arizona , on December 26 , 2003 . The game was the final contest of the 2003 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season for both teams , and ended in a 52 – 49 victory for California . Cal and Virginia Tech combined for 101 points ; only the 2001 GMAC Bowl saw more points scored by two teams in a bowl game without overtime . 
 During the 2003 college football season , Virginia Tech accumulated an 8 – 4 regular @-@ season record that included four losses in the Hokies ' final six regular @-@ season games . As the third @-@ place team in the Big East Conference , Tech accepted a bid to the 2003 Insight Bowl . Facing the Hokies were the California Golden Bears , who went 7 – 6 during the regular season , tying for third place in the Pacific @-@ 10 ( Pac @-@ 10 ) . 
 The 2003 Insight Bowl kicked off at 8 : 30 p.m. EST on December 26 , 2003 . From the beginning of the game , it was a quick @-@ paced , high @-@ scoring contest . In the first quarter , Virginia Tech jumped out to a 21 – 7 lead courtesy of the Tech passing game , which was coordinated by quarterback Bryan Randall , who threw four touchdowns during the game . In the second quarter , California recovered from its 14 @-@ point first @-@ quarter deficit by scoring two touchdowns . Tech , meanwhile , scored another , and took a 28 – 21 lead into halftime . 
 The offensive onslaught continued in the second half , though it was California who took the advantage at first . Bolstered by an improved defensive effort that held the Hokies scoreless throughout the third quarter , California and quarterback Aaron Rodgers scored 21 unanswered points to take a 42 – 28 lead into the fourth quarter . In that quarter , the Hokies clawed back into competition . Tech scored a touchdown to begin the quarter , but Cal answered with one of its own , making the score 49 – 35 . The Hokies evened the score at 49 – 49 after an 80 @-@ yard touchdown drive that took less than two minutes and a punt return by DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown . The post @-@ score Tech kickoff went out of bounds , giving the Bears possession at their 35 @-@ yard line . With time running out , Cal began to drive for a game @-@ winning score . Cal needed just seven plays to advance 47 yards and set up a field goal attempt . As time expired , kicker Tyler Fredrickson kicked a 35 @-@ yard field goal to give California the 52 – 49 win . 
 = = Team selection = = 
 In 2003 , the Insight Bowl contracted with the Big East conference and Pacific @-@ 10 conference to select teams for participation in its annual game . Big East champion Miami was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth , and second @-@ place Pittsburgh accepted a bid to the Continental Tire Bowl in Charlotte , North Carolina . Continental Tire Bowl officials considered inviting Virginia Tech to participate in the game , but were required to invite Virginia due to the Continental Tire Bowl 's contract with the Atlantic Coast Conference . Rather than selecting two teams that faced each other in the final game of the regular season , Continental Bowl officials chose another team . The other possibility for the Hokies was the San Francisco Bowl , whose managers also held a contract with the Big East , but because Tech played in the previous year 's San Francisco Bowl , the bowl 's organizing committee decided against a second invitation . 
 California 's route to the Insight Bowl was less roundabout . In the Pac @-@ 10 , first @-@ place Southern California was awarded the conference 's Bowl Championship Series bid . Second @-@ place Washington State was selected by the Holiday Bowl , and Oregon , tied for third place with California , received a bid to the Sun Bowl . Oregon had a better overall record than California and also won the teams ' head @-@ to @-@ head matchup . 
 = = = Virginia Tech = = = 
 Virginia Tech entered the 2003 college football season having gone 10 – 4 the previous season , including a season @-@ ending victory over Air Force in the inaugural San Francisco Bowl . During the offseason , the Hokies were extended an invitation to join the Atlantic Coast Conference and accepted , making the 2003 season their final year in the Big East . In the annual preseason poll of reporters covering Big East football , Virginia Tech was picked to finish third in the conference , behind the previous year 's champion , Miami , and Pittsburgh . 
 Virginia Tech 's first game of the season was at home against Central Florida on August 31 . In a game that saw the debut of quarterback Marcus Vick , brother of former star Hokie Michael Vick , 10th @-@ ranked Virginia Tech pulled out to an early lead before Central Florida fought back in the second half . Tech recovered , however , and won the game , 48 – 29 . Virginia Tech followed the victory with five others . On October 11 , a fourth @-@ ranked Hokie squad easily won against Syracuse University , 51 – 7 , giving Virginia Tech a 6 – 0 record . 
 In its seventh game , Tech suffered its first loss . Traveling to Morgantown , West Virginia , home of West Virginia University , the third @-@ ranked Hokies lost 28 – 7 to the No. 23 Mountaineers . The loss was Tech 's worst since November 2001 , and knocked the previously undefeated Hokies out of contention for the national championship . The Hokies returned home to face another high @-@ ranking opponent , No. 2 Miami . Recovering from the loss against West Virginia , the Hokies delivered one of the highest @-@ profile wins in school history , defeating the second @-@ ranked Hurricanes 31 – 7 . The game ended a 39 @-@ game regular @-@ season winning streak by Miami and was Tech 's first victory over a top @-@ eight team in 34 games . 
 Tech 's fortunes declined dramatically following the victory over Miami . The week after that win , Tech lost 31 – 28 to Pittsburgh , then escaped with a one @-@ point win in overtime against Temple University , which had just one win that season . Tech 's win against Temple was its last in the regular season . The Hokies lost their final two regular @-@ season games , dropping their overall record to 8 – 4 . To some Virginia Tech fans , the Insight Bowl invitation accepted on December 1 was a disappointment after a season that began with hopes of participation in the national championship game .

 The California Golden Bears earned a 7 – 5 record in 2002 , a year that culminated with a 30 – 7 victory over traditional rival Stanford in the Big Game . It was California 's first winning season since 1993 , and came on the heels of a 1 – 10 season in 2001 . New head coach Jeff Tedford was praised for turning the program around so quickly , and expectations were high heading into the 2003 season . Tedford was awarded a new five @-@ year contract in the offseason , and in the annual preseason poll of media covering the Pac @-@ 10 conference , Cal was picked to finish eighth in the 10 @-@ team organization . 
 In the Bears ' first game of the season , California traveled to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City , Missouri , to face No. 10 Kansas State for the 2003 BCA Classic . There , California lost 42 – 28 in the season opener for both teams . California recovered from the loss in its next game , outscoring the visiting Southern Miss Golden Eagles 34 – 2 . Despite the Bears ' success against Southern Miss , they struggled in their next two games , losing to both Colorado State and Utah . Traveling to the Midwest to face Big 10 opponent Illinois , California debuted a new quarterback : Aaron Rodgers . Rodgers had success late in California 's game against Utah , but did not earn the win . Against Illinois , however , he orchestrated a California offense that emerged victorious , 31 – 24 . 
 The week after the Illinois game , California faced its toughest opponent of the season : third @-@ ranked Southern California . The USC Trojans were undefeated heading into their game against the Bears and on an 11 @-@ game winning streak , but California maintained a lead throughout the game . During the fourth quarter , however , USC rallied to tie California and force overtime , then second and third <unk> when the score remained tied . At the end of the third overtime , California kicker Tyler Fredrickson 's 38 @-@ yard field goal kick was successful , and the Bears earned a 34 – 31 victory . It was California 's first home victory over a top five team since 1975 , and turned out to be USC 's only loss of the season . California lost its next two games , but then won four of its final five , completing the regular season with a record of 7 – 6 and earning a spot in the Insight Bowl . 
 California head coach Jeff Tedford said , " Playing in a bowl game was one of our primary goals this year , so today 's announcement represents a milestone for this team and the Cal football program . " The Insight Bowl would be California 's first bowl game appearance since 1996 .

 In the weeks leading up to the game , media coverage focused on Virginia Tech 's lack of motivation heading into the game . The Hokies were ranked among the top five teams in the country earlier in the season , and had higher expectations than the Insight Bowl , a factor some commentators speculated could cause a distraction . The game was Virginia Tech 's first in the state of Arizona , and its first against a Pac @-@ 10 team . California played in the 1990 Copper Bowl , the name of the Insight Bowl before a name change in the mid @-@ 1990s .

 Virginia Tech running back Kevin Jones drew media attention one day after Virginia Tech 's selection for the Insight Bowl by announcing that he would be foregoing his final year of school in favor of entering the NFL Draft .

He was picked ahead of Bears quarterback Aaron Rodgers , who finished the season with 2 @,@ 509 passing yards and 17 touchdowns despite starting the season as the team 's backup player in that position . He outplayed original starting quarterback Reggie Robertson and replaced him during most of the second half of the season . 
 Rodgers ' favorite passing target was wide receiver Geoff McArthur , who was the Bears ' leading receiver during the regular season , catching 85 passes for a school @-@ record 1 @,@ 504 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns . In one of the Bears ' final practices before the Insight Bowl , however , McArthur fractured his right forearm and was unable to play . McArthur recorded the third @-@ highest receiving total for a Pac @-@ 10 player and had the second @-@ highest average receiving yards per game in the country during the regular season .

 During practice before the game , California kicker Tyler Fredrickson practiced kicking the ball high to avoid what was expected to be a difficult Virginia Tech kick @-@ blocking attack . During the regular season , Fredrickson had five kicks blocked and successfully converted just 14 of 29 field goal attempts .

Arrington , Rodgers cut Virginia Tech 's lead to 28 – 21 with 30 seconds remaining . Virginia Tech took over after the kickoff at its 31 @-@ yard line . Kevin Jones ran for 15 yards and Bryan Randall completed a 30 @-@ yard pass to drive Tech into California territory . Tech was unable to advance the ball further , but kicker Carter Warley was sent in to attempt a 45 @-@ yard field goal . As time expired in the first half , Warley 's kick missed , denying the Hokies a chance to extend their lead . At the end of the first half , Virginia Tech still held a 28 – 21 lead .

 Because California received the ball to begin the game , Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half . Virginia Tech 's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40 yards . Bryan Randall got off to a good start , completing two passes for 26 yards , and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16 yards . After pushing inside the California red zone , however , the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down . Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game — this one a 28 @-@ yard kick — but as before , the kick was no good . 
 After the missed kick , California took over at its 12 @-@ yard line . Aaron Rodgers completed three passes for 58 yards and Arrington added 15 yards on an end @-@ around run . It took California 2 : 44 in game time to advance 88 yards for a touchdown . The score tied the game at 28 – 28 with 10 : 12 to go in the quarter . Tech received the post @-@ touchdown kickoff and gained two quick first downs , but after advancing the ball beyond its own 40 @-@ yard line , was forced to punt it back to California . 
 With the momentum shifting in the Golden Bears ' favor and a chance to take the lead , it took California three plays to earn a touchdown from its 34 @-@ yard line . Rodgers completed a 42 @-@ yard pass , then a 14 @-@ yard pass , and Adimchinobe Echemandu ran the ball in to the end zone from the Virginia Tech 10 @-@ yard line . The score gave California its first lead since the first drive of the game , and with 5 : 52 remaining in the quarter , the scoreboard read 35 – 28 , California . Following the touchdown , Virginia Tech received the ball and had its first three and out of the game . Tech was forced to punt after running three plays for four yards . 
 California received the ball at its 41 @-@ yard line and used the good field position to its advantage . After two short @-@ gain plays , Rodgers completed a 16 @-@ yard pass and a 24 @-@ yard toss to drive the Bears inside the Virginia Tech 20 @-@ yard line . Echemandu rushed the ball twice for seven total yards , then Rodgers ran it himself the remaining nine yards for another California touchdown . The touchdown and extra point gave California a 42 – 28 lead , its largest in the game . Virginia Tech received the ball with 41 seconds remaining in the quarter , and ran four quick plays . After Bryan Randall threw two incompletions , he connected with Ernest Wilford on a long 23 @-@ yard pass , and Kevin Jones rushed up the middle of the field for another 12 yards . As time expired in the quarter , Tech was inside California territory for the first time since the beginning of the quarter and had a first down . At the end of the third quarter , California held a 42 – 28 lead . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 Virginia Tech opened the fourth quarter in possession of the ball , facing a first down at the California 45 @-@ yard line . Two short plays resulted in seven yards , then Kevin Jones rushed for a 15 @-@ yard gain . On the next play , Bryan Randall completed a 22 @-@ yard toss to receiver Keith Willis for a touchdown . The score and extra point cut California 's lead to 42 – 35 , and there were 13 minutes and 35 seconds remaining in the game . 
 California received the ball at its 35 @-@ yard line following the post @-@ touchdown kickoff and a short return . The Bears began to run out the clock , rushing the ball more than passing it , as had been the trend throughout the game . Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38 yards , J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed the ball a total of eight times during the possession . California ran 7 : 09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13 @-@ yard rush that resulted in a touchdown . The score restored California 's 14 @-@ point lead , making the game 49 – 35 with 6 : 26 remaining . 
 Needing to score quickly , Virginia Tech 's subsequent drive consisted primarily of pass plays . Marcus Vick quarterbacked the first play of the drive , but his pass fell incomplete and he was replaced by Bryan Randall on subsequent plays . Randall completed his first three passes of the drive for 46 yards , pushing the Hokies into California territory . Kevin Jones picked up another first down on two rushes , then Randall completed a 28 @-@ yard pass to Chris Shreve for a touchdown that cut California 's lead to 49 – 42 . The drive took just two minutes off the clock , leaving 4 : 26 remaining in the game . California received the post @-@ touchdown kickoff and went three and out , leaving plenty of time for a potential game @-@ tying Virginia Tech drive . 
 This turned out to be unnecessary , however , as Tyler Fredrickson 's punt was returned 52 yards by Virginia Tech 's DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown . Hall 's return tied the game at 49 – 49 , and with 3 : 11 remaining in the game , California took over on offense . On his first play after receiving Virginia Tech 's post @-@ touchdown kickoff , Aaron Rodgers was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball . The Bears ' Chris Murphy jumped on the ball , preventing what otherwise might have been a game @-@ losing turnover . Rodgers recovered from the fumble by completing three straight passes : first to J. J. Arrington for 11 yards , then to Brandon Hall for 18 yards and a first down , then to Burl Toler for 22 yards and another first down . The last play took California deep into Virginia Tech territory . At the Tech 20 @-@ yard line , Rodgers rushed for a five @-@ yard gain , then prepared the offense for a potential game @-@ winning field goal kick . With two seconds remaining on the clock , California called timeout and sent in kicker Tyler Fredrickson . Despite an attempt by Virginia Tech to ice the kicker by calling its final timeout , Fredrickson was undeterred by the pressure and his 35 @-@ yard field goal sailed through the goalposts as time expired . The kick gave California three points and the 52 – 49 victory .

 For his performance in the 2003 Insight Bowl , California quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named the offensive player of the game . Rodgers completed 27 of his 35 passes for 394 yards and two touchdowns in the winning effort . Rodgers ' performance tied Cal 's bowl records for most completions , most touchdowns , and most rushing touchdowns , and was the third @-@ highest offensive output by a single player in California history . The victory was California 's first bowl win since a victory over Iowa in the 1993 Alamo Bowl . California kicker Tyler Fredrickson 's game @-@ winning score was his only field goal kick during the game , but he also had seven extra @-@ point kicks for seven points . In addition , he served as California 's punter , kicking the ball 4 times for 159 total punting yards . He set school records for most extra points in a season and most extra points attempted . Virginia Tech kicker Carter Warley missed three field goals : a 40 @-@ yarder , 45 @-@ yarder , and a 28 @-@ yarder . He successfully kicked four extra points for four points .

California wide receiver Chase Lyman led all receivers statistically , finishing with five receptions for 149 yards and a touchdown . Burl Toler had the most California receptions , catching six passes for 84 yards . Lyman 's total was a career high for him and a California bowl game record . 
 Virginia Tech 's offense broke or tied 14 school bowl records , either individually or as a team . In addition to the ones already noted , the Hokies ' 18 first downs by passing , 398 yards passing , 551 yards of total offense , 24 passes completed , 49 points scored and four passing touchdowns were also new school bowl records . Tech 's 26 rushing plays were the fewest in a Virginia Tech bowl game .

 = Betula pendula = 
 Betula pendula , commonly known as silver birch or warty birch , is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae , native to Europe and parts of Asia , though in southern Europe it is only found at higher altitudes . Its range extends into Siberia , China and southwest Asia in the mountains of northern Turkey , the Caucasus and northern Iran . It has been introduced into North America , where it is known as the European white birch , and is considered invasive in some states in USA and in parts of Canada . The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia . 
 The silver birch is a medium @-@ sized deciduous tree that owes its common name to the white peeling bark on the trunk . The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall . The flowers are catkins and the light , winged seed get widely scattered by the wind . The silver birch is a hardy tree , a pioneer species , and one of the first trees to appear on bare or fire @-@ swept land . Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland , the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy . It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber , firewood , tanning , racecourse jumps and brooms . Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties . 
 = = Description = = 
 The silver birch is a medium @-@ sized deciduous tree , typically reaching 15 to 25 m ( 49 to 82 ft ) tall ( exceptionally up to 31 metres ( 102 ft ) ) , with a slender trunk usually under 40 cm ( 16 in ) diameter . The bark on the trunk and branches is golden @-@ brown at first , but later this turns to white as a result of papery tissue developing on the surface and peeling off in flakes . The bark remains smooth until the tree gets quite large , but in older trees , the bark thickens , becoming irregular , dark and rugged . Young branches have whitish resin warts and the twigs are slender , hairless and often pendulous . The buds are small and sticky , and development is <unk> , that is to say the terminal bud dies away and growth continues from a lateral bud . Some shoots are long and bear the male catkins at the tip , while others are short and bear female catkins . The immature male catkins are present during the winter but the female catkins develop in the spring , soon after the leaves unfurl . 
 The leaves have short slender stalks and are 3 to 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) long , triangular with broad , untoothed , wedge @-@ shaped bases , slender pointed tips and coarsely double @-@ toothed , serrated margins . They are sticky with resin at first but this dries as they age leaving small white scales . The foliage is a pale to medium green and turns yellow early in the autumn before the leaves fall . In mid @-@ summer , the female catkins mature and the male catkins expand and release pollen , and wind pollination takes place . The small 1 to 2 mm winged seeds ripen in late summer on pendulous , cylindrical catkins 2 to 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 to 1 @.@ 6 in ) long and 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) broad . The seeds are very numerous and are separated by scales , and when ripe , the whole catkin disintegrates and the seeds are spread widely by the wind . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The silver birch grows naturally from western Europe eastwards to Kazakhstan , the Sakha Republic in Siberia , Mongolia and the Xinjiang province in China , and southwards to the mountains of the Caucasus and northern Iran , Iraq and Turkey . It is also native to northern Morocco and has become naturalised in some other parts of the world . In the southern parts of its range it is mainly found in mountainous regions . Its light seeds are easily blown by the wind and it is a pioneer species , one of the first trees to sprout on bare land or after a forest fire . It needs plenty of light and does best on dry , acid soils and is found on heathland , mountainsides and clinging to crags . Its tolerance to pollution make it suitable for planting in industrial areas and exposed sites . It has been introduced into North America where it is known as the European white birch , and is considered invasive in the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Washington and Wisconsin . It is naturalised and locally invasive in parts of Canada . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The closely related Betula <unk> in northern Asia and Betula <unk> of central Asia are also treated as varieties of silver birch by some botanists , as B. pendula var. <unk> and B. pendula var. <unk> respectively ( see birch classification ) . 
 B. pendula is distinguished from the related downy birch ( B. pubescens , the other common European birch ) in having hairless , warty shoots ( hairy and without warts in downy birch ) , more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins ( more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch ) , and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures ( greyer , less fissured , in downy birch ) . It is also distinguished <unk> , silver birch being diploid ( with two sets of chromosomes ) , whereas downy birch is tetraploid ( four sets of chromosomes ) . Hybrids between the two are known , but are very rare , and being triploid , are sterile . The two have differences in habitat requirements , with silver birch found mainly on dry , sandy soils , and downy birch more common on wet , poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs . Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch , which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe . Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific ( and cause confusion by combining the downy birch 's alternative vernacular name ' white birch ' , with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species ) , but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe . 
 Synonyms include Betula pendula var. <unk> ( <unk> . ) <unk> @-@ Ahti , B. pendula var. <unk> ( <unk> . ) <unk> . , B. pendula var. lapponica ( <unk> . ) <unk> @-@ Ahti , B. <unk> Raf . , B. montana <unk> , B. <unk> <unk> , B. verrucosa <unk> . , B. verrucosa var. lapponica <unk> . , and B. <unk> <unk> . The rejected name Betula alba L. also applied in part to B. pendula , though also to B. pubescens . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The silver birch has an open canopy which allows plenty of light to reach the ground . This allows a variety of mosses , grasses and flowering plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects . Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose ( Primula vulgaris ) , violet ( Viola <unk> ) , bluebell ( Hyacinthoides non @-@ scripta ) , wood anemone ( Anemone <unk> ) and wood sorrel ( <unk> <unk> ) . Small shrubs that grow on the forest floor include <unk> ( Vaccinium <unk> ) and <unk> ( Vaccinium vitis @-@ <unk> ) . Birds found in birch woodland include the chaffinch , tree pipit , willow warbler , nightingale , robin , woodcock , redpoll and green woodpecker . 
 The branches of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch 's brooms growing among them , caused by the fungus Taphrina <unk> . Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus <unk> <unk> and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor . This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship . This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient @-@ poor soils . Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius . It has been shown that , as well as mycorrhiza , the presence of microfauna in the soil assists the growth of the tree , as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients . 
 The larvae of a large number of species of butterflies , moths and other insects feed on the leaves and other parts of the silver birch . In Germany , almost 500 species of insect have been found on silver and downy birch including 106 beetles and 105 lepidopterans , with 133 insect species feeding almost exclusively on birch . Birch dieback disease can affect planted trees , while naturally regenerated trees seem less susceptible . This disease also affects Betula pubescens and in 2000 was reported at many of the sites planted with birch in Scotland during the 1990s . In the United States , the wood is attacked by the bronze birch borer ( <unk> <unk> ) , an insect pest to which it has no natural resistance . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Silver birch is often planted in parks and gardens , grown for its white bark and gracefully drooping shoots , sometimes even in warmer @-@ than @-@ optimum places such as Los Angeles and Sydney . In Scandinavia and other regions of northern Europe , it is grown for forest products such as lumber and pulp , as well as for aesthetic purposes and ecosystem services . It is sometimes used as a pioneer and nurse tree elsewhere . 
 Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no distinct heartwood and is used in making furniture , plywood , veneers , parquet blocks , skis , kitchen utensils and in turnery . It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames . <unk> of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear . Historically , the bark was used for tanning . Bark can be heated and the resin collected ; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires . The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet . The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires . 
 Birch brushwood is used for racecourse jumps and <unk> brooms . In the spring , large quantities of sap rise up the trunk and this can be tapped . It contains around 1 % sugars and can be used in a similar way to maple syrup , being drunk fresh , concentrated by evaporation or fermented into a " wine " . In Sweden , the bark of birch trees was ground up and used to make bark bread , a form of famine food . The removal of bark was at one time so widespread that Carl Linnaeus expressed his concern for the survival of the woodlands . 
 Silver birch is used in traditional medicine as a diuretic and is reputed to be useful in the treatment of high blood pressure , high cholesterol , obesity , gout , kidney stones , nephritis , cystitis , digestive disturbances and respiratory diseases . For these purposes , a decoction of the bark or leaves is generally used . Externally silver birch is used to promote healing , relieve pain and treat inflammations and infections of the skin such as eczema and psoriasis . 
 The outer part of the bark contains up to 20 % <unk> . The main components in the essential oil of the buds are α @-@ copaene ( ~ 10 % ) , germacrene D ( ~ 15 % ) and δ @-@ cadinene ( ~ 13 % ) . Also present in the bark are other <unk> substances which have been shown to have anti @-@ inflammatory , antiviral and anti @-@ cancer properties . 
 The silver birch is Finland 's national tree . Leafy , fragrant boughs of silver birch ( called <unk> or <unk> ) are used to gently beat oneself in the Finnish sauna culture .

 = Thomas Crisp = 
 Skipper Thomas Crisp VC , DSC , RNR ( 28 April 1876 – 15 August 1917 ) was an English posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross . Crisp , in civilian life a commercial fisherman operating from Lowestoft in Suffolk , earned his award after being killed during the defence of his vessel , the armed naval smack His Majesty 's Smack Nelson , in the North Sea against an attack from a German submarine in 1917 . 
 Thomas Crisp 's self – sacrifice in the face of this " unequal struggle " was used by the government to bolster morale during some of the toughest days of the First World War for Britain , the summer and autumn of 1917 , during which Britain was suffering heavy losses at the Battle of Passchendaele . His exploit was read aloud by David Lloyd George in the Houses of Parliament and made headline news for nearly a week . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Thomas Crisp was born into a family of shipwrights and fishermen in Lowestoft , one of ten children to William and Mary Anne Crisp . Although his father was the owner of a successful boatbuilding firm and thus could afford an education for his children , Thomas did not enjoy school , instead showing a " marked preference for quayside adventure to school routine " . Leaving school , Thomas took to the sea , spending several years as a herring fisherman before joining a fishing trawler out of Lowestoft . He was a natural to the work , being a remarkably good sailor , but tired of it quickly and joined the Atlantic steamship SS Mobile , becoming her quartermaster and making several trans – Atlantic voyages . 
 In 1895 , aged 19 , he met and married Harriet Elizabeth Alp and settled with her at 48 Staithe Road in Burgh St. Peter near Lowestoft , where they had two sons and a daughter , including Thomas Crisp Jr . , who would be with his father on the day he won the Victoria Cross . Establishing himself as a fisherman , Thomas Sr. achieved his mate and then skipper qualifications , entitling him to captain a fishing vessel sailing from the port . In 1902 he was taken on by Chambers , one of the largest boat owning families in Lowestoft , to crew and then captain their ketch George Borrow , in which he remained for thirteen years . In 1907 the family moved to Lowestoft while Crisp continued his work at sea , proving one of the most popular fishing captains in Lowestoft and joined on his ketch by his son in 1913 . 
 When the First World War began in July 1914 , Crisp was at sea . Unaware of the outbreak of war , he remained in the North Sea for several days , and was surprised on his return to learn that enemy submarines were expected off the port at any moment . When this threat failed to materialise , Thomas Crisp returned to fishing , considered too old for military service and in an occupation vital to Britain 's food supplies . In late September , the George Borrow passed the HMS Aboukir , HMS Hogue and HMS Cressy just hours before they were all sunk with over a thousand lives by German U @-@ boat U @-@ 9 . Tom Crisp Jr. later wrote of finding bodies in their fishing nets for weeks afterwards . 
 = = War service = = 
 In the spring of 1915 , Tom Crisp Jr. left the vessel to join the Royal Navy . A few weeks later the U – boat threat expected so many months before arrived , as submarines surfaced among the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews in small boats . This offensive was part of a wider German strategy to <unk> Britain of food supplies and took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea . George Borrow was among the victims , sunk in August , although it is not known if Crisp was aboard at the time . While temporarily working in a net factory following the loss of his vessel , he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels , which were to be secretly armed . The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside . In this manner it was hoped they would protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major resources from the regular fleet , in the same manner as Q @-@ ships deployed in the commercial sea lanes . 
 Agreeing to this proposal , Crisp became first a Seaman and by the summer of 1916 a Skipper in the Royal Naval Reserve , arranging for his son to join the crew of his boat , the HM Armed Smack I 'll Try , armed with a 3 – pounder gun . On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea , I 'll Try had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger Boy Alfred . Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes , both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings , although post – war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date . Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of £ 200 for this action , and Crisp was offered a promotion and transfer to an ocean – going Q – ship . He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife 's sudden and terminal illness . She died in June 1917 . 
 = = Victoria Cross action = = 
 In July , I 'll Try was renamed Nelson and Boy Alfred became Ethel & Millie , in an effort to maintain their cover . The boats continued to operate together and Crisp 's crew was augmented with two regular seamen and a Royal Marine rifleman , providing the Nelson with a crew of ten , including Crisp and his son . The smacks set out as usual on 15 August and pulled in a catch during the morning before making a sweep near the Jim Howe Bank in search of cruising enemies . At 2 @.@ 30 pm , Crisp spotted a German U @-@ boat on the surface 6 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) away . The U @-@ boat also sighted the smack and both vessels began firing at once , the U @-@ boat 's weapon scoring several hits before Nelson 's could be brought to bear . By this stage in the war , German submarine captains were aware of the decoy ship tactics and no longer stopped British merchant shipping , preferring to sink them from a distance with gunfire . 
 With such a heavy disparity in armament between the smack 's 3 pounder and the submarine 's 88 mm deck gun the engagement was short lived , the submarine firing eight shots before the Nelson could get within range of her opponent . The fourth shot fired by the U @-@ boat holed the smack , and the seventh tore off both of Crisp 's legs from underneath him . Calling for the confidential papers to be thrown overboard , Crisp dictated a message to be sent by the boat 's four carrier pigeons : like many small ships of the era , the Nelson did not possess a radio set . 
 " Nelson being attacked by submarine . Skipper killed . Jim Howe Bank . Send assistance at once . " 
 The sinking smack was abandoned by the nine unwounded crew , who attempted to remove their captain , who ordered that he should be thrown overboard rather than slow them down . The crew refused to do so , but found they were unable to move him and left him where he lay . He died in his son 's arms a few minutes later . It is said that he was smiling as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him . The Ethel & Millie had just arrived on the scene as the Nelson sank , and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for Nelson 's lifeboat to come alongside . Realising that this would greatly <unk> the second boat , the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine , coming under lethal fire as he did so . His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink . 
 The crew of the Ethel & Millie then abandoned their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine , where the Nelson survivors last saw them standing in line being addressed by a German officer . The seven British sailors of the Ethel & Millie were never seen again , and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance . Prevailing opinion at the time was that they were murdered and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies , but these scenarios cannot be substantiated . Another theory is that they were taken prisoner aboard the boat and killed when the submarine was itself sunk . The son of Arthur <unk> , a sailor who disappeared in this incident , later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a spiritual medium , reporting that he had died on board the German vessel . UC 63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels . 
 The survivors of the Nelson drifted for nearly two days until they arrived at the Jim Howe Buoy , where they were rescued by the fishery protection vessel Dryad . A pigeon named " Red Cock " had reached the authorities in Lowestoft with news of the fate of the boats and caused the Dryad to be despatched to search for survivors . Following their rescue , the whole of Nelson 's crew were extensively debriefed following medical treatment for exposure and minor injuries . 
 A court of enquiry praised the surviving crew and their dead captain and authorised the award of the Victoria Cross posthumously to Thomas Crisp and Distinguished Service Medals to his son and another member of the crew . On 29 October 1917 , David Lloyd George made an emotional speech in the House of Commons citing Crisp 's sacrifice as representative of the Royal Navy 's commitment " from the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean to the stormy floods of Magellan " , which promoted Crisp into an overnight celebrity whose story ran in all the major London papers for nearly a week , containing as it did a story of personal sacrifice , filial devotion and perceived German barbarity . The medal presentation was made to Tom Crisp Jr. at Buckingham Palace on 19 December 1917 , shortly before he was promoted to Skipper in his own right . 
 Thomas Crisp , VC , DSC , is buried with his wife in Lowestoft Cemetery . 
 = = Post – war remembrance = = 
 After the war , a small display to the memory of Thomas Crisp Sr. was set up in Lowestoft free library and another in Lowestoft Maritime Museum . The former contained a specially commissioned painting and parts of the sunken Nelson , which were dredged up years later . This display was destroyed during the Second World War when the building was gutted in the Blitz . A new display featuring a replica of the Victoria Cross awarded to Tom Crisp currently stands in Lowestoft town hall . The original is held secure by the local council after the family of Skipper Crisp felt his interests would not be served if the medal were held privately . It can be viewed on request of <unk> District Council 's Chief Executive . Thomas Crisp 's name is inscribed on the Chatham Naval Memorial for those lost at sea during the First World War , as well as two church memorials in Lowestoft to the town 's war dead , St. John 's and St. Margaret 's . The latter church also contains a " VC Bell " dedicated to Thomas Crisp 's memory . Tom Crisp Way , a street in his native Lowestoft , is named in his honour . 
 In a footnote to the action , the pigeon " Red Cock " , which brought news of the engagement to the authorities , was stuffed upon his death and was mounted in the Thomas Crisp display at Lowestoft town hall for many years before being reportedly relocated to a museum in South Kensington . 
 = The Bill = 
 The Bill is a British police procedural television series , first broadcast on ITV from 16 October 1984 until 31 August 2010 . The programme originated from a one @-@ off drama , Woodentop , broadcast in August 1983 . 
 In its final year on air , The Bill was broadcast once a week , usually on Tuesdays or Thursdays , in a one @-@ hour format . The programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of police officers , rather than on any particular aspect of police work . The Bill was the longest @-@ running police procedural television series in the United Kingdom , and among the longest running of any British television series . The title originates from " Old Bill " , a slang term for the police . 
 Although highly acclaimed by fans and critics , the series attracted controversy on several occasions . An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis . The series has also faced more general criticism concerning its levels of violence , particularly prior to 2009 , when it occupied a pre @-@ watershed slot . 
 The Bill won several awards , including BAFTAs , a Writers ' Guild of Great Britain award and Best Drama at the Inside Soap Awards in 2009 , this being the series ' fourth consecutive win . 
 Throughout its twenty @-@ seven @-@ year run , the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV network . In later years , episodes of the show were repeated on ITV3 on their week of broadcast . The series has also been repeated on other digital stations , including Gold , Alibi , Watch , Dave and Drama . 
 In March 2010 , executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission The Bill , and that filming on the series would cease on 14 June 2010 . The last episode aired on 31 August 2010 . 
 = = History = = 
 The Bill was originally conceived by Geoff McQueen in 1983 , then a relatively new television writer , as a one @-@ off drama . McQueen had originally titled the production " Old Bill " . It was picked up by Michael Chapman for ITV franchise holder Thames Television , who retitled it " Woodentop " as part of Thames ' " Storyboard " series of one @-@ off dramas and was broadcast on ITV under the title Woodentop on 16 August 1983 . Woodentop starred Mark Wingett as Police Constable Jim Carver and <unk> Goodwin as Woman Police Constable June Ackland of London 's Metropolitan Police , both attached to the fictional Sun Hill police station . 
 Although originally only intended as a one @-@ off , Woodentop impressed ITV to the extent that a full series was commissioned , first broadcast on 16 October 1984 with one post @-@ watershed episode per week , featuring an hour @-@ long , separate storyline for each episode of the first three series . The first episode of the full series was " Funny Ol ' Business – Cops & Robbers " . With serialisation , the name of the show changed from " Woodentop " to " The Bill " . In its first four years the series was broadcast between July onwards each year , with a 12 @-@ week summer break from May until the next July . 
 The series then changed to two episodes , each of thirty minutes on Tuesdays and <unk> , per week in 1988 ( from July 1988 onwards , the series also began being broadcast all year round without a summer break ) , increasing to three a week beginning in 1993 , with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays . In 1998 , The Bill returned to hour @-@ long episodes , which later became twice @-@ weekly , with the Friday episode , being dropped , at which point the series adopted a much more serialised approach . When Paul Marquess took over as executive producer in 2002 , as part of a drive for ratings , the series was revamped , bringing in a more soap opera type feel to many of its stories . Many veteran characters were written out , leading to the Sun Hill fire during 2002 . Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce " plausible , powerful new characters " . As part of the new serial format , much more of the characters ' personal lives were explored , however , as Marquess put it , the viewers still " don 't go home with them " . The change also allowed The Bill to become more reflective of modern policing with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities , most notably the new superintendent , Adam <unk> . It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant Craig Gilmore and PC Luke Ashton , a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival Merseybeat . 
 In 2005 , Johnathan Young took over as executive producer . The serial format was dropped and The Bill returned to stand @-@ alone episodes with more focus on crime and policing than on the personal lives of the officers . 2007 saw the reintroduction of episode titles , which had been dropped in 2002 . In 2009 , The Bill moved back to the 9 pm slot it previously held and the theme tune , " Overkill " , was replaced as part of a major overhaul of the series . 
 = = = Cancellation = = = 
 On 26 March 2010 , ITV announced it would be cancelling the series later that year after 26 years on air . ITV said that this decision reflected the " changing tastes " of viewers . The last episode of The Bill was filmed in June 2010 and broadcast on 31 August 2010 followed by a documentary titled Farewell The Bill . Fans of the show started a ' Save the Bill ' campaign on social networking website Facebook in an effort to persuade ITV to reconsider the cancellation , and some radio broadcasters , including BBC Radio One 's Chris Moyles , presented special features on the programme 's cancellation . 
 At the time of the series ' end in August 2010 , The Bill was the United Kingdom 's longest @-@ running police drama and was among the longest @-@ running of any British television series . The series finale , entitled " Respect " , was aired in two parts and was dedicated to " the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Service past and present " . The finale storyline concerned gang member Jasmine Harris being involved in the murder of fellow member Liam Martin who died in the arms of Inspector Smith after being stabbed . Jasmine is then gang raped because she talked to the police and when Callum Stone found the person responsible he was held at gunpoint . Of the title for the finale , Executive Producer Johnathan Young said " It 's called " Respect " and we hope it will respect the heritage of the show " . The finale episodes featured all the cast and the final scene was specially written so all cast members would be featured . Following the final episode , ITV aired a documentary entitled Farewell The Bill which featured interviews from past and present cast and crew members . The finale was watched by 4 @.@ 4 million viewers , with Farewell The Bill averaging 1 @.@ 661 million viewers . 
 = = Broadcasting and production = = 
 = = = Filming locations = = = 
 Throughout the series , there have been three filming locations for Sun Hill police station . From the first series , the police station consisted of a set of buildings in Artichoke Hill , Wapping , East London . However , these buildings were next to the News International plant and during the winter of 1985 – 86 there was much industrial action which resulted in some altercations between the strikers and what they thought were the real police but were actually actors working on The Bill . Working conditions got so dire , that the production team realised they needed to find another base to set Sun Hill police station . 
 The second location was an old record distribution depot in Barlby Road , North Kensington in North West London . Filming began here in March 1987 . In 1989 , the owners of the Barlby Road site ordered The Bill out , due to their redevelopment plans for the area . After an extensive search , two sites were selected , the favourite being a disused hospital in Clapham . However , this fell through and the second option was chosen – an old wine distribution warehouse in Merton , South West London . The move was made in March 1990 and was disguised on screen by the ' ongoing ' refurbishment of Sun Hill police station and then finally the explosion of a terrorist car @-@ bomb in the station car @-@ park , which ended up killing PC Ken Melvin . 
 Filming for the series took place all over London , mainly in South London and particularly the London Borough of Merton , where the Sun Hill set was located . Locations used when the show was filmed on a housing estate included : 
 Cambridge Estate , in Kingston , south @-@ west London 
 High Path Estate , in South Wimbledon , south @-@ west London ( approx . 10 @-@ minute walk from the Sun Hill set ) 
 Phipps Bridge , Mitcham 
 <unk> Estate in Wallington , London 
 Sutton Estate , which includes Durand Close in Carshalton , where a housing block regularly used by The Bill for filming was demolished in November 2009 . 
 Scenes were often filmed in east London , most notably the London Docklands , with other scenes filmed in Tooting , Greenwich and Croydon . 
 = = = = " Sun Hill " = = = = 
 The Bill is set in and around Sun Hill police station , in the fictional " Canley Borough Operational Command Unit " in East London . Geoff McQueen , creator of The Bill , claimed that he named Sun Hill after a street name in his home town of Royston , Hertfordshire . 
 The fictional Sun Hill suburb is located in the fictional London borough of Canley in the East End , north of the River Thames . The Borough of Canley is approximately contiguous to the real @-@ life London Borough of Tower Hamlets , and in the first few years of The Bill , Sun Hill police station was actually stated as being located in Wapping in Tower Hamlets . Sun Hill has a London E1 postcode ( the ' address ' of Sun Hill police station is given as ' 2 Sun Hill Road , Sun Hill , Canley E1 4 km ' . ) , which corresponds to the real @-@ life areas of Whitechapel and Stepney . 
 = = = Production details = = = 
 When filming The Bill , some scenes were re @-@ enacted indoors with microphones surrounding the actors and the extra sounds being " dubbed " on later . Some of the more aggressive scenes were also filmed indoors either for dubbing or safety reasons . When filming scenes involving police cars , a camera was attached to the outside of the car which feeds back images to a digital recorder in the back of the vehicle . This technique was used to film the new opening titles of The Bill . The sirens used in the series were added later in the dubbing suite as The Bill did not have permission to use sirens while on location . However , the police uniforms used in the series were genuine , again making The Bill unique amongst police dramas . When the series ended , London 's Metropolitan Police Service , after talks with the production company , bought 400 kilograms of police related paraphernalia , including flat caps and stab vests etc. to prevent them falling into the hands of criminals or those who would seek to use them for criminal activities after the programme 's production ceased . 
 The Bill is unique amongst police dramas in that it takes a serial format , focussing on the work and lives of a single shift of police officers , rather than on one particular area of police work . Also unique is that The Bill adapted to this format after several series , whereas comparable series started with the serial format .

 During its initial broadcast , The Bill was always shown on ITV . In 2009 , STV , ITV 's regional franchise in Central and Northern Scotland , opted out of broadcasting the series along with a number of other dramas , a decision that later became the subject of legal proceedings between STV and the main ITV network . The legal dispute was settled on 27 April 2011 , with ITV receiving £ 18 million from STV . 
 Aside from repeats of episodes on ITV3 , which occurred on the original week of their broadcast , the show has regularly been repeated on other digital stations . Re @-@ runs of the series began on 1 November 1992 , when new digital channel UKTV Gold began broadcasting . The channel broadcast repeats of the series for nearly sixteen years , until 6 October 2008 , when the channel was given a revamp by the owners of the network . During the sixteen @-@ year period , re @-@ runs of the series covered every episode broadcast between 16 October 1984 , and 8 March 2007 . On 7 October 2008 , UKTV launched a new British drama channel , Alibi , and from this point on , episodes of the series were broadcast in the 8 am slot on the channel . Alibi broadcast episodes until 23 December 2009 , when the show was taken from the channel 's schedule due to poor viewer feedback . During the fourteen months that the show broadcast on Alibi , the channel covered all of the episodes broadcast between 25 August 1998 and 27 February 2002 . On 27 January 2010 , UKTV relocated The Bill to one of its more recent entertainment channels , Watch . Watch began by airing the episode " Sweet Revenge " , broadcast on 21 March 2007 . Thus , they continued in broadcast order , carrying on from where their predecessor , UKTV Gold , had finished . Through the course of the year , the channel continued to broadcast episodes from the latter years of the show , concluding in November 2010 with the episode " Conviction : Judgement Day " , broadcast on 16 July 2009 . Following a short break from the network , the series returned in December 2010 , beginning with Episode # 001 , broadcast on 28 February 2002 . This continued on from the broadcast order of episodes repeated on Alibi , carrying on from where the network had finished . As of April 2012 , Watch had repeated every single episode from 28 February 2002 to 24 February 2005 , and was to begin airing episodes from March 2005 . In July 2013 the show started to be broadcast by UKTV channel Drama , starting with episodes from 1998 .

 = = Themes and title sequences = = 
 The pilot episode of the series , " Woodentop " , featured a short theme composed by Mike Westergaard . The theme was used specifically for the episode and was never used at any time during the main series . The title sequence for the episode consisted simply of the word ' Woodentop ' being spelt out letter by letter , as if someone was writing it on a typewriter . 
 The first ever opening sequence of The Bill was first seen in the episode " Funny Ol ' Business – Cops & Robbers " . The sequence consisted of two police officers , one male and one female , walking down a street , whilst images of Sun Hill were interspersed between them . This sequence was used for the first series only . It featured the first version of the series iconic theme tune , " Overkill " , composed by Charlie Morgan and Andy Pask . The theme is notable for its use of septuple meter . The end titles of the series simply showed the feet of the two police constables pounding the beat . 
 In the second series of the show , the opening sequence consisted of a police car , a Rover SD1 , racing down a street with its siren wailing and its blue flashing light on . The car would screech to a stop , and the camera would zoom in on the blue light . Various clips were then shown from the series of the characters in action , often chasing suspects . This sequence kept the first version of " Overkill " , and also used the same ending credits from series one . This sequence was also used in the third series . 
 From the fourth series onwards , the opening sequence was kept generally the same ; however , clips from the series used were regularly updated to remove departed characters and keep to date with the show 's events . Minor changes to the sequence included the Rover SD1 changing into a Ford Sierra in 1993 , which was replaced by a Vauxhall Vectra in 1997 . In the 1997 sequence , the Vectra was seen overtaking a Leyland Titan bus , before screeching to a halt , and the main sequence starting . The end credits for the series remained the same , but a new version of " Overkill " was used , also composed by Andy Pask and Charlie Morgan . 
 On 6 January 1998 , starting with " Hard Cash " , the third episode of the show 's fourteenth series , the title sequence and theme used for nearly ten years were scrapped . This time , the title sequence consisted of various police procedural images , including a suspect being shown into a police cell , another suspect being interviewed , and a third posing for mug shot photographs . Clips of any of the actors featured were removed , as was the initial sequence involving the police car racing down the street . Pask and Morgan revamped " Overkill " , giving it a jazz feel , with the majority of the theme played by a saxophone . The end credits of the series were also completely revamped . This time , the credits featured various images of the Metropolitan Police uniform , combined with images of a feet tapping on a kerb . A longer version of " Overkill " was also used in the final credits , this time composed by Mark Russell . These opening and closing sequences were used for nearly three years , although both saw minor updates in 1999 . The text sequence at the very start of the opening sequence was changed into a different font , and the images of the police uniform and feet tapping on a curb were removed from the closing sequence to make way for a preview of the next episode . The closing sequence remained this way until 2001 , but the opening titles were once again updated in 2000 to remove certain images from the sequence to make it shorter . It is also noted that during this period , a ' previously on The Bill ' segment was aired before the title sequence , to inform views what had occurred in the last episode . 
 On 20 February 2001 , starting with " Going Under " , the fourteenth episode of the show 's seventeenth series , the opening and closing sequences were once again scrapped to make way for a completely new sequence and theme . This time , the opening sequence consisted of a montage image of the entire cast , backed by a darker , slower version of " Overkill " . The closing credits featured a montage of various police @-@ related images , also backed by the new version of " Overkill " . The opening sequence was designed by the visuals company " Blue " , and the new arrangement of " Overkill " was produced by Miles Bould and Mike Westergaard . These titles remained essentially the same for two years , with two small updates . The font used on the closing credits was changed towards the end of 2001 , and the characters featured in the opening sequence were updated in 2002 , to remove characters who had departed , and include new characters . These titles were broadcast from Episode No. 017 , and are notable as several of the characters in these titles had not yet appeared in the show . DS Samantha Nixon appeared in the titles from Episode No. 017 , but did not first appear until Episode No. 038 , some four months later . 
 On 13 February 2003 , starting with Episode No. 090 , the opening and closing sequences were once again updated . This time , the opening sequence consisted of several generic police images , such as a police car and uniform . A new arrangement of " Overkill " , made by Lawrence Oakley , was also used for both the opening and closing sequences . The background of the closing sequence , designed by company " Roisin at Blue " , was simply a police shade of blue , with all generic images being removed . Throughout its four @-@ year use , these titles were never updated or changed , with the exception of the police shade of blue , which was changed to a dark shade of black in 2006 . 
 On 3 January 2007 , starting with Episode No. 471 , the opening and closing sequences were once again changed . This time , the opening sequence , for the first time , features an image of the " Sun Hill " sign , and returns to featuring images of officers in action . This sequence also featured a further new arrangement of " Overkill " , once again arranged by Lawrence Oakley . This time , the closing sequence follows a police car on patrol , watching it as it drives through the streets of Sun Hill . These titles were used for nearly two and a half years . 
 On 23 July 2009 , after the programme underwent a major overhaul , the opening sequence and theme were heavily changed . This time , the classic " Overkill " theme was completely removed , and a new theme created by Simba Studios was used . However , producer Jonathan Young stated that echoes of " Overkill " can still be heard in the theme . The opening sequence featured a patrol car driving through the streets of Sun Hill . The closing sequence follows the same patrol car , however , this time , from an overhead view . These titles remained the same until the show 's final episode , where the theme tune was replaced by a final version of " Overkill " , in homage to the show .

 The Bill has become a popular drama in the United Kingdom and in many other countries , most notably in Australia . The series attracted audiences of up to six million viewers in 2008 and 2009 . Ratings during 2002 peaked after the overhaul of the show which brought about the 2002 fire episode , in which six officers were killed and the 2003 live episode attracted ten million <unk> forty percent of the UK audience share . Immediately following The Bill 's revamping and time slot change , it was reported that the programme had attracted 4 @.@ 5 million viewers , 19 % of the audience share , however , it lost out to the BBC 's New Tricks with the Daily Mirror later reporting that ITV 's schedule change was behind a two million viewer drop in ratings . 
 In 2001 , prior to Paul Marquess ' appointment as executive producer , The Bill 's ratings had dropped to approximately six million viewers and advertising revenues had fallen , in part due to the ageing demographic of its viewers , leading ITV to order a " rejuvenation " which saw the series adopt a serial format . 
 In 2002 , The Independent reported that The Bill 's Thursday episode was viewed by approximately 7 million people , a fall of approximately 3 million viewers in the space of 6 months . After the cast clearout resulting from the Sun Hill fire in April 2002 , BBC News reported that The Bill attracted 8 @.@ 6 million viewers , the highest figure for the year to that point , and by October 2003 , the program had around 8 million viewers each week . 
 In 2005 , The Bill was averaging around 11 million viewers , in comparison to Coronation Street , which was attracting around 10 million viewers . 
 In 2009 , The Daily Mirror reported that The Bill was to be moved to a post @-@ watershed slot to allow it to cover grittier storylines . It was reported that it is the first time in British Television that ITV have broadcast a drama all year in the 9 pm slot . The changeover happened at the end of July 2009 . Before the move , The Bill was averaging 5 million viewers between the two episodes each week . BARB reports that the week 12 – 18 October 2009 saw 3 @.@ 78 million viewers watch The Bill .

 = = Impact and history = = 
 The Bill was Britain 's longest running police drama . 
 It has been compared to Hill Street Blues due to the similar , serial , format that both series take . However , The Bill has seen little direct competition on British television in the police procedural genre over its twenty @-@ five @-@ year history , though the BBC has twice launched rival series . The first was Merseybeat , which ran from 2001 but was cancelled in 2004 due to poor ratings and problems with the cast . The second , HolbyBlue , launched in 2007 , was a spin @-@ off of successful medical drama Holby City ( itself a spin @-@ off of the long @-@ running Casualty ) . It was scheduled to go " head to head " with The Bill , prompting a brief " ratings war " , however HolbyBlue was also cancelled by the BBC in 2008 , again , largely due to poor ratings . 
 When The Bill started , the majority of the Police Federation were opposed to the programme , claiming that it portrayed the police as a racist organisation , however , feelings towards the programme have now mellowed to the extent that Executive Producer Johnathan Young met with Sir Ian Blair , then Commissioner of the Met in 2006 and it was decided that the editorial relationship between the police and the programme was sufficient . However , Young stressed that The Bill is not " editorially bound " to the police . 
 Despite better relations with the police , The Bill has still not been without controversy . The Bill has been repeatedly criticised for the high levels of violence portrayed in its scenes , especially prior to 2009 when it occupied a pre @-@ watershed timeslot . Specific story lines have also come under fire in the media , such as that surrounding a gay kiss in 2002 , as well as an episode broadcast in March 2008 which featured a fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis , leading the MS Society to brand the plot " grossly irresponsible " . 
 The series has also been criticised by the tabloid press for the replacing of the iconic theme tune as part of a revamping effort .

 = Bleach ( Nirvana album ) = 
 Bleach is the debut studio album by American rock band Nirvana , released on June 15 , 1989 by Sub Pop . The main recording sessions took place at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle , Washington between December 1988 and January 1989 . 
 Bleach was well received by critics , but failed to chart in the U.S. upon its original release . The album was re @-@ released internationally by Geffen Records in 1992 following the success of Nirvana 's second album , Nevermind ( 1991 ) . The re @-@ release debuted at number 89 on the Billboard 200 , and peaked at number 33 on the UK Albums Chart and 34 on the Australian albums chart . In 2009 Sub Pop released a 20th anniversary edition of Bleach featuring a live recording of a Nirvana show in Portland , Oregon from 1990 as extra material . Since its release in 1989 , Bleach has sold more than 1 @.@ 7 million units in the United States alone . It is Sub Pop 's best @-@ selling release to date . 
 = = Recording = = 
 After the release of its debut single " Love Buzz " on Sub Pop in November 1988 , Nirvana practiced for two to three weeks in preparation for recording a full @-@ length album , even though Sub Pop had only requested an EP . The main sessions for Bleach took place at Reciprocal Recording Studios in Seattle , with local producer Jack Endino . 
 Nirvana began recording with a five @-@ hour session on December 24 , 1988 . The band recorded again on December 29 – 31 , and on January 14 and 24 . Three of the album 's songs – " Floyd the Barber " , " Paper Cuts " and " Downer " – were recorded during a previous session at Reciprocal Studios in 1988 , featuring Dale Crover on drums . Despite attempts to re @-@ record them with new drummer Chad Channing , the band ultimately decided to remix the versions recorded with Crover for the final version of Bleach . " Big Long Now " was omitted from the album because vocalist / guitarist Kurt Cobain felt " there was already enough slow heavy stuff on Bleach , and he ' didn 't want that song to go out ' " , according to Endino . The album was edited and sequenced , but Sub Pop head Bruce Pavitt ordered that the album be completely re @-@ sequenced . The record was further delayed for several months until Sub Pop was able to secure sufficient funds to issue it . 
 Nirvana songwriter Kurt Cobain felt pressured to create music for Bleach that conformed to the grunge music style favored by his record label and the contemporary Seattle music scene . The album is regarded as quite negative and bleak ; Cobain claimed that most of the lyrics were written the night before recording while he was feeling " pissed off " , and that he did not regard them highly . 
 Endino billed the band thirty hours of recording at $ 606 @.@ 17 . Jason Everman , a guitarist who was impressed by Nirvana 's demo with Dale Crover , supplied the money . He briefly joined the group as second guitarist . Everman was credited as a guitarist on the album sleeve , and is the other guitarist on the cover of the album , even though he did not perform on the album . Bassist Krist Novoselic explained , " We just wanted to make him feel at home in the band . " 
 = = Music = = 
 According to Cobain , the music on Bleach conformed with the grunge genre Sub Pop heavily endorsed . " There was this pressure from Sub Pop and the grunge scene to play ' rock music ' " , Cobain said , and noted that he " [ stripped ] it down and [ made ] it sound like Aerosmith . " Cobain also felt he had to fit the expectations of the grunge sound to build a fanbase , and hence suppressed his arty and pop songwriting traits while crafting the record . Krist Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in their tour van that had an album by The Smithereens on one side and one by the extreme metal band Celtic Frost on the other , and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well . The songs were described as " deliberately bleak , claustrophobic , and lyrically sparse , with none of the manic derangement or sense of release of the live performance " . Cobain said that the song structures were " one – dimensional " , and said that he sought to present a more " polished and urbane side of happy " . 
 Describing the various songs on Bleach , Christopher Sandford wrote : " ' Paper Cuts ' includes a folk @-@ influence melody and ponderous rhythm of an early Led Zeppelin number ; ' Mr. Moustache ' addressed itself on Nirvana 's male fans ; ' Downer ' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group 's audience " . Sandford felt " School " – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that " served as the rip " . While " <unk> " is " a parting salvo at [ Cobain 's parents ] " , " Negative Creep " was written by Cobain about himself . According to Sandford , " About a Girl " has a " chiming melody and ironic chorus " . In Sounds magazine , Keith Cameron said the song " was exhilarating and it was exciting because that was the nature of the music , but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger , that this whole thing could fall apart any second . There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last " . In his book Nirvana : The Stories Behind Every Song , Chuck <unk> writes that the song " stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject " . 
 In one of his first interviews , Cobain told Sounds journalist John Robb , " When I write a song the lyrics are the least important thing . I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all . Sometimes I try to make things harder for myself , just to try to make myself a bit more angry . I try out a few subconscious things I suppose , like conflicts with other people . Most of the lyrics on the Bleach album are about my life in Aberdeen . " 
 In 1993 , Cobain told Spin that on Bleach he " didn 't give a flying fuck what the lyrics were about " and claimed that 80 percent of the lyrics were written the night before recording . He was often still working on the words on the drive to the recording studio . He explained : " It was like I 'm pissed off . Don 't know what about . Let 's just scream negative lyrics , and as long as they 're not sexist and don 't get too embarrassing it 'll be okay . I don 't hold any of those lyrics dear to me . " Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad noted that , nevertheless , many of the songs on the album reflected Cobain and various incidents in his life . " Mr. Moustache " was inspired by Cobain 's dislike of macho behavior , while " School " was a critique of the Seattle music scene , particularly Sub Pop .
