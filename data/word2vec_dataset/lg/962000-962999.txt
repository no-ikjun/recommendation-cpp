 Singer Gruff Rhys has described " Ysbeidiau Heulog " as " throwaway pop ... old time pop music " , likening the song to the work of ELO and going on to claim that it is a tribute to late 1960s pop bands such as The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes . Rhys has stated that his lyrics are about " looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment " and that " If there 's any song that doesn 't sum up [ Mwng ] it 's [ ' Ysbeidiau Heulog ' ] ! " The track was recorded in 1999 at Famous Studios , Cardiff and was engineered by Greg Haver . Overdubs were added at Ofn studios , Llanfaelog , Wales with the help of Gorwel Owen who also mixed the song at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals . B @-@ side " Charge " was recorded for an episode of BBC Radio 1 's The John Peel Show , which aired on 1 March 2000 . The track was produced for the BBC by Simon Askew and engineered by Nick Fountain .

 " Ysbeidiau Heulog " is 2 minutes 51 seconds long and is in the key of B major . The track begins with an intro with a lead guitar melody , which plays twice , accompanied by drums , bass , distorted rhythm guitar and saxophone . The first verse begins on 14 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines " Fe <unk> ni , ysbeidiau heulog , ysbeidiau heulog " with a vocoder being used on the second " ysbeidiau heulog " . This entire phrase is then repeated , with Rhys accompanied by harmony backing vocals . Throughout this first part of the verse the only instrumentation is a distorted bass guitar and drums . The second half of the verse begins at 28 seconds with rhythm guitar , playing the chords B , B , A and E twice with little sustain , joining the drums and bass , which is no longer distorted . The track breaks down for the first chorus with Rhys singing " ysbeidiau heulog " four times backed by harmony vocals and occasional keyboard noises with the band rejoining on the last " heulog " , the rhythm guitar playing an A chord on each of the word 's two syllables which are emphasised by cymbal crashes . After a drum fill an instrumental passage begins at 53 seconds . This follows the same arrangement as the intro although the lead guitar plays a melody line just once during the second half of the section , simply <unk> for the first half . The second verse starts at 1 minute 8 seconds leading into the second chorus which this time features drums fills and rhythm guitar alongside Rhys ' vocals . A short bridge plays at the end of the chorus with Rhys singing " <unk> ein <unk> ni , heulog tan <unk> <unk> yn <unk> " . Instrumentation is sparse with a guitar , featuring flanging , playing several licks alongside bass and drums , which are heavily affected by flanging . The bridge leads into the third and last chorus , which follows the arrangement of the second chorus although this time the drums feature flanging . The track ends with an instrumental outro similar to the intro . The outro begins at 2 minutes 16 seconds and features a second lead guitar with a wah @-@ wah effect playing licks alongside the main lead guitar and saxophone . After the guitar melody has played twice the main lead guitar stops playing and the track begins to fade out .

 = 2005 Sugar Bowl = 
 The 2005 Sugar Bowl was a postseason American college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Auburn Tigers at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana , on January 3 , 2005 . It was the 71st edition of the annual Sugar Bowl football contest . Virginia Tech represented the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) in the contest , while Auburn represented the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) . In a defensive struggle , Auburn earned a 16 – 13 victory despite a late @-@ game rally by Virginia Tech . 
 Virginia Tech was selected as a participant in the game after winning the ACC football championship during the team 's first year in the conference . Tech , which finished 10 – 2 in the regular season prior to the Sugar Bowl , defeated 16th @-@ ranked Virginia and ninth @-@ ranked Miami en route to the game . Auburn finished the regular season undefeated at 12 – 0 . The Tigers defeated fourth @-@ ranked LSU and fifth @-@ ranked Georgia during the course of the season , and were one of five teams to finish the regular season undefeated ; the others were Southern California , Oklahoma , Utah , and Boise State , with USC and Oklahoma being selected to play in the Bowl Championship Series national championship game . Auburn , by virtue of its lower ranking in the BCS poll , was left out of the national championship and was selected to play in the Sugar Bowl . 
 Pre @-@ game media coverage of the game focused on Auburn being left out of the national championship game , a point of controversy for Auburn fans in the weeks leading up to the game . Much was made of that and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown , each of whom was considered among the best at his position . On the Virginia Tech side , senior quarterback Bryan Randall had a record @-@ breaking season . Both teams also had high @-@ ranked defenses , and Tech 's appearance in the 2000 Sugar Bowl also was mentioned in the run @-@ up to the game . 
 The 2005 Sugar Bowl kicked off on January 3 , 2005 , at 8 : 00 p.m. EST . Early in the first quarter , the Tigers took a 3 – 0 lead . Following an interception by the Auburn defense , the Tigers were extended their lead to 6 – 0 . In the second quarter , another field goal resulted in three points for the Tigers . At halftime , Auburn led , 9 – 0 . Auburn opened the second half with its only touchdown drive of the game , giving Auburn a 16 – 0 lead , which it held into the fourth quarter . In that quarter , Tech scored its first touchdown of the game but did not convert the two @-@ point try , making the score 16 – 6 . Late in the quarter , Tech quarterback Bryan Randall cut Auburn 's lead to 16 – 13 on an 80 @-@ yard pass that resulted in another touchdown . With almost no time remaining in the game , Virginia Tech attempted an onside kick to have another chance on offense . When Auburn recovered the kick , the Tigers ran out the clock and secured the win . In recognition of his game @-@ winning performance , Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell was named the game 's most valuable player . 
 Despite Auburn 's victory and undefeated season , they were not named national champions . That honor went to the University of Southern California , which defeated Oklahoma in the 2005 national championship game , 55 – 19 . Three voters in the final Associated Press poll of the season voted Auburn the number one team in the country , but their votes were not enough to deny USC a national championship , as voted by members of the Associated Press and Coaches ' polls . Several players from each team were selected in the 2005 NFL Draft and went on to careers in the National Football League . 
 = = Team selection = = 
 Virginia Tech and Auburn each earned automatic spots in a BCS bowl game due to their status as conference champions , and were selected by the 2005 Sugar Bowl . Virginia Tech finished the season 10 – 2 and was named ACC football champion its first year in the conference . Auburn , meanwhile , finished the season undefeated at 12 – 0 , and was named champion of the SEC . Controversy erupted around Auburn 's selection , as the Tigers had been denied a spot in the national championship game in favor of two other undefeated teams : the University of Southern California ( USC ) and Oklahoma . 
 = = = Virginia Tech = = = 
 The Virginia Tech Hokies entered the 2004 college football season having gone 8 – 5 in 2003 , culminating with a 52 – 49 loss to California in the 2003 Insight Bowl . The 2003 season had also been Virginia Tech 's final year in the Big East Conference , and Tech began the new season in the Atlantic Coast Conference . Tech started the season unranked for the first time since 1998 , and was picked to finish sixth ( out of 11 ACC teams ) in the annual ACC preseason poll , held in July . The Hokies ' first game in their new conference was a non @-@ conference contest at FedEx Field in Landover , <unk> against the top @-@ ranked USC Trojans . Tech lost , 24 – 13 , but recovered to win its next game — against lightly regarded Western Michigan — in blowout fashion , 63 – 0 . In its first conference game in the ACC , the Hokies beat Duke , 47 – 17 , to improve to a 2 – 1 record . Their first win in the ACC was followed by their first loss , however , as the Hokies lost the next week to North Carolina State , 17 – 16 , when Tech kicker Brandon Pace missed a last @-@ second field goal . 
 Following the loss , Virginia Tech was 2 – 2 on the season , and faced the potential of being ineligible for a postseason bowl game if it did not improve its winning percentage . The Hokies won their next eight games , finishing the season with a 10 – 2 record . With late @-@ season wins over perennial rival , 16th @-@ ranked Virginia , and fellow ACC newcomer , ninth @-@ ranked Miami , Virginia Tech clinched the ACC football championship ( the last year in which it would be decided without a conference championship game ) and a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game . Because the ACC 's normal bowl destination , the Orange Bowl , was hosting the national championship game , Virginia Tech was selected to attend the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans , Louisiana , instead . 
 = = = Auburn = = = 
 Auburn , like Virginia Tech , had gone 8 – 5 during the 2003 college football season , and entered the 2004 season with high expectations . The Tigers were using a new offensive scheme — the West Coast offense — and boasted two highly rated running backs on offense . In its first game of the 2004 season , the 18th @-@ ranked Auburn football team overwhelmed the University of Louisiana @-@ Monroe , 31 – 0 . It was Auburn 's first shutout since 2002 . One week later , the Tigers backed up their good start with an emphatic 43 – 14 victory over Southeastern Conference foe Mississippi State University . In the third week of the season , Auburn faced its first challenge of the young season , against the fourth @-@ ranked Louisiana State Tigers . In a hard @-@ fought defensive struggle , Auburn won , 10 – 9 , when a missed extra point was replayed after a penalty . 
 After an easy 33 – 3 victory over The Citadel , Auburn faced eighth @-@ ranked Tennessee . The Tigers ' defense forced six turnovers en route to a 34 – 10 victory . With the victory over Tennessee , Auburn reeled off another four victories and became a prominent candidate for inclusion in the national championship game . In the 11th week of the season , Auburn faced the fifth @-@ ranked Georgia Bulldogs . After a defensive effort that held Georgia scoreless until late in the fourth quarter , the third @-@ ranked Tigers won a 24 – 6 victory . After defeating Alabama in their final regular @-@ season game , Auburn entered the SEC championship game undefeated and in third place nationally . Although the Tigers defeated the Volunteers , 38 – 28 , in the conference championship game , Auburn remained in third place because both USC and Oklahoma also remained undefeated . With USC and Oklahoma selected to play in the national championship game , Auburn was forced into the Sugar Bowl . With the winner of the BCS Championship Game guaranteed first place in the Coaches Poll , Auburn fans held hopes that the combination of an overwhelming Tigers victory in the Sugar Bowl with Oklahoma defeating USC with a weak performance would cause enough voters in the AP Poll to put Auburn ahead of Oklahoma in their final poll . The result would have been a split national championship similar to what occurred the previous season . 
 = = Pregame buildup = = 
 In the weeks leading up to the game , media coverage of the game focused on Auburn 's exclusion from the national championship game , a controversial point for Auburn fans and other observers in the weeks leading up to the game . In addition , both teams boasted high @-@ ranked defenses that had performed well during the year . Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown , each of whom were considered among the best players at their position . On the Virginia Tech side , senior quarterback Bryan Randall performed well for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl . 
 = = = Rankings controversy = = = 
 Shortly after the final pre @-@ bowl game Bowl Championship Series standings were released on December 4 , Auburn was among several teams disgruntled with the system . One of these was California , which only lost to top @-@ ranked USC , but was denied a bid to the prestigious Rose Bowl after Texas vaulted it in the rankings despite having the same record . The Golden Bears were forced to attend the less @-@ attractive Holiday Bowl instead . The Auburn Tigers , meanwhile , had completed their first 12 @-@ win regular season and won their first conference championship in 15 years , but in the final BCS rankings , Auburn was third , behind USC and Oklahoma . It was the first time since the creation of the BCS in 1998 that three major @-@ conference college football teams were undefeated at the conclusion of the regular season . Some pundits and fans considered Auburn 's failure to reach the championship game to be based on the fact that the Tigers had started with a lower ranking at the beginning of the season . The Tigers had been ranked 17th at the beginning of the season , while USC had been ranked first and Oklahoma second , the same spots they occupied at the end of the regular season . 
 Sportswriters also pointed to the Tigers ' tougher conference schedule when compared to those of USC and Oklahoma . SEC commissioner Mike Slive remarked , " If Auburn goes through this league undefeated , they deserve to play for the national championship . " Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer , in the runup to the game , seemingly agreed with the assessment , saying , " We started out playing Southern Cal and I believe this Auburn team is better . " Some writers also indicated USC 's five @-@ point win — in which the Trojans struggled — over rival UCLA as an indicator that the Tigers could be the better team . In the end , such arguments were unable to sway voters , who ranked USC first , Oklahoma second , and Auburn third in all of the major polls decided by human voters . The Utes , who were also undefeated at the conclusion of the regular season , received limited attention because they were a member of a non @-@ BCS conference . 
 Due to the controversy surrounding Auburn 's failure to be given a chance to play for the national championship and controversies involving teams lobbying for improved ratings in the poll , the Associated Press sent a cease @-@ and @-@ desist order to BCS officials , forbidding them the use of the AP Poll in calculating BCS ratings . 
 = = = Auburn offense = = = 
 Auburn head coach Tommy Tuberville was named the Associated Press Coach of the Year on December 24 , due in large part to his success in using Auburn 's new West Coast offense to drive the Tigers to an undefeated 12 – 0 regular season . In response to his success , Auburn administrators agreed to a seven @-@ year , $ 16 million contract extension with Tuberville prior to the Sugar Bowl . Tuberville planned an offense that finished the regular season averaging 33 @.@ 4 points and 430 @.@ 8 yards of total offense per game . 
 Heading Auburn 's offense on the field was quarterback Jason Campbell . Campbell finished the regular season with 2 @,@ 511 yards and 19 touchdowns , one short of tying the Auburn record for most touchdowns in a single season . Campbell was second in the Southeastern Conference in passing yards per game ( 209 @.@ 2 ) , and was a first @-@ team All @-@ SEC selection . 
 Auburn 's rushing offense was led by two highly regarded running backs : Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown . The two men , combined with quarterback Campbell , ran for 15 @,@ 739 yards and 129 career touchdowns prior to the Sugar Bowl . Williams led the SEC in all @-@ purpose yardage ( 137 @.@ 2 yards per game ) and average yards per punt return ( 11 @.@ 7 ) . He finished the regular season with 1 @,@ 104 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns . The touchdown mark was the most recorded by a running back in the SEC that year . For his accomplishments , Williams was named a first @-@ team All @-@ SEC pick . Despite missing most of his first two seasons due to injuries , he ranked second on Auburn 's all @-@ time rushing list with 3 @,@ 770 yards — behind only NFL and MLB star Bo Jackson . Williams also had the most rushing touchdowns in Auburn history ( 45 ) and was Auburn 's leading scorer in school history ( 276 points ) . Brown accumulated 845 rushing yards and caught 34 passes for 314 yards during the season prior to the Sugar Bowl . He finished with eight touchdowns and was named a second @-@ team All @-@ SEC pick . His 34 receptions were 10 more than he earned in his first three seasons combined . 
 Despite the attention focused on Auburn 's two star running backs , the team also boasted a capable corps of wide receivers as well . Prior to the game , Auburn receiver Ben <unk> said , " When you have your running game making big plays and the defense has to load the box ( defensive line ) to make plays and try to stop the running game , that opens up things in the passing game . " Auburn averaged more yards passing ( 241 @.@ 4 per game ) than running ( 189 @.@ 4 per game ) . 
 = = = Virginia Tech offense = = = 
 Heading into the Sugar Bowl , the Virginia Tech offense was led by quarterback Bryan Randall , who completed 149 of 268 passes ( 55 @.@ 6 percent ) for 1 @,@ 965 yards , 19 touchdowns , and seven interceptions . He also rushed for 466 yards and held Tech career records for total offense and passing yards . His 37 consecutive starts also are a school mark for a quarterback . In the preseason , Randall competed for the first @-@ string quarterback spot with Marcus Vick until the latter was suspended from Tech for a semester after a criminal conviction . In the weeks leading up to the Sugar Bowl , Randall was named the Virginia Division I Offensive Player of the Year by the Roanoke Times and was named the ACC Player of the Year . 
 Tech 's rushing offense featured two running backs who shared time on the field : Mike Imoh and Cedric Humes . During the regular season , Imoh rushed the ball 152 times for 704 yards , an average of 4 @.@ 6 yards per carry . He scored four touchdowns and set a school record for rushing yards in a game when he ran for 243 yards in Virginia Tech 's game against North Carolina . Humes was on the field slightly less than Imoh , but earned 595 yards and five touchdowns on 124 carries . Tech offensive tackle Jimmy Martin was expected to play in the game after recovering from a high ankle sprain . 
 On special teams , Tech 's Jim Davis blocked three field goals during the regular season , and teammate Darryl Tapp blocked a punt . Tech 's success on special teams was at least partially due to head coach Frank Beamer 's emphasis on that aspect of the game , a strategy known as " <unk> . " Due to Tech 's acumen on special teams , Auburn was forced to spend extra time in preparing its special teams to face Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl . 
 The Sugar Bowl was a homecoming for Tech punter Vinnie Burns , who played high school football 15 miles ( 24 km ) from the Louisiana Superdome , site of the Sugar Bowl . In addition , Burns ' father , Ronnie Burns , was a longtime Sugar Bowl committee member , and Vinnie committed to attend Virginia Tech while the Hokies were in New Orleans to play in the 2000 Sugar Bowl , that year 's national championship game .

 Before the Sugar Bowl , Auburn had the top @-@ ranked scoring defense in the country ( allowing 11 @.@ 2 points per game ) , the fifth @-@ ranked total defense ( allowing 269 @.@ 5 total yards per game ) , eighth in passing defense ( allowing 163 yards passing per game ) , and 16th in rushing defense ( allowing 106 @.@ 5 yards rushing per game ) . Cornerback Carlos Rogers was one of the key players on the defensive squad . Rogers , who won the Jim Thorpe Award — given annually to the best defensive back in the country — earned consensus All @-@ America honors and was a finalist for the Bronco Nagurski Award and a semifinalist for the Chuck Bednarik Award , each given to the best defensive college football player in the United States . 
 Linebacker Travis Williams had the most tackles on the team during the regular season , finishing with 76 . He also tied for third on the team in tackles for loss ( nine ) , had two interceptions , two sacks , and was named a second @-@ team All @-@ SEC selection . 
 Senior safety Junior Rosegreen , freshman end Stanley <unk> and junior nose guard Tommy Jackson were first @-@ team all @-@ SEC picks , signifying they were the best players at their position in the conference .

That single @-@ game performance tied the SEC record and set the Auburn record for the most interceptions in one game . Jackson finished the regular season with 49 tackles , six tackles for loss , and one sack . 
 Linebacker <unk> Williams was scheduled to miss the game after undergoing surgery to repair a dislocated bone suffered in the Tigers ' game against Georgia . Williams had 44 tackles during the regular season , and had been replaced by Derrick Graves in the SEC championship game . Graves was expected to do so again in the Sugar Bowl .

 At the conclusion of the regular season , Virginia Tech 's defense was ranked third nationally in scoring defense ( 12 @.@ 6 points allowed per game ) , fourth in total defense ( 269 @.@ 5 total yards allowed per game ) and fifth in pass defense ( 149 @.@ 8 passing yards allowed per game ) . The Tech defense featured two highly regarded cornerbacks , Jimmy Williams and Eric Green , who finished the regular season with 50 tackles and 31 tackles , respectively . Williams also had four interceptions ( the most on the team ) , including one returned for a touchdown , and was named first @-@ team All @-@ ACC . Green , meanwhile , had one interception .

 Linebacker Mikal <unk> was first on the team in tackles , recording 63 during the regular season . Fellow linebacker Vince Hall ranked second , with 62 . 
 On the defensive line , defensive tackle Jonathan Lewis was considered a key player .

 = = = First quarter = = = 
 Following the ceremonial pre @-@ game coin toss , Auburn elected to kick off to Virginia Tech to begin the game , ensuring the Tigers would have possession to begin the second half . Tech began the first drive of the game from its 20 @-@ yard line following a touchback . The Hokies initially had success moving the ball , as quarterback Bryan Randall rushed for seven yards on the game 's first play , then completed a four @-@ yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal two plays later for a first down . The Auburn defense recovered , however , and the Hokies did not gain another first down and were forced to punt . Auburn recovered the ball and began its first drive of the game from its 26 @-@ yard line . On the Tigers ' first play , quarterback Jason Campbell threw a long pass to Cooper Wallace for 35 yards . This was followed by another long play as running back Ronnie Brown ran for 31 yards . After the initial shock of the Auburn offense , the Virginia Tech defense firmed up , and Auburn 's next three plays were stopped for losses or minimal gains . Facing a fourth down at the Virginia Tech six @-@ yard line , Auburn sent in kicker John Vaughn , who kicked a 23 @-@ yard field goal for the game 's first points . With 8 : 35 remaining in the first quarter , Auburn took an early 3 – 0 lead . 
 Following the post @-@ field goal kickoff , the Virginia Tech offense attempted to answer Auburn 's quick score . Unfortunately for the Hokies , their second drive fared even worse than the first . Tech committed a 10 @-@ yard penalty , suffered an eight @-@ yard loss on a play , then had a Bryan Randall pass intercepted by Auburn safety Junior Rosegreen . Rosegreen returned the ball 31 yards , and put Auburn 's offense into good field position for its second drive of the game . Auburn also suffered an early penalty in its drive , but moved the ball with another long play — a 23 @-@ yard pass to Courtney Taylor — to recover . Again , however , the Virginia Tech defense recovered to force Auburn into a fourth down and a field goal attempt . Vaughn returned to the field and kicked a 19 @-@ yard field goal , giving Auburn a 6 – 0 lead with 1 : 06 remaining in the quarter . 
 With time in the quarter running out , Virginia Tech fielded the post @-@ score kickoff and executed a quick series of plays , gaining a first down before time ran out . At the end of the first quarter , Auburn held an early 6 – 0 lead . 
 = = = Second quarter = = = 
 Virginia Tech began the second quarter in possession of the ball and driving down the field . Bryan Randall completed a 10 @-@ yard pass for another first down , but after Tech failed to gain another , the Hokies were forced to punt . Auburn reciprocated by going three and out and punting the ball back to Virginia Tech . In its first full drive of the second quarter , the Hokies had their best drive of the first half . After a holding penalty nullified a long kickoff return , Tech began at its 24 @-@ yard line . Randall completed a nine @-@ yard pass to tight end Jeff King , then ran for another nine yards on a quarterback scramble . He followed the first @-@ down run by completing three consecutive long passes of 16 yards , 13 yards , and 31 yards , respectively . The last pass , to wide receiver Josh Hyman , drove Virginia Tech inside the Auburn two @-@ yard line . There , however , the Tech offense faltered . On three plays , Tech failed to cross the goal line , gaining only one yard in the process . Facing fourth down and needing just one yard for a touchdown , Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt to gain the touchdown , rather than send in his kicker for a field goal attempt . The attempted touchdown pass by Randall fell incomplete , and Virginia Tech turned the ball over on downs without scoring any points . 
 Auburn 's offense took over at its one @-@ yard line after Tech 's failure to score . Jason Campbell orchestrated a successful drive that took Auburn from the shadow of its own end zone , completing passes of 16 yards , 15 yards , and 37 yards in the process . Inside the Virginia Tech red zone , however , the Auburn offense again stumbled . As it had in its two previous scoring drives , Auburn was forced to send in kicker John Vaughn despite being inside the Virginia Tech 10 @-@ yard line . Vaughn 's 24 @-@ yard kick was successful , and with 1 : 50 remaining in the second quarter , Auburn extended its lead to 9 – 0 . 
 With little time remaining before halftime , Virginia Tech used a hurry @-@ up offense . Randall completed a 23 @-@ yard pass to Eddie Royal and ran for 22 yards on his own , but threw three consecutive incomplete passes to end the drive . Tech was forced to punt the ball away , and the first half came to an end . At halftime , Auburn led , 9 – 0 .

 Because Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the game , Auburn received the ball to begin the second half . The Tigers started the first drive of the second half at their 22 @-@ yard line . Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown alternated carries as Auburn gained 17 yards in their first three plays . Jason Campbell completed a pass for a five @-@ yard loss , then , on the fifth play of the drive , completed a 53 @-@ yard pass to Anthony Mix . The pass was the longest play of the game , and drove the Tigers inside the Virginia Tech red zone . Three plays later , Campbell connected with Devin <unk> on a five @-@ yard pass for the game 's first touchdown . With 10 : 39 remaining in the third quarter , Auburn had taken a 16 – 0 lead . 
 After Auburn 's kickoff , Virginia Tech started its first drive of the second half at its 20 @-@ yard line . Down by 16 points , Tech needed to score . The Hokies gained a quick first down , but a five @-@ yard penalty and a sack of Bryan Randall prevented Tech from gaining another . The Hokies were forced to punt , and Auburn took over at its 44 @-@ yard line . Despite having good field position , the Tigers went three and out . Following the punt , Virginia Tech reciprocated by also going three and out . With 3 : 47 remaining in the quarter , Auburn began an offensive drive from its 35 @-@ yard line . From the beginning of the drive , however , the Tigers had problems . The first play of Auburn 's drive was a 10 @-@ yard penalty against the Tigers . The second resulted in a one @-@ yard loss by Ronnie Brown , who attempted to rush through the middle of the defensive line . On the third play , Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams intercepted an errant pass by Jason Campbell . Though Williams was unable to advance the ball , the Hokies still took over on offense , and with 2 : 38 remaining in the quarter , had their best field position since the first half . 
 The first play of the Tech drive resulted in a 12 @-@ yard gain as Josh Hyman rushed for 12 yards and a first down on an end @-@ around . Running back Cedric Humes was stopped for a loss on the first play after Hyman 's rush , but earned 10 yards on two subsequent rushes , setting up a fourth down . Needing one yard for a first down , behind by 16 points , and with time running down in the quarter , Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt the first down play rather than kick a field goal . Humes again rushed the ball , and as time ran out in the third quarter , picked up enough ground for the first down . With one quarter of play remaining , Auburn led Virginia Tech 16 – 0 , but the Hokies had picked up a first down inside the Auburn 10 @-@ yard line to begin the fourth quarter . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 Virginia Tech began the fourth quarter in possession of the ball , and facing a first down at the Auburn 10 @-@ yard line . In three consecutive plays , however , the Hokies only picked up a total of four yards . Needing six yards to get a touchdown , Virginia Tech sent in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 23 @-@ yard field goal . Despite the short distance , Pace missed the kick . With 13 : 56 remaining in the game , Auburn still held a 16 – 0 lead . 
 Following the missed field goal , Auburn took over on offense at its six @-@ yard line — the point from which Tech had missed the kick . Ronnie Brown picked up 13 yards and a first down on three rushes . Carnell Williams then picked up three yards , and Jason Campbell threw a seven @-@ yard pass that gave Auburn another first down . A five @-@ yard penalty against Virginia Tech pushed Auburn 's offense near midfield , and Ronnie Brown returned to the field , rushing the ball four consecutive times for 16 yards and driving the Tigers into Virginia Tech territory . Facing a fourth down and one yard , Auburn elected to give the ball to Brown again . On the one @-@ yard run , however , Brown fumbled the ball , which was recovered by Virginia Tech 's Mikal <unk> with 8 : 38 remaining . 
 Virginia Tech 's offense came on to the field desperately needing to score quickly . Though the deficit was only 16 points , and could be made up with two touchdowns and two two @-@ point conversions , the limited time remaining meant the task would be difficult , even if Virginia Tech scored quickly . The Hokies began the drive with a 17 @-@ yard pass by quarterback Bryan Randall . Justin Hamilton rushed for five yards , and Randall completed a six @-@ yard pass for another first down . The Tigers helped matters by committing a 15 @-@ yard penalty , which put the Hokies inside Auburn territory . Three plays later , Randall capitalized on the opportunity by completing a 29 @-@ yard pass to Josh Morgan for a touchdown and the Hokies ' first points of the game . Tech attempted a two @-@ point conversion , but the pass attempt fell incomplete . With 6 : 57 remaining , Virginia Tech now trailed 16 – 6 . 
 After receiving the post @-@ touchdown kickoff , Auburn began to run out the clock . The Tigers failed to pick up a first down , and after going three and out , punted the ball back to Virginia Tech . The Hokies started their drive at their two @-@ yard line , and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20 @-@ yard pass , rushing for 10 yards , then completing a five @-@ yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield . On the fourth play of the drive , however , Randall was intercepted by Auburn 's Derrick Graves . The Tigers , their offense again on the field , began running out the clock again . Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn 's clock management by calling timeouts after each play , stopping the clock with each timeout . Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out , and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2 : 13 remaining . 
 After the ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback , Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20 @-@ yard line . On the first play of the drive , Bryan Randall completed an 80 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan . The score plus the extra point cut Auburn 's lead to 16 – 13 . With time in the game almost exhausted , Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have a chance to get another offensive drive . Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn 's previous drive , Auburn would be free to run out the game 's final minutes . Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last @-@ second miracle , the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick , allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16 – 13 victory . 
 = = Final statistics = = 
 Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell completed 11 of 16 passes for 189 yards , one touchdown , and one interception , and was named the game 's most valuable player . Despite his performance , he was neither the leading scorer on his team nor the overall best performer in the game . Auburn kicker John Vaughn was successful on all three of his field goal attempts and also succeeded on his sole extra point kick in the game , resulting in 10 Auburn points . On the opposite side of the ball , Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall completed 21 of his 38 passes for 299 yards , two touchdowns , and two interceptions . Virginia Tech kicker Branden Pace missed his sole field goal attempt of the game , a 23 @-@ yard kick . 
 On the ground , Auburn running back Ronnie Brown led all rushers with 68 yards on 14 carries . Second was Auburn 's Carnell Williams , who gained 61 yards on 19 carries . Bryan Randall was the Hokies ' leading rusher , accumulating 45 yards on nine carries . Tech 's two running backs , Mike Imoh and Cedric Humes , were stymied by the Auburn defense and managed just 26 yards on 12 combined carries . Virginia Tech wide receiver Josh Morgan finished the game with three receptions for 126 yards and two touchdowns , making him the game 's most prolific receiver . Auburn 's Courtney Taylor was second , with five catches for 87 yards , and Tech 's Josh Hyman was third with five catches for 71 yards . 
 For the defense , Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams was the top performer . Williams had 10 tackles , including 3 @.@ 5 tackles for loss , and one interception . Tech 's Mikal <unk> had eight tackles and one fumble recovery , making him the game 's second @-@ leading tackler . Auburn defender Derrick Graves was the most prolific tackler for the Tigers , making seven tackles and catching one interception of an errant Bryan Randall pass . Three players had one sack — two for Virginia Tech and one for Auburn .

 With the win , Auburn finished the season undefeated , with 13 wins and zero losses . Virginia Tech 's loss gave it a final record of 10 – 3 . 
 The victory gave Auburn fans hope that if Oklahoma won the 2005 BCS National Championship Game , a split national championship would result . By contract , the winner of the BCS National Championship Game is voted number one in the USA Today Coaches ' Poll . In contrast , the Associated Press poll has no such restriction . Auburn 's thin margin of victory over Tech put the prospect of split national title in doubt , though not out of reach . USC 's blowout 55 – 19 victory over Oklahoma , however , made it likely that USC would be the overwhelming choice for first place . When the final college football polls of the season were released , USC was voted number one by a large margin , though three voters in the Associated Press poll voted Auburn first . More than three years after the game , ESPN sportswriter Ted Miller rated the game second on his list of victims of the BCS system , just behind USC being left out of the championship game in 2003 . 
 The Tigers lost 18 players due to graduation , and several juniors elected to enter the 2005 NFL Draft as well . During the first round of the draft , Auburn had four players selected : Ronnie Brown , with the second overall pick , Carnell Williams ( fifth ) , Carlos Rogers ( ninth ) , and Jason Campbell ( 25th ) . Virginia Tech had three players selected in the 2005 draft : Eric Green ( 75th ) , Vincent Fuller ( 108th ) , and Jon Dunn ( 217th ) . Virginia Tech 's appearance in the Sugar Bowl helped its recruiting efforts in the state of Virginia , with eight of the state 's top recruits ( ranked by the Roanoke Times newspaper ) , pledging to attend Tech . 
 The visiting fans of Auburn and Virginia Tech injected tens of millions of dollars into the New Orleans economy , despite high food , travel , and lodging costs that forced some fans to cut discretionary spending during their trips .

 = Birket Israel = 
 Birket Israel ( trans . Pool of Israel ) also Birket <unk> or Birket Isra 'in , abbreviated from Birket <unk> Beni <unk> ( trans . Pool of the Tribes of the Children of Israel ) was a public cistern located on the north @-@ eastern corner of the Temple Mount , in Jerusalem . The structure is believed to have been built by the Romans for use as a water reservoir and also to protect the northern wall of the Temple Mount . Arab locals have known it by this name since at least 1857 . 
 By the mid @-@ 19th century it had gone out of use as a reservoir ; being partly filled with rubbish and reused as a vegetable garden . In 1934 it was filled in and is now known as el @-@ Ghazali Square . It is currently in mixed use for shops , as a car park , and as a transshipment point for refuse . 
 = = Construction = = 
 According to Muslim tradition , the reservoir was constructed by Ezekiel or Hezekiah , King of Judah . Some archaeologists have determined that the cistern was possibly built during the Herodian period to improve Jerusalem 's water supply . Others estimate the date of construction later , in around 130 CE . This view is held by Charles Warren who recorded that although some kind of fosse must have existed at the spot at a very early period , since there is no description of the pool in the works of Josephus , " and it is very improbable that he world have omitted to mention so enormous a reservoir had it existed in his time " , it was most probably constructed by Roman emperor Hadrian during his restoration of Jerusalem . This is further attested to since the masonry of the <unk> is inferior in character and resembles the later Roman work in Syria . Additionally , this reservoir appears to be mentioned by the Bordeaux Pilgrim ( section 4 ) as already existing , and " would therefore most naturally be referable to Hadrian . " 
 It was constructed in the bed of the western fork of the Kidron Valley that traverses the north @-@ west quarter of the city . It formed Jerusalem 's largest reservoir , measuring 109 @.@ 7 m ( 360 ft ) by 38 @.@ 4 m ( 126 ft ) with a maximum depth of 26 m ( 85 ft ) . The cistern contained a total capacity of 120 @,@ 000 cubic meters and for centuries it formed part of Jerusalem 's rainwater storage system . The pool also served as a moat , protecting the northern wall of the Temple Mount . 
 The eastern and western ends of the pool were partially rock @-@ cut and partly masonry . The masonry at the eastern end formed a great dam 13 @.@ 7 m ( 45 ft ) thick , the lower part of which was continuous with an ancient eastern wall of the Temple compound . The sides of the pool were lined entirely with masonry because it was built across the width of a valley . The original bottom of the reservoir was covered with a layer of about 19 inches of very hard Roman concrete and cement . There was a great conduit at the eastern end of the pool built of massive stones , and connected with the pool by a perforated stone with three round holes 5 ½ inches in diameter . The position of this outlet shows that all water over a depth of 6 @.@ 5 m ( 21 ft ) must have flowed away . 
 = = Association with the Pool of Bethesda = = 
 The Birket Israel cistern was frequented by Christian pilgrims during the 19th century , it being previously identified as the " Sheep Pool " or Pool of Bethesda of John 5 : 2 ; a double @-@ pool with five porches , where the sick came to be cured . This link was based on the premise that the nearby St. Stephen 's Gate occupied the site of the Sheep Gate mentioned in the New Testament . It was reinforced by the co @-@ location of the names ' Birket Israel ' and the ' Pool of Bethesda ' on maps and plans of Jerusalem ; and in drawings and paintings , such as those made by David Roberts in 1893 . 
 According to Kopp , the Pool of Bethesda became associated with a Byzantine church by 450 CE ; then a 6th @-@ century church , which by the arrival of the Crusaders , in 1099 , was known as the " Church of St. Anne " . A new Church of St. Anne was built in the 12th century CE ; the church and the pool fell into disuse after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem . The church was converted into madrasah and Christian pilgrims were redirected to nearby Birket Israel on the other side of what is now called the " Via Dolorosa " . Ownership of the whole site of the Church of St. Anne passed to France after the Crimean War , in 1856 ; and discoveries made in around 1870 led to the belief that the real Pool of Bethesda was actually located in the grounds of the Church of St. Anne . 
 = = Later uses = = 
 By the mid @-@ 19th century , Birket Israel was no longer being used as a reservoir ; and towards the end of the 19th century it was being rapidly filled with refuse and part of it was being used as a vegetable garden . In 1934 the pool was filled in because its condition posed a threat to public health . 
 Being located just inside the Lions ' Gate , one of the major entries to the Old City , the East Jerusalem Development Company initially intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi @-@ storey car park at the site . This post @-@ 1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work at the base of the Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound . Subsequently , in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool . 
 Today the area is known as el @-@ Ghazali Square and is used as a car park and collection point for refuse before it is dumped outside the city . Some small shops also exist at the site . 
 = Capture of Grenada ( 1779 ) = 
 During the Anglo @-@ French War , the Capture of Grenada was an amphibious expedition in July 1779 . Charles Hector , comte D 'Estaing led French forces against the British @-@ held West Indies island of Grenada . Having landed on July 2 , the assault occurred on the night of July 3 @-@ 4 . The French forces assaulted the British fortifications on Hospital Hill , overlooking the island capital Saint George 's . They captured cannons and turned them against Fort George . Governor Lord Macartney opened negotiations to surrender . 
 Admiral d 'Estaing controversially rejected Macartney 's terms of capitulation , insisting on adopting the harsh terms he had written . Macartney rejected those terms , choosing instead to surrender unconditionally . D 'Estaing thereafter permitted his forces to loot the town , and Macartney was sent to France as a prisoner of war . 
 On July 5 , French forces were reembarked on the fleet when word arrived that a British fleet under Admiral John Byron was approaching . The two fleets battled the next day . The French severely damaged several British ships . Both fleets , however , returned to their bases . Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris , France returned Grenada to British control at the end of the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the entry of France into the American War of Independence as an American ally in early 1778 , French Admiral the comte D 'Estaing arrived in the West Indies in early December 1778 in command of a fleet consisting of 12 ships of the line and a number of smaller vessels . At about the same time a British fleet under Admiral William Hotham also arrived , augmenting the West Indies fleet of Admiral Samuel Barrington . The British then captured French @-@ held St. Lucia , despite d 'Estaing 's attempt at relief . The British used St. Lucia to monitor the French on Martinique , where d 'Estaing was based . 
 The British fleet was further reinforced in January 1779 by ten ships of the line under Admiral John Byron , who assumed command of the British Leeward Islands station . Throughout the first half of 1779 both fleets received further reinforcements , after which the French fleet was superior to that of the British . Furthermore , Byron departed St. Lucia on 6 June in order to provide escort services to British merchant ships gathering at St. Kitts for a convoy to Europe , leaving d 'Estaing free to act . D 'Estaing and the French governor @-@ general at Martinique , the marquis de Bouillé , seized the opportunity to begin a series of operations against nearby British possessions . 
 Their first target , the isle of Saint Vincent , fell on 18 June , and d 'Estaing turned his attention to other islands . He had hoped to capture Barbados , a key British possession , but after making no progress against the prevailing easterly trade winds , he turned his attention instead to Grenada . 
 = = British defences = = 
 Grenada was at the time one of Britain 's richest colonies , producing significant quantities of sugar on its plantations . Lord Macartney , the British governor , had been alerted to the possibility of a French attack . He made repeated requests for support to Admiral Byron and the British commander at St. Kitts , but was told that Saint Vincent was the principal French interest , and that Byron would bring relief should Grenada be attacked . 
 Macartney had at his disposal 101 soldiers drawn from the 48th Regiment of Foot and 24 artillery men . He also had over 400 militia and volunteers , but he did not consider these forces dependable , especially since one third of them were of French extraction . He ordered the construction of significant fortifications on Hospital Hill , a prominence overlooking the island capital St. George 's . The steep hillsides were fortified by stone walls , and the hilltop had a palisade surrounding a series of entrenchments . 
 = = French capture = = 
 The French fleet anchored off the Grenada coast just north of St. George 's on 2 July . The troops that d 'Estaing landed that day consisted of the 1 @,@ 400 man Irish Dillon Regiment and 700 troops drawn from the regiments Champagne , Foix , <unk> , and Hainault . With the arrival of the French , Macartney ordered his forces to withdraw behind the fortifications of Hospital Hill . D 'Estaing spent 3 July reconnoitering the British position . Concerned that Byron might appear at any time , he decided to launch an attack on Hospital Hill . He first sent a parley flag to Macartney demanding his surrender ; the British governor rejected the demand . 
 D 'Estaing 's plan of attack called for three columns to attack the back side of the fortifications with bayonets , while a small fourth detachment made a demonstration from a location where the British might more reasonably expect an attack . On the evening of 3 July these formations moved out . The columns , each numbering 300 men , were led by Arthur Dillon , his brother Édouard , and the comte de Noailles . Arthur Dillon 's column was also accompanied by an advance guard of 180 under the comte de <unk> , and the demonstration force numbered just 200 . At 4 : 00 am on the 4th the demonstration force opened fire , while the three columns charged up Hospital Hill . The British defenders panicked , and most of them fled down the hill to the apparent safety of Fort George . 
 The British , in their haste to leave the premises , neglected to spike some of the cannons ( by driving a metal spike into the <unk> , rendering the cannon inoperative ) . They also abandoned many valuables that had been brought up on the heights for safekeeping . The French used the captured cannons to fire upon Fort George . Realising the situation was hopeless , Macartney raised the white flag . The French took about 700 prisoners , and claimed casualties of 36 killed and 71 wounded . British reports , however , claimed the French casualties numbered closer to 300 . The French also claimed as prizes 30 merchant ships anchored in the harbour . 
 Admiral d 'Estaing rejected Macartney 's proposed terms of capitulations , countering with a list of articles that he had drafted . Macartney found d 'Estaing 's proposed articles " not merely unprecedented and humiliating , but so ensnaring and uncertain in their nature , extent , and aim that they might at any time supply a pretext for taking away the lives , together with the fortunes , of the <unk> . " His council was unanimous in rejecting the proposed capitulation , and the British chose to surrender unconditionally instead . As a consequence , d 'Estaing permitted his troops to pillage St. George 's . Among the items taken or destroyed were most of Macartney 's silver and plate , much of his clothing , and his personal papers . ( The latter came as a particularly harsh blow to the governor , for copies of those papers sent to St. Lucia with his wife for safeguarding were destroyed by fire . ) When d 'Estaing invited Macartney to dine with him , the governor apologised for his garb , noting that the coat he was wearing was the only one left him . Macartney and other leading Grenadians were also refused parole , and were sent to France as prisoners of war . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Admiral Byron had been alerted to the capture of Saint Vincent on 1 July , and was en route with a force to retake it when he learnt of the attack on Grenada . He immediately sailed there , arriving on the morning of 6 July . D 'Estaing , alerted to Byron 's intentions on the 5th , embarked most of the troops and weighed anchor at 4 : 00 am on the 6th . The fleets battled off Grenada , with d 'Estaing prevailing over Byron 's disorganized attack . There were no further major actions in the West Indies before d 'Estaing sailed north and led an unsuccessful siege of British @-@ held Savannah , Georgia in September . 
 D 'Estaing 's successes in capturing Grenada and defeating Byron made him immensely popular in France . Playwright and actor Pierre @-@ Germain <unk> wrote Veni , Vidi , Vici , ou La <unk> de Grenade containing a reenactment of the capture . D 'Estaing did not see the popular work , but John Paul Jones attended a performance during a visit to Paris . 
 During their occupation , the French began construction of a series of fortifications on Richmond Hill . Designed to defend against an attack like theirs , its cannons pointed to the landward rather than seaward side . These defences were completed by the British after 1783 . 
 Both Grenada and Saint Vincent remained in French hands until the end of the war , when they were returned to Britain under the terms of the 1783 Treaty of Paris . The rule of the comte de <unk> , who was appointed governor by d 'Estaing , was reported by British residents to be harsh and oppressive . After the British resumed control , they cracked down on the predominantly Roman Catholic French @-@ speaking population , leading to discontent and an exodus of French Grenadians to Trinidad . These religious and cultural divisions in Grenadian society contributed to the rise of local resistance which culminated in the nearly @-@ successful <unk> Rebellion in 1795 – 96 .

 = Hurva Synagogue = 
 The Hurva Synagogue , ( Hebrew : בית <unk> <unk> , translit : Beit ha @-@ Knesset ha @-@ Hurva , lit . " The Ruin Synagogue " ) , also known as <unk> Rabbi Yehudah he @-@ Hasid ( " Ruin of Rabbi Judah the Pious " ) , is a historic synagogue located in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem . 
 The synagogue was founded in the early 18th century by followers of Judah heHasid , but it was destroyed by Muslims a few years later in 1721 . The plot lay in ruins for over 140 years and became known as the Ruin , or Hurva . In 1864 , the Perushim rebuilt the synagogue , and although officially named the Beis Yaakov Synagogue , it retained its name as the Hurva . It became Jerusalem 's main Ashkenazic synagogue , until it too was deliberately destroyed by the Arab Legion after the withdrawal of Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab – Israeli War . 
 After Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 , a number of plans were submitted for the design of a new building . After years of deliberation and indecision , a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977 , itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter . The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th @-@ century style received approval by the Israeli Government in 2000 , and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15 , 2010 . 
 = = Early history = = 
 The Hurva Synagogue today stands off a plaza in the centre of Jerusalem 's Jewish Quarter . Excavations carried out at the site in July and August 2003 revealed evidence from four main settlement periods : First Temple ( 800 – 600 BCE ) , Second Temple ( 100 CE ) , Byzantine and Ottoman . Three bedrock @-@ hewn <unk> ( ritual baths ) were uncovered there dating from the 1st century . The earliest tradition regarding the site is of a synagogue existing there at the time of the second @-@ century sage Judah the Prince . By the 13th century , the area had become a courtyard , known as Der Ashkenaz ( the Ashkenazic Compound ) , for the Ashkenazic community of Jerusalem . In 1488 , Obadiah ben Abraham <unk> described a large courtyard containing many houses for exclusive use of the Ashkenazim , adjacent to a " synagogue built on pillars , " referring to the Ramban Synagogue . The Ramban Synagogue had been used jointly by both Ashkenazim and Sephardim until 1586 , when the Ottoman authorities confiscated the building . Thereafter , the Ashkenazim established a synagogue within their own , adjacent courtyard . 
 = = Judah heHasid and aftermath : 1700s = = 
 In the winter of 1700 , a group of around 500 Ashkenazim led by Judah heHasid arrived from Europe . They were mystics who were intent on advancing the arrival of the Messianic Era by settling in Jerusalem and leading ascetic lives . A few days after their arrival in the city , heHasid died , and without a leader , their messianic hopes dissipated and the community began to disintegrate . Those who remained managed to build forty dwellings and a small synagogue in the Ashkenazic Compound . Soon after , they endeavoured to construct a larger synagogue , but the task proved expensive . They found themselves having to bribe the Ottoman authorities in order to enable them to proceed with their building project . Unexpected costs relating to the construction , financial hardships and the burden of various other taxes drained their funds . They became impoverished and were forced to take loans from local Arabs , eventually falling into severe debt . Pressure and threats from the creditors led to a <unk> ( rabbinical emissary ) being sent to abroad to solicit funds for repayment of the loans . In late 1720 , with the debts still outstanding , the Arab lenders lost patience and set the synagogue and its contents alight . The leaders of the community were imprisoned and shortly after , all the Ashkenazim were banished from the city . Over the course of time , shops were built in the courtyard and the synagogue was left desolate , in a pile of rubble . It thus became known as the " Ruin of Rabbi Judah heHasid " . 
 = = Efforts of the Perushim : 1812 – 37 = = 
 Between 1808 and 1812 another group of ascetic Jews , known as Perushim , immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania . They were disciples of the Vilna Gaon and had settled in the city of Safed to the north . Some had wished to settle in Jerusalem and reclaim the Ashkenazic Compound . They were worried , however , that descendants of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century @-@ old debts incurred by he @-@ Hasid 's followers and that a new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment . The descendants of a group of Hasidim who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a problem . They apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim to take control of the synagogue ruin , claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors . The Hasidim claimed they had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the parcel of land were greater . 
 Nevertheless , in late 1815 , leader of the Safed Perushim , Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Shklov , arrived in Jerusalem with a group of followers . They directed their main efforts to rebuilding he @-@ Hasid 's synagogue , which had symbolised the expulsion of the Ashkenazim from Jerusalem . By this , they intended to demonstrate the re @-@ establishment of Ashkenazic presence in the city . Rebuilding one of Jerusalem 's ruins would also have symbolic kabbalistic significance . The " repairing " of an earlier destruction would represent the first step of rebuilding the entire city , a prerequisite for the arrival of the Messiah . 
 In 1816 they " pleaded with the powers in the city of Constantinople to obtain a royal decree that the Arabs residing in Jerusalem would not be permitted to enforce the debts of the Ashkenazim " , but nothing came of it . A year later , several leaders of the group , including Avraham Shlomo Zalman Zoref and Solomon <unk> , travelled to Constantinople endeavouring to obtain such a firman ( imperial decree ) . Two years later , in 1819 , their efforts were realised and the century @-@ old debts were cancelled . The group acquired a legal document delineating the entire site acquired by he @-@ Hasid in 1700 . The area now included dilapidated dwellings and shops built by the creditors ' heirs on part of the site . Next , they had to secure another firman that would permit construction at the site , including the building of a large synagogue . Two successive missions in 1820 and 1821 to obtain the firman from the sultan 's court failed . 
 Still awaiting imperial permission to build in the courtyard , the Perushim wished to rely on an old firman given to the Jews in 1623 , which stated that there could be no objection to them building in their own quarters . Having received a supporting document issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824 , it was possible for them begin rebuilding the dwellings in the courtyard . In practice , however , construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land . This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government 's disregard of the documents proving their ownership of the courtyard . 
 In 1825 , following the disruption the group were experiencing , Shapira travelled to Europe once again . He hoped to secure the necessary firman , which would place the courtyard firmly in the Perushim 's possession , and also to raise funds to cover the costs incurred trying to redeem the courtyard . His mission , however , was unsuccessful , as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Shlomo Zalman Zoref , a Lithuanian @-@ born silversmith . 
 = = = Egypt gives building consent = = = 
 With the annexation of Jerusalem by Egypt in 1831 , a new opportunity arose for the Perushim . They petitioned Muhammad Ali regarding the rebuilding of the synagogue , but concerns about deviating from longstanding Muslim tradition and the Pact of Umar ( which restricted the repair or construction of non @-@ Muslim houses of worship ) meant permission was not forthcoming . However , five months after the earthquake of May 1834 , the prohibition was relaxed and the Sephardim were allowed to carry out repair works to their existing synagogues . This consent gave rise to further efforts by the Ashkenazim to receive authorisation to rebuild theirs . 
 On 23 June 1836 , after traveling to Egypt , Zoref , together with the backing of the Austrian and Russian consuls in Alexandria , obtained the long @-@ awaited firman . It seems he was successful in gaining support of the Austrian consul and Muhammad Ali by invoking the name of Baron Salomon Mayer von Rothschild of Vienna . Muhammad Ali was hopeful that by giving his permission to rebuild the Ruin , Rothschild would be inclined to forge financial and political ties with him , which would in turn secure political support of Austria and France . In fact , Rothschild 's involvement was a ruse . As soon as Zoref received the firman , he contacted Zvi Hirsch <unk> of the Clerks ' Organisation in Amsterdam , requesting that funds his brother had pledged towards the building of synagogues in Palestine be applied to the Ruin . But <unk> had doubts as to what exactly the firman permitted . Explicit authorisation for construction of a large synagogue was absent . ( A letter from the leaders of the Amsterdam community to Moses Montefiore in 1849 confirms that permission for a synagogue in the <unk> Compound had not been sanctioned ; they had only been allowed to build dwellings in the area . ) 
 = = = Menachem Zion Synagogue = = = 
 In spite of the doubts highlighted in relation to the construction of a synagogue , the Perushim , confidently in possession of the ambiguous firman , began clearing away the rubble from the Ruin courtyard in September 1836 . As the foundations of he @-@ Hasid 's original synagogue were revealed , they discovered a few old documents dating from 1579 , signed by Israel ben Moses <unk> . After much debate , they decided not to rebuild the Ruin , but initially erect a small structure on the edge of the <unk> compound . The Arab creditors , however , still refused to relinquish the claims they had on the Jews and continued to interfere with the works . Zoref , claiming that the Ashkenazim currently in Jerusalem were not related in any way to those who had borrowed the money at the turn of the 18th century , was forced to appear in court requesting a further ruling cancelling the debts . He mentioned that an injunction had already been passed that absolved the Ashkenazim from repaying the debt and maintained that the Turkish Statute of Limitations cancelled out the debts of Judah heHasid 's followers . Although the court ruled in the Ashkenazim 's favour , Zoref nevertheless had to appease the Arab instigators with annual bribes in order to allow building to continue . At some point this arrangement ceased and in 1851 , he was struck on the head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later . By January 1837 however , the Perushim had dedicated the modest Menachem Zion Synagogue in the northwestern corner of the courtyard . In 1854 , a second smaller synagogue was built within the compound . The actual plot upon which he @-@ Hasid 's synagogue had stood 130 years earlier , however , remained in ruins . 
 = = Rebuilding he @-@ Hasid 's Ruin : 1857 – 64 = = 
 In the early 1850s , the Perushim felt ready to attempt the building a larger synagogue on he @-@ Hasid 's original site . An outcome of the Crimean War was the British Government 's willingness to use its increased influence at Constantinople to intervene on behalf of its Jewish subjects who resided in Jerusalem . On 13 July 1854 , James Finn of the British consulate in Jerusalem wrote to the British ambassador in Constantinople describing the wishes of the 2 @,@ 000 strong Ashkenazic community to build a new synagogue . He noted that funds for construction had been collected by Moses Montefiore twelve years earlier . He also enclosed a 150 @-@ year @-@ old firman , which authorised the Ashkenazic Jews to rebuild their ruined synagogue . As the title to the plot of land was held by the <unk> family , who were British subjects , they designated London @-@ born Rabbi <unk> , son of Chief Rabbi of Great Britain Solomon <unk> , to negotiate the transfer . The British consulate agreed to lend its sanction to the contract in order to avoid possible intrusion by the Turks . At issue was the question of whether the building of a synagogue at the site constituted the repair of an old house of non @-@ Muslim worship or the establishment of a new synagogue . The Turks would have to grant a special license for the latter . This was received through the efforts of Francis Napier and Stratford Canning , 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe , British ambassadors to the Sublime Porte , who secured the necessary firman in 1854 . In July 1855 , while in Constantinople , Montefiore was handed the firman , which he hand @-@ delivered during his fourth visit to Jerusalem in 1857 . 
 With permission granted , the groundbreaking ceremony took place on the last day of Hanukkah of 1855 . On April 22 , 1856 , the cornerstone was laid in the presence of Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem , Shmuel Salant . Salant had been instrumental in raising the necessary funding , making a trip to Europe in 1860 and obtaining large donations , especially from Montefiore . Some of the stones used in construction of the building was purchased from the Industrial Plantation , where poor Jews assisted in quarrying and shaping the blocks . On May 7 , 1856 Consul Finn inspected the site after receiving complaints from Muslims who suspected the opening of windows towards a mosque . 
 Although originally in possession of a lump sum they hoped would pay for the planned edifice , expenses increased . Construction work progressed slowly for lack of funds and the impoverished community soon found themselves having to arrange collections throughout the diaspora . One notable emissary , Jacob Saphir , set off for Egypt in 1857 and returned in 1863 having visited Yemen , Aden , India , Java , Australia , New Zealand and Ceylon . The largest single gift came from Ezekiel Reuben , a wealthy Sephardi Jew from Baghdad , who gave 100 @,@ 000 of the million piasters needed . His sons , <unk> and Sasson , later supplemented his donation . The combined donations from the Reuben family eventually covered more than half the cost . It marked an important step in the unity of the Sephardic and Ashkenazic communities of the city . Another contributor was Frederick William IV of Prussia , whose name was inscribed above the entrance together with those of other benefactors . He also gave permission for funds to be collected from his Jewish subjects . Throughout Western Europe , emissaries sought donations with the slogan " Merit Eternal Life with one stone " . 
 With new funds arriving , work could progress . In 1862 the domed ceiling was completed and Rabbi <unk> <unk> , head of the Ashkenazic community , was honored with placing the final stone of the dome . Two years later in 1864 , the new synagogue was dedicated . Present was Baron Alphonse James de Rothschild , who 8 years earlier had been given the honour of laying the first stone . The edifice was officially named Beis Yaakov – " House of Jacob " – in memory of James Mayer de Rothschild , whose son Edmond James de Rothschild had dedicated much of his life supporting the Jews of Palestine . The locals , however , continued to refer to the building as the Hurva . As a token of gratitude to the British government for their involvement , the British Consul James Finn , was invited to the dedication ceremony , which included a thanksgiving service . He described the " beautiful chants and anthems in Hebrew " , the subsequent refreshments provided and the playing of Russian and Austrian music . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 The Hurva Synagogue was designed and constructed under the supervision of Assad Effendi , the sultan 's official architect . Built in Byzantine Revival style , it was supported by four massive pilasters at each corner over which soared a large dome . The construction of only one of these towers was completed . The other three were missing the upper level and the small dome that capped it . The facade was covered in finely hewn stone and incorporated 12 @.@ 5 m ( 41 ft ) high window arches . The height of the synagogue to the bottom of its dome was around 16 m ( 52 ft ) and to the top of the dome it was 24 m ( 79 ft ) . Twelve windows were placed around the base of the dome , which was surrounded by a veranda , which offered a fine view of large parts of the Old City and the area around Jerusalem . Being one of the tallest structures in the Old City , it was visible for miles . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The synagogue prayer hall was reached via an entrance with three iron gates . The length was around 15 @.@ 5 m ( 51 ft ) and the width was around 14 m ( 46 ft ) . The women 's section was in the galleries , along the three sides of the chapel , except the eastern side . Access to the galleries was through towers situated at the corners of the building . 
 The Torah ark had the capacity to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built on two levels . It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds . The Ark , together with its ornamental gates , were taken from the <unk> Synagogue in Kherson , Russia , which had been used by Russian Jewish conscripts forced to spend twenty @-@ five years in the Imperial Russian Army . Directly above the Ark was a triangular window with rounded points . To the right and in front of the ark was the cantor 's podium , which was designed as a miniature version of the two @-@ level Ark . 
 The centre of the synagogue originally contained a high wooden <unk> , but this was later replaced with a flat platform covered with expensive marble plates . 
 Numerous crystal chandeliers hung from the dome . The dome itself was painted sky @-@ blue and strewn with golden stars . Frescoes with religious motifs , such as stars of David , the menorah , Mount Sinai and the Ten Commandments , adorned every wall . In the four corners were drawings of four animals in accordance with the statement in <unk> Avot : " Be strong as the leopard and swift as the eagle , fleet as the deer and brave as the lion to do the will of your Father in Heaven . " 
 One of the most generous donations came from Pinchas Rosenberg , the Imperial Court tailor of Saint Petersburg . In the diary of Rabbi Chaim ha @-@ Levy , the emissary who had been sent from Jerusalem to collect funds for the synagogue , Rosenberg set out in details what his money was intended for . Among the items that were bought with his money were two big bronze <unk> ; a silver menorah that " arrived miraculously on the 1st <unk> [ 1866 ] precisely in time to light the last eight Hanukah candles " and an iron door made under the holy ark for safe @-@ keeping of the candlestick . He also earmarked funds towards the building of an " artistically wrought iron fence around the roof under the upper windows so that there be a veranda on which may stand all our brethren who go up in pilgrimage to behold our desolate Temple , and also a partition for the womenfolk on the Feast of <unk> and <unk> Torah . "

 From 1864 onwards , the Hurva Synagogue was considered the most beautiful and most important synagogue in the Land of Israel . It was described as " the glory of the Old City " and the " most striking edifice in all of Palestine . " It also housed part of the Etz Chaim Yeshiva , the largest yeshiva in Jerusalem . It was a focal point of Jewish spiritual life in the city and was the site of the installation of the Ashkenazic chief rabbis of both Palestine and Jerusalem . On his visit to Jerusalem in 1866 , Moses Montefiore went to the synagogue , placing a silver breastplate on one of the Torah scrolls . When he visited again in 1875 , a crowd of 3 @,@ 000 Jews turned out to greet him . On February 3 , 1901 a memorial service for Queen Victoria took place inside the synagogue in gratitude for the protection afforded to the Jews of Jerusalem by Britain . The service was presided over by the Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi , Shmuel Salant . According to a report in The Jewish Chronicle , the large building was " filled to its utmost capacity and policemen had to keep off the crowds , who vainly sought admission , by force " . In around 1919 , Benjamin Lee Gordon wrote that the " synagogue presented a very pleasant and dignified appearance . It was well illuminated with artistic lamps presented by a certain Mr. Lichtenstein , of Philadelphia . " In 1921 Abraham Isaac Kook was appointed first Chief Rabbi of Palestine at the synagogue . The synagogue also hosted Herbert Samuel , 1st Viscount Samuel , who was honoured with reciting a portion of the Torah . In 1923 Yosef Shalom Eliashiv 's bar mitzvah was held at the synagogue . In the 1930s and possibly earlier , the Synagogue housed the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where indigent students form the Old City received their Torah education . 
 = = Destruction during the 1948 Arab – Israeli War = = 
 On May 25 , 1948 , during the battle for the Old City , commander of the Jordanian Arab Legion , Major Abdullah el @-@ Tell , wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard , he would be forced to attack it . Moshe <unk> , commander of the Haganah in the Old City , ignored his request , knowing that if the Hurva fell , the battle for the Jewish Quarter would soon be lost . On May 26 , 1948 , the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours ; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded . 
 On May 27 , el @-@ Tell , after receiving no answer to his proposition , told his men to " Get the Hurva Synagogue by noon . " Fawzi el @-@ Kutub executed the mission by placing a 200 @-@ litre barrel filled with explosives against the synagogue wall . The explosion resulted in a gaping hole and Haganah fighters spent forty @-@ five minutes fighting in vain to prevent the Legionnaires from entering . When they finally burst through , they tried to reach the top of its dome to plant an Arab flag . Three were shot by snipers , but the fourth succeeded . The Arab flag flying over the Old City skyline signaled the Legion 's triumph . As the Legionnaires took the " Hurva ” Synagogue , the quarter ’ s most sacred building , they blew it up without reason A huge explosion reduced the 84 @-@ year @-@ old synagogue , together with the Etz Chaim Yeshiva attached to it , to rubble . 
 The building was deliberately mined after the Arabs had captured the area . Together with that major synagogue , another 57 Jewish sanctuaries were purposely and systematically destroyed by the Jordanians soon after their occupation of the Old City in 1948 . 
 = = Post @-@ 1967 : Plans sought for a new design = = 
 Following the Six @-@ Day War , plans were mooted and designs sought for a new synagogue to be built at the site , part of the overall rehabilitation of the Jewish Quarter . Many religious and political figures supported the proposal to rebuild the original synagogue " where it was , as it was " in line with the traditional religious character of the area . However , the Jewish Quarter Development Company , in charge of the restoration of the Jewish Quarter , strongly opposed it . The Israeli planners and architects involved in developing the area wanted the building to reflect their modern Western identity . Additionally , although it would have been possible to rebuild it as it was , neither the architects nor the masons felt they were sufficiently qualified in traditional masonry technology to attempt it . Moreover , most of the original carved stones and surviving decorative elements had been removed , making a true " reconstruction " unrealisable . Swayed by the creativity of contemporary architecture and contrary to the 19th century design , which was meant to blend in with the Oriental landscape , they supported the modern redesign of the Hurva by a prominent architect . 
 = = = Kahn plans = = = 
 Leading the campaign to rebuild the Hurva was Shlomo Zalman <unk> 's great @-@ great @-@ grandson , Ya <unk> Salomon . He consulted Ram <unk> , who in turn recommended Louis Kahn , a world @-@ renowned architect who was also a founding member of the Jerusalem Committee . Kahn had also previously designed Philadelphia 's Mikveh Israel Synagogue in 1961 which remained unbuilt . Between 1968 and 1973 , Kahn presented three plans for the reconstruction . The ruins were incorporated in a memorial garden , with a new structure on an adjacent lot and a promenade , the " Route of the Prophets " , leading to the Western Wall . Kahn proposed a structure within a structure , monumental " pylons of Jerusalem stone on each side enclosing four huge central pillars of reinforced concrete , so that the pylons function [ ed ] as a container and the pillars as its content " . Following the Beaux @-@ Arts tradition , the elements of architecture were conceived as hollow , thus creating pocketing spaces within both structures . The outer structure was composed of 16 piers covered in golden Jerusalem stone cut in blocks of the same proportions and same course finish as those of the Western Wall . In the bases of the four corners of the two @-@ story , 12 m ( 39 ft ) high structure delineated by the piers , there would be small alcoves for meditation or individual prayer . Such alcoves would be used for daily prayer services , allowing larger crowds on Sabbath or festivals . Boston @-@ based architect Moshe Safdie , who had built extensively in Jerusalem and trained with Kahn in Philadelphia , was also in favour of rebuilding using contemporary design : " It 's absurd to reconstruct the Hurva as if nothing had happened . If we have the desire to rebuild it , let 's have the courage to have a great architect do it . " 
 When Teddy Kollek , then mayor of Jerusalem , had learned of Kahn 's plans to design the Hurva at a scale comparable to the Dome of the Rock and the Kotel , the mayor was unsupportive and stated : " Should we in the Jewish Quarter have a building of major importance which ' competes ' with the Mosque and the Holy Sepulcher and should we in general have any building which would compete in importance with the Western Wall of the Temple ? " Kollek was also concerned with the impact such a monumental temple may have in the Old City . Kahn 's model was displayed in the Israel Museum , but his plan was shelved when he died in 1974 . Kent Larson later referred to Kahn 's proposal as " the greatest of the unbuilt " . 
 = = Commemorative arch , subsequent proposals , and arch interpretation = = 
 As no permanent solution could be agreed upon , a temporary , symbolic solution was created . In 1977 , one of the four stone arches that had originally supported the synagogue 's monumental dome was recreated . The height of the original building , including the dome , had been 50 % greater than that of the new commemorative arch , which stood 16 m ( 52 ft ) high . Together with the remains of the building and explanatory plaques , it was a stark reminder of what had once stood at the site . 
 With the ongoing disputes over the modern façade of the proposed new building , which some felt did not properly match the Jewish Quarter 's aesthetic , an Englishman named Charles Clore took the initiative to fund a new design projects . He commissioned Denys Lasdun , who drew up plans between 1978 and 1981 that more closely adhered to the original Hurva . His plans were still considered insufficient , as they were rejected by Prime Minister Menachem Begin and the Minister of Interior , who refused to sign papers enabling construction to begin . No further progress was made and when Clore , who had wished to see the synagogue completed in his lifetime , died , his daughter provided funds to create one of the few open spaces in the Jewish Quarter adjacent to the Hurva . 
 The Hurva featured on a NIS 3 @.@ 60 Israeli postage stamp in 1993 to commemorate 45 years of Israeli independence , and its arch on a $ 1 @.@ 20 Antiguan postage stamp in 1996 . However , in 1996 , the supposedly temporary arch of the Hurva was almost thirty years old and , as a solution , it became nearly perpetual . Such condition was then publicly noted and interpreted : 
 Quite far from Kahn 's " American dream " , Israeli reality has provided [ ... ] an [ ... ] objectionable substitute — a single reconstructed arch of the Old Hurva . Such a lonely architectural sign , standing as an insipid memorial to a nineteenth @-@ century synagogue in ruins , cannot be other than a problematic reincarnation of a ruined synagogue . 
 This suggested that the single reconstructed arch of the Hurva could no longer be understood as a satisfactory expression of any commitment to rebuild the lost synagogue nor as an acceptable official response to its intentional destruction in 1948 . 
 = = Reconstruction = = 
 The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its original 19th @-@ century style received approval by the Israeli government in 2000 . Jerusalem architect Nahum Meltzer , who proposed rebuilding the synagogue in its original Ottoman format , was given the commission . Meltzer stated that " both out of respect for the historical memory of the Jewish people and out of respect for the built @-@ up area of the Old City , it is fitting for us to restore the lost glory and rebuild the Hurva Synagogue the way it was . " The state @-@ funded Jewish Quarter Development Corporation under the leadership of Dov <unk> convinced the Israeli government to allocate $ 6 @.@ 2 million ( NIS 24m ) , about 85 % of the cost , for the reconstruction , with private donors contributing the remainder . In the end , the government only gave NIS 11m , with the remainder being donated by a Ukrainian Jewish businessman and philanthropist , Vadim Rabinovitch . 
 In 2002 the Israeli mint issued a set of medals featuring the synagogue to mark the beginning of the reconstruction project . Following comprehensive historic research , the reconstruction works began in 2005 and on February 15 , 2007 , Abraham Isaac Kook of Rehovot was appointed as its rabbi , a move confirmed by leading rabbis , including Yosef Shalom Eliashiv . On April 15 , 2008 a celebration marked the placing of the keystone in the synagogue 's dome . 
 Recently , contention arose over what kind of institution the Hurva would be . <unk> and nationalist @-@ religious activists opposed the notion of another synagogue in the Old City and wanted the site to become a museum presenting the historical saga of the Jewish Quarter and displaying archaeological finds unearthed there . They viewed the appointment of Kook as the rabbi while the structure was still a shell as a move aimed at preventing a Modern Orthodox rabbi , who would have been more amenable to a broader utilisation of the site , from getting the position . Rabbi of the Jewish Quarter , <unk> <unk> , has been clear that he wants the building to serve as a synagogue and a house of study . 
 = = Rededication and response = = 
 The reconstructed Hurva was officially opened on March 15 , 2010 in the presence of Israeli politicians and chief rabbis . A day earlier , hundreds of people had accompanied a new Torah scroll into the synagogue . Several Palestinian leaders claimed that the rededication signaled Israel ’ s intent to destroy the Muslim holy places on the Temple Mount and replace it with the Third Temple . Fatah official <unk> Abd el @-@ Khader called the renovation of the Hurva a " provocation " , warned Israel that it was " playing with fire " and called on Palestinians to " converge on Al @-@ Aksa to save it . " Khaled <unk> of Hamas described the synagogue 's opening as " a declaration of war " and called it a " falsification of history and Jerusalem 's religious and historic monuments . " Fearing riots by Arab protestors , over 3 @,@ 000 policemen were deployed ahead of the dedication ceremony . The Organisation of the Islamic Conference said that the reopening risked " dragging the region into a religious war " and claimed the building was historically on a waqf ( Islamic trust ) land . The Jordanian government also condemned the move stating that it " categorically rejects the rededication of Hurva synagogue and all other unilateral Israeli measures in occupied East Jerusalem because they run counter to international legitimacy . " Iran urged the international community to respond to the reopening and a Foreign Ministry spokesman called the move a " catastrophe that has distressed the Islamic world . " Israeli officials countered that Arab fears of a takeover of the Temple Mount were based on rumors and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended a message of coexistence . The U.S. State Department criticised Palestinians for stoking tensions at the rededication of the historic synagogue . The day after , Arabs clashed with Israeli police in East Jerusalem after Palestinian groups called for a " day of rage " over the reopening . 
 In September 2010 , Hamas released a propaganda video showing various Israeli landmarks , including the Hurva synagogue , ablaze after coming under missile attack . The images were the result of special effects , as no such attacks had taken place . 
 = = Cultural depictions = = 
 The Hurva Synagogue , as an emblem of Jerusalem and its Jewish heritage , has been portrayed over the years in numerous paintings , and referred to in literature and culture . The synagogue was portrayed , for example , in works by artists <unk> <unk> , Jonathan Kis @-@ Lev , and in the works of Holocaust survivor , artist <unk> Blum . For decades , the synagogue 's arch has been the emblem of the Jewish quarter in the works of artists portraying the old city . 
 Computer graphic reconstructions of Louis Kahn 's unbuilt project were made by Kent Larson ( MIT , early 1990s ) , and further developed in terms of animation by Francesco <unk> & Federico Caponi ( University of Florence , November 2013 ) .

 Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare / <unk> <unk> <unk> / is a seaside resort in Somerset , England , on the Bristol Channel 18 miles ( 29 km ) south west of Bristol between Worlebury Hill and Bleadon Hill . It includes the suburbs of Oldmixon , West Wick and Worle . Its population at the 2011 census was 76 @,@ 143 . Since 1983 , Weston has been twinned with Hildesheim , Germany . 
 Although there is evidence in the local area of occupation since the Iron Age , it was still a small village until the 19th century when it became a seaside resort , and was connected with local towns and cities by a railway , and two piers were built . The growth continued until the second half of the 20th century , when tourism declined and some local industries closed . A regeneration programme is being undertaken with attractions including the Helicopter Museum , Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare Museum , Grand Pier and an aquarium . The Paddle Steamer Waverley and MV Balmoral offer day sea trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary . Cultural venues include The Playhouse , the Winter Gardens and Blakehay Theatre . 
 Owing to the large tidal range in the Bristol Channel , the low tide mark in Weston Bay is about a mile from the seafront . Although the beach itself is sandy , low tide uncovers areas of thick mud , hence the colloquial name , Weston @-@ super @-@ Mud . These mudflats are very dangerous to walk in and are crossed by the mouth of the River Axe . Just to the north of the town is Sand Point which marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary and the start of the Bristol Channel . It is also the site of the Middle Hope biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) . In the centre of the town is Ellenborough Park , another SSSI due to the range of plant species found there . 
 = = Toponymy = = 
 Weston comes from the Anglo @-@ Saxon for the west tun or settlement ; super Mare is Latin for " above sea " and was added to distinguish it from the many other settlements named Weston in the Diocese . 
 Prior to 1348 it was known as Weston @-@ <unk> @-@ Mare ( " beside the sea " ) . The name was changed by Ralph of Shrewsbury , who was the Bishop of Bath and Wells . Between the 14th and 17th centuries the " super Mare " part of the name disappeared and it was just known as Weston , although in 1610 it was recorded as Weston on the More ; <unk> being the Welsh word for sea .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 Weston 's oldest structure is Worlebury Camp , on Worlebury Hill , dating from the Iron Age . Castle Batch was a castle that once stood overlooking the town . The present site has an earthwork mound of 160 feet ( 49 m ) in diameter which is believed to be the remains of a motte . 
 The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred . 
 The medieval church of St John was demolished in 1824 and built anew on the same site , though a stump of the Medieval preaching cross survives by the exterior south wall . The former rectory is a 17th @-@ century structure with later additions . Though it remains adjacent to the church it has not been a parsonage house since the end of the 19th century . Today it is known as Glebe House and is divided into flats . 
 The Old Thatched Cottage restaurant on the seafront carries the date 1774 ; it is the surviving portion of a summer cottage built by the Revd . William Leeves of Wrington . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 Early in the 19th century , Weston was a small village of about 30 houses , located behind a line of sand dunes fronting the sea , which had been created as an early sea wall after the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 . The Pigott family of Brockley , who were the local Lords of the Manor , had a summer residence at Grove House . Weston owes its growth and prosperity to the Victorian era boom in seaside holidays . Construction of the first hotel in the village started in 1808 ; it was called " Reeves " ( now the Royal Hotel ) . Along with nearby Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea , Weston benefited from proximity to Bristol , Bath and South Wales . The first attempt at an artificial harbour was made in the late 1820s at the islet of Knightstone and a slipway built from Anchor Head towards Birnbeck Island . 
 Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his family lived in Weston , at Swiss Villa ( towards the north end of Trevelyan road , see map 1901 , Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare ) , while he was supervising the construction of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in the area . With the opening of the railway in 1841 , thousands of visitors came to the town from Bristol , the Midlands and further afield , on works outings and Bank holidays . Mining families also came across the Bristol Channel from South Wales by paddle steamer . To cater for them , Birnbeck Pier was completed in 1867 , offering in its heyday amusement arcades , tea rooms , amusement rides and a photographic studio . However , it is now in a derelict state and has been added to English Heritage 's Buildings at Risk Register , but visitors can still admire its structure from behind barbed wire . It was designed by Eugenius Birch with ironwork by the ISCA Foundry of Newport , Monmouthshire . It is a grade II * listed building . 
 Large areas of land were released for development from the 1850s onwards . Large detached villas , for the middle classes , were built on the southern slopes of Worlebury Hill . Semi @-@ detached and terraced housing was built on the low " moorland " behind the sea front in an area known as South Ward . Many of these houses have now been converted into bedsits . Most of the houses built in the Victorian era are built from stone and feature details made from Bath Stone , influenced by local architect Hans Price . 
 In 1885 , the first transatlantic telegraph cable of the Commercial Cable Company was brought ashore and the company started a long association with the town , ending in 1962 . 
 Guglielmo Marconi , the inventor of wireless telegraphy , successfully transmitted radio signals across the Bristol Channel in the spring of 1897 , from Penarth ( near Cardiff ) to Brean Down ( just south west of Weston , on the other side of the River Axe ) . 
 A second railway , the Weston , Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway , opened on 1 December 1897 , connecting Weston to Clevedon . The terminus station was at Ashcombe Road . The railway was extended to Portishead on 7 August 1907 but was closed in 1940 . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 Much of the character of the buildings in the town derives from the use of local stone , much of it from the Town Quarry . Notable among the architects working in the 19th century was Hans Price ( 1835 – 1912 ) . Many examples of his work are still to be seen : the Town Hall , the Mercury Office , the Constitutional Club ( originally the Lodge of St Kew ) , villas and numerous other domestic dwellings . The Odeon Cinema by Thomas Cecil Howitt is notable for fully retaining many Art Deco features both internally and externally , and retaining its original theatre organ , a Compton from 1935 . It is believed to be the only cinema organ in the West Country left working in its original location and is still in regular use . Other organs by Compton in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare can be found at Victoria Methodist Church and All Saints ' Church by George Bodley ( modelled on that in Downside Abbey ) . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 Local traders , unhappy that visitors were not coming as far as the centre of the town , built a new pier closer to the main streets . Opened in 1904 , and known as the Grand Pier , it was designed to be 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) long . Further development occurred after World War I , with the Winter Gardens Pavilion in 1927 , the open air pool , with its arched concrete diving board , and an airfield dating from the inter @-@ war period . Art Deco influences can be seen in much of the town 's architecture from this period . 
 During World War II evacuees were accommodated in the town ; however the area was also home to war industries , such as aircraft and pump manufacture , and a Royal Air Force station at RAF Locking . The town was also on the return route of bombers targeting Bristol and was itself bombed by the Luftwaffe . The first bombs fell in June 1940 , but the worst attacks were in January 1941 and in June 1942 . Large areas of the town were destroyed , particularly Orchard Street and the Boulevard . On 3 and 4 January 1941 , incendiary bombs fell on the town . The Air Ministry set up a " Q @-@ station " decoy at Bleadon in an attempt to divert the bombers to an unpopulated area . In the later part of the war , United States Army troops were billeted in the area , but they were relocated in the run @-@ up to D @-@ Day . 
 RAF Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare was opened in 1936 by No. 24 Group , with a single tarmac runway . It served as a flying candidates selection and initial training facility , and as a relief airport during World War II , latterly as the Polish Air Force Staff College from April 1944 to April 1946 . After the war it served as a logistics supply station , with helicopter makers Westland Helicopters on site until closure in 1987 . Today there is an operational heliport on site used occasionally by the RAF Search and Rescue service . The former Westland site , which closed in 2002 , houses the Helicopter Museum featuring examples of Westland aircraft . Pride of place is given to an immaculate Westland Wessex HCC <unk> , formerly of the Queen 's Flight . 
 Residential areas outside the town centre include the Oldmixon , Coronation , and Bournville housing estates , built in the mid to late 20th century . Newer housing has since been built towards the east of the town in North Worle and Locking Castle , nearer to the M5 motorway . 
 Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare has expanded to include the established villages of Milton , Worle , Uphill , Oldmixon , West Wick and Wick St. Lawrence , as well as new areas such as St. Georges and Locking Castle . 
 In 1986 , Weston General Hospital was opened on the edge of Uphill village , replacing the Queen Alexandra Memorial Hospital on The Boulevard , which was opened in 1928 .

 A structure known as Silica was installed at Big Lamp Corner during 2006 . It is a piece of public art , an advertising sign , a retail kiosk selling newspapers and hot food , as well as a bus shelter . It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to a carrot or a space ship , although it is meant to symbolise man 's harmony with the sea . This was part of North Somerset Council 's ongoing civic pride initiative that has sought to revitalise Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare 's public spaces , which had suffered a period of decline . Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements to the street scene in Grove Park Village . 
 On 28 July 2008 , the pavilion at the end of the Grand Pier was completely destroyed by a fire . Eleven fire engines and 80 fire @-@ fighters were unable to contain the blaze which is believed to have started in the north @-@ east tower of the Pavilion . A competition was held to design a new pavilion , and the project awarded to the winning architect Angus Meek Architects of Bristol . Construction work began on the pier and new pavilion in 2009 , and was scheduled to re @-@ open in July 2010 following a £ 39 million re @-@ building programme . After continuing problems and set @-@ backs leading to the pier not opening until a formal opening ceremony on 23 October 2010 , the overall costs have reached £ 51 million . During the same period a £ 34 million redevelopment of the promenade , including refurbishment of the Marine Lake and pedestrianisation of Pier Square . As part of the work , a scour protection apron and splash wall were added as part of flood prevention measures . 
 At the end of the 20th and start of the 21st centuries , the town saw a growth in residential rehabilitation treatment centres for people with drug and alcohol problems , with attendant crime and social problems . These problems were highlighted by Weston 's councillors , newspapers and the MP , John Penrose during his maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2005 . 
 By 2009 , it was home to around 11 % of drug rehabilitation places in the UK and North Somerset council proposed an accreditation system examining the quality of counselling , staff training , transparency of referral arrangements , along with measures of the treatment 's effectiveness and site inspections . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Municipal history began in 1842 when a Local Act was obtained for " paving , lighting , watching , cleansing and otherwise improving the Town of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare in the County of Somerset and for establishing a Market therein " under the jurisdiction of eighteen appointed Commissioners . Town Commissioners gave way to an Urban District Council in 1894 , and then in 1937 the town received its Royal Charter as a municipal borough . In 1974 , under the Local Government Act 1972 , it was merged into the Woodspring district of the Avon County Council , and became a Charter trustees town . Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare regained its town council in 2000 , becoming a civil parish . The island of Steep Holm is part of the civil parish of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . 
 Before 1 April 1974 , Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare came under the administration of Somerset County Council . When Avon was split up in 1996 , it became the administrative headquarters of the unitary authority of North Somerset , one of the successor authorities , which remains part of the ceremonial county of Somerset . 
 There are 11 electoral wards in Weston . 
 The MP for the Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare parliamentary constituency is John Penrose of the Conservative Party , who won the seat from Liberal Democrat Brian Cotter ( now Lord Cotter ) in the 2005 General Election . 
 Weston is within the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d 'Hondt method of party @-@ list proportional representation . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The mainly flat landscape of Weston is dominated by Worlebury Hill , 109 metres ( 357 ft ) , which borders the entire northern edge of the town , and Bleadon Hill , 176 metres ( 577 ft ) which together with the River Axe , and Brean Down at Uphill form its southern border . In the centre of the town is Ellenborough Park a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the range of plant species found there . 
 The beach of Weston Bay lies on the western edge of the town . The upper part is sandy but the sea retreats a long way at low tide exposing large areas of mud flats ( hence the colloquial name of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mud ) . The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great , and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope , attempting to reach the sea at times of low tide is inadvisable as the sand gives way to mud which is very deep and has frequently resulted in loss of life over the years . Driving on the beach ( which is permitted in certain areas ) occasionally results the drivers of vehicles being caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud and are then stuck . 
 The tidal rise and fall in the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel can be as great as 14 @.@ 5 m ( 48 ft ) , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada . This tidal movement contributes to the deposition of natural mud in bays such as Weston . There has been concern about pollution levels from industrial areas in Wales and at the eastern end of the Bristol Channel , however this tends to be diluted by the Atlantic waters . There are measurable levels of chemical pollutants and little is known about their effects . Of particular concern are the levels of cadmium and to a lesser degree residual pesticides and hydrocarbons . 
 Just to the north of the town is Sand Point which marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary and the start of the Bristol Channel . It is also the site of the Middle Hope 84 @.@ 1 hectares ( 208 acres ) biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Along with the rest of South West England , Weston has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country . The annual mean temperature is approximately 10 ° C ( 50 @.@ 0 ° F ) . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures . The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 ° C ( 69 @.@ 8 ° F ) . In winter mean minimum temperatures of 1 ° C ( 33 @.@ 8 ° F ) or 2 ° C ( 35 @.@ 6 ° F ) are common . In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south @-@ west of England , however convective cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine . Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1 @,@ 600 hours . In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton . Most the rainfall in the south @-@ west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection . Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions , which is when they are most active . In summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms . Average rainfall is around 700 mm ( 28 in ) . About 8 – 15 days of snowfall is typical . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , and June to August have the lightest winds .

 Since the 1970s , Weston has suffered a decline in popularity as a holiday destination , as have most British seaside resorts , due to the advent of cheap foreign holidays and the demise of the traditional " works holidays " of heavy and manufacturing industries elsewhere in UK . The town had become a centre of industries such as helicopter production , and maintenance at the GKN Westland factory until its closure in 2002 , however the company still retains a design office under the name GKN Aerospace Engineering Services at the Winterstoke Road site . Road transport links were improved with the M5 motorway running close by , and the town now supports light industries and distribution depots , including Lidl 's distribution centre for its southern based stores , and is also a dormitory town for Bristol . <unk> , one of the largest semiconductor and video / audio distribution equipment companies in the television broadcasting industry , is based in the town . Two of the town 's largest employers are the local council and Weston College , which has recently begun to offer university degrees as a secondary campus of Bath Spa University .

 Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare is a popular tourist destination , with its long sandy beach , Helicopter Museum , Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare Museum , Grand Pier , <unk> aquarium and seasonal Wheel of Weston . A 2009 survey by Visit England placed the Grand Pier in the top ten free attractions in England . However , as of 2014 , the pier charges for admission . On the Beach Lawns was a miniature railway operated by steam and diesel locomotives , which closed in 2012 . The Paddle Steamer Waverley and MV Balmoral offer day trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn estuary . 
 The Art Deco Tropicana , once a very popular lido on the beach , has suffered years of neglect . It closed to the public in 2000 , and despite a number of attempts to reopen it , permission was given to demolish it in 2012 . 
 <unk> <unk> ' , in association with the Helicopter Museum , are staged at the beach lawns over a long weekend around the end of July , when up to 75 helicopters from Europe fly in for a static display . There are frequent Helicopter Air Experience flights from the Museum heliport . There is also an annual display by the Red Arrows . 
 Since the 1970s the number of visitors staying for several nights in the town has decreased , but the numbers of day visitors has increased . In 1995 there were 4 million visitors but by 2005 this had risen to 5 @.@ 3 million . In 2007 69 % of visitors to the resort were day visitors , compared to 58 % in 2005 . The 2005 survey showed that day visitors stay in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare for an average of six hours whilst overnight visitors stay for an average of five nights . The largest percentage of visitors ( 22 % ) were from the West Midlands . Weston was found to attract two distinct groups : " grey tourists " over the age of 60 and families with young children . 
 Weston Bike Nights are motorcycle meetings on the Promenade each Thursday during the summer . They are organised by The Royal British Legion Riders Branch to raise money for the Poppy Appeal . 
 In July 2011 , North Somerset Council gave planning approval to the £ 50 million Leisure Dome , a 210 @-@ metre ( 690 ft ) indoor ski slope to be built on the site of RAF Locking .

 The 2 @.@ 9 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 4 @.@ 7 km ) 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) gauge Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare Tramways network opened on 12 May 1902 . The main route ran from Birnbeck Pier along the sea front to the Sanatorium ( now Royal Sands ) ; a branch line ran to the railway station and on to the tram depot in Locking Road . The fleet originally consisted of 12 double deck cars and 4 open @-@ sided " toast rack " cars . The system was bought out by the competing bus company and closed on 18 April 1937 , by which time the fleet comprised 8 double deck and 6 " toast racks " . An earlier proposal for the Weston and Clevedon Tramway to run along the streets of the town to the sea front had failed to materialise , leaving the line as an ordinary railway with a terminus in Ashcombe Road . 
 Weston is close to junction 21 of the M5 motorway , to which it is linked by a dual @-@ carriageway relief road built in the 1990s . This replaced Locking Road as the designated A370 route and avoided some of the traffic congestion along that narrower urban road . 
 The Bristol and Exeter Railway arrived in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare on 14 June 1841 . This was not the route that serves today 's Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare railway station , but rather a single @-@ track branch line from Weston Junction , midway between the present day Worle and Uphill junctions , which terminated at a small station in Regent Street close to the High Street . A second larger station was constructed in 1866 to replace this , when planning permission was gained to create a loop station from the main line . After legal action was taken by residents along the proposed route new route through issues of planning blight , the station on the current site was constructed in 1881 . 
 Today the station is situated close to the town centre and less than ten minutes walk from the sea front . It has direct services to London Paddington operated by First Great Western , and also trains to stations such as Bristol , Taunton and Cardiff Central . CrossCountry services run to Birmingham and the North . The station has two platforms . Other stations are located at Weston Milton and Worle . During the middle of the day they are served by the local trains between Taunton , Bristol and Cardiff , but during the peak periods London trains call at both stations . Weston Milton station is on the single track loop and therefore has only one platform , while Worle is on the main line and has two side platforms . The Weston loop diverges just to the southwest of Worle station , and the junction is therefore known as Worle Junction . 
 Most bus services are provided by First Somerset & Avon or Webberbus . All services call at stops in the Regent Street and Big Lamp Corner area , including some stops in the adjacent High Street . Some town services and those to Sand Bay , Wells , Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea and Bristol Airport start from or run via the main railway station . The service to Sand Bay is sometimes operated by an open top bus . National Express and Bakers Dolphin operate long distance coach services , mostly from the coach terminal in Locking Road Car Park which is close to the railway station . 
 The nearest operational airport to Weston is Bristol Airport , located 15 mi ( 24 km ) away at Lulsgate .

 Knightstone Island housed a theatre , swimming pool and sauna , after having been purchased by the physician Edward Long Fox in 1830 to create a therapeutic spa with range of hot , cold and chemical baths . After years of disrepair and dereliction , the area has been redeveloped by <unk> Homes . During 2006 / 2007 , luxury apartments and commercial outlets have been built on the site . Consideration has been taken due to the listed building status of much of the site . Boat trips from here include the Waverley and Balmoral and trips to Steep Holm and Flat Holm islands as well as short trips around Weston Bay . 
 The Tropicana outdoor swimming pool that is located on the southern section of the sea front has not been occupied since 2000 .

The redevelopment was beset by delays and controversy . A group of local residents challenged the council over its decision to appoint Henry Boot , asking to put forward their own proposals for the site . In November 2009 , the plans were finally abandoned , leaving the future of the site uncertain . In 2010 the council invited submissions from developers for a new , less ambitious , scheme to redevelop the site with a swimming pool at its heart . A decision on a new scheme is expected towards the end of 2010 . The local authority announced on 23 August 2011 that it was giving developers six months to propose plans for a smaller development otherwise they will arrange to demolish the Tropicana . In February 2013 , North Somerset Council granted planning permission to a consortium of local businesses who intend to build a new swimming pool complex on the site .

 = Hurricane Martha = 
 Hurricane Martha has been the only known tropical cyclone to make landfall in Panama . The eighteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season , Martha developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 21 . Initially , the storm developed with sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , skipping tropical depression status . It remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane . Martha attained maximum sustained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) on November 22 . Subsequently , Martha weakened and drifted southward . On November 24 , Martha made landfall in Veraguas Province , Panama , as a strong tropical storm . The system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on November 25 . 
 Because the storm weakened prior to landfall , strong winds were not expected or reported in the impacted countries . In Panama , more than 13 inches ( 330 mm ) of precipitation may have fallen in some areas . Agricultural land was flooded in Almirante , Bocas del Toro and streets became inundated in low @-@ lying areas of Puerto Armuelles , Chiriquí . The storm also brought significant rains to Costa Rica . Flooding and mudslides isolated most of the capital city of San José . Numerous streets were inundated in Golfito . Damage in Costa Rica reached $ 30 million ( 1969 USD ) and 5 deaths were reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Winds aloft in the vicinity of San Andrés , Colombia and the Panama Canal Zone indicated that a low @-@ level circulation developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 20 . According to the Best Track , Tropical Storm Martha formed at 1200 UTC on November 21 , with an initial wind speed of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Thus , Martha skipped tropical depression status . Centered about 100 miles ( 160 km ) northeast of Bocas Town , Bocas del Toro , the storm remained stationary for 24 hours after tropical cyclogenesis . Martha immediately began deepening , becoming a hurricane at 0000 UTC on November 22 . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories at 0300 UTC and erroneously indicated that it was a tropical depression and noted that conditions did not favor significant intensification . Later on November 22 , a reconnaissance flight indicated Martha deepened to a compact hurricane , and the tropical cyclone attained a maximum sustained wind speed of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) . Reconnaissance aircraft measured a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar ( 29 inHg ) , though it was later corrected to 979 mbar ( 28 @.@ 92 inHg ) in the post @-@ season analysis . 
 The eye feature was about 46 miles ( 74 km ) wide and it was described as poorly organized , although convection was increasing . After reaching peak intensity , Martha began drifting due south and slowly weakened . At 1200 UTC on November 23 , the tropical cyclone diminished to a tropical storm , after winds decreased to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and a reconnaissance flight recorded an increased barometric pressure of 999 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) . The storm maintained that intensity , and shortly before 1800 UTC on November 24 , Martha made landfall in rural Veraguas Province , Panama , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) east of the mouth of the <unk> River . Operationally , winds were thought to be only 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) when the storm moved inland . Martha was the only tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in Panama , although it is possible that other Panama tropical cyclones were not detected . The storm rapidly weakened inland , deteriorating to tropical depression status early on November 25 , twelve hours before dissipating over southern <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Residents were warned to anticipate tides 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) above normal near the expected point of landfall . Later , the forecast was decreased to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) above normal and pertained to tides in the Mosquitoes Gulf and <unk> Lagoon . Since Martha was a relatively weak tropical cyclone , flash floods were emphasized as the greatest threat . The National Hurricane Center stated that rainfall could exceed 10 inches ( 254 mm ) . Additionally , Arnold Sugg of National Hurricane Center warned residents of gale force winds and heavy precipitation , advising people living between Bluefields , Nicaragua and Almirante , Bocas del Toro , Panama to take precautions . 
 In Panama , the storm dropped at least 13 inches ( 330 mm ) of precipitation , especially in the western portions of the country . As a result , at least half of agricultural land in Almirante , Bocas del Toro , was flooded , causing extensive crop damage . In Puerto Armuelles , Chiriquí , persistent rainfall led to street flooding and inundated other areas . Similar conditions were reported in Golfito , Costa Rica . The effects of Martha resulted in five deaths , all of which occurred in Costa Rica . The nation incurred flooding from heavy rainfall , which caused significant destruction . The capital city of San José received flooding . In all , damages were estimated near $ 30 million ( 1969 USD ) . 
 = Heinrich Rau = 
 Heinrich Gottlob " Heiner " Rau ( 2 April 1899 – 23 March 1961 ) was a German communist politician during the time of the Weimar Republic ; subsequently , during the Spanish Civil War , he was a leading member of the International Brigades and after World War II an East German statesman . 
 Rau grew up in a suburb of Stuttgart , where early on he became active in socialist youth organizations . After military service in World War I , he participated in the German Revolution of 1918 @-@ 19 . From 1920 onward , he was a leading agricultural policy maker of the Communist Party of Germany ( KPD ) . This ended in 1933 , when Adolf Hitler came to power . Shortly afterward Rau was thrown in jail for two years . As an enemy of the Nazi regime in Germany he was imprisoned , in total , for more than half of the time of Hitler 's reign . After his first imprisonment he emigrated in 1935 to the Soviet Union ( USSR ) . From there , in 1937 , he went on to Spain , where he participated in the Spanish Civil War as a leader of one of the International Brigades . In 1939 , he was arrested in France , and was delivered by the Vichy regime back to Nazi Germany in 1942 . After a few months in a Gestapo prison , he was transferred to the Mauthausen Concentration Camp in March 1943 . While in the concentration camp he participated in conspiratorial prisoner activities , which led to a camp uprising in the final days before the end of World War II in Europe . 
 After the war he played an important role in the political scene of East Germany . Before the establishment of an East German state he was the chairman of the German Economic Commission , the precursor to the East German government . Subsequently he became chairman of the National Planning Commission of East Germany and a deputy chairman of the East German Council of Ministers . He was a leading economic politician and diplomat of East Germany and led various ministries at different times . Within East Germany 's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany ( SED ) he was a member of the party 's CC Politburo .

 Rau was born in Feuerbach , now a part of Stuttgart , in the German Kingdom of Württemberg , the son of a peasant who later became a factory worker . He grew up in the adjacent city of Zuffenhausen , now also a part of Stuttgart . After finishing school in spring 1913 , he started work as a press operator in a shoe factory . In November 1913 he changed his employer and moved to the Bosch factory works in Feuerbach . There he completed his training as metal <unk> and remained until autumn 1920 , with interruptions due to war service during 1917 @-@ 1918 and the subsequent German Revolution of 1918 @-@ 1919 . 
 From 1913 Rau also was active in the labour movement . In that year he joined the metal workers ' union ( Deutscher <unk> ) and a social democratic youth group in Zuffenhausen . During the following years , which saw the beginning of World War I , Rau 's youth group , whose leader he became in 1916 , was significantly influenced by the left wing of the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) . The leftists considered the war a conflict between " imperialist powers " . A few local members of a far left SPD group , among them Edwin Hoernle and Albert Schreiner , who later became well @-@ known members of the Spartacus League ( <unk> ) , visited the youth group in Zuffenhausen and gave lectures . In 1916 , Rau joined the Spartacists as well and became a co @-@ founder of their youth organisation . In accordance with the politics of the Spartacists , in 1917 he joined the left @-@ wing Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany ( USPD ) and in 1919 the Communist Party of Germany ( KPD ) , which had been founded mainly by members of the Spartacus League . 
 In spring 1917 , Rau , by this time an elected trade union official in his firm , participated in the attempt to organise a strike against the war . His action led to a reprimand from his employer , and may have hastened his conscription into the army in August 1917 . In the army he was trained in the Zuffenhausen @-@ garrisoned Infantry Regiment 126 and deployed to the Western Front as member of a machine gun company . In September 1918 a shell splinter penetrated his lungs . In the following weeks , he was treated in military hospitals in Weimar and in Stuttgart 's neighbouring town Ludwigsburg . While in Ludwigsburg , Rau managed to get leave at short notice on 8 November 1918 and joined the in those days developing revolution in Stuttgart . 
 = = = = Revolution = = = = 
 The revolution in November 1918 led in Württemberg , like everywhere in Germany , to the end of the monarchy . King William II left Stuttgart on 9 November , shortly after a revolutionary crowd had stormed his residence , the Wilhelm Palais and flown a red flag above the building . On the very same day the demonstrators were also able to seize some of Stuttgart 's barracks , where parts of the garrisons openly joined them . Rau took active part in the events in Stuttgart 's streets on this and the following day . 
 These happenings were a first cumulation of a civil commotion , that had started a few days earlier with large strikes and demonstrations . On 4 November 1918 , a first workers ' council under the leadership of the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Spartacist Fritz <unk> had been established in Stuttgart . During the following days and weeks more spontaneously elected worker and soldier councils were formed , and took over a large part of Württemberg . Rau was elected leader of the military police in his home city of Zuffenhausen , a part of Stuttgart 's urban area . 
 As early as 9 November , about 150 councillors gathered for a two @-@ day meeting in Stuttgart . A majority of the councillors entrusted the leaders of the SPD and USPD political parties , who had been invited to the meeting , with the establishment of a provisional government in Württemberg . The Spartacist Albert Schreiner , then chairman of a soldier council , initially assumed the key position of Minister of War in this quickly established first government , which for the time being shared power with the councils . However , he resigned already a few days later , after disputes about the future course of the government . While the Spartacists considered as their ideal aim the kinds of results achieved by the previous year 's October Revolution in Russia , the position of the other USPD politicians was unclear and the SPD leaders supported a parliamentary democracy and early elections in Württemberg . 
 During the ensuing months the communists tried repeatedly to seize power in Stuttgart and other cities in Württemberg through armed rebellion , accompanied by large @-@ scale strikes . They seized public buildings and print offices . During one such an attempt - at the beginning of April 1919 when the Bavarian Soviet Republic was formally proclaimed in Munich - a general strike took place in the Stuttgart area . The government in Stuttgart imposed a state of emergency and 16 people died in street fights . At the time of these events , Rau used his position as chief of the military police in Zuffenhausen to shut down companies that remained operational while the strike was ongoing . However , when the strike collapsed , Rau was removed from office by the government . 
 Rau resumed his employment at Bosch in Feuerbach . During another general strike in several Württemberg cities , from 28 August to 4 September 1920 , he led the strike committee in his firm , which resulted in his dismissal . 
 = = = = Influences = = = = 
 From 1919 until 1920 Rau was head of the local KPD group in Zuffenhausen , and chaired the KPD organisation in Stuttgart . The party leader in Württemberg at this time was Edwin Hoernle . Hoernle had visited Rau 's youth group in Zuffenhausen and had become a long @-@ standing friend ; he was an influential teacher for Rau and made his voluminous library available to Rau to use . 
 The most outstanding ideological authority of the movement in Stuttgart , during the time of Rau 's political involvement there , was however Clara Zetkin . She was a founding member of the Second International , about whom Friedrich Engels once had written , that he liked her very much , while emperor Wilhelm II is said to have referred to her as the " worst witch in Germany " . She had been living in a Stuttgart suburb since 1891 and , since then , been gathering a circle of Württemberg Marxists around her , among them Rau 's friend Hoernle , who had been editing with her the magazine Die <unk> . Her house , built in 1903 in <unk> ( now a part of Stuttgart ) , had become a meeting place of leading national and local left @-@ wing and communist activists . It was also visited by international communist leaders like Vladimir Lenin , who stayed there overnight in 1907 . In 1920 , when Zetkin was elected to the Reichstag in Berlin , Hoernle and Rau moved to Berlin as well . 
 = = = Berlin = = = 
 In November 1920 Rau became a full @-@ time party functionary and the secretary of the agricultural division of the Central Committee of the KPD in Berlin . Between 1921 and 1930 he lectured at the Land and Federal schools of the KPD , and edited a few left @-@ wing agricultural journals . 
 The head of the Central Committee 's Division for Agriculture initially was Edwin Hoernle , with whom Rau had come from Stuttgart . Hoernle had been elected to the Executive Committee of the Comintern ( <unk> ) in November 1922 and Rau succeeded him as division chief the following year . Afterwards , Rau also became a leading member of various national and international left wing farmer and peasant organisations . From 1923 onward , he was a member of the Secretariat of the International Committee of the Agricultural and Forest Workers and beginning in 1924 of the executive committee of the Reich Peasant Federation ( <unk> ) . In 1930 this was followed with a membership on the International Peasants ' Council in Moscow and in 1931 he became an office member of the European Peasant Committee . From 1928 to 1933 he was also member of the <unk> Landtag , the Prussian federal state parliament . There he joined the committee on agricultural affairs of the parliament and became its chairman . 
 = = Imprisonment , International Brigades , World War II = = 
 After Hitler 's rise to power in January 1933 and the subsequent suppression of the KPD , Rau became a Central Committee 's party instructor for southwest Germany and was active in building an underground party organisation there . On 23 May 1933 Rau was arrested and on 11 December 1934 convicted , together with Bernhard <unk> , for " preparations to commit high treason " by the People 's Court of Germany . He was sentenced to two years imprisonment . After his release from custody , he emigrated to the USSR in August 1935 , via Czechoslovakia , and became a deputy chairman of the International Agrarian Institute in Moscow . 
 After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and following the formation of the International Brigades , Rau attended a school for military commanders in Ryazan ( USSR ) , and subsequently went to Spain . After his arrival in April 1937 , he joined the XI International Brigade and participated in the civil war as political commissar , beginning in May 1937 , then as chief of staff and finally commander of the brigade , until March 1938 , when he was injured . Although the brigade achieved some temporary successes during these months , Francisco Franco 's troops were already on the road to victory . Rau 's brigade saw combat in the battles of Brunete , Belchite , Teruel and the Aragon Offensive , where Rau was wounded . 
 When Rau took charge of the XI Brigade , he might have been at odds with his predecessor , Richard <unk> , the future son @-@ in @-@ law of KPD leader Wilhelm Pieck . This was the time of the Great Purge which had its echos in Spain , and it could be perilous to have powerful enemies . André Marty , the chief commissar of the International Brigades based at Albacete , was also an executor of the Great Purge in Spain . Following Rau 's injury , Marty managed to imprison him under a pretext for a brief time . A report , written in Moscow in 1940 , described Rau as a " political criminal " , who had had contact with the Spanish anarchists and members of the Workers ' Party of Marxist Unification ( POUM ) , which was demonized as " Trotskyist " . These were serious allegations in this time , when accusations of Trotskyism frequently led to a death sentence if the accused was within reach of the authorities . 
 It seems , however , that Rau also had influential friends . He was released from prison and expelled from Spain . He moved to France in May 1938 . There , he was in charge of the emergency committee of the German and Austrian Spain fighters and member of the KPD country leadership in Paris until 1939 . At the beginning of 1939 Rau crossed the border to Spain again and subsequently led , together with Ludwig Renn , the remainders of the XI Brigade . Together with other remaining international units – now combined in the " Agrupación Internacional " – they fought on Spain 's northern border after the fall of Barcelona , protecting the stream of refugees escaping to France . Thus the Agrupación enabled the escape of perhaps some 470 @,@ 000 civilians and soldiers . 
 Rau was arrested by the French authorities in September 1939 and sent to Camp Vernet , an internment centre in France , and in November 1941 to a secret prison in Castres . In June 1942 , he was handed over to the Gestapo by the Vichy regime and was held until March 1943 in the Gestapo prison in the Prince Albrecht Street . Afterwards he was sent to the Mauthausen Concentration Camp , where he remained until May 1945 , when he participated in a camp rebellion as one of the organisers of a secret military camp organisation .

 When the war was over , Rau went to Vienna for some weeks and helped the KPD representatives in the city gather liberated political prisoners from Germany . He left Vienna in July 1945 , when he led a car convoy with 120 former Mauthausen inmates to the Soviet occupied part of Berlin . 
 In September 1945 , the Soviets appointed Rau a member of the provisional chairmanship of the Province of Brandenburg with the title of a vice @-@ president and responsibility for food , agriculture and forests . Rau succeeded Edwin Hoernle , who had held this position since the end of June and became chairman of the central administration for agriculture and forests in the Soviet Occupation Zone ( <unk> ) . In his new position , Rau was a member of the commission for the execution of the land reform in the province . In spring 1946 he assumed responsibility for economy and transport in Brandenburg . In this capacity , he was , from June 1946 onwards , chairman of the newly established sequester commission in the province . 1946 was also the year of the forced merger of eastern KPD and eastern SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany ( SED ) , resulting in Rau 's membership in the SED . Important 1946 events in Brandenburg were in November elections , which preceded an official status change from a province to a federal state in the following year . Afterwards , from 1946 until 1948 , Rau was state parliament delegate and Minister for Economic Planning of Brandenburg . 
 = = = = German Economic Commission = = = = 
 In March 1948 Rau became chairman of the German Economic Commission ( Deutsche <unk> or DWK ) , which during this period became the centralised administrative organisation for the Soviet Occupation Zone and the predecessor of the future East German government . The organisation existed during a time of very difficult challenges coming from different sides . A particularly momentous event during this time was the currency reform of 1948 . On 20 June 1948 the western German zones introduced a new currency , leaving the eastern zone to use the old common currency . In order to avoid inflation , the DWK under Rau 's leadership , was forced to follow quickly with its own reform and issued an own currency too . In doing so , the DWK also exploited the currency reform to redistribute capital by using different exchange rates for private and state @-@ run companies . The disagreement , which of the two new currencies should be used in Berlin , triggered the Berlin Blockade by the USSR and the western airborne supply of West Berlin . 
 Under Rau 's leadership the DWK , still under supervision of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany ( German : <unk> <unk> in Deutschland or SMAD ) , quickly developed more and more into a partner of the SMAD with its own conceptions and intentions . This policy was also endorsed by the Soviet chief diplomat in Germany , Vladimir <unk> , the future Chief Commissar of the USSR in Germany , who already in January 1948 correspondingly stated , that SMAD orders , ( which accompanied DWK orders , ) should have merely the purpose to back the authority of the German orders . One of Rau 's aims during the meetings with the SMAD was , to come to agreements , which also obliged the Soviet side , including subordinate Soviet authorities , who still engaged in wild confiscations for reparation purposes . An important success in this direction was a half @-@ year plan for the economic development in the second half of 1948 , which was accepted by the SMAD in May 1948 . It was followed by a likewise accepted two @-@ year plan for 1949 and 1950 . 
 The biggest obstacle to the plan 's implementation soon proved to be the Berlin Blockade by the USSR , which was followed by a western counter @-@ blockade of the Soviet occupation zone . As there were long @-@ established economic ties between the western zone and the eastern , which was highly dependent on supplies from the West , the blockade was more damaging to the East . The West Berlin SPD newspaper <unk> reported in April 1949 , how Rau clearly criticized the blockade in a meeting of SED apparatchiks and there is reason to believe that he did the same in the meetings with the SMAD . According to the paper , Rau spoke of a " bad speculation " regarding the undervaluation of the dependence on western supplies , stating that the " broadminded Soviet help " turned out as insufficient and hinting that the blockade would soon be lifted . Finally the Berlin Blockade was lifted on 12 May 1949 . 
 The DWK 's increasingly centralised administration resulted in a substantial increase in its staffing level , which grew from about 5000 employees in mid @-@ 1948 to 10 @,@ 000 by the beginning of 1949 . In March 1949 , Rau , like the representative of a state , signed a first treaty with a foreign state , a trade agreement with Poland .

 The time of Rau 's German Economic Commission ended in October 1949 with the establishment of the East German state , the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) . The GDR was proclaimed on 7 October 1949 , at a ceremony in the former Air Ministry Building in Berlin , until then the seat of Rau 's organisation . Five days later , the DWK was formally abolished on 12 October 1949 . Rau thereupon became a delegate of the People 's Chamber , the newly established parliament of the GDR and joined the new government . 
 Likewise in 1949 , the ruling SED implemented traditional leadership structures of communist parties and Rau became a member of the newly established Central Committee of the SED and candidate member of its Politburo ; in 1950 he became a full member of the Politburo as well as deputy chairman of the East German Council of Ministers . 
 Between 1949 and 1950 , Rau was Minister for Planning of the GDR and in 1950 – 1952 chairman of the National Planning Commission . In this position , as the key figure of the economic development , Rau came into conflict with SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht . In the face of an imminent economic collapse , Rau blamed the " Bureau Ulbricht " for the wrong policy . In response East Germany 's old president Wilhelm Pieck renewed the old accusation of Trotskyism against Rau . In a later letter to Pieck of 28 November 1951 , Rau protested at the manner in which the Secretariat usurped the Politburo by censoring his speech on economic affairs . 
 In 1952 – 1953 , Rau led the newly established Coordination Centre for Industry and Traffic at the East German Council of Ministers . The purpose of this office was effective control of the economy in order to overcome the difficulties , which were caused by a grown bureaucracy and unclear decision paths . Prime Minister Otto <unk> described this in a talk with Joseph Stalin . 
 After the death of Stalin in March 1953 , the new collective Soviet leadership started to advocate a New Course . Moscow favored replacing East Germany 's Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and made inquiries about Rau as a potential candidate . In response , the leading SED party ideologist , Rudolf <unk> , a candidate member of the <unk> , with assistance from Rau drew up a concept for just such a New Course in East Germany . However , the workers ' uprising , which was suppressed by the Soviet army on 17 June led to a backlash . Three weeks later , during a session of the then eight person Politburo ( plus six candidate members ) on 8 July 1953 , Rau made a recommendation that Ulbricht be replaced , while Rau 's Spanish Civil War comrade , Stasi chief Wilhelm <unk> , who in Spain had been known as ' General Gómez ' , accused Ulbricht of having perverted the party . The majority was against Ulbricht . His only supporters were Hermann <unk> and Erich Honecker . At that moment however there was no viable candidate who could replace Ulbricht immediately . Suggested were first Rudolf <unk> and then Heinrich Rau , but both were hesitant , thus a decision was postponed . The very next day after the meeting Ulbricht went by plane to Moscow and the Soviet leadership , who in part also feared that deposing Ulbricht might be construed as a sign of weakness , now secured Ulbricht 's position . Subsequently five members and candidate members of the Politburo lost their positions .

 = = = = Competition in the Politburo and economic reform = = = = 
 Unlike some other rebels in the leadership , Rau kept most of his positions . He remained a member of the Politburo and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers . In the Politburo he continued to be responsible for the industry of the GDR . However , his position had been weakened . Bruno Leuschner , a follower of Ulbricht and Rau 's successor as chairman of the National Planning Commission , now became a new candidate member of the Politburo . During the ensuing period , Leuschner , often supported by Ulbricht , gradually superseded Rau as the senior leader for the economy as a whole . The official GDR press never mentioned the dissension between Rau and Leuschner and always described their cooperation as a success story . 
 Concentrating on his tasks in the SED leadership and as a minister , Rau – despite occasional internal criticism – avoided giving the impression of any disagreement with Ulbricht , at least in public . In 1954 , Rau received in the Order of Merit for the Fatherland ( <unk> <unk> ) in gold . Later , Ulbricht stated in a 1964 interview about the " introduction of socialism " in the GDR , that only three people were heavily involved in the economic development during that time , " namely Heinrich Rau , Bruno Leuschner and me . Others were not consulted ! " 
 In 1953 – 1955 Rau led the new established Ministry for Machine Construction , which combined the responsibilities of three existing ministries . His deputy in this ministry was Erich Apel , who would , in the early 1960s , become an initiator and architect of an economic reform , which became known as the New Economic System ( NES ) . This later reform was presaged by a reform in the middle of the 1950s ; the economic historian Jörg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this reform . The origin of the reform in the 1950s was a scientific study , commissioned by Rau 's ministry in 1953 , to assess the need for greater economic efficiency in the factories . The subsequent results from this study promised enhanced economic efficiency by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves . <unk> , already in spring 1954 , Rau advocated such a planning reform , while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it . In August 1954 , Rau 's ministry sent a concept for such a reform to Leuschner 's State Planning Commission . Eventually this reform got under way , after Ulbricht , perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger , had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too . Subsequently the reform accelerated until 1956 . It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957 . <unk> in other Eastern Bloc countries during the previous year 1956 , in particular in Hungary , had awoken the desire for more central control again . The subsequent unsatisfying economic development , however , during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning reform , the NES . 
 = = = = Foreign trade and foreign policy = = = = 
 Between 1955 – 1961 Rau served as Minister for Foreign Trade and Inter @-@ German Trade . The term " Inter @-@ German Trade " meant the trade with West Germany . In this time both German states still saw German reunification as their own aim , but both envisaging different political systems . The West German position was that they , as the only freely elected government , had an exclusive mandate for the entire German people . In consequence of this , the GDR 's official diplomatic relationships with other states were narrowed to the states of the Eastern Bloc . Practically no other states recognized the GDR . As a result , Rau 's ministry established numerous new " trade missions " in other states , which served as a kind of surrogate for nonexistent embassies . It was a corollary , that Rau , in addition to his responsibility for the export @-@ oriented industry , also chaired the Foreign Policy Commission of the SED Politburo ( <unk> Kommission <unk> Politbüro or <unk> ) since 1955 , in this period the actual decision @-@ making body for foreign affairs , and visited other states in different parts of the world in this capacity . Among the visited states were , beside the core states of the Soviet Bloc , also then Eastern Bloc peripheral states , like China and Albania and leading states of the crystallizing Non @-@ Aligned Movement like India and Yugoslavia ( after the Bandung Conference ) . Between 1955 and 1957 he visited , as part of a diplomatic advertisement campaign in the Arab world , various Arabic states , among them repeatedly Egypt . One of his last deals , which he closed as minister , was a trade agreement with Cuba , signed by Cuba 's minister Ernesto ' Che ' Guevara , on 17 December 1960 in East Berlin . 
 Rau , in poor health during his final years , died of a heart attack in East Berlin , in March 1961 . 
 = = Aftermath and legacy = = 
 After his death , firms , schools , recreation homes , numerous streets , and a fighter squadron were named after him . The GDR issued a stamp with his picture three times . 
 Rau was married twice and had three sons and a daughter . Like the other members of the Politburo , he lived until 1960 in a secured area of East Berlin 's district Pankow and moved in 1960 to the <unk> near <unk> . In Pankow he had lived in <unk> . In 1963 , Rau 's widow Elisabeth moved to this street again . 
 When the prominent West German SPD politician and future President of Germany Johannes Rau visited an SPD rally in the East German city of Erfurt during the time of German reunification , he was introduced as " Prime Minister ' Heinrich Rau ' " . Thereupon Johannes Rau ironically commented on this lapse by observing that Heinrich Rau was a " Minister of Trade , a Swabian and a communist " and he was none of the three . 
 = Washington State Route 261 = 
 State Route 261 ( SR 261 ) is a 62 @.@ 71 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 100 @.@ 92 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Washington . Serving Columbia , Franklin , and Adams counties , the highway begins at U.S. Route 12 ( US 12 ) east of Starbuck and becomes concurrent with SR 260 from Kahlotus to SR 26 in Washtucna before ending at Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) and US 395 in Ritzville . The highway has been legislated since 1937 from Ritzville to Washtucna as Secondary State Highway 11E ( SSH 11E ) and in 1957 from <unk> to the Starbuck area as a branch of SSH 11B . The two secondary highways became SR 261 during the 1964 highway renumbering , and a gap between Washtucna and Starbuck was not paved until the construction of the Snake River Bridge was completed in 1968 .

 SR 261 begins its 62 @.@ 71 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 100 @.@ 92 km ) route at an intersection with US 12 east of the town of Starbuck in rural Columbia County . The roadway travels north over the <unk> Creek and turns west , paralleling the Tucannon River through Starbuck and to the south bank of the Snake River . The highway passes over a rail bridge owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation before turning northwest and crossing the steel cantilever Snake River Bridge , listed on the National Register of Historic Places , into Franklin County near Lyons Ferry Park . At the north end of the bridge , SR 261 continues northwest , passing under a Union Pacific Railroad bridge and near Palouse Falls State Park , before crossing the Columbia Plateau Trail and intersecting SR 260 northeast of Kahlotus . A concurrency with SR 260 travels northeast into Adams County parallel to the Columbia Plateau Trail in the Palouse before entering Washtucna and being designated as Main Street . Main Street intersects SR 26 , forming the eastern terminus of SR 260 , after the Columbia Plateau Trail turns east . SR 261 continues north into farmland and crosses the John Wayne Pioneer Trail in Ralston before its northern terminus at a diamond interchange with I @-@ 90 and US 395 southeast of Ritzville , becoming Division Street as it serves the city . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that between 300 and 3 @,@ 000 vehicles per day used the highway , mostly between Washtucna and Ritzville .

 The Mullan Road was constructed in 1862 and crossed the Snake River with a ferry crossing at Lyons Ferry until the construction of the Lower Monumental Dam downstream caused the water level to rise and longer wait times , resulting in the reconstruction of the Snake River Bridge . The current route of SR 261 from Washtucna to Ritzville was designated during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937 as SSH 11E . A branch of SSH 11B was added in 1957 that extended from <unk> to US 410 , later an extension of US 12 , east of Starbuck with an un @-@ built bridge over the Snake River at Lyons Ferry . Both highways became SR 261 during the 1964 highway renumbering , but the section between Starbuck and Washtucna was not paved . The completion of the Snake River Bridge in 1968 , using the dismantled steel cantilevered Vantage Bridge and listed onto the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 , finished the highway . No major revisions of the highway have occurred since the construction of the bridge in 1968 .

 = Subtropical Storm Nicole ( 2004 ) = 
 Subtropical Storm Nicole was the first subtropical storm to receive a name using the standard hurricane name list that did not become a tropical cyclone . The fourteenth tropical or subtropical storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season , Nicole developed on October 10 near Bermuda from the interaction of an upper level trough and a cold front . The storm turned to the northeast , and after attempting to transition into a tropical cyclone , it dissipated as it was absorbed into a larger extratropical storm . 
 Nicole dropped moderate amounts of rainfall in Bermuda , while rough seas caused problems for cruise lines . In Canada , the remnants of the storm combined with an extratropical storm produced strong winds and rainfall , damaging trees and power lines . The remnant storm also produced gusty winds across New England , while swells from the storm provided welcome surf conditions along the East Coast of the United States . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 An upper @-@ level trough and a decaying cold front persisted across the western Atlantic Ocean in early October . The interaction between the two led to the formation of an area of low pressure on October 8 to the southwest of Bermuda . The system lacked a single well @-@ defined circulation , though it possessed gale force winds as it moved northwestward . The system gradually became better organized , and though there were no signs of tropical development on October 9 , computer models suggested a subtropical storm could form . On October 10 , a well @-@ defined low @-@ level circulation developed as a band of clouds formed in the northern portion of the system . Shortly thereafter , curved bands developed in the northwestern portion of the center , while the strongest winds associated with the storm occurred more than 115 miles ( 185 km ) from the center . Based on the broad wind field and the cloud signature , it is estimated the system organized into Subtropical Storm Nicole on October 10 while located about 140 miles ( 225 km ) southwest of Bermuda . 
 The first National Hurricane Center forecast on Nicole noted the development of convection over the western portion of the center , and that if the trend continued , transitioning into a tropical cyclone would be possible . The first discussion also predicted a peak intensity of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . A mid @-@ level trough turned the storm northeastward , and early on October 11 it passed about 60 miles ( 95 km ) northwest of Bermuda . Shortly after passing Bermuda , Nicole developed persistent deep convection near the center , while Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit overpasses indicated the potential of a warm core within the system . Though Nicole attempted to acquire tropical characteristics , strong upper @-@ level wind shear prevented the transition . As the storm accelerated northeastward under the influence of a large extratropical storm south of Nova Scotia , it briefly reached peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Subtropical Storm Nicole lost its circulation as it was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm on October 11 . 
 = = Preparations , impact , and naming = = 
 On October 9 , one day prior to Nicole forming , the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale warning for the island . The agency also issued a Tropical Storm Watch shortly after the storm developed . All warnings were canceled after the storm passed the island . Winds on Bermuda peaked at 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) in association with Nicole , while gusts peaked at 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) prior to the storm developing . Nicole and the precursor extratropical storm dropped heavy precipitation , amounting to 5 @.@ 86 inches ( 148 mm ) over a three @-@ day period at the Bermuda International Airport . Thunderstorms were also reported on the island . Poor weather conditions from Nicole forced the cancellation of several events at the tourist @-@ driven Bermuda Music Festival , including acts by Isaac Hayes , Gerald Albright , and Anita Baker . Strong winds knocked down power lines , leaving over 1 @,@ 800 homes and businesses without power . Unsettled conditions also resulted in airport delays . High winds delayed or altered the courses of four cruise ships . High waves of 10 to 12 @-@ foot ( 3 to 3 @.@ 6 m ) in height left several cruise ship passengers seasick ; one sick person was rushed to a local hospital on Bermuda . 
 The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued seven bulletins on the storm , though the system only briefly entered the centre 's response zone before it dissipated . Due to moisture from Nicole combined with the extratropical storm , the Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for large portions of the Canadian Maritimes . The remnants of Nicole , combined with a powerful extratropical storm , produced strong winds across the Maritimes , including over 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) on western Cape Breton . The strong winds uprooted trees and downed power lines , while the winds combined with rough seas cancelled ferry crossings and restricted access to the Confederation Bridge . The storm complex also dropped over 2 inches ( 60 mm ) of rainfall , causing flooding in eastern Nova Scotia . The storm 's passage during the middle of apple harvest caused troubles for Annapolis Valley . 
 The remnants of Nicole , combined with the extratropical storm , produced strong winds in New England , with gusts of up to 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . In Maine , the winds snapped branches off trees , and also downed trees and power lines . Power outages were reported , primarily in coastal portions of Washington and Hancock Counties . Nicole produced moderate swells along the East Coast of the United States . Conditions for surfing were best in New York and Rhode Island , where swells of over 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) occurred . 
 Eleven ships reported tropical storm force winds in association with Subtropical Storm Nicole . The maximum recorded wind was 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) while the storm was at peak intensity , while the minimum recorded pressure was 995 mbar as Nicole was being absorbed by the extratropical storm . 
 Since 2002 , subtropical storms have been assigned names from the same naming sequence as tropical storms . Nicole was the first named subtropical storm since the policy change to not achieve full tropical cyclone status . In 1972 and 1973 , four subtropical storms were named using the Phonetic alphabet , while all other subtropical cyclones remained unnamed . 
 = National Archives of Malta = 
 The National Archives of Malta is the central archive maintained by the Mediterranean island nation of Malta . The Archives has been housed in the Grandmaster 's Palace for most of its lifetime , having moved to three separate locations during the late 1980s . In 1988 , the Legal Documentation Section of the National Archives of Malta was opened , after records of court and tribunal hearings and decisions had been transferred to a Mdina facility beginning the previous year . A Gozo facility was opened soon after , and in 1994 , the then @-@ President of Malta , Ugo Mifsud Bonnici , officially opened the Archives ' new Rabat head office and main facility . All of the Archives ' locations feature a reading room , with facilities for researchers open to those over the age of sixteen who produce valid identification . 
 In recent years , the National Archives of Malta has been increasing its presence on the Internet , in line with many of its national archival counterparts throughout the world . This effort has included enabling members of the public to search the records of the Archives online , and view a short description of what is contained in the records found . Other efforts have included the digitising of a number of the Archives ' holdings , the release of many of the Archives ' publications on its web site , the sale of copies of the Archives ' holdings through its ' e @-@ shop ' , and an online presence for Malta 's National Memory Project , dedicated to <unk> the memories of those who have contributed to the history of Malta . 
 = = History = = 
 Efforts to establish a national archive began in 1971 , when a Committee on the Preservation of Public Records was established by Guze ’ Cassar <unk> . One year later , in 1972 , a section of Malta 's public records at Casa Leoni was opened up to the public and research facilities were provided for the public 's use . Initially under the oversight of Malta 's Ministry for Justice and Parliamentary Affairs , the Archives moved to the Grandmaster 's Palace , the home of the House of Representatives of Malta , within a few months . At that point , the government official in charge of the Archives was Michael Ellul . 
 In January 1986 , a governmental committee was established to discuss options for the management of Malta 's public records . It was decided that a stand @-@ alone National Archives of Malta would be established , to be headquartered in Rabat in a building that once housed a hospital . In addition , the Banca <unk> in Mdina was identified as suitable to house the records of Malta 's courts from the beginning of the occupation of Malta by the Knights Hospitaller to the early period of occupation by the United Kingdom . In September 1987 , the transfer of court records to the Mdina building began and was completed in October 1988 . The transfer of all other records to the Rabat facility was not completed until July 28 , 1989 , and the official opening of the building did not occur until May 28 , 1994 , when Ugo Mifsud Bonnici , the fifth President of Malta , presided over the opening . At that time , the officer in charge was Joe Caruana . 
 The first regulating Act for the National Archives of Malta was Act IV , passed in 1990 . Catalogues were published on CD @-@ ROM , an annual lecture was established and an exhibition centre was opened . In 2005 , Act V came into force , creating the post of National Archivist ( currently Charles J. <unk> ) and created the National Archives as a legal person under the Government of Malta 's umbrella . Since its opening , the National Archives have opened up three new facilities . 
 = = Facilities and services = = 
 The National Archives of Malta maintains three facilities across Malta . The first facility to be opened was the Legal Documentation Section , located in Mdina , which was opened in 1988 . This facility is located in an old bank building and houses court and tribunal records dating back to those decisions made under the Knights Hospitaller . The second facility is the Archives ' Gozo location , which holds over 9 @,@ 000 items . The final facility to be opened was the Head Office , located in Rabat , which was officially opened in 1994 . This facility houses most of Malta 's official records , and is the Archives ' main facility . 
 The National Archives of Malta offers services available to all residents of Malta , although many of its on @-@ site facilities are only open to residents over the age of sixteen years . The National Archives repositories contain reading rooms accessible to the public . Visitors are required to show identification to enter . The National Archives ' reading rooms contain a reference library , printed catalogues , photocopying facilities , an information desk featuring a number of publications and fact sheets and tools for preserving Malta 's records . Items stored in the archives may be accessed by members of the public by filling out a form . The records are then brought out to the <unk> 's table . In addition , the National Archives features a number of maps , plans and drawings of various public location in Malta , as well as photography work on royal celebrations and reconstruction work . 
 In addition , the National Archives of Malta offers a group and school visit program to increase public awareness of the records held there . Groups of 25 people or less may be taken through the Archives and shown what it has to offer , and school visits can be arranged in both the Archives ' Rabat and Mdina locations . School students are shown through the Archives to increase awareness of what they have to offer and also shown how archived documents are handled . Students are also given the chance to experience the difficulty involved in cataloging and reorganising the Archives ' items .

 The National Archives of Malta , like its counterparts in other areas of the world , has been moving to increase the availability of its services on the Internet . A number of items in its collection have been , or are in the process of being , digitised , and a catalogue listing search , along with a short description of each item , is available online on the Archives ' web site . The Archives releases many of its publications , including periodical newsletters , its annual report and the State of the Archives report , on its web site , and maintains an ' e @-@ shop ' to facilitate the sale of copies of some of its text and image holdings to interested members of the public . It is also possible to search the holdings of Malta 's National Memory Project , a memory of those who have contributed to the history of Malta , through the Archives ' web site . 
 = HMS Princess Royal ( 1911 ) = 
 HMS Princess Royal was the second of two Lion @-@ class battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy before World War I. Designed in response to the Moltke @-@ class battlecruisers of the Imperial German Navy , the ships significantly improved on the speed , armament , and armour of the preceding Indefatigable class . The ship was named for The Princess Royal , a title occasionally granted to the Monarch 's eldest daughter . 
 Laid down in 1912 and commissioned in 1913 , Princess Royal served in the Battle of Heligoland Bight a month after the war began . She was then sent to the Caribbean to prevent the German East Asia Squadron from using the Panama Canal . After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914 , Princess Royal rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron . During the Battle of Dogger Bank , Princess Royal scored only a few hits , although one crippled the German armoured cruiser Blücher . Shortly afterwards , she became the flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron , under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Osmond Brock . 
 Princess Royal was moderately damaged during the Battle of Jutland and required a month and a half of repairs . Apart from providing distant support during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917 , the ship spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols of the North Sea . Princess Royal was placed into reserve in 1920 , then was sold for breaking up as scrap in 1922 to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Lion @-@ class battlecruisers , nicknamed the " Splendid Cats " , were designed by Philip Watts , the Director of Naval Construction , to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the Moltke class as the German ships were to the Invincible class . The increase in speed , armour and gun size forced a 70 % increase in size over the Indefatigable class and made them the largest warships in the world . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Princess Royal was significantly larger than her predecessors . She had an overall length of 700 feet ( 213 @.@ 4 m ) , a beam of 88 feet 6 @.@ 75 inches ( 27 @.@ 0 m ) , and a draught of 32 feet 5 inches ( 9 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . The ship normally displaced 26 @,@ 270 long tons ( 26 @,@ 690 t ) and 30 @,@ 820 long tons ( 31 @,@ 310 t ) at deep load , over 8 @,@ 000 long tons ( 8 @,@ 100 t ) more than the earlier ships . She had a metacentric height of 5 @.@ 95 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) at deep load .

 Princess Royal had two paired sets of Parsons direct @-@ drive steam turbines housed in separate engine @-@ rooms . Each set consisted of a high @-@ pressure ahead @-@ and @-@ astern turbine driving an outboard shaft , and a low @-@ pressure ahead @-@ and @-@ astern turbine driving an inner shaft . Designed power was 70 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 52 @,@ 199 kW ) for a speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . In September 1912 , Princess Royal began her sea trials and developed 78 @,@ 803 shp ( 58 @,@ 763 kW ) for a speed of 28 @.@ 5 knots ( 52 @.@ 8 km / h ; 32 @.@ 8 mph ) . During maximum power trials in July 1913 , the battlecruiser achieved 96 @,@ 238 shp ( 71 @,@ 765 kW ) for a speed of 27 @.@ 97 knots ( 51 @.@ 80 km / h ; 32 @.@ 19 mph ) while at the unusually high displacement of 29 @,@ 660 long tons ( 30 @,@ 140 t ) . 
 The steam plant consisted of 42 Yarrow large @-@ tube boilers arranged in seven boiler rooms . Maximum bunkerage was 3 @,@ 500 long tons ( 3 @,@ 600 t ) of coal and an additional 1 @,@ 135 long tons ( 1 @,@ 153 t ) of fuel oil to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , the ship 's range was 5 @,@ 610 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 390 km ; 6 @,@ 460 mi ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Princess Royal was armed with eight BL 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk V guns ( " BL " for breech @-@ loading ) in four twin hydraulically powered turrets , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' Q ' and ' X ' from bow to stern . Her secondary armament consisted of 16 BL 4 @-@ inch Mk VII guns , most of which were mounted in casemates in the superstructure . The two guns mounted on the deck above the forward group of casemates were fitted with gun shields in 1913 and 1914 to better protect their crews from enemy fire . 
 The battlecruiser was built without anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns , but from October 1914 to December 1916 she was fitted with a single QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss gun ( " QF " for quick @-@ firing ) on a high @-@ angle mount , which had a maximum depression of 8 ° and a maximum elevation of 60 ° . Its 6 @-@ pound ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) shell was fired at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 765 ft / s ( 538 m / s ) and a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute . It had a maximum ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , but an effective range of only 3 @,@ 600 feet ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) . A single QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt AA gun was added in January 1915 and carried until April 1917 . Its high @-@ angle mount had a maximum depression of 10 ° and a maximum elevation of 90 ° . The gun fired a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ( 760 m / s ) at a rate of 12 to 14 rounds per minute . It had a maximum effective ceiling of 23 @,@ 500 ft ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) . 
 Princess Royal received a fire @-@ control director between mid @-@ 1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire @-@ control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns . To align their guns on the target , the turret crewmen had to follow pointers whose position was transmitted from the director . This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier for the director to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship 's roll as the turrets fired individually . 
 By early 1918 , Princess Royal carried a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter on flying @-@ off ramps fitted on top of ' Q ' and ' X ' turrets . The Pup was intended to shoot down Zeppelins while the 1 ½ Strutter was used for spotting and reconnaissance . Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather .

 The armour protection given to Lion and Princess Royal was heavier than on the Indefatigables . The waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick amidships ; this thinned to 4 inches towards the ships ' ends , and did not reach the bow or stern . The upper armour strake had a maximum thickness of 6 inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) abreast of the end turrets . The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by 8 to 9 inches ( 203 to 229 mm ) of armour , except for the turret roofs which used 2 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 25 inches ( 64 to 83 mm ) . The thickness of the nickel steel deck ranged from 1 to 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 25 to 64 mm ) . Nickel @-@ steel torpedo bulkheads 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick were fitted abreast of the magazines and shell rooms . The sides of the conning tower were 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick . After the Battle of Jutland revealed a vulnerability to plunging shellfire , 1 inch of additional armour , weighing approximately 100 long tons ( 102 t ) , was added to the magazine crowns and turret roofs .

 Princess Royal was laid down at the Vickers Shipyard in Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness on 2 May 1910 . She was launched on 29 April 1911 by Princess Louise , The Princess Royal , and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 14 November 1912 . She cost £ 1 @,@ 955 @,@ 922 plus an additional £ 120 @,@ 300 for her armament . Upon commissioning , Princess Royal joined the 1st Cruiser Squadron , which was renamed the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) in January 1913 . Rear @-@ Admiral Beatty assumed command of the 1st BCS on 1 March 1913 . The squadron , including Princess Royal , visited Brest in February 1914 and ports in Russia during June .

 = = = = Battle of Heligoland Bight = = = = 
 Princess Royal first saw combat during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914 . She was part of Admiral Beatty 's battlecruiser force , which was originally to provide distant support to the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast if the German High Seas Fleet sortied in response . The battlecruisers headed south at full speed at 11 : 35 a.m. when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule , as the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary . The British light cruiser Arethusa had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers Strassburg and Cöln when Beatty 's battlecruisers appeared out of the mist at 12 : 37 p.m. Strassburg was able to duck into the mists and evade fire , but Cöln was quickly crippled by the squadron 's guns . Before Cöln could be sunk , Beatty was distracted by the sudden appearance of the German light cruiser Ariadne directly to his front , and ordered pursuit . Ariadne was reduced to a burning hulk after only three salvos at less than 6 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) . 
 Princess Royal sailed from Cromarty on 28 September to rendezvous with a Canadian troop convoy bound for the United Kingdom . She rejoined the 1st BCS on 26 October , but was detached again a few days later to reinforce the North Atlantic and Caribbean Squadrons in the search for Admiral Graf Spee 's German East Asia Squadron after it destroyed the West Indies Squadron on 1 November 1914 . Princess Royal arrived at Halifax on 21 November , then spent several days off New York City before she steamed down to the Caribbean to guard against the possibility that Graf Spee would use the Panama Canal . The East Asia Squadron was sunk off the Falkland Islands on 7 December , and Princess Royal left Kingston , Jamaica to sail to the UK on 19 December . 
 = = = = Battle of Dogger Bank = = = = 
 On 23 January 1915 a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British vessels that might be collecting intelligence on German movements . The British were reading the German coded messages , and a large battlecruiser force under Admiral Beatty , aboard Lion , sailed to intercept . Contact was initiated at 7 : 20 a.m. on the 24th , when the British light cruiser Arethusa spotted the German light cruiser Kolberg . By 7 : 35 , the Germans had seen Beatty 's force ; Hipper , aboard Seydlitz , ordered his ships south at 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) , thinking that he could outpace any British battleships , and could increase to Blücher 's maximum speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) if the pursuing ships were battlecruisers . 
 Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to catch the Germans before they could escape . The leading ships , Lion , Princess Royal and Tiger , pursued at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) , and Lion opened fire at 8 : 52 at a range of 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) . The other ships followed a few minutes later but the extreme range and decreasing visibility meant they did not start scoring hits until 9 : 09 . The German battlecruisers opened fire two minutes later at a range of 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) and concentrated their fire on Lion , hitting her once . At 9 : 35 , Beatty signalled to " engage the corresponding ships in the enemy 's line " , but Tiger 's captain , believing that Indomitable was already engaging Blücher , fired at Seydlitz , as did Lion , which left Moltke unengaged and able to fire on Lion without risk . Moltke and Derfflinger combined their fire to badly damage Lion over the next hour , even with Princess Royal attacking Derfflinger . 
 Meanwhile , Blücher had been heavily damaged ; her speed had dropped to 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) , and her steering gear was jammed . Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her at 10 : 48 a.m. Six minutes later , he spotted what he thought was a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90 ° turn to port to avoid the submarine , although the submarine warning flag was not raised because most of Lion 's signal halyards had been shot away . Soon afterwards Lion lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water , which knocked out all remaining light and power . At 11 : 02 , Beatty had flags hoisted signalling " course north @-@ east " , to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper , and " attack the rear of the enemy " . Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Gordon Moore , temporarily commanding the squadron from New Zealand , thought that the signals meant to attack Blücher , which was about 8 @,@ 000 yards ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) to the north @-@ east , and ordered the four other battlecruisers away from the pursuit of Hipper 's main force to engage . Beatty tried to correct the mistake , but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read in the smoke and haze . 
 Beatty transferred to the destroyer Attack at 11 : 50 and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers , reaching them shortly before Blücher sank . He boarded Princess Royal at 12 : 20 p.m. and ordered the ships to pursue the main German force . This order was rescinded when it became clear that the time wasted in sinking Blücher meant the rest of Hipper 's battlecruisers would reach friendly waters before they could be caught . Beatty 's battlecruisers turned for home , catching up to Lion , which was limping along at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Princess Royal hit Derfflinger once , but only damaged two armour plates and caused a coal bunker to flood . She hit Blücher at least twice , including the shot that crippled her , out of a total of 271 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 343 mm ) shells fired during the battle , a hit rate of only 0 @.@ 7 % . By way of contrast , her sister Lion made four hits out of 243 shells fired , a rate of 1 @.@ 6 % . She also fired two 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch shrapnel shells at the German airship L5 as its crew attempted to bomb the sinking Blücher , mistaking it for a British ship , despite the fact that the maximum elevation of those guns was only 20 ° . Princess Royal was not damaged during the battle . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 On 31 May 1916 , Princess Royal was the flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Osmond Brock and the 1st BCS under Beatty 's overall command ; they had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea . The British had decoded the German radio messages , and left their bases before the Germans put to sea . Hipper 's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3 : 20 p.m. , but Beatty 's ships did not see the Germans to their east until 3 : 30 . Two minutes later , Beatty ordered a course change to east south @-@ east , positioning the British ships to cut off the Germans ' line of retreat , and signalled action stations . Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard , away from the British , to assume a south @-@ easterly course , and reduced speed to 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up . With this turn , Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet , 60 miles ( 97 km ) behind him . Beatty altered course to the east , as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off . 
 This began what was to be called the " Run to the South " as Beatty changed course to steer east south @-@ east at 3 : 45 , now paralleling Hipper 's course less than 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) away . The Germans opened fire first at 3 : 48 , followed by the British . The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships , Lion and Princess Royal , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire . The two battlecruisers engaged Lützow , the leading German ship , while Derfflinger targeted Princess Royal . The German fire was accurate from the start , with two hits on Princess Royal within the first three minutes . British gunnery was less effective ; the range was incorrectly estimated as the German ships blended into the haze . Princess Royal 's ' A ' turret stopped working effectively early in the battle : the left gun was rendered inoperable when the breech pinion gear sheared , and the right gun misfired frequently . By 3 : 54 , the range was down to 12 @,@ 900 yards ( 11 @,@ 800 m ) ; Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 3 : 57 . 
 At 4 : 11 p.m. a torpedo fired by Moltke passed under Princess Royal . Those aboard the British ship saw the torpedo 's track , but incorrectly concluded that a U @-@ boat was positioned on the opposite side of the British line ( away from the German battlecruisers ) and was firing towards both groups of ships . This false impression was compounded by reports of a periscope sighting by the destroyer HMS Landrail . By this time , the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire , so Beatty altered course four points to port between 4 : 12 and 4 : 15 , closing the range . This manoeuvre exposed Lion to the fire of the German battlecruisers , and the smoke from multiple successful hits caused Derfflinger to lose sight of Princess Royal and switch targets to Queen Mary at 4 : 16 . By 4 : 25 , the range was down to 14 @,@ 400 yards ( 13 @,@ 200 m ) and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again . Around this time , Queen Mary was hit multiple times in quick succession and her forward magazines exploded . At 4 : 30 , the light cruiser Southampton , scouting in front of Beatty 's ships , spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed . Three minutes later , they sighted the topmasts of Vice @-@ Admiral Reinhard Scheer 's battleships , but did not report this to the fleet for another five minutes . Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north . 
 The German battlecruisers made their own turn north in pursuit , but Beatty 's ships maintained full speed , and gradually moved out of range . The British battlecruisers turned north , then north @-@ east , to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet , and at 5 : 40 p.m. opened fire again on their German counterparts . Facing the setting sun , the Germans could not make out the British ships and turned away to the north @-@ east at 5 : 47 . Beatty gradually turned towards the east so his ships could cover the Grand Fleet as it deployed into battle formation , but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading British division to manoeuvre away from the Germans . About 6 : 22 , Princess Royal was hit by two 305 @-@ millimetre ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) shells fired by the battleship Markgraf ; one of these disabled ' X ' turret and the other penetrated the ship 's side armour . By 6 : 35 , Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were leading the Grand Fleet east @-@ southeast , and continuing to engage Hipper 's battlecruisers to their south @-@ west . A few minutes earlier , Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180 ° starboard turn , and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze . At 6 : 44 , Beatty turned his ships south @-@ east , then south @-@ southeast four minutes later , to find Hipper 's force . He then ordered the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand , while slowing to 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) and altering course to the south . Beatty then ordered his ships to make a complete circle to stay within visual range of the Grand Fleet . At 6 : 55 , Scheer ordered another 180 ° turn , which put the German ships on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet . However , the British had altered course to the south , allowing the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer 's " T " and inflict damage on the leading German ships . Scheer ordered yet another 180 ° turn at 7 : 13 , and successfully extricated the High Seas Fleet from the danger precipitated by his previous turn . About this time Princess Royal fired at the leading German battlecruiser for three minutes without result . 
 The British lost sight of the Germans until HMS Castor spotted smoke to the west @-@ northwest at 8 : 05 p.m. , then identified and engaged several German torpedo boats . Hearing the sound of gunfire , Beatty ordered his ships west , and spotted the German battlecruisers only 8 @,@ 500 yards ( 7 @,@ 800 m ) away . Inflexible opened fire at 8 : 20 , followed almost immediately by the rest of the battlecruisers . Shortly after 8 : 30 , the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of Rear @-@ Admiral Mauve 's II Battle Squadron were spotted . The British battlecruisers and German pre @-@ dreadnoughts exchanged fire ; the Germans only fired a few times before turning away to the west because of poor visibility and the more accurate British gunnery , and disappeared into the mist around 8 : 40 . Beatty 's battlecruisers sailed south @-@ southeast , ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet , until the order to reverse course for home was given at 2 : 55 a.m. 
 Along with the rest of the battlecruisers , Princess Royal reached Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland on the morning of 2 June , and she immediately received temporary repairs over the next eight days . She then sailed for Plymouth , where permanent repairs were completed on 15 July , and returned to Rosyth by 21 July . Princess Royal was hit nine times during the battle — six times by Derfflinger during the " Run to the South " , twice by Markgraf during the " Run to the North " , and once by Posen just after II Battle Squadron appeared — with 22 killed and 81 injured . The battlecruiser fired only 230 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch shells during the battle , as her visibility was often impaired by the funnel smoke and fires aboard Lion . She was credited with three hits on Lützow and two on Seydlitz . A torpedo fired at the German pre @-@ dreadnoughts failed to hit . 
 = = = = Post @-@ Jutland career = = = = 
 As the German High Seas Fleet was forbidden from taking any unnecessary risks , the majority of Princess Royal 's post @-@ Jutland activities consisted of uneventful patrols of the North Sea . On the evening of 18 August , the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet , minus the II Squadron , would be leaving harbour that night . The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on the 19th , with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines . The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and 6 battlecruisers to their anticipated rendezvous in the North Sea ; for fear that they had entered a minefield after HMS Nottingham was torpedoed , they turned north before turning south again . Scheer steered south @-@ eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship , which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt . Realising their mistake , the Germans then set course for home . The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark , and broke off . Both the British and German fleets returned home ; two British light cruisers , HMS Nottingham and Falmouth had been sunk by submarines , and the German dreadnought Westfalen had been damaged by a torpedo . 
 Princess Royal provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917 , but never came within range of any German ships . She sailed with the 1st BCS on 12 December after German destroyers sank a Norway @-@ bound convoy earlier that day , but the British were unable to intercept and returned to base the following day . Princess Royal , along with the rest of the Grand Fleet , sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway . However , the Germans were too far ahead of the British , and no shots were fired . Starting in July 1918 , the Grand Fleet was affected by the 1918 flu pandemic ; at one point , Princess Royal lacked sufficient healthy crewmen to sail . 
 Following the surrender of the High Seas Fleet at the end of the war , Princess Royal and the 1st BCS made up part of the guard force in Scapa Flow . Princess Royal was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919 . The battlecruiser was placed in reserve in 1920 , and an attempt to sell her to Chile later that year was unsuccessful . She became the flagship of the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Scottish Coast on 22 February 1922 . She was sold for scrap in December 1922 to meet the tonnage limitations set on the Royal Navy by the Washington Naval Treaty , and arrived at the breakers on 13 August 1923 .

 The Other Hand , also known as Little Bee , is a 2008 novel by British author Chris Cleave . It is a dual narrative story about a Nigerian asylum @-@ seeker and a British magazine editor , who meet during the oil conflict in the Niger Delta , and are re @-@ united in England several years later . Cleave , inspired as a university student by his temporary employment in an asylum detention centre , wrote the book in an attempt to humanise the plight of asylum @-@ seekers in Britain . The novel examines the treatment of refugees by the asylum system , as well as issues of British colonialism , globalization , political violence and personal accountability . 
 The novel was published by Sceptre , an imprint of Hodder & Stoughton . Sales were initially slow , but increased as a result of " word @-@ of @-@ mouth " publicity , with the book eventually ranking 13th on the 2009 Sunday Times bestseller list . It has also been ranked # 1 the " New York Times " bestseller list . The novel has received mixed reviews from critics . It has been praised for its focus on underlying human decency ; however , some reviewers felt its events were contrived . The two protagonists have been juxtaposed , with less sympathy evoked by Surrey @-@ born Sarah than Nigerian @-@ refugee Little Bee . The novel was nominated for the 2008 Costa Book Awards and a 2009 Commonwealth Writers ' Prize . A film adaptation is being developed , and will be produced by and star Nicole Kidman . 
 = = Background = = 
 Cleave spent his early childhood in West Africa , which he credits for having partially inspired The Other Hand . Further inspiration came from Cleaves 's temporary employment while studying experimental psychology at the University of Oxford . During the summer , Cleave painted underpasses , gardened and picked up litter , and hoped to use this experience to write a book . His final job was at <unk> House in Oxfordshire , an immigration detention centre . Cleave spent three days serving food to residents from war zones including Somalia , Eritrea and the Balkans . He explained : " I got talking with some of them and said why are you here ? Why are you in prison ? It 's not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places . It 's a text @-@ book definition of a concentration camp . The conditions are appalling . I was shocked enough for that to be the end of my light comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer . " Cleave believes he would not have written the novel were he not a parent , as he does not wish for his children " to grow up into a world that is callous and stupid . " 
 In 2005 , an incident inspired Cleave to write The Other Hand . Four years previously , in 2001 , an Angolan asylum @-@ seeker named Manuel Bravo had arrived in England with his 9 @-@ year @-@ old son . After being detained in an immigration centre for four years , officials decided to forcibly deport Bravo and his son back to Angola the next morning . During the night , Bravo committed suicide , aware that his son , who was still a minor , could not be deported unaccompanied . Cleave felt compelled to write about the " dirty secret " that is the British immigration system , and to do so in such a way as to showcase the " unexpected humour " of the refugees wherever possible , in order to make the book " an enjoyable and compelling read " for his audience . Cleave explained : 
 = = Plot = = 
 Using alternating first @-@ person perspectives , the novel tells the stories of Little Bee , a Nigerian refugee , and Sarah O 'Rourke ( née Summers ) , a magazine editor from Surrey . After spending two years detained in a British immigration detention centre , Little Bee is illegally released after a fellow refugee performs sexual favours for a detention officer . She travels to the home of Sarah and her husband Andrew , whom she met two years previously on a beach in the Niger Delta . Sarah is initially unaware of Little Bee 's presence , until Andrew , haunted by guilt of their shared past , commits suicide . Little Bee reveals herself to Sarah on the day of Andrew 's funeral , and helps her to care for her four @-@ year @-@ old son Charlie . 
 Through a mutual reflection on their past , it is revealed that Sarah and Andrew were on holiday at the time of their meeting with Little Bee . The trip was an attempt to salvage their marriage after Andrew discovered Sarah had been unfaithful to him , embarking on an affair with Home Office employee Lawrence Osborn . While walking on the beach one morning , they were approached by a then 14 @-@ year @-@ old Little Bee , and her older sister <unk> . The girls were being pursued by soldiers who had burned down their village and intended for there to be no witnesses left alive . The soldiers arrived and murdered a guard from the O <unk> ' hotel , but offered to spare the lives of the girls if Andrew would amputate his own middle finger with a machete . Afraid , and believing the soldiers would murder the girls anyway , Andrew refused , but Sarah complied in his place . The soldiers took both girls away , leaving the couple in doubt as to whether the soldiers would leave one girl alive in response , as they promised . 
 Little Bee explains that although <unk> was gang raped , murdered , and cannibalised by the soldiers , she was allowed to escape , and stowed away in the cargo hold of a ship bound for England . Sarah allows Little Bee to stay with her , intent on helping her become a legal British citizen . Lawrence , who is still involved with Sarah , disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning Little Bee in to the police . When he informs Little Bee that he is considering this , she responds that allowing her to stay would be what is best for Sarah , so if Lawrence turns her in , Little Bee will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair . The two reach an uneasy truce . After spending several days together , Sarah , Lawrence , Little Bee and Charlie take a trip to the park . Charlie goes missing , and Little Bee calls the police while Sarah searches for him . Although he is quickly found , the police become suspicious of Little Bee , and discover that she is in the country illegally . 
 Little Bee is detained and quickly deported back to Nigeria , where she believes she will be killed . Lawrence uses his Home Office connections to track Little Bee 's deportation details , and Sarah and Charlie are able to accompany her back home . Sarah believes that Little Bee will be safe as long as she is present , and together they begin collecting stories for a book Andrew had begun , and which Sarah intends to finish on his behalf , about the atrocities committed in the Nigerian oil conflict . During a trip to the same beach where they first encountered one another , soldiers arrive to take Little Bee away . Despite being captured , Little Bee is not dispirited , and instead is ultimately hopeful at the sight of Charlie playing happily with a group of Nigerian children . 
 = = Characters = = 
 The primary characters in The Other Hand are Little Bee , a Nigerian refugee , and Sarah , a middle @-@ class Englishwoman . Critics have focused on the contrast between the two , with Caroline Elkins of The New York Times commenting that Sarah might initially appear " insipid " to readers , and that when juxtaposed with Little Bee , she seems " unsympathetic , even tiresome " . Tim Teeman of The Times deemed Sarah " batty , bizarre and inconsistent , and despite the tragedy she has suffered , unsympathetic " , while writing that in contrast : " Goodness peppers every atom of [ Little Bee 's ] being . " Other reviewers took an opposite stance . Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle found Little Bee 's characterisation problematic , writing : " Sometimes she 's not convincing , and sometimes she tries too hard to convince . It 's too often apparent that Little Bee is not real . This doesn 't do justice to her story , and puts the burden back on the author to show that he 's representing her , rather than exploiting her . " Ed Lake of The Daily Telegraph felt that " Bee 's arch reasonableness and implausibly picturesque speech mean she often comes off as a too @-@ cute cipher " , and ultimately found Sarah the more convincing character . 
 The Guardian 's Lawrence Norfolk commented that Sarah is a " far from perfect heroine : a semi @-@ neglectful mother and unfaithful wife " , but noted that " Cleave does not mock Sarah ( and life in Kingston upon Thames ) any more than he does Little Bee and her experiences in Nigeria . " Norfolk felt that : " For all the characters ' faults , none of them is presented as inauthentic or standing for something that we are intended to disbelieve . On the disparity in sympathy for Sarah and Little Bee , Cleave assessed : " Sarah inevitably suffers by proximity to Little Bee , who is much easier to like . If Sarah is more twisted , I think it 's because her path through life has necessarily been more convoluted . Little Bee 's life is extremely harrowing but it is also very simple – she is swimming very hard against the current , struggling to survive and not to be swept away . Sarah doesn ’ t have the luxury of knowing in which direction she should swim . " 
 Steve <unk> of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch felt that Sarah and Little Bee are both " so richly drawn that the supporting characters suffer by comparison . " These supporting characters are Andrew , Sarah 's husband , Lawrence , her lover , Clarissa her colleague and Charlie , her four @-@ year @-@ old son , who for much of the novel answers only to " Batman " and dresses only in his Batman costume . Sarah Liss of CBC News deemed Andrew and Lawrence the two least @-@ likeable characters in the novel , describing Andrew as " an ordinary guy with self @-@ righteous beliefs who comes up slightly short when he 's tested by real life " and Lawrence as a " cowardly yes @-@ man " . Cleave agreed that for Lawrence , " career and propriety are more important than basic morality . He 's gone so far down that road that he can 't come back , and he 's made more villainous for all the things he could do but doesn 't . " Charlie is based on Cleave 's oldest son , who similarly spent six months aged four answering only to " Batman " . He forms the emotional centre of the novel , holding the adult characters together , and is a study in the early formation of identity . Cleave explained : " Little Bee is a novel about where our individuality lies – which layers of identity are us , and which are mere camouflage . So it 's a deliberate choice to use the metaphor of a child who is engaging in his first experiments with identity – in Charlie 's case by taking on the persona of a superhero . " 
 = = Themes = = 
 The Other Hand presents a critique of the British asylum system and attitude towards asylum @-@ seekers . Cleave feels there exists a " general lethargy " about the way asylum @-@ seekers are treated in Britain , and though he believes he is not a political writer , the book begins with an extract from a 2005 UK Home Office publication entitled " United Kingdom : A Journey to Citizenship " . The extract reads : " Britain is proud of its tradition of providing a safe haven for people fleeting ( sic ) persecution and conflict . " Cleave questioned : " If a government can 't even successfully proof @-@ read such a fundamental document , how seriously can we take its asylum procedure ? " In writing The Other Hand , Cleave hoped to " humanise " the issue for readers . Despite discussions of political violence and British Colonialism within the novel , Sarah L. Courteau , editor of the Wilson Quarterly commented : " You 're almost entirely unaware of its politics because the book doesn 't deal in abstractions but in human beings . " For this reason , she deemed The Other Hand " the best kind of political novel " . Emma Philip of The Courier @-@ Mail has opined that while The Other Hand does make political points , readers should not confuse it with a political book , as the " overwhelming beauty " of the relationship between Sarah , Little Bee and Charlie " far outweighs the political message . " 
 The novel also deals with the issue of globalisation . Courteau observed that although Little Bee learns English from newspapers she acquires at the English detention centre , her reference points are still Nigerian , and thus through her narrative voice Cleave " illustrates the forcible dislocations of a globalized world . " Cleave chose to explore the issue in The Other Hand as he believes that , although globalisation is frequently discussed , people rarely consider its meaning . He explained : " money can move freely across national borders , but people can 't . They 're actively prevented from going where the money is . Capital is global , but labour isn 't . I believe that 's the cause of two major crises that we 're involved in as a species – one is a financial crisis and one is a refugee crisis . Imagine a world where money can 't move , where capital is stuck in its country of origin , but people can freely move where the work is ! That 's an alternate interpretation of globalization that would solve a lot of problems . " Although Cleave did not intend for the novel to be heavily political , he felt it was important to raise the issue , given the refugee subject matter of The Other Hand . 
 Marital infidelity features throughout the sections of the novel narrated by Sarah . Cleave discussed : " When you are choosing a lover , you 're choosing a philosophy ; it 's not about sex , it 's not about marriage . With Sarah , her unfaithfulness is just one of the symptoms of the fact that she 's torn and is going to have to make this strong moral choice . " Sarah 's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew 's suicide . Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel , with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on " postcolonial guilt or African angst " , Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers ' conceptions of civility and ethical choice . Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti @-@ complacency , however believes that is does so by " bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third . " She deemed The Other Hand essentially a novel about " the borders we draw , and the real damage they inflict " . 
 = = Style = = 
 Having spent almost two years working on the novel , Cleave decided upon using the dual narrative , as : " This is a story of two worlds : the developed and the developing , and of the mutual incomprehension that sometimes dooms them to antagonism . " He found it technically challenging to write from a female perspective , but felt that it prevented him from unwittingly using his own voice to animate the characters , explaining : " It forces me to listen , to think , and to write more precisely . " Kaminski accused Cleave of cultural appropriation , asking rhetorically : " When a white male author writes as a young Nigerian girl , is it an act of empathy , or identity theft ? " Cleave has responded by stating that he sympathises with those who feel he has no right to write from the perspective of a Nigerian girl , but feels that he does it well . He believes that the best mechanism for telling a story about crossing borderlines is to depict both sides . He conducted interviews with actual asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , a psychiatrist specialising in the trauma of child refugees , and members of London 's Nigerian community , researching speech patterns to shape the " quirks and cadences " of Little Bee 's narrative voice . 
 A central stylistic feature of the novel is the lack of detail Cleave gives regarding elements of Little Bee 's past . " Little Bee " is an assumed name , described as a " mechanism for survival " by Courteau , as the character is forced to discard her true name when pursued by soldiers , through fear it may reveal her tribe and religion . Her real name , Udo , is not revealed until the end of the novel . Courteau also highlights the fact that Little Bee 's Nigerian enemies and their motivations are never explicitly described , as the novel is told through the first @-@ person narrative , and Little Bee herself is limited in her understanding of them . Cleave intended for the story as a whole never to be fully explicit , relying instead on readers ' interpretation of the characters ' dialogue . 
 Throughout the novel , Little Bee considers how she would explain England to " the girls back home " in Nigeria . Cleave uses the girls as a Greek chorus , providing a foil to allow the cultural dissonance experienced by Little Bee to be made explicit . He feels the device is more natural than having Little Bee narrate her alarm first hand , allowing the reader to appreciate the cultural gulf , and Little Bee to seem knowing as opposed to tragic . Through Little Bee 's narration , Cleave examines human culture from the opposite perspective as science fiction does , having an extraordinary protagonist explore an ordinary world . This contemporary realism gives a significance to mundane events experienced by Little Bee , while bringing into focus " sad and ignoble " aspects of English culture such as the detention system . Cleave commented : " We have become accustomed to viewing our own actions in soft focus , but the alien narrator has not yet acquired this cultural immunity . She sees us as we can no longer see ourselves . " 
 Courteau compared The Other Hand to Ian McEwan 's Enduring Love observing that both novels are formed around " a single horrific encounter " , and praised Cleave for his " restrained , diamond @-@ hard prose " . Philip drew a different comparison , opining that Cleave 's writing style — using plain language to describe atrocities — was reminiscent of John Boyne 's The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas .

 The novel was first published on 7 August 2008 , released in hardback by Sceptre in the UK . The hardback edition sold just 3 @,@ 000 copies in 2008 , however the publication of a paperback copy , released on 5 February 2009 , saw increased sales , with 100 @,@ 000 paperback copies sold in Britain in March and April 2009 , despite no advertising and little marketing for the novel . As of November 2009 , 300 @,@ 000 copies of the novel had been sold . Richard Brooks of The Times attributed its success to recommendations from readers to family and friends , with Cleave calling it " an example of word @-@ of @-@ mouth success . " The novel was published in America and Canada by Simon & Schuster under the alternative title Little Bee . It was released in hardback and eBook format in February 2009 , and in paperback in February 2010 . Cleave likes both titles , believing that The Other Hand " speaks to the dichotomous nature of the novel , with its two narrators and two worlds " , also referencing Sarah 's injury , while Little Bee is appropriate as the novel is really the telling of Little Bee 's story , and sounds " bright and approachable " , in line with his aim to write " an accessible story about a serious subject .

 Mirroring the deliberately vague detail within the novel , the blurb on the book is unusually written , in that it does not name the characters or reveal the plot . It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner , and has the approval of Cleave , who described it as " genius " . Cleave explained : " I think readers are quite smart and don 't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary . It 's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed . And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually . " The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel , but both begin : " We don 't want to tell you too much about this book . It is a truly special story and we don 't want to spoil it . " and end : " Once you have read it , you 'll want to tell everyone about it . When you do , please don 't tell them what happens either . The magic is in how it unfolds . " James Spackman , Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre , was initially sceptical of the blurb , particularly disliking the use of " we " for the publisher to address the reader directly . Once the book became a best @-@ seller , however , he revised his stance , and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information , with an unusual format and " arrestingly direct " tone . The blurb won Sceptre the " Best <unk> " award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards .

 The Other Hand reached number 13 on the 2009 Sunday Times bestseller list , and was the only literary title on the list without a Richard and Judy Book Club recommendation , a literary award or a film adaptation . It also topped The New York Times Best Seller list for paperback trade fiction in 2010 . The novel was nominated at the 2008 Costa Book Awards , though lost to The Secret Scripture by Sebastian Barry . It was nominated for the 2009 Commonwealth Writers ' Prize as the best book originating from Europe and South Asia , but lost to <unk> Earth by <unk> Lahiri . In 2010 , The Other Hand was longlisted for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award , nominated by Cleveland Public Library , Seattle Public Library and Dunedin Public Libraries , New Zealand . 
 The book has received mixed reviews . Some critics have praised the novel for its focus on underlying human decency . The New York Times 's Caroline Elkins felt that the pretext of the novel " initially feels contrived " , but assessed that " in a world full of turpitude and injustice , it is [ Sarah and Little Bee 's ] bold , impulsive choices that challenge the inevitability of despair , transforming a political novel into an affecting story of human triumph . " James Urquhart of The Independent called the book " a powerful piece of art " , writing : " Besides sharp , witty dialogue , an emotionally charged plot and the vivid characters ' ethical struggles , The Other Hand delivers a timely challenge to reinvigorate our notions of civilised decency " . Equally , Andrew Rosenheim of Publishers Weekly found the book noteworthy for Cleave 's " ability to find a redemptive grace in the midst of almost inconceivable horror . " while Jeremy Jehu of The Daily Telegraph deemed it an " elegant parable " and a " challenge to every cosy , knee @-@ jerk liberal inclined to spout off about our shared humanity and global obligations . " 
 A separate Daily Telegraph review , this by critic Ed Lake , took a dissimilar stance , opining that that book is " pervaded by a vaguely distasteful glossiness " , and that " if Cleave is writing from great depths of feeling , he hides it well . " Lake deemed the book " faultlessly relevant , but ultimately cloying . " Another Publishers Weekly review was also less positive , calling the book " beautifully staged " but " haphazardly plotted " , and noting : " Cleave has a sharp cinematic eye , but the plot is undermined by weak motivations and coincidences . " Teeman of The Times felt that the book was overwritten , and wished " <unk> " that it had a less positive conclusion , commenting : " With every motive and action explicitly drawn , fleshed out and explained , there is no room for mystery , ambiguity or even tension .

Kidman had already read the novel before Mutrux contacted her about producing the film , on a flight between Los Angeles and Australia . The Times reported that she was " so eager " to play Sarah that she personally competed with several film studios in order to secure the rights to the book . 
 = Divine command theory = 
 Divine command theory ( also known as theological voluntarism ) is a meta @-@ ethical theory which proposes that an action 's status as morally good is equivalent to whether it is commanded by God . The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands , and that for a person to be moral is to follow his commands . Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God 's commands in establishing morality . Numerous variants of the theory have been presented : historically , figures including Saint Augustine , Duns Scotus , and Thomas Aquinas have presented various versions of divine command theory ; more recently , Robert Merrihew Adams has proposed a " modified divine command theory " based on the omnibenevolence of God in which morality is linked to human conceptions of right and wrong . Paul <unk> has argued in favour of the theory from a Christian viewpoint , and Linda Zagzebski 's divine motivation theory proposes that God 's motivations , rather than commands , are the source of morality . 
 Semantic challenges to divine command theory have been proposed ; the philosopher William Wainwright argued that to be commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning , which he believed would make defining obligation difficult . He also contended that , as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory , atheists and agnostics could not be moral ; he saw this as a weakness of the theory . Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that , even if God 's command and morality correlate in this world , they may not do so in other possible worlds . In addition , the Euthyphro dilemma , first proposed by Plato , presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God , or challenge his omnipotence . Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God , moral autonomy and religious pluralism , although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges . 
 = = General form = = 
 Various forms of divine command theory have been presented in the past by philosophers including William of Ockham , St Augustine , Duns Scotus , and John Calvin . The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands . Stronger versions of the theory assert that God 's command is the only reason that a good action is moral , while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason . The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result of their being commanded by God , and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory . Because of these premises , adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God 's commands ; what is morally right is what God desires . 
 = = = Augustine = = = 
 Saint Augustine offered a version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as the pursuit of the supreme good , which delivers human happiness . He argued that to achieve this happiness , humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner ; this requires humans to love God , which then allows them to correctly love everything else . Augustine 's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves , leading to human happiness and fulfilment . Augustine supported Plato 's view that a well @-@ ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality ; unlike Plato , he believed that achieving a well @-@ ordered soul had a higher purpose : living in accordance with God 's commands . His view of morality was thus <unk> , as he believed in deference to a higher authority ( God ) , rather than acting autonomously . 
 = = = Scholasticism = = = 
 Scholastic philosopher John Duns Scotus argued that the only moral obligations that God could not take away from humans are to love one another and love God . He proposed that some commandments are moral because God commands them , and some are moral irrespective of his command . Duns Scotus argued that the natural law contains only what is self @-@ evidently analytically true and that God could not make these statements false . This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God 's will ; these commands were those found on the first tablet of the Ten Commandments – the first three , which consist of obligations to God . He suggested that the rest of the Ten Commandments , and any other commandments God makes , are morally obligatory because God commands them . 
 Kelly James Clark and Anne <unk> have presented a defence of divine command theory based on Aquinas ' moral theory . Aquinas proposed a theory of natural law which asserted that something is moral if it works towards the purpose of human existence , and so human nature can determine what is moral . Clark and <unk> argued that God created human nature and thus commanded a certain morality ; hence he cannot arbitrarily change what is right or wrong for humans . 
 = = = Immanuel Kant = = = 
 The deontological ethics of Immanuel Kant has been cast as rejecting divine command theory by several figures , among whom is ethicist R. M. Hare . Kant 's view that morality should be determined by the categorical imperative – duty to the moral law , rather than acting for a specific end – has been viewed as incompatible with divine command theory . Philosopher and theologian John E. Hare has noted that some philosophers see divine command theory as an example of Kant 's <unk> will – motives besides the moral law , which Kant regarded as non @-@ moral . American philosopher Lewis White Beck takes Kant 's argument to be a refutation of the theory that morality depends of divine authority . John E. Hare challenges this view , arguing that Kantian ethics should be seen as compatible with divine command theory . 
 = = = Robert Adams = = = 
 American philosopher Robert Merrihew Adams proposes what he calls a " modified divine command theory " . Adams presents the basic form of his theory by asserting that two statements are equivalent : 
 It is wrong to do X. 
 It is contrary to God 's commands to do X. 
 He proposes that God 's commands <unk> moral truths and must be explained in terms of moral truths , not the other way around . Adams writes that his theory is an attempt to define what being ethically ' wrong ' consists of and accepts that it is only useful to those within a Judeo @-@ Christian context . In dealing with the criticism that a seemingly immoral act would be obligatory if God commanded it , he proposes that God does not command cruelty for its own sake . Adams does not propose that it would be logically impossible for God to command cruelty , rather that it would be unthinkable for him to do so because of his nature . Adams emphasises the importance of faith in God , specifically faith in God 's goodness , as well as his existence . 
 Adams proposes that an action is morally wrong if and only if it defies the commands of a loving God . If cruelty was commanded , he would not be loving ; Adams argued that , in this instance , God 's commands would not have to be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down . He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God 's commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case . Adams ' theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary , as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God , but are founded on his omnibenevolence . It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law . 
 Adams proposes that in many Judeo @-@ Christian contexts , the term ' wrong ' is used to mean being contrary to God 's commands . In ethical contexts , he believes that ' wrong ' entails an emotional attitude against an action and that these two uses of wrongness usually correlate . Adams suggests that a believer 's concept of morality is founded in their religious belief and that right and wrong are tied to their belief in God ; this works because God always commands what believers accept to be right . If God commanded what a believer perceived as wrong , the believer would not say it is right or wrong to disobey him ; rather their concept of morality would break down . 
 Michael Austin writes that an implication of this modified divine command theory is that God cannot command cruelty for its own sake ; this could be argued to be inconsistent with God 's omnipotence . Thomas Aquinas argued that God 's omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are possible : he attempted to refute the idea that God 's inability to perform illogical actions challenges his omnipotence . Austin contends that commanding cruelty for its own sake is not illogical , so is not covered by Aquinas ' defence , although Aquinas had argued that sin is the falling short of a perfect action and thus not compatible with omnipotence . 
 = = = Alternative theories = = = 
 Paul <unk> argues from a Christian viewpoint that man , made in God 's image , conforms to God 's sense of morality . The description of actions as right or wrong are therefore relevant to God ; a person 's sense of what is right or wrong corresponds to God 's . 
 We would not know goodness without God 's endowing us with a moral constitution . We have rights , dignity , freedom , and responsibility because God has designed us this way . In this , we reflect God 's moral goodness as His image @-@ bearers . 
 As an alternative to divine command theory , Linda Zagzebski has proposed divine motivation theory , which stills fits into a monotheistic framework . According to this theory , goodness is determined by God 's motives , rather than by what he commands . Divine motivation theory is similar to virtue ethics because it considers the character of an agent , and whether they are in accordance with God 's , as the standard for moral value . Zagzebski argues that things in the world have objective moral properties , such as being lovable , which are given to them through God 's perception of them . God 's attitude towards something is cast as a morally good attitude . The theory casts God as a good example for morality , and humans should imitate his virtues as much as is possible for finite , imperfect beings . 
 = = Objections = = 
 = = = Semantic objections = = = 
 Philosopher William Wainwright considered a challenge to the theory on semantic grounds , arguing that " being commanded by God " and " being obligatory " do not mean the same thing , contrary to what the theory suggests . He used the example of water not having an identical meaning to H2O to propose that " being commanded by God " does not have an identical meaning to " being obligatory " . This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory , but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation . Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God ; Edward Wierenga argued that , if this is the case , the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge . Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on modal ideas of what might exist in different worlds . He suggested that , even if one accepts that being commanded by God and being morally right are the same , they may not be synonyms because they might be different in other possible worlds . 
 = = = Moral motivation = = = 
 Michael Austin has noted that divine command theory could be criticised for prompting people to be moral with impure motivations . He writes of the objection that a moral life should be sought because morality is valued , rather than to avoid punishment or receive a reward . This punishment and reward system of motivation could be seen as inadequate . 
 = = = Euthyphro dilemma = = = 
 The Euthyphro dilemma was proposed in Plato 's dialogue between Socrates and Euthyphro . In the scene , Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety when Socrates presents the dilemma , which can be presented as the question ' Is X good because God commands it , or does God command X because it is good ? ' 
 Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious , or is it pious because it is loved by the gods ? 
 The Euthyphro dilemma can elicit the response that an action is good because God commands the action , or that God commands an action because it is good . If the first is chosen , it would imply that whatever God commands must be good : even if he commanded someone to inflict suffering , then inflicting suffering must be moral . If the latter is chosen , then morality is no longer dependent on God , defeating the divine command theory . Additionally , if God is subject to an external law , he is not sovereign or omnipotent , which would challenge the orthodox conception of God . Proponents of the Euthyphro dilemma might claim that divine command theory is obviously wrong because either answer challenges the ability of God to give moral laws . 
 William of Ockham responded to the Euthyphro Dilemma by ' biting the bullet ' . He argued that , if God did command people to be cruel , then that would be morally obligatory , proposing that the only limitation to what God can make obligatory is the principle of non @-@ contradiction . Robert Adams defended Ockham 's view , noting that it is only a logical possibility that God would command what we consider to be immoral , not an actuality . Even if God could logically command these actions , he would not because that is not his character . Eleonore Stump and Norman <unk> have responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by appealing to the doctrine of divine simplicity , a concept associated with Aquinas and Aristotle which suggests that the substance and attributes of God are identical . They propose that God and goodness are identical and that this is what makes his commands good . 
 American philosopher William Alston responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by considering what it means for God to be morally good . If divine command theory is accepted , it implies that God is good because he obeys his own commands ; Alston argued that this is not the case and that God 's goodness is distinct from abiding by moral obligations . He suggested that a moral obligation implies that there is some possibility that the agent may not honour their obligation ; Alston argued that this possibility does not exist for God , so his morality must be distinct from simply obeying his own commands . Alston contended that God is the supreme standard of morality and acts according to his character , which is necessarily good . There is no more arbitrariness in this view than accepting another moral standard . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Leibniz , and some more recent philosophers , challenged the theory because it seems to entail that God 's goodness consists of his following his own commands . It is argued that , if divine command theory is accepted , God 's obligations would be what he commanded himself to do ; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent . Neither could God hold any virtues , as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands – if he cannot logically command himself , then he cannot logically have any virtues . Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good , but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy . William Wainwright argues that , although God does not act because of his commands , it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions . He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and , when he commands what is morally good , it becomes morally obligatory . 
 = = = Autonomy = = = 
 Michael Austin draws attention to an objection from autonomy , which argues that morality requires an agent to freely choose which principles they live by . This challenges the view of divine command theory that God 's will determines what is good because humans are no longer autonomous , but followers of an imposed moral law , making autonomy incompatible with divine command theory . Robert Adams challenges this criticism , arguing that humans must still choose to accept or reject God 's commands and rely on their independent judgement about whether or not to follow them . 
 = = = Pluralism = = = 
 Austin considers the view that , in a world of religious pluralism , it is impossible to know which god 's or religion 's commands should be followed , especially because some religions contradict others , leaving it impossible to accept all of them . Within religions there are also various interpretations of what is commanded . Austin notes that some of the responses to the autonomy objection may be relevant , as an agent must choose whichever religion and morality they judge to be correct . He argues that divine command theory is also consistent with the view that moral truths can be found in all religions and that moral revelation can be found apart from religion . <unk> Geirsson and Margaret Holmgren argue against the view that different religions can lead to the same God because some religions are incompatible with each other ( monotheistic and polytheistic religions have contrasting views of divinity , for example , and some Greek or Nordic gods magnified human weaknesses ) . They argue that determining which god should be listened to remains a problem and that , even within a religion , contrasting views of God exist – the commands of God in the Old and New Testaments could seem to contradict each other . 
 = = Divine command theory in religion = = 
 Divine command theory features in the ethics of many modern religions , including Judaism , Islam , the Bahá 'í Faith , and Christianity , as well as being a part of numerous older polytheistic religions . In ancient Athens , it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands , and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality . Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory , it is commonly associated with it . It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths . The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all @-@ powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths , rather than moral truths existing independently of him , which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence . 
 = Sunbeam Tiger = 
 The Sunbeam Tiger is a high @-@ performance V8 version of the British Rootes Group 's Sunbeam Alpine roadster , designed in part by American car designer and racing driver Carroll Shelby and produced from 1964 until 1967 . Shelby had carried out a similar V8 conversion on the AC Cobra , and hoped to be offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America . Rootes decided instead to contract the assembly work to Jensen at West Bromwich in England , and pay Shelby a royalty on every car produced . 
 Two major versions of the Tiger were built : the Mark I ( 1964 – 67 ) was fitted with the 260 cu in ( 4 @.@ 3 L ) Ford V8 ; the Mark II , of which only 633 were built in the final year of Tiger production , was fitted with the larger Ford 289 cu in ( 4 @.@ 7 L ) engine . Two prototype and extensively modified versions of the Mark I competed in the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans , but neither completed the race . Rootes also entered the Tiger in European rallies with some success , and for two years it was the American Hot Rod Association 's national record holder over a quarter @-@ mile drag strip . 
 Production ended in 1967 soon after the Rootes Group was taken over by Chrysler , which did not have a suitable engine to replace the Ford V8 . Owing to the ease and affordability of modifying the Tiger , there are few surviving cars in standard form . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Sunbeam Tiger was a development of the Sunbeam Alpine series I , introduced by the British manufacturer Rootes in 1959 . Rootes realised that the Alpine needed more power if it was to compete successfully in world markets , but lacked a suitable engine and the resources to develop one . The company therefore approached Ferrari to redesign the standard inline @-@ four cylinder engine , recognising the sales cachet that " powered by Ferrari " would be likely to bring . Negotiations initially seemed to go well , but ultimately broke down . 
 In 1962 racing driver and Formula 1 champion Jack Brabham proposed to Rootes competition manager Norman Garrad the idea of fitting the Alpine with a Ford V8 engine , which Garrad relayed to his son Ian , then the West Coast Sales Manager of Rootes American Motors Inc . Ian Garrad lived close to where Carroll Shelby had his Shelby American operation , which had done a similar V8 conversion for the British AC Cobra . 
 = = Initial prototypes = = 
 According to journalist William Carroll , after measuring the Alpine 's engine bay with " a ' precision ' instrument of questionable antecedents " – a wooden yardstick – Ian Garrad despatched his service manager Walter McKenzie to visit the local new car dealerships , looking for a V8 engine that might fit . McKenzie returned with the news that the Ford 260 V8 engine appeared to be suitable , which apart from its size advantage was relatively light at 440 lb ( 200 kg ) . Ian Garrad asked Shelby for an idea of the timescale and cost to build a prototype , which Shelby estimated to be eight weeks and $ 10 @,@ 000 . He then approached Brian Rootes , head of sales for the Rootes Group , for funding and authorisation to build a prototype , to which Brian Rootes agreed . 
 Ian Garrad , impatient to establish whether the conversion was feasible , commissioned racing driver and fabricator Ken Miles to build another prototype as quickly as he could . Miles was provided with a budget of $ 800 , a Series II Alpine , a Ford V8 engine and a 2 @-@ speed automatic transmission , and in about a week he had a running V8 conversion , thus proving the concept . 
 Shelby began work on his prototype , the white car as it came to be known , in April 1963 , and by the end of the month it was ready for trial runs around Los Angeles . Ian Garrad and John <unk> , director of Rootes Motors Inc. of North America , tested an early version of the car and were so impressed that <unk> wrote a glowing report to Brian Rootes : " we have a tremendously exciting sports car which handles extremely well and has a performance equivalent to an XX @-@ K Jaguar ... it is quite apparent that we have a most successful experiment that can now be developed into a production car . " 
 Provisionally known as the Thunderbolt , the Shelby prototype was more polished than the Miles version , and used a Ford 4 @-@ speed manual transmission . The Ford V8 was only 3 @.@ 5 inches longer than the Alpine 's 4 @-@ cylinder engine it replaced , so the primary concern was the engine 's width . Like Miles , Shelby found that the Ford V8 would only just fit into the Alpine engine bay : " I think that if the figure of speech about the shoehorn ever applied to anything , it surely did to the tight squeak in getting that 260 Ford mill into the Sunbeam engine compartment . There was a place for everything and a space for everything , but positively not an inch to spare . " 
 = = Development = = 
 All Rootes products had to be approved by Lord Rootes , who was reportedly " very grumpy " when he learned of the work that had gone into the Tiger project without his knowledge . But he agreed to have the Shelby prototype shipped over from America in July 1963 for him and his team to assess . He insisted on driving the car himself , and was so impressed that shortly after returning from his test drive he contacted Henry Ford II directly to negotiate a deal for the supply of Ford V8 engines . Rootes placed an initial order for 3000 , the number of Tigers it expected to sell in the first year , the largest single order Ford had ever received for its engines from an automobile manufacturer . Not only did Lord Rootes agree that the car would go into production , but he decided that it should be launched at the 1964 New York Motor Show , only eight months away , despite the company 's normal development cycle from " good idea " to delivery of the final product being three to four years . 
 Installing such a large engine in a relatively small vehicle required some modifications , although the exterior sheet metal remained essentially the same as the Alpine 's . Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating ball steering mechanism to a more modern rack and pinion system . 
 Although twice as powerful as the Alpine , the Tiger is only about twenty per cent heavier , but the extra weight of the larger engine required some minor suspension modifications . Nevertheless , the Tiger 's front @-@ to @-@ back weight ratio is substantially similar to the Alpine 's , at 51 @.@ 7 / 48 @.@ 3 front / rear . 
 Shortly before its public unveiling at the New York Motor Show in April 1964 the car was renamed from Thunderbolt to Tiger , inspired by Sunbeam 's 1925 land @-@ speed @-@ record holder . 
 = = Production = = 
 Shelby had hoped to be given the contract to produce the Tiger in America , but Rootes was somewhat uneasy about the closeness of his relationship with Ford , so it was decided to build the car in England . The Rootes factory at Ryton did not have the capacity to build the Tiger , so the company contracted the job to Jensen in West Bromwich . Any disappointment Shelby may have felt was tempered by an offer from Rootes to pay him an undisclosed royalty on every Tiger built . 
 Jensen was able to take on production of the Tiger because its assembly contract for the Volvo <unk> had recently been cancelled . An additional factor in the decision was that Jensen 's chief engineer Kevin Beattie and his assistant Mike Jones had previously worked for Rootes , and understood how the company operated . The first of 14 Jensen @-@ built prototypes were based on the Series IV body shell , which became available at the end of 1963 . 
 The Tiger went into production in June 1964 , little more than a year after the completion of the Shelby prototype . Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by Pressed Steel in Oxfordshire , and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America . Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods , including using a sledgehammer to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place . Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month , which were initially offered for sale only in North America . The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg @-@ Warner 4 @-@ speed all @-@ <unk> manual gearbox , until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang . 
 Several performance modifications were available from dealers . The original 260 CID engine was considered only mildly tuned at 164 hp ( 122 kW ) , and some dealers offered modified versions with up to 245 hp ( 183 kW ) for an additional $ 250 . These modifications were particularly noticeable to the driver above 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) , although they proved problematic for the standard suspension and tyres , which were perfectly tuned for the stock engine . A 1965 report in the British magazine Motor Sport concluded that " No combination of an American V8 and a British chassis could be happier . "

 Production reached <unk> cars over three distinct series . The factory only ever designated two , the Mark I and Mark II , but as the official Mark I production spanned the change in body style from the Series IV Alpine panels to the Series V panels , the later Mark I cars are generally designated Mark IA by Sunbeam Tiger enthusiasts . The Mark II Tiger , fitted with the larger Ford 289 cu in ( 4 @.@ 7 L ) , was intended exclusively for export to America and was never marketed in the UK , although six right @-@ hand drive models were sold to the Metropolitan Police for use in traffic patrols and high @-@ speed pursuits ; four more went to the owners of important Rootes dealerships . 
 All Tigers were fitted with a single Ford twin @-@ choke carburettor . The compression ratio of the larger Mark II engine was increased from the 8 @.@ 8 : 1 of the smaller block to 9 @.@ 3 : 1 . Other differences between the versions included upgraded valve springs ( the 260 had developed a reputation for self @-@ destructing if pushed beyond 5000 rpm ) , an engine @-@ oil cooler , an alternator instead of a dynamo , a larger single dry plate hydraulically operated clutch , wider ratio transmission , and some rear @-@ axle modifications . There were also cosmetic changes : speed stripes instead of chrome strips down the side of the car , a modified radiator grille , and removal of the headlamp cowls . All Tigers were fitted with the same 4 @.@ 5 in ( 110 mm ) wide steel disc bolt @-@ on wheels as the Alpine IV , and Dunlop RS5 4 @.@ 90 in × 13 in ( 124 mm × 330 mm ) cross @-@ ply tyres . The lack of space in the Tiger 's engine bay causes a few maintenance problems ; the left bank of spark plugs is only accessible through a hole in the bulkhead for instance , normally sealed with a rubber bung , and the oil filter had to be relocated from the lower left on the block to a higher position on the right @-@ hand side , behind the generator .

 The Ford V8 as fitted to the Tiger produced 164 bhp ( 122 kW ) @ 4400 rpm , sufficient to give the car a 0 – 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) time of 8 @.@ 6 seconds and a top speed of 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) . 
 The Girling @-@ manufactured brakes used 9 @.@ 85 in ( 250 mm ) discs at the front and 9 in ( 229 mm ) drums at the rear . The suspension was independent at the front , using coil springs , and at the rear had a live axle and semi @-@ elliptic springs . Apart from the addition of a Panhard rod to better locate the rear axle , and stiffer front springs to cope with the weight of the V8 engine , the Tiger 's suspension and braking systems are identical to that of the standard Alpine . The fitting points for the Panhard rod interfered with the upright spare wheel in the boot , which was repositioned to lie horizontally beneath a false floor ; the battery was moved from beneath the rear seat to the boot at the same time . The kerb weight of the car increased from the 2 @,@ 220 lb ( 1 @,@ 010 kg ) of the standard Alpine to 2 @,@ 653 lb ( 1 @,@ 203 kg ) . 
 In 1964 , its first year of production , all but 56 of the 1649 Mark I Tigers assembled were shipped to North America , where it was priced at $ <unk> . In an effort to increase its marketability to American buyers the car was fitted with " Powered by Ford 260 " badges on each front wing beneath the Tiger logo . The Mark I was unavailable in the UK until March 1965 , when it was priced at £ 1446 . It was also sold in South Africa for <unk> , badged as the Sunbeam Alpine 260 .

 Priced at $ <unk> , the Mark II Tiger was little more than a re @-@ engined Mark IA ; by comparison , a contemporary V8 Ford Mustang sold for $ <unk> . The larger 289 cu in ( 4 @.@ 7 L ) Ford engine improved the Tiger 's 0 – 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) time to 7 @.@ 5 seconds , and increased the top speed to 122 mph ( 196 km / h ) . Officially the Mark II Tiger was only available in the US , where it was called the Tiger II . By the time the Mark II car went into production Chrysler was firmly in charge of Rootes , and the " Powered by Ford " shields were replaced by " Sunbeam V @-@ 8 " badges .

 Rootes had always been insufficiently capitalised , and losses resulting from a damaging thirteen @-@ week strike at one of its subsidiaries , British & Light Steel <unk> , coupled with the expense of launching the Hillman Imp , meant that by 1964 the company was in serious financial difficulties . At the same time , Chrysler was looking to boost its presence in Europe , and so a deal was struck in June 1964 in which Chrysler paid £ 12 @.@ 3 million ( $ 34 @.@ 44 million ) for a large stake in Rootes , although not a controlling one . As part of the agreement Chrysler committed not to acquire a majority of Rootes voting shares without the approval of the UK government , which was keen not to see any further American ownership of the UK motor industry . In 1967 Minister of Technology Anthony Wedgewood Benn approached <unk> and Leyland to see if they would buy out Chrysler and Rootes and keep the company British , but neither had the resources to do so . Later that year Chrysler was allowed to acquire a controlling interest in Rootes for a further investment of £ 20 million . 
 Manufacturing a car powered by a competitor 's engine was unacceptable to the new owner , but Chrysler 's own 273 small @-@ block V @-@ 8 was too large to fit under the Tiger 's bonnet without major modifications . Compounding the problem , the company 's small @-@ block V8 engines had the distributor positioned at the rear , unlike the front @-@ mounted distributor of the Ford V8 . Chrysler 's big @-@ block V8 had a front @-@ mounted distributor but was significantly larger . Shortly after the takeover Chrysler ordered that production of the Tiger was to end when Rootes ' stock of Ford V8 engines was exhausted ; Jensen assembled the last Tiger on 27 June 1967 . Chrysler added its <unk> logo to the car 's badging , and in its marketing literature de @-@ emphasised the Ford connection , simply describing the Tiger as having " an American V @-@ 8 power train " . 
 Rootes ' design director Roy Axe commented later that " The Alpine and Tiger were always oddballs in the [ Rootes ] range . I think they [ Chrysler ] didn 't understand it , or have the same interest in it as the family cars – I think it was as simple as that . " 
 The Tiger name was resurrected in 1972 when Chrysler introduced the Avenger Tiger , a limited @-@ edition modified Hillman Avenger intended primarily for rallying .

 Three racing Tigers were constructed for the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans , a prototype and two that were entered in the race . Costing $ 45 @,@ 000 each , they were highly modified versions of the production cars , fitted with <unk> coupe bodies produced by Lister . But they were still steel monocoques , and made the Le Mans Tigers 66 lb ( 30 kg ) heavier than a road @-@ going Tiger at 2 @,@ 615 lb ( 1 @,@ 186 kg ) , almost 600 lb ( 270 kg ) more than the winning Ferrari . The standard Ford four @-@ speed manual transmission was replaced with a <unk> T10 close @-@ ratio racing transmission , which allowed for a top speed of 140 miles per hour ( 230 km / h ) . 
 Both Tigers suffered early mechanical failures , and neither finished the race . The engines had been prepared by Shelby but had not been properly developed , and as a result overheated ; Shelby eventually refunded the development cost to Rootes . All three of the Le Mans Tigers have survived . 
 Once Rootes had made the decision to put the Tiger into production an Alpine IV minus engine and transmission was shipped to Shelby , who was asked to transform the car into a racing Tiger . Shelby 's competition Tiger made an early appearance in the B Production Class of Pacific Coast Division SCCA races , which resulted in some " highly successful " publicity for the new car . But Shelby was becoming increasingly preoccupied with development work for Ford , and so the racing project was transferred to the Hollywood Sports Car dealership , whose driver Jim Adams achieved a third @-@ place finish in the Pacific Coast Division in 1965 . A Tiger driven by Peter Boulton and Jim Latta finished twelfth overall and first in the small GT class at the 1965 Dayton Continental . The Tiger was also raced on quarter @-@ mile drag strips , and for two years was the American Hot Rod Association 's national record holder in its class , reaching a speed of 108 mph ( 174 km / h ) in 12 @.@ 95 seconds . 
 Rootes entered the Tiger in European rallies , taking first , second and third places in the 1964 Geneva Rally . Two Tigers took part in the 1965 Monte Carlo Rally , one finishing fourth overall , the highest placing by a front @-@ engined rear @-@ wheel drive car , and the other eleventh . After finally having sorted out the engine overheating problem by fitting a forward @-@ facing air scoop to the bonnet , Rootes entered three Tigers in the 1965 Alpine Rally , one of which crossed the finishing line as outright winner . Scrutineers later disqualified the car however , because it had been fitted with undersized cylinder head valves . By the end of the 1966 Acropolis Rally though , it had become clear that low @-@ slung sports cars such as the Tiger were unsuited to the increasingly rough @-@ terrain rally stages , and the car was withdrawn from competition soon after . In the words of Ian Hall , who drove the Tiger in the Acropolis Rally , " I felt that the Tiger had just had it – it was an out of date leviathan " .

 The 1965 Tiger Mark I gained some exposure on American television as the car of choice for Maxwell Smart in the spoof spy series Get Smart . The Tiger was used for the first two seasons in the opening credits , in which Smart screeched to a halt outside his headquarters , and was used through the remainder of the series in several episodes . Some of the scenes featured unusual modifications such as a retractable James Bond @-@ style machine gun that could not have fitted under the Tiger 's bonnet , so rebadged Alpine models were used instead . 
 Don Adams , who played the protagonist Maxwell Smart , gained possession of the Tiger after the series ended and later gave it to his daughters ; it is reportedly on display at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles . During its early years Rootes advertised the car extensively in Playboy magazine and lent a pink Tiger with matching interior to 1965 Playmate of the Year Jo Collins for a year . 
 The Tiger also featured in the 2008 film adaptation of the Get Smart TV series . A replica Tiger had to be constructed using a stock Sunbeam Alpine and re @-@ created Tiger badging as no available Tiger could be found in Canada , where the film was produced . The production team recorded the sound of an authentic Tiger owned by a collector in Los Angeles and edited it into the film .

 " I 'll Remember " is a song by American singer Madonna . It was released on March 8 , 1994 , by Warner Bros. Records as the soundtrack single of the film With Honors . It was a radical change in image and style for Madonna , who had received some negative critical and commercial feedback over the prior two years due to the release of her book Sex , the studio album Erotica and the film Body of Evidence . Warner Bros. had Madonna sing the song after noting most of her previous soundtrack singles had achieved commercial success . It utilizes a synthesized keyboard arrangement to bring about a continuously reverberating heartbeat sound . Madonna 's voice is supported by backing vocals . 
 Contemporary critics praised the song , hailing it as one of her best works . It was nominated for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television at the 37th Grammy Awards and Best Original Song at the 52nd Golden Globe Awards . " I 'll Remember " was also a commercial success , peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming her fourth number @-@ one hit on the Adult Contemporary chart . It also topped the singles charts in Canada and Italy . The accompanying music video portrayed Madonna singing the song in a stylized recording studio . Her look and style was compared to the imagery of the music video of previous single " Rain " . The androgynous portrayal of Madonna smoking in the last shot , was appreciated critically for breaking gender barriers .

 The year 1992 saw the release of the book Sex by Madonna . However , the book , which contained explicit sexual imagery and pictures of voyeuristic fantasies , was negatively accepted by the critics as well as some her fans . Madonna 's fifth studio album Erotica and the film Body of Evidence were released at the same time ; both failed to garner critical and commercial acclaim . Hence she decided to re @-@ invent her image , to connect with her fans and repair the damage that her provocative image had caused to her career . " I 'll Remember " was one of the songs that was developed for this purpose . The ballad was initially composed by musician Richard Page before being reworked by Madonna and Patrick Leonard . According to Page , " Madonna was brought in ... she changed all my lyrics for the better . She really did a great job . " Regarding her feelings for the song , Madonna commented , 
 " I think most of the time when my records come out , people are so much distracted by so much fanfare and controversy that nobody pays attention to the music . [ ... ] I can 't tell you how painful the idea of singing ' Like a Virgin ' or ' Material Girl ' ( 1984 ) is to me now . I didn 't write either of those songs , and wasn 't digging very deep then . I also feel more connected emotionally to the music I 'm writing now , so it 's more of a pleasure to do it . " 
 " I 'll Remember " was used as the theme song of the film With Honors , directed by Alek Keshishian . Madonna 's own label , Maverick , was charged with the task of putting together the soundtrack album . They decided to include " I 'll Remember " , after noticing that all of her soundtrack releases have been commercially successful . " I 'll Remember " did not appear on any Madonna album , but was later included in the ballads collection Something to Remember ( 1995 ) .

 According to author Rikky Rooksby , the song is written in the style of Album @-@ oriented rock ( AOR ) by bands like Boston or Foreigner . It is slowed down from the tempo of rock songs and utilizes a steadily reverberating synth keyboard to bring on the effect of a heartbeat . " I 'll Remember " has characteristics of late Seventies song apart from the arrangement and the low bass . Madonna sings in a low @-@ key voice which is almost overshadowed by the synth arrangement . Lyrically the song talks about Madonna looking back on a good love affair . According to Alex Balk from The Awl , the lyrics were inspirational , especially the line " I learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess " , which is answered by Madonna herself that " [ She ] remember , happiness " . 
 The song starts with a C major chord sequence and is used on the flattened seventh key of the sequence . But the actual key of the song is D major . It is set in a time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute . Madonna 's voice spans from F ♯ 3 to G4 . A much stronger arrangement of drums are used in the second verse . The chorus uses the chord sequence of D – G – Bm – A while the first two lines of each verse uses the chord progression of C – D – C – D7 – C – D – Bm – A. During the intermediate line " I learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess " , the structure changes to D / F ♯ – Bm – G – D – A – G – A. Backing vocals are used on the later choruses for support with the strings , cascading down to a minor arrangement before the third one . The song ends with fading out and devoid of any musical climax . 
 A number of remixes were issued alongside the regular version . The maxi @-@ single had four different versions , three being those of " I 'll Remember " and the fourth being a live version of the Erotica track , " Why It 's So Hard " , performed on The Girlie Show World Tour . According to Jose F. Promis from AllMusic , " the mixes of [ the song ] were conjured by William Orbit , giving each version an ethereal , spacey , and very mellow feel " . The " Guerilla Beach " mix was different from the original version , making it more adult contemporary oriented , while the " Orbit Remix " remained similar to the actual version .

 Author Christopher Feldman in his book , Billboard Book of Number 2 Singles , described the song as a " tender ballad . " Billboard music editor Timothy White called the song as lilting and one of Madonna 's classics in his book Music to My Ears : The Billboard Essays : Portraits of Popular Music in the ' 90s . He also complimented the song for talking about a dead relationship . Author Rikky Rooksby called the song as one of Madonna 's biggest ever singles and a stronger cut . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song as a " soundtrack gem " . Author J. Randy Taraborrelli in his biography of Madonna called the song a beautiful one . According to him , " it sounds like a flick theme too , equipped with smart chords and big emotion . It is reminiscent of another movie theme of Madonna 's , ' Live to Tell ' ( 1986 ) . " Music critique Peter Buckley noted that the song was atmospheric and one of Madonna 's best works , showing her ability to stay in touch with and adapt to musical developments . 
 " I 'll Remember " earned nominations for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television at the 37th Grammy Awards and Best Original Song at the 52nd Golden Globe Awards . Robbie Daw from Idolator listed it as one of " Madonna ’ s 10 Best Songs That Radio Forgot " , saying that " Madge has lost many friends and lovers over the years , but here she turns lemons into lemonade by cherishing the good times and learning from ' the way that you changed me ' . " Journalist Matthew Rettenmund listed the " Guerilla Beach " remix of the song at number nine on his list of " The 25 Best Madonna Remixes " , describing it as " spacey " and believing it to be " markedly superior to the lovely but unassuming original " . In 2014 , Graham <unk> from <unk> listed " I 'll Remember " as one of the " 12 Most Underrated Madonna Songs Of All Time " .

 The music video was directed by Alek Keshishian , who had previously directed the live performance versions of " Like a Virgin " ( 1984 ) and " Holiday " ( 1983 ) from the Truth or Dare documentary and also the music video of her single " This Used to Be My Playground " ( 1992 ) . The video featured production credits by Diane Greenwalt , editing by Patrick Sheffield and photography by Stephen Ramsey . According to Jerry Ryan from creative production team Steele , 
 " I 'll Remember " had multiple projection screen fills and classic theatre atmospherics ( like smoke haze and the flickering light beams from a projection booth ) added . The theatre walls and ceiling had digital enhancements . A sound booth was completely created from scratch to accompany a crane shot down to Madonna . All the movie inserts were treated to appear to be within the theater and all Madonna 's close ups and medium shots were individually treated for facial beauty enhancements . 
 The video features Madonna in a stylized recording studio singing the song with back up singers . The video was compared to the music video of Madonna 's single " Rain " ( 1993 ) . Her look in the video , consists of blue @-@ black icy hair , bright blue eyes and a long dark dress with a beaded necklace around her neck . Madonna 's face was mainly shot above her head , with her face looking up just ahead of the camera focus . Sometimes she looks to a video screen behind her which plays the scenes from the film , as if to take inspiration for her singing . Other times she is accompanied by her back @-@ up singers , mainly during the chorus , and sometimes she sings alone . In front of the studio , the producers are shown deciding which part of the song should be put in lower bass . 
 The music video ends with a shot of Madonna watching herself recording the song . In this last scene she is dressed in a long black coat and holds a cigarette in her hand . Scholars noted that this last shot clearly illustrates the gender paradox of Madonna , because as she watches her female form singing the song , she herself is dressed in an androgynous way , holding a cigarette , which is associated as one of the symbolic forms of male supremacy . Feminist writer Martha Leslie Allen lauded the video , as well as Madonna , " for breaking free of the conventional portrayal of women yet again , and displaying their duality . "
