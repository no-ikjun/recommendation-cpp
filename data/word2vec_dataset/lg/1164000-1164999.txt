 There are two basic approaches available for dealing with mutual couplings and active components . In the first of these , Samuel Jefferson Mason in 1953 introduced signal @-@ flow graphs . Signal @-@ flow graphs are weighted , directed graphs . He used these to analyse circuits containing mutual couplings and active networks . The weight of a directed edge in these graphs represents a gain , such as possessed by an amplifier . In general , signal @-@ flow graphs , unlike the regular directed graphs described above , do not correspond to the topology of the physical arrangement of components . 
 The second approach is to extend the classical method so that it includes mutual couplings and active components . Several methods have been proposed for achieving this . In one of these , two graphs are constructed , one representing the currents in the circuit and the other representing the voltages . Passive components will have identical branches in both trees but active components may not . The method relies on identifying spanning trees that are common to both graphs . An alternative method of extending the classical approach which requires only one graph was proposed by Chen in 1965 . Chen 's method is based on a rooted tree . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Another way of extending classical graph theory for active components is through the use of <unk> . Some electronic components are not represented naturally using graphs . The transistor has three connection points , but a normal graph branch may only connect to two nodes . Modern integrated circuits have many more connections than this . This problem can be overcome by using <unk> instead of regular graphs . 
 In a conventional representation components are represented by edges , each of which connects to two nodes . In a hypergraph , components are represented by <unk> which can connect to an arbitrary number of nodes . <unk> have tentacles which connect the hyperedge to the nodes . The graphical representation of a hyperedge may be a box ( compared to the edge which is a line ) and the representations of its tentacles are lines from the box to the connected nodes . In a directed hypergraph , the tentacles carry labels which are determined by the hyperedge 's label . A conventional directed graph can be thought of as a hypergraph with <unk> each of which has two tentacles . These two tentacles are labelled source and target and usually indicated by an arrow . In a general hypergraph with more tentacles , more complex labelling will be required . 
 <unk> can be characterised by their incidence matrices . A regular graph containing only two @-@ terminal components will have exactly two non @-@ zero entries in each row . Any incidence matrix with more than two non @-@ zero entries in any row is a representation of a hypergraph . The number of non @-@ zero entries in a row is the rank of the corresponding branch , and the highest branch rank is the rank of the incidence matrix . 
 = = = Non @-@ homogeneous variables = = = 
 Classical network analysis develops a set of network equations whose network variables are homogeneous in either current ( loop analysis ) or voltage ( node analysis ) . The set of network variables so found is not necessarily the minimum necessary to form a set of independent equations . There may be a difference between the number of variables in a loop analysis to a node analysis . In some cases the minimum number possible may be less than either of these if the requirement for homogeneity is relaxed and a mix of current and voltage variables allowed . A result from Kishi and <unk> in 1967 is that the absolute minimum number of variables required to describe the behaviour of the network is given by the maximum distance between any two spanning forests of the network graph . 
 = = = Network synthesis = = = 
 Graph theory can be applied to network synthesis . Classical network synthesis realises the required network in one of a number of canonical forms . Examples of canonical forms are the realisation of a driving @-@ point impedance by Cauer 's canonical ladder network or Foster 's canonical form or Brune 's realisation of an immittance from his positive @-@ real functions . Topological methods , on the other hand , do not start from a given canonical form . Rather , the form is a result of the mathematical representation . Some canonical forms require mutual inductances for their realisation . A major aim of topological methods of network synthesis has been to eliminate the need for these mutual inductances . One theorem to come out of topology is that a realisation of a driving @-@ point impedance without mutual couplings is minimal if and only if there are no all @-@ inductor or all @-@ capacitor loops . 
 Graph theory is at its most powerful in network synthesis when the elements of the network can be represented by real numbers ( one @-@ element @-@ kind networks such as resistive networks ) or binary states ( such as switching networks ) . 
 = = = Infinite networks = = = 
 Perhaps , the earliest network with an infinite graph to be studied was the ladder network used to represent transmission lines developed , in its final form , by Oliver Heaviside in 1881 . Certainly all early studies of infinite networks were limited to periodic structures such as ladders or grids with the same elements repeated over and over . It was not until the late 20th century that tools for analysing infinite networks with an arbitrary topology became available . 
 Infinite networks are largely of only theoretical interest and are the plaything of mathematicians . Infinite networks that are not constrained by real @-@ world restrictions can have some very unphysical properties . For instance Kirchhoff 's laws can fail in some cases and infinite resistor ladders can be defined which have a driving @-@ point impedance which depends on the termination at infinity . Another unphysical property of theoretical infinite networks is that , in general , they will dissipate infinite power unless constraints are placed on them in addition to the usual network laws such as Ohm 's and Kirchhoff 's laws . There are , however , some real @-@ world applications . The transmission line example is one of a class of practical problems that can be modelled by infinitesimal elements ( the distributed element model ) . Other examples are launching waves into a continuous medium , fringing field problems , and measurement of resistance between points of a substrate or down a borehole . 
 <unk> networks extend the idea of infinite networks even further . A node at an extremity of an infinite network can have another branch connected to it leading to another network . This new network can itself be infinite . Thus , topologies can be constructed which have pairs of nodes with no finite path between them . Such networks of infinite networks are called transfinite networks . 
 = From Bakunin to Lacan = 
 From Bakunin to Lacan : Anti @-@ <unk> and the <unk> of Power is a book on political philosophy by Saul Newman , published in 2001 . It investigates the essential characteristics of anarchist theory , which holds that government and hierarchy are undesirable forms of social organisation . Newman seeks to move beyond the limitations these characteristics impose on classical anarchism by using concepts from post @-@ structuralist thought . 
 By applying post @-@ structuralist theory to anarchism , Newman presents an account of post @-@ anarchism . His post @-@ anarchism is more substantive than that of earlier thinkers , and has influenced later approaches to the philosophy . Released in a climate of an anarchist movement hostile to postmodern philosophy , From Bakunin to Lacan was criticised for its poor understanding of and engagement with contemporary anarchism . 
 = = Background = = 
 The book was released in the context of the dispute in the newly resurgent anarchist movement between critics of civilisation ( primarily anarcho @-@ <unk> exemplified by John Zerzan ) and its supporters ( notably Murray Bookchin ) . Although sharply disagreeing on the merits of civilisation , technology and language , both Zerzan and Bookchin derided postmodernism as disempowering the individual and reinforcing the existing order . Another significant factor in the intellectual climate of the book 's release was the rediscovery in the 1990s of anarchist theory within academia . 
 Although foundational work had been done on the philosophy of postanarchism by radical theorists such as Andrew Koch and Todd May , From Bakunin to Lacan introduced a slightly different and more substantive formulation of the theory . 
 = = Content = = 
 Philosophy professor Todd May asserts that the overall purpose of the book is " to offer a critique of the way power , and specifically political power , is commonly conceived " . Newman persistently questions how anarchism can refrain from reproducing the forms of oppression that it strives to overcome . 
 Newman incorporates concepts from post @-@ structuralist thought such as post @-@ humanism and anti @-@ essentialism into classical anarchism . Unlike May , whose post @-@ anarchism is a combination of the two , Newman attempts to move beyond both anarchism and post @-@ structuralism . He proposes that " by using the poststructuralist critique one can theorize the possibility of political resistance without essentialist guarantees : a politics of postanarchism … by incorporating the moral principles of anarchism with the <unk> critique of essentialism , it may be possible to arrive at an ethically workable , politically valid , and genuinely democratic notion of resistance to domination " . 
 The book uses the work of French philosophers Michel Foucault , Gilles Deleuze , Félix Guattari , and Jacques Derrida as well as classical anarchist thinkers such as Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin , recognizing " proto @-@ poststructuralist " Max Stirner as an important forerunner of <unk> thought . Newman focuses particularly on the work of Deleuze , Derrida , and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Aimed at an academic rather than anarchist audience , the book was criticised in Anarchy : A Journal of Desire Armed # 57 for its unsophisticated , cursory understanding of and engagement with anarchist theory . While praising that section of the book on post @-@ structuralist philosophers , reviewer <unk> k claimed that " Newman uses Kropotkin and Bakunin as his stand @-@ ins for anarchism in general , and , in turn , only a few quotes from each to make his case " . He questioned whether Newman 's attribution of an essentialist conception of human nature to modern anarchists was accurate , concluding that had the book taken " a less one @-@ dimensional view of anarchism " , it would have to give up " most of what makes postanarchism post @-@ anarchism . 
 New Formulation reviewer Michael Glavin cited Newman 's ignorance of the initiative of anarchists to decentralize power and of anarchist forms of organisation such as trade unions , federations and affinity groups as evidence that he failed to understand power and wrongly conflated it with domination . 
 Since the publication of From Bakunin to Lacan in 2001 , there have been several attempts to develop an account of postanarchism that , while retaining many of Newman 's specific conceptions of the anarchistic qualities of radical post @-@ structuralist thought , would take <unk> theory beyond academic discourse and into broader and more diverse environments , as the originator of postanarchism , Hakim Bey , had intended . 
 = Yeovil = 
 Yeovil ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ vil ) is a town and civil parish in south Somerset , England with a population of 45 @,@ 000 . The town lies within the local district of South Somerset and the Yeovil parliamentary constituency , situated at the southern boundary of Somerset , 130 miles ( 210 km ) from London , 40 miles ( 64 km ) south of Bristol and 30 miles ( 48 km ) from Taunton . 
 It has palaeolithic remains , was on an old Roman road and was recorded in the Domesday Book as the town of <unk> or <unk> , and later became a centre for the glove @-@ making industry . During the Middle Ages the population of the town suffered from the Black Death and several serious fires . In the 20th century it developed into a centre of the aircraft and defence industries , which made it a target for bombing in the Second World War , with one of the largest employers being Westland Aircraft . Additionally , the Fleet Air Arm has a station RNAS Yeovilton ( HMS Heron ) , the primary base of the Royal Navy 's Westland Lynx and Sea King helicopters , several miles north of the town and is a major local employer ( Ministry of Defence ) . Several other manufacturing and retail companies also have bases in the town . Plans have been proposed for various regeneration projects in the town . 
 Yeovil Country Park , which includes <unk> , is one of several open spaces in the town . There are a range of educational , cultural and sporting facilities . Religious sites include the 14th @-@ century Church of St John the Baptist . It is on the A30 and A37 roads and has two railway stations on two separate railway lines . Yeovil Pen Mill is on the Bristol to Weymouth line served by First Great Western train operating company services , whilst Yeovil Junction is on the London Waterloo to Exeter line served by South West Trains . There is also a small railway museum . 
 = = History = = 
 Archaeological surveys have indicated signs of activity from the palaeolithic period , with burial and occupation sites located principally to the south of the modern town , particularly in Hendford where a Bronze Age golden torc ( twisted collar ) was found . Yeovil is on the main Roman road from Dorchester to the Fosse Way at Ilchester . The route of the old road is aligned with the A37 from Dorchester , Hendford Hill , <unk> , across the Westland site , to Larkhill Road and <unk> Lane , rejoining the A37 at the Halfway House pub on the Ilchester Road . The Westland site has evidence of a small Roman town . There were several Roman villas ( estates ) in the area , including finds at East Coker , West Coker and <unk> . 
 Yeovil was first mentioned in a Saxon charter dated 880 as <unk> . The name derives from the Celtic river @-@ name <unk> " forked river " , an earlier name of the River Yeo . The town was recorded in the Domesday Book as <unk> , a thriving market community . The parish of Yeovil was part of the Stone Hundred . After the Norman Conquest the manor , later known as Hendford , was granted to the Count of Eu and his tenant Hugh Maltravers , whose descendants became Earls of Arundel and held the lordship until 1561 . In 1205 it was granted a charter by King John . By the 14th century , the town had gained the right to elect a <unk> . The Black Death exacted a heavy toll , killing approximately half the population . In 1499 a major fire broke out in the town , destroying many of the wooden , thatched roofed buildings . Yeovil suffered further serious fires , in 1620 and again in 1643 . After the dissolution of the monasteries the lord of the manor was the family of John Horsey of Clifton Maybank from 1538 to 1610 and then by the Phelips family until 1846 when it passed to the <unk> of Newton Surmaville . Babylon Hill across the River Yeo to the south east of the town was the site of a minor skirmish , the Battle of Babylon Hill , during the English Civil War , which resulted in the Earl of Bedford 's Roundheads forcing back Sir Ralph Hopton 's Cavaliers to Sherborne . 
 During the 1800s Yeovil was a centre of the glove making industry and the population expanded rapidly . In the mid @-@ 19th century it became connected to the rest of Britain by a complex set of railway lines which resulted from competition between the 7 ft ( 2 @,@ 134 mm ) broad gauge lines of the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) and the 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) standard gauge lines of the London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) . In 1853 the Great Western Railway line was opened between Taunton and Yeovil . 
 The first railway in the town was a branch line from the Bristol and Exeter Railway near Taunton to a terminus at Hendford on the western side of the town , which opened on 1 October 1853 . As an associated company of the GWR , this was a broad gauge line . The GWR itself opened Yeovil Pen Mill railway station on the east side of the town as part of its route from London on 1 September 1856 ( this was extended to Weymouth on 1 January 1857 ) , and the original line from Taunton was connected to this . The LSWR route from London reached Hendford on 1 June 1860 but a month later the town was by @-@ passed by the extension of the LSWR to Exeter . A new station at Yeovil Junction was provided south of the town from where passengers could catch a connecting service to Hendford . On 1 June 1861 passenger trains were withdrawn from Hendford and transferred to a new , more central , Yeovil Town railway station . 
 In 1854 , the town gained borough status and had its first mayor . In the early 20th century Yeovil had around 11 @,@ 000 inhabitants and was dominated by the defence industry , making it a target of German raids during World War II . The worst of the bombing was in 1940 and continued until 1942 . During that time 107 high explosive bombs fell on the town . 49 people died , 68 houses were totally destroyed and 2 @,@ 377 damaged . 
 Industrial businesses developed in the area around the Hendford railway goods station to such a degree that a small Hendford Halt was opened on 2 May 1932 for passengers travelling to and from this district , but the growth of road transport and a desire to rationalise the rail network led to half of the railway stations in Yeovil being closed in 1964 . First to go was Hendford Halt which was closed on 15 June along with the line to Taunton , then Yeovil Town closed on 2 October . Long @-@ distance trains from Pen Mill had been withdrawn on 11 September 1961 leaving only Yeovil Junction with a service to London , but the service between there and Pen Mill , the two remaining stations , was also withdrawn from 5 May 1968 . 
 In April 2006 Yeovil became the first town in Britain to institute a somewhat controversial system of biometric fingerprint scanning in nightclubs . Individuals wishing to gain access to one of the town 's nightclubs were asked in the first instance to submit their personal details for inclusion in a central system . This included a photograph and index fingerprint . Thereafter , each entry to one of the participating premises required a fingerprint scan . The scheme is no longer in operation . According to Nigel J Marston , Licensing Manager of South Somerset District Council , the scheme was short lived as , " The company that originally supplied went through various changes of ownership and the project became unsupported . This allied to several of the venues closing down lead to the death of the scheme . " In February 2007 , Yeovil Town Council became the first English council to ban the children 's craze Heelys in the centre of the town and High Street . Skateboards , roller skates and roller blades are also illegal in the area . Councillors have stated this is due to " numerous complaints about the activities of youngsters " . 
 In late July 2007 , South Somerset District Council plans were made public by the Western Gazette to build a £ 21 m ' Yeovil Sports Zone ' on Yeovil Recreation Ground , which has been a popular open green space used by the local community for over seventy years . Residents fought to protect the Rec , leading to rejection of the proposals in 2009 , and further consultations in 2010 . 
 The free , informal recreational space of <unk> Rec , as it is known colloquially , was frequented by England Cricket great Ian Botham during his childhood stay in Yeovil . Another regeneration project was to have included the demolition of Foundry House , a former glove factory , however a local campaign led to this becoming a listed building and it will now be converted into a restaurant and offices and new shop and houses will be built on the surrounding site . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Officially designated as Yeovil Municipal Borough in 1854 , the town continued to lend its name to the area with the creation of the local government district of Yeovil on 1 April 1974 , with the merging several neighbouring rural and urban districts , which is today known as South Somerset . Some of the suburbs fall within the civil parishes of Yeovil Without and Brympton . 
 Yeovil still has a town council which took over the functions of the Charter Trustees in 1982 . The council has responsibility for the management of recreational and leisure facilities , open spaces and play areas . In 2005 , Yeovil Town Council became the first large council in Somerset to be awarded Quality Town Council status . 
 There are five electoral wards covering Yeovil . 
 Yeovil is a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . It elects one Member of Parliament ( MP ) by the first past the post system of election . The constituency covers the towns of Yeovil , Chard , Crewkerne and Ilminster in Somerset . Until 1983 Somerset was split into four constituencies and Yeovil constituency also contained the towns of Ilchester , Martock and Somerton but they were moved into the newly created constituency of Somerton and Frome . From the next election , Yeovil constituency will contain Ilchester once again to equalise the populations of the Somerset constituencies . The Boundary Commission for England estimate the electorate of Yeovil constituency after the pending boundary changes to be 77 @,@ 049 . The current MP is Marcus Fysh , a member of the Conservative Party . 
 Residents of Yeovil also form part of the electorate for the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament .

 = The Wiggles = 
 The Wiggles are an Australian children 's music group formed in Sydney , New South Wales , in 1991 . The current members of the group are Anthony Field , Lachlan Gillespie , Simon Pryce , and Emma Watkins . The original members were Field , Phillip Wilcher , Murray Cook , Greg Page , and Jeff Fatt . Wilcher left the group after their first album . Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran , but returned in 2012 , replacing Moran . At the end of 2012 , Page , Cook , and Fatt retired , and were replaced by Gillespie , Pryce , and Watkins . Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects . 
 Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s , and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University , where they were studying to become pre @-@ school teachers . In 1991 , Field was inspired to create an album of children 's music based upon concepts of early childhood education , and enlisted Cook , Page , and Fatt to assist him . They began touring to promote the album , and became so successful , they quit their teaching jobs to perform full @-@ time . The group augmented their act with animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur , Henry the Octopus , and Wags the Dog , as well as the character Captain Feathersword , played by Paul Paddick since 1993 . They travelled with a small group of dancers , which later grew into a larger troupe . The group 's DVDs , CDs , and television programs have been produced independently since their inception . Their high point came in the early 2000s , after they broke into the American market . 
 The group was formally consolidated in 2005 . They were listed at the top of Business Review Weekly 's top @-@ earning Australian entertainers four years in a row , and earned A $ 45 million in 2009 . In 2011 , the worldwide recession hit The Wiggles , as it had done for many Australian entertainers ; they earned $ 28 million , but they still appeared second on BRW 's list that year . The Wiggles have enjoyed almost universal approval throughout their history , and their music has been played in pre @-@ schools all over the world . They have earned several Platinum , Double Platinum and Multi @-@ Platinum records , as well as sold 23 million DVDs and 7 million CDs , and have performed , on average , to one million people per year . The group has also earned multiple Australasian Performing Rights Association ( APRA ) and Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) Music Awards . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Anthony Field and Jeff Fatt were members of The Cockroaches , a Sydney pop band known for their " good @-@ time R & B material " and several singles recorded by independent labels during the 1980s . In 1988 , Field 's infant niece , who was the daughter of Cockroaches founder and band member Paul Field , died of SIDS , and the group disbanded . Anthony Field enrolled at Macquarie University in Sydney to complete his degree in early childhood education , and later stated that his niece 's death " ultimately led to the formation of [ The ] Wiggles " . Murray Cook , also " a mature @-@ aged student " , was the guitarist in the pub rock band Bang Shang a Lang before enrolling at Macquarie . Greg Page , who had been a roadie for and sang with The Cockroaches during their final years , had enrolled in Macquarie to study early childhood education on Field 's recommendation . Field , Cook , and Page were among approximately 10 men in a program with 200 students . 
 In 1991 , while still a student , Field became motivated to use concepts in the field of early childhood education to record an album of music for children . The album was dedicated to Field 's niece . A song he wrote for The Cockroaches , " Get Ready to Wiggle " , inspired the band 's name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance . Like a university assignment , they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album . They needed a keyboardist " to bolster the rock 'n'roll feel of the project " , so Field asked his old band mate Fatt for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project . 
 The group received songwriting help from John Field , Anthony 's brother and former band mate , and from Phillip Wilcher , who was working with the early childhood music program at Macquarie . After contributing to their first album , hosting the group 's first recording sessions in his Sydney home , and appearing in a couple of the group 's first videos , Wilcher left the group and went into classical music . The group reworked a few Cockroaches tunes to better fit the genre of children 's music ; for example , The Cockroaches song " Hot Tamale " , written by John Field , was changed to " Hot Potato " . Anthony Field gave copies of their album to his young students to test out the effect of the group 's music on children ; one mother returned it the next day because her child would not stop listening to it . 
 To promote their first album , The Wiggles filmed two music videos with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) and created a self @-@ produced , forty @-@ minute @-@ long video version . Finances were limited , so there was no post @-@ production editing of the video project . They used Field 's nieces and nephews as additional cast , and hired the band 's girlfriends to perform in character costumes . Cook 's wife made their first costumes . They used two cameras and visually checked the performance of each song ; that way , according to Paul Field , it took them less time to complete a forty @-@ minute video than it took other production companies to complete a three @-@ minute music video . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 The Cockroaches ' former manager , Jeremy Fabinyi , became the group 's first manager . Using their previous connections , he negotiated with the ABC to air their TV show and to help them promote their first recording . The album cost approximately A $ 4 @,@ 000 to produce and it sold 100 @,@ 000 copies in 1991 . Field and Cook got teaching jobs , while Page finished his degree , so they could only perform during school holidays ; finding time to do so was , as Field reported , " challenging " . Fabinyi advised them to tour in unusual settings throughout Sydney and New South Wales . The Wiggles ' debut performance was at a friend 's daycare facility in Randwick , for about a dozen children . They played for crowds at shopping centres like Westfield in Sydney and at small pre @-@ school events and parties , and busked at Circular Quay , then moved on to regional tours and shows for playgroup associations , averaging about 300 people in the audience . They were promoted by local <unk> or nursing mothers ' associations with whom they split their proceeds . They performed at pre @-@ schools with other ABC children 's performers ; when 500 people attended these concerts just to see The Wiggles , they started doing their own shows , and according to Field , " Suddenly people started rolling up to performances in astonishing numbers " . 
 In 1993 , Field , Cook , and Page decided to give up teaching for a year to focus on performing full @-@ time , along with Fatt , to see if they could make a living out of it . As Fatt reported , " it was very much a cottage industry " . They used many of the business techniques developed by The Cockroaches , choosing to remain as independent and self @-@ contained as possible . John Field , Mike Conway , who later became The Wiggles ' general manager , trumpeter Dominic Lindsay , and Cockroaches saxophonist Daniel Fallon performed with them . Anthony Field , with input from the other members , did most of the production of their music , DVDs , and live shows . Their act was later augmented with supporting characters : the " friendly pirate " Captain Feathersword and the animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur , Henry the Octopus , and Wags the Dog . These characters were initially performed by the band members themselves : Field played Captain Feathersword and Wags ; Cook played Dorothy ; and Fatt played Henry . In 1993 , actor Paul Paddick , who became known as " the fifth Wiggle " and was as popular as the bandmembers , permanently joined the group to play Captain Feathersword . At first , the group travelled with a small group of dancers hired from a local dance studio to perform with them . 
 After the production of their second album , The Wiggles , who were called by their first names when they performed , began to wear costumes on stage as Fabinyi suggested and as The Cockroaches had done , and adopted colour @-@ coded shirts : Greg in yellow , Murray in red , Jeff in purple , and Anthony in blue . The coloured shirts also made it easier for their young audience to identify them . As Field reported , the decision to emphasise colour was " a no @-@ brainer , considering our pre @-@ school @-@ age audience " . Cook and Fatt already owned shirts in their colours , but Field and Page " met in a Sydney department store and literally raced to see who got the blue shirt " . Another early development used throughout the group 's history was their signature finger @-@ wagging move , which was created by Cook after seeing professional bowlers do it on television . They used the move when being photographed with children because it was their policy that touching children , no matter how innocently , was inappropriate . It also protected them from possible litigation ; as Paddick has explained , " There is no doubting where their hands are " . 
 = = = Success at home and abroad = = = 
 Through the rest of the 1990s , The Wiggles maintained a busy recording and touring schedule , becoming as Field reported and despite his strong dislike of touring , " the hardest @-@ working touring act in the country " . They released multiple albums and home videos and , depending upon the word of mouth of their audience , performed to increasingly large audiences in Australia and New Zealand despite having to re @-@ introduce themselves to a new audience of children every three years . They produced a new album and video each year and toured to promote them . By late 1993 , they " grew bigger than anyone had thought " , and hundreds attended their concerts ; by 1995 they had set records for music and video sales . In 1997 , Twentieth Century Fox produced a feature @-@ length film , The Wiggles Movie , which became the fifth @-@ highest grossing Australian film of 1998 , earning over a million @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half dollars . 
 In spite of their early success in Australia , Paul Field reported that the band was unable to produce a television program on the ABC , where they felt they would receive the most exposure to the pre @-@ school market . " Around 1996 – 1997 " , they filmed a television pilot for the ABC , but as The Sydney Morning Herald reported in 2002 , " the project never got off the ground due to irreconcilable artistic differences " . As a result , The Wiggles financed a TV program of 13 episodes themselves and sold it to the Disney Channel in Australia and to Channel Seven , where it became a hit . By 1998 , The Wiggles were ready to move on to international markets , despite its members ' health issues , especially Field 's . The reaction of producers in the UK was less positive than the group would have liked , although they were eventually able to make inroads there , but their real success came in the US . Disney arranged for them to perform at Disneyland in California , where they were discovered by Lyrick Studios , the producers of Barney & Friends . Both Anthony and Paul Field reported that Lyrick , despite their initial misgivings about whether American audiences would accept the band 's Australian accents , came to understand The Wiggles and their goals , and after successful tests with American children , enthusiastically promoted them . 
 The Wiggles used many of the same promotion techniques in the US that they had used in Australia , and chose to keep their concerts simple and maintain the same values that were successful in Australia . The Wiggles performed during the intermission of Barney Live stage shows , which The New York Times likened to " getting the warm @-@ up slot for the Stones " in the pre @-@ school entertainment world . In 2000 , when video sales took off in the US , Lyrick began to distribute Wiggles videos and advertised them by including Wiggles shorts as trailers in their Barney videos , which , as Anthony Field stated , " pushed us over the edge " . At first , the group 's videos were distributed in boutique stores such as FAO Schwarz and Zany <unk> , and on @-@ line . According to Paul Field , they entered the mass media market when their videos became top @-@ sellers at Amazon.com , and their first two videos , Yummy Yummy and Wiggle Time , landed in the top ten at Amazon.com. Stores such as Wal @-@ Mart began to take notice , and began to sell Wiggles videos . The band released nine DVDs in the next three years to keep up with the demand . 
 As they had done in Australia , The Wiggles chose to tour , but start off small , with simple props and sets instead of hiring a touring company . Some of their first appearances in America were at Blockbuster Video parking lots to small audiences — as Fatt said , " a dozen people " . They performed at small venues such as church halls and 500 @-@ seat theatres in Brooklyn and New Jersey , and upgraded to larger venues as ticket sales increased . Anthony Field reported that one week they would perform to 8 @,@ 000 in Sydney and to 20 people the following week at a parking lot in a small town in the US . One time , they performed for a dozen people at the Mall of America in Minnesota , but half of the audience were hired by Lyrick . Eventually , they moved to larger arenas such as the Beacon Theatre and Madison Square Garden . They performed at SeaWorld in Orlando , Florida , for six weeks . Their audiences began to increase , and they toured Australia , New Zealand , Hong Kong , the US , and the UK . 
 The Wiggles ' popularity in the US increased " in the shell @-@ shocked weeks after the terrorist attacks on New York City in 2001 " , when the group performed there , even when other acts cancelled their tours , a decision that earned them loyalty and respect . According to Cook , the press proclaimed that they were braver than many Australian sports teams that had cancelled their appearances . Paul Field stated , " New York has really embraced them . It was a kind of watershed . " Strong sales of The Wiggles videos eventually caught the attention of the Disney Channel in the US , who was impressed by their " strong pro @-@ social message " . In January 2002 , Disney began showing Wiggles video clips between their programs . By June of that year , the popularity of the clips prompted the Disney Channel to add both seasons of " The Wiggles " series to their schedule and showed full episodes multiple times per day . Field reported that despite their " modest production values " , the shows were popular with pre @-@ schoolers . 
 Beginning in 2002 , The Wiggles filmed four seasons ' worth of shows exclusively with the ABC . The network called them " the most successful property that the ABC has represented in the pre @-@ school genre " . By the end of 2002 , according to Field , " we knew we were involved in something extraordinary in the US " . Their concert schedule in North America doubled , seemingly overnight ; they began performing up to 520 shows per year all over the world . They also began to produce other stage shows in places The Wiggles themselves were unable to visit , in Australia , the UK , and US , that featured their characters , a host , and a few dancers . The Age called this time period ( about the mid @-@ 2000s ) the group 's " high point " ; they earned A $ 45 million a year in revenues , and had several licensing deals and an international distribution agreement with Disney . 
 Despite their success , founding member Anthony Field almost left the group in 2004 , shortly after his marriage and the birth of his first child , due to his serious medical issues , which were worsened by The Wiggles ' demanding tour schedule . After meeting chiropractor James <unk> in Chicago , Field improved his health to the point that he was able to continue . He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself , his fellow bandmembers , and castmembers in every city they performed , which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements . 
 = = = Page 's retirement = = = 
 In December 2005 , lead singer and founding member Page , at age 33 , underwent a double hernia operation . He withdrew from The Wiggles ' US tour in June 2006 , after suffering fainting spells , lethargy , nausea , and loss of balance . He returned to Australia , where doctors diagnosed his condition as orthostatic intolerance , a chronic but not life @-@ threatening condition . Page 's final performance with The Wiggles was in Kingston , Rhode Island . 
 On 30 November 2006 , the Wiggles announced Page 's retirement from the group . " I 'll miss being a part of The Wiggles very much , but this is the right decision because it will allow me to focus on managing my health " , Page said in a video message , which The Sydney Morning Herald called " unsettling " , posted on the group 's web page . Page was replaced by Sam Moran , who had served as an understudy for The Wiggles for five years and had already stood in for Page for 150 shows . Initially , The Wiggles struggled over their decision to replace Page , but after their audience 's positive response to Moran , they decided to continue as a group because they thought that was what their young audience would want . According to Fatt , who called it " a huge decision " and " a teachable moment " for them , they chose to be honest with their young audience as they made the transition from Page to Moran . As part owner of The Wiggles , Page received a payout of about $ 20 million . 
 = = = Moran era = = = 
 Although Moran 's transition as The Wiggles ' lead singer was " smooth " for the young children of their audience , it was more difficult for their parents . Moran said that " most children understood " . Field reported that by the group 's 20th anniversary in 2011 , due to the ever @-@ changing nature of their audience , most of their young fans were unfamiliar with Page . Cook stated that Moran 's transition was challenging for the group because since he replaced their lead singer , it changed their sound . Fatt characterised Moran 's singing style as more operatic , so they chose different keys to sing and perform . The Wiggles never publicly disclosed how much Moran was paid , but it was reported that he earned $ 200 @,@ 000 per year . Moran was featured in his first DVD and CD as a member of the group in early 2008 , and a sixth season of The Wiggles ' television series featuring Moran was filmed and began airing in Australia . 
 At the end of 2007 , The Wiggles donated their complete back catalogue of 27 master tapes to Australia 's National Film and Sound Archive . Their business ventures during these years included opening up " Wiggles World " sections in theme parks in North America and the Arab World , internet offerings , the creation of new television shows , and a five @-@ year @-@ long partnership with the digital cable channel Sprout in 2009 . In December 2010 , <unk> beamed a Wiggles concert live from Acer Arena into movie theatres all over Australia , for children and their families unable to attend their shows . 
 In early July 2011 , founding member Fatt developed arrhythmia and underwent " urgent but routine " heart surgery , when he was fitted with a pacemaker after feeling unwell for several weeks and blacking out . He missed the group 's US tour as a result , after not missing a show in 20 years . Also in mid @-@ 2011 , The Wiggles celebrated their 20th anniversary with circus @-@ themed shows and performances throughout Australia and the outback in a circus tent , as well as a " physically grueling " birthday @-@ themed tour of 90 shows throughout Australia , which Paul Field called " one of the biggest of their careers " . Sydney 's Powerhouse Museum commemorated the group 's anniversary with an exhibit that displayed Wiggles memorabilia . 
 In 2011 , the worldwide financial crisis hit the group , and they recorded their first drop in revenues in 10 years , at approximately $ 2 @.@ 5 million , a total decrease of 28 percent . Royalties partially offset the difference between their 2010 and 2011 revenues . Their managing director Mike Conway called 2011 their toughest year financially . For the first time , they had negative equity , with more liabilities than assets , and the owners had to provide the funds for them to continue operations . Conway stated that their losses were due to less touring time in the US , difficulties in placing their DVDs in Walmart , and their required investment in a new digital platform . 
 = = = Reunion with Page = = = 
 In January 2012 , and amidst a great deal of controversy , The Wiggles announced that Page had regained his health and was returning to The Wiggles . He returned as an employee " exactly on the same level as Sam " , rather than a co @-@ owner , having relinquished his business interest in the group after he left in 2006 . According to The Sydney Morning Herald , interest in Page 's return was sparked when they met during the group 's induction in the ARIA Hall of Fame in November 2011 . Business Review Weekly reported that the presentation of Moran 's departure had been mishandled and had potentially damaged their brand image . Paul Field agreed , stating that they " could have handled the communication and management of the transition better " . Cook later admitted that they were shocked by the backlash in the press and among the parents of their audience . 
 As part of his severance package , Moran continued to collect song royalties and was granted use of The Wiggles ' studios . 
 = = = Departure of Page , Cook , and Fatt = = = 
 In mid @-@ 2012 , The Wiggles announced that Page , Fatt , and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group ; Emma Watkins , the first female member of The Wiggles , replaced Page , Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt , and Simon Pryce replaced Cook . Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children . According to Paul Field , his brother staying in the band " was a vital decision to placate American , British and Canadian business partners " . Page , Fatt , and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group . Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years ; Cook announced his intention to retire first , citing a desire to spend more time with his family , and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter . Page , who was still struggling with his health issues , followed their lead , stating that his interest was in working with the group 's original line @-@ up . Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins , Gillespie , and Pryce . The new members , like Moran , who was not approached to return , were salaried employees . 
 The group , for their farewell tour , visited 8 countries and 141 cities , for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640 @,@ 000 people . Watkins , Gillespie , and Pryce wore " In Training " T @-@ shirts , and debuted the song " Do the Propeller ! " during these concerts . The final televised performance of the original band members , along with the new members , was on 22 December 2012 , during the annual Carols in the Domain in Sydney . Their final performance , after over 7000 shows over the years , was on 23 December at the Sydney Entertainment Centre . 
 Also by 2012 , The Wiggles performed to audiences whose parents attended their shows in their early years , and they were hiring performers who were part of their audience as young children . The Wiggles began airing a show on Sirius XM satellite radio in late 2012 , featuring the original members and their replacements , and stories and games for young listeners . In December , the group auctioned their famous " Big Red Car " ( called the " iconic Volkswagen Beetle Cabriolet " ) for charity for almost A $ 36 @,@ 000 on the auction site eBay . The money was donated to the Melbourne @-@ based charity SIDS and Kids . 
 = = = " New Wiggles " era = = = 
 The new iteration of The Wiggles , with Field and its new members , began touring in early 2013 . Cook became the group 's road manager in mid @-@ 2013 . Pryce reported that since The Wiggles ' audience changed every few years , the transition to the new group was easier for their young audience than it was for their parents . One of their challenges , especially for their early tours , was learning The Wiggles ' catalogue of 1400 songs . In early 2016 , Pryce described The Wiggles ' competitive culture of fitness , especially among the male cast , by citing the group 's grueling performance schedule , saying , " Sometimes it feels like it ’ s an extreme sport " . 
 After a seven @-@ year absence from Australian television , they filmed a new show , called Ready , Steady , Wiggle , filmed in their spare time at their studio in Sydney between tours and on the road . Watkins , who had a film @-@ making degree , played an important role in its production . The series was picked up by the on @-@ line streaming service Hulu in 2015 . Anthony Field admitted that they found it " hard going " until they returned to television . Merchandise featuring the original group outsold the new group 's products , and they failed to sell @-@ out their concerts . 
 By 2015 , Paul Field called the new group " an amazing success " . By that time , they produced 8 CDs and DVDs , and 3 new television series . Field reported that the new group went through the same process as the original group in terms of audience acceptance and " benchmarks of success " . They performed to sell @-@ out audiences throughout Australia , had high sales of their DVDs and CDs , and won an ARIA in 2014 . According to Kathy McCabe of News Corp Australia , it took 18 months for the new group to be accepted by their audience . McCabe credited their success to Watkins , who became the group 's stand @-@ out member . According to Field , an American journalist called her young fans , who came to concerts dressed in yellow and wearing bows like her , the " mini Emma army " . She was so popular , she starred in her own TV show , called " Emma " , without the other Wiggles , in 2015 . Field called her " an aspirational role model " for their young audience and reported that she had increased their fan base of girls . Field stated that the audience emulated her fashion choices , opening up new merchandising possibilities for the group . 
 In 2014 , The Wiggles doubled their ticket sales from the year before and played in sold @-@ out venues all over Australia and the world for 250 @,@ 000 fans . Hyde Park in Sydney had to be closed on Australia Day because fans filled it to see the group perform . They continued to sell @-@ out concerts throughout 2015 . Also in 2015 , the group produced their DVD , Rock and Roll Preschool , featuring musician David Campbell , and it was announced that The Wiggles would produce their second feature film ; comedian Ben Elton was slated to write the script and co @-@ write the soundtrack . In early 2015 , Gillespie and Watkins revealed that they had been dating for two years ; they announced their engagement in May 2015 . They were married on 9 April 2016 at <unk> House in Bowral in New South Wales , Australia . 
 The Wiggles celebrated their 25th anniversary with a performance by the new members , published as a free podcast on iTunes , in front of the Apple Store in Sydney in January 2016 . In February , the original group members were to perform a charity concert for their fans over the age of 18 , who were part of their first audiences , at the Dee Why RSL club in Sydney . 
 = = Band members = = 
 = = Musical style = = 
 The Wiggles have written new music each year since their inception ; they sequestered themselves for a month each summer and wrote three albums ' worth of original children 's music based on simple concepts familiar to young children , and using several genres of music and types of instruments . Most of their songs were short and started with the chorus because they felt that young children needed to be presented with a song 's topic in their first few lines . They wrote songs individually at first , but eventually wrote as a group , often with John Field , trumpet player Dominic Lindsay , and Paddick . Fatt , the only member of the original group without a degree in early childhood education , tended to focus on composing music . Fatt told reporter Brian <unk> , who called the group 's songwriting process " a collaborate affair " , that they wrote repetitive pop songs or jingles , which were appealing to children . Watkins reported that she was invited to write songs for their albums , even though she was primarily a dancer . John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival , who appeared in a Wiggles video in 2002 , told The New York Times that he was " very impressed " with the group 's songwriting , especially with their drum sound . 
 According to Field , the transition from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children 's music was not a big one for The Wiggles . " The Wiggles music isn 't all that far removed from what we did in The Cockroaches , just a different subject matter " , Field stated . " The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that ; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti . " Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to , and then made them appropriate for children . They approached simple and <unk> topics , such as food and nutrition , as teachers would in a pre @-@ school setting , with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember . The group sang the same 60s @-@ style pop as The Cockroaches , but with different lyrics , although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children , which was limitless . The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes , folk music , and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s . Page reported , " First and foremost , we 're entertainers " . The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them , and then by presenting them with educational messages . 
 The group wrote and performed children 's music that was different from what had been done previously ; as Cook stated , " we didn 't just go down the route of what people think is kids ' music " . They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio ; while some of their recordings were orchestral , others had a more live feel . The group was aware that their songs were often children 's first exposure to music . Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook was one of the first guitarists children were exposed to , he may be the most influential guitarist in the world . Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see , and said , " I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great . I think it would be really nice if in 15 years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [ The ] Wiggles " . In 2013 , after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager , he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band " they got into " . 
 = = Educational theory = = 
 The Wiggles ' songwriting and performances were rooted in their professional training as pre @-@ school teachers and in the concepts of early childhood education . Anthony Field reported , as he studied music for young children at university , being " shocked ... at the non @-@ inclusive way music for children was usually performed " . According to Field , children had to sit silently as musicians played " traditional songs often featuring negative or outdated lyrics and dealing with subject matter of no interest to small children " . The lack of songs with themes and topics that interested children inspired Field to record The Wiggles ' first album . 
 The group 's " golden rule " , according to Field , was to make the content of their songs and shows " developmentally appropriate and fun " . Their music , stage shows , and television and DVD productions were developed , as The New York Times reported , " from the premise that a young child has a short attention span , is curious about a limited number of objects and activities , loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements " . They also respected their audience 's intelligence and insight about entertainment , information , and honesty . As Field said , " Young children identify with relevant concepts , and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment . They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct , inclusive , and positive " . The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it . They believed that young children were egocentric , so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows , and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe . 
 The Wiggles ' stage shows were full of action and audience participation . By the group 's " New Wiggles " iteration , The Sydney Morning Herald called their shows slick and fast @-@ paced , with inside jokes for the adult members of their audience . The bandmembers tended to wander throughout the audience , " thrilling toddlers and smartphone wielding guardians alike " . Pryce , as an experienced stage performer , was conscious that their shows were the first live theater young children experienced ; as a result , the group adapted the content of their shows to accommodate their audience 's development and understanding . Paddick 's role as Captain Feathersword became more important in the mid @-@ 1990s , especially in the group 's stage shows , when he was able to incorporate his circus and opera training , as well as impersonations that were popular with their audience 's parents . 
 They believed in empowering children by practices such as greeting their audience members with " Hello , everyone " , instead of " Hello , boys and girls " because as Paul Field has explained , the second greeting " unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension " . Kathleen Warren , the group 's former professor at Macquarie University , believed that the group 's practice of asking their audience to " Wake Up Jeff " when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was " very much in keeping with the way they work with children " . Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt 's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives . Fatt was the only original member of The Wiggles without a background in early childhood education ; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that " it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything " . Paul Field reported that children in The Wiggles ' audience felt " great excitement " and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way . Anthony Field , who called it " a simple audience participation and interaction gag we 've done since the start of the group " , claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences . The group 's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group , but it became Fatt 's gimmick because " it was a perfect fit " . When Fatt retired , Gillespie took over the task of falling asleep . 
 Simple movements were developed by their choreographers , including <unk> Ashley , to accompany each song because , as The New York Times reported , they believed " in the power of basic movements to enchant young children " . According to reporter Anders Wright , they intentionally made mistakes in their dance moves in order to identify more with their young audience . The group incorporated more dancing into their performances after the birth of Field 's oldest daughter in 2004 . " So [ The ] Wiggles have kind of become a bit more , dare I say , girly . Dorothy ( the Dinosaur ) does ballet now and we dance as well a lot more than we did " , Field reported . In later years , corresponding with Field 's developing interests in acrobatics and gymnastics , they added these elements to their stage shows , including , as Field reported , hiring several world @-@ class athletes such as former trampoline champion Karl Shore . Watkins , whom Paul Field called " a dancer of many disciplines " , was initially hired as a member of their troupe and referred to herself as " mainly a dancer " . 
 Between 1999 and 2003 , to test the group 's appeal across cultures , Warren used one of The Wiggles ' CDs as an educational tool in a village near Madang , on the north coast of Papua New Guinea . She found that the <unk> children were able to relate to the group 's songs , and that they were able to sing along and participate in their simple choreography . Although The Wiggles ' recorded and performed songs , dances , and musical styles from different cultures and languages , The Wiggles did not find that adapting their music to non @-@ Australian cultures was necessary to reach children in other countries . As Cook stated , " ... Toddlers don 't have the same hang ups as adults " . The Wiggles recognised that as long as they spoke at the same level as their audience , their Australian accents would not matter , and that young children were able to adapt to a variety of contexts and to different pronunciations of common words , no matter where they resided . 
 = = Brand and finances = = 
 Despite Anthony Field 's expressed dislike of the term , preferring to refer to it as " preserving the good name of The Wiggles " , the group has stressed the importance of their brand and were protective of it . They remained as independent as possible , and retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business . As Field stated , The Wiggles Pty Ltd was " not your regular ' corporate culture ' " . They made decisions by consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education . They made careful decisions regarding their endorsements of toys and other products , and avoided over @-@ extending their brand by only licensing products that correlated with their image . They had high expectations regarding the behaviour and attitude of everyone associated with the group . 
 The Wiggles became formally consolidated in 2005 . The group 's board of directors consisted of the original three members , Paul Field , who has been general manager of operations since the group was formed and their manager since the mid @-@ 1990s , and Mike Conway , who had worked for Ernst & Young in England and become their general manager in 2001 . In 2009 , the Australian rock band AC / DC knocked The Wiggles , who earned A $ 45 million , from the top of Business Review Weekly 's ( BRW ) list of top entertainment earners for the first time in four years . In 2011 , the worldwide recession hit The Wiggles , as it had done for many Australian entertainers ; they earned A $ 28 million , but they still appeared second on the BRW 's list that year . By 2012 , founding members Anthony Field , Cook , and Fatt retained 30 % ownership of their brand , and Paul Field and Conway each owned 5 % . It was reported that as part owner of The Wiggles , Page was given a A $ 20 million payout when he left the group in 2006 . Other ventures of The Wiggles Pty Ltd included franchising their concept to South America , Taiwan , and other countries , opening " Wiggles World " sections in theme parks , and online offerings . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Wiggles enjoyed " almost universal approval " throughout their history . Their songs were sung and played in pre @-@ schools all around the world . Between 2000 and 2010 , The Wiggles earned 21 Gold records . According to a 2012 news release published to announce the retirement of Cook , Fatt , and Page , they earned several Platinum , Double Platinum and Multi @-@ Platinum records , as well as sold 23 million DVDs and 7 million CDs . They performed , on average , to one million people per year . 
 After 2003 , front @-@ row tickets to their sold @-@ out concerts in the US were scalped for US $ 500 . The group responded by reducing the number of seats sold per transaction , in order to keep prices down and avoid further tickets scalping . In 2008 , the group found themselves in the midst of what The Daily Telegraph called a " ticketing scandal " ; scalpers tried to sell a A $ 19 ticket on eBay for almost A $ 2 @,@ 000 and a set of three tickets for A $ 315 for concerts in Melbourne , and a group of three tickets to a Wiggles UNICEF charity concert in Sydney had a price tag of A $ 510 . The tickets were taken off eBay and voided . 
 In what Paul Field called " one of the highlights of their 15 years of being together " , The Wiggles were awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Australian Catholic University in 2006 . Cook gave an address during the private ceremony honouring them . They were awarded another honorary doctoral degree in 2009 from their alma mater , Macquarie University . The group was named UNICEF goodwill ambassadors in 2008 ; they held a special concert to raise money for the organisation . In 2010 , the four original members of The Wiggles were appointed Members in the Order of Australia for their service to the arts in Australia , especially children 's entertainment , and for their contributions and support of several charities . They called the honour their " biggest recognition yet " . The group has always invited children with special needs and their families to pre @-@ concert " meet and greet " sessions . According to Fatt , many parents of these children have reported that The Wiggles ' music has enhanced their lives , and that children with autism " respond to [ The ] Wiggles and nothing else " . The Wiggles , throughout their history , have visited and performed for patients at the Sydney Children 's Hospital every Christmas morning . 
 In 2011 , ABC Music released an album titled " <unk> – A Tribute To The Wiggles " to celebrate the group 's 20th anniversary . The album features covers of many favourite Wiggles songs performed by notable Australian music artists .

 = Michael Kidd = 
 Michael Kidd ( August 12 , 1915 – December 23 , 2007 ) was an American film and stage choreographer , dancer and actor , whose career spanned five decades , and staged some of the leading Broadway and film musicals of the 1940s and 1950s . Kidd , who was strongly influenced by Charlie Chaplin and Léonide Massine , was an innovator in what came to be known as the " integrated musical " , in which dance movements are integral to the plot . 
 He was probably best known for his athletic dance numbers in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers , a 1954 Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer musical , and for choreographing Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in the " Girl Hunt Ballet " and " Dancing in the Dark " numbers in the 1953 musical film The Band Wagon . Film critic Stephanie Zacharek called the barn @-@ raising sequence in Seven Brides " one of the most rousing dance numbers ever put on screen " . He was the first choreographer to win five Tony Awards , and was awarded an honorary Academy Award in 1996 for advancing dance in film . 
 = = Early life and dance career = = 
 Kidd was born Milton Greenwald in New York City on the Lower East Side , the son of Abraham Greenwald , a barber , and his wife Lillian , who were refugees from Czarist Russia . He moved to Brooklyn with his family and attended New Utrecht High School . He became interested in dance after attending a modern dance performance , and went on to study under Blanche Evan , a dancer and choreographer . 
 He studied chemical engineering at the City College of New York , in 1936 and 1937 , but left after being granted a scholarship to the School of American Ballet . He toured the country as a member of the corps de ballet of Lincoln Kirstein ’ s Ballet Caravan , and performed in roles that included the lead in Billy the Kid , choreographed by Eugene Loring , which featured an orchestral arrangement by Aaron Copland . 
 He adopted the name " Michael Kidd " in 1942 . At the time he was performing with Ballet Caravan and all the dancers were urged to adopt " American " names . He chose Kidd because it was short , easy to remember , and evocative of the pirate , Captain Kidd . 
 In 1941 , Kidd became a soloist and assistant to Loring in his Dance Players . He moved on to become a soloist for Ballet Theater , later known as the American Ballet Theater . His performances there included Fancy Free ( 1944 ) choreographed by Jerome Robbins and with music by Leonard Bernstein , in which he played one of the three sailors . While at the ABT , he created his own ballet , On Stage ! ( 1945 ) . Although the play and his performance were well received , and the New York Times observed that Kidd was " hailed as one of the great hopes of postwar American ballet , " he left Loring 's company for Broadway in 1947 and never again worked in ballet . 
 = = Broadway and Hollywood = = 
 Kidd 's first choreography on Broadway was for <unk> Harburg 's Finian 's Rainbow , a lyrical musical that explored racial prejudice . Kidd won his first Tony Award for that play . However , his next Broadway musicals were not successful . They were Hold It , a college musical , and the Kurt Weill / Alan Jay Lerner musical Love Life , directed by Elia Kazan , which both had short runs in 1948 . Next came Arms and the Girl ( 1950 ) , directed by Rouben Mamoulian , with Pearl Bailey and Nanette Fabray , also a flop . 
 His next play , Frank Loesser ’ s Guys and Dolls ( 1950 ) , cemented his reputation as a Broadway choreographer . It was based on Damon Runyon short stories , with book by Abe Burrows , and earned Kidd his second Tony Award . The play attracted the attention of movie producers , and he was lured to Hollywood . 
 His first film was a 1952 film adaptation of Frank Loesser 's 1948 Broadway musical , Where 's Charley ? , starring Ray Bolger repeating his Broadway performance in the lead role . His first big film success came the following year , with The Band Wagon , starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse . 
 The Band Wagon , which featured the music and lyrics of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz , included an extensive dance sequence at the end , the " Girl Hunt Ballet " featuring Astaire and Charisse , which was a spoof of hard @-@ boiled Mickey Spillane novels . Kidd was hired to stage the film 's dances at Astaire 's request , because he was nervous about the ballet . Kidd said that he made Astaire comfortable by pretending that he was just making up the steps spontaneously . The film also featured " Shine on Your Shoes " , set in a 42nd Street penny arcade and featuring Astaire and LeRoy Daniels , a real @-@ life shoe @-@ shiner , and " Dancing in the Dark " with Charisse , set in Central Park . 
 Kidd 's work for the 1954 film Seven Brides for Seven Brothers brought him acclaim . The film was directed by Stanley Donen , with music by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul and lyrics by Johnny Mercer . It was written directly for the screen and based on the short story " The <unk> ' Women " , by Stephen Vincent Benét , which was based in turn on the ancient Roman legend of The Rape of the Sabine Women . He initially turned down the assignment , recalling in 1997 : " Here are these <unk> living off in the woods . They have no schooling , they are uncouth , there 's manure on the floor , the cows come in and out — and they 're gonna get up and dance ? We 'd be laughed out of the house . " 
 The entire cast , even extras , consisted of a melange of dancers , acrobats and stuntmen , including the ballet dancers Jacques D 'Amboise of the New York City Ballet and Marc Platt , formerly of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo . Except for Howard Keel and Jane Powell , the roles of the brothers and their brides were all played by professional dancers at Kidd 's insistence . Mercer said that the musical numbers were written at Kidd 's behest , as an example " of how a songwriter sometimes has to take his cue from his collaborators " . For example , Kidd explained to Mercer and <unk> his conception of the " Lonesome Polecat " number , the lament of the brothers for the women , and the two worked out the music and lyrics . 
 By the mid @-@ 1950s Hollywood 's output of movie musicals had begun to wane , and he worked on only two during that decade . He made his movie acting debut in It 's Always Fair Weather ( 1955 ) , directed by Gene Kelly and Donen , in which Kelly , Kidd and Dan Dailey played three ex @-@ GIs meeting ten years after the war , only to discover they had little in common . The film featured an exuberant number in which the three dance with garbage can lids fastened to their feet . The downbeat film was a critical success but was not heavily promoted by the studio , and failed at the box office . The film was originally designed to be a sequel to the 1949 film On the Town , but Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin were unavailable , and the film lacked chemistry between the three actors . The production was marked by constant strife between Donen and Kelly , with much of it stemming from Donen striving unsuccessfully to include a ten @-@ minute dance solo by Kidd , " Jack and the Space Giants " . Kelly rejected that , which Kidd took as a personal insult , and Donen went further , ending his collaboration with Kelly for the rest of their lives . The " Jack " number appears as a bonus feature on a DVD of the film , and one commentator suggests that Kelly 's judgment was not wrong , as the number was listless and did not advance the plot . 
 Kidd was both director and choreographer for the musical comedy film Merry Andrew ( 1958 ) , starring Danny Kaye . By the then the era of movie musicals was pretty much over , and Kidd turned his attention to Broadway , where he had continued to work while choreographing movies . At the same time that he was choreographing The Band Wagon he was staging dances for Cole Porter ’ s Broadway musical Can @-@ Can . In that show he created dance numbers for Gwen Verdon which helped make her a Broadway sensation . 
 His other Broadway shows during the 1950s included Li 'l Abner in 1956 , which he directed as well as choreographed . He won another Tony Award for his choreography , which was adapted for the film version in 1959 . After Merry Andrew , however , he made no other films until Star ! , with Julie Andrews , in 1968 . Neither film was successful . 
 On Broadway he directed and choreographed Destry Rides Again ( 1959 ) , with Andy Griffith , Wildcat ( 1960 ) , which starred Lucille Ball , Subways Are for Sleeping ( 1961 ) , a musical comedy about homelessness , and Ben Franklin in Paris ( 1964 ) , starring Robert Preston . He also choreographed the famous Broadway flop Breakfast at Tiffany 's ( 1966 ) , a musical version of the Truman Capote novella with Mary Tyler Moore and Richard Chamberlain that never officially opened . 
 He choreographed the 1969 film adaptation of the hit Broadway play Hello , Dolly ! The film was beset by tension on the unhappy set , with Barbra Streisand clashing with her costar Walter Matthau and director Gene Kelly ; Kidd also had conflicts with costume designer Irene Sharaff and Kelly , to the point that he and Kelly were no longer on speaking terms . The film was not a success as a musical , with Kelly and Kidd making little use of the widescreen format of the film . Critic Tom Santopietro described their approach as " shoveling more and more bodies on screen with no apparent purpose " . 
 He went on to direct and choreograph the 1970 Broadway musical The Rothschilds , starring Hal Linden , and directed The Goodbye Girl , with Bernadette Peters and Martin Short , a 1993 adaptation of the 1977 Neil Simon film that was his final Broadway play . Although he was nominated for a Tony Award for best director , reviews were mixed . In The New York Times , Frank Rich said that " Kidd , who did much to define slam @-@ bang Broadway and Hollywood musical @-@ comedy style in the 1950s , directs ' The Goodbye Girl ' in a mechanical reduction of that style : everything is fast , furious , loud and downstage center . Not that any director could overcome this musical 's physical production . " 
 Kidd appeared in supporting roles as a character actor in the 1970s and 1980s , beginning with his performance as the faded , cynical choreographer for a cheesy beauty pageant in the satirical 1975 film Smile , which starred Bruce Dern . Film critic Roger Ebert called Kidd 's portrayal of the pageant choreographer a " finely etched <unk> performance " . He acted in and staged the musical sequences in the 1978 film Movie Movie , which was directed by Stanley Donen , with whom he 'd worked in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and It 's Always Fair Weather . Kidd directed an episode of the TV comedy Laverne and Shirley ( 1990 ) , as well as scenes for Janet Jackson in two music videos , When I Think of You ( 1986 ) and Alright ( 1990 ) . He conceived and choreographed the television special Baryshnikov in Hollywood , starring Mikhail Baryshnikov , in 1982 , for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Kidd died of cancer at the age 92 at his home in Los Angeles , California . His marriage to the dancer Mary Heater in 1945 ended in divorce . At his death he was survived by his wife <unk> Hackett , whom he married in 1969 , two daughters from his first marriage and a son and daughter from his second . 
 Kidd was the uncle of filmmaker and political activist , Robert Greenwald . His older brother was Harold Greenwald , a prominent psychotherapist and best @-@ selling author of the 1958 book The Call Girl , who was an expert in the study of prostitution . 
 = = <unk> style = = 
 Kidd was unusually well @-@ respected , and his judgment was granted deference by the leading dancers of his era . British critic and biographer Michael Freedland said at the time of his death that " when Gene Kelly danced through the street with a dustbin lid tied to his feet in the 1955 film It 's Always Fair Weather , the man who usually planned his own routines did it to Kidd 's order " . 
 His realistic approach , designing dances that were inspired by the way ordinary people behaved , led one critic to observe that " Kidd is , in a way , the originator of the fantasy that if only your life shaped up and offered you the right moments , you too would be able to dance like a Hollywood star " . 
 Kidd believed that dance needed to derive from life , saying that his " dancing is based on naturalistic movement that is abstracted and enlarged " , and that " all my movements relate to some kind of real activity " . He always wanted dance to serve the story , and when beginning a new work he would write a scenario , explaining how the plot drove the characters to dance . His biggest influences were Charlie Chaplin , " because he expressed through movement the aspirations of the little man " , and the dancer and choreographer Léonide Massine , " because he expressed more than just balletic ability — he was always a character on stage , an exaggerated character , which I do all the time : an exaggeration of ordinary movement " . 
 His distinct style was evident in his early days in ballet . Describing a rare film clip of his performance in On Stage , dance critic Anna Kisselgoff recounted that Kidd in one scene played a handyman consoling ballerina Janet Reed , playing a shy young woman at a ballet audition . " Classical technique was used to expressive purpose as the wonderful Miss Reed grew visibly exuberant and confident as Mr. Kidd , broom in hand , entertained her with his virtuosic performance . " 
 He once said that " in choreography , ordinary movements from real life are taken and extended , so they become dance movements , yet the relation to reality must always be there . It 's important for me to know who the characters are and what their function is in the script . I must be able to illustrate either their activities , their emotions , or their changes in mood by the way they dance , all the while keeping the dance movements footed in reality and yet making the movements sort of odd and eccentric . " This philosophy was reflected in the early scene from The Band Wagon , when Fred Astaire walks down a railroad platform singing " By Myself . " His walk was not quite a dance , and epitomized Kidd 's style . 
 In a 2012 appreciation of his work , Dance Teacher said that " Kidd drew from the vocabularies of ballet , modern , social dance and acrobatics . But above all , his choreography stemmed from realistic movements and gestures . Following in the tradition of Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins , who developed the integrated musical , Kidd created dances that helped to carry the plot and flesh out the characters . He put the story first , communicating it through dance . " Kidd once said that " every move , every turn should mean something . Dancing should be completely understandable . " In Seven Brides for Seven Brothers he employed leading ballet dancers , but insisted that his dancers avoid ballet dance moves , and instead focus on " work movements like ax wielding " . 
 In choreographing Seven Brides , Kidd once said that he " had to find a way to have these backwoods men dance without looking ridiculous . I had to base it all around activities you would accept from such people — it couldn 't look like ballet . And it could only have been done by superbly trained dancers . " Yet he was able to integrate into the cast a non @-@ dancer MGM contract player who was assigned to the film , Russ Tamblyn , by utilizing his talents as a gymnast and tumbler in the dance numbers . 
 Kidd 's personal favorite of the films he choreographed , however , was not Seven Brides or Band Wagon but Guys and Dolls , which he felt was " the best , most inventive and best integrated musical I 've ever seen " . 
 Although he came from the world of classic ballet , a Los Angeles Times critic noted at his death that he had " a healthy disdain for its pretensions " . He staged a comedic ballet sequence for the 1954 Danny Kaye film Knock on Wood , in which Kaye is chased into a theater and hides on stage during a performance by a Russian ballet company . The sequence allowed Kidd to lampoon the stylistic excesses he 'd observed as a dancer at the American Ballet Theater . 
 As in his choreography for both the Broadway and 1955 film adaptation of Guys and Dolls , and in the " Girl Hunt Ballet " , Kidd 's choreography in Seven Brides exuded masculinity . One history of the musical theater observes that " Kidd forged dances , and shows , in which men were men , leaping high , stout hearted , and passionate about their dolls " . He choreographed " for the little guy , the working guy , the guy defined by his job and the movement that job entailed " . 
 Although Kidd drove his dancers hard , partly because he himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he required of them , his personal style was gentle . Nanette Fabray , who performed in Love Life , could only make dancing turns to the left side because of a hearing problem . Rather than insisting she turn to the right , as many choreographers would do , Kidd " found that fascinating , and he made all the other dancers turn to the left " . Julie Andrews recalled that the " Burlington Bertie From Bow " number in Star ! was physically demanding , and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake , saying she had a bad back . Andrews recalled that " he looked crestfallen . Then he said , ' I wasn 't trying to be mean . I just knew that when you saw it on film , you wouldn 't be pleased . ' I always thought that was a nice way to say , ' Once more . ' "

 Kidd was the first choreographer to win five Tony Awards , and received nine Tony nominations . He was awarded an honorary Academy Award in 1997 " in recognition of his services to the art of dance in the art of the screen " . 
 He was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981 .

 = Copenhagen Metro = 
 Copenhagen Metro ( Danish : <unk> Metro ) is a rapid transit system serving the cities of Copenhagen , Frederiksberg , and <unk> in the Capital Region , Denmark . 
 The 20 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 12 @.@ 7 mi ) system opened between 2002 and 2007 , and has two lines , M1 and M2 . The driverless light metro supplements the larger S @-@ train rapid transit system , and is integrated with DSB local trains and Movia buses . Through the city center and west to Vanløse , M1 and M2 share a common line . To the southeast , the system serves Amager , with the 13 @.@ 9 @-@ kilometre ( 8 @.@ 6 mi ) M1 running through the new neighborhood of Ørestad , and the 14 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometre ( 8 @.@ 8 mi ) M2 serving the eastern neighborhoods and Copenhagen Airport . The metro has 22 stations , of which nine are underground . In 2013 , the metro carried 55 million passengers . 
 = = Overview = = 
 The system is owned by Metroselskabet , which is owned by the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg , and the Ministry of Transport . The 34 trains are of the AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro class and stationed at the Control and Maintenance Center at Vestamager . The trains are 2 @.@ 65 m ( 8 ft 8 in ) wide and three cars long ; their 630 @-@ kilowatt ( 840 hp ) power output is supplied by a 750 @-@ volt third rail . The metro trains were originally planned to be four cars long , but trains were reduced to three cars per set as a savings measure . Platforms are - although shorter than originally planned - built to accommodate train with four cars , and the automatic doors can be modified accordingly should the need arise . 
 Operation of the system is subcontracted to Metro Service . Trains run continually , twenty @-@ four hours a day , with the headway varying from two to twenty minutes . 
 Planning of the Metro started in 1992 as part of the redevelopment plans for Ørestad with construction starting in 1996 , and stage 1 , from Nørreport to Vestamager and Lergravsparken , opened in 2002 . Stage 2 , from Nørreport to Vanløse , opened in 2003 , followed by stage 3 , from Lergravsparken to Lufthavnen , in 2007 . Construction of the M3 + M4 City Circle Line is underway . Scheduled to open in 2020 , this line will form a circle around the city center , be entirely underground and not share any track with M1 and M2 . Kongens Nytorv and Frederiksberg will serve as interchanges between M1 , M2 and M3 + M4 . A two @-@ station branch towards Nordhavn is planned to open in 2019 . A planned expansion towards Sydhavn will include a linkup with Ny Ellebjerg on the S @-@ train network . These stations will also be connected to the regional train network following the completion of the new Copenhagen @-@ <unk> railway . The Sydhavn extension has been approved . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The planning of the metro was spurred by the development of the Ørestad area of Copenhagen . The principle of building a rail transit was passed by the Parliament of Denmark on 24 June 1992 , with the Ørestad Act . The responsibility for developing the area , as well as building and operating the metro , was given to the Ørestad Development Corporation , a joint venture between Copenhagen Municipality ( 45 % ) and the Ministry of Finance ( 55 % ) . Initially , three modes were considered : a tramway , a light rail and a rapid transit . In October 1994 , the Development Corporation chose a light rapid transit . 
 The tram solution would have been a street tram , without any major infrastructure investments in the city centre , such as a dedicated right @-@ of @-@ way . Through Ørestad it would have had level crossings , except for a grade @-@ separated crossing with the European Route E20 and the Øresund Line . It would have had a driver and have operated at about a 150 @-@ second interval — twice the cycle time of the city 's traffic lights . Power would have been provided with overhead wires . Stops were to be located about every 500 m ( 550 yd ) at street level . The articulated trams would have been about 35 m ( 115 ft ) long and have a capacity for 230 passengers . 
 The light rail model would have used the same approach as the tram in Ørestad , but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre . The tunnel sections would be shorter , but the diameter larger because it would have to accommodate overhead wires . The system would have the same frequency as the tram , but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations . The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds , the highest passenger capacity , the lowest visual and noise impact , and the lowest number of accidents . Despite requiring the highest investment , it had the highest net present value . 
 The decision to build stage 2 , from Nørreport to Vanløse , and stage 3 , to the airport , was taken by Parliament on 21 December 1994 . Stage 2 involved the establishment of the company <unk> I / S in February 1995 , owned 70 % by the Ørestad Development Corporation and 30 % by Frederiksberg Municipality . The third stage would be built by <unk> I / S , established in September 1995 and owned 55 % by the Ørestad Development Corporation and 45 % by Copenhagen County . In October 1996 , a contract was signed with the Copenhagen Metro Construction Group ( COMET ) for building the lines ( Civil Works ) , and with Ansaldo STS for delivery of technological systems and trains , and to operate the system the first five years . COMET was a single @-@ purpose consortium composed of Astaldi , <unk> , SAE , <unk> , NCC Rasmussen & <unk> Anlæg and Tarmac Construction . 
 = = = Construction of lines M1 and M2 = = = 
 Construction started in November 1996 , with the moving of underground pipes and wires around the station areas . In August 1997 , work started at the depot , and in September , COMET started the first mainline work . In October and November , the two tunnel boring machines ( TBM ) , christened Liva and Bette , were delivered . They started boring each barrel of the tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998 . The same month , the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro . The section between <unk> and Frederiksberg is a former S @-@ train line , and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998 . 
 The first section of tunnel was completed in September 1998 , and the TBMs moved to <unk> . By December 1998 , work had started on the initial nine stations . Plans for M2 were presented to the public in April 1999 , with a debate emerging if the proposed elevated solution was the best . In May , the first trains were delivered , and trial runs began at the depot . In December , the tunnels were completed to <unk> , and the TBMs were moved to <unk> , where they started to grind towards Frederiksberg . From 1 January 2000 , the S @-@ train service from <unk> to Vanløse was terminated , and work commenced to rebuild the section to metro . The last section of tunnel was completed in February 2001 . 
 In March 2001 , Copenhagen County Council decided to start construction of stage 3 . On 6 November 2001 , the first train operated through a tunnel section . On 28 November , laying of tracks along stage 1 , and stage 2A from Nørreport to Frederiksberg , was completed . An agreement about financing stage 3 was reached on 12 April . By 22 May , the 18 delivered trains had test @-@ run 100 @,@ 000 km ( 62 @,@ 000 miles ) . The section from Nørreport to Lergravsparken and Vestamager was opened on 19 October 2002 . Initially , the system had a 12 @-@ minute headway on each of the two services . From 3 December this was reduced to 9 minutes , and from 19 December to 6 minutes . Operation of the system was subcontracted to Ansaldo , who again subcontracted it to Metro Service , a subsidiary of Serco . The contract had a duration of five years , with an option for extension for another three . 
 = = = Opening of lines M1 and M2 = = = 
 Trial runs on stage 2A began on 24 February 2003 and opened on 29 May . All changes to bus and train schedules in Copenhagen took place on 25 May , but to allow Queen Margrethe II to open the line , the opening needed to be adapted to her calendar . This caused four days without a bus service along the line . Stage 2B , from Frederiksberg to Vanløse , opened on 12 October . 
 Forum Station was nominated for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2005 . On 2 December 2005 , the final agreement to build the City Circle Line was made between the local and national governments . The price was estimated at 11 @.@ 5 to 18 @.@ 3 billion Danish krone ( DKK ) , of which DKK 5 @.@ 4 billion will be financed though ticket sales , and the remaining from the state and municipalities . In 2006 , it was announced that the contract with Ansaldo to operate the metro had been prolonged another three years . However , the subcontract between Ansaldo and Serco Group was not extended , and the contract was instead given to <unk> <unk> <unk> in joint venture with Ansaldo ; they took over operations from October 2007 . The Ørestad Development Corporation was discontinued in 2007 , and the ownership of the metro was transferred to Metroselskabet I / S. 
 In January 2007 , the city council decided that a branch was to be built during construction at Nørrebro , to allow a future branch line from the City Circle Line towards Brønshøj . The first part of this line was intended to be constructed at the same time as the City Circle Line , to avoid a multitude @-@ higher construction cost and long interruptions of operations later . This did not involve a final decision , only an option for future construction . The Herlev / Brønshøj line was ultimately dropped as the City of Copenhagen withdrew its share of the cost of the Nørrebro branch chamber in its 2009 budget , and the state refused to continue the project . Any branch to the Herlev / Brønshøj region would now require a shutdown of the City Circle Line for an extended period of time . 
 In March 2007 , a proposal to establish a station at Valby , where the Carlsberg Group is planning an urban redevelopment , was scrapped . The proposal would have increased construction costs by DKK 900 million and was deemed not economical . The increased cost was , in part , due to an extra TBM being needed to complete the project on time . The City Circle Line was passed by parliament on 1 June 2007 , with only the Red – Green Alliance voting in disfavor . 
 The 4 @.@ 5 km ( 2 @.@ 8 @-@ mile ) stage 3 opened on 28 September 2007 , from Lergravsparken to the airport . It followed , for the most part , the route of the former Amager Line of the Danish State Railways . With this stage complete , the 34 trains were delivered . However , the line caused a heated debate , with several locals organized themselves into the Amager Metro Group . The group argued that the line should have been built underground , citing concerns that it would create noise pollution and a physical barrier in Amager . In April 2008 , the Copenhagen Metro won the award at MetroRail 2008 for the world 's best metro . The jury noted the system 's high regularity , safety and passenger satisfaction , as well as the efficient transport to the airport . During 2008 , the metro experienced a 16 % passenger growth to 44 million passengers per year . 
 An agreement made in September 2008 , the Social Democrats , the Conservative People 's Party , the Liberal Party and the Danish People 's Party agreed to not fund an expansion of the metro northwest . Initially , the system operated trains from 01 : 00 to 05 : 00 only on Thursdays through Saturdays , but , starting on 19 March 2009 , night service was extended to the rest of the week . This caused a logistical challenge , because Metro Service used the nights for maintenance . The routes were therefore set up in such a way that the system could be operated on only a single track , leaving the other free for work . In May 2009 , six companies were pre @-@ qualified to bid for the public service obligation to operate the metro . These were Serco @-@ <unk> , Ansaldo STS , Arriva , S @-@ Bahn Hamburg , Keolis and DSB Metro — a joint venture between DSB and RATP . The process was delayed because of a procedural error by Metroselskabet , who failed to pre @-@ qualify DSB Metro .

 An expansion of the metro , the City Circle Line , is under @-@ construction and scheduled to open in 2019 . Independent of the existing system , it will circle the city center and connect the areas of Østerbro , Nørrebro and <unk> to Frederiksberg and Indre By . The line will be 15 @.@ 5 km ( 9 @.@ 6 miles ) long and run entirely in tunnel . The circle will have 17 stations , two of which are interchanges with both the M1 and M2 lines , and it will take 25 minutes to complete a full circle . Archaeological and geological surveys started in 2007 , preferred bidders were announced in November 2010 and contracts were signed in 2011 . Preparations began by moving utilities etc. in 2010 , and construction of work sites and stations began in 2011 . Drilling of tunnels will begin in 2013 . On 7 January 2011 the new project called <unk> started with the signature by Metroselskabet of new contracts , with Ansaldo Breda and Ansaldo Sts ( Finmeccanica Group ) for the supply of trains and control systems and with an Italian joint @-@ venture led by <unk> <unk> ( about 60 % ) and <unk> ( about 40 % ) with <unk> as third partner for the construction part . In July 2013 , <unk> og <unk> , the environmental appeals board , ruled that the city was wrong to grant Metroselskabet <unk> for 24 @-@ hour work days and noise up to 78 db at the <unk> site . The company is now required to stop work 6PM until a final ruling is made , which could take up to half a year , potentially delaying the completion date . 
 The line will operate as M3 and M4 . The former will run a full circle , while M4 will only operate on the eastern half from Copenhagen Central Station ( <unk> H ) via Østerport to Nørrebro . This solution is temporary , once the metro network has been extended to Nordhavn , the M4 will start at Copenhagen Central Station but leave the City Circle Line at Østerport and service the Nordhavn branch . Later , when the Sydhavn extension has been completed , the M4 will have Ny Ellebjerg as its southern terminus . Trains will operate both ways through the circle . The line will have transfer to M1 and M2 at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv . The line is estimated to carry 240 @,@ 000 daily passengers , bringing the metro 's total daily ridership to 460 @,@ 000 . 
 A northwestern expansion of the City Circle Line was planned , where M4 would divert at Nørrebro and run to the suburbs of Brønshøj and Gladsaxe . This project was abandoned , as the interchange chamber between any such line and the City Circle Line was scrapped as part of the City of Copenhagen 's 2009 budget . In subsequent plans , the northern extension of the M4 has instead been relocated as a Nordhavn branch which will connect with the City Circle Line at Østerport . A Nordhavn line with two stations has been approved by the Danish parliament , and is planned to open in 2019 . The southern extension of the M4 will run from Copenhagen Central Station through Sydhavn to Ny Ellebjerg , where the M4 will link up with the S @-@ train and regional train system . The Danish Transport Authority ( <unk> ) has suggested to convert the F @-@ line of the S @-@ train network to metro standard as an M5 line , but as the only linkup between the M5 and the existing network would be at <unk> Station ( interchange with M1 and M2 ) , this plan is dependent on the approval of a southern extension of the M4 , also providing the M5 with an interchange with the M4 at Ny Ellebjerg Station . 
 The City of Copenhagen has suggested two additional lines M6 and M7 , and a western extension of the M1 or M2 to <unk> has also been suggested . 
 In September 2011 , the local governments in Copenhagen and neighbouring Malmö in Sweden announced that they were seeking European Union funding to study a potential metro line under the Øresund to the neighbourhood of Malmö Central Station , providing faster trips and additional capacity beyond that of the existing Øresund Bridge . The study , for which the EU granted funding in the following December , will consider both a simple shuttle between the two stations and a continuous line integrated with the local transport networks on each side , and they anticipate a travel time of 15 minutes between the two city centers .

 The metro consists of two lines , M1 and M2 . They share a common 7 @.@ 69 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 78 mi ) section from Vanløse to Christianshavn , where they split along two lines : M1 follows the Ørestad Line to Vestamager , while M2 follows the <unk> Line to the airport . The metro consists of a total route length of 20 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 12 @.@ 7 mi ) , and 22 stations , 9 of which are on the section shared by both lines . M1 is 13 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 6 mi ) long and serves 15 stations , while M2 is 14 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 8 mi ) long and serves 16 stations . About 10 km ( 6 miles ) of the lines and 9 stations are in tunnel , located at 20 to 30 m ( 70 to 100 ft ) below ground level . The remaining sections are on embankments , viaducts or at ground level . 
 The section from Vanløse to Frederiksberg follows the Frederiksberg Line , a former S @-@ train line which runs on an embankment . Between <unk> and Frederiksberg , the line runs underground , and continues through the city center . After Christianshavn , the line splits in two . M1 reaches ground level at Islands Brygge , and continues on a viaduct through the Vestamager area . M2 continues in tunnel until after Lergravsparken , where it starts to follow the former Amager Line . 
 The tunnels consist of two parallel barrels ; they run through stable limestone at about 30 m ( 100 ft ) depth , but are elevated slightly at stations . There are emergency exits every 600 m ( 660 yd ) , so that no train is ever further than 300 m ( 330 yd ) away from one . The outer tunnel diameter is 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) , while the inner diameter is 4 @.@ 9 m ( 16 ft ) . The tunnels were excavated by the cut @-@ and @-@ cover method , the New Austrian Tunnelling method and by tunnel boring machines ( TBM ) . Along the elevated sections , the tracks run on alternating sections of separate reinforced concrete viaducts and joint embankments made of reinforced earth .

 The system operates continually ( 24 / 7 ) with a varying headway throughout the day . During rush hour ( 07 : 00 – 10 : 00 and 15 : 00 – 18 : 00 ) , there is a two @-@ minute headway on the common section and a four @-@ minute headway on the single @-@ service sections . During Thursday through Saturday night ( 0 : 00 – 05 : 00 ) , the headway is fifteen minutes , and other nights it is twenty minutes on all sections of the metro . At all other times , there is a three @-@ minute headway on the common section and a six @-@ minute on the split sections . Travel time from Nørreport to Vestamager on M1 is 14 minutes , to the airport on M2 is 15 minutes , and to Vanløse on M1 and M2 is 9 minutes . In 2009 , the metro transported 50 million passengers , or 137 @,@ 000 per day ; by 2013 , the metro 's ridership increased to 55 million . 
 The metro operates with a proof @-@ of @-@ payment system , so riders must have a valid ticket before entering the station platforms . The system is divided into zones , and the fare structure is integrated with other public transport in Copenhagen , including the buses managed by Movia , local DSB trains and the S @-@ train . The system lies within four different zones . Ticket machines are available at all stations , where special tickets for dogs and bicycles can also be purchased . A two @-@ zone ticket costs DKK 24 , and a three @-@ zone ticket DKK 36 , and tickets are good for 60 minutes . Holders of the Copenhagen Card museum pass ride free of charge , as do up to two children under twelve years of age accompanied by an adult . As of 2012 , the metro has fully adapted to the national electronic fare card system <unk> . 
 The system is integrated with other public transport in Copenhagen . There is transfer to the S @-@ train at Vanløse , <unk> and Nørreport , to DSB 's local trains at Nørreport , Ørestad and Lufthavnen , and to Copenhagen Airport at Lufthavnen . There are transfers to Movia bus services at all but four stations . 
 The system is owned by Metroselskabet , who is also responsible for building the City Circle Line . The company is owned by Copenhagen Municipality ( 50 @.@ 0 % ) , the Ministry of Transport ( 41 @.@ 7 % ) and Frederiksberg Municipality ( 8 @.@ 3 % ) . The company is organized with as few employees as possible . Construction and operation is subcontracted through public tenders , while consultants are used for planning . The contract to operate the system was made with Ansaldo STS , who has subcontracted it to Metro Service , a joint venture between them and <unk> <unk> <unk> ( ATM ) , the public transport company of the city of Milan , Italy . The company has about 200 employees , the majority of whom work as stewards . 
 = = Stations = = 
 There are twenty @-@ two stations on the network , of which nine are underground and six are deep @-@ level . They were all designed by <unk> Arkitekter , who created open stations with daylight . Stations have an information column in front , marked with a large ' M ' and featuring information screens . All stations have a vestibule at ground level , which has ticket and local information , ticket machines and <unk> . The stations are built with island platforms and are fully accessible for people with disabilities . 
 The six deep @-@ level stations are built as rectangular , open boxes 60 m ( 200 ft ) long , 20 m ( 66 ft ) wide and 20 m ( 66 ft ) deep . The platforms are located 18 m ( 59 ft ) below the surface . Access to the surface is reached via escalators and elevators . The design allows the stations to be located below streets and squares , allowing the stations to be built without expropriation . Access to the track is blocked by platform screen doors . The underground stations were built as cut @-@ and @-@ cover from the top down ( except Christianshavn , which was excavated as a large hole and the station built bottom @-@ up ) , and the first part of construction was building a water @-@ tight wall on all sides . There are glass pyramids on the roof of the stations permitting daylight to enter . Inside the pyramids , there are prisms reflecting and splitting the light , sometimes resulting in rainbows on the walls . The light in the stations is automatically regulated to make best use of the daylight and maintain a constant level of illumination of the stations at all times . 
 The elevated stations are built in glass , concrete and steel to minimize their visual impact . Outside , there is parking for bicycles , cars , buses and taxis . The platforms are open , but have sheds , and automatic sensors that halt trains if obstacles are detected on the tracks . 
 = = Trains = = 
 The system uses 34 driverless electric multiple units built by AnsaldoBreda and designed by Giugiaro Design of Italy called the AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro . 
 The trains are 39 m ( 128 ft ) long , 2 @.@ 65 m ( 8 ft 8 in ) wide , and weigh 52 tonnes ( 51 long tons ; 57 short tons ) . Each train consists of three articulated cars with a total of six automated , 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 ft 3 in ) wide doors , holding up to 96 seated and 204 standing passengers ( 300 in total ) . There are four large ' flex areas ' in each train with folding seats providing space for wheelchairs , strollers and bicycles . 
 Each car is equipped with two three @-@ phase asynchronous 105 @-@ kilowatt ( 141 hp ) motors , giving each train a power output of 630 kilowatts ( 840 hp ) . In each car , the two motors are fed by the car 's own insulated @-@ gate bipolar transistor . They transform the 750 @-@ volt direct current collected from the third rail shoe to the three @-@ phase alternating current used in the motors . The trains ' top speed are 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) , while the average service speed is 40 km / h ( 25 mph ) , with an acceleration and deceleration capacity of 1 @.@ 3 m / s2 ( 4 @.@ 3 ft / s2 ) along the standard @-@ gauge track . 
 The entire metro system and the trains are run by a fully automated computer system , located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station . The automatic train control ( ATC ) consists of three subsystems : automatic train protection ( ATP ) , automatic train operation ( ATO ) and automatic train supervisory ( ATS ) . The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains ' speed , ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set . The system uses fixed block signaling , except around stations , where moving block signaling is used . 
 The ATO is the autopilot that runs the trains on a predefined schedule , ensures that the trains stop at the station and open the doors . The ATS keeps track of all the components in the network , including the rails and all of the trains in the system , and displays a live schematic at the control center . The ATC is designed so that the ATP is the only safety @-@ critical system , as it would halt the trains if the other systems fail . The safety and signaling specifications are based on the German <unk> , and controlled by <unk> Rheinland and Det Norske Veritas under supervision of the Public Transport Authority . Other aspects of the system , such as power supply , ventilation , security alarms , cameras and pumps , are controlled by a system called " control , regulating and surveillance " . 
 The Control and Maintenance Center is a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ hectare ( 2 @.@ 7 @-@ acre ) facility located at the south end of M1 . It consists of a storage area for trains not in use , a maintenance area and the control facility . Trains operate automatically through the system , and can also automatically be washed on the exterior . The facility has 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) of track , of which 800 m ( 870 yd ) is a test track for use after maintenance . The most common repairs are wheel grinding ; more complicated repairs are made by replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer . By having components in reserve , trains can have shorter maintenance time . The depot also has several maintenance trains , including diesel locomotives that are able to retrieve broken down or disabled trains . 
 At any time , there are four people working at the control center : two monitor the ATC system , one monitors passenger information , and one is responsible for secondary systems , such as power supply . In case of technical problems , there is always a team of linemen that can be dispatched to perform repairs . Although the trains are not equipped with drivers , there are stewards at stations and on some trains that help passengers , perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations .

 " Variable and Full of Perturbation " is the eighth episode of the second season , and the eighteenth episode overall , of the Canadian science fiction television series Orphan Black . It first aired in Canada on Space and the United States on BBC America on 7 June 2014 . The episode was written by Karen Walton and directed by the series ' co @-@ creator John Fawcett . 
 The series focuses on a number of identical human clones , all of whom are played by Tatiana Maslany : Sarah Manning , Alison Hendrix , Cosima Niehaus and Rachel Duncan . This episode introduces a new clone , Tony Sawicki ( Maslany ) , a transgender man whose search for another clone leads him to Sarah 's foster brother Felix Dawkins ( Jordan <unk> ) . Meanwhile , the founder of the cloning program , Professor Ethan Duncan ( Andrew Gillies ) , meets with his adoptive daughter Rachel and attempts to find a cure for Cosima 's illness , while Alison and her husband Donnie ( Kristian Bruun ) attempt to hide a dead body . 
 The show 's co @-@ creators , Fawcett and Graeme Manson , along with Maslany and her hair and makeup artists , developed the character of Tony over a period of six months after deciding that the inclusion of a transgender character would fit well with the show 's themes of identity , gender and sexuality . Overall , the episode received mixed reviews : critics praised Maslany 's performance but found Tony 's character underdeveloped and gimmicky and found the plot disorganised . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode opens with Tony Sawicki rushing his friend Sammy , who has just been shot , to an empty warehouse . Before dying , Sammy implores Tony to find Beth Childs and pass on a message to her . Not knowing that Beth is dead , Tony 's call to Beth 's phone is answered by her former partner , suspended detective Art Bell , who brings Tony to Felix . Realising that Tony is a transgender clone of his foster sister Sarah Manning , Felix ascertains that Tony is unaware of his origins , but refuses to impart any information until Sarah arrives . After Sarah arrives at Felix 's apartment and explains to Tony that they are clones , he is <unk> . He passes on Sammy 's message for Beth , although neither Sarah or Felix understand what it means . Felix gives Tony his , Sarah and Art 's phone numbers and shares a kiss with Tony before he leaves again . 
 Alison Hendrix returns home from rehab to find her husband Donnie drunk and chastises him . When she catches him trying to leave the house in the middle of the night , she persuades him not to give up on their marriage . In an effort to open up to him , she confesses that she played a role in the death of their neighbour Aynsley , and is shocked when Donnie responds by confessing that he accidentally shot and killed Dr. Aldous Leekie , the director of the Dyad Institute , the night before . When Alison asks what he did with Leekie 's body , Donnie leads her to their garage where Leekie 's corpse is wrapped in the trunk of their car . 
 Rachel Duncan , who works for the Dyad Institute , promotes Delphine Cormier to the role formerly held by Leekie , who had been ordered dead when Rachel let him escape the previous night , with the official cover story that he died of a heart attack on a private jet . Rachel sets Delphine the task of convincing Professor Ethan Duncan — a founding scientist of the clone program and Rachel 's adoptive father — to come into Dyad to help find a cure for the illness that has befallen Cosima Niehaus , another clone . When Ethan arrives , Rachel questions him about why she cannot reproduce , and he reveals that all of the clones were intended to be infertile by design . In response , she breaks down in anger and trashes her office . 
 Also working at the Dyad Institute , Cosima refuses to work with her girlfriend and monitor Delphine after Delphine 's recent betrayal . They later reunite and get high in their laboratory together , after which they profess their love for each other . Before Ethan arrives at Dyad to meet Cosima , she confesses to her lab assistant Scott that the clone subject they are researching is in fact herself . Shortly after meeting Ethan , Cosima begins to cough and vomit blood before falling to the ground and seizing .

 The episode introduced Tony Sawicki , a trans man and another clone played by Maslany . The character was first imagined by Manson and Fawcett during the development of the show 's first season ; they thought that introducing a transgender clone character would be " very tied to the themes of our show about identity " and would fit well with the previous season 's themes of gender and sexuality . When they approached Maslany with the idea at the end of the first season , she told them that she had already thought about playing a transgender character herself . It took the show 's creators longer than with any other character to develop and refine Tony 's personality and wardrobe , the entire process taking six months . In preparation for the part , Maslany researched and met with transgender people and grew out her underarm hair for six weeks , although she eventually had to shave her underarms to attend an awards ceremony before the episode was filmed . The new character was kept secret from most of the crew until scripts for the episode were distributed , and the show 's hair and makeup department trialled different looks for Tony on Maslany 's days off and weekends so that other members of the crew would not see her in Tony 's costume . Tony 's final look was created by Stephen Lynch , Sandy Sokolowski and Debra Hanson , in the show 's makeup , hair and wardrobe departments , respectively . Manson , Fawcett and Maslany sought advice from GLAAD on how to best go about introducing a transgender character . In response to the perception that Tony 's introduction had created " a minefield of sexual politics " , Fawcett said that that had not been the writers ' intention ; rather , their aim was to " just throw this character in there and treat them like a normal human being like we would anyone else on the show " . 
 Unlike most other episodes , the scenes which featured multiple clones were filmed using traditional locked @-@ off cameras rather than the time @-@ consuming <unk> camera set @-@ up . The episode featured the longest continuous shot filmed in Orphan Black , where a scene between Felix , Tony and Sarah was filmed in one take . It took almost three days to film the 15 @-@ second sequence of Scott drilling into Kira 's tooth , involving three rented cameras and a prop tooth that was painted red inside and filled with white dust to achieve the desired effect when drilled into . The scene in which Cosima and Delphine use a <unk> to get high was mostly improvised by Maslany and Brochu ; instead of inhaling actual helium , the pitch of their voices was altered in post @-@ production . A stunt double was used for the second @-@ to @-@ last scene , wherein Cosima falls to the ground after vomiting blood . 
 The episode features Cosima and her lab assistant Scott playing the board game <unk> . Fawcett , who describes himself as " a massive board game fan " , contacted the game 's creators at Fantasy Flight Games for permission to use <unk> in the show and employed one of his friends as a consultant for the episode . As a consultant , his friend set up the board for the scene , taught the involved actors how to play the game , checked for accuracy of the gameplay and dialogue about the game , and had a non @-@ speaking cameo appearance in the scene as one of the board game players . Manson chose to incorporate H. G. Wells ' science fiction novel The Island of Doctor Moreau , which Ethan Duncan reads to Kira , into the episode since he felt that the novel 's themes " run so deep in our show " . The book cover featured in the episode was designed by the show 's art department . The episode 's title , " Variable and Full of Perturbation " , is taken from a quote from Francis Bacon 's philosophical work Novum Organum : " the spirit of man ( according as it is meted out to different individuals ) is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation , and governed as it were by chance . "

 The episode was aired in the United States on 7 June 2014 on BBC America . It was watched by 576 @,@ 000 viewers and was the 14th most @-@ watched program of the night . It ranked ninth for the night in the key demographic of viewers aged 18 – 49 , with a Nielsen rating of 0 @.@ 27 . 
 " Variable and Full of Perturbation " received mixed reviews from critics . Mark <unk> , writing for Paste , gave the episode a rating of 6 @.@ 9 out of 10 and , despite enjoying several storylines , described the introduction of Tony as " perhaps the biggest misstep in the show 's brief history " . He felt that the kiss between Tony and Felix was an example of " taboo @-@ pushing gimmickry " and summarised the episode as " strange experimental tangent " . Slant Magazine critic Matt Brennan found the episode " jumbled and strange " but felt that the introduction of Tony was a " delightful twist " . He said that Cosima 's storyline taking place at the Dyad Institute felt " dry and utilitarian , as though the writers realized they better get their shit together in time to wrap things up " .

Club 's Caroline Framke gave the episode a C – grade and criticised the " chaotic script " , " aggressively flashy direction " and the failed attempts to integrate the " wildly different " subplots . She admired the attempt to " shin [ e ] a light on a population that 's often invisible in the media landscape " by introducing a transgender character , but thought that Tony 's character was underdeveloped and " more like a prop than a character " . Similarly , Adam W. Kepler of The New York Times felt that Tony was a cliché of trans men — " absolutely nothing [ viewers ] haven 't seen before " — whose characterisation was overly simplistic . 
 Although Chris <unk> of The Huffington Post found Tony 's character dull , he wrote in response to Maslany 's portrayal of him : " Gift @-@ wrap that Golden Globe , Hollywood Foreign Press . There are no other Best TV Actress contenders this year . " He praised the " touching " scenes shared by Cosima with Delphine and Scott and the " entertaining and twisted " bonding between Alison and Donnie . IGN 's Eric Goldman felt that introducing Tony was a " big leap " for the show but that it paid off , largely due to Maslany 's performance , and enjoyed the storylines featuring Alison , Cosima and Rachel . Vlada Gelman wrote for TVLine that Maslany 's performance as Tony in " Variable and Full of Perturbation " was proof that " there [ isn 't ] anything Tatiana Maslany can 't do " . Conversely , Rob Hunter of Film School Rejects felt that her portrayal of Tony provided " proof that Maslany is human after all and capable of failure " .

 Meddle is the sixth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd , released on 31 October 1971 by Harvest Records . It was produced between the band 's touring commitments , from January to August 1971 . The album was recorded at a series of locations around London , including Abbey Road Studios and Morgan Studios . 
 With no material to work with and no clear idea of the album 's direction , the group devised a series of novel experiments which eventually inspired the album 's signature track , " Echoes " . Although many of the band 's later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics written mainly by Roger Waters , Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each member , and is considered a transitional album between the Syd Barrett @-@ influenced group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd . The cover , incorporating a close @-@ up shot of an ear underwater was , as with several previous albums , designed by Hipgnosis , though Storm Thorgerson was unhappy with the final result . 
 The album was well received by music critics upon its release . However , despite being commercially successful in the United Kingdom , lackluster publicity on the part of their United States @-@ based label led to poor sales there upon initial release . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Returning from a series of tours across America and England in support of Atom Heart Mother , at the start of 1971 Pink Floyd commenced work on new material at Abbey Road Studios in London . At the time , Abbey Road was equipped only with eight @-@ track multitrack recording facilities , which the band found insufficient for the increasing technical demands of their project . They transferred their best efforts , including the opening of what became " Echoes " , to 16 @-@ track tape at smaller studios in London ( namely AIR , and Morgan in West Hampstead ) and resumed work with the advantage of more flexible recording equipment . Engineers John Leckie and Peter Bown recorded the main Abbey Road and AIR sessions , while for minor work at Morgan , Rob Black , Wayne Gregory and Roger Quested handled the engineering duties . 
 Lacking a central theme for the project , the band used several experimental methods in an attempt to spur the creative process . One exercise involved each member playing on a separate track , with no reference to what the other members were doing . The tempo was entirely random while the band played around an agreed chord structure , and moods such as " first two minutes romantic , next two up tempo " . Each recorded section was named , but the process was largely unproductive ; after several weeks , no complete songs had been created . 
 Leckie had worked on albums such as George Harrison 's All Things Must Pass and Ringo Starr 's Sentimental Journey , and was employed as a tape @-@ operator on Meddle , partly for his proclivity for working into the early hours of the morning . He has said that Pink Floyd 's sessions would often begin in the afternoon , and end early the next morning , " during which time nothing would get done . There was no record company contact whatsoever , except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints . " The band would apparently spend long periods of time working on simple sounds , or a particular guitar riff . They also spent several days at AIR attempting to create music using a variety of household objects , a project which would be revisited between their next albums , The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here . 
 Following these early experiments – called Nothings – the band developed Son of Nothings , which was followed by Return of the Son of Nothings – the working title of the new album . One of these early works involved the use of Richard Wright 's piano . Wright had fed a single note through a Leslie speaker , producing a submarine @-@ like ping . The band tried repeatedly to recreate this sound in the studio but were unsuccessful , and so the demo version was used on what would later become " Echoes " , mixed almost exclusively at AIR Studios . Combined with David Gilmour 's guitar , the band were able to develop the track further , experimenting with accidental sound effects ( such as Gilmour 's guitar being plugged into a wah @-@ wah pedal back to front ) . Unlike with Atom Heart Mother , the new multi @-@ track capabilities of the studio enabled them to create the track in stages , rather than performing it in a single take . The final , 23 @-@ minute piece would eventually take up the entire second side of the album . 
 " One of These Days " was developed around an ostinato bassline created by Roger Waters , by feeding the output through a Binson Echorec . The bass line was performed by Waters and Gilmour using two bass guitars , one on old strings . Drummer Nick Mason 's abstruse " One of these days I 'm going to cut you into little pieces " line was recorded at double speed using a falsetto voice , and replayed at normal speed . 
 Meddle was recorded between the band 's various concert commitments , and therefore its production was spread over a considerable period of time . The band recorded in the first half of April 1971 , but in the latter half played at Doncaster and Norwich before returning to record at the end of the month . In May they split their time between sessions at Abbey Road , and rehearsals and concerts in London , Lancaster , Stirling , Edinburgh , Glasgow and Nottingham . June and July were spent mainly performing at venues across Europe . August was spent in the far east and Australia , September in Europe , and October to November in the US . In the same period , the group also produced Relics , a compilation album of some of Pink Floyd 's earlier works . A quadraphonic mix of the album was prepared at Command Studios on 21 and 26 September , but remains unreleased . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Although the tracks possess a variety of moods , Meddle is generally considered more cohesive than its 1970 predecessor , Atom Heart Mother . The largely instrumental " One of These Days " is followed by " A Pillow of Winds " , which is distinguished by being one of the few quiet , acoustic love songs in the Pink Floyd catalogue . These two songs segue into each other across windy sound effects , anticipating the technique that would later be used on Wish You Were Here . The title of " A Pillow of Winds " was inspired by the games of Mahjong that Waters , Mason , and their wives , played while in the south of France . 
 The song " Fearless " employs field recordings of the Liverpool F.C. Kop choir singing " You 'll Never Walk Alone " , their anthem , which brings the song to an end in a heavily reverberated fade @-@ out . " San Tropez " , by contrast , is a jazz @-@ inflected pop song with a shuffle tempo , composed by Waters in his increasingly deployed style of breezy , off @-@ the @-@ cuff songwriting . The song was inspired by the band 's trip to the south of France in 1970 . Pink Floyd uncharacteristically displayed their sense of humour with " Seamus " , a pseudo @-@ blues novelty track featuring Steve Marriott 's dog ( which Gilmour was looking after ) howling along to the music . " Seamus " often tops polls as the worst song Pink Floyd ever created , but the band would later use animal sounds again , in Animals . 
 The final song on the album is the 23 @-@ minute " Echoes " . First performed as " Return of the Son of Nothing " on 22 April 1971 in Norwich , the band spent about six months on the track in three studios ( Morgan , AIR and Abbey Road ) . The track opens with Wright 's " ping " . " Echoes " was recorded almost entirely at Air Studios , and completed in July 1971 . " Echoes " also gave its name to the compilation album Echoes : The Best of Pink Floyd , on which a much @-@ edited version of the title track was included . On the compilation , multiple edits throughout the entire song cut the running length of the piece down by some seven minutes . Some of the material composed during the creation of Meddle was not used ; however , one song would eventually become " Brain Damage " , on The Dark Side of the Moon . " Echoes " was later featured in its entirety in the 1973 Australian surf film Crystal Voyager , filmed , written and narrated by surfer , photographer and filmmaker George Greenough during an extended section of slow @-@ motion footage shot inside the curl of waves . 
 = = Packaging = = 
 The album 's title Meddle is a play on words : a medal , and to interfere . Storm Thorgerson of the art @-@ design group Hipgnosis originally suggested a close @-@ up shot of a baboon 's anus for the album cover photograph . He was overruled by the band , who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in Japan that they would rather have " an ear underwater " . The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling . The image represents an ear , underwater , collecting waves of sound ( represented by ripples in the water ) . Thorgerson has expressed dissatisfaction with the cover , claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve : " I think Meddle is a much better album than its cover " . Thorgerson 's colleague Aubrey Powell shares his sentiments , saying : " Meddle was a mess . I hated that cover . I don 't think we did them justice with that at all ; it 's half @-@ hearted . " The gatefold contains a group photograph of the band ( Floyd 's last until 1987 's A Momentary Lapse of Reason ) .

 Meddle was released on 31 October 1971 in the US , and 13 November in the UK . Meddle was later released as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab , and in April 1989 on their " Ultradisc " gold CD format . The album was included as part of the box set Shine On on 2 November 1992 . 
 Although in the UK it reached number three , lacklustre publicity on the part of Capitol Records led to weak sales in the US , and a chart position of number 70 . On 29 November 1971 , " One of These Days " was released as a 7 @-@ inch single in the US , with " Fearless " on the B @-@ side . " One of These Days " and " Echoes " were performed during Live At Pompeii ( the latter in two parts ) and also on the BBC 's 1971 In Concert . Meddle was later certified gold by the RIAA on 29 October 1973 and then double platinum on 11 March 1994 , following the added attention garnered by the band 's later successes in the United States . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 On release , Meddle received generally positive reviews from music critics . Rolling Stone 's Jean @-@ Charles Costa wrote : " Meddle not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour 's emergence as a real shaping force with the group , it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again " , and the NME called it " an exceptionally good album " . Steve Peterson of Hit Parader cited " Fearless " as its best song and said of the album , " This has got to be their best ever . " Ed Kelleher of Circus called it " another masterpiece by a masterful group " , noting " Fearless " as " fascinating " and praising " Echoes " as " a tone poem that allows all four group members much time to stretch their muscles " . However , Melody Maker was more reserved , describing it as " a soundtrack to a non @-@ existent movie " . 
 In a retrospective review , Robert Christgau said Meddle was a fairly good progression over the group 's previous work and featured folk songs highlighted by unique melodies , although he lamented the lyrics to " A Pillow of Winds " : " The word ' behold ' should never cross their filters again " . In his critique of " Echoes " , he believed the lyrics imitate " Across the Universe " by the Beatles but over 23 minutes of music that flows with a " timeless calm " similar to " Interstellar Overdrive " . Daryl Easlea of BBC felt it is a similar , but more consistent and tuneful version of Atom Heart Mother highlighted by " Echoes " , which he said " dominates the entire work " and is " everything right about progressive rock ; engaging , intelligent and compelling " . In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , Rob Sheffield said " Echoes " showed Pink Floyd to be a more developed group than before , " coloring the slow guitar ripples with deep @-@ in @-@ the @-@ studio sonic details that only the truly baked would notice , much less appreciate . " Writing for AllMusic , editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Meddle the best album from their transitional years leading up to The Dark Side of the Moon , as it " spends most of its time with sonic textures and elongated compositions , most notably on its epic closer , ' Echoes ' " . He noted a " uniform tone " , but not song structure , and wrote of the album 's significance in the group 's catalogue : " Pink Floyd were nothing if not masters of texture , and Meddle is one of their greatest excursions into little details , pointing the way to the measured brilliance of Dark Side of the Moon and the entire Roger Waters era .

 The Hideous Sun Demon ( sometimes billed as The Sun Demon , or in the UK as Blood on His Lips ) is a 1958 science fiction horror film written , directed and produced by Robert Clarke , who also starred in the film . It also stars Patricia Manning , Nan Peterson , Patrick Whyte and Fred La Porta . The film focuses on a scientist ( portrayed by Clarke ) who is exposed to a radioactive isotope and soon finds out that it comes with horrifying consequences . 
 The film was inspired by the financial success of The Astounding She @-@ Monster in which Clarke had starred . The film 's crew was made up of University of Southern California film students , and the film 's cast were either unknowns or Clarke 's family and friends . The film was shot during 12 consecutive weekends and was shot by three different cinematographers . Originally budgeted at $ 10 @,@ 000 , it ended up costing $ 50 @,@ 000 . The Hideous Sun Demon premiered on August 29 , 1958 as part of a double bill with Roger Corman 's Attack of the Crab Monsters . The film received mostly negative reviews upon its release , but has since become a cult film and has been referenced and parodied many times . An unauthorized sequel , the 1965 short film Wrath of the Sun Demon , was produced by Donald F. Glut . Two redubbed versions of the original film have been released : the comedic Hideous Sun Demon : Special Edition and What 's Up , Hideous Sun Demon ( also known as Revenge of the Sun Demon ) , the latter of which was produced with Clarke 's permission . 
 = = Plot = = 
 When research scientist Dr. Gilbert " Gil " McKenna ( Clarke ) falls unconscious after accidentally being exposed to radiation during an experiment with a new radioactive isotope , he is rushed to a nearby hospital . Attending physician Dr. Stern ( Robert Garry ) is surprised to find that Gil shows no signs of burns typical for five @-@ minute exposure to radiation and informs Gil 's co @-@ workers , lab assistant Ann Russell ( Patricia Manning ) and scientist Dr. Frederick Buckell ( Patrick Whyte ) , that he will keep the patient under observation for several days . 
 Later , Gil is taken to a solarium to receive the sun 's healing rays . While he naps , he transforms into a reptilian creature , horrifying the other patients . Fleeing from the scene , Gil discovers his new appearance . Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident , theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused a reversal of evolution , transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight . Stern suggests that Gil can control his symptoms by staying in the dark and remaining in the hospital , but admits that the patient cannot be held against his will . 
 Having reverted to normal , a disconsolate Gil notifies Ann of his resignation . Confining himself to his house and only coming out at night , Gil spends his hours drinking and wandering aimlessly around the grounds of his estate . He later drives to a bar where sultry piano player Trudy Osborne ( Nan Peterson ) is performing . 
 Buckell soon receives word that noted radiation @-@ poisoning specialist Dr. Jacob Hoffman ( Fred La Porta ) has agreed to help Gil and plans on arriving in the area within a few days . When radiation poisoning studies offer no leads on solving Gil 's own particular symptoms , the distraught scientist contemplates suicide , but soon changes his mind . Instead , Gil returns to the bar where Trudy joins him for a drink and comments that the evening is not over because it is " never late until the sun comes up . " Although Gil is disturbed by the comment , his loneliness draws him closer to her . When bar patron George insinuates that he has purchased Trudy 's company for the evening , Gil defends her , causing a fight between the two men . After knocking George unconscious , Gil flees with Trudy into the night . Later that evening , after walking the shoreline , they make love , falling asleep in the sand until the morning light awakens Gil . Horrified , Gil flees in his car leaving Trudy stranded on the beach . Arriving at the house , Gil runs in , but not before the transformation occurs . 
 Ann soon arrives , discovering Gil cowering in the cellar in a state of shock . Believing that he is beyond help , Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman , but after Ann 's tearful pleading , Gil reluctantly agrees . During the examination , Dr. Hoffman orders Gil to remain in the house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help . Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy , Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang . Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy , having felt sorry for him , brought him home to her apartment . George soon arrives and , upon seeing Gil , forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight . Transforming into the creature , Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills . Returning to the house , Gil finds Ann , Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his normal human state . A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder , with the others assuring him that he acted in self @-@ defense , but when the police arrive with an arrest warrant , the hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer . 
 Hiding inside an oil field shack while police comb the area and set up roadblocks , Gil is discovered by young Suzy who offers to fetch him cookies . Hurrying back to her house , Suzy is caught hoarding cookies by her mother and is forced to reveal who they are for . While her mother calls the police , Suzy slips out of the door to return to Gil . Her mother chases after her into the oil field , and police cars soon arrive . Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him , Gil carries the girl out of the shack into the sunlight where he lets her go . He soon transforms into the creature . In the ensuing police chase , Gil slaughters one of the officers and then climbs the stairs to the top of a tall natural gas tank , where the remaining officer chases after him . As Gil begins to strangle him , the officer shoots Gil in the neck . Mortally wounded , the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell , Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay .

 Development for The Hideous Sun Demon began after the 1957 release of The Astounding She @-@ Monster , a science fiction film starring Clarke . In his contract for the film , Clarke was promised five percent of She @-@ Monster 's profits in addition to his salary . Although Clarke later admitted that the film was awful , it was a financial success , with Clarke receiving a sizable sum from the film 's box office returns . Inspired by that film 's financial success , Clarke decided to direct his own low @-@ budget science fiction film . According to Clarke , the story for the film was inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson 's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , which dealt with multiple personalities . Clarke and co @-@ writer / director Tom Boutross ( although some sources , including Clarke himself , say his friend Phil Hiner co @-@ wrote the first draft ) wrote the first draft of the screenplay , then @-@ titled Saurus or <unk> , names taken from the Latin word meaning " reptile " . Other working titles for the film included Strange Pursuit and Terror in the Sun . Boutross , who is also credited as one of the film 's co @-@ directors , later edited films like Rat Fink ( 1965 ) , A Man Called Dagger ( 1967 ) and 1974 hit The Legend of Boggy Creek . The first draft of the script was significantly different from what would be shown in the finished film . The original storyline centered on an explorer and a female lawyer searching for uranium in the country of Guatemala . While there , they are tormented by a man who had been mutated by experiments conducted on him by his scientist father , who is an expert in radiation , and when the young man is exposed to the sun , he transforms into a reptilian creature . 
 The film 's crew consisted of students from the University of Southern California . Clarke pitched the story idea to Robin Kirkman , a student at USC , who liked the idea . The two men formed the production company Clarke @-@ King Enterprises , and Kirkman worked as the film 's associate producer . E.S. Seely , who later directed the 1961 film Shangri @-@ La , wrote the final draft of the film 's screenplay , which was then rewritten by Doane Hoag who " polished the dialogue " , according to Clarke . The film was initially budgeted at $ 10 @,@ 000 , but by the end of production , it had cost $ 50 @,@ 000 in total . The film was Clarke 's first and only effort as writer or director . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Clarke , the film 's director , writer and producer , also starred in the lead role of Dr. Gilbert McKenna . A veteran actor , he wanted his character to seem realistic and multi @-@ dimensional , with both bad and good qualities . " I acted the part as if I wouldn 't let anything get in my way " , Clarke later recalled . The rest of the cast consisted mostly of aspiring actors and actresses from around USC , with some characters played by Clarke 's friends and family . Actress Nan Peterson , in her acting debut , was cast in the role of Trudy Osborne because of her voluptuous figure , according to Clarke . Originally , singer Marilyn King of The King Sisters , who was Clarke 's sister @-@ in @-@ law , was cast for the role , but she dropped out due to her pregnancy at the time of production . King , however , did write and perform the song " Strange Pursuit " , featured in the bar scene in the film , providing the vocals for Peterson 's character . Peterson had previously worked as a model for Catalina Bathing Suits and was touring nationwide as " Miss Vornado " for the Vornado air conditioning company . <unk> Conkling , who played the little girl who befriends McKenna in the film , was actually the daughter of Clarke 's wife 's sister . Pearl Driggs , who portrayed an old woman on the hospital roof , was Clarke 's mother @-@ in @-@ law . A radio announcer heard in the film was played by Clarke 's sister @-@ in @-@ law 's fiance , and Clarke 's nephew played a newsboy in the film . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The Hideous Sun Demon was shot during 12 consecutive weekends on rented equipment . At the time of production , Clarke was busy acting in other films during weekdays while the student film crew attended school . A decision to film during the weekends was made , since it was the only time that both Clarke and the crew were free . The cast and crew were paid $ 25 per day . Due to the film 's low budget , items such as clothing and make @-@ up were provided by the film 's stars themselves . " I had to do my own make @-@ up , [ and ] use my own clothes ... it was a very low @-@ budget film " , Peterson later recalled . The film was shot by three different cinematographers , all credited at the end of the film : John Morrill , who Clarke later stated shot at least half the film ; <unk> <unk> , who also shot <unk> and the 1966 horror film Queen of Blood before working on bigger projects like Newman 's Law ( 1974 ) , Capone ( 1975 ) and Kiss Daddy Goodbye ( 1981 ) ; and Stan Follis , in his only film credit . 
 The film was one of the first to use practical locations during shooting . According to Clarke , " When we needed a scene in a bar , we went to Santa Monica and asked a guy how much money he would charge to let us come in and shoot scenes in his bar " . Because Clarke also acted in the film , editor and co @-@ writer Tom Boutross served as co @-@ director . Boutross later The main character 's home in the film was located on Lafayette Boulevard in Los Angeles , which is no longer standing . The four @-@ story rooming house was rented for 5 – 6 weekend days for $ 25 per day . The exterior shots of the character 's house were shot in a different location around Glendale Hill . A scene in the film where a transformed McKenna graphically crushes a rat with his bare hands was not in the script , and was improvised while on location . The effect was accomplished by placing ketchup on the rat ; Clarke would then gently squeeze the rat , making the ketchup ooze from his fingers . This scene was removed from prints that were released on television , but was later restored . 
 Coastal scenes were filmed at Bass Rock and near <unk> , while other scenes were filmed near Signal Hill . The film 's climax was filmed around the area of the Union Station train depot . The large gas tank , which stood over 300 feet tall , was made available to the cast and crew by the Southern California Gas Company . Filming at this location proved to be a challenge , as the cast and crew had trouble communicating with each other , with Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure . 
 The title monster was designed by production designer Richard <unk> , who created the suit for $ 500 , and was built over a diver 's wetsuit . Conditions inside the suit were very hot ; combined with the humid weather , this caused Clarke , who performed his own stunts in the film , to sweat profusely . The original mask is currently owned by archivist and occasional actor Bob Burns . <unk> later worked as production designer for the 1958 film Hell Squad , and also was responsible for designing the sea creature costume in the science fiction film Destination Inner Space ( 1966 ) .

 Clarke initially had no distribution deals set up for the film . Clarke 's brother – a sales manager at an Amarillo , Texas , television station – put him into contact with the owner of several local drive @-@ in theaters . Clarke agreed to premiere his film in Amarillo , and it played on a double bill with the Roger Corman film Attack of the Crab Monsters , under the alternate title The Sun Demon , on August 29 , 1958 . Peterson and Clarke appeared at the premiere , and , after the film , performed an interview together . While the audience was distracted , Clarke changed into his costume and made an appearance as the Sun Demon . After this success , Clarke declined a distribution deal with American International Pictures and instead chose a competitor , Miller @-@ Consolidated Pictures , who distributed it across the US and UK . Clarke made additional appearances as the Sun Demon . However , 18 months after the company started distributing the film , it went bankrupt . Because of this , Clarke never saw any income from the deal . Clarke later sold off the films rights to various distributors . In the United Kingdom , the film was distributed by <unk> and released with the title Blood on His Lips .

 = = Reception = = 
 Critical reception for The Hideous Sun Demon has been mostly negative . In a contemporary review , the Monthly Film Bulletin gave the film a negative review , saying that " wordy dialogue , poor acting , uneven photography and sub @-@ standard sound all add to the disadvantage of a hopelessly illogical plot " . 
 Bob Stephens of the San Francisco Chronicle , in a 2000 review , criticized the film 's narrative slightness and Peter <unk> 's casting , but also wrote that he " must confess that I enjoy Demon . Its naivete is a more reliable pathway to wonder than the cynicism and condescension of contemporary fantasy films could ever be " . TV Guide gave the film a negative review , awarding it 1 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars and calling it " laughable " , but also commented that the monster costume was good . Leonard Maltin gave the film a negative review , panning the film 's production values , calling it " hideous " . In his book The Encyclopedia of Monsters , author Jeff Rovin called it " a clever twist on the Wolfman theme " and an " effective and gritty film [ that ] boasts an excellent monster costume " . Allmovie gave the film a positive review , calling it " a staple of TV horror programming since the early 1960s " and praising the film 's claustrophobic feel , editing and actor / director Clarke 's performance as the lead character , while criticizing the film 's stock characters and " clunky " dialogue . In Cult Horror Films , Welch D. Everman wrote that the film expresses traditional 1950s themes : a warning about the dangers of nonconformity and a mixed message about nuclear energy . Chris Barsanti wrote in The Sci @-@ Fi Movie Guide that the film distinguishes itself from other 1950s radioactive monster films by being an allegory for alcoholism . The film has developed a cult following over the years since its release .

 In 1965 , seven years after the release of the original film , a student short film serving as an unauthorized sequel was made by amateur filmmaker Don Glut , after he discovered the Sun Demon mask in Bob Burns ' collection . Filmed in black and white with a running time of three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes , Wrath of the Sun Demon starred Burns as the Sun Demon . The short film was made with the support of the University of Southern California , where Glut was a student at the time . The plot centered on a man ( presumably McKenna ) transforming into the Sun Demon and terrorizing several people before falling to his death off a cliff . The film also starred John Schuyler as the film 's hero and Burns ' wife Kathy . 
 Burns and his wife had been friends with Schuyler before production of the film . According to Glut , Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did not want it to get soiled or damaged during production . During the fight scene , in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it , Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder . When the time came for the film 's climax , where the Sun Demon fell to his death off a cliff , neither Burns nor Glut wanted to do the stunt , and neither wanted to damage the mask by putting it on a dummy . So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon , and Glut then shot the figure in slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley . The original film 's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post @-@ production , with Glut 's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon 's voice .

 Two redubbed versions of the film have been released .

Unlike the original film , this version , which is not listed on IMDb , was intended to be a comedy . 
 Writing for Cinefantastique , David J. Hogan described plans for the original footage to be redubbed using a new screenplay written by Mark and Allan <unk> , with Clarke 's character Gil renamed Ishmael <unk> . This version was to center on <unk> , whose formula for an oral suntan lotion transforms the hapless scientist into a monster . Salem and Brown were inspired by Woody Allen 's redubbing of the 1965 Japanese spy thriller film Kokusai <unk> <unk> : Kagi no <unk> , which Allen then transformed into his directorial debut comedy film , What 's Up , Tiger Lily ? . The resulting redubbing was titled What 's Up , Hideous Sun Demon ( also known as Revenge of the Sun Demon ) , which was released with the original director 's permission . Salem and Brown were not credited as the producers in this version , which was produced by Jeffrey A. Montgomery and written by Craig Mitchell . New footage for this version was shot with Clarke 's son Cam along with <unk> Gress , Mark Holton and Susan Tyrell . Actor and talk show host Jay Leno provided the uncredited voice for McKenna . 
 What 's Up , Hideous Sun Demon was featured in an episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Image Entertainment released this film on DVD twice in 2003 , first by itself on July 15 , and later as a double feature with The Hideous Sun Demon on December 30 .

 Clips from The Hideous Sun Demon appeared in the film It Came from Hollywood , while part of the film 's soundtrack was used during the cemetery chase scene in Night of the Living Dead . The film appeared on Elvira 's Movie Macabre , a television series in which the title character comments on the films that are shown , and the screenplay for the film was published as Scripts from the Crypt : The Hideous Sun Demon by BearManor on May 1 , 2011 . The band Hideous Sun Demons were named after the film . A modeling kit of the Sun Demon character was released by Resin from the Grave in 1988 , sculpted by Fred <unk> . 
 = Iridomyrmex = 
 Iridomyrmex , or the rainbow ant ( referring to its blue @-@ green iridescent sheen ) is a genus of ant first described by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862 . He placed it in the subfamily Dolichoderinae of the family Formicidae . There are 79 described species and five fossil species . Most of these ants are native to Australia ; others are found in several countries and islands in Asia and other areas in Oceania , and they have been introduced to Brazil , New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates . Fossil species are known from China , France and the United States . 
 These ants are known to be an ecologically dominant and important group of ants , but they are sometimes regarded as pests because they disturb soil and enter human houses . Farmers in rural Australia place animal carcasses on meat ant ( I. purpureus ) mounds as a method of disposing of them ; meat ants will consume the carcass and reduce it to bones in a matter of weeks . Meat ants also engage in ritualised fighting which helps prevent casualties and solve territorial disputes between neighbouring colonies . The largest members of this genus are those of the I. purpureus species group , measuring 8 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) . 
 After their nuptial flight , queen ants may establish a colony by themselves , by budding or cooperatively , where a subset of the colony migrates to a new location or when multiple queens help find a suitable nesting spot , but they will display intolerance to each other when workers are present . The eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop into adults . The genus lives in a wide variety of habitats and nests in soil in numbers that range from a couple of hundred individuals to over 300 @,@ 000 in a single colony . Depending on the species , nests are large mounds covered in pebbles with multiple entrances while others live above ground in twig nests . In some cases , ants dwell in several nest sites connected by paths ; some of these nests can extend to 650 metres ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) in length . Some species associate with caterpillars and butterflies that provide the ants with secretions and honeydew , and I. bicknelli <unk> orchids . These ants are predators and scavengers ; they hunt for prey to feed their young . Notably , these ants are immune to the toxins of the cane toad and feed on the juveniles . Predators such as spiders , birds , lizards , and other ants prey on Iridomyrmex ants . 
 = = Phylogeny = = 
 The separation of the genus Iridomyrmex from its most recent common ancestor began around 12 million years ago . Its sister group , <unk> , has only two species , even though both genera are the same age . In comparison to other Indo @-@ Australian genera in the subfamily Dolichoderinae , the clade of which it is a part is 23 million years old , meaning that it is rather young . However , the fossil species that have been found are from the Eocene and Oligocene . The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic position of Iridomyrmex among the Indo @-@ Australian genera : 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The genus Iridomyrmex was first described by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862 , but it had no designated type species until 1903 . By then , the type species was designated as Formica <unk> , a synonym of Iridomyrmex purpureus . The genus was placed in the subfamily Dolichoderinae in 1878 , the same year the subfamily was established . Since the establishment of the genus , it suffered taxonomic misunderstanding due to the gradual development of unrelated ants being designated into the genus by early researchers who failed to identify easily recognisable features that would make them distinct from the genus Iridomyrmex . 
 <unk> William Brown , Jr . , was perhaps the first person to question the monophyly of the genus , mentioning that the Argentine ant , a former member of Iridomyrmex , differed from the rest of the genus . The first proper revisions of the genus began in the 1990s , and 91 species were transferred to six genera ; only 62 species remained after these revisions . These species were placed into the genera Anonychomyrma , <unk> , Linepithema , Ochetellus , <unk> and <unk> . In 2011 , the genus was revised again , and 79 species and five extinct species were now present , 31 of which were newly described . Four species were placed in different genera while 25 species and subspecies were classified as synonyms . According to one source , 350 Australian Iridomyrmex species may be present . 
 The scientific name of the genus , Iridomyrmex , meaning " rainbow ant " , refers to their blue @-@ green iridescent sheen . The word <unk> , meaning " rainbow " , derives from Ancient Greek , and myrmex , another Greek word , means " ant " . 
 = = = Species = = = 
 [ extinct species are marked with † ] 
 = = Description = = 
 Unlike other genera in Dolichoderinae , the front margin of the clypeus is not below the mandibles ; instead , it is located above them . The eyes are located on top of the ants ' head , and they are noticeably distant from the mandibles . These ants range from small to medium ; members of the I. conifer species group measure 4 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) , being reddish @-@ brown in colour with a distinctive propodeum , while members of the I. purpureus species group are the largest at 8 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) . Worker castes are rarely polymorphic . 
 Based on observations , Iridomyrmex workers can be deformed when they are born . For example , a captured specimen had its propodeum and gaster fused together , and the petiole was still present but enlarged . Despite the deformity , the worker was still able to forage with little trouble . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Ants of this genus are found in many countries and islands , spanning several continents . In the Oceanian region , these ants are found in Fiji , Indonesia , New Caledonia , Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands . In Australia , they are found in every state and territory . In New Zealand , this genus has been introduced to the country , establishing themselves in both the North Island and South Island . In Asia , they are found in Burma , East Timor , India , Malaysia and the Philippines . I. anceps is the only known ant of this genus present in the Middle East , having been introduced to the United Arab Emirates . I. <unk> was introduced to Brazil through human activity . Populations are present on the islands of Norfolk Island and Phillip Island in Oceania . Extinct species were native to countries beyond the modern distribution of the genus ; fossils have been found in China , France and the United States . 
 The genus Iridomyrmex inhabits rural , arid , and semi @-@ arid areas . Nests are found in Acacia , Agathis , Banksia , Casuarina and Eucalyptus woodland , in pastures , Callitris forests , city parks , farmlands , grasslands , heath , sand dunes , savanna woodland , swamps , urban gardens , wet rain @-@ forests , wet and dry sclerophyll woodland , and even in buildings such as hotels and houses . 
 Most of these ants nest in soil , but some prefer to live under rocks , rotten wood , and in some cases in sandy beaches and footpaths . Certain species will avoid nesting in sandy soil . Nests will vary in appearance ; most species live in small mounds with a single entrance , while other species create large mounds covered in pebbles with multiple entrances . Some colonies are known to create " super @-@ nests " : workers construct many nests connected through established paths , extending up to 650 metres ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) in length . In one extreme case , a single colony was found to occupy over 10 hectares of land with 85 individual nests and 1 @,@ 500 entrance holes . While meat ants are never aggressive to their nest mates , they will be aggressive to those who live in different nests within the same colony . Nests may be above or below ground , with some species such as I. conifer alternating between the two ; during winter , nests will be constructed above in twigs , with the ants moving back underground during the warmer months . Underground nests are located near areas where food sources are present . Colonies will relocate their nests to areas where there are reasonable levels of sunlight during winter . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 Most Iridomyrmex species are aggressive ants that will attack anything which attacks or disturbs their nests or trails they forage on . This is noticeable with particular member species of the I. purpureus species group , where they will pour out of their nest and attack and kill all intruders . Even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm out of their nests to bite and spray iridomyrmecin , a defensive chemical found in the genus . Because of their large numbers , aggression , and <unk> , Iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in Australia , and several species are known to obtain exclusive possession to food sources and prevent other insects from using them . These ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers . 
 While Iridomyrmex ants are known for their aggression , some are more timid and shy ; workers will run and hide if they are disturbed and avoid contact with other ant species . When nests are disturbed , workers will not attack ; instead , they will relocate their brood and disregard other disturbances should they occur . Workers will hide in leaves and other vegetation , and in some cases , I. <unk> workers may remain still until any threat or danger subsides . 
 Meat ants engage in ritualised fights to maintain and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies . When individuals from separate colonies meet , they will engage each other until appeasement occurs . A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles , and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger , suggesting that meat ants do this in a display of size matching . Once the ants have finished fighting , they will groom themselves and search for another ant . Such disputes between colonies may continue for months or even years in the same area , and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare . 
 = = = Foraging = = = 
 All species are predators and scavengers . Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and butterfly larvae to receive honeydew . Workers forage and scavenge for small insects , and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey . Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground , but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation to look for food . Most ants are diurnal foragers , but some are nocturnal . These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day , but this depends on the suitability of the weather . They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime ; however , I. <unk> is nocturnal and never comes out during the day . In a few species , a nest will not be placed in a shaded area ; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Iridomyrmex primarily feeds on sweet foods such as nectar and honeydew . They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young , and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes . They collect these seeds , remove the elaiosomes , and then discard the seeds . The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants , giving them a better chance of survival . Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds , and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex ; no evidence for any kind of relationship ( other than a predatory one ) is known . Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on , as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. <unk> are immune to the toxins released by the cane toads . As a result , placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population . The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 Some invertebrate species specialise in predation of Iridomyrmex ants . One spider in particular , the cursorial spider <unk> bradleyi , is a specialist predator against these ants and will use the alarm pheromones that are released by the ants during territorial disputes to locate them . The Australian thorny devil lizard ( Moloch horridus ) is a sit and wait predator that primarily preys on Iridomyrmex ants , and one lizard will reject specific species in this genus while eating others . The blind snake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens follows trails laid by these ants to locate them as a potential prey species and will eat the broods of some species , while ground beetles dig burrows near ant nests to prey on workers passing by . 
 A prominent predator is the short @-@ beaked echidna ( Tachyglossus aculeatus ) that eats the virgin queens during nuptial flight due to their high percentage of fat . Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year ; instead , they usually attack nests during August to October , which is when the winged females and males , known as alates emerge from their nest . Queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after ; birds such as currawongs , magpies and ravens , attracted by recently excavated soil , will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies . Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex . 
 = = = Life cycle and reproduction = = = 
 Nuptial flight occurs throughout the year in humid and warm climates . The alates begin to emerge from their nest and immediately climb onto tall structures ( such as tree trunks of fence @-@ posts ) where they begin to fly and copulate . Depending on the species , a queen either mates with a single male or with multiple males . Observations show that meat ant males begin to fly first , followed by the queens . Groups of 20 to 40 queens will approach the top of the nest and fly once they are warm enough , and this would proceed multiple times for many days until the climate changes or all of the queens have withdrawn from the nest . After mating , the males soon die and the queens proceed to search for a suitable nest to establish her colony . Finding a location to nest is dangerous , as birds and other ants prey on them ; disease and starvation are other causes of death in queens . While most queens will establish a nest by herself , nests can be established when queens cooperate with each other , are adopted into an existing colony , or by " budding " ( also called " satelliting " or " fractionating " ) , where a subset of the colony including queens , workers and brood ( eggs , larvae and pupae ) leave the main colony for an alternative nest site . 10 % of queens will cooperate with another queen during colony foundation . 
 Once a queen has excavated a chamber , she will lay around 20 eggs that develop into larvae in less than a month . These eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults . Mature nests range in size , from a few hundred to over 300 @,@ 000 workers . Most colonies are monogyne , meaning it only has a single queen , but some colonies can have as many as four . <unk> colonies also exist , in which multiple queens are present , but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers and antagonism exists among queens . Brood discrimination is known based on recognition of kin , and queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens . Queens display intolerance to each other when the first generation of workers is present , and the queens will separate from each other once the colony grows to a certain size . 
 = = Symbiosis = = 
 Iridomyrmex ants share symbiotic relationships with many caterpillars , aphids and <unk> . Workers protect these caterpillars and will sometimes take them to their feeding chambers inside the nest . In the genus Jalmenus , workers attend to the butterflies Jalmenus <unk> ( turquoise hairstreak ) , Jalmenus <unk> ( emerald hairstreak ) , Jalmenus <unk> ( northern hairstreak ) , Jalmenus <unk> ( amethyst hairstreak ) , Jalmenus <unk> ( varied hairstreak ) and Jalmenus <unk> ( Waterhouse 's hairstreak ) . In the genus Ogyris , attendants include Ogyris amaryllis ( satin azure ) , Ogyris olane ( olane azure ) and Ogyris <unk> ( silky azure ) . Additional species workers attend include <unk> <unk> ( pale ciliate blue ) , Candalides <unk> ( rayed blue ) , Candalides margarita ( trident pencil @-@ blue ) , <unk> <unk> ( bright <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> ( gram blue ) , <unk> <unk> ( pea blue ) , <unk> <unk> ( plumbago blue ) , Lucia <unk> ( chequered copper ) , <unk> caesia ( Kimberly spotted opal ) , <unk> <unk> ( fringed heath @-@ blue ) and <unk> <unk> ( saltbush blue ) . I. bicknelli is an effective pollinator of <unk> parviflora , and one study suggests the pollen is not harmed by contact of these ants . 
 Meat ants have been observed blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil to prevent them from leaving their nest during the early hours of the day . The ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris , a behaviour known as nest @-@ plugging . If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade , banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest , since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing . Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area , while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material . 
 = = Interaction with humans = = 
 In rural Australia , meat ants are important to farmers as they place animal carcasses on their nests . In a matter of weeks , the entire carcass will be consumed and reduced to bones . However , Iridomyrmex ants are sometimes considered pests , due to these ants entering human houses to feed on food and soil disturbance . Eradication of nests can be difficult , as nests can be repopulated from a rival colony or adjoining nests which were not affected . Particular species have adapted rather well to urbanisation ; during the early days in Canberra , newly constructed suburbs provided new nest sites for meat ants , and populations flourished . Other factors include plantations enriched with valuable food sources and home gardens . Workers also cause problems for those who are Citrus producers ; they will affect the biological control of Hemiptera insects , specifically those who produce honeydew .

 Ira Roe Foster ( January 9 , 1811 – November 19 , 1885 ) was born along the Tyger River , in Spartanburg County , South Carolina . He was a teacher , medical doctor , attorney , soldier , businessman , and politician . During the 1840s , Foster served as brigadier general in the Georgia Militia . With the outbreak of the American Civil War , he was appointed Quartermaster General of the state of Georgia , a position he continued to hold after the war 's end . He remained active in Georgia state politics into the Reconstruction period . Foster was also elected first mayor of Eastman , Georgia . He served in the Georgia House of Representatives , and was elected to the state <unk> of both Georgia and Alabama .

 Ira Roe Foster was born on January 9 , 1811 , on the Tyger River , Spartanburg County , South Carolina , to Ransom and Nancy Foster . He became a school teacher at an early age , then studied medicine and practiced in South Carolina . He then moved to Georgia where he was elected , as a Democrat to the state senate , representing Forsyth County from 1838 to 1839 . In 1841 , Foster became a licensed lawyer in Cherokee County , Georgia , serving as that county 's State Representative in the legislature . On September 2 , 1845 , U.S. Representative John H. Lumpkin wrote to President James K. Polk , urging President Polk to appoint Foster to a consular position in the West Indies . Lumpkin reminded the President that the whole of the Georgia delegation supported Foster 's application . Foster did not receive the appointment . In addition to being a merchant , Foster maintained extensive business interests in land and flour and saw mills in north @-@ central Georgia and Alabama . In early 1850 , he also invested in the Dahlonega and Marietta Turnpike and Plank Road Company .

 During the Seminole Indian War in 1836 , Foster served as a colonel of a mounted infantry , but was seriously wounded and carried on a litter for 50 miles .

Foster was subsequently commissioned brigadier general of the 2nd Brigade of the 7th Division in 1845 . 
 = = Quartermaster General of Georgia = = 
 On May 18 , 1861 , during the early months of the American Civil War , Georgia Governor Joseph E. Brown , to whom Foster had been both friend and political confidant , appointed Foster Quartermaster General for the state of Georgia . His assistant was Edward M.B. Galt , whose actual title was Chief of Ordnance , charged with supervising the forging and turning of gun barrels . On May 21 , 1861 , within days of his appointment , Foster appealed to the women of Atlanta to meet at City Hall and prepare one hundred uniforms for soldiers preparing to leave for Virginia . In the fall of 1861 , the need to obtain clothing for the Confederate Army was ( temporarily ) satisfied with the establishment of Quartermaster 's depots . Garment shops were established and shoe shops built . Georgia companies fighting in Virginia sent men back home to Georgia to collect clothing and blankets for the troops . Adjutant @-@ General Henry C. Wayne instructed Foster to " proceed personally , or by duly accredited agents , into all parts of the state , and buy 25 @,@ 000 suits of clothes and 25 @,@ 000 pairs of shoes for the destitute <unk> troops in the Confederate service . " 
 Apart from that brief period in 1861 when supplies were adequate , Georgia soldiers were chronically in need of basic essentials . In December 1862 , the Georgia Legislature appropriated $ 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 for the purchase of military clothing and blankets . Anticipating the inadequacy of that measure , it also authorized Governor Brown to seize factories and supplies , as needed . The Governor executed the order , but authorized Foster to pay sellers 10 % and manufacturers 25 % of the value of their seized goods . Foster , in the course of his duty , appealed to the people 's love of liberty in meeting the demands placed upon them . While Foster 's actions benefited the troops , the effect on civilians was harsh . According to the New Georgia Encyclopedia , The Quartermaster Department 's persistent purchases ( or impressments ) of the bulk of the state 's textile and shoe manufactures left civilians facing intense scarcity and exorbitant prices . These conditions often led to accusations of profiteering . While civilians may have faced scarcities and high prices , conditions for many Georgia soldiers were far worse . In late August 1863 , following the Battle of Gettysburg , one Georgia Colonel forwarded a requisition to Foster " in which he reported his command as destitute of everything " . Men in his unit had worn out two pairs of shoes on the Northern march , and " all faced the prospect of frostbite , pleurisy , or pneumonia in the coming winter . " By this period of the war , Gettysburg historian John Heiser observes : Georgia ... had clothing depots in Atlanta , Columbus and Athens where uniforms based on a state @-@ adopted pattern were manufactured , gathered for inspection and shipment to Richmond where these items were then distributed to Georgia units serving in Lee ’ s army . Foster 's level of organization in Georgia did not , however , result in the smooth flow of supplies , once they left the state . Heiser notes that the logistical nightmare of getting clothing to Richmond warehouses followed by transport to the army caused countless shortages and more often than not , soldiers were forced to improvise by acquiring clothing through other means . By 1864 , the situation had become even more desperate . Writing to Foster on January 24 , 1864 General James Longstreet noted : " There are five Georgia Brigades in this Army – Wofford 's , G.T. Anderson 's , Bryan 's , Benning 's , and Crews ' cavalry brigade . They are all alike in excessive need of shoes , clothing of all kinds , and blankets . All that you can send will be thankfully received . " 
 The duties of the Quartermaster General required , on occasion , a degree of clandestine activity , both to ensure the security of textile mills , and to prevent mill owners from shipping their goods to out @-@ of @-@ state buyers . According to Dr. Harold S. Wilson : 
 The sources of dangers to the mills was not always clear . In June 1864 , Enoch Steadman 's Lawrenceville factory in Georgia inexplicably burned . This company worked exclusively [ supplying finished goods for Georgia soldiers ] for Governor Joseph E. Brown , but Georgia quartermaster Ira Foster was forced to keep it under surveillance to ensure that the state received its goods . One of Steadman 's employees [ warned him ] that Quartermaster Foster had ' parties watching your concern and he has expressed the belief that you are sneaking and that he says he will have goods or <unk> 
 The Quartermaster General did not limit his efforts to supplying material to Georgia troops . On July 31 , 1863 , in an effort to thwart Union recruitment of foreigners , Foster wrote to President Jefferson Davis , proposing that the Confederacy send foreign @-@ born men of talent to their native lands , especially to Ireland to write , speak , and in every way labor to disabuse the minds of these deluded Europeans about inducements made by Union recruiting agents . 
 Foster worked to maintain supplies and clothes for Georgia soldiers throughout the war , and continuing in his office even after the collapse of the Confederacy . 
 = = = Appealing for socks = = = 
 As Quartermaster , Foster attempted to secure supplies from every source . In December 1862 , according to University of Georgia professor and historian Kenneth Coleman , Foster appealed to every woman in the state of Georgia to send him a pair of socks for the army . Another notable effort was the campaign to secure 50 @,@ 000 socks from organizations such as the " Young Ladies ' Patriotic Society " ( pledging one garment a week from each member ) as well as from individual girls and women of Georgia . In October 1863 , Foster placed announcements in newspapers throughout the state , asking for contributions . He pledged to make available an ample supply of yarn , for those <unk> willing to undertake the task , but lacking in material . Foster also asked them to attach their names to their work , so that a complete and detailed record could be maintained of each contribution and contributor . In his request , he expressed hope that the socks would : " Cheer our soldiers , discourage desertions , hurry off able bodied furloughed men to the front and stimulate them to prefer honorable deaths in the face of the enemy , to dishonest lives prolonged by shrinking from duty . " On December 24 , 1863 , a notice was placed in the Savannah Republican by one Carrie Bell Sinclair , president of the local Ladies ' Knitting Society , stating : 
 Having received from the Quartermaster General a large supply of knitting thread , members of the Society , or any one interested in the soldiers , can be supplied by calling on me any time during the week . We have been unable to supply all who have come forward and entered their names as members of the Society , having been entirely out of thread for the last two or three weeks . But we have now on hand enough for eighty or ninety pair of socks , and we hope those interested in the matter will come forward now and assist us in getting them done as early as possible . With the beginning of the New Year , let us renew our efforts in behalf of the suffering soldiers , and do all that we can for their comfort . 
 Foster 's sock campaign stimulated the supply of the much needed item , but may have also met with a certain amount of suspicion and backlash . Rumors of profiteering by the Quartermaster 's office had circulated earlier , when Foster 's purchases and impressments of textiles and shoes had driven up the price of goods . Foster claimed that new rumors , which he denied as a " malicious falsehood ! " , had spread that he and his department were profiteering from the socks . It was alleged that contributed socks were being sold , rather than given freely to the troops . The charge would not have been without precedent . The historian Jeanie Attie notes that in 1861 , an " especially damaging rumor " ( later found to be true ) had circulated in the North , alleging that the Union Army had purchased 5000 pairs of socks which had been donated , and intended for the troops , from a private relief agency , the United States Sanitary Commission . As the Sanitary Commission had done in the North , Foster undertook a propaganda campaign in Georgia newspapers to combat the alleged rumors and to encourage the continued contribution of socks . He offered $ 1 @,@ 000 @.@ 00 to any " citizen or soldier who will come forward and prove that he ever bought a sock from this Department that was either knit by the ladies or purchased for issue to said troops . "

 Leading up to the Battle of Peachtree Creek during the Atlanta campaign , Foster 's home was occupied by General A.P. Stewart ( CSA ) who made it his headquarters .

 After Atlanta 's capture by Union forces , a refugee settlement was established in Terrell County for civilians forced to flee the city . The <unk> settlement , named after the Quartermaster General , was according to author Mary Elizabeth Massey , the most ambitious refugee project approved by the Georgia General Assembly [ during that period ] . On March 11 , 1865 , the Georgia General Assembly authorized General Foster to continue to provide for maintenance of said exiles , or such of them as are unable by their labor to support themselves , or their families for the balance of the present year .

 After the fall of Atlanta , General William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea .

With the fall of Milledgeville imminent , Governor Brown ordered Foster to remove state records from the city . The task proved to be difficult , undertaken in the midst of chaos as Federal troops closed in on the city . The records were stored at a " lunatic asylum " three miles outside of town . A train was held at the depot to facilitate their removal . But in the bedlam of panicked citizens fleeing the city , labor was difficult to find .

 In 1865 , Foster traveled to Virginia , where he was imprisoned by the Union Army for his service to the Confederacy . However , in recognition of his abilities , he was subsequently released and commissioned by the Union army to distribute livestock and supplies throughout Georgia . In his History of the State of Georgia from 1850 to 1881 , the historian <unk> Avery remarks : 
 In many particulars the Federal soldiers acted very cleverly . Gen. [ James H. ] Wilson turned over to Gen. Ira Foster the Confederate mules , horses , wagons , and harness , for distribution to the poor , and Col. <unk> Washington of Macon , was associated with Gen. Foster to aid in the distribution . 
 On June 24 , 1865 , in General Order # 31 , General Wilson expressed appreciation to Foster and Washington , and relieved them of their authority , placing the task with Capt. R. Carter , <unk> , Cavalry Corps Military Division of the Mississippi .

 Foster married Mildred Arthur Creighton Crooks ( March 28 , 1810 - June 15 , 1883 ) in 1842 . They had four children : Amalthea Camilla , <unk> <unk> , Nancy Lucinda Creighton , and Marcus <unk> . In 1867 , Foster moved his family to Georgia Mountain , Alabama , where he owned six miles of Tennessee River front farming land , a large portion of the mountain and a saw mill , purchased before the war . Simultaneously , Foster operated a saw mill in Dodge County , Georgia , building a residence there in 1869 . Foster participated in the area 's saw mill boom , which was said to average one mill every two miles , along the industrial corridor created by the Macon and Brunswick Railroad . In his book The New South Comes to <unk> Georgia 1860 – 1910 author Mark V. Wetherington states : " Ira R. Foster shipped lumber to Brunswick , where it was loaded onto timber schooners and transported to international markets like Liverpool , Rio de Janeiro , and Havana . " When the city of Eastman was incorporated in 1872 , Foster served as its first mayor . Foster was also elected to the position of state senator in Alabama . He moved to Gadsden in 1883 when his wife died . There he built a two @-@ story colonial home on the stage coach route , in an area which became known as Foster 's Cross Roads . In the Alabama Senate , Foster was regarded as a reformer , supporting efficiency in state operations such as the consolidation of county poor farms into regional centers . His efforts , however , were largely thwarted by " localist sentiment " and the indifference of his fellow legislators . Foster continued to serve in the Alabama Senate until his death on November 19 , 1885 .

 = Landing at Lae = 
 The Landing at Lae was an amphibious landing to the east of Lae and then the subsequent advance on the town during the Salamaua – Lae campaign of World War II . Part of Operation Postern , which was undertaken to capture the Japanese base at Lae , the landing was undertaken between 4 and 6 September 1943 by Australian troops from the 9th Division , supported by US naval forces from the VII Amphibious Force . The first major amphibious operation undertaken by the Australian Army since the failed Gallipoli Campaign , the Australians invested a significant amount of effort into planning the operation . 
 The initial landing saw one brigade and supporting elements being landed at two beaches about 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) east of Lae . Once this brigade had secured the beachhead , a second brigade was landed to follow them up and help expand the beachhead . In the days following the landing the division 's third and final brigade was brought ashore . The landing was carried out in conjunction with the airborne landing at Nadzab , and was followed by a drive on Lae by the 7th Division from Nadzab and the 9th from the landing beaches , which advanced with two brigades while one held the landing beach . Hampered by bad weather , logistical difficulties , and stiff resistance by the Japanese defenders , the 9th Division 's advance stalled and ultimately troops from the 7th Division entered Lae first , entering the town on 16 September , the day before the 9th .

 In July 1942 , the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a series of operations by General Douglas MacArthur , the Supreme Commander , South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul , which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines or north toward the main Japanese naval base at Truk . In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of defeating Nazi Germany first , the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely the reduction of the threat posed by Japanese base at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia . 
 In 1942 and early 1943 , MacArthur 's forces fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track campaign , Battle of Milne Bay , Battle of Buna – Gona , the Battle of Wau and the Battle of the Bismarck Sea . Following these victories , the initiative passed to the Allies . At the Pacific Military Conference in Washington , D.C. , in March 1943 , MacArthur 's plans were reviewed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The chiefs were unable to supply all the requested resources , so the plans had to be scaled back , with the capture of Rabaul postponed to 1944 . On 6 May 1943 , MacArthur 's General Headquarters ( GHQ ) in Brisbane officially informed subordinate commands of the next phase of operations , which were to : 
 Occupy Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands and establish air forces thereon . 
 Seize the Lae – Salamaua – Finschhafen – Madang area and establish air forces therein . 
 Occupy western New Britain , establishing air forces at Cape Gloucester , Arawe and Gasmata . 
 The second part was assigned to General Sir Thomas Blamey 's New Guinea Force , which was a mainly Australian formation . As a result , " it became obvious that any military offensive in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army , just as during the bitter campaigns of 1942 . " 
 = = = Japanese = = = 
 In early 1942 , the Japanese began making plans for the capture of the Salamaua – Lae area , which according to <unk> Tanaka they desired as part of plans " to control the sea area to the east and north of Australia " due to the airfields located in the region . Lae was subsequently secured by a battalion of naval troops in February – March 1942 . Lae was then developed into a significant forward base for Japanese aircraft , while Salamaua was invested with a naval garrison . In December that year , the Japanese began reinforcing Lae as they sought to shore up their southern flanks after the failure of operations to capture Port Moresby . By January 1943 , the total strength of Japanese forces around Salamaua – Lae was around 6 @,@ 500 . Its strategic position , adjacent to the Solomon Sea , meant that it was the main Japanese base in the region , and throughout 1943 plans were made to hold both Lae and Salamaua . 
 By 1943 , the Japanese maintained separate army and navy headquarters at Rabaul which cooperated with each other but were responsible to different higher authorities . Naval forces came under the Southeast Area Fleet , commanded by Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka . Army forces came under General Hitoshi Imamura 's Eighth Area Army , consisting of the XVII Army in the Solomon Islands , Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi 's XVIII Army in New Guinea , and the 6th Air Division , based at Rabaul . As a result of the destruction of a convoy carrying reinforcements in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , the Japanese decided not send any more convoys to Lae , but instead to land troops at Hansa Bay and Wewak and move them forward to Lae by barge or submarine . In the long run they hoped to complete a road over the Finisterre Range and thence to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys . 
 Imamura ordered Adachi to capture the Allied bases at Wau , Bena Bena and Mount Hagen . To support these operations , Imperial General Headquarters transferred the 7th Air Division to New Guinea . On 27 July 1943 , Lieutenant General <unk> <unk> 's Fourth Air Army was assigned to Imamura 's command to control the 6th and 7th Air Divisions , the 14th Air Brigade and some miscellaneous squadrons . By June , Adachi had three divisions in New Guinea : the 41st Division at Wewak and the 20th Division around Madang , both recently arrived from Palau , and the 51st Division in the Salamaua area , a total of about 80 @,@ 000 men . Of these only the 51st Division was in contact with the enemy . Like Blamey , Adachi faced formidable difficulties of transportation and supply just to bring his troops into battle . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Lae lies on the western base of the Huon Peninsula , on the southern side of the Huon Gulf . The area was flat , and generally well @-@ drained . It had been developed as a port to meet the needs of the gold fields to the south , but there was no harbour , and deep water offshore meant that the anchorages were limited . The tidal range was small , with 3 @-@ foot @-@ 3 @-@ inch ( 0 @.@ 99 m ) spring tides and 2 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) <unk> , and there were no coral reefs . The beaches to the east of Lae were suitable for landing craft . They were composed of firm black sand or shingle , and were about 20 yards ( 18 m ) wide . But they had few exits , and for the most part were backed by dense jungle and mangrove swamps . There were no roads . The area was intercut by streams and rivers , the most important of which were the Burep and Busu Rivers . While neither wide nor deep , with firm , <unk> bottoms , they were swift @-@ flowing , with no fords , and so presented an obstacle to troops crossing . 
 = = Planning = = 
 The landing would be made by Major General George Wootten 's 9th Division , veterans of the Siege of Tobruk and the First and Second Battles of El Alamein . It had returned to Australia from the Middle East after El Alamein , and been re @-@ equipped , re @-@ organised and re @-@ trained for jungle operations around Kairi on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland . Training in amphibious warfare was conducted nearby at Trinity Beach in Cairns with the American 2nd Engineer Special Brigade . This brigade was a large formation , with an establishment strength of 354 officers , 16 warrant officers and 6 @,@ 806 enlisted men . Each of its three boat battalions had 120 small LCVPs and 12 larger LCMs , which they assembled themselves at a facility near Cairns . The 2nd Engineer Special Brigade was trained and equipped for " shore @-@ to @-@ shore " operations , over a maximum distance of 60 miles ( 100 km ) . 
 The original concept was for a brigade of the 9th Division to be ferried along the coastline of New Guinea from a forward base at Morobe . The more Blamey thought about the prospect of doing this under the noses of the Japanese air base at Lae , the more hazardous it seemed . In May he went back to MacArthur and obtained approval for the operation to be modified to employ the entire 9th Division , and that they be carried in additional large landing craft operated by the VII Amphibious Force . Also known as Task Force 76 , this was part of the US Navy 's Seventh Fleet . It was commanded by Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey , and operated large ocean @-@ going landing ships such as the LST , LCI and LCT . The ships ' greater range meant that the entire force could stage at Milne Bay and travel directly to Lae from there . In July and August 1943 , the 9th Division moved up to Milne Bay , where Barbey had already established his headquarters on board the USS Rigel . 
 As it was the first significant amphibious operation mounted by Australian forces since Gallipoli , extensive planning was put into the capture of Lae . Indeed , it was the first major operation for which the Australian Army was able to conduct long term forward planning , with deliberate planning beginning six months prior . Wooten deliberately chose landing sites beyond the range of Japanese artillery in Lae . " Red Beach " was to the east of the mouth of the Busu River , 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) east of Lae , and " Yellow Beach " near Malahang . This was the first time in SWPA that beaches were designated with colours . The left end of the beach was marked with a solid red panel mounted on tent poles , the right with one alternating red and white . At night , the left would have a red light , and the right one alternating red and white . Yellow beach was marked the same way , with yellow instead of red . Maps and models of the landing sites were made , and kept closely guarded . Soldiers were made familiar with models of the beaches where they would be landing , but the names were kept secret . Rehearsals were conducted on Normanby Island . 
 A series of meetings involving Wooten , Barbey , Edmund Herring ( Wooten 's superior as commander of I Corps ) , Colonel Merian C. Cooper from the Fifth Air Force , and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt from the RAAF , reached agreement , or at least compromise , on many points . Wooten wanted at least 10 days ' reserve rations . This meant that some stores would have to be transported in bulk , and not pre @-@ loaded on trucks as Barbey initially wanted . Loading the stores onto trucks was an inefficient use of shipping space , but permitted quick unloading of the LSTs , as the trucks could simply be driven off . The 9th Division did not have sufficient trucks for this , but 200 trucks earmarked for the US Advanced Base at Lae were borrowed from USASOS . Barbey would not allow loaded vehicles on the tank decks of the LSTs , as this was a fire hazard , so bulk stores were carried there instead . 
 Ammunition requirements were based on experience in the desert , there being no reliable data on usage in SWPA due to acute supply difficulties . Some 1 @,@ 200 long tons ( 1 @,@ 200 t ) of ammunition was drawn from the 10th Advanced Ammunition Depot at Milne Bay for the 25 @-@ pounders of the 2 / 12th Field Regiment and the Bofors 40 mm guns of the 2 / 4th Light Antiaircraft Regiment . The 9th Division also had two shore fire control parties from the 1st Australian Naval Bombardment Group to coordinate naval gunfire support , who had been specially trained at the Flinders Naval Depot in Victoria . 
 Wooten initially wanted a night landing , which would give tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft put in an appearance ; but there would be no moon on 4 September , so Barbey was uncertain that he would be able to correctly locate the beaches . H @-@ Hour was therefore set at 06 : 30 , which was twenty minutes after sunrise . Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division 's landing at Nadzab the following day , air cover would not be available in the afternoon . Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11 : 00 . This raised the question of whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4 ½ hours . Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack . For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service , where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port 's garrison supplied , the US Navy 's attitude was not good enough . 
 A key part of Blamey 's plan was for Australian and US forces to maintain pressure on the Japanese garrison around Salamaua to the south @-@ west in the lead up to the landing in an effort to draw Japanese reinforcements away from Lae . In this they were completely successful ; the Japanese 51st Division continued to reinforce the position around Salamaua , with thousands of Japanese troops , including elements of several infantry regiments and an artillery regiment , being moved to the area throughout the campaign . Allied intelligence estimated that there were 7 @,@ 250 Japanese soldiers in Lae , of whom 5 @,@ 100 were in combat units .

 Brigadier Victor Windeyer 's 20th Infantry Brigade departed Milne Bay on 2 September . The first waves were carried in destroyer transports ( APDs ) , old destroyers that had been converted to use as high @-@ speed amphibious ships ; the USS Brooks , Gilmer , Humphreys and Sands . Amphibian engineer scouts from the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade 's 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment ( EBSR ) accompanied them . The rest of the 20th Infantry Brigade travelled less comfortably in the VII Amphibious Force 's LCIs and LSTs . The Fifth Air Force carried out raids on the Japanese bases at Madan on 1 September and Wewak on 2 September in support of the operation , sinking a couple of merchant ships totalling 10 @,@ 000 tons in Wewak harbour . 
 The convoy stopped for a few hours at Buna on 3 September , where men on the LCIs were allowed to disembark . At around 12 : 15 , nine Japanese Betty bombers attacked the landing craft at Morobe , but inflicted no damage or casualties . On the night of 3 / 4 September , the final voyage to the landing beaches began . The landing was preceded by a short naval bombardment from five US destroyers . It was unopposed by Japanese land forces , with the small number of Japanese that were guarding the shore choosing to abandon their posts rather than fight . 
 There was resistance from the air , though . As the fifth wave of seven LCIs was coming in to Red Beach , they were attacked by six Zeke fighters and three Betty bombers that dropped twelve bombs . One hit the deck of USS LCI @-@ 339 forward of the conning tower ; another two were near misses . Badly damaged and riddled by bullets and fragments , the ship caught fire . LCI @-@ 339 remained on the beach , where she served as a landmark for Japanese aircraft . She was eventually towed off the beach , but then drifted onto a reef and became a total loss . USS LCI @-@ 341 suffered a near miss that tore a huge hole in its side . Eight Australians were killed , including Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Wall , the commanding officer of the 2 / 23rd Infantry Battalion , and 45 were wounded . 
 The landing operation continued despite the air attacks and within four hours of the first landing craft being lowered into the water , around 8 @,@ 000 men had been put ashore . During the initial phase of the landing the 2 / 13th Infantry Battalion landed at Yellow Beach securing the beachhead , after which it pushed patrols to the west , to link up with the 2 / 15th Infantry Battalion – which had landed at Red Beach – before advancing east towards the Hopoi Mission Station to secure the right flank of the Allied lodgement . The 2 / 17th Infantry Battalion came ashore on Red Beach behind the 2 / 15th , and pushed itself towards the west to force its way across the Buso River , and establish a beachhead on its opposite bank . The 26th Infantry Brigade then followed the 20th Brigade ashore , conducting a passage of lines with the 20th Brigade , moving through their position and then pushing west , temporarily assuming control of the 2 / 17th Infantry Battalion . 
 Engineers laid wire mesh on the beaches , felled trees , built roads and established supply dumps . While the LSTs were unloaded quickly enough , the seven bulk loaded LCTs were not , due to insufficient troops being designated to help unloading . The last was not unloaded until 14 : 30 . At 13 : 00 , six LSTs heading for Red Beach were attacked by a force of about 70 Japanese aircraft . Some 48 Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightnings were vectored to assist . USS LST @-@ 473 was rocked by two bomb hits and two near misses from Val dive bombers . Eight Americans were killed and 37 Americans and Australians wounded . USS LST @-@ 471 was torpedoed on the port side aft by a Betty bomber ; 43 Americans and Australians were killed and 30 were wounded . Particularly hard hit were the commandos of the 2 / 4th Independent Company , which lost 34 dead and 7 wounded . 
 The remaining ships continued to Red Beach , arriving on schedule at 23 : 00 . On their way back USS LST @-@ 452 and LST @-@ 458 took the two crippled LSTs in tow , and brought them back to Morobe . They then took on their cargo , and later took it to Red Beach . The wounded were taken to Buna by Humphreys . Japanese aircraft attacked the beach at 15 : 30 . An ammunition dump exploded and a fuel dump was set on fire . The 532nd EBSR lost one man killed and 12 wounded . 
 The following day , after the 26th Brigade had advanced the beachhead about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from the initial lodgement , the divisional reserve – the 24th Infantry Brigade – was brought ashore on the evening of 5 / 6 September . In the days following the landing , the Australians advanced with two brigades forward : the 24th on the coast and the 26th about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) inland . On the right of the 26th Brigade , flank security was provided by the 2 / 4th Independent Company , while the 20th Brigade remained behind to secure the beachhead . 
 = = = Advance on Lae = = = 
 Following the landing east of Lae , the 7th Division , having concentrated in Port Moresby , was flown into Nadzab following its capture by the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment ( 503rd PIR ) on 5 September . Tasked with advancing from the north @-@ west , its main role was to act as a buffer between the 9th Division and Japanese reinforcements which might try to move down through the Markham and Ramu Valleys . The 9th Division 's initial advance along the coast met with limited resistance , with the largest Japanese elements being mainly company @-@ sized . In response to the landing at Nadzab , the Japanese command ordered Lieutenant General Hidemitsu Nakano 's 51st Division to reinforce Ryoichi <unk> 's heavily entrenched garrison at Lae , falling back from the Salamaua region . There were numerous small creeks and rivers west of the Buso , including four major rivers and on the inland route , the 2 / 23rd Infantry Battalion , having crossed the Buso on the first day , began a series of what author Joseph Morgan has described as " treacherous river crossings and hard <unk> ... through the jungle " . 
 Pushing their way across the Bunga and <unk> Rivers , the 2 / 23rd fanned out through Apo village while maintaining contact with the 2 / 17th Infantry Battalion by signal cable . Around the Burep River , the 2 / 23rd was held up by the terrain and as a result the commander decided to halt and form a battalion defensive position . A platoon under Sergeant Don Lawrie was pushed forward near the mouth of the river as a protection measure to provide early warning . On 6 September , a company of Japanese attacked the 2 / 23rd 's main defensive position south of the <unk> Plantation on the western side of the <unk> River , alongside a company from the 2 / 24th Battalion . Having been alerted by Lawrie 's platoon who had sent back two runners , the battalion was able to repel the attack , although numerous casualties were inflicted on the 2 / 23rd and the 2 / 17th by Japanese mortars . The Japanese company , numbering about 60 men , subsequently fell back towards Lawrie 's platoon near the Bunga . Positioned on the Japanese line of retreat , the Australian platoon was subjected to six attacks . These were fended off over the course of the afternoon , and by evening , as heavy rain began to fall , the Australian platoon was able to break contact and withdraw back to the 2 / 23rd 's main defensive position . 
 The Japanese assault on the 2 / 23rd subsequently delayed the 9th Division 's advance for several days , and these would eventually prove significant as in that time , the rain set in , flooding the numerous waterways that forked inland from the coast . Covered with heavy fire from the opposite bank , they would prove difficult for the Australians to cross . As the advance continued , stores were pushed forward from Red Beach , and landed by <unk> and LCMs around Apo Fishing Village on 6 / 7 September , and then again on 7 September around the <unk> Plantation , from where both the 24th and 26th Infantry Brigades undertook a resupply before the advance continued . The going was slow , with the ground saturated , and the thick jungle and kunai grass along the route of advance delayed the troops who had to cut several tracks through the foliage . On the inland route , the 2 / 24th led the way towards the Burep River , while along the coast the 2 / 28th relieved the 2 / 32nd . As they reached the Burep , the two brigades separated , with the 26th advancing alongside the Burep for several miles before crossing it further inland and then driving towards the Busu . 
 By 8 September , the commander of the Japanese 51st Division , Nakano , gave the order for his forces and those in Lae to begin their withdrawal northwards , as it became clear that the twin drives on the town threatened them with encirclement . The same day , though , the Australians came up against the most significant obstacle to their advance on Lae – the Busu River – which at its widest was 700 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) across , and 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 5 ft 11 in ) deep . Three days of heavy rain had flooded the river , making it treacherous to cross ; however , the need to maintain the initiative forced the Australians to launch a hazardous crossing without bridging equipment or boats . On the coast , the 2 / 28th Infantry Battalion , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Colin Norman , attempted to run a cable across the river . This failed after the soldier who made the crossing was killed on the opposite bank by a squad of Japanese . Norman then shifted his focus to the mouth of the river , where there was a small central island that could be exploited to provide some cover for the assaulting troops . Covered by mortars and heavy machine guns , the Western Australians fixed bayonets and advanced in company lots , with the men strung out in extended line . The Japanese opened up with their own mortars and machine guns from well concealed positions on the opposite bank . Thirteen Australians drowned in the crossing , while dozens more were swept away and had to be rescued by troops from neighbouring units . Nevertheless , the 2 / 28th pushed through , subsequently securing a beachhead on the opposite bank . 
 The weather continued to hamper the 9th Division 's advance . The 26th Brigade , further inland , remained stuck on the eastern side of the Busu . On 10 September , the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the <unk> River , close to its confluence with the Busu , pushing a kunda bridge across . Shortly afterwards , they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge , and several Japanese were killed . To reinvigorate the 26th , engineer support was brought up . The 2 / 7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2 / 48th , and they subsequently arrived with boats , ropes and cables , and several attempts were made to get across , all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank . Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing . As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across , a company from the 2 / 48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade 's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade 's beachhead when it finally did get <unk> on 13 September further engineer stores arrived , including bridging equipment and folding boats , and the following day a Small Box <unk> bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank , allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September . 
 The 26th Infantry Brigade 's leading elements immediately clashed with the Japanese on the opposite bank , as they worked to push two battalions towards <unk> and the Malahang Mission , to secure the sawmill to the south @-@ west and the northern end of the Malahang airfield . Meanwhile , the 24th Infantry Brigade had pushed the 2 / 28th along the coast with a view advancing towards Malahang Anchorage , while the 2 / 32nd and 2 / 43rd invested <unk> to the south of Malahang airfield . In addition to the weather , the Allied supply situation also proved problematic , with the geography making resupply efforts difficult , while service politics led to arguments between military and naval commanders developing over misunderstandings about the capabilities of the navy and the risks involved in operating close to the shore . These factors combined to stymie the 9th Division 's progress and as a result , the 7th Division 's troops eventually beat the 9th in reaching the town , with its 25th Infantry Brigade – having fought a sharp action around Jensen 's and Heath 's Plantations – entering Lae on the morning of 16 September , just ahead of the 24th Infantry Brigade , which had taken the airfield around Malahang the day before . 
 = = Base development = = 
 Brigadier David Whitehead of the 26th Infantry Brigade assumed responsibility for Lae after its capture . Under his direction , garbage was burned , Japanese bodies were cremated , and bomb craters , shell holes and Japanese trench latrines were filled in . American and Australian malaria control units sprayed mosquito breeding grounds . He handed over responsibility for the town to US Brigadier General Carl W. Connell , the commander of US Base E. The advance party of Lieutenant Colonel O. A. <unk> ' Australian Lae Base Sub Area headquarters arrived by air on 18 September , followed by the main body by sea on 30 September . To control the Australian and American bases , Herring created the Lae Fortress under Major General Edward Milford . 
 Lae was not intended to be an air base , but the 9th Division wanted to use the Lae Drome for casualty evacuation and artillery spotting by No. 4 Squadron RAAF . By 18 September , it had been extended to 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) and widened to 200 feet ( 61 m ) , allowing four of No. 4 Squadron 's CAC Wirraways to land . The closure of the Markham Valley Road on 7 October due to heavy rainfall meant that the airbases at Nadzab and Gusap had to be maintained by air . Fuel was shipped to Lae in 44 @-@ gallon drums , and then flown to Nadzab . At one point , there was a take off or landing at Lae Drome every 26 seconds . Only after a Herculean effort by the US 842nd Engineer Aviation Battalion was the road reopened on 15 December . 
 Development of Lae as a port , on the other hand , was envisaged from the start ; but when the town was captured , the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris . The only discharge facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks . The first cargo was delivered by LST , and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs , LCMs and lighters . Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool . Initially , the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night , and they had to shove off before daybreak . Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight . Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150 @-@ ton floating crane . American engineers then installed a floating dock , which was towed to Lae in sections . It opened on 20 October , and a Type C1 ship , the Cape <unk> , discharged there that day . A new dock was completed on 23 November , although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November . A fuel jetty was built , along with a bulk petroleum storage facility , and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November . A 4 @-@ inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the capture of Lae , the Japanese high command determined that a withdrawal to a new line of defence was required . A total of about 9 @,@ 000 Japanese troops subsequently began withdrawing across the Busu River and then through the Saruwaged and Finisterre Ranges to the north @-@ east coast , while efforts were made to reinforce the Huon Peninsula , with the 20th Division being transferred from Madang to Finschhafen . The Allies , who had captured a copy of Nakano 's withdrawal order when troops from the 2 / 25th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force on 13 September , attempted to cut off the withdrawing troops and subsequently there were heavy clashes along the Markham Valley Road , with troops from the Australian 25th Infantry Brigade and 503rd PIR engaged . During the withdrawal many Japanese troops ran short of food and abandoned essential equipment , including artillery , small arms and load carriage equipment ; they subsequently reached their objective in the middle of October , having lost a further 600 to 1 @,@ 000 men on the march . Japanese strength returns indicated that the 51st Division had 6 @,@ 417 men , of whom 1 @,@ 271 were sick . The 9th Division lost 77 killed , 397 wounded and 73 missing . 
 The Allies subsequently launched a follow up campaign on the Huon Peninsula , with a landing at Scarlet Beach by the 20th Infantry Brigade . At the same time , the 22nd Infantry Battalion , an Australian Militia unit that had landed as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade on 10 / 11 September to relieve the 2 / 13th and 2 / 15th Infantry Battalions around the beachhead to free them up for the advance west on Lae , followed the Japanese that were withdrawing to the east , marching from Hopoi Mission Station to Finschhafen , with a view to placing pressure on the Japanese southern flank . This feat was described by the Kalgoorlie Miner as the " greatest march " of the New Guinea campaign and in 10 days the battalion covered 50 miles ( 80 km ) of rugged terrain . 
 The 7th Division would later advance on Dumpu through the Markham and Ramu Valleys , and over the Finisterre Range on their way towards Madang during the Finisterre Range campaign . This advance , coupled with the US seizure of New Georgia gave the Allies access to vital airfields from which they were able to project air power over Bougainville and other parts of New Guinea . Lae was also developed into an Allied logistics base , with the development of a wharf , while roads were cut through to Nadzab .

A wooden settle designed with Zodiac themes , it was made for Burges ' rooms at Buckingham Street , and later moved to the drawing room of The Tower House , the home that he designed for himself in Holland Park . Burges desired to fill his home with furniture " covered with paintings , both ornaments and subjects ; it not only did its duty as furniture , but spoke and told a story . " At one stage the poet John Betjeman gave the settle to the novelist Evelyn Waugh , and it is now in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum in Bedford .

 The settle is a wooden bench with a canopy . It is painted and stenciled , with inlaid pieces of glass crystal and vellum . In 1865 , Burges wrote , " it is almost impossible for us to conceive the effect of a first @-@ class piece of medieval sacred furniture covered with burnished gilding engraved and punched into patterns enriched with paintings by an artist like Giotto , and glittering with mosaics of gilt and coloured glass . " 
 The only settle that Burges created , its form has been likened to a day bed of the Italian Renaissance . Burges scorned his typical French Gothic influences in his design for the settle , being influenced instead by English Gothic sources as well as the Italian Renaissance . It is decorated with a central painted panel , painted by Henry Stacy Marks . The panel features an enthroned sun , with the Zodiac signs dancing around it . The signs of Leo , Virgo , Cancer , Gemini , Taurus and Aries dance on the right , and Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius , Capricorn , Aquarius and Pisces are dancing on the left . The planets of the solar system are depicted as musicians on one side of the settle , with Saint Cecilia and another female figure on the other side . It is inscribed in Latin " <unk> <unk> ME <unk> FECIT ANNO <unk> <unk> <unk> ME <unk> FECIT <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( " Burges the Architect had me made in the year of salvation 1869 however he had me painted in April of the year of salvation 1870 " ) . 
 The maker of the settle is unknown ; it is believed to be either Harland and Fisher , who had made earlier pieces of furniture for Burges , or John Walden , who made the guest bedroom furniture for the Tower House . The settle featured in photographs published in 1885 , taken in Buckingham Street by Burges 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Richard Popplewell Pullan . The settle is shown with an embroidered panel and three seat cushions .

 Designed by Burges for himself , the Zodiac settle was originally placed in his rooms at 15 Buckingham Street on the The Strand in London , and later moved to The Tower House in Holland Park around 1878 , when Burges first occupied the house . The Tower House was designed by Burges by himself . Burges continued to work on Tower House until his death in 1881 , and the Zodiac settle was placed opposite the drawing room windows in Tower House . The decoration of the drawing room remained unfinished upon Burges 's death . The Tower House was subsequently owned by Burges 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Pullan , and then by Colonel T. H. Minshall in the 1920s . Minshall offered the Zodiac settle and other items from Tower House for sale in 1933 , but the settle remained unsold . 
 The Tower House was owned by Colonel E. R. B. Graham and his wife from 1933 . The English poet John Betjeman , a champion of the architecture of the Victorian Gothic Revival , later befriended the Grahams and Betjeman was given the remaining two @-@ year lease on the Tower House and some of the furniture upon Mrs Graham 's death in 1962 . Betjeman subsequently gave the Zodiac settle as well as the " Narcissus washstand " and the " Philosophy cabinet " from Tower House to his friend , the novelist Evelyn Waugh . It is believed Betjeman gave them to Waugh to appease his wife , Penelope , who did not share his appreciation of Gothic Revival painted furniture . The " Philosophy cabinet " is now in the private collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber and the " Narcissus washstand " in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum in Bedford . Waugh mentioned the settle in a letter to his daughter <unk> FitzHerbert in July 1965 . Waugh wrote that the settle was " looking very well between the windows of the morning @-@ room " . The settle descended through the Waugh family before being acquired by The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum in 2011 .

 = Typhoon Omar = 
 Typhoon Omar of 1992 , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Lusing , was the strongest and costliest typhoon to strike Guam since Typhoon Pamela in 1976 . The cyclone formed on August 23 from the monsoon trough across the western Pacific Ocean . Moving westward , Omar slowly intensified into a tropical storm , although another tropical cyclone nearby initially impeded further strengthening . After the two storms became more distant , Omar quickly strengthened into a powerful typhoon . On August 28 , it made landfall on Guam with winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . The typhoon reached its peak intensity the next day , with estimated 1 ‑ minute winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , making it a " super typhoon " according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) . Omar weakened significantly before striking eastern Taiwan on September 4 , proceeding into eastern China the next day and dissipating on September 9 . 
 On Guam , Omar caused one death and $ 457 million ( 1992 USD ) in damage . Strong gusts up to 248 km / h ( 154 mph ) left nearly the entire island without power for several days . The outages disrupted the water system and prevented the island @-@ based JTWC from issuing advisories for 11 days . Omar damaged or destroyed 2 @,@ 158 houses , leaving 3 @,@ 000 people homeless . In response to the destruction , the island 's building codes were updated to withstand winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , and insurance companies discontinued new policies for structures not made of concrete . While passing well north of the Philippines , the typhoon killed 11 people and wrought ₱ 903 million ( $ 35 @.@ 4 million ) worth of damage to 538 houses . Omar then brushed the southern islands of Japan with strong gusts and light rainfall , causing ¥ 476 million JPY ( $ 3 @.@ 8 million USD ) in crop losses . In Taiwan , scattered flooding caused three deaths and $ 65 million in damage , mostly to agriculture . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Typhoon Omar originated from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on August 20 over the open Pacific Ocean , which exhibited persistent convection , or thunderstorms . During this early phase , two tropical cyclones dissipated and another became extratropical across the western Pacific basin ; this caused the monsoon trough , which spawned most of the storms in the basin , to realign in a more climatologically appropriate manner . According to the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) , Omar developed into a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on August 23 . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) assessed a slower pace of strengthening , issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert at 2100 UTC before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 15W on August 24 . 
 As the depression traveled generally westward , the JTWC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Omar on August 25 , and the JMA followed suit on the next day . Omar began to slow as it tracked westward . Outflow from nearby Tropical Storm Polly to the west produced a stream of strong wind shear over Omar , slowing intensification . The JTWC noted that the shear could decouple Omar 's wind circulation from its convection , possibly weakening the storm . However , as Omar and Polly moved farther apart , a high @-@ pressure ridge developed between the storms . This caused Omar to drift northward and then west @-@ northwestward into a region with decreased shear , which allowed it to resume strengthening . Early on August 27 , the JTWC upgraded the system to a typhoon , and an eye began to appear around 23 : 00 UTC that day . Omar entered a phase of rapid intensification on August 28 , at which point the JMA also classified it as a typhoon . The typhoon made landfall on Guam soon after , with 1 ‑ minute sustained winds of about 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . The eye , 37 km ( 23 mi ) in diameter , slowly crossed the northern portion of the small island over a period of 2 @.@ 5 hours . 
 At 1800 UTC on August 29 , Omar reached its peak intensity with 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 17 inHg ) as estimated by the JMA ; this intensity was maintained for 24 hours before a steady weakening trend began . The JTWC estimated higher 1 ‑ minute winds of around 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , making Omar a super typhoon . Two days later , the typhoon came close enough to the Philippines to warrant monitoring from PAGASA , who named the storm Lusing . By 1500 UTC on September 3 , the JMA downgraded Omar to a tropical storm , although the JTWC maintained its typhoon intensity through the next day . Heading generally westward , the storm made landfall on the east coast of Taiwan near Hualien City on September 4 . After traversing the island in seven hours , Omar exited the coast of Yunlin County and emerged into the Taiwan Strait . The storm crossed the body of water and moved ashore in eastern China near Xiamen , Fujian , on September 5 . Inland , Omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west @-@ southwest . It proceeded across southern China while heavily weakening , and completely dissipated over northern Vietnam on September 9 .

 Ahead of the storm on August 25 , the United States Department of Defense set the Condition of Readiness ( COR ) at stage 3 on Guam , indicating destructive winds were possible within 48 hours . A day later , the COR was raised to stage 2 ; all but two United States Navy ships were sortied from the harbor to prevent damage , and the remainder rode out the storm southwest of Guam . On August 28 , COR 1 was declared , the highest level . In response , all fixed @-@ wing aircraft and helicopters on the island were moved into hangars or transported to Japan or the Philippines . All schools were closed for the duration of Omar 's passage over Guam . Flight operations were suspended for at least two days , stranding 5 @,@ 000 passengers on the island . About 3 @,@ 100 people rode out the storm in emergency shelters . 
 Omar was the strongest and most damaging typhoon to hit Guam since Typhoon Pamela in 1976 . The typhoon was felt on all parts of Guam ; tropical @-@ storm @-@ force winds affected the island for 16 hours , and wind gusts were estimated to have reached 248 km / h ( 154 mph ) in areas beneath the western eyewall . However , the high winds caused the anemometer at Hagåtña to fail during the eye 's passage , and the radar at Andersen Air Force Base was lost , preventing accurate wind speed assessments . The lowest barometric pressure was 940 mbar ( 27 @.@ 76 inHg ) at Apra Harbor . Omar 's slow movement resulted in prolonged heavy rainfall , peaking at 519 mm ( 20 @.@ 44 in ) at the Guam National Weather Service Office in Tiyan and reaching 417 mm ( 16 @.@ 41 in ) at Andersen AFB . 
 Damage on Guam was heaviest from the central region to the northern coast , in particular to tourist areas and military bases . The Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station was shut down due to power outages and water damage to the generators . The USS Niagara Falls ( AFS @-@ 3 ) and USS White Plains ( AFS @-@ 4 ) — both naval supply ships — went aground due to rough seas and strong winds , and the dry dock at Apra Harbor was washed ashore . Omar destroyed dozens of businesses on the island . High winds knocked a crane into an apartment building and downed 400 wooden and 20 concrete power poles across Tumon , leaving 70 % of the island without power . Throughout Guam , Omar disrupted transportation and communication systems , and led to the failure of water pumping systems . Landslides covered roads , and low @-@ lying areas were flooded . About 2 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed and another 2 @,@ 200 were damaged to varying degrees , displacing nearly 3 @,@ 000 people . Destruction was heaviest to wooden structures ; buildings made of concrete fared relatively well during the storm . Island @-@ wide , damage totaled $ 457 million , split nearly evenly between the military bases and civilian damage . One person died on Guam , and more than 200 people required emergency treatment — including about 80 injured by flying debris .

 While over the open Pacific Ocean , Omar passed well northeast of the Philippines just days after Tropical Storm Polly caused flooding and deaths in the country . The nation 's chief weather specialist noted that Omar was " more powerful than Polly and [ able to ] induce monsoon rains over a wide area . " Omar ultimately affected northern Luzon , primarily the Cordillera Administrative Region , Ilocos Region , and the Cagayan Valley . Across the country , the storm killed 11 people . The typhoon destroyed 393 houses and damaged another 145 , leaving 1 @,@ 965 people homeless . Damage was estimated at ₱ 903 million ( $ 35 @.@ 4 million ) , much of it to agriculture . 
 After its destructive landfall in Guam , Omar struck <unk> District in Taiwan with maximum winds of 78 km / h ( 49 mph ) . The worst effects in the country were from widespread rain ; the strongest rainfall rates remained concentrated in southern regions , peaking at 375 @.@ 4 mm ( 14 @.@ 78 in ) in Kaohsiung . The storm flooded five counties and left 766 @,@ 000 people without power . High waves washed ashore four ships in Kaohsiung , and farmland and fisheries there , as well as in Yunlin , Chiayi City , and Pingtung County , suffered heavy damage . Throughout Taiwan , Omar resulted in three deaths ( two of which drownings ) , twelve injuries , and more than $ 65 million ( USD ) in damage . 
 The fringes of the typhoon dropped light rainfall in the outer regions of Japan , peaking at 28 mm ( 1 @.@ 1 in ) on Iriomote @-@ jima . The highest wind gust was 72 km / h ( 45 mph ) on Yonaguni . Omar damaged the sugar cane and okra in the southern Japanese islands , leading to crop losses of ¥ 476 million JPY ( $ 3 @.@ 8 million USD ) . In addition , traffic was disrupted and 38 flights were canceled . Later , Omar spread rainfall along its path through southern China , flooding parts of northwestern Hong Kong on September 7 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Immediately after Omar 's landfall in Guam , former Governor Joseph Franklin Ada declared a state of emergency , and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush declared the island a federal disaster area . In the wake of the storm , several people were arrested for looting . The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened up disaster assistance centers where residents were able to apply for federal aid ; it ultimately provided about $ 18 @.@ 4 million in assistance , including disaster housing , storm @-@ related unemployment benefits , and grant programs for families or businesses , helping over 11 @,@ 000 people . The federal government paid for 100 % of the debris removal , emergency work , and reconstruction of uninsured public buildings , although it usually only provide 75 % of the cost for typical disasters . This was due to the sequence of three significant tropical cyclones affecting the United States in three weeks ; in addition to Omar , Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in August and Hurricane Iniki hit Hawaii in September . The Department of Defense assisted the affected areas with 27 members of the Guam National Guard and 700 members of the military . The military provided temporary housing , generators , and construction supplies , at a cost of $ 5 @.@ 75 million , though most of the disaster needs were handled by the government . The local Red Cross provided $ 6 million in assistance after the storm . Due to the combined damages from Andrew , Iniki , and Omar , the United States Congress passed the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act , 1992 , which provided additional funding for the agencies responding to the disasters through the fiscal year ending on September 30 . 
 For 11 days , the JTWC on Guam was unable to continue operations , relying on a backup agency . The damage to the airport radar prompted the NEXRAD — a network of high @-@ resolution weather radars — to be installed earlier than scheduled , in February 1993 , and limited incoming and outgoing flights to the daytime . On August 30 , a naval ship docked at Apra Harbor to provide a temporary mobile radar . By September 15 , both ships that had been washed ashore were refloated . In the aftermath of the destruction , insurance companies decided to stop issuing new policies for structures not made of concrete . In January 1996 , former Governor Carl Gutierrez issued an executive order , mandating that homes or storm shutters on the island withstand winds of at least 250 m / h ( 155 mph ) . 
 The citizens left homeless by Omar resided in a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar , consisting of 200 tents holding more than 1 @,@ 000 people . Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks . Many important roads were reopened by three days after the storm . The power took four weeks to be restored island @-@ wide , disrupting schools and businesses , although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm . Schools reopened on September 14 , and most businesses resumed their work by the end of the month . The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19 , though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons . These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures . As a result , it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992 . A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7 @.@ 2 % of 320 participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction , and another 15 % developed early traumatic stress response , especially those affected by the later typhoons . About 5 @.@ 9 % of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder , similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989 . 
 Due to the destruction in Guam , the name Omar was retired and was replaced with Oscar in 1993 . 
 = Battle of Chosin Reservoir = 
 The Battle of Chosin Reservoir , also known as the Chosin Reservoir Campaign or the Changjin Lake Campaign ( Korean : <unk> 전투 ( <unk> ) ; Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , was a decisive battle in the Korean War . " Chosin " is the Japanese pronunciation of the Korean name , " Changjin " . The UN forces relied on Japanese language maps dating from their occupation of Korea which had only ended five years earlier at the conclusion of World War II . Shortly after the People 's Republic of China entered the conflict , the People 's Volunteer Army 9th Army infiltrated the northeastern part of North Korea . 
 On 27 November , the Chinese 9th Army surprised the US X Corps commanded by Major General Edward Almond at the Chosin Reservoir area . A brutal 17 day battle in freezing weather soon followed . In the period between 27 November and 13 December 1950 , 30 @,@ 000 United Nations troops ( later nicknamed " The Chosin Few " ) under the field command of Major General Oliver P. Smith were encircled and attacked by approximately 120 @,@ 000 Chinese troops under the command of Song Shi @-@ Lun , who had been ordered by Mao Zedong to destroy the UN forces . The UN forces were nonetheless able to make a fighting withdrawal and broke out of the encirclement while inflicting crippling losses on the Chinese . While the battle resulted in the Chinese pushing the UN out of North Korea , it was a Pyrrhic victory . The evacuation of the X Corps from the port of Hungnam marked the complete withdrawal of UN troops from North Korea . 
 = = Background = = 
 By mid @-@ 1950 after the successful landing at Inchon by the US X Corps and the subsequent destruction of the Korean People 's Army , the Korean War appeared to be all but over . United Nations ( UN ) forces advanced rapidly into North Korea with the intention of reuniting North and South Korea before the end of 1950 . North Korea is divided through the center by the impassable Taebaek Mountains , which separated the UN forces into two groups . The US Eighth Army advanced north through the western coast of the Korean Peninsula , while the Republic of Korea ( ROK ) I Corps and the US X Corps advanced north on the eastern coast . 
 At the same time the People 's Republic of China entered the conflict after issuing several warnings to the United Nations . On 19 October 1950 , large formations of Chinese troops , dubbed the People 's Volunteer Army ( PVA ) , secretly crossed the border and into North Korea . One of the first Chinese units to reach the Chosin Reservoir area was the PVA 42nd Corps , and it was tasked with stopping the eastern UN advances . On 25 October , the advancing ROK I Corps made contact with the Chinese and halted at Funchilin Pass , south of the Chosin Reservoir . After the landing at Wonsan , the US 1st Marine Division of the X Corps engaged the defending PVA 124th Division on 2 November , and the ensuing battle caused heavy casualties among the Chinese . On 6 November , the PVA 42nd Corps ordered a retreat to the north with the intention of luring the UN forces into the Chosin Reservoir . By 24 November , the 1st Marine Division occupied both Sinhung @-@ ni on the eastern side of the reservoir , and Yudami @-@ ni on the west side of the reservoir . 
 Faced with the sudden attacks by Chinese forces in the Eighth Army sector , General Douglas MacArthur ordered the Eighth Army to launch the Home @-@ by @-@ Christmas Offensive . To support the offensive , MacArthur ordered the X Corps to attack west from the Chosin Reservoir and to cut the vital <unk> — <unk> — <unk> supply line . As a response , Major General Edward M. Almond , commander of the US X Corps , formulated a plan on 21 November . It called for the US 1st Marine Division to advance west through Yudami @-@ ni , while the US 7th Infantry Division would provide a regimental combat team to protect the right flank at Sinhung @-@ ni . The US 3rd Infantry Division would also protect the left flank while providing security in the rear area . By then the X Corps was stretched thin along a 400 miles ( 640 km ) front . 
 Surprised by the Marine landing at Wonsan , China 's Chairman Mao Zedong called for the immediate destruction of the ROK Capital Division , ROK 3rd Infantry Division , US 1st Marine Division , and US 7th Infantry Division in a telegraph to Commander Song Shi @-@ Lun of the PVA 9th Army on 31 October . Under Mao 's urgent orders , the 9th Army was rushed into North Korea on 10 November . Undetected by UN intelligence , the 9th Army quietly entered the Chosin Reservoir area on 17 November , with the 20th Corps of the 9th Army relieving the 42nd Corps near Yudami @-@ ni . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 = = = Location , terrain and weather = = = 
 Chosin Reservoir is a man @-@ made lake located in the northeast of the Korean peninsula . The name Chosin is the Japanese pronunciation of the Korean place name Changjin , and the name stuck due to the outdated Japanese maps used by UN forces . The battle 's main focus was around the 78 miles ( 126 km ) long road that connects Hungnam and Chosin Reservoir , which served as the only retreat route for the UN forces . Through these roads , Yudami @-@ ni and Sinhung @-@ ni , located at the west and east side of the reservoir respectively , are connected at Hagaru @-@ ri . From there , the road passes through Koto @-@ ri and eventually leads to the port of Hungnam . The area around the Chosin Reservoir was sparsely populated . 
 The battle was fought over some of the roughest terrain during some of the harshest winter weather conditions of the Korean War . The road was created by cutting through the hilly terrain of Korea , with steep climbs and drops . Dominant peaks , such as the Funchilin Pass and the Toktong Pass , overlook the entire length of the road . The road 's quality was poor , and in some places it was reduced to a one lane gravel trail . On 14 November , a cold front from Siberia descended over the Chosin Reservoir , and the temperature plunged to as low as − 35 ° F ( − 37 ° C ) . The cold weather was accompanied by frozen ground , creating considerable danger of frostbite casualties , icy roads , and weapon malfunctions . Medical supplies froze ; morphine <unk> had to be defrosted in a medic 's mouth before they could be injected ; frozen blood plasma was useless on the battlefield . Even cutting off clothing to deal with a wound risked gangrene and frostbite . Batteries used for the Jeeps and radios did not function properly in the temperature and quickly ran down . The lubrication in the guns gelled and rendered them useless in battle . Likewise , the springs on the firing pins would not strike hard enough to fire the round , or would jam . 
 = = = Forces and strategies = = = 
 Although the 1st Marine Division landed at Wonsan as part of Almond 's US X Corps , Almond and Major General Oliver P. Smith of the 1st Marine Division shared a mutual loathing of each other that dated back to a meeting before the landing at Inchon , during which Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious landings are even though he had never been involved in one . Smith believed that there were large numbers of Chinese forces in North Korea despite the fact that higher headquarters in Tokyo had said otherwise , while Almond felt Smith was overly cautious . The mutual distrust between the two commanders made Smith slow the 1st Marine Division 's advance towards the Chosin Reservoir against Almond 's instructions . Along the way Smith established supply points and airfields at Hagaru @-@ ri and Koto @-@ ri . 
 While the US X Corps was pushing towards the reservoir , the Chinese formulated their strategy based on their experiences in the Chinese Civil War . Working from the assumption that only a light UN presence would be at the reservoir , the 9th Army was to first destroy the UN garrisons at Yudami @-@ ni and Sinhung @-@ ni , then push towards Hagaru @-@ ri . Believing that the bulk of the US X Corps would scramble to rescue the destroyed units , the 9th Army would then block and trap the main UN forces on the road between Hagaru @-@ ri and Hungnam . The 9th Army initially committed eight divisions for the battle , with most of the forces concentrated at Yudami @-@ ni and Sinhung @-@ ni . 
 The flaw in the Chinese plan was a lack of accurate intelligence on the UN forces . Although the US X Corps was stretched thin over northeast Korea , the slow Marine advance allowed the bulk of the US 1st Marine Division , including the 5th , 7th and 11th Marines , to be concentrated at Yudami @-@ ni . Conversely , the strategically important Hagaru @-@ ri , which contained an airfield and a supply dump , was not a priority for the Chinese despite being lightly defended by the 1st and the 7th Marines . Only the Regimental Combat Team 31 , an understrength and hastily formed regimental combat team of the US 7th Infantry Division , was thinly spread along the eastern bank of the reservoir . Those units would later take the brunt of the Chinese assaults . As for the UN strength , the 1st Marine Division had an effective strength of 25 @,@ 473 men at the start of the battle , and it was further reinforced by the British 41 Royal Marine Commando and the equivalent strength of two regiments from the 3rd and the 7th Infantry Divisions . Thus the UN forces had an approximate strength of 30 @,@ 000 during the course of the battle . The UN forces at Chosin were also supported by one of the greatest concentrations of air power during the Korean War , in which the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing stationed at Yonpo Airfield and five aircraft carriers from the US Navy Task Force 77 were able to launch 230 sorties daily to provide close air support during the battle , while the US Air Force Far East Combat Cargo Command in Japan reached the capacity of airdropping 250 tons of supplies per day to resupply the trapped UN forces . 
 Although the 9th Army was one of China 's elite formations composed of veterans and former POWs from the <unk> Campaign , several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle . Initially the 9th Army was intended to be outfitted in Manchuria during November , but Mao suddenly ordered it into Korea before that could happen . As the result , the 9th Army received almost no winter gear for the harsh Korean winter . Similarly , poor logistics forced the 9th Army to abandon heavy artillery , while working with little food and ammunition . The food shortage forced the 9th Army to initially station a third of its strength away from the Chosin Reservoir as reserve , and starvation and exposure soon broke out among the Chinese units as foraging was not an option at the sparsely populated reservoir . By the end of the battle , more Chinese troops died from the cold than from combat and air raids . 
 As for the Chinese strength , it is normally assumed that the Chinese had 120 @,@ 000 troops for the battle , due to the fact that the 9th Army were composed of 12 divisions with a strength of 10 @,@ 000 + men per division . Before arriving in Korea , the 9th Army was reinforced . Each of its three Corps now had four divisions instead of the regular three . Infantry from two formerly liberated ( surrendered ) Nationalist divisions were absorbed to bring each infantry company up to strength . Some companies had ~ 150 men , but some companies were reinforced with more than 200 men . On average , each division of the 9th Army had more infantry troops than other Chinese divisions . 
 Eventually all 12 Chinese divisions of the 9th Army were deployed . Eight divisions of the PVA 20th and 27th Corps served as the main attacking force . Four divisions of the PVA 26th Corps initially were held back in reserve , and deployed after 20th and <unk> Corps exhausted all available strength .

 On the night of 27 November , the PVA 20th and 27th Corps of the 9th Army launched multiple attacks and ambushes along the road between the Chosin Reservoir and Koto @-@ ri . At Yudam @-@ ni , the 5th , 7th and 11th Marines were surrounded and attacked by the PVA 79th and 89th Divisions , with the 59th Division attacking the road between Yudam @-@ ni and Hagaru @-@ ri to cut off communication . Similarly , RCT @-@ 31 was isolated and ambushed at Sinhung @-@ ni by the PVA 80th , 81st and 94th Divisions . At Hagaru @-@ ri , the 1st Marine Division command headquarters was attacked by the PVA 58th Division . Finally , the PVA 60th Division surrounded elements of the 1st Marines at Koto @-@ ri from the north . Caught by complete surprise , the UN forces were cut off at Yudam @-@ ni , Sinhung @-@ ni , Hagaru @-@ ri and Koto @-@ ri by 28 November .

 Acting on Almond 's instruction , Smith ordered the 5th Marines to attack west toward Mupyong @-@ ni on 27 November . The attack was soon stalled by the PVA 89th Division and forced the Marines to dig in on the ridges surrounding Yudam @-@ ni . As night came , three Chinese regiments of the 79th Division attacked the ridges on the north and northwest of Yudam @-@ ni , hoping to annihilate the garrison in one stroke . Close range fighting soon developed as the attackers infiltrated Marine positions , but the 5th and 7th Marines held the line while inflicting heavy casualties to the Chinese . As day broke on 28 November , the Chinese forces and the American defenders were locked in a stalemate around the Yudam @-@ ni perimeter . 
 While the battle was underway at Yudam @-@ ni , the PVA 59th Division blocked the road between Yudam @-@ ni and Hagaru @-@ ri by attacking the defending Charlie and Fox Companies of the 7th Marines . The successful assault forced Charlie Company to retreat into Yudam @-@ ni which left Fox Company trapped in Toktong Pass , a vital pass that controlled the road . On 29 November , several efforts by the 7th Marines failed to rescue Fox Company despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese . Aided by artillery from Hagaru @-@ ri and Marine Corsair fighters , Fox Company managed to hold out for five days while enduring constant attacks by the PVA 59th Division . 
 After the heavy losses suffered by the PVA 79th Division at Yudam @-@ ni , 9th Army headquarters realized that the bulk of the 1st Marine Division was stationed at Yudam @-@ ni , with a garrison strength that was double the initial estimate . Believing that any further assaults would be futile , Song Shi @-@ Lun ordered the 9th Army to switch their main attacks toward Sinhung @-@ ni and Hagaru @-@ ri , leaving Yudam @-@ ni alone from 28 November to 30 November . At the same time , the US Eighth Army on the Korean western front was forced into full retreat at the Battle of the Ch 'ongch 'on River , and MacArthur ordered Almond to withdraw the US X Corps to the port of Hungnam . Acting on the instruction of Almond and Smith , Lieutenant Colonel Raymond L. Murray and Colonel Homer L. <unk> , commanders of the 5th and 7th Marines , respectively , issued a joint order to break out from Yudam @-@ ni to Hagaru @-@ ri on 30 November . Faced with tough fighting between the blocking Chinese divisions and the withdrawing Marines , Smith remarked : " Retreat , hell ! We 're not retreating , we 're just advancing in a different direction . " 
 For the breakout , the Marines formed into a convoy with a single M4A3 Sherman tank as the lead . The plan was to have 3rd Battalion , 5th Marines ( 3 / 5 ) as the vanguard of the convoy , with three battalions covering the rear . At the same time , 1st Battalion , 7th Marines ( 1 / 7 ) would attack towards Fox Company in order to open the road at Toktong Pass . To start the breakout , 3rd Battalion , 7th Marines ( 3 / 7 ) had to first attack south and capture Hill 1542 and Hill 1419 in order to cover the road from Chinese attacks . The breakout was carried out under the air cover of the 1st Marine Air Wing . 
 On the morning of 1 December , 3rd Battalion , 7th Marines ( 3 / 7 ) engaged the PVA 175th Regiment of the 59th Division at Hill 1542 and Hill 1419 . The tenacious Chinese defenders soon forced the Marines to dig in on the slopes between the road and the peaks when the convoy passed 3 / 7 's position by the afternoon . With Hagaru @-@ ri still not captured , the PVA High Command scrambled the 79th Division to resume attacks on Yudam @-@ ni while the 89th Division rushed south towards Koto @-@ ri . The Chinese struck at night , and the ferocious fighting forced the rear covering forces to call in night fighters to suppress the attacks . The fighting lasted well into the morning of 2 December until all the Marines managed to withdraw from Yudam @-@ ni . 
 At the same time , 1st Battalion , 7th Marines ( 1 / 7 ) also tried to break the Chinese blockade at Hill 1419 on 1 December . Despite being badly reduced by combat , hunger and frostbite , the PVA 59th Division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield . As night approached , 1 / 7 finally captured the peak and started to march through the hills on the east side of the road . Relying on the element of surprise , they managed to destroy several Chinese positions along the road . On the morning of 2 December , a joint attack by Fox Company and 1 / 7 secured the Toktong Pass , thus opening the road between Yudam @-@ ni and Hagaru @-@ ri . 
 Although the road had been opened between Yudam @-@ ni and Hagaru @-@ ri , the convoy still had to fight through the numerous Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road . On the first night of the retreat , the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion , 5th Marines ( 3 / 5 ) . Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces for the rest of the march , the cold weather , harassing fire , raiding parties , and road blocks slowed the retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties . Despite those difficulties , the convoy reached Hagaru @-@ ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December , with the withdrawal completed on 4 December .

 Regimental Combat Team 31 ( RCT @-@ 31 ) , later known as " Task Force Faith " , was a hastily formed regimental combat team from the 7th Infantry Division that guarded the right flank of the Marine advance towards Mupyong @-@ ni . Before the battle , RCT @-@ 31 was spread thin with main elements separated on the hills north of Sinhung @-@ ni , the inlet west of Sinhung @-@ ni , and the town of Hudong @-@ ni south of Sinhung @-@ ni . Although the Chinese believed RCT @-@ 31 to be a reinforced regiment , the task force was actually under strength with one battalion missing , due to the bulk of the 7th Infantry Division being scattered over northeast Korea . 
 On the night of 27 November , three regiments from the 80th Division attacked the northern hills and the inlets , completely surprising the defenders . The ensuing battle inflicted heavy casualties on the 1st Battalion , 32nd Infantry to the north of Sinhung @-@ ni , while the 57th Field Artillery Battalion and the 3rd Battalion , 31st Infantry were almost overrun at the inlet . The Chinese also sent the 242nd Regiment of the 81st Division towards Hill 1221 , an undefended hill that controlled the road between Sinhung @-@ ni and Hudong @-@ ni . As the night 's fighting ended , RCT @-@ 31 was separated into three elements . 
 Believing that the defenders were completely destroyed at the inlet , the Chinese stopped their attacks and proceeded to loot the US positions for food and clothing . As the morning came on 28 November , the 3rd Battalion , 31st Infantry counterattacked the PVA 239th Regiment at the inlet , sending the surprised Chinese back in a complete rout . In the afternoon , Almond flew into the perimeter of RCT @-@ 31 , convinced that RCT @-@ 31 was strong enough to begin its attack north and deal with whatever " remnants " of Chinese forces that were in their way . Almond ordered Colonel Allan D. Maclean , the commander of RCT @-@ 31 , to resume the offensive north while presenting Silver Stars to three of Maclean 's officers . In disgust , Lieutenant Colonel Don C. Faith , Jr . , the commander of the 1st Battalion , 32nd Infantry , threw his medal into the snow . 
 On the night of 28 November , the PVA 80th Division attacked again with four regiments . At the inlet , the Chinese assault became a disaster as communications broke down while devastating fire from the anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns attached to the 57th Field Artillery Battalion swept the Chinese ranks . In the aftermath of the fighting , the PVA 238th and the 239th Regiment together had less than 600 soldiers . The attacks by PVA 240th Regiment , on the other hand , forced Maclean to order a retreat from the northern hills towards the inlet . On 29 November , the 1st Battalion managed to break through the Chinese blockade and reached the inlet , but Maclean disappeared as he mistook some Chinese soldiers as American . The Chinese finally stopped their attacks on the night of 29 November while waiting for fresh reinforcements . 
 While RCT @-@ 31 was under siege , Almond finally instructed the 1st Marine Division to rescue RCT @-@ 31 by breaking out of Yudam @-@ ni — an impossible order for Smith to implement . Only the 31st Tank Company tried to rescue RCT @-@ 31 by attacking Hill 1221 , but without infantry support , the two armored attacks on 28 and 29 November were stalled by slippery roads , rough terrain , and close infantry assaults . By 30 November the US forces evacuated Hudong @-@ ni in order to defend Hagaru @-@ ri , leaving the rest of RCT @-@ 31 completely stranded . 
 On 30 November , Major General David G. Barr , the commander of the 7th Infantry Division , flew into the Sinhung @-@ ni inlet and met with Faith , who by now had assumed command of RCT @-@ 31 . Faith expressed the difficulties for a breakout , particularly the 500 wounded that RCT @-@ 31 had to carry . On the same day , parts of the PVA 94th Division and the rest of 81st <unk> as reinforcements for the 80th Division . By midnight , six Chinese regiments renewed their attacks and Zhan Danan , the commander of the 80th Division , ordered the complete destruction of RCT @-@ 31 before dawn . Again , the 57th Battalion 's AA guns held the Chinese at bay , but the shell supplies were running desperately low . On the day of 1 December , Faith finally ordered RCT @-@ 31 to breakout from Sinhung @-@ ni and withdraw to Hagaru @-@ ri . 
 The breakout began as soon as the weather allowed the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing to provide air cover on 1 December . As the soldiers formed a convoy and tried to leave the perimeter , the PVA 241st Regiment immediately swarmed over the American forces , with three other regiments closing in . Left with no choice , the covering aircraft dropped napalm right in front of RCT @-@ 31 , causing casualties among both Chinese and US troops . The resulting firestorm wiped out the blocking Chinese company , allowing the convoy to advance . As the front of RCT @-@ 31 made their way forward , heavy small arms fire caused many members of the rear guard to seek shelter below the road instead of protecting the trucks . Chinese fire also killed or wounded those already in the trucks as well as the drivers , who viewed the job as a form of suicide . Slowly , the convoy approached a roadblock under Hill 1221 in the late afternoon . Several parties tried to clear Hill 1221 , but after taking part of the hill , the leaderless soldiers continued out onto the frozen reservoir instead of returning to the column . As Faith led an assault on the roadblock , he was hit by a Chinese grenade and subsequently died of his wounds . The convoy managed to fight past the first road block , but as it reached the second at Hudong @-@ ni , RCT @-@ 31 disintegrated under Chinese attacks . About 1 @,@ 050 soldiers out of the original 2 @,@ 500 managed to reach Hagaru @-@ ri , and only 385 survivors were deemed able @-@ bodied . The remnants of RCT @-@ 31 were formed into a provisional army battalion for the rest of the battle . 
 = = = Actions at Hagaru @-@ ri = = = 
 To support the Marine attack towards Mupyong @-@ ni , Hagaru @-@ ri became an important supply dump with an airfield under construction . Smith and 1st Marine Division headquarters were also located at Hagaru @-@ ri . With the bulk of the 1st Marine Division gathered at Yudam @-@ ni , Hagaru @-@ ri was lightly defended by two battalions from the 1st and 7th Marines , the rest of the garrison being composed of engineers and rear support units from both the Army and the Marine Corps . 
 The original Chinese plan called for the 58th Division to attack Hagaru @-@ ri on the night of 27 November , but the division became lost in the countryside due to the outdated Japanese maps it used . It was not until the dawn of 28 November that the 58th Division arrived at Hagaru @-@ ri . Meanwhile , from the fighting and ambushes that had occurred the previous night , the garrison at Hagaru @-@ ri noticed the Chinese forces around them . Lieutenant Colonel Thomas L. Ridge , commander of 3rd Battalion , 1st Marines ( 3 / 1 ) , predicted the Chinese attack would come on the night of 28 November . Almost everyone , including rear support units with little combat training , was pressed into the front line due to the manpower shortage , and the entire perimeter was on full alert by 21 : 30 . 
 It was not long before the PVA 173rd Regiment attacked the western and the southern perimeter , while the 172nd Regiment struck the hills on the northern perimeter . Despite the preparations , the understrength garrison was overwhelmed , with the Chinese opening several gaps in the defenses and reaching the rear areas . The resulting chaos , however , caused a breakdown in discipline among the Chinese soldiers , who began looting food and clothing instead of exploiting the situation . The defending Americans managed to destroy the Chinese forces in counterattacks , while a breakdown of communications between the Chinese regiments allowed the gaps to close . When the fighting stopped , the Chinese had only gained the East Hill on the northern perimeter . Another attack was planned for the night of 29 November , but air raids by VMF @-@ 542 broke up the Chinese formations before it could be carried out . 
 Given the critical manpower shortage at Hagaru @-@ ri , on November 29 , Smith ordered Colonel Lewis " Chesty " Puller of the First Marine Regiment to assemble a task force to be sent north from Koto @-@ ri to open the road south of Hagaru @-@ ri . In response , a task force was formed with 921 troops from the 41 Royal Marine Commando , G Company of the 1st Marines and B Company of the 31st Infantry . The task force was dubbed " Task Force Drysdale " after its commander Lieutenant Colonel Douglas B. Drysdale , who also commanded 41 Commando . On the afternoon of 29 November , Task Force Drysdale pushed north from Koto @-@ ri while under constant attack from the PVA 60th Division . The task force 's harrowing experience later earned the road the nickname " Hell Fire Valley " . As the Chinese attacks dragged on , the task force became disorganized , and a destroyed truck in the convoy later split the task force into two segments . Although the lead segment of the task force fought its way into Hagaru @-@ ri on the night of 29 November , the rear segment was destroyed . Despite suffering 159 wounded and 162 dead and missing , the task force managed to bring in 300 badly needed infantrymen for the defense at Hagaru @-@ ri . 
 As more reinforcements arrived from Hudong @-@ ni on 30 November , the garrisons attempted to recapture the East Hill . All efforts failed despite the destruction of a Chinese company . When darkness settled , the PVA 58th Division gathered its remaining 1 @,@ 500 soldiers in a last @-@ ditch attempt to capture Hagaru @-@ ri . The reinforced defenders annihilated most of the attacking forces , with only the defences around the East Hill giving way . As the Chinese tried to advance from the East Hill , they were cut down by the 31st Tank Company . 
 By 1 December , the PVA 58th Division was virtually destroyed , with the remainder waiting for reinforcements from the 26th Corps of the 9th Army . But much to the frustration of Song Shi @-@ Lun , the 26th Corps did not arrive before the Marines broke out of Yudam @-@ ni . The airfield was opened to traffic on 1 December , allowing UN forces to bring in reinforcements and to evacuate the dead and the wounded . With the Marines at Yudam @-@ ni completing their withdrawal on 4 December , the trapped UN forces could finally start their breakout towards the port of Hungnam . 
 = = = Breakout = = = 
 After a short period of rest , the breakout began on 6 December with the 7th Marines as the vanguard of the retreating column while the 5th Marines covered the rear . At the same time , the much @-@ delayed PVA 26th Corps arrived at Hagaru @-@ ri with its 76th and 77th Division relieving the 58th and 60th Divisions . As the 7th Marines pushed aside the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru @-@ ri , the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru @-@ ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division . In a last effort to stop the breakout , the customary Chinese night attack returned with the 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru @-@ ri perimeter from all directions . The Marines repulsed the Chinese attacks , inflicting heavy casualties . 
 Meanwhile , the 7th Marines opened the road between Hagaru @-@ ri and Koto @-@ ri by capturing the high ground surrounding the road . But as soon as the Marines pulled out , the 77th Division returned to the peaks and attacked the column . Chaotic fighting broke out within the column and the retreat was slowed to a crawl . The Marine night fighters , however , returned to subdue the Chinese forces , and the fighting destroyed most of the blocking troops . On 7 December , the rest of the column managed to reach Koto @-@ ri with little difficulty with the last elements arrived at Koto @-@ ri that night . 
 After the failure of the 26th Corps at Hagaru @-@ ri , the PVA High Command ordered the 26th and the 27th Corps to chase the escaping UN force with the 20th Corps blocking the escape route . But with most of the 20th Corps destroyed at Yudam @-@ ni and Hagaru @-@ ri , the only forces between Koto @-@ ri and Hungnam were the remnants of the 58th and the 60th Divisions . In desperation , Song Shi @-@ Lun ordered these troops to dig in at Funchilin Pass while blowing up the vital <unk> bridge , hoping the terrain and obstacles would allow the 26th and the 27th Corps to catch up with the retreating UN forces . The PVA 180th Regiment that occupied Hill 1081 blew up the original concrete bridge and two improvised replacements in succession , believing the bridge was rendered irreparable . In response , 1st Battalion , 1st Marines ( 1 / 1 ) attacked Hill 1081 from the south , and the hill was captured on 9 December after the defenders fought to the last man . At the same time , the 7th Marines and RCT @-@ 31 attacked the <unk> bridge from the north , only to encounter defenders that were already frozen in their foxholes . 
 With the path to Hungnam blocked at Funchilin Pass , eight C @-@ 119 Flying Boxcars flown by the US 314th Troop Carrier Wing were used to drop portable bridge sections by parachute . The bridge , consisting of eight separate 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) long , 2 @,@ 900 lb ( 1 @,@ 300 kg ) sections , was dropped one section at a time , using a 48 ft ( 15 m ) parachute on each section . Four of these sections , together with additional wooden extensions were successfully reassembled into a replacement bridge by Marine Corps combat engineers and the US Army 58th Engineer Treadway Bridge Company on 9 December , enabling UN forces to proceed . <unk> , the PVA 58th and 60th Divisions still tried to slow the UN advance with ambushes and raids , but after weeks of non @-@ stop fighting , the two Chinese divisions combined had only 200 soldiers left . The last UN forces left Funchilin Pass by 11 December . 
 One of the last engagements during the withdrawal was an ambush at <unk> by the pursuing PVA 89th Division , which Task Force Dog of the 3rd Infantry Division repulsed with little difficulty . The trapped UN forces finally reached the Hungnam perimeter by 21 : 00 on 11 December . 
 = = = Evacuation at Hungnam = = = 
 By the time the UN forces arrived at Hungnam , MacArthur had already ordered the evacuation of the US X Corps on 8 December in order to reinforce the US Eighth Army , which by then was badly depleted and retreating rapidly towards the 38th parallel . Following his orders , the ROK I Corps , the ROK 1st Marine Regiment , the US 3rd Infantry Division and the US 7th Infantry Division had also set up defensive positions around the port . Some skirmishes broke out between the defending US 7th , 17th and 65th Infantry and the pursuing PVA 27th Corps , but against the strong naval gun fire support provided by US Navy Task Force 90 , the badly mauled 9th Army was in no shape to approach the Hungnam perimeter . 
 In what US historians called the " greatest evacuation movement by sea in US military history " , a 193 @-@ ship armada assembled at the port and evacuated not only the UN troops , but also their heavy equipment and roughly a third of the Korean refugees . One Victory ship , the SS Meredith Victory evacuated 14 @,@ 000 refugees . The last UN unit left at 14 : 36 on 24 December , and the port was destroyed to deny its use to the Chinese and North Korean forces . The PVA 27th Corps entered Hungnam on the morning of 25 December . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 While the US X Corps was being evacuated from the eastern front , the US Eighth Army had already retreated to the 38th parallel on the western front in the aftermath of the Battle of the Ch 'ongch 'on River . With the entire UN front collapsing , the race to the Yalu was ended with the communist forces of China recapturing much of North Korea . The Korean War would drag on for another two and a half years before the armistice was signed on 27 July 1953 . Besides the loss of North Korea , the US X Corps and the ROK I Corps later reported a total of 10 @,@ 495 battle casualties , of which 4 @,@ 385 were from the US Marines , 3 @,@ 163 were from the US Army , 2 @,@ 812 were from South Koreans attached to American formations and 78 were from the British Royal Marines . Outside of the combat losses , the 1st Marine Division also reported 7 @,@ 338 non @-@ battle casualties due to the cold weather . 
 Despite the losses , the US X Corps preserved much of its strength . About 105 @,@ 000 soldiers , 98 @,@ 000 civilians , 17 @,@ 500 vehicles , and 350 @,@ 000 tons of supplies were shipped from Hungnam to Pusan , and they would later rejoin the war effort in Korea . Smith was credited for saving the US X Corps from destruction , while the 1st Marine Division , the 41 Royal Marine Commando and the Army 's RCT @-@ 31 were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their tenacity during the battle . Fourteen Marines , two Soldiers and one Navy pilot received the Medal of Honor , and all of the UN troops that served at Chosin were later honored with the nickname " The Chosin Few " . On 15 September 2010 , the Veterans of the Korean War Chosin Reservoir Battle memorial was unveiled by the United States Marine Corps Commandant General James T. Conway at Camp Pendleton . 
 China was also catapulted into the status of a major military power following the victory at Chosin , but the victory came with a staggering cost . With the escape of the US X Corps and the ROK I Corps , Mao 's vision for Chosin was not realized , and the failure caused Song Shi @-@ Lun to offer his resignation . At the same time , heavy casualties caused by both combat and poor logistical support destroyed much of the eight elite divisions under the 20th and the 27th Corps . Of those eight divisions , two divisions were forced to disband , and not until March 1951 did the 9th Army return to its normal strength and become combat effective . With the absence of nearly 40 percent of the Chinese forces in Korea in early 1951 , the heavy Chinese losses at Chosin ultimately enabled the UN forces to maintain a foothold in Korea . 
 = = = Operation Glory = = = 
 During the battle , UN casualties were buried at temporary grave sites along the road . Operation Glory took place from July to November 1954 , during which the dead of each side were exchanged . The remains of 4 @,@ 167 US Soldiers and Marines were exchanged for 13 @,@ 528 North Korean and Chinese dead . In addition , 546 civilians who died in UN prisoner of war camps were turned over to the South Korean government . After Operation Glory , 416 Korean War " unknowns " were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific . According to a Defense Prisoner of War / Missing Personnel Office ( <unk> ) white paper , 1 @,@ 394 names were also transmitted during " Operation Glory " from the Chinese and North Koreans , of which 858 proved to be correct . The 4 @,@ 167 returned remains were found to be 4 @,@ 219 individuals , of whom 2 @,@ 944 were found to be Americans , with all but 416 identified by name . Of the 239 Korean War unaccounted for , 186 are not associated with the Punchbowl unknowns . From 1990 to 1994 North Korea excavated and returned more than 208 sets of remains which possibly include 200 to 400 US servicemen , but very few have been identified due to the co @-@ mingling of remains . From 2001 to 2005 , more remains were recovered from the Chosin Battle site , and around 220 were recovered near the Chinese border between 1996 and 2006 . 
 = North Carolina Highway 102 = 
 North Carolina Highway 102 ( NC 102 ) is a 22 @.@ 3 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 35 @.@ 9 km ) state highway running from NC 903 near Ayden to U.S. Highway 17 ( US 17 ) between <unk> and <unk> . Most of the route is rural ; the only community it serves is <unk> . 
 NC 102 appeared on the first state highway map in 1924 , running from Snow Hill to Goldsboro . At its peak , the road stretched from US 17 at its current eastern terminus to US 301 north of Fayetteville . The routing from Interstate 95 ( I @-@ 95 ) to Snow Hill was renumbered as US 13 in 1977 , and the segment of the route from its current western terminus to Snow Hill was replaced by an extension of NC 903 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NC 102 begins at NC 903 west of Ayden . It then heads east until it reaches Ayden . After about two and a half miles ( 4 @.@ 2 km ) , NC 102 enters Ayden , and has an intersection with NC 11 . NC 102 continues through Ayden along 3rd Street , and in the heart of Ayden crosses a CSX rail line . From there NC 102 then continues east out of Ayden still along 3rd Street . After leaving Ayden , NC 102 enters a very rural area with many farms and small forests . About a mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) further east NC 102 has a junction with Ayden Golf Club Road . As NC 102 continues to the east it crosses Fork Swamp and has a junction with County Home Road ( Secondary Road 1725 , or SR 1725 ) . 
 About a mile to the east ( 1 @.@ 3 km ) the road turns to head in a southeastern direction instead of the eastern direction of most of the route . The routing along this part of the road almost parallels NC 43 to the east of the road . 3 @.@ 7 miles ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) after the road turned in a southeastern direction . NC 102 intersects <unk> – <unk> Road ( SR 1753 ) . The road continues across <unk> Swamp before the intersection with NC 43 . The route continues eastward from that intersection and crosses Creeping Swamp and Gorham Swamp before crossing over a railroad owned by Norfolk Southern . Immediately after NC 102 crosses the railroad tracks , it ends at US 17 . 
 = = History = = 
 NC 102 first appeared on the 1924 first official state map running from NC 10 ( present day US 70 Business ) to NC 12 in Snow Hill . The 1930 North Carolina state map shows that a section of NC 102 was built from NC 60 north of Fayetteville to NC 22 in Sampson County . This section was not connected to the rest of NC 102 which had also been extended south of Goldsboro to Newton Grove . By 1931 the two sections of NC 102 were connected with NC 102 running a short concurrency with NC 23 south of Newton Grove . Between 1931 and 1936 , the road was extended to its current eastern terminus at US 17 . The road had a short concurrency with US 258 from Snow Hill to three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) to the northeast . Between 1931 and 1938 , NC 102 was rerouted in Goldsboro leaving NC 102A the old route . 
 In 1941 , NC 102 was routed onto US 13 through Newton Grove . Around 1953 the road was routed back onto its original routing through Goldsboro , eliminating NC 102A . Between 1956 and 1957 , US 13 was extended along NC 102 from Snow Hill to US 70 east of Goldsboro . In 1958 , NC 102 was routed along a freeway around Goldsboro , along with US 70 and US 117 . Between 1958 and 1961 , NC 102 was routed onto new routing , which is currently US 13 . Between the years of 1961 and 1963 , the section of routing between US 301 and I @-@ 95 was downgraded to a secondary road . During the same time the routing between I @-@ 95 and Snow Hill was renumbered as US 13 . In 1977 , NC 102 was truncated to its current western terminus . The routing it left behind was used to extend NC 903 . The routing of NC 102 has stayed the same since 1977 .

 = International Bank for Reconstruction and Development = 
 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) is an international financial institution that offers loans to middle @-@ income developing countries . The IBRD is the first of five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington , D.C. , United States . It was established in 1944 with the mission of financing the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II . The IBRD and its concessional lending arm , the International Development Association , are collectively known as the World Bank as they share the same leadership and staff . Following the reconstruction of Europe , the Bank 's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide economic development and eradicating poverty . The IBRD provides commercial @-@ grade or concessional financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure , education , domestic policy , environmental consciousness , energy investments , healthcare , access to food and potable water , and access to improved sanitation . 
 The IBRD is owned and governed by its member states , but has its own executive leadership and staff which conduct its normal business operations . The Bank 's member governments are shareholders which contribute paid @-@ in capital and have the right to vote on its matters . In addition to contributions from its member nations , the IBRD acquires most of its capital by borrowing on international capital markets through bond issues . In 2011 , it raised $ 29 billion USD in capital from bond issues made in 26 different currencies . The Bank offers a number of financial services and products , including flexible loans , grants , risk guarantees , financial derivatives , and catastrophic risk financing . It reported lending commitments of $ 26 @.@ 7 billion made to 132 projects in 2011 . 
 = = History = = 
 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) were established by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946 . The IBRD was established with the original mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war @-@ torn European nations following World War II , with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan . The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $ 250 million ( $ 2 @.@ 6 billion in 2012 dollars ) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects . The institution also established its first field offices in Paris , France , Copenhagen , Denmark , and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia . Throughout the remainder of the 1940s and 1950s , the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers , generate electricity , and improve access to water and sanitation . It also invested in France , Belgium , and Luxembourg 's steel industry . Following the reconstruction of Europe , the Bank 's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world . In 1960 , the International Development Association ( IDA ) was established to serve as the Bank 's concessional lending arm and provide low and no @-@ cost finance and grants to the poorest of the developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The IBRD is governed by the World Bank 's Board of Governors which meets annually and consists of one governor per member country ( most often the country 's finance minister or treasury secretary ) . The Board of Governors delegates most of its authority over daily matters such as lending and operations to the Board of Directors . The Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group . The executive directors collectively represent all 189 member states of the World Bank . The president oversees the IBRD 's overall direction and daily operations . As of July 2012 , Jim Yong Kim serves as the President of the World Bank Group . The Bank and IDA operate with a staff of approximately 10 @,@ 000 employees . 
 = = Funding = = 
 Although members contribute capital to the IBRD , the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds . The Bank raised $ 29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies .

 = French colonization of Texas = 
 The French colonization of Texas began with Fort Saint Louis in present @-@ day southeastern Texas . It was established in 1685 near <unk> Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle . He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River , but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles ( 640 km ) to the west , off the coast of Texas . The colony survived until 1688 . The present @-@ day town of Inez is near the fort 's site . 
 = = History = = 
 The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence , including Native Americans defending their homeland , epidemics , and harsh conditions . From that base , La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River . These did not succeed , but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas . 
 During one of his absences in 1686 , the colony 's last ship was wrecked , leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean . As conditions deteriorated , La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north , along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers . His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687 , when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny . 
 Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country , help never made it to Fort St. Louis . Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688 , four children survived after being adopted as captives . Although the colony lasted only three years , it established France 's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas . The United States later claimed , unsuccessfully , this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony . 
 Spain learned of La Salle 's mission in 1686 . Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain 's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America , the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate the settlement . The unsuccessful expeditions helped Spain to better understand the geography of the Gulf Coast region . When the Spanish finally discovered the remains of the French colony at Fort Saint Louis in 1689 , they buried the cannons and burned the buildings . Years later , Spanish authorities built a presidio at the same location . When the presidio was abandoned , the site of the French settlement was lost to history . 
 Fort Saint Louis was rediscovered by historians and excavated in 1996 , and the area is now an archaeological site . In 1995 , researchers located the ship La Belle in Matagorda Bay , with several sections of the hull remaining virtually intact . They constructed a cofferdam , the first to be used in North America , to excavate the ship as if in dry conditions . In 2000 , excavations revealed three of the original structures of the fort , as well as three graves of Frenchmen .

 By the late 17th century , much of North America had been claimed by European countries . Spain had claimed Florida as well as modern @-@ day Mexico and much of the southwestern part of the continent . The northern and central Atlantic coast was claimed by Britain , and New France comprised much of what is now Canada as well as the central Illinois Country . The French feared that their territory was vulnerable to the expansionist aims of its neighbors . In 1681 , French nobleman Robert Cavelier de La Salle launched an expedition down the Mississippi River from New France , at first believing he would find a path to the Pacific Ocean . Instead , La Salle found a route to the Gulf of Mexico . Although Hernando De Soto had explored and claimed this area for Spain 140 years before , on April 9 , 1682 , La Salle claimed the Mississippi River valley for French king Louis XIV , naming the territory Louisiana in his honor . 
 Unless France established a base at the mouth of the Mississippi , Spain would have an opportunity to control the entire Gulf of Mexico and potentially pose a threat to New France 's southern borders . La Salle believed that the Mississippi River was near the eastern edge of New Spain . On his return to France in 1684 , he proposed to the Crown the establishment of a colony at the mouth of the river . The colony could provide a base for promoting Christianity among the native peoples as well as a convenient location for attacking the Spanish province of Nueva Vizcaya and gaining control of its lucrative silver mines . He argued that a small number of Frenchmen could successfully invade New Spain by allying themselves with some of the more than 15 @,@ 000 Native Americans who were angry over Spanish enslavement . After Spain declared war on France in October 1667 , King Louis agreed to support La Salle 's plan . He was to return to North America and confirm " the Indians ' allegiance to the crown , leading them to the true faith , and maintaining intertribal peace " . 
 = = = Second expedition = = = 
 La Salle originally planned to sail to New France , journey overland to the south and Illinois Country , and then travel down the Mississippi River to its mouth . To spite Spain , Louis XIV insisted that La Salle sail through the Gulf of Mexico , which Spain considered its exclusive property . Although La Salle had requested only one ship , on July 24 , 1684 , he left La Rochelle , France with four : the 36 @-@ gun man of war Le Joly , the 300 @-@ ton storeship L 'Aimable , the barque La Belle , and the ketch St. François . Although Louis XIV had provided both Le Joly and La Belle , La Salle desired more cargo space and leased L 'Aimable and St. François from French merchants . Louis also provided 100 soldiers and full crews for the ships , as well as funds to hire skilled workers to join the expedition . La Salle was forced to purchase trade goods himself for expected encounters with Native Americans . . 
 The ships carried a total of nearly 300 people , including soldiers , artisans and craftsmen , six Catholic missionaries , eight merchants , and over a dozen women and children . Shortly after their departure , France and Spain ceased hostilities , and Louis was no longer interested in sending La Salle further assistance . Details of the voyage were kept secret so that Spain would not learn about it . La Salle 's naval commander , the Sieur de Beaujeu , resented La Salle 's keeping their destination until the party was well underway . The discord between the two intensified when they reached the island of Santo Domingo and quarreled over where to anchor . Beaujeu sailed to another part of the island , allowing Spanish privateers to capture the St. François , which had been fully loaded with supplies , provisions , and tools for the colony . 
 During the 58 @-@ day voyage , two people died of illness and one woman gave birth to a child . The voyage to Santo Domingo had lasted longer than expected , and provisions ran low , especially after the loss of the St. François . La Salle had little money with which to replenish supplies , and finally two of the merchants aboard the expedition sold some of their trade goods to the islanders , and lent their profits to La Salle . To fill the gaps left after several men deserted , La Salle recruited a few islanders to join the expedition . 
 In late November 1684 , when La Salle had fully recovered from a severe illness , the three remaining ships continued their search for the Mississippi River delta . Before they left Santo Domingo , local sailors warned that strong Gulf currents flowed east and would tug the ships toward the Florida straits unless they corrected for it . On December 18 , the ships reached the Gulf of Mexico and entered waters that Spain claimed as its territory . None of the members of the expedition had ever been in the Gulf of Mexico or knew how to navigate it . Due to a combination of inaccurate maps , La Salle 's previous miscalculation of the latitude of the mouth of the Mississippi River , and <unk> for the currents , the expedition failed to find the Mississippi . Instead , they landed at Matagorda Bay in early 1685 , 400 miles ( 640 km ) west of the Mississippi .
