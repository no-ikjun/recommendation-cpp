 Once again facing the New England Patriots , the New York Giants headed to Lucas Oil Stadium , home of Eli 's brother Peyton 's team , the Indianapolis Colts . The Giants got off to an early lead by an intentional grounding call on Tom Brady in the end zone for a safety and retaining the ball for most of the 1st quarter . However , New England came back and battled to a 10 – 9 lead . Nearing the end of the 4th quarter with the Giants behind 17 – 15 , Patriots coach Bill Belichick allowed them to score a touchdown with the idea that they would have nearly a minute to drive downfield and score . However , the New York defense held and broke up several Brady pass attempts . A last @-@ second throw into the end zone by the Patriots QB was thwarted and the Giants had won their second Super Bowl 21 – 17 in four years at New England 's expense .

 Animal navigation is the ability of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments . Birds such as the Arctic tern , insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds , and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances . 
 Dead reckoning , navigating from a known position using only information about one 's own speed and direction , was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 as a possible mechanism . In the 20th century , Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun , by the polarization pattern of the blue sky , and by the earth 's magnetic field ; of these , they rely on the sun when possible . William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use of a range of navigational cues , including the sun , earth 's magnetic field , olfaction and vision . Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird , the Manx shearwater , could orient themselves and fly home at full speed , when released far from home , provided either the sun or the stars were visible . 
 Several species of animal can integrate cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively . Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction ( from the earth 's magnetic field or from the sky ) to identify where they are and so to navigate . Internal ' maps ' are often formed using vision , but other senses including olfaction and echolocation may also be used . 
 The ability of wild animals to navigate may be adversely affected by products of human activity . For example , there is evidence that pesticides may interfere with bee navigation , and that lights may harm turtle navigation . 
 = = Early research = = 
 In 1873 , Charles Darwin wrote a letter to Nature magazine , arguing that animals including man have the ability to navigate by dead reckoning , even if a magnetic ' compass ' sense and the ability to navigate by the stars is present : 
 With regard to the question of the means by which animals find their way home from a long distance , a striking account , in relation to man , will be found in the English translation of the Expedition to North Siberia , by Von Wrangell . He there describes the wonderful manner in which the natives kept a true course towards a particular spot , whilst passing for a long distance through hummocky ice , with incessant changes of direction , and with no guide in the heavens or on the frozen sea . He states ( but I quote only from memory of many years standing ) that he , an experienced surveyor , and using a compass , failed to do that which these savages easily effected . Yet no one will suppose that they possessed any special sense which is quite absent in us . We must bear in mind that neither a compass , nor the north star , nor any other such sign , suffices to guide a man to a particular spot through an intricate country , or through hummocky ice , when many deviations from a straight course are inevitable , unless the deviations are allowed for , or a sort of " dead reckoning " is kept . All men are able to do this in a greater or less degree , and the natives of Siberia apparently to a wonderful extent , though probably in an unconscious manner . This is effected chiefly , no doubt , by eyesight , but partly , perhaps , by the sense of muscular movement , in the same manner as a man with his eyes blinded can proceed ( and some men much better than others ) for a short distance in a nearly straight line , or turn at right angles , or back again . The manner in which the sense of direction is sometimes suddenly <unk> in very old and feeble persons , and the feeling of strong distress which , as I know , has been experienced by persons when they have suddenly found out that they have been proceeding in a wholly unexpected and wrong direction , leads to the suspicion that some part of the brain is specialised for the function of direction . 
 Later in 1873 , Joseph John Murphy replied to Darwin , writing back to Nature with a description of how he , Murphy , believed animals carried out dead reckoning , by what is now called inertial navigation : 
 If a ball is freely suspended from the roof of a railway carriage it will receive a shock sufficient to move it , when the carriage is set in motion : and the magnitude and direction of the shock … will depend on the magnitude and direction of the force with which the carriage begins to move … [ and so ] … every change in … the motion of the carriage … will give a shock of corresponding magnitude and direction to the ball . Now , it is conceivably quite possible , though such delicacy of mechanism is not to be hoped for , that a machine should be constructed … for registering the magnitude and direction of all these shocks , with the time at which each occurred … from these data the position of the carriage … might be calculated at any moment . 
 Karl von Frisch ( 1886 – 1982 ) studied the European honey bee , demonstrating that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways : by the sun , by the polarization pattern of the blue sky , and by the earth ’ s magnetic field . He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass ; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive . 
 William Tinsley Keeton ( 1933 – 1980 ) studied homing pigeons , showing that they were able to navigate using the earth 's magnetic field , the sun , as well as both olfactory and visual cues . 
 Donald Griffin ( 1915 – 2003 ) studied echolocation in bats , demonstrating that it was possible and that bats used this mechanism to detect and track prey , and to " see " and thus navigate through the world around them . 
 Ronald Lockley ( 1903 – 2000 ) , among many studies of birds in over fifty books , pioneered the science of bird migration . He made a twelve @-@ year study of shearwaters such as the Manx shearwater , living on the remote island of Skokholm . These small seabirds make one of the longest migrations of any bird — 10 @,@ 000 kilometres — but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year . This behaviour led to the question of how they navigated . 
 = = Mechanisms = = 
 Lockley began his book Animal Navigation with the words : 
 How do animals find their way over apparently trackless country , through pathless forests , across empty deserts , over and under featureless seas ? ... They do so , of course , without any visible compass , sextant , chronometer or chart ... 
 Many mechanisms have been proposed for animal navigation : there is evidence for a number of them . Investigators have often been forced to discard the simplest hypotheses - for example , some animals can navigate on a dark and cloudy night , when neither landmarks nor celestial cues like sun , moon , or stars are visible . The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below . 
 = = = Remembered landmarks = = = 
 Animals including mammals , birds and insects such as bees and wasps ( Ammophila and <unk> ) , are capable of learning landmarks in their environment , and of using these in navigation . 
 = = = Orientation by the sun = = = 
 Some animals can navigate using celestial cues such as the position of the sun . Since the sun moves in the sky , navigation by this means also requires an internal clock . Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their circadian rhythm . Animals that use sun compass orientation are fish , birds , sea @-@ turtles , butterflies , bees , sandhoppers , reptiles , and ants . 
 When sandhoppers ( such as <unk> saltator ) are taken up a beach , they easily find their way back down to the sea . It has been shown that this is not simply by moving downhill or towards the sight or sound of the sea . A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day / night cycle under artificial lighting , whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle . Then , the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight . They moved away from the sea , up the beach . The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading , and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach . 
 Experiments with Manx shearwaters showed that when released " under a clear sky " far from their nests , the seabirds first oriented themselves and then flew off in the correct direction . But if the sky was overcast at the time of release , the shearwaters flew around in circles . 
 Monarch butterflies use the sun as a compass to guide their southwesterly autumn migration from Canada to Mexico . 
 = = = Orientation by the night sky = = = 
 In a pioneering experiment , Lockley showed that warblers placed in a planetarium showing the night sky oriented themselves towards the south ; when the planetarium sky was then very slowly rotated , the birds maintained their orientation with respect to the displayed stars . Lockley observes that to navigate by the stars , birds would need both a " sextant and chronometer " : a built @-@ in ability to read patterns of stars and to navigate by them , which also requires an accurate time @-@ of @-@ day clock . 
 In 2003 , the African dung beetle <unk> <unk> was shown to navigate using polarization patterns in moonlight , making it the first animal known to use polarized moonlight for orientation . In 2013 , it was shown that dung beetles can navigate when only the Milky Way or clusters of bright stars are visible , making dung beetles the only insects known to orient themselves by the galaxy . 
 = = = Orientation by polarised light = = = 
 Some animals , notably insects such as the honey bee , are sensitive to the polarisation of light . Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky , relative to the compass direction they intend to travel . Karl von Frisch 's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source ( typically a patch of nectar @-@ bearing flowers ) . A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance . The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction , though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so , or are simply stimulated to go and search for food . However , bees are certainly able to remember the location of food , and to navigate back to it accurately , whether the weather is sunny ( in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks ) or largely overcast ( when polarised light may be used ) . 
 = = = Magnetoreception = = = 
 Some animals , including mammals such as blind mole rats ( <unk> ) and birds such as pigeons , are sensitive to the earth 's magnetic field . 
 Homing pigeons use magnetic field information with other navigational cues . Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time @-@ shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly on a clear sunny day , but could do so on an overcast day , suggesting that the birds prefer to rely on the direction of the sun , but switch to using a magnetic field cue when the sun is not visible . This was confirmed by experiments with magnets : the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted . 
 = = = Olfaction = = = 
 Olfactory navigation has been suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons . Papi 's ' mosaic ' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area , recognizing where they are by the local odour . <unk> 's ' gradient ' model argues that there is a steady , large @-@ scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods . If there were two or more such gradients in different directions , pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours . However it is not clear that such stable gradients exist . Papi did find evidence that <unk> pigeons ( unable to detect odours ) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons , so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation . However , it is not clear how olfactory cues are used . 
 Olfactory cues may be important in salmon , which are known to return to the exact river where they hatched . Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers . Salmon may use their magnetic sense to navigate to within reach of their river , and then use olfaction to identify the river at close range . 
 = = = Other senses = = = 
 Biologists have considered other senses that may contribute to animal navigation . Many marine animals such as seals are capable of hydrodynamic reception , enabling them to track and catch prey such as fish by sensing the disturbances their passage leaves behind in the water . Marine mammals such as dolphins , and many species of bat , are capable of echolocation , which they use both for detecting prey and for orientation by sensing their environment . 
 = = Path integration = = 
 Dead reckoning , in animals usually known as path integration , means the putting together of cues from different sensory sources within the body , without reference to visual or other external landmarks , to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path that is not necessarily straight . Seen as a problem in geometry , the task is to compute the vector to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point . 
 Since Darwin 's On the Origins of Certain Instincts ( quoted above ) in 1873 , path integration has been shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants , rodents and birds . When vision ( and hence the use of remembered landmarks ) is not available , such as when animals are navigating on a cloudy night , in the open ocean , or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts , path integration must rely on <unk> cues from within the body . 
 Studies by Wehner in the Sahara desert ant ( Cataglyphis bicolor ) demonstrate effective path integration to determine directional heading ( by polarized light or sun position ) and to compute distance ( by monitoring leg movement or optical flow ) . 
 Path integration in mammals makes use of the vestibular organs , which detect accelerations in the three dimensions , together with motor <unk> , where the motor system tells the rest of the brain which movements were commanded , and optic flow , where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes . Information from other senses such as echolocation and <unk> may also be integrated in certain animals . The hippocampus is the part of the brain that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal 's relative position in space . 
 David <unk> states that " The carefully controlled experiments of <unk> and <unk> ( 1980 ) and Etienne ( 1987 ) have demonstrated conclusively that [ path integration in mammals ] is a consequence of integrating internal cues from vestibular signals and motor efferent copy " . 
 = = Effects of human activity = = 
 <unk> pesticides may impair the ability of bees to navigate . Bees exposed to low levels of thiamethoxam were less likely to return to their colony , to an extent sufficient to compromise a colony 's survival . 
 Light pollution attracts and disorients <unk> animals , those that follow light . For example , hatchling sea turtles follow bright light , particularly bluish light , altering their navigation . Disrupted navigation in moths can easily be observed around bright lamps on summer nights . Insects gather around these lamps at high densities instead of navigating naturally .

 Hendrik Pieter Nicolaas " Henk " Muller , GON , RNL , FRGS ( 2 April 1859 – 11 August 1941 ) was a Dutch businessman , diplomat , explorer , publicist , and philanthropist . He was a son of Hendrik Muller <unk> . , a Rotterdam @-@ based Dutch businessman and politician , and Marie <unk> van Rijckevorsel , member of another prominent Rotterdam based business family . 
 Muller started his career as a businessman , trading with East and West Africa . In his mid @-@ twenties he travelled to Zanzibar , Mozambique , and South Africa for business purposes , but showed himself a keen ethnographer as well , collecting ethnographic artefacts and writing reports about the societies and people he encountered on his way . In 1890 , Muller retired from business for personal reasons , and went to Germany to study ethnography and geography . He graduated with a PhD dissertation four years later . 
 In 1896 he was first appointed consul and later consul general for the Orange Free State . Muller held this position all through the Second Boer War and his high @-@ profile performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable fame and notoriety , which lasted all his life . After the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed in 1902 Muller retired to a life of travelling and writing for some years , making Muller a household name with his travel books . In 1919 the Dutch government appointed him envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Romania , and later to Czechoslovakia , where he retired in 1932 . As diplomat Muller strongly promoted Dutch business interests , especially in oil and <unk> . 
 Muller was a prolific writer . Over the course of his life he published well over two hundred articles , brochures , and books about his travels through the world , about South Africa and the Boers , and about Dutch foreign policy and diplomacy , apart from a range of other subjects . Muller gathered a large fortune with well appointed private investments . He bequeathed his considerable wealth to a private fund in support of academic research and cultural heritage . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life as businessman = = = 
 Hendrik Pieter Nicolaas Muller was born in Rotterdam ( Netherlands ) on 2 April 1859 , as the third child and second son of Hendrik Muller <unk> and Marie <unk> van Rijckevorsel . His father was a successful businessman based in Rotterdam and trading with Africa and the Netherlands East Indies . H.P.N. Muller 's maternal grandfather , Abram van Rijckevorsel , was the doyen of the Rotterdam merchant community in the early part of the nineteenth century . Both his father and maternal grandfather were politicians as well , liberals who staunchly defended the principle of free trade , and both were at one time members of the Senate of the States @-@ General of the Netherlands . 
 Muller 's paternal grandfather was a German immigrant to the Netherlands and a <unk> ( Mennonite ) minister and professor of theology in Amsterdam . The Muller family was fairly prominent in the Netherlands in the nineteenth and early twentieth century , with Christian ministers , professors of literature and history , archivists , antiquarian booksellers , statesmen and businessmen in their midst . 
 Muller was destined to step into his father 's footsteps and become a businessman . He first attended the private institution <unk> followed by the <unk> <unk> ( high school ) in Rotterdam , before continuing his education in Germany , at the <unk> Real Schule in Frankfurt @-@ am @-@ Main , to specialise in trade and business . After finishing his studies with good results , he continued his training with internships in business firms in Liverpool , Manchester , and Marseilles . His first serious job came when his father called him back to Rotterdam in 1882 , to become interim manager of the <unk> Compagnie Mozambique ( Trading Company Mozambique ) , an ill @-@ performing trading firm doing business in Mozambique . In 1882 / ' 83 Muller travelled to East Africa and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm , changing business practices . At the end of his trip he made an extensive tour of South Africa , visiting Natal , Zululand , Transvaal , the Orange Free State , and the Cape Colony . On his return to Rotterdam he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities . Subsequently he was appointed co @-@ director of the reconstituted company , now called the Oost @-@ Afrikaansche Compagnie ( East African Company ) , as well as deputy manager in his father 's firm , Hendrik Muller & Co . , which had important trading interests in Liberia and elsewhere in West Africa . 
 In the 1880s Muller was active for his businesses , and travelled to the Congo Conference in Berlin in 1884 , to Portugal in 1886 and North Africa in 1889 . In the same year he succeeded his father as consul general for Liberia in the Netherlands , a position he would hold until 1913 . After a third business journey to Africa in 1890 , now to Liberia and the Gold Coast , for Hendrik Muller & Co . , he returned home seriously ill , and had to convalesce for months . In this period he fell out with his father and younger brother Abram Muller , about both personal and business matters . It was a personal break that would never be healed and with professional repercussions . In 1891 Muller left business for good and embarked on a totally new career . 
 = = = <unk> and geographer = = = 
 Already in the 1880s , Muller had dabbled in ethnography and writing . On the basis of materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882 / ’ 83 , he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium . He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers , and collated these publications into a book titled Zuid @-@ Afrika . It made him somewhat of a celebrity , and an expert on South Africa and East Africa . During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of ethnographic objects and artefacts , on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892 , together with Joh . F. <unk> , curator of the Africa collection in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde ( National Museum of Ethnology ) in Leiden . 
 Once freed from running the better part of two businesses , and financially independent , Muller went to Germany to study geography and ethnography . He attended lectures at the universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig before completing his doctorate at the University of Giessen in 1894 , summa cum laude . His thesis Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo ( Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo ) was mainly based on secondary material , rather than the materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in East Africa . This limited the originality of the study , although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work , and was also published in a commercial version . 
 = = = Consul general for the Orange Free State = = = 
 After his return to the Netherlands , H.P.N. Muller settled down in The Hague , where he was originally only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia , his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations ( since 1890 ) and his writing . Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the Orange Free State in the provinces of North and South Holland , assisting the consul general H.A.L. Hamelberg . He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa . After Hamelberg 's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general . It was an honorary position . In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange Free State and its interests in Europe . His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been consul general , but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers . Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange Free State in the Universal Postal Union , the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property , and the Geneva Conventions , and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany , Switzerland , and the Netherlands . He also strengthened the consular representation of the Orange Free State in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for rinderpest and improved methods of irrigation . 
 In 1898 Muller travelled to South Africa , where he visited Cape Town , the Orange Free State , and the Zuid @-@ Afrikaansche Republiek . In Pretoria he attended the inauguration of President Kruger and in Bloemfontein he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President M.T. Steyn and his family . He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen , like former President F.W. Reitz , government secretary P.J. <unk> , and chairman of the Volksraad C.H. Wessels . In Cape Town , he was granted an audience with High Commissioner Sir Alfred Milner . 
 Once back in the Netherlands , the political situation in South Africa became tense very rapidly , and Muller did all he could to propagate the cause of the Boer Republics in the press and via diplomatic channels . Once the South African War broke out in October 1899 , Muller set up an elaborate operation to support the cause of the war for the Orange Free State . He mobilised public support in the Netherlands , Germany and the United States of America and had public gatherings organised . Through his many contacts with the European press Muller saw to it that the Boer cause was extensively covered in the newspapers , usually in his own words , but published in the name of the respective editor . His office in The Hague was the hub of diplomatic and consular activity in this period , with several secretaries working continuously on the gathering of information and dealing with correspondence . In the war effort Muller cooperated with the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond in Dordrecht , the Nederlandsche Zuid @-@ Afrikaansche Vereeniging in Amsterdam , and of course the Transvaal 's diplomatic representative in Brussels , Dr. W.J. Leyds . Originally the relationship between Muller and Leyds was cordial , but with time it soured and turned into open animosity . Both men were strong personalities with strong convictions . The fact that Muller was only consul general and Leyds an accredited diplomat was not helpful either and neither was the fact that – at least in Muller 's opinion – the Zuid @-@ Afrikaansche Republiek received much more attention than the Orange Free State . The first time problems arose in the open was in 1900 , when the Boer Republics sent a joint Special Diplomatic Delegation to Europe and the United States , which was ill @-@ prepared and for which Leyds had very different ideas than Muller . 
 In 1901 Muller travelled to the United States himself to mobilise support from President Theodore Roosevelt , especially on behalf of the women and children in the British concentration camps . He also held public lectures all around the country . While visiting Mexico , news reached Muller about the Peace of Vereeniging , making him jobless . Muller took the opportunity to turn his American journey into an expedition . On his return to the Netherlands in 1903 he published a book about it . In the years after the end of the South African War Muller maintained his interest in South Africa and the Afrikaners , both personally and professionally . In 1904 he supported the Steyn family when they were in Europe for the President 's recovery of a debilitating illness . Until his death Muller was active for the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond and the Nederlandsche Zuid @-@ Afrikaansche Vereeniging . 
 = = = Travel through Asia = = = 
 Between 1907 and 1909 Muller travelled through Asia , a journey that produced several books and articles after his return , including a two @-@ part report of his travels ( Azië gespiegeld ; Asia mirrored ) . Muller also published a scientific source publication on Cambodia and the earliest Dutch presence in French Indochina . The French government rewarded him for it with a knighthood in the Légion d 'Honneur for the latter . The French colony Annam made Muller a knight in the Order of the Dragon for his contributions to the history of Vietnam . 
 Muller 's Asian trip was comprehensive . He visited British India and Ceylon , Burma , Malaysia and the Philippines and French Indochina , travelled extensively through the Dutch East Indies , and returned via Japan , Korea – where he had an audience with the last Korean emperor – , Manchuria , China , and Siberia . Muller 's visit to Japan triggered a lively interest in this country and its economic development potential . Back in the Netherlands he presented his views on the country in several speeches , brochures , and articles , mainly under the auspices of the Comité Nederland @-@ Japan ( Dutch @-@ Japanese Committee ) . 
 = = = Dutch government official and diplomat = = = 
 In 1914 , at the outbreak of World War I , Muller 's career took a new turn . The Dutch government appointed him government commissioner in charge of one of the main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands . Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in <unk> to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in <unk> . He took to the job with great enthusiasm , but resigned a year later , declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment . Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies . At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller 's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances . Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission , this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands . 
 From the 1890s onwards , Muller had published with great regularity about the importance of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world . In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised . In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs . In this vain , in 1919 , he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen ( Svalbard ) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands . A year later , the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty . 
 In 1919 , now already sixty years old , he got the chance to put his preachings on Dutch foreign policy into practice . In that year the Dutch government appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Romania , a country in the throes of political and economic transformation . The Dutch had had important business interests in the country , especially in petroleum . Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia . In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs , inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch <unk> firm Philips . 
 He resigned his post in 1932 after being requested to step back by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs , who wished to free some senior diplomatic posts for younger diplomats waiting to be appointed envoy . Muller decided not take his pension , allowing him to keep his title of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary until his death . 
 = = = Dutch history and heritage = = = 
 From an early age Muller was interested in Dutch history , especially in the great national achievements of the Dutch during the centuries . During his lifetime Muller translated his interests in several concrete projects . 
 In line with his historical interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered Grand Pensionary of Holland , Johan de Witt ( 1625 – 1672 ) . The statue was designed and made by the Dutch sculptor Frederik Engel <unk> . The unveiling in The Hague on 12 June 1918 was a national event . The actual unveiling was done by Queen Wilhelmina , with several ministers in attendance . The statue stands close to the place where De Witt and his brother Cornelis were killed by a mob in 1672 . On the side of the <unk> a text is engraved which – in translation – reads : ' Leader and servant of the Republic , designer of it most powerful fleets , defender of the freedom of the seas , caretaker of the State 's coffers , mathematician . He was a perfect Dutchman . ' Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text . 
 Muller funded the erection of a plaque in honour of the Dutch seventeenth @-@ century admiral Maarten <unk> . Tromp in the newly built City Hall of his birthplace Rotterdam . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 In the years after 1932 Muller travelled a little around Europe and retired to his house in The Hague . He remained involved in cultural and academic activities , organised his papers , and kept a keen interest in South African affairs . In the last years of his life he was honoured in several ways , among others with an honorary doctorate in law from the University of South Africa , a bust in the hall of the <unk> of the University of the Free State , with a copy in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde ( National Museum of Ethnology ) in Leiden , and an honorary diner party by the Royal Geographical Society in London . Without children and never fully reconciled with his family , Muller left almost his complete estate to the Dr. Hendrik Muller 's <unk> Fonds for the support of academic research and cultural heritage . Finally his health failed more and more and H.P.N. Muller died in his house in The Hague on 11 August 1941 . He was buried in the cemetery of Oud <unk> en <unk> in The Hague in a grand ceremony , with the Dutch flag covering the coffin and the national anthem being played , in defiance of the German Nazi occupation and as a – somewhat old @-@ fashioned – celebration of Dutch cultural identity . Among the attendants were several former government ministers and high @-@ ranking military officers , university professors , former diplomats , representatives of cultural and scientific organisations , and friends from his South African period and after . 
 During his lifetime H.P.N. Muller was well respected for his work . He was extensively decorated by almost all the countries he worked for or in , in many cases with the highest distinction . He was made a Knight Grand Cross in military and civilian orders of Portugal , Liberia , Romania , Bulgaria , Serbia , Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands , was commander of the French Legion of Honour , and knight in orders of Liberia , Annam and the Netherlands . Apart from having his bust placed in the University of the Free State , the Bloemfontein municipal authorities named a street after him . 
 Although highly decorated , honoured and well respected for his work , Muller was not an easy person . This shows through in a consistently bad press he received during his lifetime and after , which highlights his eccentricities and his at times volatile character .

 = Tropical Storm Grace ( 2003 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Grace was a weak tropical storm that struck Texas in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season . The eleventh tropical depression and the seventh tropical storm of the season , Grace was also the weakest storm of the season . On August 30 the storm developed from a long @-@ track tropical wave in the western Gulf of Mexico . Grace remained disorganized throughout its lifetime due to an upper level low to its west . The weak storm moved northwestward and made landfall on southeastern Texas . Grace quickly weakened over land , and dissipated on September 2 as it merged into a cold front . 
 In Texas , the storm dropped heavy rainfall , causing minor flash flooding damage . The cold front , combined with the remnants of the storm , dropped moderate to heavy rainfall from Texas through the Mid @-@ Atlantic . The worst of the flooding occurred in Indianapolis , where record rainfall affected over 700 homes . Despite the rainfall , damage was minimal along its path . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A strong tropical wave accompanied with a low pressure system moved off the coast of Africa on August 19 . It moved quickly westward and organized , developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection . The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21 , though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection . The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean , and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system . On August 24 , convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles , though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development . The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea , and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28 . The wave crossed the Yucatán Peninsula , and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico . Convection continued to organize , and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335 miles ( 540 km ) east @-@ southeast of Corpus Christi , Texas . 
 The depression moved to the northwest , and intensified into Tropical Storm Grace six hours after forming . Despite the increase in winds the center of circulation remained very broad , with Reconnaissance Aircraft having difficulty pinpointing the center . In addition , an upper level low located over Brownsville , Texas produced shear over the western portion of the system , which limited outflow to the east side . Forecasters predicted the upper level low to weaken , allowing for the possibility of Grace to intensify to a 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) tropical storm over warm waters . However , the upper level low remained in place and continued to produce shear across the system . A new center of circulation reformed 115 miles ( 185 km ) north of the original center , and made landfall near San Luis Pass on the southwestern portion of Galveston Island on August 31 as a minimal tropical storm . Grace quickly weakened to a tropical depression over land , and after turning northeastward into Oklahoma the depression was absorbed by a cold front . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Three hours after forming , officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings from High Island to Corpus Christi , Texas . Local National Weather Service offices requested a voluntary evacuation for western Galveston Island including Jamaica Beach , the Bolivar Peninsula , and coastal areas of Brazoria and Matagorda counties , though few residents heeded the warnings . Local emergency management officials predicted tides of up to 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) above normal with coastal flooding . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Grace produced moderate amounts of rainfall along its path , peaking in southern Texas . The storm later merged with a cold front , which later dropped heavy rainfall in the Mid @-@ West United States . In addition to its impact on the United States , the outer rainbands of Grace caused light rainfall in Yucatán and northern Tamaulipas . 
 = = = South @-@ Central United States = = = 
 Upon making landfall , Tropical Storm Grace produced a light storm surge of 3 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 m ) in Matagorda and North Jetty , Texas . Wind gusts peaked at 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) with sustained winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) at Sea Rim State Park . Locations closer to where the storm made landfall reported below tropical storm force winds , with the exception of Galveston which recorded a 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) wind gust . Rainfall was moderate to heavy across eastern Texas , peaking at 10 @.@ 36 inches ( 263 mm ) in Spindletop Bayou . The outer bands of Grace spawned a waterspout just south of the western tip of Galveston Island , prompting the issuance of a tornado warning . The waterspout dissipated before moving onshore . The storm also caused light beach erosion , though little occurred beyond the erosion caused by Hurricane Claudette one month prior . Near the coast , high tides from the storm flooded piers , bulkheads , and low @-@ lying areas . Further inland , heavy rainfall lead to flash flooding , covering roads and entering a few houses . Overall , damage was minor , and totaled to $ 113 @,@ 000 ( 2003 USD , $ 132 @,@ 400 2008 USD ) . 
 In Oklahoma , moisture from the storm , combined with a slow @-@ moving cold front , produced heavy rainfall across the state , peaking at 8 @.@ 98 inches ( 228 mm ) in Courtney . Due to below normal precipitation by as much as 5 to 10 inches ( 127 to 255 mm ) , flooding was localized and overall minimal . Near Medford , the rainfall lead to 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) deep flooding on U.S. Highway 81 , forcing its closure . The rainfall was welcome in the state , and lessened the rainfall deficit . 
 Tropical Storm Grace , combined with the slow @-@ moving cold front , produced light to moderate rainfall totals across the southern United States , including isolated locations in Louisiana and Mississippi reporting over 3 inches ( 76 mm ) and over 5 inches ( 127 mm ) in northeastern Arkansas . 
 = = = Ohio Valley and Eastern United States = = = 
 In Missouri , the cold front combined with moisture from the remnants of Grace brought temporary relief to a severe drought by producing light to moderate rainfall of up to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) in the southeastern portion of the state . In Poplar Bluff , the rainfall caused severe flooding , resulting in rescues for people in trapped vehicles . The moisture produced over 5 inches ( 127 mm ) in northern Kentucky , as well . 
 Moisture from the remnants of Grace dropped heavy rainfall across central Indiana , including a record one @-@ day total of 7 inches ( 178 mm ) in Indianapolis , while other locations received over 9 inches ( 228 mm ) . Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks , though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes . The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up the sewage system , sending hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage into the streets . Following the deluge in the state , the governor declared a state of emergency for the state . Eight local American Red Cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people . 
 The remnants of Grace dropped moderate to heavy rainfall eastward through the Mid @-@ Atlantic States and New England . Locations in extreme western Maryland and southeastern Virginia received over 5 inches ( 127 mm ) of rain . In Maryland , Hagerstown recorded 3 @.@ 94 inches ( 100 mm ) , resulting in flash flooding . In Washington County , the system produced 1 @.@ 09 inches ( 27 @.@ 8 mm ) of rain , a new daily record . Damage in Maryland , if any , was unknown . 
 = The Kentucky Headhunters = 
 The Kentucky Headhunters is an American country rock and Southern rock band . They were founded in 1968 as Itchy Brother , which consisted of brothers Richard Young ( rhythm guitar , vocals ) and Fred Young ( drums ) along with Greg Martin ( lead guitar , vocals ) and Anthony Kenney ( bass guitar , vocals ) . Itchy Brother performed together until 1982 , with James Harrison replacing Martin from 1973 to 1976 . The Young brothers and Martin began performing as The Kentucky Headhunters in 1986 , adding brothers Ricky Lee Phelps ( lead vocals , harmonica ) and Doug Phelps ( bass guitar , backing vocals ) to the membership . 
 With the release of their 1989 debut album Pickin ' on Nashville via Mercury Records , the band charted four consecutive Top 40 country singles . A second album for Mercury , Electric Barnyard , did not do as well commercially , and the Phelps brothers left after its release to form Brother Phelps . Kenney re @-@ joined and Mark S. Orr took over on lead vocals for 1993 's Rave On ! ! and a compilation album entitled The Best of The Kentucky Headhunters : Still Pickin ' before the band exited Mercury . Orr left and Doug Phelps rejoined in 1996 as lead vocalist for the album Stompin ' Grounds . He also led on the Audium Entertainment albums Songs from the Grass String Ranch and Soul , as well as Big Boss Man and a second compilation , Flying Under the Radar , on CBuJ Entertainment . After Kenney 's departure , Doug once again became the band 's bass guitarist by the release of its next album , Dixie Lullabies , in 2011 . 
 The Kentucky Headhunters have released eight studio albums , three compilations , and twenty @-@ three singles , of which the highest @-@ peaking is a cover of the Don Gibson song " Oh Lonesome Me , " which the band took to number 8 in 1990 . In addition , the band has won three Country Music Association awards , an Academy of Country Music award and a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal , won in 1990 for Pickin ' on Nashville . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 1968 – 1982 : Early years as Itchy Brother = = = 
 Richard Young , his younger brother Fred , and their cousins Anthony Kenney and Greg Martin began performing music in the Youngs ' and Kenney 's hometown of Glasgow , Kentucky in the 1960s . They founded a band called Itchy Brother , named after Fred 's favorite cartoon character , from King Leonardo and His Short Subjects . The band achieved regional success in Kentucky in the 1970s , including at least one single , " Shotgun Effie , " which they wrote about the Youngs ' grandmother , Effie . It was released in 1973 on the King Fargo label . That same year , Greg Martin left the group to play in another band in his hometown of Louisville , Kentucky . In the meantime , guitarist James Harrison took his place . Martin returned to the group in 1976 . 
 Itchy Brother was almost signed to Swan Song Records , an independent label founded by the band Led Zeppelin , in 1980 . The label closed after Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham died , and Itchy Brother never recorded a full album on Swan Song . Itchy Brother broke up in 1982 . After their disbanding , Richard started writing songs for Acuff @-@ Rose Music , and Fred became a backing musician for country singer Sylvia , who at the time was recording on RCA Records . Martin played bass guitar and sang backing vocals for Ronnie McDowell , then a recording artist for Curb Records , and Kenney stopped performing , although he continued to write songs with the Young brothers . 
 = = = 1986 – 1988 : Reunion with new name = = = 
 When Martin attempted to reunite Itchy Brother in 1985 , the Young brothers joined him , but Kenney declined . Martin invited Missouri Bootheel native Doug Phelps , also a member of McDowell 's band , to replace Kenney , and Doug brought his older brother Ricky Lee to sing lead vocals and play harmonica . The band decided to name themselves The Headhunters , taking the name from the term " <unk> , " which blues musician Muddy Waters used to indicate that he had supplanted another band in a gig . After discovering that other bands existed with that name , the band added " Kentucky " to its name and thus became The Kentucky Headhunters . The Kentucky Headhunters began performing together the following year , playing twice monthly on the 90 @-@ minute Chitlin ' Show , a radio program on <unk> in Munfordville , Kentucky . 
 = = = 1989 – 1990 : Debut album and early success = = = 
 The Kentucky Headhunters borrowed $ 4 @,@ 500 to record a demo album , which included seven original songs , plus covers of Bill Monroe 's " Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine , " Henson Cargill 's " Skip a Rope " and Don Gibson 's " Oh Lonesome Me . " Originally intended to be sold at the band 's live shows , the demo tape came to the attention of the Nashville music community . Although Martin said that the band had not seriously considered signing a record deal , the band pursued one through the suggestion of its manager , Mitchell Fox . Harold Shedd , a record producer who was then the head of Mercury Records , helped sign The Kentucky Headhunters to the label in 1989 . 
 Mercury released the demo in 1989 as The Kentucky Headhunters ' debut album , Pickin ' on Nashville . The album produced four singles , all of which reached top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks ( now Hot Country Songs ) chart . The first of these , the " Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine " cover , peaked at number 25 in December 1989 . After it came " Dumas Walker , " about a then @-@ 74 @-@ year @-@ old marbles player who owned a liquor store that the band frequented . According to Doug , Mercury Records was initially reluctant to release the song as a single : " [ The label ] thought it was too regional , and that no one outside the area would get it , but what they didn 't see , was the reaction we got to it every night that we played it in front of a crowd , and it didn 't matter where we were playing either . " The single peaked at number 15 on the Billboard chart . 
 Following " Dumas Walker " was the " Oh Lonesome Me " cover ; peaking at number eight , this was the band 's only Top Ten hit . Finishing off the single releases was the number 23 " Rock ' n ' Roll Angel " , which Richard wrote . Pickin ' on Nashville also earned the band a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal , Best New Vocal Group award from the Academy of Country Music ( ACM ) , and Album of the Year and Vocal Group of the Year awards from the Country Music Association ( CMA ) . In addition , it earned a double @-@ platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipping two million copies in the United States . William Ruhlmann of Allmusic gave the album a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half star rating out of five , saying that the band was " all the better " for having a sound closer to rock than country . After the success of their debut album , The Kentucky Headhunters began touring with Hank Williams , Jr. and Delbert McClinton . 
 = = = 1991 – 1992 : Second album and departure of the Phelps brothers = = = 
 In 1991 , the band released their second album , Electric Barnyard . Although the album earned a gold certification from the RIAA and a second CMA award for Vocal Group of the Year , its singles received little airplay compared to the band 's previous releases , with none of the four singles reaching the top 40 on the U.S. country charts . The album 's first single was a cover of " The Ballad of Davy Crockett , " which was released on the 155th anniversary of Davy Crockett 's death ; the single shipped to radio with promotional coonskin caps . It spent eleven weeks on the charts and peaked at 49 . " With Body and Soul " was the next single released , peaking at number 30 on the Canadian RPM country charts but reaching number 56 in the United States . The third and fourth singles were the original composition " It 's Chitlin ' Time " and a rendition of Waylon Jennings 's " Only Daddy That 'll Walk the Line , " at numbers 63 and 60 respectively . Norman Greenbaum 's 1969 single " Spirit in the Sky " was covered on this album as well . 
 This album was met with mixed reception from critics . Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly gave it an A rating , saying that it " skillfully blends raw wit , the working @-@ class energy of sweat @-@ stained factory workers jamming between shifts , and musical styles as diverse as the corny Tennessee Ernie Ford and the creamy Eric Clapton . " Allmusic critic Brian Mansfield , who gave it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars , called the band a " top @-@ notch Southern rock band with a sense of humor , " and said that the covers on Electric Barnyard were highlights , while the originals were " adequate , offbeat filler . " Randy Lewis of the Los Angeles Times called the band " ZZ Top lite " and said that most of the songs on the album had a " party @-@ hearty sound . " 
 Later in 1991 , The Kentucky Headhunters performed with Roy Rogers on the song " That 's How the West Was <unk> " from his Tribute album , and covered Canned Heat 's " Let 's Work Together " for the soundtrack to the film Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man . In addition , Martin played lead guitar for Canadian synthpop band Men Without Hats on its 1991 album Sideways and filled in for Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Ed King on that band 's 1992 tour , as King was injured at the time . 
 Ricky Lee and Doug departed in June 1992 due to creative differences . According to Richard , Ricky Lee 's tenure as lead vocalist was " a bad time " for the band given his opposition to Richard 's opinions , although Richard was still surprised to hear of the brothers ' departure , and said , " I tried everything I could to get them to stay . " Ricky Lee , meanwhile , said that he " was a country singer more than anything " and wanted to eliminate most of the band 's hard rock sounds . He and Doug then founded Brother Phelps , which had a more mainstream country sound than The Kentucky Headhunters did . Brother Phelps released two albums for Asylum Records and charted in the country top 40 with " Let Go " and " Were You Really Livin ' , " which peaked at number 6 and 28 respectively . 
 = = = 1992 – 1994 : New line @-@ up and lack of success = = = 
 Kenney rejoined in 1992 as bass guitarist , and Charlotte , Michigan native Mark S. Orr took over on lead vocals . The first album to feature Orr and Kenney , the more blues rock @-@ oriented Rave On ! ! , was released in 1993 . Although the band drew attention by touring with then @-@ labelmate Billy Ray Cyrus , Rave On ! ! sold poorly and failed to produce a successful single among its three releases : " Honky Tonk Walkin ' , " " Blue Moon of Kentucky " and " Dixie Fried , " the latter two being covers of Bill Monroe and Carl Perkins , respectively . The album also included a cover of The Lovin ' Spoonful 's " My Gal " . " Honky Tonk Walkin ' " and " Dixie Fried " respectively reached numbers 54 and 71 on the country charts , while the " Blue Moon of Kentucky " cover did not chart . 
 Mansfield gave a two @-@ star rating for Allmusic , where he wrote that the band had " devolved into a redneck boogie group . " Nash 's review for Entertainment Weekly gave it a C- grade , and called it " warmed @-@ over blues " that lacked the " outrageousness , wit , and brilliance that distinguished their earlier albums . " Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called it an " irresistible car @-@ stereo album , " and Rolling Stone critic John Swenson said that the album was more rock @-@ oriented than its predecessors , also saying that it " sounds like a hell of a blueprint for a summer concert tour . " 
 The Orr @-@ led lineup also recorded That 'll Work , a collaborative album with Chuck Berry 's pianist , Johnnie Johnson . It was released later in 1993 via Nonesuch Records , and it comprised twelve songs which Johnson and the band wrote over the course of four days . The album featured Johnson on piano , as well as lead vocals on the title track and one other song ; Jimmy Hall of Wet Willie also played harmonica and saxophone , and sang backing vocals . Thom Owens of Allmusic wrote of this album that " They certainly can work a heavy , bluesy groove with dexterity , but they lack the gonzo charm they had on their debut , Pickin ' on Nashville — there simply isn 't the sense of careening fun , nor is there the reckless fusions that resulted in such an invigorating listen . " One year later , Mercury released a greatest hits package , The Best of The Kentucky Headhunters : Still Pickin ' . It reprised singles and other songs from the band 's first three albums , as well as " Let 's Work Together " and a cover of The Beatles ' " You 've Got to Hide Your Love Away , " which The Kentucky Headhunters had previously recorded on the 1994 tribute album Shared Vision : The Songs of the Beatles . After Still Pickin ' , The Kentucky Headhunters left Mercury . 
 = = = 1995 – 2002 : Reunion with Doug Phelps = = = 
 Orr left The Kentucky Headhunters in August 1995 because he " was <unk> ' to do somethin ' else , " according to Richard . Richard then called Doug and invited him to rejoin the band . As a result , Brother Phelps disbanded and Ricky Lee pursued a solo career . In 1997 , The Kentucky Headhunters signed to BNA Records to release its fourth non @-@ collaborative studio album , Stompin ' Grounds , with Doug on lead vocals . This album was also an unsuccessful venture , failing to enter the country albums charts and producing only a number 70 @-@ peaking cover of Marty Robbins ' " Singing the Blues " . In order to promote the album , Richard suggested that the label send free copies to smaller @-@ market radio stations , where the band 's fanbase was still strong . He also considered the album 's original songs as the strongest that the band had ever written . Brian Wahlert of Country Standard Time magazine wrote that it " may be the band 's best album ever ; " Thom Owens gave the album two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars in his Allmusic review , where he wrote that the band " show [ ed ] a lack of imagination " and " sound [ ed ] considerably less energetic and exciting " than on the first two albums . 
 Songs from the Grass String Ranch , the band 's next album , was completed almost 18 months before its release . The band had consulted with 38 different independent labels before signing to Audium Entertainment , a branch of Koch Records ( now E1 Music ) , which released the album in 2000 . Three months before its release , Richard suffered a heart attack , from which he soon recovered . Because the " Singing the Blues " cover had been unsuccessful , the group decided to record entirely original songs for Songs from the Grass String Ranch . All five members co @-@ wrote all of the songs , with assistance from <unk> Dale Grissom on four of them . In addition , this album featured the Youngs on lead vocals for the first time : Fred on " Dry @-@ Land Fish " and Richard on " <unk> CoCo . " The title track was inspired by a nickname given to the Youngs ' family farm . " Too Much to Lose " was the album 's first single , peaking at number 66 on Billboard country chart . Richard considered this song an unusual single release because it was the band 's first ballad . Neither of the next two singles , " <unk> CoCo " and " Love That Woman , " appeared on the music charts . Giving it three stars out of five , Al Campbell of Allmusic said that it was " crowd @-@ pleasing " but " nothing out of the ordinary . " An uncredited review in The Ledger , which gave the album two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four , said that the up @-@ tempo songs were " nothing very original [ … ] but lots of fun " but added that its ballads were " mushy and earnest . "

 Soul followed in 2003 , also on Audium . This album also featured Johnnie Johnson , as well as guest appearances by organist Reese Wynans ( of Double Trouble ) , saxophone player Jim Horn , and a local musician named Robbie Bartlett , who sang guest vocals on " Everyday People . " It included the non @-@ charting single " Lonely Nights " and a tribute song to Carl Perkins entitled " Last Night I Met Carl Perkins " , as well as two covers : " I Still Wanna Be Your Man , " originally recorded by Eddie Hinton , and " Have You Ever Loved a Woman ? , " a blues standard made famous by Eric Clapton . This album received generally favorable reviews . Mark Deming gave a three @-@ star rating for Allmusic , saying that the album 's more rhythm and blues and soul @-@ influenced sound worked well due to the blues influences present in Southern rock , although he added that the album retained the " big guitar bombast " of the band 's previous works . Matt Bjorke of About.com considered its sound a departure from the earlier albums , but added " it 's not hard to see that the band fully enjoys what they are doing " and highlighted the presence of a horn section and Hammond B @-@ 3 organ on some tracks . Ray Waddell of Billboard magazine considered Wynans ' and Johnson 's contributions " perfect fits " , and noted that the album was " laid back " until the second half . His review also mentions the extended drum solo and " stone blues coda " of the closing track " What You See Is What You Get . " 
 In 2005 , following the closure of Audium , the band signed to the CBuJ Entertainment label . Its first release for the label was Big Boss Man , an album composed entirely of cover songs . This album was led off by its title track , a cover of the Jimmy Reed blues standard . Also released from it were renditions of Roger Miller 's " Chug @-@ a @-@ Lug " and Hank Williams ' " Take These Chains from My Heart " . The project was financed by Sony / ATV Music Publishing as a means of making extra money from older songs in the publishing company 's catalog . Richard helped select the songs for this album , which included three other Hank Williams covers , as well as Bob Dylan 's " Like a Rolling Stone , " The Beatles ' " I 'm Down , " and Patsy Cline 's " Walkin ' After Midnight , " among others . Despite saying that the album was " obviously aimed at longtime fans , " Greg Prato of Allmusic gave it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars , with his review making note of the " beefed @-@ up " Patsy Cline and Hank Williams covers . Ray Waddell of Billboard called the album " loose and rowdy , " saying that the band " injected soul " into the Dylan cover and recorded an " intoxicating " version of " Chug @-@ a @-@ Lug , " although he said that the " Hey Good Lookin ' " cover was " heavy @-@ handed . " Robert Woolridge gave a mostly @-@ favorable review for Country Standard Time , citing " Chug @-@ a @-@ Lug " and " So Sad to See Good Love Go Bad " ( originally by The Everly Brothers ) as the most country @-@ sounding . He also described three of the Hank Williams covers positively , but said that Phelps did not have a suitable vocal range for " I 'm Down " and that his voice was monotonous on " Walkin ' After Midnight .

 One year later , CBuJ Entertainment released the compilation Flying Under the Radar , which comprised selections from Songs from the Grass String Ranch , Soul and Big Boss Man , as well as two new songs and a remix of " Chug @-@ a @-@ Lug . " Kenney left the band around 2008 to take a job as the technical director of a theatre in Glasgow , Kentucky , and Doug has since taken over on bass guitar . 
 To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of Pickin ' on Nashville , the band released a live album entitled Authorized Bootleg : Live – <unk> Ballroom – Cleveland , Ohio . It was followed in October 2011 by Dixie Lullabies on the Red Dirt label , which the band recorded at the Practice House after touring with Jamey Johnson . William Ruhlmann gave this album a positive review , comparing the sound to The Rolling Stones and ZZ Top . 
 In April 2015 , the band released another collaborative album with Johnson entitled Meet Me in <unk> , via Alligator Records .

 The band 's members have also participated in several projects involving other artists . Richard Young co @-@ produced some tracks on <unk> Train 's self @-@ titled debut album , which was released on September 11 , 2007 by Show Dog Nashville , a label owned by Toby Keith ( now part of Show Dog @-@ Universal Music ) . This album includes the song " Truck Stop in the Sky , " which Richard and Fred co @-@ wrote with two of <unk> Train 's members , brothers Brent Flynn and David Flynn . Also in 2007 , Greg Martin released a gospel rock album called The Mighty <unk> as a side project . The album features Jimmy Hall and Jeff Beck , plus appearances by members of The Kentucky Headhunters , Phil <unk> , Darrell Mansfield ( for whom Martin has previously played ) , and others . Martin also played for Hall on his 2007 album Build Your Own Fire , a tribute album to Eddie Hinton . In 2009 , Martin began a side project called Rufus Huff with Chris Hardesty , Dean Smith , and Jarrod England . This side project released an album via <unk> Music in April 2009 . 
 Richard , along with Stan Webb and former MCA Nashville Records artist Marty Brown , wrote Tracy Byrd 's 1998 single " I 'm from the Country . " Brown and the band also recorded the song 's demo version . Richard 's son , John Fred Young , plays drums in the rock band Black Stone Cherry . The band practices at the same farm house where The Kentucky Headhunters once rehearsed . 
 = = Musical styles = = 
 The band 's sound is influenced by country music , blues , Southern rock , and heavy metal , and has been described as " guitar @-@ heavy , rambunctious music . " Lead singer Doug Phelps ' voice has been described as " alternately suggest [ ing ] Count Basie 's storied blues shouter Jimmy Rushing and the laid @-@ back cool of Eagle Glenn Frey . " The band 's combination of styles is most notable in its cover song choices on early albums . All three Mercury albums contain a Bill Monroe cover , and other covers on these albums include Waylon Jennings , Carl Perkins , Norman Greenbaum and The Lovin ' Spoonful . Soul showcased the band 's blues and R & B influences through its use of Hammond organ and a horn section . The band 's original compositions , such as " Dumas Walker " and the title track to Songs from the Grass String Ranch , often develop a regional theme . 
 At its peak in the early 1990s , The Kentucky Headhunters were considered a dark horse in country music , due to the significant mainstream attention that the band received despite their rougher sound and the members ' rural Southern image . In 1991 , Entertainment Weekly critic Alanna Nash wrote that although the band did not sell as many albums as contemporaries George Strait or Garth Brooks , " they may just end up redefining country for the ' 90s " given the diverse range of influences and styles . Billboard critic Ray Waddell called the band " arguably the most consistent and durable Southern rock outfit on the planet . "

 = Heck horse = 
 The Heck horse is a horse breed that is claimed to resemble the tarpan ( Equus ferus ferus ) , an extinct wild equine . The breed was created by the German zoologist brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck in an attempt to breed back the tarpan . Although unsuccessful at creating a genetic copy of the extinct species , they developed a breed with grullo coloration and primitive markings . After the Nazi invasion of Poland , they were introduced to the Białowieża Forest , where a small herd still survives . Heck horses were subsequently exported to the United States , where a breed association was created in the 1960s . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 Heck horses are dun or grullo ( a dun variant ) in color , with no white markings . The breed has primitive markings , including a dorsal stripe and horizontal striping on the legs . Heck horses generally stand between 12 @.@ 2 and 13 @.@ 2 hands ( 50 and 54 inches , 127 and 137 cm ) tall . The head is large , the withers low , and the legs and hindquarters strong . The hooves are strong , often not needing shoeing . The gait of the Heck horse is high stepping , which makes them comfortable to ride and which is considered attractive while being driven . The breed is described as being calm , friendly , curious and intelligent , although very independent . The physical description of tarpans was very similar - strong , approximately the same height , and with the same coloration and primitive markings . 
 = = History = = 
 The tarpan was a Eurasian wild horse that became extinct in the wild in 1879 , due to hunting and crossbreeding with domesticated horses , and in 1887 the last captive horse died in Russia . The Heck horse was created by the German zoologist brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck , director of the Berlin Zoo , at the Tierpark Hellabrunn ( Munich Zoo ) in Germany in their attempt to breed back the tarpan . The Hecks believed they could recreate the extinct tarpan subspecies by back breeding living descendants . They believed they could combine and rearrange the genetic material from these living descendants into a recreation of the extinct horse . Other breeders had the same idea , and used different genetic stock to attempt to recreate the tarpan or a reasonable look @-@ alike . One result was a line of horses bred from American Mustangs by a breeder named Harry <unk> . 
 The Heck brothers bred together several European small horse and pony breeds hypothesized to be descended from the tarpan . They eventually integrated mares of the Konik , Icelandic horse , and Gotland breeds . These mares were bred to stallions of a wild horse type known as Przewalski 's horse . The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares . The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares ( who visually closely resembled the tarpan , especially in the shape of the head ) and Przewalski 's horse stallions ( who provided the desired dun coloration and upright mane ) , and the offspring were then bred to each other . The first foal born from the program who had the desired coloration was a colt born on May 22 , 1933 at the Tierpark Hellabrunn . The breeding program continued , using only those horses who showed the desired skull shape , bone structure and coloration . Relatively quickly , the breed 's conformation and coloration became set , with parents reliably passing their characteristics onto their offspring . 
 During World War II , horses of the desired type were taken from German @-@ occupied countries to use in the Hecks ' breeding program . Tadeusz <unk> , a Polish biologist , had been working with Konik horses , at that point believed to be descended from tarpans , with the goal ( like the Hecks ) of recreating the tarpan . Some of the horses from his program had been reintroduced to the forests of <unk> , Poland . During the war , the Hecks removed the animals from the forest and used them in their own breeding programs . <unk> considered this a " baffling campaign of destruction " , and the Hecks ' actions effectively ended his breeding program . Some of the resulting Heck horses , closely resembling tarpans , were sent back to <unk> , to become part of a hunting preserve for Nazi government officials . The land , and the horses , were returned to Polish management after the war ended . As of 2007 , a small herd of the horses remained , living with little interference from humans , in Białowieża Forest , Europe 's last remaining area of primeval lowland forest . The Hecks had conducted a similar breeding program in hopes of recreating the aurochs , resulting in what would become Heck cattle . 
 = = = Export and crossbreeding = = = 
 The first Heck horse in the United States was a stallion named Duke , imported in 1954 by the Chicago Zoological Park in Illinois , followed by two mares in 1955 . A third mare was imported by the Fort Worth Zoological Park in Texas in 1962 . All four horses came from the Munich Zoo and in the early 1990s , all Heck horses in the United States traced back to these animals . Several private breeders in the United States now use these horses for riding and light driving . In the early 1960s , the North American Tarpan Association was founded by Heck horse enthusiasts to promote the breed . In 2002 , fewer than 100 Heck horses in the United States , most of them having descended from the six foundation horses , all imported from Germany . As of 2013 , a small number of Heck horses lived in a feral state in Latvia . 
 Several breeders have crossed the Heck horse with other breeds to get a larger horse with some of the primitive characteristics . Breeds commonly crossed with the Heck horse are the Welsh pony and Arabian horse , and a new breed of pony , called the Canadian Rustic Pony , has been developed from these three breeds . In Europe , many breeders cross Heck horses with Thoroughbreds to produce hunters . 
 = Biology = 
 Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms , including their structure , function , growth , evolution , distribution , identification and taxonomy . Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field , composed of many branches and subdisciplines . However , despite the broad scope of biology , there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research , consolidating it into single , coherent field . In general , biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life , genes as the basic unit of heredity , and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species . It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis . 
 Sub @-@ disciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which organisms are studied , the kinds of organisms studied , and the methods used to study them : biochemistry examines the rudimentary chemistry of life ; molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules ; botany studies the biology of plants ; cellular biology examines the basic building @-@ block of all life , the cell ; physiology examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues , organs , and organ systems of an organism ; evolutionary biology examines the processes that produced the diversity of life ; and ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment . 
 = = History = = 
 The term biology is derived from the Greek word <unk> , bios , " life " and the suffix -λογία , <unk> , " study of . " The Latin @-@ language form of the term first appeared in 1736 when Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus ( Carl von Linné ) used <unk> in his Bibliotheca <unk> . It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae : <unk> III , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> generalis , by Michael Christoph <unk> , a disciple of Christian Wolff . The first German use , Biologie , was in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus ' work . In 1797 , Theodor Georg August Roose used the term in the preface of a book , Grundzüge der Lehre van der <unk> . Karl Friedrich Burdach used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological , physiological and psychological perspective ( <unk> zum Studien der <unk> <unk> ) . The term came into its modern usage with the six @-@ volume treatise Biologie , oder Philosophie der <unk> Natur ( 1802 – 22 ) by Gottfried Reinhold <unk> , who announced : 
 The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life , the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur , and the causes through which they have been effected . The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [ Biologie ] or the doctrine of life [ <unk> ] . 
 Although modern biology is a relatively recent development , sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times . Natural philosophy was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia , Egypt , the Indian subcontinent , and China . However , the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece . While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates ( ca . 460 BC – ca . 370 BC ) , it was Aristotle ( 384 BC – 322 BC ) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology . Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings , and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life . Aristotle 's successor at the Lyceum , Theophrastus , wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences , even into the Middle Ages . 
 Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al @-@ Jahiz ( 781 – 869 ) , Al @-@ Dīnawarī ( 828 – 896 ) , who wrote on botany , and Rhazes ( 865 – 925 ) who wrote on anatomy and physiology . Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions , while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought , especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life . 
 Biology began to quickly develop and grow with Anton van Leeuwenhoek 's dramatic improvement of the microscope . It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa , bacteria , infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life . Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining . 
 Advances in microscopy also had a profound impact on biological thinking . In the early 19th century , a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell . Then , in 1838 , Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that ( 1 ) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and ( 2 ) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life , although they opposed the idea that ( 3 ) all cells come from the division of other cells . Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow , however , by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory . 
 Meanwhile , taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians . Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 ( variations of which have been in use ever since ) , and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species . Georges @-@ Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon , treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable — even suggesting the possibility of common descent . Though he was opposed to evolution , Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought ; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin . 
 Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck , who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution . He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals , meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used , the more complex and efficient it would become , thus adapting the animal to its environment . Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal 's offspring , who would further develop and perfect them . However , it was the British naturalist Charles Darwin , combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt , the uniformitarian geology of Lyell , Malthus 's writings on population growth , and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations , who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection ; similar reasoning and evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions . Although it was the subject of controversy ( which continues to this day ) , Darwin 's theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology . 
 The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics . In the 1940s and early 1950s , experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait @-@ carrying units that had become known as genes . A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria , along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953 , marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics . From the 1950s to present times , biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain . The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana , Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons . Finally , the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome . This project was essentially completed in 2003 , with further analysis still being published . The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional , molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms . 
 = = Foundations of modern biology = = 
 = = = Cell theory = = = 
 Cell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life , and that all living things are composed of one or more cells or the secreted products of those cells ( e.g. shells , hairs and nails etc . ) . All cells arise from other cells through cell division . In multicellular organisms , every cell in the organism 's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg . The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes . In addition , the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as metabolism . Finally , cells contain hereditary information ( DNA ) , which is passed from cell to cell during cell division . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution , and that all life @-@ forms known have a common origin . The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth , both living and extinct , have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool . This last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about 3 @.@ 5 billion years ago . Biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria , archaea , and eukaryotes ( see : origin of life ) . 
 Introduced into the scientific lexicon by Jean @-@ Baptiste de Lamarck in 1809 , evolution was established by Charles Darwin fifty years later as a viable scientific model when he articulated its driving force : natural selection . ( Alfred Russel Wallace is recognized as the co @-@ discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution . ) Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth . 
 Darwin theorized that species and breeds developed through the processes of natural selection and artificial selection or selective breeding . Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the modern synthesis of the theory . 
 The evolutionary history of the species — which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended — together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its phylogeny . Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny . These include the comparisons of DNA sequences conducted within molecular biology or genomics , and comparisons of fossils or other records of ancient organisms in paleontology . Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods , including phylogenetics , <unk> , and cladistics . ( For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists , see evolutionary timeline . ) 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Genes are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms . A gene is a unit of heredity and corresponds to a region of DNA that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways . All organisms , from bacteria to animals , share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into proteins . Cells transcribe a DNA gene into an RNA version of the gene , and a ribosome then translates the RNA into a protein , a sequence of amino acids . The translation code from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms , but slightly different for some . For example , a sequence of DNA that codes for insulin in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms , such as plants . 
 DNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes , and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes . A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of DNA and histones . The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria , chloroplasts , or other locations is collectively known as its genome . In eukaryotes , genomic DNA is located in the cell nucleus , along with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts . In prokaryotes , the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid . The genetic information in a genome is held within genes , and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype . 
 = = = Homeostasis = = = 
 Homeostasis is the ability of an open system to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms . All living organisms , whether unicellular or multicellular , exhibit homeostasis . 
 To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions , a system must detect and respond to perturbations . After the detection of a perturbation , a biological system normally responds through negative feedback . This means stabilizing conditions by either reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system . One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low . 
 = = = Energy = = = 
 The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of energy . Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them . In this process , molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles ; first , they contain energy that can be transformed for biological chemical reactions ; second , they develop new molecular structures made up of biomolecules . 
 The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or autotrophs . Nearly all of these organisms originally draw energy from the sun . Plants and other phototrophs use solar energy via a process known as photosynthesis to convert raw materials into organic molecules , such as ATP , whose bonds can be broken to release energy . A few ecosystems , however , depend entirely on energy extracted by <unk> from methane , sulfides , or other non @-@ <unk> energy sources . 
 Some of the captured energy is used to produce biomass to sustain life and provide energy for growth and development . The majority of the rest of this energy is lost as heat and waste molecules . The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration . 
 = = Study and research = = 
 = = = Structural = = = 
 Molecular biology is the study of biology at a molecular level . This field overlaps with other areas of biology , particularly with genetics and biochemistry . Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell , including the interrelationship of DNA , RNA , and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated . 
 Cell biology studies the structural and physiological properties of cells , including their behaviors , interactions , and environment . This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels , for unicellular organisms such as bacteria , as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as humans . Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences . The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology . 
 Anatomy considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as organs and organ systems . 
 Genetics is the science of genes , heredity , and the variation of organisms . Genes encode the information necessary for synthesizing proteins , which in turn play a central role in influencing the final phenotype of the organism . In modern research , genetics provides important tools in the investigation of the function of a particular gene , or the analysis of genetic interactions . Within organisms , genetic information generally is carried in chromosomes , where it is represented in the chemical structure of particular DNA molecules . 
 Developmental biology studies the process by which organisms grow and develop . Originating in embryology , modern developmental biology studies the genetic control of cell growth , differentiation , and " morphogenesis , " which is the process that progressively gives rise to tissues , organs , and anatomy . Model organisms for developmental biology include the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans , the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , the zebrafish Danio rerio , the mouse Mus musculus , and the weed Arabidopsis thaliana . ( A model organism is a species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena , with the expectation that discoveries made in that organism provide insight into the workings of other organisms . ) 
 = = = Physiological = = = 
 Physiology studies the mechanical , physical , and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole . The theme of " structure to function " is central to biology . Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology , but some principles of physiology are universal , no matter what particular organism is being studied . For example , what is learned about the physiology of yeast cells can also apply to human cells . The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human physiology to non @-@ human species . Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields . 
 Physiology studies how for example nervous , immune , endocrine , respiratory , and circulatory systems , function and interact . The study of these systems is shared with medically oriented disciplines such as neurology and immunology . 
 = = = Evolutionary = = = 
 Evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of species , as well as their change over time , and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines . For example , it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy , ornithology , botany , or herpetology , but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution . 
 Evolutionary biology is partly based on paleontology , which uses the fossil record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution , and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics . In the 1980s , developmental biology re @-@ entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology . Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are phylogenetics , systematics , and taxonomy . 
 = = = Systematic = = = 
 Multiple speciation events create a tree structured system of relationships between species . The role of systematics is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species . However , systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common . 
 Traditionally , living things have been divided into five kingdoms : <unk> ; <unk> ; Fungi ; Plantae ; Animalia . However , many scientists now consider this five @-@ kingdom system outdated . Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three @-@ domain system : Archaea ( originally Archaebacteria ) ; Bacteria ( originally Eubacteria ) and Eukaryota ( including protists , fungi , plants , and animals ) These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not , as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as ribosomes . 
 Further , each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified . The order is : Domain ; Kingdom ; Phylum ; Class ; Order ; Family ; Genus ; Species . 
 Outside of these categories , there are obligate intracellular parasites that are " on the edge of life " in terms of metabolic activity , meaning that many scientists do not actually classify these structures as alive , due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions or characteristics that define life . They are classified as viruses , viroids , prions , or satellites . 
 The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species . For example , humans are listed as Homo sapiens . Homo is the genus , and sapiens the species . When writing the scientific name of an organism , it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase . Additionally , the entire term may be italicized or underlined . 
 The dominant classification system is called the Linnaean taxonomy . It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature . How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICN ) , the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) , and the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria ( <unk> ) . The classification of viruses , viroids , prions , and all other sub @-@ viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) and is known as the International Code of Viral Classification and Nomenclature ( <unk> ) . However , several other viral classification systems do exist . 
 A merging draft , BioCode , was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas , but has yet to be formally adopted . The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997 ; its originally planned implementation date of January 1 , 2000 , has passed unnoticed . A revised BioCode that , instead of replacing the existing codes , would provide a unified context for them , was proposed in 2011 . However , the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal . The <unk> remains outside the BioCode , which does not include viral classification . 
 = = = Kingdoms = = = 
 = = = Ecological and environmental = = = 
 Ecology studies the distribution and abundance of living organisms , and the interactions between organisms and their environment . The habitat of an organism can be described as the local abiotic factors such as climate and ecology , in addition to the other organisms and biotic factors that share its environment . One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible , even on small scales . A microscopic bacterium in a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna . For any species , behaviors can be co @-@ operative , competitive , parasitic , or symbiotic . Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem . 
 Ecological systems are studied at several different levels , from individuals and populations to ecosystems and the biosphere . The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology , although population biology is more frequently used when studying diseases , viruses , and microbes , while population ecology is more commonly used when studying plants and animals . Ecology draws on many subdisciplines . 
 Ethology studies animal behavior ( particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids ) , and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology . Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection . In one sense , the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin , whose book , The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , influenced many ethologists to come . 
 Biogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the Earth , focusing on topics like plate tectonics , climate change , dispersal and migration , and cladistics . 
 = = Basic unresolved problems in biology = = 
 Despite the profound advances made over recent decades in our understanding of life 's fundamental processes , some basic problems have remained unresolved . For example , one of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex , and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes , meiosis and homologous recombination . One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation for increasing genetic diversity ( see references e.g. ) . An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ @-@ line DNA , and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run . ( See also Evolution of sexual reproduction ) . 
 Another basic unresolved problem in biology is the biologic basis of aging . At present , there is no consensus view on the underlying cause of aging . Various competing theories are outlined in Ageing Theories .

 = Inside Man = 
 Inside Man is a 2006 American crime thriller film directed by Spike Lee , written by Russell Gewirtz . The film centers on an elaborate bank heist on Wall Street over a 24 @-@ hour period . It stars Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier , the NYPD 's hostage negotiator ; Clive Owen as Dalton Russell , the mastermind who orchestrates the heist , and Jodie Foster as Madeleine White , a Manhattan power broker who becomes involved at the request of the bank 's founder , Arthur Case ( Christopher Plummer ) , to keep something in his own personal safe deposit box protected from the robbers . Inside Man marks the fourth ( and currently last ) film collaboration between Washington and Lee . 
 Gewirtz spent five years developing the film 's premise before working on his first original screenplay . After he completed the script in 2002 , Imagine Entertainment purchased it to be made by Universal Studios , with Imagine co @-@ founder Ron Howard attached to direct . After Howard stepped down , his Imagine partner Brian Grazer began looking for a new director to helm the project . Grazer hired Lee to do so . Principal photography for Inside Man began in June 2005 and concluded in August of that year ; filming took place on location in New York City . The film premiered in New York on March 20 , 2006 before being released in North America on March 24 , 2006 . Upon release , Inside Man received a generally positive critical response and was a commercial success , grossing over $ 184 million worldwide . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Dalton Russell ( Clive Owen ) , seated in what appears to be a jail cell , opens the film with a prologue about having carried out the " perfect robbery " . A team of masked robbers , dressed as painters who call each other by variants of the name " Steve " , seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the employees and patrons hostage . They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms . Additionally , they take all of the hostages ' clothes and dress everyone in jumpsuits and masks identical to those of the robbers . This way , the robbers and hostages will be indistinguishable to the police . Police surround the bank and detectives Keith Frazier ( Denzel Washington ) and Bill Mitchell ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) take charge of the negotiations . Russell , the leader of the robbers , demands food . The police supply pizzas whose boxes include listening devices ; these pick up a language which the police finally identify as Albanian . However , they discover that the conversations are just old propaganda recordings of the deceased Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha ; it becomes clear that the robbers anticipated surveillance . 
 After being informed of the robbery , Arthur Case ( Christopher Plummer ) , the chairman of the board of directors and founder of the bank , hires " fixer " Madeleine White ( Jodie Foster ) to try to protect the contents of his safe deposit box within the bank . White , with assistance from the Mayor of New York City , arranges a conversation with Russell , who allows her to enter the bank and inspect the contents of the box , which include documents from Nazi Germany . Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services , resulting in the deaths of many Jewish people during World War II . White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum to destroy the contents of the box . She claims she can arrange a minimal jail sentence as Russell and his team have not yet stolen anything or hurt or killed anyone ; Russell declines her offers . 
 Frazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell takes him on a tour of the bank . As he is being shown out , Frazier attacks Russell , but is restrained by another robber . Alone with Russell shortly afterward , the other robber , who turns out to be one of the hostages " interviewed " by Frazier , begins to panic and ask what would have happened had Frazier managed to remove Russell 's mask . Russell appears lost in thought . Frazier later explains to Mitchell that his actions were intended to provoke Russell to establish whether he was capable of killing and concludes he is not . The robbers counter this theory by shooting a hostage in the head . 
 The execution prompts the ESU team into action . They plan to storm the bank and use rubber bullets to knock out the occupants . However , Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police ; aware of the police plans , the robbers detonate smoke grenades and release all the hostages . The police detain everyone , knowing that some of the hostages are members of the gang , but can 't distinguish between the two . They interrogate the hostages harshly , questioning their honesty and trying to glean useful information , to no avail . A search of the bank reveals that the robbers ' weapons are plastic replicas . They find props for faking the hostage 's execution ; the blood was red paint . Curiously , no money or valuables appear to have been taken . 
 With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has been committed , Frazier 's superior , on orders from the mayor , tells him to drop the case , but Frazier continues . He searches the bank 's records and finds that one of the safe deposit boxes does not appear on the records and obtains a search warrant to open it . He is confronted by White , who informs him of Case 's Nazi dealings . She tries to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation , but he refuses , playing a recorded , incriminating conversation that she earlier had with him . White confronts Case , who admits to his actions and reveals that the box contained , aside from incriminating paperwork , diamonds and a ring which had belonged to a French Jewish banker and his family who were sent to concentration camps . White is repulsed by Case but accepts his payment for her mission , although it was one of her few failures . She tells him that the robber took the incriminating paperwork so that , if he returns with a blackmail demand , Case will have to pay him off . 
 Russell reappears in the same location in which he gave his opening monologue . He is revealed to have been hiding in a small room behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the bank 's supply room . The construction of the hiding area was the real reason for their delaying tactics . Russell emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case 's safe deposit box , including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds . On his way out , he bumps into Frazier , who does not recognize him . Russell goes to a car where his four associates are waiting , and they drive off . 
 When Frazier opens the safe deposit box , he finds a large ring with a note from Russell telling him to " follow the ring " . Frazier confronts Case and next goes to see White , who is in a restaurant with some VIPs , including the mayor . Frazier gives her the contact information for the Office of War Crimes Issues at the U.S. State Department . On returning home to his girlfriend , Frazier finds a loose , small but valuable diamond in his pocket . He realizes it must have been slipped to him by Russell in the bank after he intentionally bumped into Frazier .

 Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier : 
 A New York City police detective with a scandal attached to his name who is desperate to make Detective First Grade . He is assigned to negotiate with the ringleader of a Manhattan bank heist . Inside Man marks Washington 's fourth collaboration with director Spike Lee . After being approached by Lee to star in the film , he was given the opportunity to play Frazier or Dalton Russell , but turned down the latter , citing concerns over the character 's disguise . Washington cited his Broadway performance as Brutus in Julius Caesar as inspiration : " I think it actually helped me prepare for Frazier — Russell [ Gewirtz ] ’ s script is heavy with great dialogue . My character does a lot of talking ! I kind of thought of Frazier as Brutus goes to Brooklyn . For me , there is a certain rhythm and cadence of New Yorkers , and this gave me the opportunity to play a New York kind of guy who ’ s going through a lot while dealing with this smart and challenging adversary . " 
 Clive Owen as Dalton Russell : 
 The ringleader of the elaborate bank heist . Russell first appears at the beginning of the film , breaking the fourth wall and narrating in medias res of how he will commit the perfect bank robbery . Owen nearly turned down the role ; like Washington , he expressed concerns over the character ’ s disguise of a hood , mask and sunglasses : " To play whole scenes where you ’ re masked , you 've got on sunglasses and you ’ re wearing a hood is very weird , because a lot of acting is often through intent , and intent is shown through the eyes . To suddenly have that taken away and have this big barrier there was very disarming . " Owen , however , accepted the role after further discussing the part with Lee . The script was also revised to include scenes in which Owen 's face could be shown . 
 Jodie Foster as Madeleine White : 
 A Manhattan power broker who is hired to act as a " fixer " in response to the bank heist . Foster saw Inside Man as an opportunity to collaborate with Lee : " Spike is somebody who always fascinated me , and I 've loved his movies . I 've always wanted to be involved in something he 's making . Basically , I never thought I would because it didn 't seem like his stories or subject matter were ever going to include me . So , I 'm just as excited as I can be . " She described her character as a woman with " a relaxed kind of witty quality to her . All the while being very strong , not having to raise her voice very much , not having to yell at anybody — she 's got authority . There 's seductiveness , a charm , if you will , to her ability to get into people 's psyches that 's been immensely fun to play . It all went way too fast for me . " 
 Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case : 
 The chairman of the board of directors and founder of the fictional Manhattan Trust bank . In response to the bank heist , Case hires White to prevent a possible career @-@ ending situation . Inside Man is Plummer 's second collaboration with Lee and Washington , following 1992 's Malcolm X. He described Case as a " wonderful , rich head of all sorts of organizations — I suppose a kind of ' Enron creature ' — who runs banks and other world businesses . He has tentacles everywhere , and he 's a real son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch who 's trying to keep a secret in the process . " 
 Willem Dafoe as Captain John Darius : 
 A veteran captain of the NYPD Emergency Services Unit . Dafoe saw the film as opportunity to work in New York City and collaborate with Lee . He felt that the film was " about the city ; it ’ s about authority ; it ’ s about the mentality of crime ; and it ’ s about power … and payback . " 
 Chiwetel Ejiofor as Detective Bill Mitchell : 
 A New York City police detective and Frazier 's partner . Inside Man is Ejiofor 's second film with Lee , after She Hate Me ( 2004 ) . He first learned of the film after meeting with Lee : " He said he wanted me to read the script and see if I wanted to be involved . Spike asks so many people to come back and work with him in different capacities and as different types of characters . " 
 Appearing as Russell 's accomplices are : 
 Carlos Andrés Gómez as Steve ( as Kenneth <unk> ) 
 Kim Director as Stevie ( Valerie Keepsake ) 
 James <unk> as Steve @-@ O ( Darius Peltz ) 
 Bernie Rachelle as Chaim , an older Jewish man who works as a professor at Columbia 's Law School , who teaches courses on genocide , slave labor , and war reparation claims , who is part of the plot but was not one of the " Steves " , given his age and physique . 
 Appearing as some of the more notable hostages are Ken Leung as Wing , who was distracted in the bank before the heist by the <unk> woman ( played by Samantha Ivers ) standing behind him and talking loudly on her phone ; Gerry <unk> as Howard Kurtz , an elderly hostage suffering chest pains who is quickly released by the robbers ; Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia , a Sikh bank clerk whose turban is removed by the cops , which is a religious sacrilege for a Sikh male ; Peter <unk> as Peter Hammond , a bank employee whose attempt to hide his cell phone from Russell results in his getting beat ; Amir Ali Said as Brian Robinson , an 8 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who speaks with both Russell and Frazier and who plays a killing computer game ; Ed <unk> Blunt as Ray Robinson , Brian 's father ; and Marcia Jean Kurtz , who plays an older woman who initially refuses to strip and is forced to do so by Stevie . Kurtz 's character is named Miriam Douglas ; Kurtz played a hostage named Miriam in Dog Day Afternoon , a bank robbery film , which unlike Inside Man , contained significant violence . Lionel Pina , who also appeared in Dog Day Afternoon as a pizza delivery man , appears in Inside Man as a policeman who delivers pizzas at the bank 's front doors . 
 Other roles include Cassandra Freeman as Sylvia , Frazier 's girlfriend ; Peter Gerety as Captain Coughlin , Frazier and Mitchell 's superior ; Victor Colicchio as Sergeant Collins , the first officer to respond to the bank robbery ; Jason Manuel <unk> as ESU Officer Hernandez ; Al <unk> as Kevin , a sanitation worker who recognizes the language as Albanian , as he was formerly married to an Albanian @-@ born woman ; Florina <unk> as <unk> , the Albanian woman in question who explains that they are hearing recordings of an Albanian president ; Peter <unk> as the Mayor of New York City ; Anthony Mangano as an ESU officer ; and Daryl Mitchell and <unk> Atkinson as Mobile Command Officers .

 Inside Man was Russell Gewirtz 's debut film as a screenwriter . A former lawyer , Gewirtz conceived the idea while vacationing in several countries . He worked for five years to develop the film 's premise . Inexperienced at screenwriting , Gewirtz studied a number of screenplays before working on his own , which he titled " The Inside Man " . His friend , Daniel M. Rosenberg , assisted in developing the script . After it was completed in 2002 , the screenplay was passed around several times . Rosenberg shopped the script to a number of Los Angeles agencies , until Universal Studios executives Scott Stuber and Donna Langley persuaded Gewirtz to take the script to Universal and Imagine Entertainment . Imagine purchased Gewirtz 's screenplay in 2002 , and the project began development at Universal , who retitled the film Inside Man . 
 Imagine co @-@ founder Ron Howard was attached to direct the film , but turned it down after being asked by Russell Crowe to helm Cinderella Man ( 2004 ) . Howard 's Imagine partner Brian Grazer began looking for a new director . After Howard stepped down , Menno Meyjes contributed to Gewirtz 's screenplay , and Terry George incorporated the Nazi Germany and diamond ring elements to the script . Meyjes was in negotiations to direct the film , but after he declined , Grazer thought this project was a chance to work with Spike Lee , who had already learned of Gewirtz 's script . Lee said of the screenplay , " I liked the script and really wanted to do it . ' Dog Day Afternoon , ' directed by Sidney Lumet , is one of my favorite films , and this story was a contemporary take on that kind of a movie . " 
 After being cast , Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor worked together on studying their lines and understanding their characters . Lee helped prepare his actors by screening a number of heist films including Dog Day Afternoon ( 1975 ) and Serpico ( 1973 ) . Washington , Ejiofor , Willem Dafoe and other actors met and worked with members of the New York City Police Department , who shared their experiences and stories involving civilians and hostage situations .

 Principal photography for Inside Man took place on location in New York City ; filming began in June 2005 and concluded in August after 43 days . Universal Pictures provided a budget of $ 45 million . By filming in New York , the production was eligible for the city 's " Made in NY " incentives program . Interior sets were created at the New York @-@ based Steiner Studios , and Inside Man was the second film ( after 2005 's The Producers ) to be shot inside the 15 @-@ acre facility . 
 Location scouting revealed a former Wall Street bank that had been closed down and repurposed as a cigar bar . The building stood in for the fictional Manhattan Trust Bank branch , where the bank heist occurs . " Without a bank , we didn ’ t have a movie , " Lee explained . " But everything ended up going very smoothly . We shot in the heart of Wall Street in a bank that had been closed down . It was like having a back lot in the middle of Wall Street . " An office at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House doubled as the office of Arthur Case ( Christopher Plummer ) . Plummer believed that the office 's design was essential to his character : " The space literally presents Case ’ s power , so I found that part of my character was to simply play very cool about everything . You don ’ t have to push the power , because it ’ s all around you . " The location was also used to film a scene where Frazier confronts Madeleine White ( Jodie Foster ) . The American Tract Society building , located at 150 Nassau Street and Spruce Street , Manhattan , doubled as White 's office . Cafe Bravo , a coffee shop located at 76 Beaver Street and Hanover Street , was also used for filming . Other filming locations included Battery Park and the New York Supreme Court House 's Appellate Division located at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue , Manhattan .

 Wynn Thomas supervised the production design , continuing a 20 @-@ year collaboration with Lee . With a former Wall Street bank doubling as the fictional Manhattan Trust branch , Thomas and his team restored the former bank to its 1920s architectural structure . The first floor underwent renovations and was used as the first place where the hostages are held captive by the robbers . The bank 's basement was one of several interior sets created at Steiner Studios . Thomas and his team also designed Frazier 's apartment , which he described as " very masculine and rich and highly monochromatic in its many hues of brown . " He was also tasked with designing a police interrogation room , as well as the interiors of the New York City Police Department and a light @-@ duty Mobile Command vehicle . An actual Mobile Command vehicle , supplied by LDV Group , was used for exteriors .

 Inside Man was director of photography Matthew Libatique 's second film with Lee . Because the filmmakers intended to finish with a digital intermediate ( the post @-@ production digital manipulation of color and lighting ) , Libatique chose to shoot Inside Man in the Super 35 format for a 2 @.@ 35 : 1 aspect ratio . He mainly used Kodak Vision2 500T <unk> and Vision2 Expression 500T <unk> film stocks . The film was shot with Arricam and Arriflex cameras and Cooke S4 lenses . 
 Several scenes in Inside Man required multiple @-@ camera setups , which meant that Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators . Lee wanted to create a visual distinction between the characters Russell ( Owen ) and Frazier ( Washington ) , while incorporating visual metaphors . Russell 's scenes , in which he masterminds the bank heist , were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control . Frazier 's scenes , in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation , were filmed with multiple hand @-@ held cameras to display the character 's confusion . Libatique explained , " I said , ' We want to create a sense of control and largely centered frames with Clive ’ s character , and we want to have movement with Denzel ’ s . ' Having three operators on the same character , I ’ d watch all three . In a handheld shot , a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother . I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady . It was the first time I ’ d worked with so many operators where I wasn ’ t one myself . " Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios . Steadicam operator Stephen <unk> estimated that 80 % of the film was shot with hand @-@ held cameras or a Steadicam . A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released . A <unk> was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment , in which the hostages are placed in buses . 
 The film features a number of scenes which involve Detectives Frazier and Mitchell ( <unk> Ejiofor ) interrogating several hostages during the aftermath of the heist . Libatique described these scenes as a " flash @-@ forward " to events , explaining that Lee " wanted a look that would jump out and tell you you ’ re somewhere else . " Libatique photographed the scenes with Kodak Ektachrome 100D <unk> reversal film . Technicolor then cross @-@ processed the filmed footage before it was put through a bleach bypass , which neutralized color temperature and created more contrast . Libatique explained , " Basically , it unifies all the color ... When you try to apply correction , the film moves in very strange ways . " 
 Post @-@ production facility EFILM carried out the digital intermediate ( DI ) , with Libatique overseeing the process and working with colorists Steve Bowen and Steve Scott : " It ’ s difficult to match all of your shots meticulously when you have three cameras and one lighting setup , so I spent the majority of the DI just adhering to the original vision of the disparity in color temperature , which I can accentuate , versus the unified color temperature . " A majority of Inside Man was scanned on a <unk> film scanner , while the interrogation scenes had to be scanned on a Spirit <unk> , as the negatives proved " too dense for the <unk> to perform the task . "

 Inside Man features a scene in which Russell ( Owen ) interacts with Brian Robinson ( Amir Ali Said ) , an 8 @-@ year @-@ old boy who is playing a violent video game titled " Gangstas iz Genocide " on his PlayStation Portable . The scene is intercut with a 30 @-@ second animated sequence of the fictional game , in which a character performs a drive @-@ by shooting , before killing an intended target with a hand grenade . Using the Grand Theft Auto franchise as a reference , Lee wanted the scene to serve as a social commentary on gangsta rap , violent crime among African Americans and the rising level of killings in video games . 
 Cinematographer Matthew Libatique enlisted his cousin , Eric Alba , and a team of graphic artists known as House of Pain to design the 30 @-@ second animated sequence . Lee asked for the sequence to show two black characters in a ghetto environment dressed in gangster attire . He also gave the artists mockups of two scenarios that ended in homicide — one being a robbery at an ATM , and the other a drive @-@ by shooting . 
 House of Pain spent 10 days working on " Gangstas iz Genocide " . Alba digitally photographed images of buildings near the Marcy Houses in Brooklyn , New York . Portions of the sequence were pre @-@ visualized in 3D Studio Max , while stills were imported as texture maps and added to animated cut scenes created in 3D modeling package Maya . The artists also improvised the use of a hand grenade . When Lee saw how violent the sequence was , he improvised the line " Kill Dat Nigga ! " as a subtitle . The entire sequence was rendered out to play onscreen in full frame . The original running time of the animated sequence was 60 seconds . Lee cut it to 30 seconds , feeling that a shorter length would make more of an impact . Upon Inside Man 's theatrical release , he regretted the video game sequence in the film , saying , " The sad thing is somebody is probably gonna make a game out of it and take that as inspiration . "

 Jazz musician and trumpeter Terence Blanchard composed the film score , marking his eleventh collaboration with Lee . The soundtrack for Inside Man features the song " Chaiyya Chaiyya " , composed by A. R. Rahman , which originally appeared in the 1998 Hindi film Dil Se .. The song is featured during the opening credits of the film . A remix of the song , titled " Chaiyya , Chaiyya Bollywood Joint " plays during the end credits , and features Panjabi MC 's added rap lyrics about people of different backgrounds coming together in order to survive . The soundtrack , titled Inside Man : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack , was released on CD in North America on March 21 , 2006 , through record label Varèse Sarabande .

" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote , " The basic story is elemental , but because Lee and Gewirtz invest it with grit , comedy , and a ton of New York ethnic personality , it 's fresh anyway . " David Ansen of Newsweek commented , " As unexpected as some of its plot twists is the fact that this unapologetic genre movie was directed by Spike Lee , who has never sold himself as Mr. Entertainment . But here it is , a Spike Lee joint that 's downright fun . " Giving the film a B + rating , Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote , " Inside Man is a hybrid of studio action pic and Spike Lee joint . Or else it 's a cross between a 2006 Spike Lee joint and a 1970s @-@ style movie indictment of urban unease . " 
 Not all reviewers gave Inside Man positive reviews . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave it a mixed review , writing , " Here is a thriller that 's curiously reluctant to get to the payoff , and when it does , we see why : We can 't accept the motive and method of the bank robbery , we can 't believe in one character and can 't understand another . " Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film one star out of five , calling it a " supremely annoying and nonsensical film " . Rex Reed of The New York Observer wrote , " Inside Man has two things going for it : better actors than usual and a slicker look . Otherwise , it ’ s no different from nine out of 10 other preposterous , contrived , confusingly written , unevenly directed , pointless and forgettable junk films we ’ ve been getting these days . "

 In November 2006 , it was announced that a sequel to Inside Man was in development , with Russell Gewirtz reprising screenwriting duties . Under the working title Inside Man 2 , the film would have Brian Grazer again serve as producer . Spike Lee was in negotiations to reprise his directing duties while serving as an executive producer alongside returning member Daniel M. Rosenberg . In 2008 , Terry George was in negotiations to write the screenplay for the sequel ; he later replaced Gewirtz , whose screenplay was abandoned . The plot for the sequel was intended to continue after the events of the first film , with Dalton Russell ( played by Clive Owen ) masterminding another robbery , and again matching wits with NYPD hostage negotiator Keith Frazier ( Denzel Washington ) . Lee confirmed that Washington , Owen , Jodie Foster and Chiwetel Ejiofor would all reprise their roles . He also expressed interest in filming Inside Man 2 during the fall of 2009 . 
 In 2011 , it was announced that plans to make Inside Man 2 had been cancelled . Lee confirmed this , expressing that he could not secure funding for the project . " Inside Man was my most successful film , but we can ’ t get the sequel made , " he said . " And one thing Hollywood does well is sequels . The film ’ s not getting made . We tried many times . It ’ s not going to happen . " 
 = Invasive species = 
 An invasive species is a plant , fungus , or animal species that is not native to a specific location ( an introduced species ) , and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment , human economy or human health . 
 One study pointed out widely divergent perceptions of the criteria for invasive species among researchers ( p . 135 ) and concerns with the subjectivity of the term " invasive " ( p . 136 ) . Some of the alternate usages of the term are below : 
 The term as most often used applies to introduced species ( also called " non @-@ indigenous " or " non @-@ native " ) that adversely affect the habitats and bioregions they invade economically , environmentally , or ecologically . Such invasive species may be either plants or animals and may disrupt by dominating a region , wilderness areas , particular habitats , or wildland @-@ urban interface land from loss of natural controls ( such as predators or herbivores ) . This includes non @-@ native invasive plant species labeled as exotic pest plants and invasive exotics growing in native plant communities . It has been used in this sense by government organizations as well as conservation groups such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) and the California Native Plant Society . The European Union defines " Invasive Alien Species " as those that are , firstly , outside their natural distribution area , and secondly , threaten biological diversity . It is also used by land managers , botanists , researchers , horticulturalists , conservationists , and the public for noxious weeds . The kudzu vine ( Pueraria lobata ) , Andean Pampas grass ( <unk> <unk> ) , and yellow starthistle ( Centaurea solstitialis ) are examples . 
 An alternate usage broadens the term to include indigenous or " native " species along with non @-@ native species , that have colonized natural areas ( p . 136 ) . Deer are an example , considered to be <unk> their native zones and adjacent suburban gardens , by some in the Northeastern and Pacific Coast regions of the United States . 
 Sometimes the term is used to describe a non @-@ native or introduced species that has become widespread ( p . 136 ) . However , not every introduced species has adverse effects on the environment . A <unk> example is the common goldfish ( Carassius auratus ) , which is found throughout the United States , but rarely achieves high densities ( p . 136 ) . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Scientists include <unk> and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms that when combined , establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species . 
 = = = Species @-@ based mechanisms = = = 
 While all species compete to survive , invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete native species . In some cases , the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction . In other cases , species interact with each other more directly . 
 Researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers . One study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species , 86 % of the invasive species could be identified from the traits alone . Another study found invasive species tended to have only a small subset of the presumed traits and that many similar traits were found in noninvasive species , requiring other explanations . Common invasive species traits include the following : 
 Fast growth 
 Rapid reproduction 
 High dispersal ability 
 <unk> plasticity ( the ability to alter growth form to suit current conditions ) 
 Tolerance of a wide range of environmental conditions ( Ecological competence ) 
 Ability to live off of a wide range of food types ( generalist ) 
 Association with humans 
 Prior successful invasions 
 Typically , an introduced species must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location . At low population densities , it can be difficult for the introduced species to reproduce and maintain itself in a new location , so a species might reach a location multiple times before it becomes established . Repeated patterns of human movement , such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment ( also known as a high <unk> pressure ) . 
 An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as nutrients , light , physical space , water , or food . If these species evolved under great competition or predation , then the new environment may host fewer able competitors , allowing the invader to proliferate quickly . Ecosystems in which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as zero @-@ sum systems in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native . However , such unilateral competitive superiority ( and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader ) is not the rule . Invasive species often coexist with native species for an extended time , and gradually , the superior competitive ability of an invasive species becomes apparent as its population grows larger and denser and it adapts to its new location . 
 An invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species , such as deep water sources accessed by a long taproot , or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types . For example , barbed <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) was introduced to California on serpentine soils , which have low water @-@ retention , low nutrient levels , a high magnesium / calcium ratio , and possible heavy metal toxicity . Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density , but <unk> can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils . 
 Invasive species might alters its environment by releasing chemical compounds , modifying abiotic factors , or affecting the behaviour of herbivores , creating a positive or negative impact on other species . Some species , like <unk> <unk> , produce allelopathic compounds , that might have an inhibitory effect on competing species . Other species like <unk> gigantea facilitates the recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate <unk> conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages of development . 
 Another examples are Centaurea solstitialis ( yellow starthistle ) and Centaurea diffusa ( diffuse knapweed ) . These Eastern European noxious weeds have spread through the western and West Coast states . Experiments show that 8 @-@ <unk> , a chemical produced at the root of C. diffusa , has a negative effect only on plants that have not co @-@ evolved with it . Such co @-@ evolved native plants have also evolved defenses . C. diffusa and C. solstitialis do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors . Success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others . Conversely , examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness . 
 Changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation . Bromus tectorum , originally from Eurasia , is highly fire @-@ adapted . It not only spreads rapidly after burning but also increases the frequency and intensity ( heat ) of fires by providing large amounts of dry detritus during the fire season in western North America . In areas where it is widespread , it has altered the local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires , allowing B. tectorum to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range . 
 <unk> also occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species . For example , zebra mussels increase habitat complexity on lake floors , providing crevices in which invertebrates live . This increase in complexity , together with the nutrition provided by the waste products of mussel filter @-@ feeding , increases the density and diversity of benthic invertebrate communities . 
 = = = Ecosystem @-@ based mechanisms = = = 
 In ecosystems , the amount of available resources and the extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on the ecosystem . In stable ecosystems , equilibrium exists in the use of available resources . These mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has suffered a disturbance , which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem . 
 When changes such as a forest fire occur , normal succession favors native grasses and forbs . An introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species , squeezing them out . Nitrogen and phosphorus are often the limiting factors in these situations . 
 Every species occupies a niche in its native ecosystem ; some species fill large and varied roles , while others are highly specialized . Some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species , and they also can create new niches . An example of this type can be found within the <unk> <unk> species of skink . 
 Ecosystem changes can alter species ' distributions . For example , edge effects describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture . The boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat , creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat . 
 One interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments . When bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in the population size , the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to <unk> variance . This conversion can actually lead to increased variance in the founding populations which then allows for rapid adaptive evolution . Following invasion events , selection may initially act on the capacity to disperse as well as physiological tolerance to the new stressors in the environment . Adaptation then proceeds to respond to the selective pressures of the new environment . These responses would most likely be due to temperature and climate change , or the presence of native species whether it be predator or prey . Adaptations include changes in morphology , physiology , phenology , and plasticity . 
 Rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher fitness and are better suited for their environment . <unk> phenotypic plasticity , pre @-@ adaptation and post @-@ introduction evolution are all major factors in adaptive evolution . Plasticity in populations allows room for changes to better suit the individual in its environment . This is key in adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the ecosystem that the species has been introduced . The ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness . Pre @-@ adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species . If the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced , it is more likely to fare better in the new environment . This , in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction , all determine if the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Traits of invaded ecosystems = = = 
 In 1958 , Charles S. Elton claimed that ecosystems with higher species diversity were less subject to invasive species because of fewer available niches . Other ecologists later pointed to highly diverse , but heavily invaded ecosystems and argued that ecosystems with high species diversity were more susceptible to invasion . 
 This debate hinged on the spatial scale at which invasion studies were performed , and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011 . Small @-@ scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion , while large @-@ scale studies tended to show the reverse . The latter result may be a side @-@ effect of invasives ' ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered . 
 Invasion was more likely in ecosystems that were similar to the one in which the potential invader evolved . Island ecosystems may be more prone to invasion because their species faced few strong competitors and predators , or because their distance from colonizing species populations makes them more likely to have " open " niches . An example of this phenomenon was the decimation of native bird populations on Guam by the invasive brown tree snake . Conversely , invaded ecosystems may lack the natural competitors and predators that check invasives ' growth in their native ecosystems . 
 Invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance , typically human @-@ induced . Such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem . 
 = = = Vectors = = = 
 Non @-@ native species have many vectors , including biogenic vectors , but most invasions are associated with human activity . Natural range extensions are common in many species , but the rate and magnitude of human @-@ mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions , and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces . 
 An early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the Pacific rat ( Rattus exulans ) to Polynesia . 
 Vectors include plants or seeds imported for horticulture . The pet trade moves animals across borders , where they can escape and become invasive . Organisms stow away on transport vehicles . Ballast water taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non @-@ native aquatic species invasions . Around the world on the average day , more than 3 @,@ 000 different species of aquatic life may be transported on these vessels . For example , freshwater zebra mussels , native to the Black , Caspian and Azov seas , probably reached the Great Lakes via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel . Although the zebra mussel invasion was first noted in 1988 , and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly thereafter , the plan had ( and continued to have as of 2005 ) a serious flaw or loophole , whereby ships that are loaded with cargo when they reach the Seaway need not be tested , but all the same they transfer ballast ' puddles ' between Seaway ports . 
 The arrival of invasive propagules to a new site is a function of the site 's <unk> . 
 Species have also been introduced intentionally . For example , to feel more " at home , " American colonists formed " <unk> Societies " that repeatedly imported birds that were native to Europe to North America and other distant lands . In 2008 , U.S. postal workers in Pennsylvania noticed noises coming from inside a box from Taiwan ; the box contained more than two dozen live beetles . Agricultural Research Service entomologists identified them as rhinoceros beetle , <unk> beetle , and king stag beetle . Because these species were not native to the U.S. , they could have threatened native ecosystems . To prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the U.S. , special handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries . USDA programs such as Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance ( <unk> ) attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in America . 
 Economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction . High demand for the valuable Chinese mitten crab is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waters . 
 = = = Impacts of wildfire = = = 
 Invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem ( wildfires , roads , foot trails ) to colonize an area . Large wildfires can sterilize soils , while adding a variety of nutrients . In the resulting free @-@ for @-@ all , formerly entrenched species lose their advantage , leaving more room for invasives . In such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage . Non @-@ natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation , leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout . 
 = = = = Impact of wildfire suppression on spreading = = = = 
 Wildfires often occur in remote areas , needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site . The crews can bring invasive seeds with them . If any of these stowaway seeds become established , a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks , after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread . Also , disturbing the soil surface , such as cutting firebreaks , destroys native cover , exposes soil , and can accelerate invasions . In suburban and wildland @-@ urban interface areas , the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for defensible space can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species . 
 Fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks , as the vehicles are often driven on back roads often overgrown with invasive plant species . The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport . In response , on large fires , washing stations " decontaminate " vehicles before engaging in suppression activities . Large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places , further increasing the potential for seed transport . 
 = = Effects = = 
 = = = Ecological = = = 
 Land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species . Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems , changing ecosystem functions . A species of wetland plant known as <unk> in Hawaii ( the indigenous <unk> <unk> ) is regarded as a pest species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered Hawaiian stilt ( <unk> mexicanus <unk> ) , making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds . 
 Multiple successive introductions of different non @-@ native species can have interactive effects ; the introduction of a second non @-@ native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish . Examples of this are the introductions of the amethyst gem clam ( Gemma gemma ) and the European green crab ( Carcinus maenas ) . The gem clam was introduced into California 's Bodega Harbor from the East Coast of the United States a century ago . It had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species ( <unk> spp . ) . In the mid @-@ 1990s , the introduction of the European green crab , found to prey preferentially on the native clams , resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations . 
 In the <unk> region of South Africa , cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original grassland , resulting in a massive reduction in forage for native bovids and other grazers . Since the 1970s , large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species ; partial success has led to re @-@ establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region . Examples of these species are giraffe , blue wildebeest , impala , kudu and white rhino . 
 Invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems . For example , invasive plants can alter the fire regimen ( cheatgrass , Bromus tectorum ) , nutrient cycling ( smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora ) , and hydrology ( <unk> ) in native ecosystems . Invasive species that are closely related to rare native species have the potential to hybridize with the native species . Harmful effects of hybridization have led to a decline and even extinction of native species . For example , hybridization with introduced cordgrass , Spartina alterniflora , threatens the existence of California cordgrass ( Spartina foliosa ) in San Francisco Bay . Invasive species cause competition for native species and because of this 400 of the 958 endangered species under the Endangered Species Act are at risk 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are <unk> and <unk> . For example , Kudzu Pueraria montana , a vine native to Asia was widely introduced in the southeastern USA in the early 20th century to control soil erosion . While primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation , <unk> , and <unk> . For example , invasion of Chinese mitten crab <unk> sinensis have resulted in higher bioturbation and <unk> rates . 
 = = = Economic = = = 
 = = = = Benefits = = = = 
 Non @-@ native species can have benefits . Asian oysters , for example , filter water pollutants better than native oysters . They also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives . Biologists are currently considering releasing this mollusk in the Chesapeake Bay to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution . A recent study by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found the Asian oyster could significantly benefit the bay 's deteriorating water quality . Additionally , some species have invaded an area so long ago that they have found their own beneficial niche in the environment . For example , L. leucozonium , shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in North America , has become an important pollinator of <unk> as well as cucurbit , apple trees , and blueberry bushes . 
 = = = = Costs = = = = 
 Economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry , and management costs . Estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than $ 138 billion annually . Economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues . When economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs , they are low because they do not consider environmental damage ; if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species , loss in biodiversity , and loss of ecosystem services , costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase . The following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact of biological invasions . 
 = = = = Economic opportunities = = = = 
 Some invasions offer potential commercial benefits . For instance , silver carp and common carp can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already familiar with the product , or processed into pet foods , or mink feed . Vegetative invasives such as water hyacinth can be turned into fuel by methane <unk> . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Invasive species are flora and fauna whose introduction into a habitat disrupts the native eco @-@ system . In response , <unk> is a movement that explores the idea of eating invasive species in order to control , reduce , or eliminate their populations . Chefs from around the world have begun seeking out and using invasive species as alternative ingredients . Miya 's of New Haven , Connecticut created the first invasive species menu in the world . Skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new place — such as the Indo @-@ Pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the waters of the Western Atlantic , Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico — eradication is almost impossible . Critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely . 
 Proponents of <unk> argue that humans have the ability to eat away any species that it has an appetite for , pointing to the many animals which humans have been able to hunt to extinction - such as the Dodo bird , the Caribbean monk seal , and the Passenger pigeon . Proponents of <unk> also point to the success that Jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of lionfish by encouraging the consumption of the fish . 
 = = = = Plant industry = = = = 
 Weeds reduce yield in agriculture , though they may provide essential nutrients . Some deep @-@ rooted weeds can " mine " nutrients ( see dynamic accumulator ) from the subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil , while others provide habitat for beneficial insects or provide foods for pest species . Many weed species are accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material . Many introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants , threaten young cattle ( e.g. , leafy spurge , Euphorbia <unk> ) or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines ( e.g. , yellow starthistle ) . Forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly US $ 1 billion in the U.S. alone . A decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by honey bees infected by the invasive varroa mite . Introduced rats ( Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus ) have become serious pests on farms , destroying stored grains . 
 Invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock . Citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive Asian citrus psyllid ( ACP ) . Because of the impacts of this disease on citrus crops , citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where ACP has been found .

 Aquaculture is a very common vector of species introductions – mainly of species with economic potential ( e.g. , Oreochromis niloticus ) 
 = = = = Forestry = = = = 
 The unintentional introduction of forest pest species and plant pathogens can change forest ecology and damage the timber industry . Overall , forest ecosystems in the U.S. are widely invaded by exotic pests , plants , and pathogens . 
 The Asian long @-@ horned beetle ( <unk> <unk> ) was first introduced into the U.S. in 1996 , and was expected to infect and damage millions of acres of hardwood trees . As of 2005 thirty million dollars had been spent in attempts to eradicate this pest and protect millions of trees in the affected regions . The woolly adelgid has inflicted damage on old @-@ growth spruce , fir and hemlock forests and damages the Christmas tree industry . And the chestnut blight fungus ( <unk> parasitica ) and Dutch elm disease ( Ophiostoma novo @-@ ulmi ) are two plant pathogens with serious impacts on these two species , and forest health . Garlic mustard , <unk> <unk> , is one of the most problematic invasive plant species in eastern North American forests . The characteristics of garlic mustard are slightly different from those of the surrounding native plants , which results in a highly successful species that is altering the composition and function of the native communities it invades . When garlic mustard invades the understory of a forest , it affects the growth rate of tree seedlings , which is likely to alter forest regeneration of impact forest composition in the future . 
 = = = = Tourism and recreation = = = = 
 Invasive species can impact outdoor recreation , such as fishing , hunting , hiking , wildlife viewing , and water @-@ based activities . They can damage a wide array of environmental services that are important to recreation , including , but not limited to , water quality and quantity , plant and animal diversity , and species abundance . <unk> states , " very little research has been performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such as regions , states , and watersheds . " Eurasian <unk> ( Myriophyllum spicatum ) in parts of the US , fill lakes with plants complicating fishing and boating . The very loud call of the introduced common coqui depresses real estate values in affected neighborhoods of Hawaii . 
 = = = Health = = = 
 Encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases such as HIV to the wider population . Introduced birds ( e.g. pigeons ) , rodents and insects ( e.g. mosquito , flea , louse and tsetse fly pests ) can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions . The introduced Chinese mitten crabs are carriers of Asian lung fluke . Throughout recorded history , epidemics of human diseases , such as malaria , yellow fever , typhus , and bubonic plague , spread via these vectors . A recent example of an introduced disease is the spread of the West Nile virus , which killed humans , birds , mammals , and reptiles . Waterborne disease agents , such as cholera bacteria ( Vibrio cholerae ) , and causative agents of harmful algal blooms are often transported via ballast water . Invasive species and accompanying control efforts can have long term public health implications . For instance , pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water . 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 Biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global biodiversity loss and is increasing because of tourism and globalization . This may be particularly true in inadequately regulated fresh water systems , though quarantines and ballast water rules have improved the situation . 
 Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via competitive exclusion , niche displacement , or hybridisation with related native species . Therefore , besides their economic ramifications , alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure , composition and global distribution of the biota of sites of introduction , leading ultimately to the <unk> of the world ’ s fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity . Nevertheless , it is difficult to unequivocally attribute extinctions to a species invasion , and the few scientific studies that have done so have been with animal taxa . Concern over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider the actual evidence ( either ecological or economic ) , in relation to the potential risk . 
 = = = = Genetic pollution = = = = 
 Native species can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution . Genetic pollution is unintentional hybridization and introgression , which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical or fitness advantage of the introduced species . Genetic pollution can operate either through introduction or through habitat modification , bringing previously isolated species into contact . Hybrids resulting from rare species that interbreed with abundant species can swamp the rarer species ' gene pool . This is not always apparent from morphological observations alone . Some degree of gene flow is normal , and preserves constellations of genes and genotypes . An example of this is the interbreeding of migrating coyotes with the red wolf , in areas of eastern North Carolina where the red wolf was reintroduced . 
 = = Study = = 
 While the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology , the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the field of ecology and geography where the issue of biological invasions is especially important . Much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by Charles Elton 's 1958 book The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions . Studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day . This research , which has largely consisted of field observational studies , has disproportionately been concerned with terrestrial plants . The rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events . Despite this , little standard terminology exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as " Invasion ecology " or more generally " Invasion biology " . This lack of standard terminology is a significant problem , and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture , zoology , and pathology , as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another . 
 In an attempt to avoid the ambiguous , subjective , and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers , <unk> and MacIsaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on biogeography rather than on taxa . 
 By discarding taxonomy , human health , and economic factors , this model focused only on ecological factors . The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species . It classified each population based on its success in that environment . This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species , and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful . 
 = U.S. Route 50 in Nevada = 
 U.S. Route 50 ( US 50 ) is a transcontinental highway in the United States , stretching from West Sacramento , California , in the west to Ocean City , Maryland , on the east coast . The Nevada portion crosses the center of state and was named The Loneliest Road in America by Life magazine in July 1986 . The name was intended as a pejorative , but Nevada officials seized on it as a marketing slogan . The name originates from large desolate areas traversed by the route , with few or no signs of civilization . The highway crosses several large desert valleys separated by numerous mountain ranges towering over the valley floors , in what is known as the Basin and Range province of the Great Basin . 
 US 50 has a diverse route through the state , traversing the resort communities of Lake Tahoe , the state capital in Carson City , historical sites such as Fort Churchill State Historic Park , petroglyphs , alpine forests , desert valleys , ghost towns and Great Basin National Park . 
 The route was constructed over a historic corridor , first used for the Pony Express and Central Overland Route and later for the Lincoln Highway . Before the formation of the U.S. Highway System , most of US 50 in Nevada was designated State Route 2 . The routing east of Ely has changed significantly from the original plans . The route change resulted from a rivalry between Nevada and Utah over which transcontinental route was better to serve California bound traffic , the Lincoln Highway or the Victory Highway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 50 crosses the central portion of Nevada , entering the west side of the state near Lake Tahoe and exiting the east side near Great Basin National Park . The route crosses mostly desolate terrain in the journey across the state ; US 50 passes through several large desert valleys and basins . The highway crosses 17 named mountain passes that break up the Nevada desert . To crest some of the passes along US 50 requires navigating steep 8 % grades and hairpin turns through pine forests to reach altitudes of over 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) . 
 In the stretch of highway between Fallon and Delta , Utah , a span of 409 miles ( 658 km ) , there are three small towns , Austin , Eureka and Ely . This span is roughly the same distance as Boston , Massachusetts to Baltimore , Maryland or Paris , France to Zürich , Switzerland . Traffic along US 50 varies greatly . The average annual daily traffic in 2007 ranged from 52 @,@ 000 vehicles per day in Carson City , to 530 vehicles per day near the <unk> turnoff .

 US 50 enters Nevada from California as a busy four lane thoroughfare on the shores of alpine Lake Tahoe in <unk> , Nevada . The highway follows the eastern shore , squeezing between the lake and the crest of the Carson Range . In one narrow spot , the highway cuts through the mountains via the Cave Rock Tunnel . Eventually , the route crests the Carson Range at Spooner Summit and then descends into Nevada 's capital , Carson City . Carson Street and Fairview Drive currently carry the highway through the city ; however , the Nevada Department of Transportation has announced that , upon completion , US 50 will be moved to a freeway alignment being constructed for Interstate 580 . 
 After Carson City , US 50 follows the Carson River towards the Lahontan Valley . This portion is also mostly four lane , serving the commuter towns of Dayton and Silver Springs as well as passing by Fort Churchill State Historic Park and Lahontan State Recreation Area . In addition to the trails of the Pony Express and Lincoln Highway , this portion parallels the Carson River branch of the California Trail . The Carson River forms the southern edge of the Forty Mile Desert . This desert , located between the termini of the Carson and Humboldt Rivers , was the most dreaded part of the California Trail , where travelers had to endure 40 miles ( 64 km ) of desert heat with no usable water . 
 At Silver Springs , U.S. Route 50 Alternate splits from the main route . Both branches are sometimes called the loneliest road , although the official designation begins with the first passport stamp available at Fernley , along the alternate branch . The two branches rejoin west of Fallon . Fallon , home to the Naval Air Station Fallon or TOPGUN , is an agricultural community along the last usable water of the Carson River . The town is located just south of the river 's terminus at the Carson Sink . Leaving Fallon , the highway passes by ancient petroglyph sites at Grimes Point and then Sand Mountain , a 600 @-@ foot ( 180 m ) sand dune . 
 = = = Fallon to Austin = = = 
 The scenery and level of traffic changes upon leaving the Fallon area . The road narrows from four lanes to two and crosses remote terrain characterized by Basin and Range topography . The summits start out small and gradually increase in altitude . The features in the first basins include <unk> Flat , a dry lake used by the US Navy for low level flight operations , and Dixie Valley , with several visible earthquake fault lines that resulted from the magnitude 7 @.@ 1 Dixie Valley / Fairview earthquake in 1954 . Dixie Valley is now a US Navy Electronic Warfare Range . 
 The next services are located in the single building settlement of Middlegate , a roadhouse that has served as a restaurant , bar , hotel and refueling station since the Pony Express era of the 19th century . The building features Lincoln Highway and Pony Express era artifacts as well as plaques from various historical societies confirming the station is authentic . The station is the modern turnoff to Berlin – <unk> State Park , a preserved ghost town surrounded by dinosaur remains . 
 Nearby was the site of a relatively recent attraction , a cottonwood tree with thousands of shoes dangling from it . Patrons of the bar at Middlegate are unsure of the origins ; however , most believe it started sometime in the mid @-@ 1980s . A legend has formed about how a young man was traveling to Reno with his bride to be . When she balked and got out of the car , he threw her shoes in the tree so she couldn 't get away . A reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle began to study the phenomenon of shoe trees after seeing the one at Middlegate , stating to his knowledge this was the biggest in the world . It was discovered on December 31 , 2010 , that the shoe tree had been chopped down , possibly by vandals . 
 East of Middlegate , the paths of the Pony Express , Lincoln Highway and US 50 diverge , using different passes to cross the <unk> Mountains . They rejoin west of Austin . The first paved route of the Lincoln Highway is preserved as State Route 722 . 
 = = = Austin to Ely = = = 
 Austin lies 110 miles ( 180 km ) east of Fallon . The city , founded by Pony Express riders that discovered silver , was a mining boomtown that now describes itself as a living ghost town . In 1862 , at the peak of the silver boom , Austin had a population of 10 @,@ 000 people . Today , about 300 residents remain . Perched above the town and just to the south of the highway is Stokes Castle , a long abandoned monument to a prominent eastern family with local mining interests . Passing Austin , travelers encounter hairpin turns and steep grades in the ascent up Austin Summit in the Toiyabe Range . This area is inside the Humboldt @-@ Toiyabe National Forest , the first part of US 50 to run inside a national forest since leaving Lake Tahoe . At <unk> Summit , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) east of Austin , is the <unk> Petroglyph Recreation Area , a rest area and campground featuring a walking tour of petroglyphs . 
 The next town is Eureka , which bills itself as the " <unk> Town on the Loneliest Road in America " . Eureka was similarly founded as a mining boomtown . Although mining has diminished , it remains a large component of the community and its economy . The centerpiece of the historical district of Eureka is the Eureka Opera House , built in 1880 . 
 Past Eureka is Ely , founded as a stage coach station along the Pony Express and Central Overland Route . Ely 's mining boom came later than the other towns along US 50 , with the discovery of copper in 1906 . Though the railroads connecting the First Transcontinental Railroad to the mines in Austin and Eureka have long been removed , the railroad to Ely is preserved as a heritage railway by the Nevada Northern Railway and known as the Ghost Train of Old Ely . Here US 50 departs the historical routes of the Lincoln Highway , Pony Express and State Route 2 . These routes proceeded northeast towards Salt Lake City , while US 50 joins with US 6 and US 93 heading eastward towards the state line . 
 = = = Eastern Nevada = = = 
 Ely is the last city along US 50 in Nevada . The next city is Delta , Utah , 162 miles ( 261 km ) to the east ; there are only two gas stations along the stretch between Ely and Delta . US 93 continues south from the concurrency with US 50 at Majors Place . At the Nevada – Utah border , the highway passes by The Border Inn , with a gas station and restaurant . 
 This portion of the highway is mountainous with the highest point along US 50 in Nevada at Connors Pass at 7 @,@ 729 feet ( 2 @,@ 356 m ) . This section has been designated a Scenic Byway by the Nevada Scenic Byways program . Listed attractions include the Ward Charcoal Ovens State Historic Park and Great Basin National Park . The highway enters Utah northeast of Baker in a remote portion of the Great Basin desert .

 In July 1986 , Life magazine published an article that gave US 50 in Nevada the name " The Loneliest Road in America " . The article portrayed the highway , and rural Nevada , as a place devoid of civilization . Officials from White Pine County decided to make the best of the publicity generated from the article , and convinced state authorities to do the same . Jointly , they began to use the pejorative article as a platform to market the area for visitors interested in desert scenery , history , and solitude . The Nevada Department of Transportation adopted the name in official highway logs , and placed custom Highway 50 markers along the route . 
 The Nevada Commission on Tourism sponsors a promotion where visitors can stop at several designated locations along the route and have the passport section of a state issued " survival guide " marked with a stamp representing that location . Visitors can mail in the completed passport and receive a certificate , signed by the Governor , certifying they " survived " The Loneliest Road in America . The word " survived " is a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek reference to the Life article , which quoted an American Automobile Association spokesperson as saying , " We warn all motorists not to drive there unless they 're confident of their survival skills . " 
 Since the article was published , US 50 has gained popularity among people desiring a scenic or less traveled alternative to Interstate 80 across Nevada . This increase in popularity has caused at least one writer to dispute whether US 50 still deserves the title of The Loneliest Road in America . Traffic counts on US 50 are now considerably higher than on US 6 , just to the south in Nye County . 
 The 1971 road movie Vanishing Point , notable for its on @-@ location filming across the southwest United States , used several sections of US 50 as part of the driving sequences . In 1991 , Stephen King drove along US 50 as part of a cross country trip . He stopped at Ruth , a small town near Ely . Studying the town , King fantasized about the fate of the residents . King then heard a local legend about how the ghosts of Chinese miners , who died while trapped in a cave @-@ in , can be seen crossing Highway 50 to haunt the city of Ruth . King merged these details into his own story , including references to The Loneliest Road in America , which became the novel Desperation . 
 In 2002 , Neil Peart , then taking a sabbatical from Rush , published Ghost Rider : Travels on the Healing Road , his account of a long @-@ distance motorcycle journey across Canada and the United States . He traveled across US 50 in Nevada , and remarked on the complete absence of any development on long stretches of the road , including a sign reading " No Services for 88 Miles . " 
 In 2008 , the British television show Top Gear featured the show 's presenters Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond and James May driving across Nevada along US 50 in the cars of their choice . Clarkson stated he was " mesmerised by the straightness of the road . "

 = = = Lincoln Highway = = = 
 In Nevada , US 50 was built mostly along the route of the Lincoln Highway , the first transcontinental highway in the United States , formed in 1913 . This route had been previously used by the Pony Express , an early attempt at an express mail service , started in 1860 . The Pony Express used the technique of riders changing horses at stations approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) apart to maximize speed . Some of the towns along US 50 were stops along the Pony Express . The original numbered designation of this route , which appeared on Nevada Highway maps as far back as 1919 , was State Route 2 . Route 2 had an alternate branch , Route 2A , corresponding to a split in the Lincoln Highway near Fallon . The main and alternate branches of Route 2 are reversed from the modern routings of US 50 . Mainline Route 2 , the Donner Branch , terminated at Fernley along modern US 50 Alternate . State Route 2A , the Pioneer Branch , followed mainline US 50 , terminating at Carson City . State Route 2 , and the Lincoln Highway , used a different routing between Ely and Salt Lake City , Utah from the modern routes . The original routing used what is now US 93 from Ely to the ghost town of <unk> and then dirt roads towards Tooele , Utah . 
 In 1926 , when the U.S. Highway system was announced , there was a gap in US 50 between Ely and Thistle , Utah . At the time , the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old auto trails would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway system . Utah officials refused to pave the portion of the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City . They perceived this route as being expensive to build , with no benefit for the state . Nevada officials , and the Lincoln Highway Association , pleaded with Utah authorities to change their position , even offering funds to help offset the additional cost of paving that route . However , the Lincoln highway directed travelers destined for both southern and northern California on a route away from Utah cities , towards central Nevada . Utah instead paved the Wendover Cutoff , part of the Victory Highway ( modern Interstate 80 ) , that only directed traffic for northern California out of the state . The choice not to pave the Lincoln Highway would direct travelers bound for southern California to use the Arrowhead Trail ( modern Interstate 15 ) . This route serves numerous communities in Utah , but only Las Vegas and a few other small towns in Nevada . The final blow to the original route of the Lincoln Highway was the formation of the Dugway Proving Ground , a military base used for weapons testing , which closed the area to the public . The Lincoln Highway was re @-@ routed to Salt Lake City along a circuitous route via Wendover and the Bonneville Salt Flats . This route was initially numbered US 50 from Ely to Wendover and US 40 / 50 across western Utah , but has been renumbered US 93 , US 93 Alternate and I @-@ 80 . 
 = = = Route changes = = = 
 Most of modern US 50 was pieced together from several routes designated as Nevada State Routes in the early 20th century . The portion from Lake Tahoe to Carson City was originally a portion of State Route 3 . The original designation for US 50 from Carson City to Ely was Route 2 and 2A . East of Ely was originally numbered Route 7 to the modern junction with US 93 and Route 14 from there to the Utah state line . 
 The modern route of US 50 has significantly changed since the highway was first commissioned in 1926 . The biggest change is between Ely and Green River , Utah . The first contiguous route of the highway between these cites followed the modified routing of the Lincoln Highway to Salt Lake City . The highway returned to Green River along what is now numbered UT 201 , US 89 , and US 6 . The route was changed when the more direct route between these cities ( via Delta , Utah ) was paved . The 1954 edition of the Nevada highway map was the first to show the new routing . 
 Previously , the road to Delta consisted of unpaved state routes . The paved route did not follow the exact route of the old dirt roads . The improved route bypassed the ghost town of Osceola and entered Utah approximately 14 miles ( 23 km ) to the south of the dirt road . The border crossing was moved to facilitate an easier route across western Utah . In Utah , the old road traversed a difficult route through <unk> Canyon , while the paved route followed a simpler path along the north shore of Sevier Lake . 
 Three different routes have existed between Lake Tahoe and Carson City . The original , used by the Lincoln Highway , was previously known as Johnson 's Cutoff or the Carson Ridge Emigrant Road . This route , which followed Kings Canyon to scale the Sierra Nevada , was severely damaged by a flood in 1997 . The U.S. Forest Service still promotes this road for its historical value , but has announced that it will no longer be maintained and travel is only recommended by foot , horse or four wheel drive vehicle . A portion in the lower part of the canyon inside Carson City limits was maintained by the state as Kings Canyon Road ( SR 512 ) until 2009 . In 1923 , while still known as State Route 3 , the road to Lake Tahoe was changed to follow Clear Creek Canyon , along a path that had been used for a series of tunnels and flumes , to transport timber from Lake Tahoe to the Virginia and Truckee Railroad depot in Carson City . The iteration is now known as Old Clear Creek Road . Only a small portion of Old Clear Creek Road is currently maintained by the state as unsigned SR 705 , the remainder is an access road for private residences in the canyon . The modern route , also using Clear Creek Canyon , was built in the late 1950s . 
 US 50 was rerouted through the eastern half of Fallon . The original route is not drivable as it runs through Naval Air Station Fallon ; portions are still in public use as Harrigan Road ( SR 115 ) and Berney Road ( SR 119 ) . Around 1967 , US 50 was improved between Middlegate and Austin , to bypass steep grades and sharp curves over Carroll Summit . The original route is now SR 722 . A freeway bypass , Interstate 580 , is under construction around Carson City . When finished , US 50 will be rerouted concurrent with I @-@ 580 .

 = Lockheed D @-@ 21 = 
 The Lockheed D @-@ 21 was an American reconnaissance drone with maximum speed in excess of Mach 3 @.@ 3 ( 2 @,@ 215 mph ; 3 @,@ 564 km / h ) . The D @-@ 21 was initially designed to be launched from the back of a M @-@ 21 carrier aircraft , a variant of the Lockheed A @-@ 12 aircraft . Development began in October 1962 . Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q @-@ 12 , the drone was intended for reconnaissance deep in enemy airspace . 
 The D @-@ 21 was designed to carry a single high @-@ resolution photographic camera over a preprogrammed path , then release the camera module into the air for retrieval , after which the drone would self @-@ destruct . Following a fatal accident when launched from an M @-@ 21 , the D @-@ 21 was modified to be launched from a Boeing B @-@ 52 Stratofortress . Several test flights were made , followed by four unsuccessful operational D @-@ 21 flights over the People 's Republic of China , and the program was canceled in 1971 . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 In the 1960s Lockheed 's secret Skunk Works developed the Mach 3 A @-@ 12 reconnaissance aircraft for the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) . After the shooting down of the U @-@ 2 piloted by Gary Powers in 1960 , a number of different concepts were proposed as alternatives . Kelly Johnson , the leader of Skunk Works , developed the concept of a long @-@ range drone that used much of the A @-@ 12 's technology . In October 1962 the CIA and the US Air Force instructed Lockheed to study a high @-@ speed , high @-@ altitude drone concept . Johnson specified speeds of Mach 3 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 5 , an operational altitude of 87 @,@ 000 – 95 @,@ 000 feet ( 27 @,@ 000 – 29 @,@ 000 m ) , and a range of 3 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 500 mi ; 5 @,@ 600 km ) . It was intended to make a one @-@ way trip , eject its camera payload at the end of the mission for recovery , then self @-@ destruct . It had a double @-@ delta wing similar to the A @-@ 12 's wing design . The Q @-@ 12 was to be air @-@ launched from the back of an A @-@ 12 , and used key technology from the A @-@ 12 project , including titanium construction and radar cross @-@ section reduction design features . 
 Johnson wanted to power the Q @-@ 12 with a ramjet engine built by Marquardt for the Boeing CIM @-@ 10 Bomarc long @-@ range surface @-@ to @-@ air missile . Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship . The engine , the RJ43 @-@ MA @-@ 11 , required modification , since it was only designed to burn as long as the missile needed to hit a target , while the Q @-@ 12 's engine needed to operate at high temperatures for at least an hour and a half at high altitudes . The modified engine was designated as the RJ43 @-@ <unk> @-@ 4 . 
 A full @-@ scale mockup of the Q @-@ 12 was ready by 7 December 1962 , and had already undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross @-@ section . Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ @-@ 43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime . However , the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q @-@ 12 , mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U @-@ 2 missions , getting the A @-@ 12 up to speed , and covert operations in Southeast Asia . The Air Force , however , was interested in the Q @-@ 12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile , and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone . Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full @-@ scale development of the Q @-@ 12 . 
 The camera and its film magazines with an inertial navigation system were carried in a cramped " Q @-@ bay " below the drone 's air intake . These components were built into a module that fit into the bay and was known as a " hatch " . The hatch would be ejected at the end of the mission and then snagged out of the air by a JC @-@ 130 Hercules , a technique that had been developed by the Air Force to recover film canisters from satellites . If the C @-@ 130 missed , the hatch was equipped with flotation devices so it could be recovered by ship if released over water . Honeywell built the avionics systems ; new construction techniques and materials had to be developed for the systems to withstand the high temperatures , extreme vibrations , and lack of space in the D @-@ 21 . 
 In late 1963 the project was named <unk> ; the Q @-@ 12 was re @-@ designated D @-@ 21 while the A @-@ 12 version launcher became M @-@ 21 ( D- for " daughter " and M- for " mother " ) . Two of the original 18 A @-@ 12 aircraft were designated as M @-@ 21s with serial numbers 60 @-@ <unk> and 60 @-@ <unk> . The M @-@ 21 was a two @-@ seat version of the A @-@ 12 , with a pylon on the fuselage centerline between the vertical stabilizers to carry the drone in a nose @-@ up attitude . 
 = = = Testing and carrier change = = = 
 A D @-@ 21 mounted on an M @-@ 21 began captive flight @-@ testing on 22 December 1964 . Aerodynamic covers were initially placed over the D @-@ 21 's intake and exhaust to reduce drag , but had to be removed after the first few tests , as no way of discarding them at Mach 3 without damaging the drone or carrier plane could be devised . 
 The D @-@ 21 was first launched from an M @-@ 21 on 5 March 1966 . The drone was released but stayed close to the M @-@ 21 's back for a few seconds , which seemed like " two hours " to the M @-@ 21 crew . A second launch took place on 27 April 1966 ; the D @-@ 21 reached its operational altitude of 90 @,@ 000 ft ( 27 @,@ 432 m ) and speed of over Mach 3 @.@ 3 ( 2 @,@ 215 mph ; 3 @,@ 564 km / h ) , though it was lost due to a hydraulic pump failure after a flight of over 1 @,@ 200 nmi ( 1 @,@ 400 mi ; 2 @,@ 200 km ) . The Air Force 's interest in the program continued and more D @-@ 21s were ordered after the second launch . A third flight took place on 16 June with the D @-@ 21 flying 1 @,@ 550 nmi ( 1 @,@ 780 mi ; 2 @,@ 870 km ) through its complete flight profile , though its camera hatch was not released due to an electronics failure . 
 The fourth and final launch from an M @-@ 21 on 30 July ended in disaster . Unlike the three previous launches this one was performed straight and level , not in an outside loop to assist in the separation of the drone from the aircraft . The D @-@ 21 suffered engine problems and struck the M @-@ 21 's tail after separation , leading to the destruction of both aircraft . The two crew ejected and landed at sea . The pilot , Bill Park , survived , but the Launch Control Officer , Ray <unk> , drowned . 
 Following the accident , Johnson suggested launching the D @-@ 21 from the very large Boeing B @-@ 52 Stratofortress bomber , and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up to speed . The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B @-@ 52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate . Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20 % . The modified drone version was designated D @-@ 21B ( there was no <unk> ) . Two B @-@ 52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM @-@ 28 Hound Dog cruise missiles . The tail gunner 's and electronic warfare officer 's stations were replaced with two launch control stations . Command and telemetry systems were added , and high @-@ speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons . The launch control officer on the B @-@ 52H could communicate with the D @-@ <unk> , and could make it self @-@ destruct . 
 The solid @-@ fuel booster was both larger and heavier than the drone ; it was 44 feet 4 inches ( 13 @.@ 5 m ) long and weighed 13 @,@ 286 pounds ( 6 @,@ 030 kg ) . It had a folding tail fin on the bottom to stabilize it while the rocket was firing . The booster had a burn time of 87 seconds and a thrust of 27 @,@ 300 pounds @-@ force ( 121 kN ) . During ground handling everyone within 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) was required to wear anti @-@ static straps to prevent any discharge of static electricity that might ignite the booster . 
 The first attempted launch of a D @-@ 21B was on 28 September 1967 , but the drone fell off the B @-@ 52 's launch pylon due to a stripped nut on the pylon before the aircraft reached its intended launch point . Johnson admitted that the incident was " very embarrassing " . Three more launches were performed from November 1967 through January 1968 . None were completely successful , so Johnson ordered his team to conduct a thorough review before renewing launch attempts . The next launch was on 10 April 1968 . It also failed as the engine did not ignite . On 16 June the D @-@ 21B finally made a completely successful flight ; it flew at the specified altitude and course for its full range , and the hatch was recovered . The next two launches were failures , followed by another successful flight in December . A test in February 1969 to check the inertial navigation system with an actual mission profile was a failure . The next two flights in May and July succeeded . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 Four operational missions with the D @-@ 21B took place under the codename of Senior Bowl . These were conducted over the People 's Republic of China from 9 November 1969 to 20 March 1971 to spy on the Lop Nor nuclear test site . The USAF 's <unk> Support Squadron , based at Beale Air Force Base , California , flew the missions , usually from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam . 
 The Chinese never spotted the D @-@ 21B . The first one failed to turn around and continued straight on , crashing somewhere in the Soviet Union . Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems . The second operational mission , however , was not until 16 December 1970 . The D @-@ 21B reached Lop Nor and back to the recovery point , but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs . 
 During the third operational mission , on 4 March 1971 , the D @-@ 21B flew to Lop Nor and returned , and released the hatch , which deployed its parachute , but the midair recovery failed and the hatch fell into the water . The destroyer that tried to retrieve the hatch ran it down and it sank . The fourth , and last , operational flight of the D @-@ 21B was on 20 March 1971 . It was lost over China on the final segment of the route over China 's Yunnan province ; wreckage was found by local authorities . In 2010 , after being in the junkyard of China Aviation Museum for years , the wreckage was moved to the exhibition area . 
 On 23 July 1971 , the D @-@ 21B program was canceled due to its poor success rate , the introduction of a new generation of photo reconnaissance satellites , and President Richard Nixon 's rapprochement with China . A total of 38 D @-@ 21 and D @-@ 21B drones had been built , 21 of which were expended in launches . The remaining 17 were initially stored at Norton Air Force Base , California , then moved to Davis @-@ Monthan Air Force Base " boneyard " near Tucson , Arizona , in 1976 and 1977 . With the base open to the public , the D @-@ 21 drones were quickly spotted and photographed . The Air Force called them GTD @-@ <unk> with the GT standing for Ground Training . 
 The fate of the D @-@ 21 that had disappeared on the first operational flight was finally revealed in February 1986 when an official from the CIA returned a panel to Ben Rich that he had been given by a Soviet KGB agent . The drone had self @-@ destructed over Siberia and the Soviets had recovered the wreckage . The Tupolev design bureau reverse @-@ engineered the wreck and produced plans for a Soviet copy , named the Voron ( Raven ) , but it was never built . 
 In the late 1990s NASA considered using a D @-@ 21 to test a hybrid " rocket @-@ based combined cycle " engine , which operates as a ramjet or rocket , depending on its flight regime . Ultimately NASA used a derivative of the agency 's X @-@ 43A hypersonic test vehicle for the experiments .

 William Dummer ( bapt . September 29 , 1677 ( O.S. ) [ = October 10 , 1677 ( N.S. ) ] – October 10 , 1761 ) was a politician in the Province of Massachusetts Bay . He served as its lieutenant governor for fourteen years ( 1716 – 1730 ) , including an extended period from 1723 to 1728 when he acted as governor . He is remembered for his role in leading the colony during what is sometimes called Dummer 's War , which was fought between the British colonies of northeastern North America and a loose coalition of native tribes in what is now New Hampshire , Maine , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia . 
 Dummer was born into a wealthy Massachusetts merchant family , traveling to England as a young man to participate in the business . Upon his return to Massachusetts in 1712 he entered provincial politics , gaining a royal commission as lieutenant governor through the efforts of his brother Jeremiah . He served during the turbulent tenure of Governor Samuel Shute , in which Shute quarreled with the assembly over many matters . Shute left the province quite abruptly at the end of 1722 , while it was in the middle of a war with the natives of northern New England . 
 The war was brought to a successful conclusion by Dummer . He negotiated a treaty with the Abenakis which formed the basis for a succession of later treaties . In 1728 Shute was replaced by William Burnet , whose 1 1 / 2 years in office were consumed by a vitriolic fight over his salary . Burnet died in office , and was eventually replaced in 1730 by Jonathan Belcher , who selected William Tailer to be his lieutenant . 
 Dummer then retired , dividing time between his farm in Byfield and his home in Boston . A proponent of education , he bequeathed funds for the establishment of a preparatory school in Massachusetts , and donated his Byfield estate for its use . For many years it was known as either the Dummer Academy or the Governor Dummer Academy , but is now called The Governor 's Academy . 
 = = Early life = = 
 William Dummer was born in Boston , the capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay , to Jeremiah Dummer , the first American born silversmith , and Anna ( Atwater ) Dummer . His grandfather was Richard Dummer , an early Massachusetts settler and one of the colony 's wealthiest men , and he was also related to the magistrate Samuel Sewall . Dummer was the oldest of nine children , only four of whom survived to adulthood . He was baptized at Boston 's Old South Church on September 29 , 1677 ( O.S. ) [ = October 10 , 1677 ( N.S. ) ] . 
 Little is known of Dummer 's early years . Given the family 's wealth , he probably attended the Boston Latin School , but he did not attend Harvard . His younger brother Jeremiah did go to Harvard , after which he went to Europe , studying at Leiden and Utrecht . 
 In 1702 Dummer was elected to the membership of Boston 's Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company . He went to England , most likely in the early 1700s , where he joined his extended family 's merchant business . He returned to Massachusetts in 1712 . While in England he is reported to have married a cousin in the Dummer family , whose death may have prompted his return to Massachusetts . This marriage produced no children . He then married Katherine Dudley , daughter of Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley , on April 26 , 1714 . In a gift that may have been made in anticipation of his wedding , his father in November 1712 gave him a substantial tract of land in the Byfield section of Newbury . The property became the couple 's country home . Dummer divided his time between the Newbury property and the family home in Boston . 
 Upon the death of Queen Anne in 1714 , commissions issued during her reign were set to expire . This resulted in a political scramble for appointments to the leadership of Massachusetts between Dudley 's supporters and proponents of a land bank proposal designed to deal with inflationary issuance of colonial currency . Dummer 's brother Jeremiah was in London representing the Dudley faction . Although he was unable to secure Dudley 's reappointment , he and Jonathan Belcher were able to bribe the successor chosen by the land bank faction , Elizeus Burges , to give up his commission . The commission for governor was finally issued in June 1716 to Samuel Shute , a land bank opponent , with William Dummer as lieutenant governor . Shute arrived in the colony the following October , at which time both assumed their offices . 
 = = Lieutenant governor = = 
 Dummer 's role during Governor Shute 's turbulent administration is not well documented . Shute had a difficult relationship with the provincial assembly , which refused to pay crown officials a regular salary , and objected to other policies Shute was instructed to implement . In 1720 , during these ongoing disputes , the assembly reduced the grant it made to the lieutenant governor from £ 50 to £ 35 . Dummer returned the funds , observing that his out @-@ of @-@ pocket expenses for his office even exceeded the £ 50 amount . 
 The assembly also complicated Shute 's negotiations with the restive Abenaki , who occupied lands on the province 's eastern borders ( now in the state of Maine ) and objected to the encroachment of settlers on their lands . Even though there was some desire on the part of the French and the Abenaki for a peaceful resolution to the dispute , the Massachusetts assembly , over Shute 's objections , took a hard line , cutting off trade with the Abenaki , and authorizing a militia expedition against Norridgewock , one of the main Abenaki towns . Relations deteriorated into open warfare in 1722 , and Shute declared war on the Abenaki that July . Because of the ongoing disputes with the assembly , Shute abruptly left the province for London on January 1 , 1723 , leaving Dummer to act as governor and commander @-@ in @-@ chief . Prosecution of the conflict was left to Dummer , and it has since become known as Dummer 's War ( among other names ) . 
 = = = Western frontier war = = = 
 Dummer 's tenure as acting governor has been described by historian John <unk> as " unspectacular but able " . In the first half of 1723 Dummer made concerted efforts to recruit the Iroquois ( of what is now upstate New York ) as allies against the Abenaki , and sought to avoid the participation of bands of western Abenaki ( based in what is now Vermont ) in the conflict . In both of these he was unsuccessful : the Iroquois , despite significant financial inducements , refused to take up arms against tribes seen to be allied with New France , or to engage in a conflict in which they had no stake . The Massachusetts embassy to Grey Lock , the principal leader of the western Abenakis , failed to find him . 
 In August 1723 Grey Lock began raiding Massachusetts frontier communities in the Connecticut River valley , taking captives and inflicting casualties at Northfield . Dummer appealed to the leaders of the Connecticut Colony , who stationed a company of militia there in December to little effect . He also authorized construction of a fort north of Northfield , on land he had acquired a few years before in Connecticut 's auction of the so @-@ called " equivalent lands " Massachusetts gave to Connecticut as compensation for border issues . The stockaded fort was located in what is now Brattleboro , Vermont , and was named Fort Dummer in his honor . It is regarded as the start of permanent European settlement in the modern state of Vermont . 
 Fort Dummer was ineffective at stopping the Indian raids . When Grey Lock 's raids continued unabated in 1724 , Dummer renewed his appeals to Connecticut Governor Gurdon Saltonstall , noting that Connecticut was equally vulnerable to raiding should the Massachusetts towns in the Connecticut River be abandoned . Saltonstall sent further reinforcements , but Abenaki raids in the area continued until 1727 , when Grey Lock apparently tired of continuing the war without outside support . Embassies sent by Indian commissioners in Albany , New York and by eastern Abenaki leaders failed to make contact with the warrior , and he disappeared from view . 
 = = = Eastern frontier war = = = 
 One of the disputes Shute was engaged in with the assembly at the time of his departure concerned the appointment of militia officers , something that was the governor 's prerogative . The assembly had demanded the removal of the militia commander of the eastern district ( i.e. Maine ) , Colonel Shadrach Walton . Dummer continued to argue this issue with the assembly , but eventually relented , replacing Walton with Thomas Westbrook . Westbrook led a second raid against Norridgewock in February 1723 , but the village had been abandoned for the winter . 
 The war on the eastern frontier consisted of similar raiding activities conducted by eastern Abenaki tribes , and <unk> conducted by the provincial militia of Massachusetts and New Hampshire . After Norridgewock was destroyed in a third raid in August 1724 ( an action in which the influential French Jesuit priest Sebastian Rale was killed ) , the war died down . Dummer adopted an aggressive stance after the raid , accusing the French of instigating the war and demanding their neutrality . 
 Peace negotiations began in early 1725 in Boston with the Penobscot leaders Wenemouet and <unk> . Dummer led the negotiations , taking a hard line . He refused in principle to halt settlement activities in contested territories , but allowed the Penobscots to retain a Roman Catholic priest . He also pressured Wenemouet to bring Grey Lock and other Abenaki leaders to the peace table . These talks led to a preliminary peace with only the Penobscots at the end of July 1725 . Wenemouet then took up the peace cause within the wider Wabanaki Confederacy , sending belts of wampum representing peace to the other tribes . After a translation of the written treaty by a French priest revealed differences between what it stated and what was negotiated , <unk> repudiated the written treaty in January 1726 . At a peace conference held in August 1726 the Penobscots attempted to argue against the offending language , but were convinced to sign the treaty anyway . The Penobscots , despite their reservations , promoted this peace within the confederacy , and reported in March 1727 that all of the tribes except Grey Lock 's band had agreed to it . A final major peace conference held at Casco Bay in July 1727 formally closed hostilities , and included Dummer , New Hampshire 's Acting Governor John Wentworth , Nova Scotia 's military commander Paul Mascarene , and many representatives of the Wabanaki Confederacy . 
 The treaty that Dummer negotiated became a staple of diplomacy between Massachusetts and the eastern tribes despite the discrepancies between written and oral versions . Every major treaty meeting for the next fifty years included a restatement of its terms . 
 = = = Other policies = = = 
 Dummer sought to be generally conciliatory in his dealings with the provincial legislature , tolerating , for example , the selection of Elisha Cooke ( who had led the opposition to Shute ) as speaker of the assembly . He finessed the assembly 's attempts to interfere with management of the militia by organizing expeditions when the body was not in session , earning the enmity of opponents when it did meet . The assembly refused to appropriate funds to pay soldier salaries , leading to a rise in desertions . They also retaliated by firing his brother Jeremiah ( who was widely seen as a supporter of the Shute @-@ Dudley @-@ Dummer faction ) as colonial agent . 
 Shute 's complaints to London resulted in the eventual issuance by the Privy Council of an Explanatory Charter for the province , in which the council sided with Shute on all of the major issues . Shute was preparing to return to Massachusetts in 1727 when King George I died . King George II chose to give the Massachusetts governorship to William Burnet instead of renewing Shute 's commission , and he renewed Dummer 's commission as lieutenant governor . 
 The matter of colonial currency arose again in 1726 . Dummer had been instructed to only allow new issues under exceptional circumstances , and £ 100 @,@ 000 was due to be retired . The assembly proposed to circumvent the need for an exception by allocating the issue for the repair of fortifications , something for which Dummer had requested funding . Since the proposed currency issuance greatly exceeded the amount needed for repairs , Dummer vetoed the request and dissolved the assembly . When the assembly met in 1727 , Dummer kept the body in session for 165 days , demanding it act on the mandated currency withdrawal . The assembly threatened to withhold his salary , and ultimately retired £ 40 @,@ 000 of currency before Dummer relented . The matter had significantly poisoned the atmosphere when Burnet arrived in July 1728 to take office . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Burnet 's short administration was primarily consumed by a vitriolic dispute over the assembly 's failure to grant him a regular salary . After Burnet died suddenly on September 7 , 1729 , Dummer resumed acting as governor and commander @-@ in @-@ chief . He remained in office until June 11 , 1730 , when he was replaced by William Tailer , who had been selected by incoming Governor Jonathan Belcher as his lieutenant . 
 After he was replaced as lieutenant governor , Dummer apparently retired into private life as a successful gentleman farmer . He is reported to have served on the provincial council , but there are no further public records of note , and he left no letters or other papers . He died at home on October 10 , 1761 , and was interred in Boston 's Granary Burying Ground six days later .

 Dummer made several charitable bequests in his will . He gave £ 200 to Harvard College , as well as a £ 50 grant for the purchase of books , and partially endowed two professorial chairs . His single largest gift was the grant of his Newbury property for a preparatory school . First called the Dummer Charity School , it opened on February 27 , 1763 . In its later history it was known as Dummer Academy , and until recently , Governor Dummer Academy . In July 2006 it changed to The Governor 's Academy ( the benefactor 's surname sounded uncomfortably like " dumber , " it was decided , and thus elicited predictable taunts during sport meets ) . Dummer 's Georgian mansion remains a central feature of the school campus , now serving as the headmaster 's residence . 
 The towns of Dummer , New Hampshire and <unk> , Vermont were also named in his honor .

 The MacBook Pro ( sometimes abbreviated MBP ) is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc . , now in its third generation . Replacing the PowerBook G4 , the MacBook Pro was the second model to be announced in the Apple – Intel transition , after the iMac . It is the high @-@ end model of the MacBook family and is currently produced with 13- and 15 @-@ inch screens . A 17 @-@ inch version was available for sale in April 2006 . 
 The first generation MacBook Pro appeared externally similar to the PowerBook G4 , but used the Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips . The 15 @-@ inch model was introduced first , in January 2006 ; the 17 @-@ inch model followed in April . Both received several updates and Core 2 Duo processors later that year . 
 The computer 's second generation , known as the " unibody " model , has a more tapered design and a casing made from a single block of aluminum . It debuted in October 2008 as the 15 @-@ inch MacBook Pro and the 13 @-@ inch aluminum unibody MacBook . The following January brought the design to the 17 @-@ inch model , along with the built @-@ in battery that joined the rest of the MacBook Pro line in June , during which Apple also absorbed the plastic exterior 13 " Macbook into the MacBook Pro line . Subsequent updates brought upgraded Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and introduced Intel 's Thunderbolt technology . 
 Apple released the third generation of MacBook Pro in June 2012 with a 15 @-@ inch screen . At the same time , the 17 @-@ inch variant was discontinued , and slightly updated versions of the previous generation 13- and 15 @-@ inch unibody models were announced and sold in parallel . While dimensionally smaller than its predecessor , the similarly styled third generation model retained a unibody design . The most substantial differences in the third generation MacBook Pro are the fitting of a significantly higher resolution Retina Display , the elimination of the optical drive , and replacement of hard disk drives with solid @-@ state drives . A 13 @-@ inch third generation MacBook Pro was released in October 2012 . 
 = = First generation = = 
 The original 15 @-@ inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10 , 2006 by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo . The 17 @-@ inch model was unveiled on April 24 , 2006 . The first design is largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4 , but uses Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips . The 15 @-@ inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15 @-@ inch aluminum PowerBook G4 , but is 0 @.@ 1 inches ( 0 @.@ 25 cm ) deeper , 0 @.@ 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 0 cm ) wider , and 0 @.@ 1 inches ( 0 @.@ 25 cm ) thinner . Other changes from the PowerBook include a built @-@ in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe , a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when pulled to prevent the entire laptop from being pulled off a surface . Both features were later brought over to the MacBook . In order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro , the optical drive is half the speed of the one in the PowerBook G4 and cannot write to dual layer DVDs . 
 Both the original 15- and 17 @-@ inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard / 34 slots , which replace the PC Card slots found in the PowerBook G4 . All pre @-@ unibody 15 @-@ inch models have two USB 2 @.@ 0 ports and one FireWire 400 port , while the 17 @-@ inch models have three USB 2 @.@ 0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port . When first introduced , the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S @-@ Video ports , although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15 @-@ inch model revision and is present in every version of the 17 @-@ inch design . S @-@ Video capability can be attained through the use of a DVI to S @-@ Video adapter . External displays with up to a 2 @,@ 560 × 1 @,@ 600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual @-@ link DVI port . All models include a built @-@ in Gigabit Ethernet port , Bluetooth 2 @.@ 0 , and <unk> / b / g . Later models include support for the draft 2 @.@ 0 specification of 802.11n and Bluetooth 2 @.@ 1 .

 Apple refreshed the entire MacBook Pro line on October 24 , 2006 to include Intel Core 2 Duo processors . Memory capacity was doubled for each model , to 1 GB on the low @-@ end 15 @-@ inch and 2 GB for the high @-@ end 15- and 17 @-@ inch models . FireWire 800 was added to the 15 @-@ inch models . Hard drive capacity was increased , although video card options stayed the same . The MacBook Pro line received a second update on June 5 , 2007 with new Nvidia Geforce <unk> GT video cards and faster processor options . LED backlighting was added to the 15 @-@ inch model 's screen , and its weight was reduced from 5 @.@ 6 pounds ( 2 @.@ 5 kg ) to 5 @.@ 4 pounds ( 2 @.@ 4 kg ) . Furthermore , the speed of the front @-@ side bus was increased from 667 MHz to 800 MHz . On November 1 , 2007 , Apple added the option of a 2 @.@ 6 GHz Santa Rosa platform Core 2 Duo CPU as well as reconfigured hard drive options . 
 On February 26 , 2008 , the MacBook Pro line was again updated . LED backlighting was added as an option for the 17 @-@ inch model . Processors were updated to " Penryn " cores , which are built on the 45 nanometer process ( 65 nanometer " Merom " cores were previously used ) , and hard drive and memory capacities were increased . Multi @-@ touch capabilities , first introduced with the MacBook Air earlier that year , were brought over to the MacBook Pro 's trackpad . When the 15 @-@ inch unibody MacBook Pro was introduced on October 14 , 2008 , the pre @-@ unibody model with the same screen size was discontinued , while the 17 @-@ inch pre @-@ unibody model continued to be sold . The original case design was discontinued on January 6 , 2009 , when the 17 @-@ inch MacBook Pro was also updated with unibody construction .

 Some reviewers applauded the MacBook Pro for its doubling or tripling the speed of the PowerBook G4 in some areas . For example , the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3 @.@ 3 times as fast ( 2 @.@ 3 times faster ) , and its boot @-@ up time was more than twice as quick . The MacBook Pro generally outperformed the PowerBook G4 in performance analyzer utility tests <unk> and <unk> . Reviewers lauded the screen 's maximum brightness , 67 percent higher than the PowerBook G4 ; the excellent horizontal viewing angles ; the matte options ; and the bright , crisp , and true colors . Although the screen offered fewer vertical pixels ( 1 @,@ 440 × 900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1 @,@ 440 × 960 in the PowerBook ) , one reviewer called the screen " nothing less than stellar " . Reviewers praised the new MagSafe power adapter , although one reviewer said it disconnected too easily in some instances . They also praised the backlit keyboard , large trackpad , and the virtually silent operation of the machine . The new laptop also offered better wireless performance . 
 One reviewer criticized the decision to <unk> the ATI Mobility Radeon <unk> graphics card by about 30 percent its original speed . The notebook was also noted for running hot . Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks . Since the dimensions for the 15 @-@ inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15 @-@ inch PowerBook G4 , older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models . Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings . Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh , going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60 , but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power . Battery life therefore remained about the same as in previous models , at three @-@ plus hours .

 On October 14 , 2008 , in a press event at company headquarters , Apple officials announced a new 15 @-@ inch MacBook Pro featuring a " precision aluminum unibody enclosure " and tapered sides similar to those of the MacBook Air . Designers shifted the MacBook Pro 's ports to the left side of the case , and moved the optical disc drive slot from the front to the right side , similar to the MacBook . The new MacBook Pros had two new video cards : the Nvidia GeForce <unk> GT with either 256 or 512 MB of dedicated memory and a GeForce 9400M with 256 MB of shared system memory . Although the FireWire 400 port was removed , the FireWire 800 port was retained . The DVI port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort receptacle . The original unibody MacBook Pro came with a user @-@ removable battery ; Apple claimed five hours of use , with one reviewer reporting results closer to four on a continuous video battery stress test . Apple said that the battery would hold 80 percent of its charge after 300 recharges .

 The unibody @-@ construction MacBook Pro largely follows the styling of the original aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor , albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display . The screen is high @-@ gloss , covered by an edge @-@ to @-@ edge reflective glass finish , while an anti @-@ glare matte option is available in the 15- and 17 @-@ inch models in which the glass panel is removed . The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button . The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model 's , giving more room for scrolling and multi @-@ touch gestures . When the line was updated in April 2010 , inertial scrolling was added , making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad . The keys , still backlit , are now that of Apple 's now @-@ standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys .

 During the MacWorld Expo keynote on January 6 , 2009 , Phil Schiller announced a 17 @-@ inch MacBook Pro with unibody construction . This version diverged from its 15 @-@ inch sibling with an anti @-@ glare " matte " screen option ( with the glossy finish standard ) and a non user @-@ removable lithium polymer battery . Instead of traditional round cells inside the casing , the lithium @-@ ion polymer batteries are shaped and fitted into each laptop to maximally utilize space . Adaptive charging , which uses a chip to optimize the charge flow to reduce wear and tear , extends the battery 's overall life . Battery life for the 17 " version is quoted at eight hours , with 80 percent of this charge remaining after 1 @,@ 000 charge @-@ discharge cycles . 
 At Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) on June 8 , 2009 , it was announced that the 13 @-@ inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re @-@ branded as a MacBook Pro , leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line . It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user @-@ removable battery first introduced in the 17 @-@ inch MacBook Pro . The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15 @-@ inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life , while the 17 @-@ inch would keep its eight @-@ hour capacity . Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15 @-@ inch MacBook Pros during casual use , while others reported around six hours . Like the 17 @-@ inch MacBook Pro , Apple claims that they will last around 1 @,@ 000 charge cycles while still containing 80 percent of their capacity . Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release , although the 13 @-@ inch and the base model 15 @-@ inch , came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU . The screens were also improved , gaining a claimed 60 percent greater color gamut . All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17 @-@ inch models would receive an SD card slot . The 17 @-@ inch model would retain its ExpressCard / 34 slot . For the 13 @-@ inch MacBook Pro , the Kensington lock slot was moved to the right side of the chassis . In August 2009 , Apple extended the " matte " anti @-@ glare display option to the 15 @-@ inch MacBook Pro . 
 On April 13 , 2010 , Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs were introduced in the 15- and 17 @-@ inch models , while the 13 @-@ inch retained the Core 2 Duo with a speed increase . The power brick was redesigned and a high @-@ resolution display ( of 1 @,@ 680 × 1 @,@ 050 ) was announced as an option for the 15 @-@ inch models . The 13 @-@ inch gained an integrated Nvidia GeForce <unk> graphics processing unit ( GPU ) with 256 MB of shared memory , while the 15- and 17 @-@ inch models were upgraded to the GeForce GT <unk> , with either 256 or 512 MB of dedicated memory . The 15- and 17 @-@ inch models also have an integrated Intel GPU that is built into the Core i5 and i7 processors . The 15 @-@ inch model also gained 0 @.@ 1 pounds ( 0 @.@ 045 kg ) . Save for a third USB 2 @.@ 0 slot , all the ports on the 17 @-@ inch MacBook Pro are the same in type and number as on the 15 @-@ inch version . All models come with 4 GB of system memory that is upgradeable to 8 GB . Battery life was also extended further in this update , to an estimated ten hours for the 13 @-@ inch and 8 – 9 hours on the 15- and 17 @-@ inch MacBook Pros . This was achieved through both greater power efficiency and adding more battery capacity . One reviewer reported about six hours of battery life through a continuous video battery stress test in the 15 @-@ inch and another , who called the battery life " unbeatable , " reported nearer to eight in the 13 @-@ inch through their " highly demanding battery drain test " . 
 Thunderbolt technology , Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 ( on the 13 @-@ inch model ) or quad @-@ core i7 ( on the 15- and 17 @-@ inch models ) processors , and a high definition FaceTime camera were added on February 24 , 2011 . Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU , while the 15- and 17 @-@ inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD <unk> and Radeon HD <unk> graphics cards . Later editions of these models , following the release of OS X Lion , replaced the dashboard ( F4 ) key with a launchpad key . The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models . The Thunderbolt serial bus platform can achieve speeds of up to 10 Gbit / s , which is up to twice as fast as the USB 3 @.@ 0 specification , 20 times faster than the USB 2 @.@ 0 specification , and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800 . Apple says that Thunderbolt can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time . 
 On June 11 , 2012 , Apple showcased its upgraded Mac notebooks , OS X Mountain Lion , and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) in San Francisco . The new MacBook Pro models were updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3 @.@ 0 ports , and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB . Following this announcement , the 17 @-@ inch model was discontinued . After a media event on October 22 , 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros except for the entry @-@ level 2 @.@ 5 GHz 13 @-@ inch model .

 Some reviewers praised the new laptop 's performance and compact size , the quality of the screen , and sturdy unibody build , which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models . Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines . Others , however , criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design . 
 Reviewers lamented the loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro , noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight , even when its brightness was turned all the way up . CNET 's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid @-@ 2009 models : " According to Apple , the new display offers a wider color gamut , and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful , but we wish the same matte @-@ screen option offered on the 17 @-@ inch MacBook Pro was available across the line ... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits , the edge @-@ to @-@ edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease , making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions . " By 2011 , matte screens were offered for both the 15 " and 17 " models . Furthermore , the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized . The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned . 
 Laptop Magazine 's Michael Prospero praised the 2010 15 @-@ inch model 's display , calling it " bright and crisp " . He further commented , " While reflections from the glossy display weren 't overwhelming , it 's also nice to know there 's an <unk> option — though only for the higher resolution display . Still , colors were bright , blacks were deep and dark , and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally . " He also lauded the quality of the iSight webcam , the responsiveness of the touchpad , the microphone and speakers , as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15 " model and the long battery life . Complaints included the price of the laptop , the low number of USB ports , and the lack of HDMI . 
 CNET praised the automatic graphics switching features of the 15- and 17 @-@ inch 2010 models as well as the graphics cards themselves . Acclaim was also given to the Core i5 and i7 CPUs , the multi @-@ touch trackpad , and the addition of audio capabilities to the Mini DisplayPort video output . They also called for the addition of HDMI and the Blu @-@ ray optical disc format , saying that most other computers in the MacBook Pro 's price range possessed these features . CNET also criticized the option of a higher resolution screen in the 15 @-@ inch model , saying that " the higher @-@ resolution screen should be included by default . "

 Early and Late 2011 models reportedly suffer from manufacturing problems leading to overheating , graphical issues , and eventually complete GPU and logic board failure . A thread was opened on the Apple Support community that reached more than 12 @,@ 000 posts and 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 visits ( Feb 2015 ) . A similar but nonidentical issue affected iMac GPUs which were later recalled by Apple . The problem was covered by many articles in Mac @-@ focused magazines , starting late 2013 throughout 2014 . In August 2014 the law firm Whitfield Bryson & Mason LLP had begun investigating the problem to determine if any legal claim exists . On October 28 , 2014 , the firm announced that it has filed a class @-@ action lawsuit in a California federal court against Apple . The lawsuit will cover residents residing in both California and Florida who have purchased a 2011 MacBook Pro notebook with an AMD graphics card . The firm is also investigating similar cases across the United States . On February 20 , 2015 , Apple instituted the " MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues " . This " will repair affected MacBook Pro systems , free of charge . "

 On June 11 , 2012 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco , Apple introduced the third generation MacBook Pro , marketed as the " MacBook Pro with Retina display " to differentiate it from the updated second generation models of the previous generation released the same day . The new model includes Intel 's third generation Core i7 processors ( Ivy Bridge microarchitecture ) , USB 3 @.@ 0 , and a high @-@ resolution 15 @.@ 4 " IPS 2880 × 1800 @-@ pixel Retina Display . Other new or changed features include a second Thunderbolt port , an HDMI port , and a new thinner MagSafe port , dubbed the " MagSafe 2 " . Apple introduced a 13 @-@ inch version on October 23 , 2012 with specifications similar but slightly inferior to the 15 @-@ inch version 's , such as less powerful processors . 
 The new models omit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports , though Apple offers Thunderbolt adapters for both interfaces . They also omit a SuperDrive , making the 15 @-@ inch model Apple 's first professional notebook since the PowerBook <unk> to ship without a built @-@ in optical drive . Instead of a hard disk drive , the new models ship with a solid state drive housed in a proprietary flash module design rather than a 2 @.@ 5 " notebook drive . Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans . The new case design does not have a Kensington lock slot , so alternative products are required to physically secure the computer . 
 The Retina models also have fewer user @-@ accessible upgrade or replacement options than previous MacBooks . Unlike in previous generations , the memory is soldered onto the logic board and is therefore not upgradable . The solid state drive is not soldered and can be replaced with a larger unit . The battery is glued into place ; attempts to remove it may destroy the battery and / or trackpad . The entire case uses proprietary <unk> screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools . While the battery is glued in , recycling companies have stated that the design is only " mildly inconvenient " and does not hamper the recycling process . 
 On February 13 , 2013 , Apple announced updated prices and processors for the MacBook Pro with Retina Display and increased the RAM of the high @-@ end 15 @-@ inch model to 16 GB . 
 On October 22 , 2013 , Apple updated the line with Intel 's Haswell processors and Iris Graphics , 802.11ac Wi @-@ Fi , Thunderbolt 2 , and PCIe @-@ based flash storage . The chassis of the 13 @-@ inch version was slightly slimmed to 0 @.@ 71 inches ( 18 mm ) to match the 15 @-@ inch model . The lower @-@ end 15 @-@ inch model only included integrated graphics while the higher @-@ end model continued to include a discrete Nvidia graphics card in addition to integrated graphics . Support for 4K video output via HDMI was added but limited the maximum number of external displays from three to two . On July 29 , 2014 Apple announced updated prices and processors for the Haswell MacBook Pro with Retina Display . 
 On March 9 , 2015 , the 13 @-@ inch model was updated with Intel Broadwell processors , Iris 6100 graphics , faster flash storage , increased battery life , and a Force Touch trackpad . On May 19 , 2015 , the 15 @-@ inch model was also updated with similarly fast flash storage , increased battery life , the Force Touch trackpad , and an AMD Radeon R9 discrete graphics card on the higher @-@ end model . The higher @-@ end 15 @-@ inch model also added support for dual @-@ cable output to <unk> × 2880 displays . The 15 @-@ inch models were released with the same Intel Haswell processors and Iris Pro graphics as the 2014 models due to a delay in shipping the newer Broadwell quad @-@ core processors .

 The Retina Display MacBook Pro largely follows the design of the previous generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys . The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner bezel and the removal of the internal optical drive . The power button is moved from the upper right corner of the chassis onto the keyboard , taking the place of the optical disc eject button . At 0 @.@ 71 inches ( 18 mm ) thick , the 15 @-@ inch model is 25 percent thinner than its predecessor . The model name , i.e. Macbook Pro , is not longer placed at the bottom of the screen bezel , instead , it is found on the underside of the chassis , similar to an iOS device . This is the first Macintosh laptop to not have a model name on its bezel .
