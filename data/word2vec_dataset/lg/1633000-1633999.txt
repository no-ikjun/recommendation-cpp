 = = = Second capitol = = = 
 Plans for a new building began to take shape in 1872 when the state legislature appropriated $ 100 @,@ 000 ( $ 2 million as of 2016 ) towards a new capitol building . This second capitol , built between 1873 and 1876 , was a two @-@ story structure with an additional first level that was partly underground ; the total cost was $ 325 @,@ 000 ( $ 7 @.@ 2 million as of 2016 ) . The cornerstone for the building was laid on October 5 , 1873 , during a ceremony that included a speech by Governor Stephen F. Chadwick and the music of several bands . Construction , on the same site as the 1855 building , was partly accomplished with convict labor from the Oregon State Penitentiary . Architects Justus F. <unk> and W.G. Gilbert designed the building . 
 Built of stone and five million bricks , Oregon 's new capitol measured 275 by 136 feet ( 84 by 41 m ) with a dome of 180 feet ( 55 m ) . The ground story was of native Oregon sandstone from the Umpqua region . The structure had a square rotunda on the interior that was 54 feet ( 16 m ) tall . Also inside was a Senate chamber measuring 75 by 45 feet ( 23 by 14 m ) and a House chamber of 85 by 75 feet ( 26 by 23 m ) . On the top floor was the Oregon Supreme Court with a courtroom measuring 54 by 45 feet ( 16 by 14 m ) and the Oregon State Law Library , 75 by 70 feet ( 23 by 21 m ) . Also on the top floor was a viewing gallery for the House . On the exterior were ornamental pilasters and two @-@ story porticos on the east and west ends . The building included a lunch counter . Additionally , the building had mullion @-@ windowed wings . The large copper @-@ clad dome was constructed with an iron and steel framework . This dome rose 54 feet ( 16 m ) above the rest of the building and was 100 feet ( 30 m ) tall . The building was of Renaissance style with Corinthian columns on the front entrance and was patterned after the United States Capitol . At that time , the capitol faced west toward the Willamette River . The government began using the building in August 1876 , before the dome was built . Originally , plans called for towers on both sides of the dome ( a tower on both ends of the building with the dome in the middle ) , but they were left out to save money . Oregon 's second capitol building stood from 1876 to 1935 . 
 = = = = Fire = = = = 
 On April 25 , 1935 at 6 : 43 pm , a custodial engineer called the Salem Fire Department to report smoke . Citizens helped to remove items from the smoky building , but when firefighters arrived , they ordered everyone to leave the structure , which was soon engulfed in flame . Among the helping citizens was twelve @-@ year @-@ old Mark Hatfield , who later became governor . It was determined the fire started in the basement of the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records . A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome 's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories . The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky . 
 Flames could be seen as far away as Corvallis . One volunteer firefighter , Floyd McMullen , a student at Willamette University , died in the fire , which drew firefighters from as far away as Portland . Salem sent seven fire trucks to the scene ; three more came from Portland . Only the outer walls were left standing after the fire was extinguished . Losses were estimated at $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( $ 25 @.@ 9 million as of 2016 ) , and the state did not carry insurance . The losses , which included historic artifacts such as the portraits of all the governors , could have been worse had the state not used fire @-@ proof vaults in the basement to store valuables such as more than $ 1 million ( $ 17 @.@ 3 million as of 2016 ) in stocks and bonds . During the blaze , firefighters poured water on these vaults to help keep them cool and prevent the contents from disintegrating . Years earlier , the state had turned over many historical documents to the Oregon Historical Society in Portland for preservation , and those records were preserved . Although the Supreme Court had moved to the Oregon Supreme Court Building in 1914 , the two buildings were connected by underground tunnels used for electricity and heating . At the time of the fire , the Oregon State Library was in the basement and first floor of the Supreme Court Building . Many books in the basement suffered water damage when water used to fight the fire flooded underground tunnels and seeped into the Supreme Court Building . Offices previously housed in the capitol were moved to other government buildings and to leased space in downtown Salem until a new building was built . 
 = = = Third capitol = = = 
 Construction of the newest building began on December 4 , 1936 . The third state capitol was completed in 1938 and is the fourth @-@ newest capitol in the United States . The capitol was dedicated on October 1 , 1938 , with speeches from President Franklin D. Roosevelt , Leslie M. Scott , Robert W. Sawyer , and Oregon Governor Charles Henry Martin . Chosen from 123 entries in a countrywide competition , the design of the new building deviated from the normal design of state capitol buildings . The design was labeled a combination of Egyptian simplicity and Greek refinement . Overall it is Art Deco in style , and is one of only three state capitols in the United States constructed in that architectural style . 
 Controversy occurred before construction began when Governor Martin suggested the new building be sited on a hill south of downtown ( <unk> Heights ) and away from the busy center of town . Another proposal called for the purchase of the Willamette University campus and relocation of the capitol to that site . However , downtown merchants were able to keep the capitol building in downtown at the original location , though some Victorian homes were subsequently leveled to make way for the building . Another early complaint about the structure was that the cupola resembled a " paint can " rather than traditional domes on other capitols , including the earlier Oregon structures . It was even called a " squirrel cage " , lacking in majesty . Additionally , the public was slow to admire the gold Oregon Pioneer atop the dome . Installation of the statue began on September 17 , 1938 , and took several days and heavy @-@ duty equipment . 
 The building cost $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( $ 43 million as of 2016 ) , of which the federal government paid 45 percent through the Public Works Administration . Upon completion , the new capitol was 164 feet ( 50 m ) wide , 400 feet ( 120 m ) long , and 166 feet ( 51 m ) tall ( 50 by 122 by 51 m ) and contained 131 @,@ 750 square feet ( 12 @,@ 240 m2 ) of usable space . The exterior was finished with Vermont marble . The lobby , rotunda , and halls were lined with a polished rose travertine stone quarried in Montana . The rotunda 's staircases and floor used Phoenix Napoleon marble quarried in Missouri and have borders of Radio Black marble that , like the exterior stone , is from Vermont . 158 names of notable Oregonians are inscribed on the walls of the legislative chambers ; of these , only six are women . The original cost estimate for the building was $ 3 @.@ 5 million ( $ 60 million as of 2016 ) , but the state legislature only appropriated $ 2 @.@ 5 million ; committee rooms were subsequently removed from the plans . These rooms were added in 1977 as part of a $ 12 @.@ 5 million ( $ 49 million as of 2016 ) expansion project to add new wings containing legislative offices , hearing rooms , support services , a first floor <unk> , and underground parking . This addition doubled the space of the capitol building . In 2002 , the wings were remodeled at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 3 million ( $ 1 @.@ 7 million as of 2016 ) to upgrade items such as antiquated wiring and to install new carpeting and lighting . 
 On March 25 , 1993 , the magnitude 5 @.@ 6 Scotts Mills earthquake damaged the dome , requiring closure for repairs . The rotunda area remained closed for approximately two years for these repairs . This " Spring Break Quake " shook the building enough to shift the statue on top and crack the dome . Additionally , the quake created a three @-@ foot ( one @-@ meter ) bulge on the west end of the building . Repairs cost $ 4 @.@ 3 million ( $ 7 million as of 2016 ) and included reinforcing the structure with additional concrete and steel bars . 
 In April 2002 , the building became the first state capitol in the United States to produce solar power through the use of 60 photovoltaic panels generating 7 @.@ 8 kilowatts . One @-@ third of the power is used to light the Oregon Pioneer at night ; the remaining electricity is sent into the power grid . 
 On December 31 , 2007 , the Oregon State Capitol hosted its first authorized wedding between Oregon State Representative Tobias Read and Heidi Eggert . At Read 's encouragement , the Legislature created a policy authorizing up to four public events a year . On August 30 , 2008 , the building caught fire around 12 : 30 in the morning and was quickly extinguished with damage to the Governor 's offices on the second floor on the south side . The governor was forced to relocate some of his offices , including some time at the Oregon State Library across the street . 
 = = Exterior and interior = = 
 The Oregon State Capitol is home to both branches of the state legislature , the House and Senate , and has offices for the governor , treasurer , and the secretary of state . In its center , the floor of the prominent rotunda features an embedded Oregon State Seal sculpted in bronze by Ulric Ellerhusen . Ellerhusen also sculpted the Oregon Pioneer that rests atop the capitol dome 's exterior . The dome rises 106 feet ( 32 m ) above the state seal . The interior of the dome was painted by Frank H. Schwarz and features 33 stars , symbolizing Oregon 's place as the 33rd state to join the Union . Eight medallions are painted near the top of the walls of the rotunda that represent the eight objects in the state seal . Also encircling the interior of the rotunda are four murals depicting moments from Oregon history . One mural depicts Captain Robert Gray 's exploration of the Columbia River in 1792 , another shows the Lewis and Clark Expedition , and two others portray covered wagons from pioneer times . These four murals were painted by Schwarz and Barry Faulkner . Other murals include the Provisional Government of Oregon 's salmon and wheat seal , the Oregon Territory 's seal , and depictions of Oregon 's industries , all located in the rotunda 's wings along the grand staircase . The capitol 's <unk> area on the first floor includes hearing rooms , display cases , and the visitor information area . 
 Oregon 's House chamber floor is covered with a custom carpet ; the carpet 's pattern incorporates a depiction of the state tree , Douglas @-@ fir , representative of forestry . The furniture and paneling of the chamber is made of golden oak . A large mural painted by Faulkner , depicting the 1843 Champoeg Meetings at which the provisional government was formed , is behind the desk of the Speaker of the House . The Senate chambers use black walnut for the paneling and furniture . Another custom carpet lines the floor , featuring Chinook salmon and wheat , representative of fishing and agriculture . The Senate 's large mural was painted by Schwarz and depicts a street scene showing news of statehood reaching Salem . Lining the walls of both chambers are 158 names , inscribed in friezes , of prominent people in Oregon 's history . On the second floor of the capitol is the Governor 's suite , consisting of a ceremonial office and private offices for the state 's chief executive . As in the Senate chamber , the paneling is of black walnut . The ceremonial office includes a fireplace with a painting by Faulkner . In the suite 's reception area is a table made of 40 tree species . This table is inlaid with a replica of Oregon 's second capitol building , the state flower ( Oregon @-@ grape ) , and the state bird ( western meadowlark ) . 
 A variety of artwork is displayed on the exterior of the building . Sculptor Leo Friedlander used Vermont marble for the large relief sculptures on both sides of the main entrance . One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis , William Clark , and Sacagawea , with a map of their expedition 's route on the reverse ; the other ( Covered Wagon ) shows pioneers and a covered wagon , with a map of the Oregon Trail on the reverse . Additionally , Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior , and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance . Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building 's main entrance , three on the inside and three on the outside . 
 The building measures 693 by 259 @.@ 5 ft ( 211 @.@ 2 by 79 @.@ 1 m ) . The older main portion of the building is 53 @.@ 5 feet ( 16 @.@ 3 m ) tall , while the newer wings added in 1977 are 68 @.@ 7 feet ( 20 @.@ 9 m ) tall . Inside , the building has approximately 233 @,@ 750 square feet ( 21 @,@ 716 m2 ) of floor area and 3 @.@ 2 million cubic feet ( 90 @,@ 600 cubic meters ) of volume . 
 In 1997 , the Legislative Assembly established the non @-@ profit Oregon State Capitol Foundation in order to " create a living history , enhance the dignity and beauty of the Capitol , and foster cultural and educational opportunities . " In 2005 , the foundation completed the Walk of the Flags project , a display in Willson Park on the capitol grounds of all 50 flags of the U.S. states . 
 In 2007 , the capitol wings closed for a restoration project to upgrade items such as furniture , plumbing , and electrical systems . The $ 34 million project became an issue in the 2008 Senate campaign between Gordon Smith and Jeff Merkley when Smith used the price of the project in ads attacking Merkley who was the Speaker of the Oregon House when the remodel was approved . Part of the attack involved the cost of new desks for legislators and staff that were manufactured by Oregon prison inmates . Renovations were completed in November 2008 . 
 = = Grounds = = 
 The capitol grounds cover three city blocks and include Willson and Capitol parks . Near the west entrance of the capitol is a replica of Philadelphia 's Liberty Bell . This bell is one of 53 full @-@ sized replicas made in France and donated by the United States government to each state . Oregon received its copy on July 4 , 1950 . Throughout the grounds are native trees and shrubs , including blue spruce , Oregon @-@ grape ( the state flower ) , giant sequoia , coast redwood , Japanese maple , dogwood species , Bradford pear , cherry tree species , English holly , rhododendron , and magnolia tree species . One Douglas @-@ fir tree was grown using a seed that rode aboard Apollo 14 to the Moon in 1971 and was transplanted to the capitol in 1976 from Oregon State University . 
 On the east side of the building is Capitol Park , which includes a bronze equestrian statue by A. Phimister Proctor called The Circuit Rider , statues of John McLoughlin and Jason Lee by Gifford Proctor , and portions of the Corinthian columns of the second capitol building . Lee established the Methodist Mission and what would become Willamette University . McLoughlin , of the Hudson 's Bay Company , was proclaimed the Father of Oregon . The Circuit Rider was added in 1924 as a monument to early preachers . During the Columbus Day Storm in 1962 , this statue was knocked over and damaged but restored in 1963 . There is also a memorial to Oregon 's recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor . This memorial , dedicated on September 18 , 2004 , has 13 pillars of granite and includes bronze plaques with images and medal citations for each recipient . 
 To the west of the building is Willson Park , named for Salem founder William H. Willson and sited roughly at the center of his former landholdings . From 1853 to 1965 it was a Salem city park . After the park was turned over to the state , Lloyd Bond and Associates were asked to redesign the park . Willson Park has the Waite Fountain , a gazebo built in 1982 , and a Parade of Animals sculpture , designed as a play structure and added in 1991 . Waite Fountain was donated in honor of Oregon businessperson E. M. Waite in 1907 by his wife . The Breyman Brothers Fountain , added in 1904 as a memorial to Werner and Eugene Breyman , is at the far west end of the park . It was originally decorated with a statue of a soldier from the Spanish – American War and also served as a lamp post and horse trough . Today the statue holds no water and is sometimes planted with flowers . In 2005 , a Walk of Flags feature was added that displays the flags of every state in the Union . In 2009 , the nine flags of Oregon 's federally recognized Native American tribes were added to the Walk of Flags . 
 Other features on the capitol grounds include Sprague Fountain and the Wall of Water . The Wall of Water is located across Court Street from the main entrance . It was added in 1990 and has 22 nozzles shooting water 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) into the air in a plaza that also has slabs of stone with information about Oregon 's history . Added in 1985 , the Capitol Beaver family represents the state animal . Additional features of the grounds include a peace pole donated by the Society of Prayer for World Peace , a large boulder that once lay along the Oregon Trail , a planter that spells out " Oregon " using shrubs , and a rose garden maintained by the Salem Rose Society . 
 = 2008 Chino Hills earthquake = 
 The 2008 Chino Hills earthquake occurred at 11 : 42 : 15 a.m. PDT on July 29 in Southern California . The epicenter of the magnitude 5 @.@ 5 earthquake was in Chino Hills , approximately 28 miles ( 45 km ) east @-@ southeast of downtown Los Angeles . Though no lives were lost , eight people were injured , and it caused considerable damage in numerous structures throughout the area and caused some amusement park facilities to shut down their rides . The earthquake led to increased discussion regarding the possibility of a stronger earthquake in the future . 
 = = Earthquake = = 
 The Chino Hills earthquake was caused by oblique @-@ slip faulting , with components of both thrust and sinistral strike @-@ slip displacement . Preliminary reports cited the Whittier fault as the active cause , but the quake was later determined to have been generated by the " Yorba Linda trend , " as identified by Caltech seismologist Egill <unk> . Its epicenter was within 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of Chino Hills and its hypocenter was approximately 9 @.@ 1 miles ( 14 @.@ 6 km ) deep . Initial estimations of the moderate main shock reported it as magnitude 5 @.@ 8 , but this was later revised to magnitude 5 @.@ 4 and in later months to a 5 @.@ 5 . The main shock was reportedly felt as far south as San Diego , and Tijuana , Mexico , and as far east as Las Vegas , Nevada . It was the strongest earthquake to occur in the greater Los Angeles area since the 1994 Northridge earthquake . 
 As reported by The Orange County Register , three <unk> , all less than magnitude 3 @.@ 0 , occurred in Anaheim Hills , 7 miles ( 11 km ) southwest of Chino Hills , two months before the Chino Hills earthquake . There was an unusually low amount of seismic activity in Southern California in the week prior to the quake . Between July 20 and July 26 , 2008 , there were no earthquakes in Southern California exceeding magnitude 3 @.@ 0 , thus there was speculation that the wane in seismic activity was a precursor to a possible larger event . 
 = = = Impact = = = 
 The Chino Hills earthquake caused no deaths or significant damage due to the physical location of its epicenter . Most of the infrastructure in the Chino Hills area is relatively new and well suited to withstand a large quake . Unlike previous earthquakes in the region — such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake , which caused serious structural damage and fatalities — this quake caused only minor damage . However , the high volume of telephone use following the shock overloaded provider capacity and disrupted service into the afternoon . 
 Amusement rides at Disneyland , Six Flags Magic Mountain , Universal Studios Hollywood and Knott 's Berry Farm were evacuated and temporarily shut down . California State University , Fullerton suffered some damage in its older , inadequately engineered buildings . In Orange , the Chapman University School of Law was evacuated after a water pipe was ruptured . Pipes on a Macy 's department store in Westfield Topanga ruptured during the tremor flooding the store which closed for a couple of days in order to be repaired . A light fixture damaged by the shock started a small fire in the Westfield <unk> Mall in Santa Ana ; since the fire was in an empty movie theater , nobody was harmed . 
 A gap was reported on California State Route 91 near Anaheim Hills , approximately 7 miles ( 11 km ) southwest of the epicenter , but the California Department of Transportation concluded that the gap did not pose a danger . A minor landslide near the freeway caused some traffic congestion , but structural damage were reported . Caltrans replaced an expansion joint on an Interstate 5 truck overpass at the El Toro Y Interchange . The roof of Placentia 's public library nearly collapsed ; afterwards , the building was closed for repairs . 
 Electrical outages were reported in Chino , Chino Hills , Diamond Bar and Pomona . Over 2 @,@ 000 people lost power after a fire broke out at a La Habra power station , but electricity was restored that afternoon . Los Angeles International Airport reported a ground radar system outage along with a broken water heater , causing flooding in the checked luggage preparation area of Terminal 7 . Minor injuries from falling ceiling tiles were reported at a medical clinic in Brea . 
 = = = Aftershocks = = = 
 Approximately 100 minor aftershocks and one presumed foreshock were reported within two days after the earthquake , 27 of which occurred within an hour after the earthquake . Four aftershocks of at least 3 @.@ 0 in magnitude were reported — the first , nine minutes following the initial earthquake , was the largest at magnitude 3 @.@ 8 ; and two others , occurring over two hours later , were recorded at magnitude 3 @.@ 6 . Twenty @-@ eight aftershocks of at least 2 @.@ 0 were reported . One presumed foreshock , magnitude 1 @.@ 3 , occurred sixteen hours prior to the earthquake in the same location as the main shock . 
 = = = Response = = = 
 There was speculation that the Chino Hills earthquake may have been a foreshock to a larger earthquake . The Southern California Seismic Network 's Aftershock Probability Report , produced minutes after the event , stated that " Most likely , the recent mainshock will be the largest in the sequence . However , there is a small chance , approximately 5 – 10 % , of an earthquake equal to or larger than this mainshock in the next 7 days . " 
 Geologists at the United States Geological Survey and Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast suggest that an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 @.@ 7 or larger will almost definitely occur somewhere in the state within the next 30 years . California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said : " This earthquake reminds us to be prepared . [ ... ] We were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries or property damage . " Additionally , registration for the Great Southern California <unk> , a regional earthquake drill scheduled to occur on Nov. 13 , 2008 , increased significantly in the aftermath of the earthquake . 
 = Flag of Kosovo = 
 The flag of the Republic of Kosovo was adopted by the Assembly of Kosovo immediately following the declaration of independence of the Republic of Kosovo from Serbia on 17 February 2008 . The flag is the result of an international design competition , organised by the United Nations @-@ backed Kosovo Unity Team , which attracted almost one thousand entries . The now @-@ used design is a variant of one proposal designed by <unk> Ibrahimi . It shows six white stars in an arc above a golden map of Kosovo on a blue field . The stars symbolise Kosovo 's six major ethnic groups . 
 Before the declaration of independence , Kosovo was under the administration of the United Nations and used the UN flag for official purposes . The Serbian and Albanian populations had used their own national flags since the Socialist Yugoslavia period . The Serbs use a red , blue and white tricolor , which forms the basis of the current flag of Serbia . The Albanian population have used the flag of Albania since the 1960s as their nationality flag . Both flags can still be seen and used within Kosovo . 
 = = Design and use = = 
 The flag of Kosovo has a blue background , charged with a map of Kosovo and six stars . The stars are officially meant to symbolise Kosovo 's six major ethnic groups : Albanians , Serbs , Turks , <unk> , Romani ( often grouped with the <unk> and Egyptians ) and Bosniaks . Unofficially , the stars are sometimes said to represent the six regions , which according to Albanian ultra nationalist ideology , make up Greater Albania : Albania , Kosovo , western parts of the Republic of Macedonia , parts of northern Greece , parts of Montenegro and Preševo Valley in southern Serbia . The flag of Kosovo resembles that of Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of colors and shapes used ( white stars and yellow shape of the country on a blue field ) . The flag is unusual among national flags in using a map as a design element ; the Flag of Cyprus is the only other to do so . The ratio of the flag was announced during the contest as 2 : 3 , however with the passage of a diplomatic protocol law in Kosovo in April 2009 , the ratio was set as 1 : 1 @.@ 4 ( 5 : 7 when put in whole numbers ) . The colors and construction of the Kosovo flag have not yet been defined ; however , an official government document does give the colors of the flag using CMYK . The unofficial RGB values of the flag have been manually extracted since 2009 . The use of the Kosovo flag is regulated by the law : " Law on the Use of Kosovo State Symbols " . However , the Serbian Government objects to the use of the Kosovo flag at international meetings and gatherings .

 Even months after Kosovo 's declaration of independence , the Serbian flag was still seen at official government buildings until officially replaced by the Kosovo Government . Serbian flags were used in global protests against Kosovo independence and still can be seen in Serb @-@ majority areas in the north . However , a person was sentenced by a panel of <unk> judges on November 19 , 2009 , for inciting hatred by raising a Serbian flag on a mosque in the southern part of Mitrovica ( among other charges of discord / intolerance and attempted aggravated murder of a police officer ) . 
 = = Before independence = = 
 Until 2008 , Kosovo did not have a flag of its own . However , during different periods of history , different flags were flown in Kosovo . Before 1969 , the only flags that could legally fly over Kosovo ( then an autonomous province ) were those of SFR Yugoslavia and SR Serbia . If a nationalist flag were flown , such as Albanian , Serbian or Croatian , a person could go to prison for doing it . In 1969 , the Kosovar Albanian population was able to use the Albanian flag as its national flag . However , the flag had to be charged with a red star , since this was a common symbol of the Yugoslav nation . Even without this requirement , the flag of the People 's Socialist Republic of Albania at the time had a red star , outlined in gold , above the double headed eagle . Later on , different nationalities in Kosovo could use their own national flags in accordance with legislation . Before the death of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito and the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia , there were calls for the Albanian flag to be banned because residents in Kosovo did not want to live under a foreign flag . This sentiment culminated in the " Petition of the 2016 " , which called for , among other items , a greater statehood status for Serbia and the removal of all Albanian symbols . The Serbian side also began to remove the red star from the Yugoslav flag , using it for protests to counterbalance the Albanian population and to promote a " Greater Serbia " . 
 When Kosovo was under the administration of the United Nations , the UN flag was flown in Kosovo . However , the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was the Albanian flag . The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings , even though it was against UN regulations . Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags , like those of cities , could fly on public buildings . If the Albanian flag did have to go up , then the Serbian flag must go up too , according to UN regulations . However , this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever @-@ present in Kosovo during the <unk> period . 
 = = Competition for a new flag = = 
 A competition for a new flag , held in June 2007 , received 993 entries . Under the terms of UN talks , all such symbols would have to reflect the multi @-@ ethnic nature of Kosovo , avoiding the use of the Albanian or Serbian double @-@ headed eagles or the use of solely red and black or red , blue and white color schemes . Red and black are the colours used on the Albanian flag ; red , blue and white are the main colours used on the Serbian flag . Additionally , all entries had to be rectangular and have a 2 : 3 proportion . The Kosovo Symbols Commission eventually selected three designs , which were then voted on by the Assembly of Kosovo ( with a two @-@ thirds majority required for approval ) , when independence was declared after the status talks . The three proposals selected were forwarded to the Assembly on 4 February 2008 .

 Ibrahim Rugova , the first president of Kosovo , introduced the " flag of Dardania " on October 29 , 2000 . The flag was blue , inscribed with a red disc with a golden ring . Inside the red disc is the Albanian eagle . The eagle is holding a ribbon with the legend " Dardania " inscribed . Dardania is the name of an ancient region in the same general area as Kosovo , but is not officially recognised by any international power . This flag did not gain much popularity , but was occasionally used at cultural and sports events during the <unk> period and was also used at Rugova 's funeral to cover his coffin . It is still used as an unofficial presidential standard and by the two <unk> political parties , the Democratic League of Kosovo and the Democratic League of Dardania . 
 Prior to the declaration of independence , Kosovars displayed a flag featuring a map of Kosovo against a blue and yellow background , similar to the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina . 
 = Ten Freedom Summers = 
 Ten Freedom Summers is a four @-@ disc box set by American trumpeter and composer Wadada Leo Smith , released on May 5 , 2012 , by <unk> Records . Smith wrote its pieces intermittently for 34 years , beginning in 1977 , before performing them live in November 2011 at the Colburn School 's Zipper Hall in Los Angeles . He was accompanied by the nine @-@ piece Southwest Chamber Music ensemble and his own jazz quartet , featuring drummers <unk> <unk> and Susie Ibarra , pianist Anthony Davis , and bassist John Lindberg . 
 A free jazz and contemporary classical work , Ten Freedom Summers comprises 19 pieces that are mostly fully developed suites . They eschew conventional themes for abstract expressions of the subject matter , which focuses on the Civil Rights Movement and other interrelated topics . Smith cites the segregation of his native Mississippi and playwright August Wilson 's The Pittsburgh Cycle as inspirations behind the work . Ten Freedom Summers received widespread critical acclaim and was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2013 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Smith started Ten Freedom Summers in 1977 , when he wrote the piece " Medgar Evers " as an evocation of the eponymous civil rights activist gunned down in Mississippi in 1963 . Smith subsequently worked intermittently on the project . He spent 34 years writing it , supported by a series of residencies , grants and commissions , the final one from the Southwest Chamber Music ensemble . He completed the pieces in a flurry of activity between 2009 and 2011 . Smith was inspired to assemble the pieces into one group by August Wilson 's 10 @-@ play series The Pittsburgh Cycle . Smith has also said of the idea behind Ten Freedom Summers : 
 " I was born in 1941 and grew up in segregated Mississippi and experienced the conditions which made it imperative for an activist movement for equality . I saw that stuff happening . Those are the moments that triggered this . It was in that same environment that I had my first dreams of becoming a composer and performer . " 
 Ten Freedom Summers was recorded at Zipper Hall in Los Angeles , where Smith performed live for three nights from November 4 to November 6 , 2011 . He played 19 pieces , accompanied by either his Golden Quartet , the nine @-@ piece Southwest Chamber Music ensemble conducted by Jeff von der Schmidt , or both . Smith 's quartet featured drummers <unk> <unk> and Susie Ibarra , pianist Anthony Davis , and bassist John Lindberg .

 Ten Freedom Summers comprises four discs for a total of four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours of music . Most of its 19 pieces were fully developed suites , with three spanning over 20 minutes . According to Smith , there were no recurring motifs throughout . Instead of using his own " <unk> " method of graphic notation , Smith wrote Ten Freedom Summers with a traditionally notated score . His Golden Quartet played music rooted in blues and jazz idioms , and the Southwest Chamber Music ensemble played violin , viola , cello , harp , concert bass , glockenspiel , bass clarinet , flute , tympani , marimba , gongs , and other miscellaneous percussion . In the opinion of All About Jazz writer Mark <unk> , Smith 's use of echo @-@ laden , atmospheric sounds in his previous work culminated on Ten Freedom Summers , whose somber mood reflected the pieces ' titles . 
 The compositions were organized in three principal sections — " Defining Moments in America " , " What Is Democracy ? " , and " Freedom Summers " . Each section 's pieces musically described significant figures associated with the African @-@ American Civil Rights Movement during 1954 to 1964 and concepts relevant to the formation of institutions that evolved from human interaction , including government , media , and megacorporations . Jeff Dayton @-@ Johnson from All About Jazz said although its movements " variously address Malcolm X , Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . , Brown vs. Board of Education , Medgar Evers [ and ] the Little Rock Nine " , the " thematic concerns nevertheless extend ... both backwards ( to the 1857 Dred Scott case ) and forward ( to 9 / 11 ) , and to a series of cross @-@ cutting concerns ( e.g. , democracy , the freedom of the press and the black church ) . " 
 According to Josh Langhoff from PopMatters , the box set 's pieces " transform their subjects into musical invention and moods ; they ’ re not literal or programmatic . " Langhoff finds them similar to contemporary classical pieces in how they " make their points through abstraction . " Daniel Spicer of BBC Music characterized the music as " a mixture of austere contemporary classical composition performed by the LA @-@ based Southwest Chamber Music ensemble , and turbulent free jazz improvised by the Golden Quartet " . In the opinion of jazz critic John Fordham , the presence of either Smith 's jazz quartet or the classical ensemble led him to abandon typical themes and continuous pulses in favor of free jazz and contemporary classical idioms . Bob Rusch believed the performances were not inspired by contemporary Civil Rights Movement music by artists such as Paul Robeson , Pete Seeger , Mahalia Jackson , or Aretha Franklin , because Smith 's Golden Quintet exhibited an astral , chamber sound .

 Ten Freedom Summers received widespread acclaim from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received a weighted average score of 99 , based on 8 reviews . In The Guardian , Fordham called it " a landmark in jazz 's rich canon " , while Bill Shoemaker of The Wire deemed it " a monumental evocation of America 's civil rights movement " . Glen Hall of Exclaim ! wrote that " Smith 's music resonates with the suffering and the dreams of a better life that embodied the decade of 1954 to 1964 that is the subject of this powerful compendium of compositions . " AllMusic 's Thom Jurek viewed the box set as Smith 's best work , writing that it " belongs in jazz 's canonical lexicon with Duke Ellington 's Black Brown & Beige and Max Roach 's Freedom Now Suite . " Phil Johnson from The Independent found the music very gratifying , comparing it to if Miles Davis had recorded Ligeti during the 1950s . Langhoff wrote in PopMatters that the set was " about sound : the tangible , physically beautiful sounds of Smith 's imperative trumpet and of different instruments in combination , testing their own limits . " He asserted in conclusion , " In four and a half hours , Wadada Leo Smith writes one of America 's defining events in sound , and the story is all of ours . " In Cadence Magazine , Rusch was less enthusiastic and felt the box set could have benefitted from being released as four separate albums , writing that listening to the record in its entirety was " exhausting , but also involving and inspiring " . 
 Ten Freedom Summers was ranked as one of the best jazz albums of 2012 by AllMusic , All About Jazz , JazzTimes , and the Chicago Reader . Bret Saunders from The Denver Post named it 2012 's best jazz record , and Down Beat magazine named it their album of the year . It was also ranked number 31 in The Wire 's list of 2012 's best albums . Ten Freedom Summers was one of three finalists for the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Music , along with Aaron Jay <unk> 's classical composition " Pieces of Winter Sky " and " Partita for 8 Voices " by Caroline Shaw , who ultimately won the award .

 The 1984 Independence Bowl was a post @-@ season American college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Air Force Falcons at Independence Stadium in Shreveport , Louisiana on December 15 , 1984 . The game was the final contest of the 1984 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season for both teams , and ended in a 23 – 7 victory for the Air Force Academy . 
 The Virginia Tech Hokies earned a bid to the Independence Bowl following an 8 – 3 record during the 1984 @-@ 1985 football season . Tech was the No. 3 team in the country in terms of overall defense and No. 2 in terms of rushing defense , due to the efforts of Tech defender Bruce Smith , an All @-@ American and Outland Trophy winner who would later go on to be the first @-@ overall selection in the 1985 NFL Draft . Smith became the centerpiece of an eligibility debate during the weeks prior to the game , as he was at first prohibited from participating in the game by the NCAA , which had placed him under probation for accepting illegal gifts . Smith contested this probation in Virginia and Louisiana courts , and was allowed to play in the game by virtue of two court actions . 
 Facing the Hokies were the Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy , who had gone 7 – 4 during the regular season , including a 5 – 3 record in the Western Athletic Conference . The Falcons were led by first @-@ year head coach Fisher DeBerry and had the No. 1 ranked rushing offense in the country , using their wishbone offense to great effect . 
 The game kicked off under comfortable temperatures and moderate wind . An estimated 41 @,@ 100 people came out to watch the Falcons take on the Hokies . Air Force scored first with a 35 @-@ yard field goal , but the Hokies struck back with a touchdown off a 10 @-@ play , 72 @-@ yard drive , putting Virginia Tech ahead 7 – 3 . That score would remain until halfway through the second quarter , when Virginia Tech fumbled the ball at its own three @-@ yard line . Air Force recovered the ball and scored a touchdown on the next play , regaining a 10 – 7 lead . After halftime , Virginia Tech 's defense began to break down under Air Force 's rushing offense . The Hokies and Air Force battled defensively throughout the third quarter , but in the fourth quarter , Air Force 's offense broke free for 13 unanswered points , clinching the victory . Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss was named the game 's most valuable player on offense , while Virginia Tech linebacker Vince Daniels was named the game 's most valuable player on defense .

 The United States Air Force Academy Falcons began the 1984 college football season with a new head coach , Fisher DeBerry , who replaced the successful Ken Hatfield . Hatfield and the Falcons had gone 10 – 2 during 1983 , including a win in the 1983 Independence Bowl . Following that win , Hatfield accepted the head @-@ coaching position at the University of Arkansas and DeBerry was hired to replace him , being promoted from the offensive coordinator position . 
 In the first two games of his Air Force career , DeBerry 's Falcons jumped to an excellent start . In the team 's 1984 opener , the Falcons defeated San Diego State , 34 – 17 . The following week , the Falcons blew out Northern Colorado , 75 – 7 . But after those two victories , things became more difficult for the Falcons . Air Force lost its next two games ( at Utah and Wyoming ) before defeating Colorado State , Navy , and traditional football powerhouse Notre Dame . 
 The Falcons ' final four games were split evenly — two wins , two losses — and Air Force finished the regular season with a record of 7 – 4 and a Western Athletic Conference record of 4 – 3 . In late November , in exchange for their regular @-@ season success , the Falcons were invited to participate in the Independence Bowl , becoming the second team in the nine @-@ year history of the game to be invited in two consecutive years .

 Virginia Tech began the 1984 season under head coach Bill Dooley , who at the time was the winningest coach in Tech history . In 1983 , the Hokies had gone 9 – 2 , with one of the two losses coming at the hands of No. 9 West Virginia in a nationally televised game . Tech began the 1984 season with a win against Wake Forest , but followed that by a loss against West Virginia in one of the most contentious college football rivalries in the country at that time . In the two weeks that followed , Tech continued to alternate wins and losses , reaching an overall record of 2 – 2 by the end of the fourth week of the season . Tech 's fortunes took a turn for the better during the latter portion of the season , however , as the Hokies proceeded to win six of their final seven games before earning a bid to the 1984 Independence Bowl . 
 = = Pregame buildup = = 
 In the weeks leading up to the Independence Bowl , the game received as much or more coverage than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith , who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game . Spread bettors favored Air Force to win the game by four points . Ticket sales were slow in the weeks leading up to the bowl , and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12 @,@ 000 tickets . Tech representatives said they might have to return as many as 8 @,@ 000 tickets due to the difficulty of selling tickets for a game more than 20 hours away by car .

 During the 1984 season , Virginia Tech 's rushing offense was led by running back Maurice Williams , who had 149 carries for 574 yards and six touchdowns during the regular season . At quarterback , the Hokies featured Mark Cox , who completed 86 passes for 983 yards , five touchdowns , and eight interceptions during the season . Cox 's favorite target was tight end Joe Jones , who caught 39 passes for 452 yards and one touchdown during the season . 
 On the other side of the field , Air Force had the No. 2 rushing offense in the country during the 1984 regular season . Air Force fullback Pat Evans led the team with 159 carries for 1 @,@ 015 rushing yards . Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss also was known more for his running than his passing . Weiss finished the regular season with just 41 completions for 668 yards and three touchdowns . He carried the ball 126 times for 540 yards and 10 touchdowns . Wide receiver Ken Carpenter benefited the most from the few passes that were thrown . He had 15 catches for 258 yards and two touchdowns during the regular season .

 On defense , the Falcons were led by Terry Maki , who had a total of 137 tackles , including assists . Dwan Wilson had five interceptions for the Falcons , and safety Scott Thomas had four . Altogether , the Falcons allowed an average of 148 rushing yards and 167 passing yards per game . In scoring defense , the Falcons allowed an average of just 21 points per game while averaging 44 points per game themselves . 
 Virginia Tech 's defense , meanwhile , was No. 2 nationally in rushing defense and No. 3 in total defense . During the 11 games of the regular season , Tech allowed an average of just 3 @.@ 34 yards per play , the second @-@ lowest total allowed in Tech football history . The most important player on that defense was Tech lineman Bruce Smith , who accumulated 52 tackles and 16 sacks during the regular season . On December 6 , Smith received the Outland Trophy , an award given to the top interior defensive lineman as voted by American sportswriters . Among defensive backs , the Hokies were led by Ashley Lee , who caught seven interceptions during the season . 
 = = = Bruce Smith controversy = = = 
 In the spring of 1983 , Virginia Tech was placed on probation by the NCAA for violations stemming from illegal benefits given to players and potential recruits . The probation 's main effect was to ban the players who received the benefits from participating in any postseason game following the 1984 season . Seven of the eight players involved in the scandal either left Virginia Tech or had the probation lifted as a result of appeals to the NCAA . The eighth , Bruce Smith , did not . 
 Because the names of the eight players had been kept secret , the general public was not informed that Bruce Smith , who had developed into one of the best defensive players in the country , would not be able to participate in the 1984 Independence Bowl . Only when Smith filed suit to force Virginia Tech and the NCAA to allow him to play in the game was the situation revealed . Dr. Cecil Lloyd , chairman of the Independence Bowl , announced at the time of the lawsuit that had he known about the restrictions on Smith , he likely would not have invited Tech to play in the game . 
 Smith nevertheless obtained an injunction from a Virginia court to allow him to participate in the game , which was being held in Louisiana . In response , the NCAA threatened to remove the Independence Bowl 's certification if Smith was allowed to play . When the bowl forbade Smith from participating , he obtained a restraining order from a Louisiana court to force the Independence Bowl to allow him to play . On the day of the game , the NCAA attempted to appeal the decision to the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeals , but a three @-@ judge panel denied the appeal . By this time , the game was about to begin , and Smith was allowed to play .

 The 1984 Independence Bowl kicked off on December 15 , 1984 in Shreveport , Louisiana . The game was televised in the United States on ESPN , and Howard David , Paul Maguire , and Steve Grad were the broadcasters . Weather at kickoff was a comfortable 74 ° F ( 23 ° C ) and the wind was from the southwest at approximately 15 miles per hour ( 24 km / h ) . More than 41 @,@ 000 tickets were sold for the game , but attendance was somewhat less , as many seats were empty . 
 = = = First quarter = = = 
 Virginia Tech kicked off to begin the game , and Air Force began the first drive of the game at its 20 @-@ yard line after a touchback . The Falcons began the game with three consecutive short rushes that failed to gain a first down and punted the ball away to Virginia Tech . The Hokies began their first drive of the game after a short return to their 35 @-@ yard line . As had Air Force before them , Tech was unable to gain a first down and punted . Air Force began its second drive at its 34 @-@ yard line and had more success on its second drive . Aided by an offside penalty against Virginia Tech , the Falcons picked up a first down with a big run by Bart Weiss that penetrated the Tech side of the field . That run was followed by several others from the Falcons , who drove inside the Tech red zone before being stopped by the Tech defense . Facing fourth down , Air Force attempted a 35 @-@ yard field goal , which was successful . With 6 : 35 remaining in the first quarter , Air Force took a 3 – 0 lead . 
 Following Air Force 's post @-@ score kickoff and a short return by the Hokies , Virginia Tech 's offense began a drive at its 28 @-@ yard line . A five @-@ yard false @-@ start penalty pushed the Tech offense back five yards , but a long run by quarterback Mark Cox made up the penalty and earned Tech a first down . Another first down followed , and Tech penetrated into the Air Force side of the field . Once there , Eddie Hunter evaded Falcon defenders for a 33 @-@ yard run that took the Hokies inside Air Force 's 20 @-@ yard line . Three more plays pushed Tech forward , inside Air Force 's five @-@ yard line , for a first down . On the next play , Maurice Williams ran forward , into the end zone . The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 7 – 3 lead with 1 : 42 left in the quarter . 
 Air Force returned the Virginia Tech kickoff to its 21 @-@ yard line and was aided by a 15 @-@ yard personal foul penalty against Virginia Tech after the return . The Falcons thus began their drive at their 36 @-@ yard line . They continued moving the ball forward on short rushes , but almost had a severe setback when Weiss fumbled during a carry . He recovered his own drop , however , and the Falcons retained possession . With the Falcons facing fourth down on their half of the field , time ran out in the quarter . At the end of the first quarter , Virginia Tech held a 7 – 3 lead .

 Still facing fourth down , Air Force punted to begin the second quarter . Virginia Tech recovered successfully and began a drive at its 32 @-@ yard line . The Hokies ran the ball successfully at first , gaining a first down and driving into the Falcons ' half of the field . Facing a third down , Tech was aided by a pass interference penalty against Air Force , which have Tech a first down inside the Air Force 25 @-@ yard line . The Hokies advanced to the 20 @-@ yard line , but Cox was sacked by Air Force defender Larry Nicklas , pushing Tech back to the 27 @-@ yard line . Tech head coach Bill Dooley sent in kicker Don Wade to attempt a 43 @-@ yard field goal . The kick fell short , and the margin remained at 7 – 3 with 11 : 03 remaining before halftime . 
 Due to the missed field goal , Air Force took over from the point at which the kick was missed , the 27 @-@ yard line . Despite gaining a bit of momentum when they kept Virginia Tech from scoring , the Falcons were unable to gain a first down and went three and out , punting the ball away . Tech declined to return the ball , which rolled to the Virginia Tech three @-@ yard line , where the Hokies ' offense took over . On the first play after the punt , Tech 's Nigel Bowe fumbled the ball , which was leapt upon by several Air Force defenders , who recovered it . After the fumble recovery , it took the Falcons just one play to score a touchdown and gain a 10 – 7 lead . 
 With 8 : 50 before halftime , Tech now trailed for the first time since the beginning of the quarter . Needing to regain the lead , the Hokies returned Air Force 's kickoff to near the 20 @-@ yard line but committed a 15 @-@ yard personal foul penalty that pushed Tech back to its 12 @-@ yard line and forced the Hokies to gain 22 yards for a first down . Tech was unable to do this due to strong defense from Air Force and punted after going three and out . The kick was short , and Air Force began its drive at its 44 @-@ yard line . The Falcons likewise went three and out and punted back to Tech . 
 The Hokies recovered the punt at their 14 @-@ yard line . The Hokies gained one first down with three rushes , then another on a pass from Cox , advancing the ball to their 35 @-@ yard line . A facemask penalty against Air Force aided Tech as the Hokies drove inside Air Force territory . Time remaining in the half quickly became a factor for Virginia Tech , as the Hokies penetrated the Falcons ' 45 @-@ yard line with just 1 : 10 remaining in the half . As the Hokies rushed the ball , they were forced to call timeouts in order to stop the clock — which counts down following rushing plays that do not gain a first down or end out of bounds . Cox threw occasional passes , gaining short yardage , but most of the Hokies ' work during the drive was done on the ground . Tech penetrated the Air Force red zone , driving to the Falcons ' 12 @-@ yard line with 25 seconds remaining . As Cox attempted to throw a pass into the end zone in an effort to get a touchdown before time expired , Air Force 's Mike Chandler intercepted the ball , denying the Hokies a scoring chance . 
 At halftime , Air Force had a 10 – 7 lead .

 Air Force received the ball to begin the second half and started at its 20 @-@ yard line after a touchback . The Falcons drove into Tech territory , but the Hokies ' defense forced the Falcons to punt near midfield , and Tech took over at 12 : 23 in the quarter at its 24 @-@ yard line after a short return . As had Air Force , Tech picked up a couple of first downs . But like Air Force , the opposition 's defense forced a punt near midfield . Following the punt , Air Force took over at its 20 @-@ yard line with 9 : 09 remaining in the quarter . 
 The Falcons had trouble moving the ball at first , but were helped by a 15 @-@ yard personal foul penalty against Virginia Tech that gave them a first down . Weiss completed a pass that gave the Falcons another first down and drove Air Force inside Tech territory . On the first play within Hokie territory , Weiss fumbled the ball , but fell on it for a loss , and Air Force retained possession . Weiss made up for his fumble two plays later when he scrambled for a first down that kept the drive going . Despite that effort , Tech was able to force a stop and Air Force punted with 3 : 10 remaining in the quarter . 
 Tech took over at its 13 @-@ yard line following the 63 @-@ yard punt but went three and out and was itself forced to punt . Air Force 's offense returned to the field at its 47 @-@ yard line after the kick . The Falcons picked up one first down , but the Tech defense stiffened and forced a fourth down . Needing just inches to gain a first down , Air Force elected to attempt to gain the needed yardage rather than punt the ball away . But before the Falcons could start the play , time ran out in the third quarter . With one quarter remaining , the Falcons still held a 10 – 7 lead . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 The fourth quarter began with Air Force in possession of the ball , facing fourth down , and needing to advance mere inches to gain a first down . During the Falcons ' attempt to gain those inches , however , Tech 's Bruce Smith broke through the Air Force offensive line and sacked Bart Weiss for a loss . Having failed to gain a first down , Air Force turned the ball over to Virginia Tech , which began a drive at its 42 @-@ yard line . Tech 's Eddie Hunter moved the ball forward on three consecutive rushes , earning a first down and driving into Air Force territory . Seeking to tie the game or gain a lead with a trick play ; Tech head coach Bill Dooley ordered a play involving a pass by Hunter instead of quarterback Mark Cox . The pass was intercepted by Air Force defender Scott Thomas , and the Falcons took over on offense at their 38 @-@ yard line with 12 : 58 remaining in the game . 
 As had Virginia Tech , Air Force began moving the ball on the ground . The Falcons were aided by two offsides penalties against the Hokies and drove into Tech territory . Once there , Weiss completed a 16 @-@ yard pass to Tom Coleman for a first down . Weiss picked up another first down by running the ball , pushing the Falcons inside the Tech red zone with 10 : 10 remaining . The Tech defense stiffened , forcing a fourth down at the two @-@ yard line . Rather than kick a field goal , Fisher DeBerry elected to attempt the touchdown , and Mike Brown ran the needed two yards . The score and following extra point gave Air Force a 17 – 7 lead with 6 : 00 remaining in the game . 
 Virginia Tech 's offense began work at its 20 @-@ yard line needing to score quickly in order to have a chance at making up the 10 @-@ point deficit , which would require two separate scores to make good . Mike Cox completed a seven @-@ yard pass , then Maurice Williams broke free for a 15 @-@ yard rush that gave Tech a first down and drove the Hokies to the 42 @-@ yard line . Cox completed a long pass into the Air Force red zone , but the completion was negated by an offensive pass interference penalty against Tech that cost the Hokies the long completion , a loss of down , and an additional 15 yards . While scrambling for extra time in which to throw the ball , Cox was sacked by Air Force defender Chris Funk and fumbled the ball . Air Force recovered the loose football , and the Falcons ' offense returned to the field with just over four minutes left to play . 
 The Falcons began their drive at the Tech 30 @-@ yard line after the fumble , which effectively eliminated any chance Tech had to earn the two scores needed to regain the lead . The Falcons moved the ball effectively down the field , running out the clock as they did so . Bart Weiss finally broke through the Tech defense for a 12 @-@ yard gain and the Falcons ' final touchdown of the game . Though the extra point kick was missed , Air Force had taken an insurmountable 23 – 7 lead with 2 : 08 remaining in the game . Following Air Force 's post @-@ touchdown kickoff , Tech 's offense returned to the field at its 20 @-@ yard line . The first play of the Hokies ' drive resulted in a 10 @-@ yard holding penalty against Tech . With time winding down , Tech advanced the ball successfully via several passes , but time ran out shortly after Tech crossed the 50 @-@ yard line . Air Force clinched a 23 – 7 victory . 
 = = Statistical summary = = 
 The 23 points Tech allowed in the game marked just the third time that season Virginia Tech allowed more than 20 points in a game . For his performance in the game , Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss was named the game 's most valuable player on offense . Virginia Tech linebacker Vince Daniels was named the game 's most valuable defensive player . Daniels had a game @-@ leading 15 tackles , tying a Tech bowl @-@ game record set by Ashley Lee in the 1981 Peach Bowl . The record still stands today . Meanwhile , Weiss completed six of his seven passes for 49 yards . His main success came rushing the ball , as he carried it 29 times for 93 yards and a touchdown . 
 Virginia Tech 's leading rusher was Eddie Hunter , who carried the ball 12 times for 75 yards . Tech quarterback Mark Cox finished the game having completed just six of his 17 passes for 50 passing yards and one interception . In total , Tech turned the ball over four times — twice via interceptions and twice via lost fumbles . 
 Bruce Smith finished the game with a single sack and eight tackles , and cited his poor performance on the time spent away from practice and in court . Other Virginia Tech players cited the court battle as a distraction during game preparations , and it was also thought that many Air Force players were inspired by the increased media coverage given Virginia Tech . Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry said he thought the storm of pre @-@ game publicity about Smith helped his team . " It seemed like everybody forgot the Air Force was in town , " he said . " The thing that motivated the team was the challenge of playing against them with him in the lineup . " 
 Virginia Tech set several bowl game records in the Independence Bowl that still stand today . Tech allowed just two passing first downs , seven pass attempts and 49 passing yards on defense . Conversely , the Hokies allowed 55 rushing attempts by Air Force , a record for the most against Tech in a bowl game . Bart Weiss set a bowl @-@ game record for most carries by a single player against Tech , and Falcons punter Mark Simon kicked a 63 @-@ yard punt that is the longest ever kicked by a Tech opponent in a bowl game .

 Virginia Tech 's loss and Air Force 's win brought both teams to final 1984 records of 8 – 4 . The loss left Virginia Tech winless in five bowl appearances to that date . The win was Air Force 's third bowl victory in as many years , and the Falcons became the first team to repeat as Independence Bowl champions . The Hokies won their next bowl appearance , the 1986 Peach Bowl . Air Force appeared in a bowl the following year , against Texas . 
 Despite the uncomplimentary media coverage given him and his poor performance during the Independence Bowl , Bruce Smith was selected with the first overall pick in the 1985 NFL Draft . Smith was subsequently signed to a $ 2 @.@ 6 million contract by the Buffalo Bills . During the 1985 college football season , Virginia Tech struggled to rebuild from losing 20 starters ( 10 on offense , 10 on defense ) from the 1984 team , and finished with a 6 – 5 record . Air Force , meanwhile , performed extremely well , finishing with an 11 – 1 record , including a bowl @-@ game win over the Texas Longhorns . Fisher DeBerry remained the coach of Air Force for another 22 years , eventually retiring after the conclusion of the 2006 season . 
 Nine years after appearing in the 1984 Independence Bowl , Tech invited to participate in the 1993 game against Indiana . By that time , memories of the legal troubles that had surrounded the game were gone . Independence Bowl president Cecil Lloyd said of the controversy in 1993 , " It was the best thing that ever could have happened to the Independence Bowl . ... It got us international publicity . It put us on the map . "

 The 90th Boat Race took place on 2 April 1938 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . It was the first Boat Race to be televised . In a race umpired by the former Cambridge rower and coach Harold Rickett , Oxford won by two lengths in a time of 20 minutes 30 seconds . The victory took the overall record in the event to 47 – 42 in Cambridge 's favour .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1937 race by three lengths , with Cambridge leading overall with 47 victories to Oxford 's 41 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Cambridge were coached by D. H. E. McCowen ( who had rowed in the 1932 race ) , Derek Mays @-@ Smith , R. H. H. Symonds ( who had rowed in the 1931 race ) and C. W. Wise . Oxford 's coaches were P. C. Mallam ( a four @-@ time Dark Blue who had rowed in the 1921 , 1922 , 1923 and 1924 races ) , Guy Oliver Nickalls ( who had rowed three times between 1921 and 1923 ) and J. H. Page . The umpire for the race wast the former Cambridge rower Harold Rickett who had rowed for the Light Blues three times , in the 1930 , 1931 and 1932 races . He had also coached them for the 1933 race , and had umpired the race the previous year . 
 Oxford had been rated as favourites to win the race throughout their three months of training . The rowing correspondent for The Times noted that " both crews are absolutely first @-@ rate exponents of their respective styles " and that " both coxes are first @-@ rate " . Oxford elected to use the same boat as they raced in for the previous year 's event , while Cambridge used a new vessel ; both were built by George Sims Boatbuilding Company of Hammersmith . It was the first year that the Boat Race was televised , which , according to the television correspondent for The Observer , " was a great success " and " not even the umpire knew more about the race than we [ the viewers ] " .

 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 13 @.@ 75 lb ( 82 @.@ 2 kg ) , 7 @.@ 25 pounds ( 3 @.@ 3 kg ) per rower more than their opponents .

Oxford saw five former Blues return to the crew , including John Cherry who was making his third consecutive appearance in the event . Two of the participants were registered as non @-@ British , both in the Cambridge crew : number six G. Keppel and cox T. H. Hunter were both American .

Despite being out @-@ rated by three strokes per minute , Oxford took an immediate lead and were over half a length ahead by the time they passed Fulham Wall . With the Middlesex bend in their favour , Oxford increased their lead to a length and a half ahead by the Mile Post . Cambridge 's stroke Eadie called for a push just before Harrods Furniture Depository and the Light Blues began to reduce the deficit , and although the Dark Blues responded , by the time the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge , Oxford 's lead was down to half a length . 
 Cambridge 's faster stroke rate saw them gain on the Dark Blues and by the time the passed HMS Stork , they held a quarter @-@ length lead , although by Chiswick Steps the lead was gone and Oxford led by a quarter of a length . They passed below Barnes Bridge with that lead as both crews headed into rough water . According to the special correspondent writing in the The Manchester Guardian , " a sea awaited them " . Both crews took on water in the difficult conditions but the Dark Blues prevailed . Oxford won by two lengths in a time of 20 minutes 30 seconds , their second consecutive win . It was the narrowest margin of victory since the 1930 race and the fastest since the 1935 race . The victory took the overall record in the event to 47 – 42 in Cambridge 's favour . The correspondent for The Manchester Guardian described it as " excellent " , and " a great race in the best traditions " The Observer 's correspondent suggested that " the race will rank as one of the closest and most exciting in which the two Universities have ever engaged . " The former Oxford rower , G. I. F. Thomson , writing in The Observer , claimed " one can scarcely have hoped for a more interesting or thrilling race " . Oxford 's number seven and boat club president Cherry said " I hope this will show that last year 's victory was not a flash in the pan " . His counterpart , T. B. Langton noted that his crew " had an excellent race and enjoyed every minute of it " . 
 = Hurricane Esther = 
 Hurricane Esther was the first large tropical cyclone to be discovered by satellite imagery . The fifth tropical cyclone , named storm , and hurricane of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season , Esther developed from an area of disturbed weather hundreds of miles west @-@ southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands on September 10 . Moving northwestward , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Esther on September 11 , before reaching hurricane intensity on the following day . Early on September 13 , Esther curved westward and deepened into a major hurricane . The storm remained a Category 3 hurricane for about four days and gradually moved in west @-@ northwestward direction . Late on September 17 , Esther strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane and peaked with sustained winds of 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) on September 18 . The storm curved north @-@ northeastward on September 19 , while offshore North Carolina . Esther began to weaken while approaching New England and fell to Category 3 intensity on September 21 . The storm turned eastward early on the following day , and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm . 
 Esther then executed a large cyclonic loop , until curving northward on September 25 . Early on the following day , Esther struck Cape Cod , hours before emerging into the Gulf of Maine . Later on September 26 , the storm made landfall in southeastern Maine , before weakening to a tropical depression and becoming extratropical over southeastern Quebec . The remnants persisted for about 12 hours , before dissipating early on September 27 . Between North Carolina and New Jersey , effects were primarily limited to strong winds and minor beach erosion and coastal flooding due to storm surge . In New York , strong winds led to severe crop losses and over 300 @,@ 000 power outages . High tides caused coastal flooding and damage to a number of pleasure boats . Similar impact was reported in Massachusetts . Additionally , some areas observed more than 8 inches ( 203 mm ) of rainfall , flooding basements , low @-@ lying roads , and underpasses . Overall , damage was minor , totaling about $ 6 million ( 1961 USD ) . There were also seven deaths reported when a United States Navy P5M aircraft crashed about 120 miles ( 190 km ) north of Bermuda . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 10 , the Television Infrared Observation Satellite observed an area of convection , or thunderstorms , to the southwest of the Cape Verde islands , suggesting the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis . At 18 : 00 UTC that day , a tropical depression formed and subsequently moved on a northwest trajectory . By the time the Hurricane Hunters reached the system on September 12 , winds of hurricane force were recorded , and as such , the San Juan , Puerto Rico Weather Bureau began issuing warnings on Hurricane Esther . It was later estimated that the system attained tropical storm status on September 11 , although the National Hurricane Center later noted that it could have attained hurricane status by this date , thus potentially being one of four simultaneous hurricanes , along with hurricanes Betsy , Carla , and Debbie . The only other such occasions were in 1893 and 1998 . This also made Esther the first hurricane to be discovered by satellite imagery , although not the first to be imaged by one . 
 After becoming a hurricane , Esther turned more to the west @-@ northwest , influenced by the strengthening Bermuda High that built behind Hurricane Debbie well to the north . By September 13 , the storm attained major hurricane status , which is a Category 3 on the current @-@ day Saffir @-@ Simpson scale with sustained winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . By that time , the gale force winds extended about 230 mi ( 370 km ) from the center , with hurricane @-@ force winds spreading 135 mi ( 217 km ) to the north . After maintaining winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) for about two days , Esther weakened slightly on September 16 while passing well north of the Lesser Antilles . On the next day , the hurricane passed about 375 mi ( 604 km ) north of Puerto Rico . Late on September 17 , the barometric pressure fell to 927 mbar ( 92 @.@ 7 kPa ; 27 @.@ 4 inHg ) in the center of Esther , and operationally the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of 150 mph ( 241 km / h ) . This was later lowered slightly to 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) , which would be its peak intensity attained on September 18 , making it a Category 4 hurricane . 
 Around the time of attaining peak winds , Esther began moving more to the northwest toward the east coast of the United States , influenced by a dissipating cold front that exited the coast on September 15 . On September 20 , the hurricane passed about 120 mi ( 193 km ) east of Cape Hatteras while turning to the north @-@ northeast . It continued up the coastline , later passing about 150 mi ( 241 km ) east of the Delmarva Peninsula . Another trough from the west steered Esther to the northeast and was expected to cause the storm to accelerate , potentially bringing it over Cape Cod . While turning , the hurricane passed about 110 mi ( 177 km ) south of the eastern tip of Long Island , 35 mi ( 56 km ) southeast of Block Island , and just 27 mi ( 43 km ) south of Nantucket Island . After the trough bypassed the hurricane , Esther slowed and turned to the east away from land and over much cooler waters . It quickly weakened to tropical storm status on September 22 , and on that day the Weather Bureau discontinued advisories , remarking that Esther no longer had tropical characteristics . 
 As a weakened tropical storm , Esther turned to the southeast and gradually executed a large loop . On September 24 , it turned back to the west and subsequently turned back to the north , influenced by another approaching trough . Warmer waters allowed the storm to re @-@ intensify slightly . As a result , the Boston Weather Bureau reissued advisories on the storm on September 25 while Esther was 275 mi ( 443 km ) south of Nantucket . The storm crossed over eastern Cape Cod while gradually weakening , making a final landfall near Rockland , Maine , on September 26 . After crossing into Canada , Esther became extratropical early on September 27 while continuing to the east @-@ northeast . It was last noted at 06 : 00 UTC that day while over eastern Quebec . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 While Esther was becoming a powerful hurricane over the open Atlantic , the San Juan Weather Bureau office issued a small craft advisory for the Leeward Islands , United States Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico , Hispaniola , the Bahamas , and Bermuda . Because of uncertainty about the storm 's future path , the Weather Bureau advised residents along the east coast of the United States to closely follow the storm . The agency later issued a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach , South Carolina to Norfolk , Virginia on September 18 . 
 In Norfolk , Virginia , between 10 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 people were evacuated to emergency shelters on September 19 , but were able to return home the next day as Esther passed far to the east . Preparations for Esther were described by the National Weather Service 's Norfolk bureau as " the most thorough ever seen here " at the time . Naval ships and aircraft carriers based in the city headed for open waters to endure the storm , while over 200 military airplanes were flown inland away from the coast . 
 The National Weather Service , in anticipation of a possible landfall in the Carolinas , issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach , South Carolina to Norfolk , Virginia on September 18 ( tropical storm warnings were not issued at the time ) . A hurricane warning was issued from Cherry Point , North Carolina to the Virginia capes on September 19 , but was discontinued early on September 20 as the hurricane passed to the east . A hurricane watch was also issued from Cape May , New Jersey to the Massachusetts coast on September 19 , and like the warning , was discontinued on September 20 . 
 As Esther began to parallel the coastline , a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas from Long Island to Provincetown , Massachusetts on September 20 , and were extended to Eastport , Maine early on September 21 . All hurricane watches were discontinued on September 21 as Esther moved away from the New England coast , and all hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings later that day as Esther passed near Nantucket and weakened to a tropical storm , and all warnings were discontinued on September 22 after the storm moved away from the coast . After Esther completed its anticyclonic loop over the northwestern Atlantic , a gale warning was again issued from Provincetown , Massachusetts to Eastport , Maine on September 25 , and was discontinued the next day after Esther made its second landfall in Maine . Personnel on two offshore surveillance stations called the Texas Towers were evacuated ; a third tower had collapsed during a storm in January 1961 , prompting higher safety standards .

 A powerful hurricane , Esther produced high waves and strong swells across much of the western Atlantic , including along the north coast of Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands , and the Bahamas . 
 = = = North Carolina and Virginia = = = 
 In North Carolina , the outer edges of Esther brought sustained winds of 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) with gusts up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . A storm surge of 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) was reported in Wilmington , North Carolina . The storm surge caused minor flooding and beach erosion in the Outer Banks , where road damage was extensive . Damage to property , however , was minimal , and the storm 's effects in the Wilmington area were compared to those of " a good nor 'easter " by the local weather bureau . Southeastern Virginia experienced tides 2 to 4 ft ( 0 @.@ 6 to 1 @.@ 2 m ) above normal , which flooded some coastal highways in the Hampton Roads area . There was minor beach erosion in the Norfolk area due to turbulent seas . 
 = = = Mid @-@ Atlantic = = = 
 Esther mainly produced heavy rainfall and gale force wind gusts along the coasts of Maryland and Delaware . These areas also experienced storm surges of 6 – 7 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 1 m ) above normal . Wind gusts to 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) were observed at Ocean City , Maryland , and storm surge flooding caused damage to the city 's sea wall and boardwalk . Minor to moderate damage was reported along the New Jersey coast . A wind gust of 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) was observed in Atlantic City . Winds downed trees and power lines and damaged apple crops . Storm surge resulted in minor beach erosion and wrecked some boats . Damage totaled less than $ 1 million . 
 In New York , sustained winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) and gusts up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) in Putnam and Rockland counties downed numerous trees , caused power outages , and damaged crops . Farther south on Long Island , the hardest hit areas were Nassau and eastern Suffolk counties . Wind gusts up to 108 mph ( 174 km / h ) felled trees and power lines , leaving over 300 @,@ 000 homes without electricity ; minor structure damage was also reported . Downed power lines and minor flooding due to rainfall amounts of up to 7 in ( 178 mm ) also caused public transportation delays on Long Island . Tides as high as 35 ft ( 10 @.@ 7 m ) damaged many pleasure boats . Minor flooding was reported in Queens and Brooklyn . Damage likely exceeded $ 3 million , with nearly one @-@ third of that amount incurred to crops and property each . 
 = = = New England = = = 
 In Connecticut , sustained winds between 35 and 50 mph ( 56 and 80 km / h ) and gusts between 45 and 65 mph ( 72 and 105 km / h ) caused electrical and phone service outages , as well as generally minor property damage . There was also some loss to crops , especially apples and corn . Similar impact was reported farther east in Rhode Island , though winds were much stronger , with sustained winds of 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) and a gust up to 83 mph ( 134 km / h ) observed at Block Island . Tides ranging from 4 to 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) above normal damaged small crafts and caused severe beach erosion , destroying a parking lot and washing out several roads . In south @-@ central and northeastern Maine , precipitation totals between 2 and 4 in ( 51 and 102 mm ) flooded basements , underpasses , and low @-@ lying roads , resulting in traffic being delayed by detours . 
 Strong winds were also observed in eastern Massachusetts , with the strongest wind gust being 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) in Chatham . 
 Despite gale and storm force wind gusts in eastern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire , damage was minimal and consisted mainly of downed trees and isolated power outages . Rainfall totals ranged from 1 inch ( 25 mm ) in southern Maine to around 6 inches ( 152 mm ) in the Boston area . The storm separated Smith 's Point from the rest of Nantucket Island , creating what came to be known as Esther 's Island ( which has since re @-@ connected in 1988 , re @-@ separated , and re @-@ connected again in 2009 ) . In all , Esther caused an estimated $ 6 million ( 1961 USD ) in damage . 
 = = = Navy plane crash = = = 
 While over open waters , Esther caused seven indirect deaths when a United States Navy P5M aircraft crashed about 120 miles ( 193 km ) north of Bermuda . A merchant ship , the African Pilot , was in the area where the plane crashed when the captain of the ship received a message from the Bermuda Coast Guard that " We have aircraft in trouble in that vicinity ... " The captain of the African Pilot diverted the ship in order to assist the Coast Guard 's search for the lost plane . The heavy seas brought by Esther made search @-@ and @-@ rescue efforts difficult . In the end , only three of the ten crewmen were rescued ; the other seven were declared lost at sea . 
 The survivors told Coast Guard officials that during the storm , one of the engines of the plane failed , along with most of the electrical power ; as a result , the crew was unable to drop the reserve tank or close the bomb bay doors automatically . Before the crew could close the bomb bay doors manually , the plane crashed in shark @-@ infested waters and broke apart ; three of the crewmen were able to get out of the downed plane , but the other seven were unable to escape . The three survivors were then attacked by sharks before being rescued . 
 = = Project Stormfury = = 
 Hurricane Esther was also one of the first targets of a Navy experiment in modifying or weakening hurricanes by seeding them . On September 16 , a Navy plane flew into the eye of Esther about 400 miles ( 644 km ) northeast of Puerto Rico , and dropped canisters of silver iodide into the storm . The hurricane appeared to weaken slightly in response to the seeding , reportedly by ten percent . This weakening was temporary , however , as the hurricane resumed strengthening shortly after . The aircraft returned the next day to seed again , but the seeding canisters fell outside the eyewall with no effect on its structure , and the hurricane continued to strengthen . Despite this result , the experiment was deemed a success , and led to the establishment of Project Stormfury . 
 = Kubera = 
 Kubera ( Sanskrit : <unk> , Pali / later Sanskrit : Kuvera ) , also spelt Kuber , is the Lord of Wealth and the god @-@ king of the semi @-@ divine Yakshas in Hindu mythology . He is regarded as the regent of the North ( Dik @-@ pala ) , and a protector of the world ( <unk> ) . His many epithets extol him as the overlord of numerous semi @-@ divine species and the owner of the treasures of the world . Kubera is often depicted with a plump body , adorned with jewels , and carrying a money @-@ pot and a club . 
 Originally described as the chief of evil spirits in Vedic @-@ era texts , Kubera acquired the status of a Deva ( god ) only in the Puranas and the Hindu epics . The scriptures describe that Kubera once ruled Lanka , but was overthrown by his demon stepbrother Ravana , later settling in the city of Alaka in the Himalayas . Descriptions of the " glory " and " splendours " of Kubera 's city are found in many scriptures . 
 Kubera has also been assimilated into the Buddhist and Jain pantheons . In Buddhism , he is known as Vaisravana , the patronymic used of the Hindu Kubera and is also equated with <unk> , while in Jainism , he is known as <unk> . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 Kubera is often depicted as a dwarf , with fair complexion and a big belly . He is described as having three legs , only eight teeth , one eye , and being adorned with jewels . He is sometimes depicted riding a man . The description of deformities like the broken teeth , three legs , three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts . Kubera holds a mace , a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand . He may also carry a sheaf of jewels or a mongoose with him . In Tibet , the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera 's victory over Nāgas — the guardians of treasures . Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography . 
 In the Vishnudharmottara Purana , Kubera is described as the embodiment of both Artha ( " wealth , prosperity , glory " ) and <unk> , the treatises related to it — and his iconography mirrors it . Kubera 's complexion is described as that of lotus leaves . He rides a man — the state personified , adorned in golden clothes and ornaments , symbolizing his wealth . His left eye is yellow . He wears an armour and a necklace down to his large belly . The Vishnudharmottara Purana further describes his face to be inclined to the left , sporting a beard and mustache , and with two small tusks protruding from the ends of his mouth , representing his powers to punish and to bestow favours . His wife Riddhi , representing the journey of life , is seated on his left lap , with her left hand on the back of Kubera and the right holding a ratna @-@ patra ( jewel @-@ pot ) . Kubera should be four @-@ armed , holding a gada ( mace : symbol of <unk> — administration of justice ) and a shakti ( power ) in his left pair , and standards bearing a lion — representing Artha and a <unk> ( a club , the weapon of Kubera ) . The <unk> treasures Padma and Shankha stand beside him in human form , with their heads emerging from a lotus and a conch respectively . 
 The Agni Purana states that Kubera should be installed in temples as seated on a goat , and with a club in his hand . Kubera 's image is prescribed to be that of gold , with multi @-@ coloured attributes . In some sources , especially in Jain depictions , Kubera is depicted as a drunkard , signified by the " nectar vessel " in his hand . 
 = = Names = = 
 The exact origins of the name Kubera are unknown . " Kubera " or " Kuvera " ( <unk> ) as spelt in later Sanskrit , means " deformed or monstrous " or " ill @-@ shaped one " ; indicating his deformities . Another theory suggests that Kubera may be derived from the verb root <unk> , meaning to conceal . Kuvera is also split as ku ( earth ) , and vira ( hero ) . 
 As the son of Vishrava ( " Fame " ) , Kubera is called Vaisravana ( in the Pali language , <unk> ) and as the son of <unk> , <unk> . Vaisravana is sometimes translated as the " Son of Fame " . The Sutta <unk> commentary says that Vaisravana is derived from a name of Kubera 's kingdom , <unk> . Once , Kubera looked at Shiva and his wife Parvati with jealousy , so he lost one of his eyes . Parvati also turned this deformed eye yellow . So , Kubera gained the name <unk> ( " one who has one yellow eye " ) . He is also called <unk> ( " Lord of spirits " ) like Shiva . Kubera usually is drawn by spirits or men ( nara ) , so is called Nara @-@ vahana , one whose vahana ( mount ) is nara . Hopkins interprets <unk> as being water @-@ spirits , although Mani translates nara as men . Kubera also rides the elephant called <unk> as a loka @-@ pala . His garden is named <unk> . 
 Kubera also enjoys the titles " king of the whole world " , " king of kings " ( Rajaraja ) , " Lord of wealth " ( <unk> ) and " giver of wealth " ( <unk> ) . His titles are sometimes related to his subjects : " king of Yakshas " ( <unk> ) , " Lord of Rakshasas " ( <unk> ) , " Lord of Guhyakas " ( <unk> ) , " king of <unk> " ( <unk> ) , " king of animals resembling men " ( <unk> ) , and " king of men " ( <unk> ) . Kubera is also called <unk> ( " Lord of the hidden " ) . The Atharvaveda calls him the " god of hiding " . 
 = = Changing status and family = = 
 = = = Early descriptions and parentage = = = 
 In the Atharvaveda — where he first appears — and the Shatapatha Brahmana , Kubera is the chief of evil spirits or spirits of darkness , and son of <unk> . The Shatapatha Brahmana calls him the Lord of thieves and criminals . In the Manusmriti , he becomes a respectable Loka @-@ pala ( " world protector " ) and the patron of merchants . In the epic Mahabharata , Kubera is described as the son of Prajapati Pulastya and his wife <unk> and the brother of sage Vishrava . Kubera is described as born from a cow . However , from the Puranas , he is described as the grandson of Pulastya and the son of Vishrava and his wife <unk> ( or <unk> or <unk> ) , daughter of the sage Bharadvaja or <unk> . 
 By this time , though still described as an asura , Kubera is offered prayers at the end of all ritual sacrifices . His titles , such as " best of kings " and " Lord of kings " ( Harivamsa indicate that Kubera is made " Lord of kings " ) , in contrast to the god @-@ king of heaven , Indra , whose title of " best of gods " led to the later belief that Kubera was a man . The early texts Gautama <unk> and <unk> describe him as a man . Only the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> call him a god , and suggest offerings of meat , sesame seeds and flowers to him . 
 = = = Puranic and epic descriptions : Godhood acquired = = = 
 The Puranas and the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana grant Kubera unquestioned godhood . Kubera also acquired the status of the " Lord of riches " and the wealthiest Deva . He also becomes a Loka @-@ pala ( " world protector " ) and guardian ( dik @-@ pala ) of the North direction , although he is also sometimes associated with the East . Kubera 's status as a Loka @-@ pala and a dik @-@ pala is assured in the Ramayana , but in the Mahabharata , some lists do not include Kubera . Thus , Kubera is considered a later addition to the original list of Loka @-@ <unk> , where the gods Agni or Soma appear in his place . This status , the Ramayana records , was granted to Kubera by Brahma — the creator @-@ god and father of Pulastya — as a reward for his severe penance . Brahma also conferred upon Kubera the riches of the world ( <unk> ) , " equality with gods " , and the Pushpaka Vimana , a flying chariot . Kubera then ruled in the golden city of Lanka , identified with modern @-@ day Sri Lanka . The Mahabharata says that Brahma conferred upon Kubera the lordship of wealth , friendship with Shiva , godhood , status as a world @-@ protector , a son called <unk> / Nalakubara , the Pushpaka Vimana and the lordship of the <unk> demons . 
 Both the Puranas and the Ramayana feature the half @-@ blood siblings of Kubera . Vishrava , Kubera 's father , also married the Rakshasa ( demon ) princess <unk> , who mothered four Rakshasa children : Ravana , the chief antagonist of the Ramayana , Kumbhakarna , Vibhishana and <unk> . The Mahabharata regards Vishrava as the brother of Kubera , so Kubera is described as the uncle of Ravana and his siblings . It records that when Kubera approached Brahma for the favour of superseding his father Pulastya , Pulastya created Vishrava . To seek the favour of Vishrava , Kubera sent three women to him , by whom Vishrava begot his demon children . Ravana , after acquiring a boon of Brahma , drove Kubera away from Lanka and seized his Pushpaka Vimana , which was returned to Kubera after Ravana 's death . Kubera then settled on <unk> mountain , near Mount Kailash — the cosmological abode of the god Shiva — in the Himalayas . Sometimes , Kailash itself is called Kubera 's residence . His city is usually called Alaka or Alaka @-@ puri ( " curl @-@ city " ) , but also Prabha ( " splendour " ) , <unk> ( " bejeweled " ) and Vasu @-@ <unk> ( " abode of treasures " ) . There , Kubera had a grove called <unk> , where the leaves were jewels and the fruits were girls of heaven . There is also a charming lake called Nalini in the grove . Kubera is often described as a friend of Shiva in the epics . The Padma Purana says that Kubera prayed to Shiva for many years , and Shiva granted him the kingship of Yakshas . 
 A description of Kubera 's magnificent court appears in the Mahabharata as well as the <unk> . Here , Gandharvas and Apsaras entertain Kubera . Shiva and his wife Parvati often frequent Kubera 's court , which is attended by semi @-@ divine beings like the Vidyadharas ; <unk> ; Rakshasas ; <unk> ; as well as Padma and Shankha ; personified treasures ( <unk> ) ; and <unk> , Kubera 's chief attendant and chief of his army . Like every world @-@ protector , Kubera has seven seers of the North in residence . Alaka is recorded to be plundered by Ravana once , and attacked by the Pandava prince , Bhima once . Kubera 's <unk> army is described to have defeated king <unk> , who then defeated them by the advice of his guru <unk> . Shukra , the preceptor of the demons , is also recorded to have defeated Kubera and stolen his wealth . Another major tale in the scriptures records how Kubera entertained the sage Ashtavakra in his palace . 
 Kubera is the treasurer of the gods and overlord of the semi @-@ divine Yakshas , the Guhyakas , <unk> and Gandharvas , who act as his assistants and protectors of the jewels of the earth , as well as guardians of his city . Kubera is also the guardian of travelers and the giver of wealth to individuals , who please him . The Rakshasas also serve Kubera , however , some cannibalistic Rakshasas are described to have sided with Ravana in the battle against Kubera . Kubera also developed as minor marriage @-@ divinity . He is invoked with Shiva at weddings and is described as <unk> ( " Lord of Kama – pleasure , desire etc . " ) . He is associated with fertility of the aquatic type . 
 The Puranas and the Mahabharata record that Kubera married Bhadra ( " auspicious " ) , or <unk> ( " wife of Kubera " ) , daughter of the demon Mura . She is also called <unk> – a female Yaksha and <unk> ( " splendour " ) . They had three sons : Nalakubara ( " Reed @-@ axle " ) , <unk> ( " <unk> @-@ neck " ) or Varna @-@ <unk> ( " Colourful poet " ) , and <unk> ( " king of animals resembling men " ) ; and a daughter called <unk> ( " fish @-@ eyed " ) . The Mahabharata calls his wife Riddhi ( " prosperity " ) and Nalakubara his son . 
 = = Worship = = 
 As the treasurer of the riches of the world , Kubera is prescribed to be worshipped . Kubera also credited money to the god Venkateshwara ( a form of the god Vishnu ) for his marriage with Padmavati . In remembrance of this , the reason devotees go to Tirupati to donate money in Venkateshwara 's <unk> ( " Donation pot " ) , is so that he can pay it back to Kubera . 
 While Kubera still enjoys prayers as the god of wealth , his role is largely taken by the god of wisdom , fortune and obstacle @-@ removal , Ganesha , with whom he is generally associated . 
 = = Beyond Hinduism = = 
 Kubera is recognized outside India and Hinduism as well . Kubera is a popular figure in Buddhist as well as Jain mythology . The Orientalist Dr. Nagendra Kumar Singh remarked that , " Every Indian religion has a Kubera after the Hindu prototype " . 
 Kubera is the Buddhist Vaisravana or <unk> , and the Japanese Bishamon . The Buddhist Vaisravana , like the Hindu Kubera , is the reagent of the North , a Loka @-@ pala and the Lord of Yakshas . He is one of the Four Heavenly Kings , each associated with a cardinal direction . In Buddhist legends , Kubera is also equated with <unk> , whose wife <unk> is the symbol of abundance . The iconography of Kubera and <unk> is so similar that in certain cases , A. Getty comments , it is extremely difficult to distinguish between <unk> and Kubera . The Japanese Bishamon , also known as Tamon @-@ Ten , is one of the Jūni @-@ Ten ( <unk> ) , a group of 12 Hindu deities adopted in Buddhism as guardian deities ( deva or ten ) who are found in or around Buddhist shrines . The Juni @-@ Ten group of twelve deities were created by adding four deities to the older grouping of <unk> @-@ Ten , the eight guardians of the directions . Bishamon rules over the north , like his Hindu counterpart Kubera . 
 In Jainism , Kubera is the attendant Yaksha of the 19th Tirthankar <unk> . He is usually called <unk> or <unk> , and may be depicted with four faces , rainbow colours and eight arms . The Digambara sect of Jainism gives him six weapons and three heads ; while the <unk> portray him with four to six arms , numerous choices of weapons , though his attributes , the money bag and citron fruit are consistent . He may ride a man or an elephant . He is related to the Buddhist <unk> rather than the Hindu Kubera .

 " Infinity " is a mid @-@ tempo R & B ballad that lasts for a duration of four minutes . The song , in the key of C sharp , has a slow feel and a tempo of 67 beats per minute . Carey 's voice spans three octaves from C ♯ 3 to C ♯ 6 . Carey belts the lines " Close the door , lose the key , leave my heart on the mat for me . I was yours eternally , there 's an end to infinity " , while the songs hook consists of the singer " breathily cooing " the title repeatedly in a descending vocal run . Accompanied by an orchestral synth , string and brass instrumental , Alex Camp of Slant Magazine described " Infinity " as a " welcome throwback to Mariah 's early ballads " . Andrew Unterberger of Spin likened the intro to the work of Just Blaze , and finishes the song with a whistle note . According to its lyrics , Carey is putting herself first in order to emancipate herself . As described by Wass , " Infinity " is " distinctly unromantic " and " a kiss @-@ off anthem " , writing that it sits somewhere in between two of Carey 's previous singles , " Obsessed " ( 2009 ) and " You 're Mine ( Eternal ) " ( 2014 ) . 
 According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group , the song is written in the key of D ♭ major with a tempo of 67 beats per minute . The song is written in cut time and follows a chord progression of G ♭ maj7 – D ♭ / F – E ♭ m7 , with Carey 's vocals spanning three octaves , from D ♭ 3 to D ♭ 6 . 
 The lyric " Boy , you actin ’ so corny like Fritos " generated a positive response from both critics and fans alike , with MTV News reporting that fans were " freaking " over it . Wass described the inclusion of Fritos as " hilarious " , while Camp likened it to a form of product placement . Billboard highlighted the juxtaposition between the chorus , " Close the door / Lose the key / Leave my heart on the mat for me / I was yours eternally / There 's an end to infinity " and one of the verses , " Name hold weight like kilos / Boy you actin ' so corny like Fritos / Wouldn 't have none of that without me , though / Ain 't none of my business , it 's tea though / Outta ammo , gotta reload / If life was a game you 're a free throw / It 's nothing that you don 't already know , " noting that the former is " almost sweet " compared to the latter . 
 The lyrics aroused suspicion amongst critics that it was referring to Carey 's separation from her second husband , Nick Cannon . Daniel D ’ Addario of Time called " Infinity " a " kiss @-@ off track " directed at Cannon , while Camp wrote that the song will be " better remembered " for its lyrical content aimed at Cannon . A reviewer for Billboard wrote that Carey was possibly " returning to form as the queen of post @-@ heartbreak empowerment " , but speculated that the lyrics were most likely about Cannon . Brian Mansfield of USA Today felt that " Infinity " is more of a " kiss @-@ off " than " come @-@ on " track . Unterberger documented that fans would " <unk> " over whether or not the lyrics pertained to her marriage to Cannon . Emilee Linder for MTV News noticed that Carey appeared to refer to their separation and ongoing co @-@ parenting of their twins , Moroccan and Monroe , in the line " Ain 't no being friends / Ain ’ t no false pretense / Ain ’ t no make amends / Ain ’ t no come <unk> / That ’ s the story , ain ’ t no happy ends . " However , Carey has denied that the lyrics are in any way related to her personal life . When Liz Hernandez of Access Hollywood asked if the lyrics were about her relationship with Cannon , Carey responded by saying that it is about putting herself first , and that even if the lyrics were directed at Cannon , she would not publicly confirm it : 
 I don 't feel like it 's my personal life . It 's written for all the women , or men , or whoever 's gone through any type of relationship . I 'm looking at it as the mantra of ' Infinity ' is love yourself … loving yourself first to infinity . Then you can love anybody or anything else – your career , your kids , your life , It 's like someone emancipating themselves . It 's like my re @-@ emancipation of Mimi , I wanted everybody to be able to sing along with [ me ] . It 's a big chorus . I tend to be more private about my personal life anyway , so even if the song were about someone in particular , I would never say that , because that would be like my own private thought . 
 = = Remix = = 
 On July 30 , 2015 , Carey posted a photo on her Instagram account accompanied by Hudson , French Montana and Justin Bieber at recording studio Record Plant in Hollywood . It was reported by TMZ that Carey , Hudson and Montana were working on a remix to " Infinity " , and that Bieber " decided to pop in " . They played the remix to Bieber , who after expressing his admiration for Carey and the song , decided to contribute some vocals to it . On August 8 , TMZ leaked what appeared to be the final mix of the track , called " Why You Mad ? ( Infinity Remix ) " , featuring Montana , Bieber and T.I .. With Carey only performing the hook to the original version of " Infinity " , the theme of the remix is that she rejects each of the three featured artists proposals . The song begins with a " laconic rap " by Montana , followed by Carey singing the hook over a " synth @-@ laden chorus " , which has a heavier instrumental and bass compared to the original version . 
 Bieber begins his verse approximately one minute and forty @-@ five seconds in , singing the new lyrics " It ’ s like every time you call me / You know I can ’ t leave you lonely / ' Cause I was always there when you need / You said that you 'd be there ' til the end / What must I say / I never thought it would happen this way oh / But I can tell if you 're gone again / got my number … things til the end . ” Followed by another chorus and a verse by T.I. , the song ends with a fade . A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration , however Idolator 's Christina Lee was critical of the remix , writing " Two of them don ’ t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses . French ’ s loopy rapping and off @-@ key warbling is incoherent . Justin ’ s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny . " It is the second time that Carey and Bieber have collaborated , the first being when the two re @-@ recorded Carey 's 1994 song " All I Want for Christmas Is You " for Bieber 's 2011 Christmas album Under the Mistletoe .

 " Infinity " garnered a positive response from critics , many of whom complimented its throwback feel , as well as Carey 's vocals and songwriting . Billboard was complimentary of the song , writing " The throwback @-@ flavored track is a soaring break @-@ up track , complete with sassy lines that shut down the guy she 's singing about . " Mansfield and Wass both complimented the non sequitur lyrical couplet of " Boy you so corny like Fritos " and " If life was a game you ’ re a free throw " . Mansfield further noted that although " Infinity " does not " recapture the glory " of past singles " Dreamlover " ( 1993 ) and " Always Be My Baby " ( 1995 ) , " it sure gets the sound right , " while Wass wrote that " Infinity " showcases Carey 's vocal range and " knack for writing hilarious one @-@ liners . " D ’ Addario echoed Wass 's sentiment regarding the couplet , writing that the song is " full of Carey ’ s trademark askew wit " . Unterberger concluded his review by writing that no other singer could perform " Infinity " as well as Carey . Although Camp wrote that " Infinity " delivers everything listeners have come to grow accustomed to hearing from Carey , such as whistle notes and " sudden shifts from chest to head voice " , she disapproved of the drawn out " non @-@ hook " . She further criticised the song 's melodic structure , writing that it appeared to cover up Carey 's " ailing voice " . Despite praising the song , several critics wrote that " Infinity " was unlikely to become her nineteenth number @-@ one on the Billboard Hot 100 .

" DeGarmo commented : " It 's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament ! " She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first , but : " the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland , that sort of thing . We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs , so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them . " Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed " skill to play a bad singer " , to which DeGarmo said that it 's harder than people realize : " but it 's really liberating to get out there and be bad . You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus . " Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer .

Pleasant and Summit Bridge . In 1936 , the road became a state highway between Summit Bridge and Glasgow ; at this time none of present @-@ day DE 896 was assigned a route number . On December 21 , 1936 , the grade crossing with the Pennsylvania Railroad ( now Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor ) along College Avenue in Newark was replaced with a bridge over the tracks . In 1938 , the state highway between Glasgow and Newark was built on a new alignment , bypassing a narrow winding alignment that ran further to the east along what is now Old Cooch 's Bridge Road . This road was built to give Newark a better road connection to places further south . 
 DE 896 was designated by 1938 to run from DE 71 in Summit Bridge north to the Maryland border northwest of Newark , passing through Newark on College Avenue and New London Road . At the state line , the road briefly became MD 278 before becoming PA 896 in Pennsylvania . MD 278 became MD 896 in 1942 to match DE 896 and PA 896 . 
 DE 896 was extended south to US 13 south of Townsend by 1957 , following DE 71 between Summit Bridge and Middletown and replacing DE 71 between Middletown and US 13 . Two years later , US 301S was designated along DE 71 / DE 896 between Summit Bridge and Middletown . The route was realigned to a new Summit Bridge a short distance to the west in 1960 , with a part of the former DE 896 north of the bridge becoming a part of a realigned US 301S / DE 71 . The US 301S designation along DE 71 / DE 896 between Middletown and Summit Bridge became US 301 in 1971 , with US 301N being designated along DE 896 between Summit Bridge and US 40 in Glasgow . 
 By 1984 , DE 896 was realigned to run from Mt . Pleasant to US 13 in Boyds Corner along its current alignment . The former alignment south of Middletown became unnumbered at the time but would become part of DE 71 again by 1990 . The Christiana Parkway around the southern edge of Newark was completed in September 1983 . A year later , US 301 was rerouted to follow DE 896 between Mt . Pleasant and Boyds Corner , with US 301N being removed from the route between Summit Bridge and Glasgow and US 301 removed from the route between route between Mt . Pleasant and Summit Bridge . In 1988 , DE 896 was routed to bypass the University of Delaware campus by heading west along the Christiana Parkway with DE 4 and then northeast on DE 2 before continuing along New London Road . By 1990 , DE 2 was routed to follow DE 4 and DE 896 on the Christiana Parkway and DE 2 Bus. was designated along with DE 896 on Elkton Road . 
 In 1992 , US 301 was realigned to follow DE 896 between Mt . Pleasant and Glasgow . By 1996 , DE 896 was rerouted to bypass Glasgow to the east , with the former alignment becoming DE 896 Bus . In 2012 , the Newark city council voted in favor of renaming the portion of Elkton Road carrying DE 2 Bus . / DE 896 between West Park Place and West Main Street to South Main Street in order to promote businesses along this stretch of road . The change went into effect January 1 , 2013 . In 2013 , the DE 2 and DE 2 Bus. concurrencies were removed from DE 896 in order to simplify the route designations through Newark .

 D.C. United is an American professional soccer club based in Washington , D.C. The club competes in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer , the top level of professional American soccer . The franchise is one of the ten charter clubs of MLS , having competed in the league since its inception in 1996 . 
 D.C. United is the most decorated club in MLS , having won thirteen international and domestic titles over the club 's history . It was one of the most successful clubs in the early years of MLS , winning eight of its thirteen titles between 1996 and 1998 under head coach Bruce Arena . United holds the joint MLS record for most Supporters ' Shields , has four MLS Cups , and been crowned U.S. Open Cup champions three times . It is also the first club to win both the MLS Supporters ' Shield and MLS Cup consecutively . On the international stage , D.C. United has competed in both the CONCACAF Champions League and its predecessor , the CONCACAF Champions ' Cup . The club won the 1998 CONCACAF Champions ' Cup , making them one of only two MLS teams to ever win a CONCACAF tournament . Subsequently , United won the now @-@ defunct Copa Interamericana in 1998 against Vasco da Gama of Brazil . This is the only intercontinental title won by an MLS club . 
 The team 's home field is the 45 @,@ 596 @-@ seat Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium , owned by the District of Columbia and located on the Anacostia River . The team plans to build a new soccer @-@ specific stadium at Buzzard Point just a few blocks from Nationals Park by groundbreaking and starting construction on the new stadium 2015 with an opening date of 2018 , and with potential seating between 18 @,@ 000 and 23 @,@ 000 . The team is owned by the consortium D.C. United Holdings . The team 's head coach is former long @-@ time starting midfielder Ben Olsen , who has coached the team since 2010 . 
 Players such as Jaime Moreno , Marco Etcheverry , and Eddie Pope are among the team 's most successful stars . D.C. United 's fan base includes four supporters ' clubs . The club 's official nickname is the " Black @-@ and @-@ Red " and home uniforms are black and white with accents of red . The team 's name alludes to the " United " appellation commonly found in the names of soccer teams in the United Kingdom and elsewhere . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to the 1994 FIFA World Cup , the United States Soccer Federation fulfilled its promise to FIFA by aiding in the foundation of a new professional league . On June 15 , 1994 , Major League Soccer selected Washington , D.C. out of twenty @-@ two applicants to host one of the first seven teams , with three more added before the league 's launch . Like many team names in MLS , the team 's name was chosen as a reflection of the names of European clubs , such as Manchester United or Leeds United . 
 On April 6 , 1996 , D.C. United played in the league 's inaugural match against the San Jose Clash in Spartan Stadium in San Jose , California . In the league 's early years , D.C. was the most successful of all the teams in MLS . In their first year , coach Bruce Arena led the team to the first " double " in modern U.S. soccer history by beating the Los Angeles Galaxy in the first MLS Cup and the Rochester Raging Rhinos of the USL First Division in the 1996 U.S. Open Cup . D.C. repeated its MLS Cup victory in 1997 against the Colorado Rapids , in front of a home crowd at RFK Stadium . The team also experienced early success in CONCACAF competitions , winning both the Champions ' Cup and the Interamerican Cup in 1998 . 
 In October 1998 , Arena left the team to coach the U.S. men 's national team . Arena 's departure marked the beginning of a downturn in the team 's fortunes . While the club again won the MLS Cup in 1999 under coach Thomas Rongen , lackluster results in 2000 and 2001 led to Rongen 's departure and his replacement by Ray Hudson in 2002 . The team did not , however , fare much better under Hudson , and Piotr Nowak replaced him before the start of the 2004 season . The club 's first season under Nowak was marred by injuries in the early going , and some players were known to have complained about Nowak 's methods . Nevertheless , a strong finish , assisted in large measure by the late @-@ season acquisition of Argentine midfielder Christian Gómez , who helped to propel United into the playoffs as the second seed . There they advanced past the New England Revolution on penalty kicks in what has been called one of the best games in MLS history . United then defeated the Kansas City Wizards to win their fourth MLS Cup . United 's attendance record at RFK Stadium is 54 @,@ 282 , in a match against the Tampa Bay Mutiny in 2001 . 
 On November 18 , 2003 , MLS made sports history by signing Freddy Adu , a 14 @-@ year @-@ old soccer prodigy and on January 16 , 2004 he was officially selected by United with the first pick in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft . When Adu entered United 's regular @-@ season opener as a second @-@ half substitute on April 3 , 2004 , he became the youngest player in any professional sport in the United States since 1887 . On December 11 , 2006 , D.C. United traded Adu and goalkeeper Nick <unk> to Real Salt Lake in exchange for a major allocation , goalkeeper Jay <unk> , and future considerations . 
 In 2005 , the club again made MLS history by becoming the first United States @-@ based team to participate in Copa Sudamericana , entering in the Round of sixteen . Since 2006 , United has played well against international competition , beating Scottish champions Celtic F.C. and drawing Real Madrid in Seattle . In addition , the 2006 MLS All @-@ Star Team , which included eight United players and was managed by United 's manager Piotr Nowak , defeated English champions Chelsea . In 2006 and 2007 , United became the first club in league history to win the MLS Supporters ' Shield consecutively . 
 Since winning back @-@ to @-@ back Shields in 2006 and 2007 , the club failed to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs five years in a row . During this stretch , United 's lone major title came in 2008 , when they won the U.S. Open Cup . In league play during the 2008 and 2009 campaigns , United faltered at the tail @-@ end of each season , ultimately causing them to miss out on the playoffs . They had a poor 2010 MLS season , winning only six matches , drawing four and losing 20 . In 2011 , United again failed to qualify for the playoffs in the second to last week of the campaign . In 2012 , United returned to the playoffs for the first time in five years , clinching a berth in the second @-@ to @-@ last week of the season . 
 D.C. United tallied a total of only 3 wins in the 2013 season , setting a record for fewest wins in league history . Despite the team 's poor showing in league play , D.C. United defeated Real Salt Lake in the U.S. Open Cup final . This qualified the team to participate in the 2014 @-@ 15 CONCACAF Champions League . In 2014 , D.C. United executed a historic turnaround by clinching first place in the Eastern Conference , which also earned the team its second consecutive Champions League berth .

 The team 's colors and original logo were announced on October 17 , 1995 along with those of the other ten original teams during a presentation in New York City . Black and white are D.C. United 's primary colors , though the team 's nickname is the " Black @-@ and @-@ Red . " Red is used to accent the home jersey while white is the main color of the team 's away kit . The three stripes along the shoulder – in white at home and black on the road – do not represent the three jurisdictions of the Washington Metropolitan Area ( Washington , D.C. , Maryland , and Virginia ) ; rather , they represent the fact that the team 's kits are made by Adidas . United 's shirt sponsor is Reston , Virginia defense company <unk> . In 2011 , the team introduced a predominantly red third kit with black accents to be worn four or more times in the season . The team has also previously used white away uniforms with red stripes ; white and red are the colors of the flag of Washington , D.C. , and the stripes are also reminiscent of those used on the flag . 
 The team 's original shield was implemented in 1996 consisting of the team 's name , D.C. United , above a black bald eagle facing right on a red field , clawing three soccer balls overlaid on three white stars . The three stars and balls were intended to represent the region 's three jurisdictions . The bird , associated with the federal government based in Washington , D.C. , symbolizes many of the attributes of the team , including speed and power . The logo was redesigned before the 1998 season . The current design reoriented the eagle facing left , and removed the three stars below it , whose metaphor was retained by three raised wing feathers . At the center of the eagle is a single gold @-@ colored star and soccer ball , which represents the team 's victory in Major League Soccer 's inaugural cup in 1996 . The logo can also be adorned with four silver stars above it , representing the MLS Cups the team has won . 
 On December 10 , 2015 , D.C. United unveiled an updated logo designed by Peter <unk> , featuring a D.C. flag @-@ inspired design across the eagle , an updated wordmark , and more dynamic wings .

 Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium ( RFK ) has been home to D.C. United since the club 's founding in 1996 . The D.C. United Training Complex is located north of the stadium , and is where the Reserve Division team plays . 
 RFK was built in 1961 as a dual use baseball and American football stadium . Prior to 1996 , it periodically hosted soccer matches , including the 1980 Soccer Bowl , the 1993 Supercoppa Italiana , and five matches during the 1994 FIFA World Cup . When the Washington Nationals baseball team shared the field from 2005 to 2007 , there were criticisms regarding problems with the playing surface and even the dimensions of the field . 
 Several regional university stadiums have been used by the team for Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup matches , including Klöckner Stadium in Charlottesville , Virginia in 1996 , and George Mason Stadium in Fairfax , Virginia in 2010 . Similarly , the team has also used the Maryland SoccerPlex in Germantown , Maryland for multiple early @-@ round games in U.S. Open Cup and CONCACAF Champions ' Cup since it opened in 2001 . Exhibition games , as well as occasional regular season matches , have also been played in nearby FedEx Field in Landover , Maryland ; the latter have generally been played as part of doubleheaders featuring friendlies between national teams or foreign clubs . 
 = = = New DC United Stadium = = = 
 In July 2006 , D.C. United proposed building a new stadium along the Anacostia River near Anacostia Park , but disputes with the city government forced the team to consider other sites . In February 2009 , the team announced plans for a new stadium in nearby Prince George 's County , Maryland close to FedEx Field . This proposal ran into similar trouble , however , when the County Council voted to send a letter to the Maryland General Assembly opposing the stadium plan . In October 2009 , the Baltimore Sun reported that Baltimore mayor Sheila Dixon has asked the Maryland Stadium Authority to explore the possibility of wooing D.C. United to Baltimore by building a soccer stadium that could serve as D.C. United 's permanent home , as well as host other events . The Baltimore plan did not coalesce , however , and the team returned its focus to Washington D.C. 
 On July 25 , 2013 , a tentative deal was announced which will see a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ 25 @,@ 000 seat stadium built at Buzzard Point costing $ 300 million . Following votes by the D.C. Council to approve the plan , it was signed into law on December 30 , 2014 . Under the July 2013 deal , the District of Columbia was to have obtained a portion of the necessary Buzzard Point property from the developer that owned it , in exchange for cash and a government building . DC United would kick the $ 150 million needed to construct the stadium on the city @-@ owned land , which it would rent for 20 to 35 years . The deal also gave DC United the right to build restaurants , bars , and even a hotel nearby . Under the deal as revised by D.C. City Council in December 2014 , the city would instead pay fair market value for the developer 's land , and use eminent domain if a deal could not be reached . 
 When negotiations began in January 2015 , D.C. Council chairman Phil Mendelson was downbeat about the talks , saying the two sides were " very far apart " on a price . Mayor Muriel Bowser , Gray 's successor , budgeted $ 106 @.@ 3 million in fiscal 2016 to acquire the stadium site , add infrastructure ( such as water , sewer , electrical , and natural gas lines ) , and remove toxic hazards at the site . 
 Following reports that the club had spoken with city , county , and state officials in Virginia about abandoning the District of Columbia and constructing a stadium in Northern Virginia , D.C. United and the city signed a final construction agreement on June 8 . The agreement required that the facility seat a minimum of 17 @,@ 000 people , and established the term of the lease at 30 years for a minimal $ 1 per year . The agreement also contained a clause governing land : If the cost of land acquisition rose above $ 150 million , D.C. United was required to reimburse the city 50 percent of the excess ( although the club 's commitment was capped at $ 10 million ) . The club was also barred from playing more than an occasional home game away from the Buzzard Point stadium ( e.g. , barred from relocating for the term of the lease ) . Mayor Bowser then submitted the agreement , as well as land purchase agreements and a revised developer agreement , to the City Council for approval ; the council approved the land purchase agreements on June 30 , 2015 . 
 Under the terms of the June 8 agreement , D.C. United was required to submit a concept design for the stadium to the city by September 1 , 2015 . The District of Columbia faced a deadline for September 30 , 2015 , to use eminent domain to acquire the Akridge land , which forces the club to commit to building a stadium before the city finished purchasing land . On September 30 , the District of Columbia filed for eminent domain for the Akridge parcel .

 D.C. United has four major supporters groups ; La Barra Brava , the Screaming Eagles , La Norte and the District Ultras . Each group has a designated section of the home stadium . La Barra Brava , Spanish for " The Brave Fans " , was founded in 1995 by Latino fans in the Washington , D.C. area , mostly Bolivian immigrants in support of original United players Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno . They seek to bring a South American style to home games . All four clubs host public <unk> before home matches , and are known for singing during games .

 When the league was founded in 1995 , billionaire investor George Soros was the primary financial backer and director of Washington Soccer L.P. , the group that owned the operating rights to D.C. United . Kevin Payne , former President of Soccer USA Partners and current CEO of D.C. United , was instrumental in organizing this ownership group . By 1998 the group was looking for new investors , and on February 15 , 2001 , it agreed to sell the team to Anschutz Entertainment Group ( AEG ) , founded by Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz , with AEG exercising its option to become the sole investor @-@ operator on January 8 , 2002 . AEG , who also own Major League Soccer 's Los Angeles Galaxy and Houston Dynamo , ran the team until 2007 . 
 In May 2007 , United entered into an initial one @-@ year strategic partnership with Brazilian club Atlético Mineiro . The goal of the partnership is to enhance the sporting and commercial success of the respective clubs by sharing expertise and experience as well as creating new opportunities for the clubs in both areas . 
 On January 8 , 2007 , the operating rights to D.C. United were sold to D.C. United Holdings , a newly formed group venture that included real estate developer Victor MacFarlane , founder of MacFarlane Partners , and William H.C. Chang , chairman of Westlake International Group . Other investors included D.C. United president Kevin Payne and Blue Devil Development , headed by former Duke basketball players Brian Davis and Christian Laettner . In April 2009 , Victor MacFarlane sold his share of the team to his partner William Chang after two stadium proposals had fallen through . In October 2009 , Chang also bought out Davis and Laettner to fully control the team . Chang is also one of the primary investors of Major League Baseball 's San Francisco Giants . In July 2012 , Erick Thohir and Jason Levien , minority owners of the Philadelphia 76ers National Basketball Association franchise , joined Chang as partners .

 The film flashes back to the morning of June 6 , 1944 , the beginning of the Normandy Invasion , as American soldiers prepare to land on Omaha Beach . They suffer heavily from their struggle against German infantry , machine gun nests , and artillery fire . Captain John H. Miller , a company commander of the 2nd Ranger Battalion , survives the initial landing and assembles a group of his Rangers to penetrate the German defenses , leading to a breakout from the beach . After the battle , the body of a dead soldier lying face down on the beach , with " S. Ryan " inscribed on the back of his uniform , is shown . 
 Meanwhile , in Washington , D.C , at the U.S. War Department , General George Marshall is informed that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were killed in action and that their mother is to receive all three telegrams in the same day . He learns that the fourth son , Private First Class James Francis Ryan , is a paratrooper and is missing in action somewhere in Normandy . Marshall , after reading Abraham Lincoln 's Bixby letter , orders that Ryan must be found and sent home immediately . 
 Three days after D @-@ Day , Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back from the front . He assembles six men from his company — T / Sgt. Mike Horvath , Private First Class Richard Reiben , Privates Stanley Mellish , Adrian <unk> , Danny Jackson , medic Irwin Wade — and T / 5 Timothy Upham , a cartographer who speaks French and German , loaned from the 29th Infantry Division . Miller and his men move out to Neuville ; there , they meet a squad from the 101st Airborne Division . <unk> dies after being shot by a sniper . 
 Eventually , they locate a Private James Ryan , but soon learn that he is not their man . They find a member of Ryan 's regiment who informs them that his drop zone was at Vierville and that his and Ryan 's companies had the same rally point . Once they reach it , Miller meets a friend of Ryan 's , who reveals that Ryan is defending a strategically important bridge over the Merderet River in the town of Ramelle . On the way to Ramelle , Miller decides to neutralize a German machine gun position , despite the misgivings of his men . Wade is fatally wounded in the ensuing skirmish , but Miller , at Upham 's urging , declines to execute a surviving German , nicknamed " Steamboat Willie " , and sets him free on condition that he give himself up as a prisoner of war to the first Allied unit he encounters . No longer confident in Miller 's leadership , Reiben declares his intention to desert the squad and the mission , prompting a confrontation with Horvath . The argument heats up until Miller defuses the situation by disclosing his background in civilian life , about which the squad had earlier set up a betting pool . Reiben then reluctantly decides to stay . 
 Upon arrival at Ramelle , Miller and the squad come upon a small group of paratroopers , one of whom is Ryan . Ryan is told of his brothers ' deaths , the mission to bring him home , and that two men had been lost in the quest to find him . He is distressed at the loss of his brothers , but does not consider it fair to go home , asking Miller to tell his mother that he intends to stay " with the only brothers [ he has ] left . " Miller decides to take command and defend the bridge with what little manpower and resources are available . Using his own men and the accompanying paratroopers , Miller forms ambush positions throughout the ruined town for the tanks and infantry utilizing Molotov cocktails , detonation cords , and " sticky bombs " made from socks and TNT . 
 Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division arrive with infantry and armor . Although they inflict heavy casualties on the Germans , most of the paratroopers , along with Jackson , Mellish , and Horvath , are killed . While attempting to blow the bridge , Miller is shot and mortally wounded by a German soldier . Just before a Tiger tank reaches the bridge , an American P @-@ 51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank , followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans . Upham surprises a group of German soldiers as they attempt to retreat . The German infantryman who shot Miller , " Steamboat Willie " , raises his hands in surrender , believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter . Having witnessed Captain Miller being shot by Steamboat Willie , Upham shoots him and lets the other surviving Germans flee . 
 Reiben and Ryan are with Miller as he dies and says his last words , " James ... earn this . Earn it . " The film returns to the present and it is revealed that the veteran is Ryan and the grave he is standing at is Miller 's . Ryan asks his wife to confirm that he has led a good life , that he is a " good man " and thus worthy of the sacrifice of Miller and the others . His wife replies , " You are . " At this point , Ryan stands at attention and delivers a salute toward Miller 's grave .

 In 1994 , Robert Rodat wrote the script for the film . Rodat 's script was submitted to producer Mark Gordon , who liked it and in turn passed it along to Spielberg to direct .

 Before filming began , several of the film 's stars , including Edward Burns , Barry Pepper , Vin Diesel , Adam Goldberg , Giovanni Ribisi , and Tom Hanks , endured ten days of " boot camp " training led by Marine veteran Dale Dye and Warriors , Inc . , a California @-@ based company that specializes in training actors for realistic military portrayals . Matt Damon was intentionally not brought into the camp , to make the rest of the group feel resentment towards the character . 
 Spielberg had already demonstrated his interest in World War II themes with the films 1941 , Empire of the Sun , Schindler 's List , and the Indiana Jones series . Spielberg later co @-@ produced the World War II themed television miniseries Band of Brothers and its counterpart The Pacific with Tom Hanks . When asked about this by American Cinematographer , Spielberg said , " I think that World War II is the most significant event of the last 100 years ; the fate of the baby boomers and even Generation X was linked to the outcome . Beyond that , I 've just always been interested in World War II . My earliest films , which I made when I was about 14 years old , were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air . For years now , I 've been looking for the right World War II story to shoot , and when Robert Rodat wrote Saving Private Ryan , I found it . "

 Saving Private Ryan has received critical acclaim for its realistic portrayal of World War II combat . In particular , the sequence depicting the Omaha Beach landings was named the " best battle scene of all time " by Empire magazine and was ranked number one on TV Guide 's list of the " 50 Greatest Movie Moments " . The scene cost US $ 12 million and involved up to 1 @,@ 500 extras , some of whom were members of the Irish Reserve Defence Forces . Members of local reenactment groups such as the Second Battle Group were cast as extras to play German soldiers . In addition , twenty to thirty actual amputees were used to portray American soldiers maimed during the landing . Spielberg did not storyboard the sequence , as he wanted spontaneous reactions and for " the action to inspire me as to where to put the camera " . 
 The historical representation of Charlie Company 's actions , led by its commander , Captain Ralph E. Goranson , was well maintained in the opening sequence . The sequence and details of the events are very close to the historical record , including the sea sickness experienced by many of the soldiers as the landing craft moved toward the shoreline , significant casualties among the men as they disembarked from the boats , and difficulty linking up with adjacent units on the shore . 
 The distinctive signature " ping " of the US soldiers ' M1 Garand rifles ejecting their ammunition clips is heard throughout the battle sequence . The contextual details of the Company 's actions were well maintained , for instance , the correct code names for the sector Charlie Company assaulted , and adjacent sectors , were used . Included in the cinematic depiction of the landing was a follow @-@ on mission of clearing a bunker and trench system at the top of the cliffs which was not part of the original mission objectives for Charlie Company , but which they did undertake after the assault on the beach . 
 The landing craft used included twelve actual World War II examples , 10 LCVPs and 2 LCMs , standing in for the British LCAs that the Ranger Companies rode in to the beach during Operation Overlord . The filmmakers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water . Forty barrels of fake blood were used to simulate the effect of blood in the seawater . This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles , as few examples survive in operating condition . The Tiger I tanks in the film were copies built on the chassis of old , but functional , Soviet T @-@ 34 tanks . The two vehicles described in the film as Panzers were meant to portray Marder III tank destroyers . One was created for the film using the chassis of a Czech @-@ built Panzer 38 ( t ) tank similar to the construction of the original Marder III ; the other was a cosmetically modified Swedish SAV m / 43 assault gun , which also used the 38 ( t ) chassis . 
 Inevitably , some artistic license was taken by the filmmakers for the sake of drama , distorting the historical veracity of the film 's presentation . There are strategic and operational , as well as tactical flaws in the film 's depiction of the Normandy campaign . There is a strategic problem in that at the time of the mission , American forces from the two American beach areas - Utah and Omaha - had not yet linked up . Had such a mission been executed in reality , a Ranger team operating out of the Omaha beach area would have had to move through the heavily enemy @-@ occupied city of Carentan , or swim or boat across the estuary linking Carentan to the channel , or transfer by boat to the Utah landing area . On the other hand , US forces moving out of Utah would have had direct and much shorter routes , relatively unencumbered by enemy positions , and were already in contact with some teams from both US airborne divisions landed in the area . 
 The Utah beach landings , however , were relatively uncontested , with assault units landing on largely unoccupied beaches and experiencing far less action than the landings at Omaha . The filmmakers chose to begin the narrative with a depiction of the more dramatic story of Omaha , despite the strategic inaccuracy of an impossible mission that could easily have been pursued from the other beach area . In addition , one of the most notable of the operational flaws is the depiction of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle . The 2nd SS was not engaged in Normandy until July , and then at Caen against the British and Canadians , 100 miles east . Furthermore , the Merderet River bridges were not an objective of the 101st Airborne Division but of the 82nd Airborne Division , part of Mission Boston . 
 Much has also been said about various " tactical errors " made by both the German and American forces in the film 's climactic battle . Spielberg responded , saying that in many scenes he opted to replace sound military tactics and strict historical accuracy for dramatic effect . Some other technical errors were also made , often censored , including the mistaken reversed orientation of the beach barriers ; the tripod obstructions with a mine at the apex . 
 To achieve a tone and quality that was true to the story as well as reflected the period in which it is set , Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński , saying , " Early on , we both knew that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II , but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s , which is very desaturated and low @-@ tech . " Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses , making them closer to those used in the 1940s . He explains that " without the protective coating , the light goes in and starts bouncing around , which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus . " The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass , a process that reduces brightness and color saturation . The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences , as opposed to the standard of 180 @-@ degree timing . Kamiński clarifies , " In this way , we attained a certain staccato in the actors ' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions , which makes them slightly more realistic . "

 Saving Private Ryan was a critical and commercial success and is credited with contributing to a resurgence in America 's interest in World War II . Old and new films , video games , and novels about the war enjoyed renewed popularity after its release . The film 's use of desaturated colors , hand @-@ held cameras , and tight angles has profoundly influenced subsequent films and video games . Saving Private Ryan was released in 2 @,@ 463 theaters on July 24 , 1998 , and grossed $ 30 @.@ 5 million on its opening weekend . The film grossed $ 216 @.@ 5 million in North America and $ 265 @.@ 3 million in other territories , bringing its worldwide total to $ 481 @.@ 8 million and making it the highest @-@ grossing domestic film of the year . Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 45 @.@ 74 million tickets in North America . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 The film received universal critical acclaim and has a ' certified fresh ' rating of 92 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 130 reviews with an average score of 8 @.@ 6 out of 10 . The consensus states " Anchored by another winning performance from Hanks , Spielberg 's unflinchingly realistic war film virtually redefines the genre . " The film also has a score of 90 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 34 reviews indicating " universal acclaim " . 
 Much of the praise went for the realistic battle scenes and the actors ' performances . It earned some criticism for ignoring the contributions of several other countries to the D @-@ Day landings in general and at Omaha Beach specifically . The most direct example of the latter is that during the actual landing the 2nd Rangers disembarked from British ships and were taken to Omaha Beach by Royal Navy landing craft ( LCAs ) . The film depicts them as being United States Coast Guard @-@ crewed craft ( LCVPs and LCMs ) from an American ship , the USS Thomas Jefferson ( APA @-@ 30 ) . This criticism was far from universal with other critics recognizing the director 's intent to make an " American " film . The film was not released in Malaysia after Spielberg refused to cut the violent scenes ; however , the film was finally released there on DVD with an <unk> certificate much later in 2005 . Many critics associations , such as New York Film Critics Circle and Los Angeles Film Critics Association , chose Saving Private Ryan as Film of the Year . Roger Ebert gave it four stars out of four and called it " a powerful experience " . 
 Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino has expressed admiration for the film and has cited it as an influence on his 2009 film , Inglourious Basterds . Conversely , film director and military veteran Oliver Stone has accused the film of promoting " the worship of World War II as the good war , " and has lumped it alongside films such as Gladiator and Black Hawk Down that he believes were well @-@ made , but may have inadvertently contributed to Americans ' readiness for the 2003 invasion of Iraq . In defense of the film 's portrait of warfare , Brian De Palma commented , " The level of violence in something like Saving Private Ryan makes sense because Spielberg is trying to show something about the brutality of what happened . " 
 Actor Richard Todd , who performed in The Longest Day and was amongst the first of the Allied soldiers to land in Normandy ( Sword Beach ) , said the film was " Rubbish . <unk> . " American academic Paul Fussell , who saw combat in France during World War II , objected to what he described as , " the way Spielberg 's Saving Private Ryan , after an honest , harrowing , 15 @-@ minute opening visualizing details of the unbearable bloody mess at Omaha Beach , degenerated into a harmless , uncritical patriotic performance apparently designed to thrill 12 @-@ year @-@ old boys during the summer bad @-@ film season . Its genre was pure cowboys and Indians , with the virtuous cowboys of course victorious . " 
 Other World War II veterans , however , stated that the film was the most realistic depiction of combat they had ever seen . The film was so realistic that combat veterans of D @-@ Day and Vietnam left theaters rather than finish watching the opening scene depicting the Normandy invasion . Their visits to posttraumatic stress disorder counselors rose in number after the film 's release , and many counselors advised " ' more psychologically vulnerable ' " veterans to avoid watching it . 
 = = = Awards = = = 
 The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards , and won five including Best Cinematography , Best Sound , Best Sound Effects Editing , Best Film Editing , and Best Director for Spielberg , but lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare in Love , being one of a few that have won the Best Director award without also winning Best Picture . The Academy 's decision to not award the film with the Best Picture Oscar has resulted in much criticism in recent years , many of whom believe it is one of the biggest Oscar snubs in its history . 
 The film also won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Director , the BAFTA Award for Special Effects and Sound , the Directors Guild of America Award , a Grammy Award for Best Film Soundtrack , the Producers Guild of America Golden Laurel Award , and the Saturn Award for Best Action , Adventure , or Thriller Film . The American Film Institute has included Saving Private Ryan in many of its lists , ranking it as the 71st greatest American movie in AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies ( 10th Anniversary Edition ) , as well as the 45th most thrilling film in AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Thrills , the 10th most inspiring in AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Cheers , and the eight best epic film in " AFI 's 10 Top 10 " .

 On Veterans Day from 2001 – 2004 , the American Broadcasting Company aired the film uncut and with limited commercial interruption . The network airings were given a TV @-@ MA rating , as the violent battle scenes and the profanity were left intact . The 2004 airing was marred by pre @-@ <unk> in many markets because of the language , in the backlash of Super Bowl XXXVIII 's halftime show controversy . However , critics and veterans ' groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars assailed those stations and their owners , including Hearst @-@ Argyle Television ( owner of 12 ABC affiliates ) ; Scripps Howard Broadcasting ( owner of six ) ; and Belo ( owner of four ) for putting profits ahead of programming and honoring those who gave their lives at wartime , saying the stations made more money running their own programming instead of being paid by the network to carry the film , especially during a sweeps period . 
 A total of 65 ABC affiliates — 28 % of the network — did not clear the available timeslot for the film , even with the offer of The Walt Disney Company , ABC 's parent , to pay all fines for language to the Federal Communications Commission . In the end , however , no complaints were lodged against ABC affiliates who showed Ryan , perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the unedited rebroadcast of the film . Additionally , some ABC affiliates in other markets that were near affected markets , such as Youngstown , Ohio , ABC affiliate WYTV ( which is viewable in parts of the Columbus , Cleveland , and Pittsburgh markets , none of which aired the film ) and Gainesville , Florida , ABC affiliate <unk> @-@ TV ( which is viewable in parts of the Orlando and Tampa markets ) , still aired the film and gave those nearby markets the option of viewing the film .

 = Eskaya people = 
 The Eskaya , less commonly known as the Visayan @-@ Eskaya , is the collective name for the members of a cultural minority found in Bohol , Philippines , which is distinguished by its cultural heritage , particularly its literature , language , dress and religious observances . After the Eskaya first came to public attention in 1980 , these cultural practices were the subject of intense speculation on the part of local journalists and amateur historians who made diverse claims about the ethnolinguistic status of the Eskaya people . The unique Eskayan language and writing system in particular has been a source of fascination and controversy . Some journalists argued that the Eskaya were historically displaced from the Middle East , while others suggested that the community was a cult speaking an invented language . According to Eskaya mythology , the language and script was created through divine inspiration by the ancestor Pinay who based it on the human body . Suppressed by the Spanish colonists , Pinay 's language was said to have resurfaced under the leadership of Mariano Datahan ( ca . 1875 – 1949 ) , a veteran of Bohol 's republican army . Although the historical existence of Pinay cannot be confirmed , more recent studies that combined linguistic analysis with oral history and genealogical research provide evidence that the Eskaya language was most likely created and disseminated within a generation by a charismatic individual . Today , the Eskaya are officially classified as an Indigenous Cultural Community under The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997 ( Republic Act No. 8371 ) . A number of reports have suggested that Eskaya linguistic and cultural education has been in steady decline since the mid @-@ 1980s , although promising revitalisation efforts have also been documented . 
 = = Area = = 
 Most members of the Eskaya community inhabit a mountainous area that intersects the municipalities of Duero , <unk> , Pilar , and Sierra <unk> in the once @-@ forested region of Bohol 's southeast interior . The original Eskaya settlement in Biabas ( <unk> ) , was established in 1902 . In 1951 , the second township of Taytay ( municipality of Duero ) was founded by Fabian Baja in accordance with Datahan 's directions . Significant Eskaya populations are now also found in the nearby townships of <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Fatimah . In 1996 , the Eskaya community was awarded a certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim by President Fidel Ramos . An official census of the Eskaya population has not yet been made . One report estimates that in 1991 there were 130 Eskaya families living in Bohol . 
 = = Language and script = = 
 The <unk> speak a Boholano dialect of Cebuano in daily life . Boholano @-@ Bisaya is the dominantly used language among the languages spoken by the members of the Eskayan tribe . This variety is used in their close familial interactions , in their conversations with their neighbors in the community , in their transactions in the barangay , school meetings , social gatherings , church rituals and in the trade and commerce . However , they are better known for an auxiliary language , known as Eskayan , or <unk> , which is used for prayers , songs , and formal speeches . Lexically , Eskayan shows no clear relationship with any known language ( however , considered to be an encryption of Cebuano ) although there is strong but inconsistent Spanish influence . A striking feature of the language is its unusual phonotactics . 
 The Eskayan writing system takes the form of a syllabary of over 1 @,@ 000 characters , all modeled on parts of the human body including internal organs . This unique script has been compared variously to Phoenician , Etruscan , Hebrew , and even the undeciphered script of the Butuan <unk> . While there are no mother @-@ tongue speakers of Eskayan , it is taught to both adults and children in volunteer @-@ run cultural schools . The Eskayan language and script has been the object of ongoing controversy . 
 = = Religion = = 
 Under the direction of Mariano Datahan , the group converted en masse to the nascent Philippine Independent Church in about 1902 . Community members revere the entity <unk> which is conflated with the Santo Niño , and in addition to weekly church services they are served by appointed spiritual leaders known as <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> , or bishop , is responsible for performing harvest ceremonies and other rituals such as house blessing . Before a house can be constructed , a ritual is performed in which a spiritual leader asks the permission of the spirits . If permission is not granted , the builder must select a new site . The Eskaya also retain spiritual traditions once widespread in lowland Boholano rural communities . 
 = = Eskaya society = = 
 The teaching of Eskayan in the volunteer schools is one of the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community . 
 Formerly , Eskaya men would wear shirts made of <unk> raffia with a Chinese @-@ style collar , black breeches , and cotton berets . Women wore <unk> dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish @-@ influenced Boholano style ( mostly in Biabas ) and covered their hair with cotton habits ( mostly in Taytay ) . Traditionally , women were not permitted to cut their hair short nor wear trousers , and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited . For the most part these customs have been discontinued , however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions . 
 At weddings the parents of the bride offer the couple a glass of water and a comb . The comb is dipped in the water and run through the hair of both bride and groom . Rice is then showered on the couple , <unk> plenty . 
 Until recently , the Eskaya practised a form of communal farming in which a portion of land was tilled for the benefit of the whole community . 
 = = Literature and mythology = = 
 Eskaya literature was first dictated for transcription by Mariano Datahan whose words were recorded by personal scribes . These texts – which comprise local oral history and regional folklore – have sometimes been referred to by journalists as the <unk> mga libro or " old books " . The transcribed oral literature is mostly written in both Cebuano and Eskayan ; one is reported to be in Spanish . The Eskaya stories are fundamental to the community ’ s understanding of itself , particularly its origins , belief systems , and practices . One legend tells of how the group first arrived in Bohol from Sumatra . Their first leader , <unk> , had twelve children who settled near Antequera before moving east . Various other Eskayan legends recount the stories of Boholano kings and heroes ; a few of these stories even make reference to actual historical figures such as Jesus Christ , Datu Sikatuna , Ferdinand Magellan , and Francisco " Dagohoy " <unk> . As part of their cultural education , students must transcribe five of these texts into lined textbooks at the Eskaya schools . 
 The Eskaya writings mentioned by researchers are as follows : <unk> , Ang <unk> sa <unk> , Ang <unk> ni <unk> , Ang <unk> na <unk> , Ang mga <unk> ug <unk> ni Mariano Datahan , Ang <unk> @-@ an sa <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Pinay , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Tao sa Bisaya sa Bohol . Identical texts sometimes go by different names and larger texts may subsume smaller ones . Brenda <unk> , a former curator of the Bohol Museum , has mentioned a folded book of esoteric knowledge written in Spanish but its existence has not been established . 
 = = History = = 
 Although the Eskaya had been known to people living in the vicinity of Bohol ’ s southeast highlands prior to World War II , it was only in the early 1980s that they came to wider public attention when government agricultural advisers toured the province to introduce Green Revolution policies . Local journalists and researchers have since suggested various theories on the origins of the Eskaya but there is still no broad consensus on the subject . 
 As far as documented evidence is concerned , genealogies attest that many of the predecessors of those living in the communities today originally came from the town of Loon on Bohol ’ s western coast ; Mariano Datahan is reported to have arrived at the site of present @-@ day Biabas at the turn of the nineteenth century ; The Philippine Independent Church in Biabas was established in 1902 ; Datahan wrote a letter to President Manuel Quezon in 1937 ; and the resistance hero Col. Esteban <unk> records a meeting with Datahan in Biabas in 1944 . A project to document the history of the Eskaya community via the Eskayan language is presently being undertaken at The Australian National University . 
 = = Theories and controversies = = 
 The Eskaya community has been the object of ongoing controversy , particularly with regards to its status as an indigenous group and the classification of the Eskayan language . Intense speculation in the 1980s and 1990s on the part of journalists and lay historians generated a number of theories that continue to be elaborated without resolution . 
 It has been argued variously that the Eskaya are a remnant of the original indigenous settlers on Bohol ; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra in the seventh century A.D. ; that they are descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy ; that they are a cult or secret society ; or that they are a conscious reconstruction of an imagined pre @-@ colonial society . 
 Some of the more unusual proposals are that the Eskaya people are a Semitic proto @-@ Christian tribe ; that they possess the lost book of Enoch ; that they are descended from the builders of King Solomon ’ s temple ; that their existence proves the imminence of a second Messiah in Bohol ; or that they guard esoteric secrets . 
 Likewise , the Eskayan speech variety has been associated with languages as disparate as Hebrew , Greek , and Etruscan . Recent studies have revealed that the syntax of Eskayan is virtually identical to that of Boholano @-@ Visayan , lending weight to the theory that Eskayan is actually an auxiliary variety of this language .

 The jaguar ( Panthera onca ) is a big cat , a feline in the Panthera genus , and is the only extant Panthera species native to the Americas . The jaguar is the third @-@ largest feline after the tiger and the lion , and the largest in the Americas . The jaguar 's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina . Apart from a known and possibly breeding population in Arizona ( southeast of Tucson ) and the <unk> of New Mexico , the cat has largely been extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century . 
 This spotted cat most closely resembles the leopard physically , although it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer to those of the tiger . While dense rainforest is its preferred habitat , the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrains . Its preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions , but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts . The jaguar is notable , along with the tiger , as a feline that enjoys swimming . The jaguar is largely a solitary , opportunistic , stalk @-@ and @-@ ambush predator at the top of the food chain ( an apex predator ) . It is a keystone species , playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of the animals it hunts . The jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite , even relative to the other big cats . This allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles and to employ an unusual killing method : it bites directly through the skull of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain . 
 The jaguar is a near threatened species and its numbers are declining . Threats include loss and fragmentation of habitat . While international trade in jaguars or their parts is prohibited , the cat is still frequently killed by humans , particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America . Although reduced , its range remains large . Given its historical distribution , the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous indigenous American cultures , including those of the Maya and Aztec . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word ' jaguar ' comes to English from one of the Tupi – Guarani languages , presumably the Amazonian trade language Tupinambá , via Portuguese jaguar . The <unk> word , <unk> " beast " , is sometimes translated as " dog " . The specific word for jaguar is <unk> , with the suffix <unk> meaning " real " or " true " . 
 The first component of its taxonomic designation , Panthera , is Latin , from the Greek word for leopard , <unk> , the type species for the genus . This has been said to derive from the <unk> " all " and <unk> from <unk> " predator " , meaning " predator of all " ( animals ) , though this may be a folk etymology — it may instead be ultimately of Sanskrit origin , from <unk> , the Sanskrit word for " tiger " . In Mexican Spanish , its nickname is el tigre : 16th century Spaniards had no native word in their language for a cat smaller than a lion but bigger than a leopard nor had ever encountered such a creature in the Old World , and so named it after a cat whose ferocity would have only been known to them through Roman writings , popular literature during the Renaissance . 
 <unk> is the Portuguese onça , with the <unk> dropped for typographical reasons , found in English as ounce for the snow leopard , Panthera <unk> . It derives from the Latin <unk> lynx , with the letter L confused with the definite article ( Italian <unk> , Old French l <unk> ) . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 The jaguar , Panthera onca , is the only extant New World member of the genus Panthera . DNA evidence shows the lion , tiger , leopard , jaguar , snow leopard , and clouded leopard share a common ancestor , and that this group is between six and ten million years old ; the fossil record points to the emergence of Panthera just two to 3 @.@ 8 million years ago . Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the clouded leopard ( Neofelis nebulosa ) is basal to this group . The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved . 
 Based on morphological evidence , British zoologist Reginald Pocock concluded the jaguar is most closely related to the leopard . However , DNA evidence is inconclusive and the position of the jaguar relative to the other species varies between studies . Fossils of extinct Panthera species , such as the European jaguar ( Panthera <unk> ) and the American lion ( Panthera atrox ) , show characteristics of both the lion and the jaguar . Analysis of jaguar mitochondrial DNA has dated the species ' lineage to between 280 @,@ 000 and 510 @,@ 000 years ago , later than suggested by fossil records . 
 While jaguars now live only in the Americas , they are descended from Old World cats . Two million years ago , scientists believe , the jaguar and its closest relative , the similarly spotted leopard , shared a common ancestor in Asia . In the early Pleistocene , the forerunners of modern jaguars crossed Beringia , the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait and connected Asia and North America . These jaguar ancestors then moved south into Central and South America , feeding on the deer and other grazing animals that once covered the landscape in huge herds . 
 = = = Geographical variation = = = 
 The last taxonomic delineation of the jaguar subspecies was performed by Pocock in 1939 . Based on geographic origins and skull morphology , he recognized eight subspecies . However , he did not have access to sufficient specimens to critically evaluate all subspecies , and he expressed doubt about the status of several . Later consideration of his work suggested only three subspecies should be recognized . 
 Recent studies have also failed to find evidence for well @-@ defined subspecies , which are no longer recognized . Larson ( 1997 ) studied the morphological variation in the jaguar and showed there is clinal north – south variation , but also the differentiation within the supposed subspecies is larger than that between them , and thus does not warrant subspecies subdivision . A genetic study by <unk> and coworkers in 2001 confirmed the absence of a clear geographical subspecies structure , although they found that major geographical barriers , such as the Amazon River , limited the exchange of genes between the different populations . A subsequent , more detailed study confirmed the predicted population structure within the Colombian jaguars . 
 Pocock 's subspecies divisions are still regularly listed in general descriptions of the cat . Seymour grouped these in three subspecies . 
 Panthera onca onca : Venezuela through the Amazon , including 
 P. o. peruviana ( Peruvian jaguar ) : Coastal Peru 
 P. o. <unk> ( Mexican jaguar ' ) : Western Mexico – including 
 P. o. centralis ( Central American jaguar ) : El Salvador to Colombia 
 P. o. <unk> ( Arizonan jaguar ) : Southern Arizona to Sonora , Mexico 
 P. o. <unk> ( Panthera onca <unk> ) : Central Texas to southeastern Mexico 
 P. o. <unk> ( Goldman 's jaguar ) : Yucatán Peninsula to Belize and Guatemala 
 P. o. palustris ( Pantanal jaguar , it is the largest subspecies , weighing more than 135 kg or 300 lb ) : The Pantanal regions of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul , Brazil , along the Paraguay River into Paraguay and northeastern Argentina . 
 The Mammal Species of the World continues to recognize nine subspecies , the eight subspecies above and additionally P. o. paraguensis . In addition , extinct subspecies P. o. <unk> and P. o. <unk> lived throughout the Americas during the Pleistocene . 
 = = Biology and behavior = = 
 = = = Physical characteristics = = = 
 The jaguar , a compact and well @-@ muscled animal , is the largest cat in the New World and the largest carnivorous mammal in Central and South America . Size and weight vary considerably : weights are normally in the range of 56 – 96 kg ( 124 – 211 lb ) . Larger males have been recorded to weigh as much as 158 kg ( 348 lb ) ( roughly matching a tigress or lioness ; however note this animal was weighed with a full stomach ) . The smallest females have low weights of 36 kg ( 79 lb ) . Females are typically 10 – 20 percent smaller than males . The length , from the nose to the base of the tail , of the cats varies from 1 @.@ 12 to 1 @.@ 85 m ( 3 @.@ 7 to 6 @.@ 1 ft ) . Their tails are the shortest of any big cat , at 45 to 75 cm ( 18 to 30 in ) in length . Their legs are also short , considerably shorter when compared to a small tiger or lion in a similar weight range , but are thick and powerful . The jaguar stands 63 to 76 cm ( 25 to 30 in ) tall at the shoulders . Compared to the similarly colored Old World leopard , the jaguar is bigger , heavier and relatively stocky in build . 
 Further variations in size have been observed across regions and habitats , with size tending to increase from the north to south . A study of the jaguar in the Chamela @-@ Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve on the Mexican Pacific coast , showed ranges of just about 50 kg ( 110 lb ) , about the size of a female cougar . Jaguars in Venezuela or Brazil are much larger with average weights of about 95 kg ( 220 lb ) in males and of about 56 kilograms ( 123 lb ) to 78 kilograms ( 172 lb ) in females . In the Brazilian Pantanal , weights of 136 kilograms ( 300 lb ) or more are not uncommon in old males , with the highest recorded weight , for a Jaguar weighed on an empty stomach being 148 kilograms ( 326 lb ) . Forest jaguars are frequently darker and considerably smaller than those found in open areas ( the Pantanal is an open wetland basin ) , possibly due to the smaller numbers of large , herbivorous prey in forest areas . 
 A short and stocky limb structure makes the jaguar adept at climbing , crawling , and swimming . The head is robust and the jaw extremely powerful , it has the third highest bite force of all felids , after the lion and tiger . A 100 kg ( 220 lb ) jaguar can bite with a force of 503 @.@ 57 kgf ( 1110 lbf ) at canine teeth and 705 @.@ 79 kgf ( 1556 lbf ) at carnassial notch . This strength adaptation allows the jaguar to pierce turtle shells . A comparative study of bite force adjusted for body size ranked it as the top felid , alongside the clouded leopard and ahead of the lion and tiger . It has been reported that " an individual jaguar can drag an 800 lb ( 360 kg ) bull 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) in its jaws and pulverize the heaviest bones " . The jaguar hunts wild animals weighing up to 300 kg ( 660 lb ) in dense jungle , and its short and sturdy physique is thus an adaptation to its prey and environment . 
 = = = Coloration = = = 
 The base coat of the jaguar is generally a tawny yellow , but can range to reddish @-@ brown and black , for most of the body . However , the ventral areas are white . The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat . The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars : rosettes may include one or several dots , and the shapes of the dots vary . The spots on the head and neck are generally solid , as are those on the tail , where they may merge to form a band . 
 While the jaguar closely resembles the leopard , it is sturdier and heavier , and the two animals can be distinguished by their rosettes : the rosettes on a jaguar 's coat are larger , fewer in number , usually darker , and have thicker lines and small spots in the middle that the leopard lacks . Jaguars also have rounder heads and shorter , stockier limbs compared to leopards . 
 = = = = Color morphism = = = = 
 Color morphism occurs in the species . A near @-@ black melanistic form occurs regularly . Jaguars with melanism appear entirely black , although their spots are still visible on close examination . 
 The black morph is less common than the spotted form but , at about six percent of the population , it is several orders of magnitude above the mutation rate . Hence , it is being supported by selection . Some evidence indicates the melanism allele is dominant . The black form may be an example of heterozygote advantage ; breeding in captivity is not yet conclusive on this . 
 Melanistic jaguars are informally known as black panthers , but ( as with all forms of polymorphism ) they do not form a separate species . 
 Extremely rare albino individuals , sometimes called white panthers , also occur among jaguars , as with the other big cats . As usual with albinos in the wild , selection keeps the frequency close to the rate of mutation . 
 = = = Reproduction and life cycle = = = 
 Jaguar females reach sexual maturity at about two years of age , and males at three or four . The cat is believed to mate throughout the year in the wild , although births may increase when prey is plentiful . Research on captive male jaguars supports the year @-@ round mating hypothesis , with no seasonal variation in semen traits and ejaculatory quality ; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity . Female estrus is 6 – 17 days out of a full 37 @-@ day cycle , and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization . Both sexes will range more widely than usual during courtship . 
 Pairs separate after mating , and females provide all parenting . The gestation period lasts 93 – 105 days ; females give birth to up to four cubs , and most commonly to two . The mother will not tolerate the presence of males after the birth of cubs , given a risk of infanticide ; this behavior is also found in the tiger . 
 The young are born blind , gaining sight after two weeks . Cubs are weaned at three months , but remain in the birth den for six months before leaving to accompany their mother on hunts . They will continue in their mother 's company for one to two years before leaving to establish a territory for themselves . Young males are at first nomadic , jostling with their older counterparts until they succeed in claiming a territory . Typical lifespan in the wild is estimated at around 12 – 15 years ; in captivity , the jaguar lives up to 23 years , placing it among the longest @-@ lived cats . 
 = = = Social activity = = = 
 Like most cats , the jaguar is solitary outside mother – cub groups . Adults generally meet only to court and mate ( though limited <unk> socialization has been observed anecdotally ) and carve out large territories for themselves . Female territories , which range from 25 to 40 km2 in size , may overlap , but the animals generally avoid one another . Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area , varying in size with the availability of game and space , and do not overlap . The territory of a male can contain those of several females . The jaguar uses scrape marks , urine , and feces to mark its territory . 
 Like the other big cats , the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn territorial and mating competitors away ; intensive bouts of counter @-@ calling between individuals have been observed in the wild . Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough , and they may also vocalize mews and grunts . Mating fights between males occur , but are rare , and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild . When it occurs , conflict is typically over territory : a male 's range may encompass that of two or three females , and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males . 
 The jaguar is often described as nocturnal , but is more specifically crepuscular ( peak activity around dawn and dusk ) . Both sexes hunt , but males travel farther each day than females , befitting their larger territories . The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline , spending as much as 50 – 60 percent of its time active . The jaguar 's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight , let alone study . 
 = = = Hunting and diet = = = 
 Like all cats , the jaguar is an obligate carnivore , feeding only on meat . It is an opportunistic hunter and its diet encompasses at least 87 species . The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America , with a preference for large prey . The jaguar is more of a dietary generalist than its Old World cousins : the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors . They regularly take adult caimans , deer , capybaras , tapirs , peccaries , dogs , <unk> , and sometimes even anacondas . However , the cat will eat any small species that can be caught , including frogs , mice , birds ( mainly ground @-@ based species such as <unk> ) , fish , sloths , monkeys , and turtles ; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize , for example , revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas . Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock . 
 There is evidence that jaguars in the wild consume the roots of <unk> <unk> . 
 While the jaguar often employs the deep throat @-@ bite and suffocation technique typical among Panthera , it sometimes uses a killing method unique amongst cats : it pierces directly through the temporal bones of the skull between the ears of prey ( especially the capybara ) with its canine teeth , piercing the brain . This may be an adaptation to " cracking open " turtle shells ; following the late Pleistocene extinctions , armored reptiles such as turtles would have formed an abundant prey base for the jaguar . The skull bite is employed with mammals in particular ; with reptiles such as the caiman , the jaguar may leap onto the back of the prey and sever the cervical vertebrae , immobilizing the target . When attacking sea turtles , including the huge Leatherback sea turtle which weighs about 385 kg ( 849 lb ) on average , as they try to nest on beaches , the jaguar will bite at the head , often beheading the prey , before dragging it off to eat . Reportedly , while hunting horses , a jaguar may leap onto their back , place one paw on the muzzle and another on the nape and then twist , dislocating the neck . Local people have anecdotally reported that when hunting a pair of horses bound together , the jaguar will kill one horse and then drag it while the other horse , still living , is dragged in their wake . With prey such as smaller dogs , a paw swipe to the skull may be sufficient to kill it . 
 The jaguar is a stalk @-@ and @-@ ambush rather than a chase predator . The cat will walk slowly down forest paths , listening for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing . The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target 's blind spot with a quick pounce ; the species ' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers , and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments . The ambush may include leaping into water after prey , as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming ; its strength is such that carcasses as large as a heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels . 
 On killing prey , the jaguar will drag the carcass to a thicket or other secluded spot . It begins eating at the neck and chest , rather than the midsection . The heart and lungs are consumed , followed by the shoulders . The daily food requirement of a 34 kg ( 75 lb ) animal , at the extreme low end of the species ' weight range , has been estimated at 1 @.@ 4 kg ( 3 @.@ 1 lb ) . For captive animals in the 50 – 60 kg ( 110 – 130 lb ) range , more than 2 kg ( 4 @.@ 4 lb ) of meat daily are recommended . In the wild , consumption is naturally more erratic ; wild cats expend considerable energy in the capture and kill of prey , and they may consume up to 25 kg ( 55 lb ) of meat at one feeding , followed by periods of famine . Unlike all other Panthera species , jaguars very rarely attack humans . However , jaguar attacks appear to be on the rise with increased human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations . Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Distribution and habitat = = = 
 The jaguar has been an American cat since crossing the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene epoch ; the immediate ancestor of modern animals is Panthera onca <unk> , which was larger than the contemporary cat . Its present range extends from Mexico , through Central America and into South America , including much of Amazonian Brazil . The countries included in this range are Argentina , Belize , Bolivia , Brazil , Colombia , Costa Rica ( particularly on the Osa Peninsula ) , Ecuador , French Guiana , Guatemala , Guyana , Honduras , Mexico , Nicaragua , Panama , Paraguay , Peru , Suriname , the United States and Venezuela . The jaguar is now extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay . It occurs in the 400 km ² Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize , the 5 @,@ 300 km ² Sian Ka 'an Biosphere Reserve in Mexico , the approximately 15 @,@ 000 km2 <unk> National Park in Peru , the approximately 26 @,@ 000 km2 <unk> National Park in Brazil , and numerous other reserves throughout its range . 
 The inclusion of the United States in the list is based on occasional sightings in the southwest , particularly in Arizona , New Mexico and Texas . In the early 20th century , the jaguar 's range extended as far north as the Grand Canyon , and as far west as Southern California . The jaguar is a protected species in the United States under the Endangered Species Act , which has stopped the shooting of the animal for its pelt . In 1996 and from 2004 on , wildlife officials in Arizona photographed and documented jaguars in the southern part of the state . Between 2004 and 2007 , two or three jaguars have been reported by researchers around Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in southern Arizona . One of them , called ' Macho B ' , had been previously photographed in 1996 in the area . For any permanent population in the USA to thrive , protection from killing , an adequate prey base , and connectivity with Mexican populations are essential . In February 2009 , a 53 @.@ 5 kg ( 118 lb ) jaguar was caught , radio @-@ collared and released in an area southwest of Tucson , Arizona ; this is farther north than had previously been expected and represents a sign there may be a permanent breeding population of jaguars within southern Arizona . The animal was later confirmed to be indeed the same male individual ( ' Macho B ' ) that was photographed in 2004 . On 2 March 2009 , Macho B was recaptured and euthanized after he was found to be suffering from kidney failure ; the animal was thought to be 16 years old , older than any known wild jaguar . 
 Completion of the United States – Mexico barrier as currently proposed will reduce the viability of any population currently residing in the United States , by reducing gene flow with Mexican populations , and prevent any further northward expansion for the species . 
 The historic range of the species included much of the southern half of the United States , and in the south extended much farther to cover most of the South American continent . In total , its northern range has receded 1 @,@ 000 km ( 621 mi ) southward and its southern range 2 @,@ 000 km ( 1243 mi ) northward . Ice age fossils of the jaguar , dated between 40 @,@ 000 and 11 @,@ 500 years ago , have been discovered in the United States , including some at an important site as far north as Missouri . Fossil evidence shows jaguars of up to 190 kg ( 420 lb ) , much larger than the contemporary average for the animal . 
 The habitat of the cat includes the rain forests of South and Central America , open , seasonally flooded wetlands , and dry grassland terrain . Of these habitats , the jaguar much prefers dense forest ; the cat has lost range most rapidly in regions of drier habitat , such as the Argentine pampas , the arid grasslands of Mexico , and the southwestern United States . The cat will range across tropical , subtropical , and dry deciduous forests ( including , historically , oak forests in the United States ) . The jaguar prefers to live by rivers , swamps , and in dense rainforest with thick cover for stalking prey . Jaguars have been found at elevations as high as 3 @,@ 800 m , but they typically avoid montane forest and are not found in the high plateau of central Mexico or in the Andes . The jaguars preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions , but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts . 
 = = = Ecological role = = = 
 The adult jaguar is an apex predator , meaning it exists at the top of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild . The jaguar has also been termed a keystone species , as it is assumed , through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals , apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems . However , accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult , because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats , while controlling for the effects of human activity . It is accepted that mid @-@ sized prey species undergo population increases in the absence of the keystone predators , and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects . However , field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained . Thus , the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists . 
 The jaguar also has an effect on other predators . The jaguar and the cougar , the next @-@ largest feline of the Americas , are often sympatric ( related species sharing overlapping territory ) and have often been studied in conjunction . Where sympatric with the jaguar , the cougar is smaller than normal and is smaller than the local jaguars . The jaguar tends to take larger prey , usually over 22 kg ( 49 lb ) and the cougar smaller , usually between 2 and 22 kg ( 4 @.@ 4 and 48 @.@ 5 lb ) , reducing the latter 's size . This situation may be advantageous to the cougar . Its broader prey niche , including its ability to take smaller prey , may give it an advantage over the jaguar in human @-@ altered landscapes ; while both are classified as near @-@ threatened species , the cougar has a significantly larger current distribution . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 Jaguar populations are rapidly declining . The animal is considered Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , meaning it may be threatened with extinction in the near future . The loss of parts of its range , including its virtual elimination from its historic northern areas and the increasing fragmentation of the remaining range , have contributed to this status . The 1960s had particularly significant declines , with more than 15 @,@ 000 jaguar skins brought out of the Brazilian Amazon yearly ; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 1973 brought about a sharp decline in the pelt trade . Detailed work performed under the auspices of the Wildlife Conservation Society revealed the animal has lost 37 percent of its historic range , with its status unknown in an additional 18 percent . More encouragingly , the probability of long @-@ term survival was considered high in 70 percent of its remaining range , particularly in the Amazon basin and the adjoining Gran Chaco and Pantanal . In 1990 Belize created the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary as the world 's first wilderness reserve for jaguar protection and study . 
 Given the inaccessibility of much of the species ' range , particularly the central Amazon , estimating jaguar numbers is difficult . Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions , thus species @-@ wide analysis is scant . In 1991 , 600 – 1 @,@ 000 ( the highest total ) were estimated to be living in Belize . A year earlier , 125 – 180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico 's 4 @,@ 000 @-@ km2 ( 2400 @-@ mi2 ) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve , with another 350 in the state of Chiapas . The adjoining Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala , with an area measuring 15 @,@ 000 km2 ( 9 @,@ 000 mi2 ) , may have 465 – 550 animals . Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100 km2 in the critical Pantanal region , compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods ; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats . 
 The major risks to the jaguar include deforestation across its habitat , increasing competition for food with human beings , poaching , hurricanes in northern parts of its range , and the behavior of ranchers who will often kill the cat where it preys on livestock . When adapted to the prey , the jaguar has been shown to take cattle as a large portion of its diet ; while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species , the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America , as the animals took advantage of the new prey base . This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full @-@ time jaguar hunters . 
 The skins of wild cats and other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades . From the beginning of the 20th @-@ century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers , but over @-@ harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s . The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970 , due to the growing economy and lack of regulations . From 1967 onwards , the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as <unk> skins in 1967 , through 7000 skins in 1969 , until it became negligible after 1976 , although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem . During this period , the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay , and the biggest importers were the USA and Germany . 
 The jaguar is regulated as an Appendix I species under CITES : all international trade in jaguars or their parts is prohibited . All hunting of jaguars is prohibited in Argentina , Belize , Colombia , French Guiana , Honduras , Nicaragua , Panama , Paraguay , Suriname , the United States ( where it is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act ) , Uruguay and Venezuela . Hunting of jaguars is restricted to " problem animals " in Brazil , Costa Rica , Guatemala , Mexico and Peru , while trophy hunting is still permitted in Bolivia . The species has no legal protection in Ecuador or Guyana .

 The only extant cat native to North America that roars , the jaguar was recorded as an animal of the Americas by Thomas Jefferson in 1799 . There are multiple zoological reports of jaguars in California , two as far north as Monterey in 1814 ( Langsdorff ) and 1826 ( Beechey ) . The coastal <unk> ( Kumeyaay people ) of San Diego and Cahuilla Indians of Palm Springs had words for jaguar and the cats persisted there until about 1860 . The only recorded description of an active jaguar den with breeding adults and kittens in the U.S. was in the Tehachapi Mountains of California prior to 1860 . In 1843 , Rufus Sage , an explorer and experienced observer recorded jaguar present on the headwaters of the North Platte River 30 – 50 miles north of Long 's Peak in Colorado . Cabot 's 1544 map has a drawing of jaguar ranging over the Pennsylvania and Ohio valleys . Historically , the jaguar was recorded in far eastern Texas , and the northern parts of Arizona and New Mexico . However , since the 1940s , the jaguar has been limited to the southern parts of these states . Although less reliable than zoological records , Native American artefacts with possible jaguar motifs range from the Pacific Northwest to Pennsylvania and Florida . 
 Jaguars were rapidly eliminated in the United States . The last female jaguar in the United States was shot by a hunter in Arizona 's White Mountains in 1963 . Arizona outlawed jaguar hunting in 1969 , but by then no females remained and over the next 25 years only two male jaguars were found ( and killed ) in Arizona . Then in 1996 , Warner Glenn , a rancher and hunting guide from Douglas , Arizona , came across a jaguar in the <unk> Mountains and became a jaguar researcher , placing webcams which recorded four more Arizona jaguars . None of the other four male jaguars sighted in Arizona in the last 15 years have been seen since 2006 . Then , in 2009 , a male jaguar named Macho B , died shortly after being radio @-@ collared by Arizona Game and Fish Department ( <unk> ) officials in 2009 . In the Macho B incident , a former <unk> subcontractor pleaded guilty to violating the endangered species act for trapping the cat and a Game and Fish employee was fired for lying to federal investigators . In 2011 , a 200 @-@ pound male jaguar was photographed near Cochise in southern Arizona by a hunter after being treed by his dogs ( the animal left the scene unharmed ) . A second 2011 sighting of an Arizona jaguar was reported by a Homeland Security border pilot in June 2011 , and conservation researchers sighted two jaguars within 30 miles of the Mexico / U.S. border in 2010 . In September 2012 , a jaguar was photographed in the Santa Rita Mountains of Arizona , the second such sighting in this region in two years . Apparently this jaguar has been photographed numerous times over the past nine months through June 2013 . On February 3 , 2016 , the Center for Biological Diversity released a video of this jaguar - now named El Jefe - roaming the Santa Rita Mountains , about 25 miles south of downtown Tucson . 
 Legal action by the Center for Biological Diversity led to federal listing of the cat on the endangered species list in 1997 . However , on January 7 , 2008 , George W. Bush appointee H. Dale Hall , Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) , signed a recommendation to abandon jaguar recovery as a federal goal under the Endangered Species Act . Critics , including the Center of Biological Diversity and New Mexico Department of Game and Fish , were concerned the jaguar was being sacrificed for the government 's new border fence , which is to be built along many of the cat 's typical crossings between the United States and Mexico . In 2010 , the Obama Administration reversed the Bush Administration policy and pledged to protect " critical habitat " and draft a recovery plan for the species . The USFWS was ultimately ordered by the court to develop a jaguar recovery plan and designate critical habitat for the cats . On August 20 , 2012 , the USFWS proposed setting aside 838 @,@ 232 acres in Arizona and New Mexico — an area larger than Rhode Island — as critical jaguar habitat . On March 4 , 2014 Federal wildlife officials set aside nearly 1 @,@ 200 square miles along the U.S.-Mexico border as habitat essential for the conservation of the jaguar . The reservation includes parts of Pima , Santa Cruz and Cochise counties in Arizona and Hidalgo County in New Mexico . In September 2015 the jaguar " El Jefe " was photographed via camera trap and analysis of his spots confirms that he has been in southeastern Arizona ( 30 miles south of Tucson ) since 2011 . Jaguars have been present in this region every year since 1997 . El Jefe and other males may have originated from a breeding population in Sonora , Mexico , 125 miles ( 200 kilometers ) to the south of Tucson .

 Current conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting ecotourism . The jaguar is generally defined as an umbrella species – its home range and habitat requirements are sufficiently broad that , if protected , numerous other species of smaller range will also be protected . Umbrella species serve as " mobile links " at the landscape scale , in the jaguar 's case through predation . Conservation organizations may thus focus on providing viable , connected habitat for the jaguar , with the knowledge other species will also benefit . 
 Jaguar conservation is complicated by the species ' extremely large range which spans 18 countries with different policies and regulations . One approach has been to pinpoint specific areas of high importance for jaguar conservation efforts , so @-@ called " hotspots " . These hotspots , described as jaguar conservation units , are large areas populated by about 50 jaguars . This method has been used in tiger conservation , and has seen some success . Each unit was graded on a scale integrating unit size , connectivity , habitat quality , jaguar hunting , prey hunting , and jaguar population status into a prioritization assessment . The result of an analysis across the Jaguar ’ s historic range was the identification of about 51 areas that are priorities for jaguar conservation . However , recent studies underlined that to maintain the robust exchange across the jaguar gene pool necessary for maintaining the species , it is important that jaguar habitats are interconnected . To facilitate this , a new project , the Paseo del Jaguar , has been established to connect several jaguar hotspots . 
 In setting up protected reserves , efforts generally also have to be focused on the surrounding areas , as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation , especially if the population is increasing in size . Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective . 
 To estimate population sizes within specific areas and to keep track of individual jaguars , camera trapping and wildlife tracking telemetry are widely used , and feces may be sought out with the help of detector dogs to study jaguar health and diet . 
 Ecotourism setups are being used to generate public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar , while at the same time generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts . Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation . As with large African cats , a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires , so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation , some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact , or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place .

 In pre @-@ Columbian Central and South America , the jaguar was a symbol of power and strength . Among the Andean cultures , a jaguar cult disseminated by the early Chavín culture became accepted over most of what is today Peru by 900 BC . The later Moche culture of northern Peru used the jaguar as a symbol of power in many of their ceramics . 
 In Mesoamerica , the Olmec — an early and influential culture of the Gulf Coast region roughly contemporaneous with the Chavín — developed a distinct " were @-@ jaguar " motif of sculptures and figurines showing stylised jaguars or humans with jaguar characteristics . In the later Maya civilization , the jaguar was believed to facilitate communication between the living and the dead and to protect the royal household . The Maya saw these powerful felines as their companions in the spiritual world , and a number of Maya rulers bore names that incorporated the Mayan word for jaguar ( b 'alam in many of the Mayan languages ) . The Aztec civilization shared this image of the jaguar as the representative of the ruler and as a warrior . The Aztecs formed an elite warrior class known as the Jaguar Knights . In Aztec mythology , the jaguar was considered to be the totem animal of the powerful deity Tezcatlipoca . 
 = = = Contemporary culture = = = 
 The jaguar and its name are widely used as a symbol in contemporary culture . It is the national animal of Guyana , and is featured in its coat of arms . The flag of the Department of Amazonas , a Colombian department , features a black jaguar silhouette pouncing towards a hunter . The jaguar also appears in banknotes of Brazilian real . The jaguar is also a common fixture in the mythology of many contemporary native cultures in South America , usually being portrayed as the creature which gave humans the power over fire . 
 Jaguar is widely used as a product name , most prominently for a British luxury car brand . The name has been adopted by sports franchises , including the NFL 's Jacksonville Jaguars and the Mexican soccer club Chiapas F.C. The crest of Argentina 's national federation in rugby union features a jaguar ; however , because of a journalist error , the country 's national team is nicknamed Los Pumas . In the spirit of the ancient Mayan culture , the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City adopted a red jaguar as the first official Olympic mascot . 
 = Cyclone Nilofar = 
 Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Nilofar was , at the time , the third @-@ strongest cyclone in the Arabian Sea . In late October 2014 , it reached peak maximum sustained winds estimated between 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) and 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) . The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) named it Nilofar ; the name refers to the water lily , and was suggested by Pakistan . The western fringes of the storm caused flash flooding in northeastern Oman , killing four people . 
 Nilofar originated from a low pressure area between India and the Arabian Peninsula . It developed into a depression on October 25 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions . The system intensified into a cyclonic storm on October 26 . Quickly organizing due to the conditions , Nilofar developed a well @-@ defined eye and structure , attaining its peak intensity on October 28 . At the time , Nilofar was expected to make landfall in western India , prompting evacuations and preparations . However , high wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken , and Nilofar degraded into a remnant low pressure area on October 31 off the Indian state of Gujarat . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Toward the middle of October 2014 , the monsoon trough was active over the Arabian Sea off the west coast of India . A circulation formed on October 19 near the Lakshadweep archipelago , remaining nearly stationary for several days . It developed a distinct low pressure area on October 21 , and produced an intense area of convection by the next day . Despite moderate wind shear , conditions favored further development , including warm water temperatures and good outflow , amplified by an anticyclone to its east @-@ northeast . The structure became more organized by October 24 , when broken rainbands were rotating around a poorly @-@ defined circulation . That day , the American @-@ based Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified it as a tropical depression , although the agency did not issue warnings at the time . At 00 : 00 UTC on October 25 , the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) classified the system as a depression about 1270 km ( 790 mi ) southeast of Muscat , Oman . 
 When the system first formed , it benefited from warm water temperatures of 28 to 30 ° C ( 82 to 86 ° F ) and a favorable phase of the Madden – Julian oscillation . Moderate wind shear and continued interaction with the monsoon dislocated the bulk of the deepest convection to the western periphery . By 12 : 00 UTC on October 25 , the system organized enough for the JTWC to classify it as Tropical Cyclone 04A , and there were hints of an eye feature within the thunderstorms . By the time of classification , the storm was moving to the northeast , steered by the subtropical ridge to the south , although the motion slowed on October 26 due to competing influence of another subtropical ridge to the northwest . That day , the system strengthened quickly ; the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression at 03 : 00 UTC , to Cyclonic Storm Nilofar at 06 : 00 UTC , and further to a severe cyclonic storm at 21 : 00 UTC . At 00 : 00 UTC on October 27 , the JTWC upgraded Nilofar to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , based on the development of a 54 km ( 33 mi ) eye . Throughout that day , the cyclone turned more to the northwest as a ridge built to the east , while the inner core of convection became more symmetrical and compact . Also by that time , tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that Nilofar would eventually recurve to the northeast and make landfall in western India . 
 At 06 : 00 UTC on October 27 , the IMD upgraded Nilofar to a very severe cyclonic storm . The storm was rapidly intensifying at the time , after the wind shear had decreased , and the eye contracted to a diameter of 19 km ( 12 mi ) . At 09 : 00 UTC on October 28 , the IMD upgraded Nilofar further to an extremely severe cyclonic storm . Six hours later , the JTWC estimated peak 1 @-@ minute winds of 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) ; at the time , the agency anticipated further strengthening due to the favorable conditions and good organization . At 18 : 00 UTC on October 28 , the IMD estimated peak 3 @-@ minute winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . At the time , it was the third @-@ strongest storm on record in the Arabian Sea . On October 29 , Nilofar started weakening due to increased wind shear , and the convection diminished in intensity . At the same time , the storm turned northeastward while rounding the ridge to the east . Increasingly cooler and drier air , as well as cooler waters , caused the storm to degrade rapidly . The eye , previously small and well defined , dissipated by 06 : 00 UTC on October 29 . Later that day , the center began decoupling from the convection , a sign of rapid weakening , and by 21 : 00 UTC the IMD downgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm . Early on October 30 , the JTWC downgraded Nilofar to a tropical storm , and subsequently the circulation became exposed from the convection . At 18 : 00 UTC that day , the JTWC posted their final advisory . Nilofar weakened further into a depression on October 31 , and soon after degenerated into a remnant low off coast of the Indian state of Gujarat .

 Offshore buoys recorded 3 @.@ 2 m ( 10 @.@ 5 ft ) waves and winds of 41 km / h ( 25 mph ) . The outskirts of the storm caused flash flooding in Al @-@ Rustaq in northeastern Oman , killing four people after a vehicle was swept away in a flooded wadi . Five people were rescued when another car was stranded amid floods west of Al @-@ Rustaq . 
 In the storm 's developmental stages , the outskirts of Nilofar dropped 410 mm ( 16 in ) of rainfall in Margao , Goa , helping the state record its wettest October in four years . Other nearby areas along India 's west coast received heavy rainfall . The threat of the storm prompted officials to evacuate nearly 30 @,@ 000 people in western India , utilizing 200 storm shelters . Most of the displaced people were living in thatched huts and weak structures . In coastal areas , schools were canceled for two days . Most of the evacuees quickly returned home after the storm weakened . To minimize damage , trees were trimmed down to eliminate damage due to falling debris , and a total suspension of fishing activities was ordered , with about 5 @,@ 000 boats advised to return to port . Officials in Gujarat sent a warning of the storm to all operators of ham radios . A distant warning signal 2 was hoisted in the ports of Kandla and Mundra . National Disaster Response Force deployed rescue and rehabilitation teams at <unk> , Dwarka , Porbandar , Veraval , Rajkot and Bhuj while standby teams were stationed at Ahmedabad and Vadodara . After facing problems during deadly floods in September and Cyclone Hudhud in October , mobile companies enacted greater preparations during Nilofar to guarantee operations during the storm , including an emergency hotline , setting up internet in shelters , and mobile cell towers . Despite the threat from the storm , Nilofar only produced light rainfall and gusty winds along the Gujarat coast . Unseasonable rainfall damaged mangoes in Maharashtra , causing prices to rise . Shifting air patterns brought cooler temperatures to western India , signaling the end of the monsoon season , while also bringing haze and smog over Delhi from polluting areas to the south . 
 In Pakistan , fishermen were also warned to avoid the sea , and people in coastal areas were evacuated . The country 's navy , coast guard , Maritime Security Agency , and fishermen organizations helped rescue fishermen stationed offshore . Along the coast of Sindh province , bathing and swimming were banned for several days . There were minor power outages in Karachi due to heavy rainfall from Nilofar . 
 = Typhoon Choi @-@ wan ( 2009 ) = 
 Typhoon Choi @-@ wan was a powerful typhoon that became the first Category 5 equivalent @-@ super typhoon to form during the 2009 Pacific typhoon season . Forming on September 11 , 2009 , about 1100 km ( 700 mi ) to the east of Guam , the initial disturbance rapidly organized into a tropical depression . By September 12 , the depression intensified into a tropical storm , at which time it was given the name Choi @-@ wan . The following day , rapid intensification took place through September 14 . Choi @-@ wan attained its peak intensity on September 15 , as it moved through the Northern Mariana Islands with the Japan Meteorological Agency reporting peak windspeeds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph 10 @-@ minute sustained ) . Additionally , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported the storm to have attained winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph 1 @-@ minute sustained ) . The typhoon remained very powerful until September 17 when the storm 's outflow weakened . The typhoon underwent an eyewall replacement cycle , leading to intensity fluctuations . By September 19 , Choi @-@ wan rapidly weakened as strong wind shear caused convection to diminish . The following day , the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated several hours later over open waters . 
 Despite the intensity of Choi @-@ wan when it passed through the Northern Mariana Islands , no casualties were reported . However , following the storm , the United States Navy deemed that the island of Alamagan was uninhabitable , with all but one of the structures completely destroyed and most of the islands ' trees downed . In response to this , all residents on the island were evacuated to nearby Saipan . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Early on September 11 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring an area of convection roughly 1 @,@ 100 km ( 700 mi ) east of Guam . A broad , low @-@ level circulation center had formed within the system and became increasingly organized , showing signs of developing convective banding . A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was released later that day as convection was rapidly consolidating around the low , which was embedded within the eastern end of the monsoonal trough . It was then declared as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) and the JTWC with the latter designating it as Tropical Depression 15W The tropical depression was tracking westward along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge situated east of the international dateline . 
 During September 12 , the depression continued to develop quickly with both the JMA and the JTWC reporting that the depression had intensified into a Tropical Storm later that day , with the JMA assigning the international name of Choi @-@ wan and the international designation of <unk> . During September 13 , Choi @-@ wan gradually developed whilst moving west with the JMA reporting that Choi @-@ wan had become a severe tropical storm late that day , before reporting along with the JTWC early the next day that Choi @-@ wan had intensified further and had become a weak Typhoon with multiple spiral bands that had wrapped into the fully consolidated center to form a banding eye . During September 14 , Choi @-@ wan intensified further whilst moving along the southwestern edge of a deep level subtropical ridge of the northeast , intensifying into a Category 4 @-@ equivalent typhoon on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale with 1 @-@ minute winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) . 
 Early on September 15 , the JTWC reported that Typhoon Choi @-@ wan had intensified further and had become a Category 4 @-@ equivalent Super Typhoon whilst passing over the island of Alamagan . Later that day the JMA reported that Typhoon Choi @-@ wan had reached its 10 @-@ minute peak wind speeds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) and a pressure of 915 hPa ( mbar ) . Typhoon Choi @-@ wan then intensified further and reached its peak 1 @-@ minute wind speeds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) which made it the first Category 5 @-@ equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale anywhere in the world in 2009 . 
 With the help of excellent poleward outflow and high ocean heat content , Typhoon Choi @-@ wan remained at its peak intensity until early on September 17 when deep convection started to erode in the northwestern quadrant as the tropical upper tropospheric trough ( TUTT ) cell to the northwest was no longer providing good outflow . Choi @-@ wan was then downgraded to a typhoon by the JTWC as it started to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle , with the JTWC reporting a secondary peak intensity of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) , during the next day . During September 19 , Choi @-@ wan rapidly weakened , as it moved into an unfavorable environment with higher amounts of vertical wind shear , causing the storm 's deep convection to erode . As a result of this and dry latitude air wrapping into the low level circulation center , the JTWC decided to downgrade Choi @-@ wan to an extratropical system and released their final advisory , early the next day before the JMA followed suit later that day . The JMA then reported that the extratropical low had dissipated completely , early on September 21 .

 Early on September 12 , the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Guam , using data from the JTWC , placed Tinian and Saipan under a Typhoon Watch whilst declaring a Tropical Storm Watch also declared for Guam and Rota . By September 15 , the islands of Agrihan , Tinian and Saipan before being upgraded to tropical storm warnings and a typhoon watch . Additionally , the watches in place for Guam and Rota were discontinued . These warnings were kept in force until late on September 14 , when the warnings for Tinian were canceled and the typhoon watch for Saipan was canceled , while the typhoon watch was upgraded to a Typhoon Warning as Choi @-@ wan rapidly intensified . The Tropical Storm Warning in place for Saipan was canceled during September 15 as Choi @-@ wan intensified into a high @-@ end Category 4 equivalent super typhoon . All watches and warnings were discontinued during the afternoon of September 16 once Choi @-@ wan was no longer a threat to the Mariana Islands . 
 By September 15 , shelters were opened throughout Tinian and Saipan at local schools , most schools and all governmental buildings were closed and residents rushed to board up their homes . The American Red Cross had also mobilized on the islands by this time . Some private schools were open during the morning but let out early to allow students to return to their families before the typhoon 's arrival . On Saipan , 179 residents sought refuge in shelters by the afternoon of September 15 , by which time heavy rain had begun falling . Only one flight was delayed by the typhoon across all the islands . The youth basketball league in the Northern Mariana Islands canceled their games for the time Choi @-@ wan passed through the islands . At the height of the storm , a total of 270 residents sought refuge in shelters on Saipan .

 Early on September 16 the JMA started to issue Typhoon force wind warnings , for the Naha , Okinawa ; however these were discontinued later that day . The JMA then placed the Yokohama , Moji and Naha under a Typhoon Warning early the next day . These warnings were kept in place until early on September 19 , when the JMA added the Kushiro and Otaru to the warnings . However , the warnings were dropped for all areas except Yokohama and Kushiro as the typhoon turned away from Japan . These warnings stayed in effect until late the next day when they were cancelled as Choi @-@ wan began to dissipate . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 On September 15 , the eye of Choi @-@ wan passed within 10 km ( 5 mi ) of Alamagan and brought winds of up to 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) to the island . The most recent storm of Choi @-@ wan 's intensity to strike the islands was Typhoon Chaba in 2004 . That storm caused severe damage and widespread flooding . Unlike Chaba , relatively little rainfall fell due to Choi @-@ wan , and no flooding was reported . The main effects from the typhoon in Saipan were downed trees which littered streets across the islands . Power lines were downed and sewer pipes were broken ; however , crews began repairing damage once Choi @-@ wan passed . In <unk> , the major shelter on the island sustained minor damage and repair work on it would take roughly a week . 
 On Alamagan , residents attempted to contact officials on other islands on September 17 . Despite the extreme intensity of the storm , all sixteen residents on the island , including the 4 @-@ day old infant were safe . During their attempted contact , the connection was poor and hard to understand . The following day , the United States Navy sent a ship and helicopter to the island to assess the situation . The Navy stated that the entire island of Alamagan was a total loss , with all but one of the structures , a facility for laboratory and research , completely destroyed and most of the islands ' trees downed . 
 Once on the island , they determined that all residents needed to be evacuated " ... whether they like or not " . The first to be evacuated from the island were the infant and six people in the family ; the infant was taken to a hospital on Saipan as a precaution . On nearby Agrihan , it was determined that the residents on the island also needed to be evacuated . Prior to their evacuations , they were given relief supplies , mainly food and water , to survive for five days . Roughly 260 gallons of fresh water , 50 lbs of rice and other health or comfort supplies were delivered by Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 25 to both islands . On September 21 , the Salvation Army announced that residents displaced by the storm would be received donated items , such as clothing , toys , pillows and baby formula . 
 = Russian battleship Retvizan = 
 Retvizan ( Russian : <unk> ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built before the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 for the Imperial Russian Navy . She was built by the American William Cramp and Sons because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity . Named after a Swedish ship of the line that was captured during the battle of Vyborg Bay in 1790 ( Swedish : <unk> , meaning both fairness and justice ) , Retvizan was briefly assigned to the Baltic Fleet , but was transferred to the Far East in 1902 . 
 The ship was torpedoed during the Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur during the night of 8 / 9 February 1904 and grounded in the harbour entrance when she attempted to take refuge inside , as her draft had significantly deepened from the amount of water she had taken aboard after the torpedo hit . She was refloated and repaired in time to join the rest of the 1st Pacific Squadron when they attempted to reach Vladivostok through the Japanese blockade on 10 August . The Japanese battle fleet engaged them again in the Battle of the Yellow Sea , forcing most of the Russian ships to return to Port Arthur after their squadron commander was killed and his flagship damaged . Retvizan was sunk by Japanese howitzers in December after the Japanese gained control of the heights around the harbour . 
 The Japanese raised and repaired Retvizan after Port Arthur surrendered in January 1905 . She was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Hizen ( <unk> ) in 1908 . Based in Sasebo when the Japanese declared war on Germany in 1914 , the ship was sent to reinforce the weak British squadron off British Columbia , but diverted to Hawaii after reports of a German gunboat there . Hizen was unsuccessfully sent to search for other German ships after the Americans interned the gunboat in November . After World War I she supported the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War and was disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . The ship was sunk as a gunnery target in 1924 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Tsar Nicholas II had desired a warm @-@ water port on the Pacific since his accession to the throne in 1894 . He achieved this ambition in March 1898 when Russia signed a 25 @-@ year lease for Port Arthur and the <unk> Peninsula with China . Japan had previously forced China to sign over the port and its surrounding territory as part of the treaty that concluded the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 , but the Triple Intervention of France , Russia , and Germany forced them to return the port in exchange for a sizeable increase in the indemnity paid by the Chinese . Japan invested much of the indemnity money in expanding its fleet , while Russia began a major building programme ( " For the Needs of the Far East " ) to defend its newly acquired port . 
 Russian shipyards were already at maximum capacity so the Naval Ministry decided to order ships from abroad . Charles Henry Cramp , the owner and son of the founder of William Cramp and Sons in Philadelphia , had a relationship with the Imperial Russian Navy dating back to the late 1870s when his firm built the auxiliary cruisers Afrika , Asia , Europa and <unk> . Cramp also repaired several Russian warships visiting America in 1893 , and he cultivated the contacts he made in the Russian Navy throughout the 1890s . As such , he was ideally positioned to offer to build a battleship for the Russians in his shipyard when they began to look abroad . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Preliminary design work on a battleship intended to equal the latest Japanese ships was begun over the winter of 1897 – 98 by the Naval Technical Committee although the displacement was limited to 12 @,@ 000 long tons ( 12 @,@ 193 t ) for economic reasons . The basic design was that of the Peresvet class with its speed increased to 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) using only two shafts and its steaming range increased to 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 800 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The Naval Ministry intended to conduct an international design competition with the ships being built abroad as the Baltic shipyards were at full capacity already . 
 Cramp 's contacts kept him informed of the Russians ' intentions and he sailed to Saint Petersburg to offer his services and design expertise in March 1898 . Initially Cramp offered American designs to the Russians , including an updated version of USS Iowa as it was a relatively close match for the Russian specification , but the Russians preferred their own designs . Both sides compromised and the final design was based on the Russian battleship Potemkin . The new ship had four fewer 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns , but twice the coal capacity for improved range and a longer , slightly narrower hull for more speed . The contract was signed on 23 April 1898 for a price of $ 4 @,@ 360 @,@ 000 . The protected cruiser Varyag was ordered at the same time for $ 2 @,@ 138 @,@ 000 .

Her hull was subdivided by fourteen transverse watertight bulkheads ; in addition a longitudinal centreline bulkhead divided the engine room . Retvizan had a complete double bottom that extended up the side to the lower edge of the armour deck . She had a metacentric height of 3 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 0 m ) . Her crew consisted of 23 officers and 722 enlisted men .

 Retvizan had two three @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines with a total designed output of 16 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 931 kW ) . The Russian Navy preferred to use Belleville boilers , but Cramp pressed for Niclausse boilers , not least because he was the American agent for them , and was supported by the General Admiral Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich . Twenty @-@ four Niclausse @-@ type boilers provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of 18 standard atmospheres ( 1 @,@ 824 kPa ; 265 psi ) .

Not surprisingly , Cramp claimed that she reached 18 @.@ 01 knots to avoid contractual penalties . Following Retvizan 's arrival in Russia , the propeller pitch was adjusted and she exceeded 18 knots . She carried a normal load of 1 @,@ 016 long tons ( 1 @,@ 032 t ) of coal that provided a range of 4 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 100 km ; 5 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) and a maximum load of 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 000 t ) that gave 8 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 000 km ; 9 @,@ 200 mi ) at the same speed . 
 = = = Armament and fire control = = = 
 Retvizan 's armament was built by the Obukhov Works in Saint Petersburg and shipped to America for installation . The main armament consisted of two pairs of 12 @-@ inch 40 @-@ calibre guns mounted in French @-@ style electrically @-@ operated centre @-@ pivot twin turrets fore and aft . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 15 ° and could depress to -5 ° . The ship carried 77 rounds per gun and the guns could fire one round every 80 to 90 seconds . They fired a 730 @-@ pound ( 330 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 592 ft / s ( 790 m / s ) to a range of 12 @,@ 000 yards ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 Eight of the twelve 45 @-@ calibre 6 @-@ inch Canet Pattern 1892 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns were mounted in casemates on the main deck while four were mounted on the upper deck . They fired shells that weighed 91 @.@ 3 lb ( 41 @.@ 4 kg ) with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 610 ft / s ( 800 m / s ) . They had a maximum range of around 12 @,@ 000 yards ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) and could fire three to five rounds per minute . The guns were provided with 200 rounds each . 
 The ship carried many smaller guns to defend itself against attack by torpedo boats . The largest of these were twenty QF 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) Canet Pattern 1892 guns . Fourteen of these were in embrasures on the main deck and six were mounted on the upper deck , between the six @-@ inch casemates . Each gun was provided with 325 rounds . They fired an 11 @-@ pound ( 4 @.@ 9 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ( 820 m / s ) to a maximum range of 7 @,@ 005 yards ( 6 @,@ 405 m ) . The rate of fire was between twelve and fifteen rounds per minute . A total of twenty @-@ four 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns were carried ; four in each fighting top and eight at each end of the superstructure . They fired a 3 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 100 ft / s ( 650 m / s ) . Six 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the bridge wings . They fired a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 540 ft / s ( 470 m / s ) . 
 Retvizan carried six 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes . Four were above water , one each in the bow and stern and the aft pair of broadside tubes ; the forward broadside tubes were underwater . A total of 17 torpedoes were carried . The ship was designed to carry two second @-@ class torpedo boats each equipped with a single torpedo tube and a small quick @-@ firing gun . The ship could also carry 45 mines . 
 The ship was fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship , usually the waterline and the crow 's nest , to estimate the range . The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target . He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro @-@ mechanical fire @-@ control transmission system to each gun or turret .

 The total weight of the Krupp armour was 3 @,@ 300 long tons ( 3 @,@ 353 t ) or 25 @.@ 8 % of the displacement . The armour was mostly made in the United States , although a contract was let for deck armour from Russia on 6 January 1899 . The main waterline belt had a maximum thickness of 9 inches ( 229 mm ) and tapered to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick at its lower edge . It was 256 feet ( 78 @.@ 0 m ) long and 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) high , of which about 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) was above the waterline . The 6 @-@ inch upper belt was as long as the main belt and was 7 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) high . Armour plates 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick protected the ends of the ship to a height equal to that of the main and upper belts combined . Bulkheads 7 inches ( 177 @.@ 8 mm ) thick provided transverse protection for the ship 's vitals . The lower casemate armour was 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick and armour screens 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick separated each gun . The upper casemate armour consisted of five inches of armour plate with semicircular 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch thick gun shields enclosing the guns . 
 The front and sides of the turrets were 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick with 2 @-@ inch roofs . Their barbettes were 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick above the upper deck , but diminished to 4 inches ( 102 mm ) below it . The conning tower and its communication tube had 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) walls . The armour deck inside the central citadel was level with the top of the main belt and sloped down to meet the lower edge of the main belt . It was two inches thick on the flat and 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) on the slope . Fore and aft of the citadel the deck thickened to 3 inches ( 76 mm ) to the ends of the ship and reinforced the ram bow .

 Named after the Swedish ship of the line <unk> ( Justice ) which was captured by the Russians at the Battle of Viborg Bay in 1790 , Retvizan was ordered on 2 May 1898 for delivery in thirty months . The detailed sketch design was forwarded at the end of 1898 to Saint Petersburg for approval and work commenced on the ship around that time , although she was not officially laid down until 29 July 1899 as yard number 300 . Construction was delayed by a strike at the shipyard that began in August 1899 and continued until the strike collapsed in early 1900 . Other delays were caused by differences between American and Russian shipbuilding techniques and the insistence of the Naval Ministry on approving any design changes even though a Russian commission had been sent to Philadelphia to supervise her construction . 
 Her armament arrived in Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation , which required Cramp 's electricians to piece things together themselves , for which Cramp charged an extra $ 50 @,@ 000 . She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901 . The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before he received his last payment . More work needed to be done on the armament , but it had to wait until she arrived in Russia . Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902 , under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service . 
 Retvizan sailed for the Baltic Sea on 13 May 1902 and stopped to re @-@ coal in Cherbourg , France en route . After leaving Cherbourg a boiler tube burst on 14 June , scalding six stokers , three of them fatally . After her arrival she was fitted with radio equipment and took part in a naval review in Reval staged for the state visit of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany in August . Later that month she tested an experimental system for coaling at sea ; it was deemed successful , but her equipment was removed before she sailed for the Pacific . Retvizan departed on 13 November 1902 in company with the battleship Pobeda and the cruisers Diana , Pallada and Bogatyr ; she arrived at Port Arthur on 4 May 1903 .

 The Pacific Squadron began mooring in the outer harbour at night as tensions with Japan increased , in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea . Both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control both Manchuria and Korea which naturally caused problems between them . A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 . Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901 , but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems . Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs . The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea . These caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable . 
 Retvizan was on searchlight duty on the night of 8 / 9 February 1904 and attracted many torpedoes during the Japanese surprise attack that night . She was hit on the port side forward by a torpedo which blew a 220 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 20 m2 ) hole in her side . Five men in the torpedo compartment were killed and all electrical power was knocked out . The ship took on enough water to give her a list of 11 ° ; this was reduced to 5 ° by counter @-@ flooding . A sail was used to cover the hole and steam was raised so she could head for the inner harbour . The 2 @,@ 200 long tons ( 2 @,@ 235 t ) of water she had taken aboard had increased her draft enough to cause her to ground in the harbour entrance . She was not refloated until 8 March , but played an important role in the meantime in defeating a Japanese attempt to seal the entrance with block ships on 23 – 24 February . Repairs began immediately after she was towed into the harbour and were completed on 3 June although no docks were available and a cofferdam had to be built . She sailed with the rest of the Russian squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok . Vice Admiral Vitgeft returned to Port Arthur when he encountered the Japanese fleet , led by Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō , shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage the numerically superior Japanese in a night battle . 
 During the summer , Retvizan landed two 6 @-@ inch , two 47 mm and six 37 mm guns to reinforce the landward defences of the port . She was hit on 9 August by seven 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) shells fired by a battery with a narrow view of the harbour . Schensnovich was slightly wounded , a barge adjacent to the ship was sunk and she was holed below the waterline . The ship took on a 1 ° list from 400 long tons ( 410 t ) of water , which was corrected by counter @-@ flooding . The holes were patched , although the water was not pumped out , and she sailed the next day with the fleet in another attempt to reach Vladivostok . This sortie resulted in the Battle of the Yellow Sea .

 The battle began as a long @-@ range gunnery duel , during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage . Over two hours after the start of the battle , the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17 : 35 . Forty minutes later a shell struck Retzivan 's forward turret near the gun ports , killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure . The impact knocked one 12 @-@ inch shell off its loading tray , crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports . Fearing that the fire might spread , the surviving crewmen flooded the turret , knocking out its electrical system . The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour . 
 At approximately 18 : 40 hours on 10 August , during the final phase of the battle , the Russian flagship Tsesarevich was hit by 12 @-@ inch shells which killed Admiral Vitgeft and his immediate staff . The Russian battleship was turning out of control , disrupting the Russian formation . As the Japanese pre @-@ dreadnoughts continued to pound the Tsesarevich with their 12 @-@ inch fire , Retzivan 's captain boldly charged Tōgō 's battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire onto his ship . The Japanese battle line immediately shifted their fire onto the oncoming Retzivan , firing so many shells that they were unable to adjust their fire due to the number of shell splashes engulfing the Russian battleship . As the Russian squadron was now disorganized , Tōgō 's battleships were running low on ammunition and some ships ' main guns were disabled , he turned the battle over to his cruisers and destroyers . Retzivan had effectively ended the duel between the opposing fleets , and had saved Tsesarevich from destruction . During the battle , Retvizan received 18 hits from large @-@ calibre shells , and suffered 6 sailors killed and another 42 men wounded , including Schensnovich . 
 She was subsequently besieged in Port Arthur and sunk in shallow water by thirteen 28 @-@ centimeter ( 11 in ) howitzer shells on 6 December 1904 after the Imperial Japanese Army gained control of the heights surrounding the harbour . Schensnovich was the senior surviving naval officer and signed the capitulation of Port Arthur for the Imperial Russian Navy on 2 January 1905 .
