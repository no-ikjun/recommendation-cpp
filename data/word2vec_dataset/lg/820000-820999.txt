 Laucke 's classical / flamenco musical style is a blend of his classical studies with Bream , Segovia , Valdès @-@ Blain , and his friendship with de Lucía . Although classical and flamenco guitar are two quite different musical styles , Québec 's French @-@ language newspaper Le Soleil chronicled Laucke 's feelings and reasoning about performing both . 
 Since the classical guitar is limited , you eventually look for something else . I was doing flamenco , and I love it . There are more varied techniques in flamenco ; just in the right hand alone , we have 20 of them . 
 I would like flamenco to become the new jazz ! Flamenco has everything that it takes to follow in the footsteps of jazz and become a language to people of all countries and all cultures . We forget that before being a universal language , jazz was only the mode of expression of blacks in New Orleans ! Like jazz , flamenco is based on improvisation and dialogue between instrumentalists . And flamenco is something even more , since players also interact with the dancers . 
 ( English translation ) 
 His blend of the classical and flamenco styles , sometimes referred to as " new flamenco " ( nuevo flamenco ) , led music critic Eric McLean of the Montreal Gazette to proclaim : " It is Laucke 's interest in flamenco that makes him special : He might be called the first interpreter of flamenco music , in the sense that he borrows these traditional works by Sabicas , Carlos Montoya and Paco de Lucía , and employs them in his own fashion , a practice to which they agree . " Laucke summarized : " The Spanish guitar remains my first love . The flamenco guitar is my passion . " According to The Music Scene magazine published by Society of Composers , Authors and Music Publishers of Canada ( SOCAN ) , he is one of " five of Canada 's best @-@ known soloists " and the Canadian federal and provincial governments gave him " full recognition as the person who has done more for the guitar in this country than anyone else " .

 In the 1970s , Laucke moved to New York City to further his career . He was asked by Valdès @-@ Blain if he would mind sharing his one @-@ room apartment with flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía . Laucke taught de Lucía music by Bach and Villa @-@ Lobos . In return , de Lucía showed Laucke some of the secrets of his art of flamenco , an oral tradition handed down through generations , " their secrets and knowledge jealously guarded " . Although Laucke had played flamenco for his own pleasure since he was a child , he had never felt comfortable playing it in public . De Lucía 's influence helped change this : " This meeting changed my life , " Laucke declared , " he taught me flamenco works which were not written anywhere and to which no other guitarist had access . So for me to be taught all these techniques by a guitarist of Paco 's caliber was an incredible stroke of luck " . ( English translation ) 
 In an interview with the Montreal Gazette , Laucke stated : " [ de Lucía ] was the greatest natural talent I have ever come across . " At the time , Laucke was impressed by a piece called Entre dos aguas ( Between Two Seas ) that de Lucía was creating , which has become arguably his best @-@ known composition . Since de Lucía did not read music , Laucke offered to teach him but he refused . When the question arose as to whether Laucke would ever play de Lucía 's compositions in public , he advised Laucke , " you must do it in your own style " . 
 He teamed up again with de Lucía to give a series of concerts combining the two repertoires . Many newspapers talked about this association . The Canadian Spanish magazine El Popular stated : " Laucke is convinced that flamenco possesses enormous seductive powers . ' The harmonies and the rhythm leave no one indifferent ' , says Laucke . " 
 The meeting with de Lucía led Laucke to perform two incompatible guitar styles . In 1991 , he recorded compositions de Lucía taught him on the album Spanish Guitar Stories . De Lucía expressed his approval , saying the album was : " very beautiful , all of it , from a to z , even my pieces ! " 
 = = = Flamenco Road album = = = 
 On 12 September 2001 , Laucke released a CD called Flamenco Road , consisting mainly of his own compositions in the new flamenco style , which he also arranged . In an interview for <unk> magazine , Laucke stated : " It is also very influenced by my classical background . So it 's a smoother flamenco . " An example of this style from the album can be heard in Laucke 's treatment of the well @-@ known classical guitar transcription " Leyenda " , which is given a flamenco rendition using several percussion instruments ( claves , maracas , special castanets mounted on wood blocks , chimes , and a large gong ) , bass , and flute . 
 Ten works were recorded at five different studios in Montreal , each chosen for its unique acoustics . The instrumentation for the recording 's title piece , " Flamenco Road " , required the use of 24 tracks . It comprises a combination of four types of guitars — flamenco , Spanish , classical , and electric — and all natural acoustic guitars are played the Spanish way , using all the fingers of the right hand without a pick . The rhythm section includes bongos , four congas , and a rock drum set blended with other percussion instruments such as claves , maracas , and castanets . It further incorporates three dancers performing typical " <unk> " ( hand @-@ clapping ) in synchronization , as well as three trumpets , three pianos , and a " country @-@ style " violinist . 
 The enhanced CD includes two videos : one with interactive live concert footage filmed during Laucke 's tenth season at Montreal ’ s Place des Arts , and the other with the video clip of " Flamenco Road " . The latter reached number one on video charts across Canada for five consecutive weeks .

 SOCAN lists 112 classical works transcribed for the guitar by Laucke , illustrating the extent to which he has broadened the guitar 's repertoire in music of the Renaissance , classical , baroque , and romantic eras , as well as in flamenco . Library and Archives Canada and Canadian Libraries list 43 music recordings , music scores of transcriptions for guitar and Canadian guitar articles written by Laucke . Waterloo Music Company published and distributed 24 of Laucke 's guitar transcriptions of works by J. S. Bach , Luis de Narváez , Eric Satie , Heitor Villa @-@ Lobos and others . 
 = = = = Trois Gymnopédies by Eric Satie = = = = 
 While living in Greenwich Village , New York , in the early 1970s , Laucke became interested in the French music of Eric Satie , " the world 's first hippie " . At that time , only simplified arrangements of Trois Gymnopédies ( Three Gymnopédies ) existed for the guitar , so Laucke set out to transcribe Satie 's three works from the piano score . Determined to fit all of the notes from the original piano version using the guitar 's six strings , over the course of three weeks he calculated the number of times open strings would occur per note . 
 In 1979 , Laucke signed with the Waterloo Music Publishing Company , which that year published the sheet music of his transcription of Trois Gymnopédies , the first of many of his transcriptions to be published by Waterloo and arguably the only version for guitar to include all of the notes of the original piano composition . In 1985 , the company created The Michael Laucke Series of guitar arrangements and transcriptions . 
 In the introductory notes to his sheet music for Trois Gymnopédies , Laucke comments : " The characteristic harmonies of much of the music of Erik Satie belong to the impressionist period and , though originally written for the piano , are extremely well @-@ suited to the natural idiomatic expression of the guitar . This has led me to make these transcriptions which will enrich the repertoire of the guitar while remaining faithful to Satie 's intentions . " 
 After giving many concert performances of these works , Laucke recorded them on his CD entitled Flamenco Road which held the number one position on video charts across Canada for six weeks . The liner notes read : " My arrangements of ' The [ sic ] Three Gymnopédies ' comprise ALL the notes of the original piano versions : a most complex process since all the piano sounds must fit comfortably , or uncomfortably , onto the six strings of the guitar . " He continues to say : " The present recording is done as it is in concert , on one classical guitar , without overdubbing . My tempo is a little quicker than when the pieces are played on the piano , due to the shorter resonance time of notes played on the Spanish guitar . Now and then , I use a ' vibrato ' and slides , which , of course , can 't be done on the piano but which add warmth of expression to this undeniably charming , exotic and mystic music . " 
 = = = Original works = = = 
 Laucke has had 25 original , Canadian atonal works written for him , among them the Flamenco Concierto for guitar and full symphonic orchestra by Michel @-@ Georges Brégent , Me duele España by François Morel , Exploration by Jean Papineau @-@ Couture and Pour guitare , Claude Vivier 's only work for the guitar . Laucke performed all 25 works in major halls , on CBC radio and on his record albums ; all of them were commissioned by , and dedicated to , Laucke . 
 In 1984 , critics began to take note of the growth of new Canadian guitar works energized by Laucke . In La Presse , a Canadian newspaper , music critic Claude <unk> found in Laucke " an interpreter who could not be more convincing " . Canadian composer Claude Vivier expressed his appreciation to Laucke . In his letters , Vivier states that he had : " hardly ever met a musician as committed and dedicated , of such great quality and , above all , of such great completeness and intense capacity for work " .

 Laucke 's career spans over 50 years , with concert and television appearances in 25 countries , including England ( Wigmore Hall ) , the U.S. ( Carnegie Hall , and the White House ) , as well as China , on the Great Wall of China . Other countries where Laucke performed include Bulgaria , Hungary , Hong Kong , Spain , Israel , India , Japan , Morocco , Pakistan , and Russia . In Canada , he has given annual concerts at Montreal 's Place des Arts since 1986 . Following a concert in 1990 in Quebec City 's Grand Théâtre de Québec , the French @-@ language newspaper Le Soleil wrote a review entitled " Michael Laucke makes one fall in love with the guitar " , stating : " More than a virtuoso , charismatic Michael Laucke is pure talent ! For him playing is instinctive , just like breathing ... irresistible Michael Laucke . " Critics have often written about Laucke 's stage presence . A Chicago music critic described how : " His relaxed manner , beaming smile and gracious speaking voice won the hearts of the audience before he even played a note . " 
 He performed many concerts in Washington , DC , under the auspices of U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell , including several at the National Gallery of Art . The Washington Post proclaimed that Laucke is : " one of the finest guitarists to have played in Washington in a long time . " On another occasion , Laucke gave the premiere of <unk> 's " Version of Sapho , " written for him , an atonal work which received a less favorable critique . The Washington Post stated : " Since the mind can only respond to some sort of form , its essential formlessness precludes discussion . A triad out of the blue signaled the end , which the large audience recognized and applauded . "

 In 1994 , Laucke became a director of the Mac AIDS Fund ( M · A · F ) established by his friend Frank Angelo , the co @-@ founder of MAC Cosmetics . After a fourteen @-@ year tenure , he became honorary charter member of the board of directors and no longer participated in its activities . According to Laucke , MAF 's directors helped coordinate the film Pandemic : Facing AIDS by Rory Kennedy , and MAF became a secondary sponsor while the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation became title sponsor .

 TNA issued a press release in May 2005 announcing that they would be holding a PPV titled Sacrifice on August 14 at the TNA Impact ! Zone in Orlando , Florida . TNA created a section covering the event on their website . TNA released a poster prior featuring Raven and the tagline " Pain " .

Austin Aries , Jay Lethal , and Roderick Strong were the choices in the poll ; Aries won , thus setting up Daniels versus Aries . 
 = = = Storylines = = = 
 Sacrifice featured nine professional wrestling matches and one pre @-@ show match that involved wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds and storylines portraying villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters ; these scripted events built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 The main event at Sacrifice was a Tag Team match between the team of Jeff Jarrett and Rhino and the team of Raven and Sabu . This match was the result of an existing rivalry between Raven and Jarrett over the NWA World Heavyweight Championship which Raven held . At TNA 's previous PPV event No Surrender on July 17 , Raven defeated Abyss in a No Surrender Dog Collar match to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship . After the encounter , Jarrett distracted Raven , allowing Rhino to attack Raven from behind . On the July 22 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! , Jarrett and Rhino claimed that Raven had no allies to help defend himself before they physically assaulted him . Cassidy Riley had previously pledged allegiance to Raven , even aiding Raven in his match at No Surrender . During the July 29 episode of Impact ! , Rhino and Jarrett attacked Riley , believing he would aid Raven in some way . Afterwards , Raven announced he had chosen a partner to team with him to face Jarrett and Rhino at Sacrifice . Sabu then made his TNA return revealing himself as Raven 's partner by attacking Jarrett and Rhino . 
 The Finals of the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament were scheduled for Sacrifice . Over the weeks leading up to Sacrifice on Impact ! , TNA held the eight @-@ man single @-@ elimination tournament to decide which two would compete for the 2005 Super X Cup trophy and who would earn a future TNA X Division Championship match . A.J. Styles , Alex Shelley , Chris Sabin , Matt Bentley , Petey Williams , Samoa Joe , Shocker , and Sonjay Dutt all competed in the tournament . Joe defeated Dutt , Shelley defeated Shocker , Styles defeated Bentley , and Williams defeated Sabin in the Quarterfinals on the respective July 22 and July 29 episodes of Impact ! to advance to the Semifinals . In the Semifinals , Joe defeated Shelley and Styles defeated Williams to advance to the Finals at Sacrifice on the August 5 and August 10 episodes of Impact ! , respectively . With their victories , Joe versus Styles in the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament Final was scheduled for Sacrifice . 
 Jerry Lynn versus Sean Waltman was also promoted for Sacrifice . At No Surrender , Lynn was Special Guest Referee for a bout between Styles and Waltman , which Styles won after aid from Lynn . TNA created a storyline from this and Lynn and Waltman 's past real @-@ life friendship . On the July 22 episode of Impact ! , Waltman accused Lynn of trying to steal his spotlight in a backstage segment , while Lynn took credit for Waltman 's success . Lynn argued that he was the one who helped get Waltman into the industry as well as early success thanks to a critically acclaimed series of matches the two had in the past . The segment ended with Waltman challenging Lynn to a match at Sacrifice , which Lynn accepted . This bout was also promoted as a clash between two pioneers of TNA 's X Division style . 
 At No Surrender , the team of Kip James and Monty Brown fought the 3Live Kru ( Konnan and Ron Killings ) in a Tag Team Street Fight . Brown and Kip won the encounter , however , during the bout Kip assaulted several TNA personnel . As such , a storyline developed in which referees refused to participate in future encounters involving Kip . After a rematch between the two teams was announced for Sacrifice on the July 22 episode of Impact ! , a segment took place between referees Andrew Thomas , Rudy Charles , and Mark " Slick " Johnson and NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko . In the segment , each refused to referee the bout at Sacrifice , telling Zbyszko he would need to find a replacement . Former 3Live Kru member B.G. James was appointed the Special Guest Referee by Zbyszko for the bout at Sacrifice on the July 29 episode of Impact ! .

 TNA held an Eight Man Tag Team match pitting the team of America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ) and The Naturals ( Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens ) , who were accompanied by Jimmy Hart , against Team Canada ( A @-@ 1 , Bobby Roode , Eric Young , and Petey Williams ) . A brawl ensued during the bout after The Naturals performed their signature Natural Disaster tag team maneuver on Young . This resulted in A @-@ 1 , Douglas , Storm , Young , and Williams fighting at the ringside area until Harris jumped off the top of a padded turnbuckle onto the group with a splash . Williams attempted to bash Storm with a hockey stick , but missed allowing Storm to toss him to the floor . Meanwhile , Roode scored the pinfall on Stevens with a small package pin while holding his tights for leverage at 11 minutes and 11 seconds . 
 The Finals of the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament was next between A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe . The duration of the encounter was 15 minutes and 15 seconds .

The winner of this match won the silver Super X Cup trophy and became number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship , earning a title match against Daniels at TNA 's Unbreakable PPV event on September 11 . In the beginning while Styles was laying against the ring ropes , Joe ran across the ring and kicked him in the face , causing him to fly out of the ring and crash against the floor . Joe then followed by diving through the ring ropes and smashing Styles in the face with his forearm once Styles reached his feet . Later , Styles held Joe on his shoulders before twisting him off into a powerbomb for what he calls a Rack Bomb . However , during the move referee Andrew Thomas was knocked unconscious after being kicked in the face , which allowed Daniels to interfere in the contest attacking Styles and attempting to attack Joe with the X Division Title belt before Styles threw Daniels from the ring . Joe followed by lifting Styles up and performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver by slamming Styles back and neck @-@ first into the mat before placing Styles in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold .

Speaking to USA Today , Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna : " It 's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about , you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you , but it might be an idea you have .

 = Braid ( video game ) = 
 Braid is a platform and puzzle video game developed by Number None , Inc . The game was originally released in August 2008 for the Xbox 360 's Xbox Live Arcade service . Ports were developed and released for Microsoft Windows in April 2009 , OS X in May 2009 , PlayStation 3 in November 2009 , and Linux in December 2010 . 
 The basic story elements unfold as the protagonist , Tim , attempts to rescue a princess from a monster . Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative , giving clues about Tim 's contemplations and motivations . The game features traditional aspects of the platform genre while integrating various powers of time @-@ manipulation . Using these abilities , the player progresses by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces . 
 Jonathan Blow designed the game as a personal critique of contemporary trends in game development . He funded the three @-@ year project with his own money . Webcomic artist David Hellman drew the artwork , which underwent several iterations until it satisfied Blow 's vision . A preliminary version of Braid without the final artwork won the " Innovation in Game Design " award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival ; the final version received additional accolades . The game received highly positive reviews from critics , eventually becoming the highest critically rated title on Xbox Live . Some reviewers , however , criticized the game 's price relative to its length . 
 Braid was seen as a keystone title in the growth of indie game development since its 2008 release , and Jonathan Blow and its production were documented in the 2012 film , Indie Game : The Movie . The game , as of 2015 , had total revenue nearing $ 6 million , which Blow used to fund his next game , The Witness . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Braid is played by solving physical puzzles in a standard platform game environment . The player controls the protagonist Tim as he runs , jumps , and climbs across the game 's levels . Tim jumps and stomps on enemies to defeat them , and can collect keys to unlock doors or operate levers to trigger platforms . A defining game element is the player 's unlimited ability to reverse time and " rewind " actions , even after dying . The game is divided into six worlds , which are experienced sequentially and can be entered from different rooms of Tim 's house ; the player can return to any world previously visited to attempt to solve puzzles they missed . 
 Each world has its own time @-@ based game mechanic : 
 2 . Time and Forgiveness plays as an ordinary platform game , except that the player may rewind time to undo their actions . The section includes several challenges that would be unplayable or unfair in an ordinary platform game , but become feasible when the rewind mechanic is available . 
 3 . Time and Mystery introduces objects surrounded by a green glow that are unaffected by time manipulation ; for example , switches will remain flipped even if time is rewound to before the action occurred . <unk> can thus be used to change the synchronization between objects that can and cannot be rewound , the basis of many puzzles in this section . This theme is also used in later worlds to denote objects unaffected by the player 's time manipulation . 
 4 . Time and Place links the passage of time to the player character 's location on the horizontal axis . As the player moves toward the right , time flows forward , while moving toward the left reverses the flow ; standing still or moving vertically will pause time . The player 's location must be carefully managed in relation to enemies and objects . 
 5 . Time and Decision involves a " shadow " of the player character appearing after the player rewinds time and performing the actions that the real player character rewound ; if the timeline expires , the shadow will complete any initiated falls and jumps but will otherwise stand still before disappearing . Things coloured in violet can interact both with the main character and its shadow at the same time . Puzzles in this section revolve around using this mechanic to carry out multiple actions at once . 
 6 . <unk> provides the player with a magic ring which , when dropped , warps the flow of time around itself ; the closer moving objects ( including Tim ) are to it , the slower time passes for them . The regular rewind control remains available . 
 The final world is labeled simply " 1 . " In this world , time flows in reverse . <unk> time returns the flow of time to its normal state . 
 Each stage contains puzzle pieces that must be collected to create jigsaw puzzles that tell the story , and to unlock the last stage . On completing the main game , a <unk> mode becomes available for select levels and the entire game . There are also eight stars hidden throughout the world of Braid that correspond to the stars in the constellation of Andromeda just outside the main character 's house . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Tim is a man searching for a princess who " has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster . " His relationship with this princess is vague at best , and the only clear part of this relationship is that Tim has made some sort of mistake which he hopes to reconcile or , if possible , erase . As one progresses through the six worlds in Braid , storyline text at the beginning of each world provides further insight into Tim 's quest for the princess , and alludes to the overarching gameplay mechanic of each level . The themes evoked include forgiveness , desire , and frustration . The final level , in which everything but Tim moves in reverse , depicts the princess escaping from a knight , and working together with Tim to surpass obstacles and meet at her home . Tim is suddenly locked out of the house , and , as time progresses forward , reversing Tim 's actions , the events show the princess running from Tim , setting traps that he is able to evade , until she is rescued by the knight . Tim is revealed to be the " monster " the princess is running from . 
 Following completion of the game , the player finds additional texts that expand the story . The ending of the game is purposely ambiguous , and has been subject to multiple interpretations . One theory , based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb — " Now we are all sons of bitches " — is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development . Some also refer to the name of the game as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time , demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game . Journalists have considered Braid 's plot to be interwoven with the game itself , much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work 's construction . In this sense , some have considered the game to carry a simple credo , such as " You must look back to go forwards " as suggested by Eurogamer 's Dan Whitehead . Others have likened Braid to punk rock , designed ( as explicitly stated by Blow ) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry ; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts , such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros. , and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design . Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story ; he " would not be capable " of explaining the whole story of the game in words , and said that the central idea is " something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly . " Blow considered Braid to be " about the journey , not the destination " . He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game , seeing it as a way to provide " a longer @-@ term challenge " . 
 = = Development = = 
 Jonathan Blow created Braid as a game that deconstructed current video games trends , " bringing together the abstract parts of a complex puzzle , revealing deep moral and philosophical questions " . Blow came up with the concept of Braid in December 2004 while on a trip to Thailand , and started development work on it in April the following year . By December 2005 , a version of the game was completed that had the same number of worlds and puzzles as the final version , but lacked the final artwork ; this version won the Independent Games Festival game design award at the 2006 Game Developer 's Conference . While working on the art direction , Blow tightened the presentation and mechanics of the puzzles to improve their playability . During the game 's three years of development , Blow put about US $ 200 @,@ 000 of his own money into its development , most going towards hiring of David Hellman for artwork and for living expenses . 
 Originally , Blow had envisioned the game to be broken into several different worlds as in the final game , each exploring facets of space , time , and causality , but with each world having very different high @-@ level mechanics . One mechanic that he could not develop further was a world with no " arrow of time " that would have required the player to traverse the level in a manner that could be repeated in reverse . For example , the player would have been forbidden to jump down from a tall height while moving in forward time , as they would not be able to jump that height in reverse time . While this idea was not used , Blow discovered the rewind feature could be developed further for other aspects . Another game mechanic that Blow considered was to show the player the expected result of an action they would take ; while this concept was informative , he did not find it to be an entertaining game mechanic . Blow had previously explored this in a prototype game called " Oracle Billiards " , the game predicting each billiards shot before it was made . He had found the billiards setting too chaotic for this idea and this led him to try out similar ideas in a simpler " Mario @-@ style " setting . After selecting the game mechanics he wanted , he began adding puzzles that made philosophical points on his views on game design in general . After brainstorming more puzzles and concepts , Blow dropped the least interesting puzzles and worlds from the game . Blow wanted to include significant consequences of rewinding time , not found in games such as Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time , <unk> : the Time Sweeper , and <unk> in which rewinding time creates few or no changes to the game 's world . While these games immerse the player with these time @-@ shifting effects using a first- or third @-@ person perspective , he decided to use a 2D presentation . Blow noted that some of the puzzles in Braid would have been more difficult or impossible to solve in any other perspective . 
 One of Blow 's design goals was to achieve gameplay innovation naturally through the artistic expression of the game . He used Rod Humble 's The Marriage as an example , in which Humble set out to make a game that related his feelings of being in a marriage , instead of developing game concepts first and adding the story later . As such , Blow noted that while there were no new gameplay mechanics , the gameplay felt different from any other game . Another concept that he used for Braid 's development related to the game 's presentation to the player . Blow recognized that many games present a complex interface to the player that get in the way of understanding the game , but at times are needed to explain the game 's rules to draw in players . Blow referenced Jeff Minter 's Space Giraffe , pointing out that the game never communicated the purpose of playing the game upfront to the player , citing that as one of the reasons for the game 's poor reception . Braid was developed to promote this non @-@ verbal communication to the player , explaining the fundamental rule of each world at its start and allow the player to interact with that rule throughout the world . Commenting during the development of his following game , The Witness , Blow noted that he would run into difficulty in demonstrating Braid through video footage alone , as it would not show " what happens in the player 's mind during the puzzle @-@ solving process " , a problem that he had also encountered with The Witness . 
 Blow recognized that the puzzles in Braid had a range of difficulties , with some puzzles being more difficult for certain players than others , and did not have any set difficulty curve . He designed most of the game 's levels to let the player bypass the puzzles , allowing them to experience the rest of the game even if they could not solve a difficult puzzle . Only certain boss fights require the player to defeat the enemy character before continuing on , using a combination of the time mechanics . Blow hoped that players would be able to find solutions to puzzles they had skipped by completing puzzles later in the game . Blow felt that " unearned rewards are false and meaningless " , and thus included collectibles earned only after solving a puzzle . He strongly discouraged players from using a walkthrough to work their way through Braid , instead encouraging players to solve them on their own so that they " will feel very good about " completing the puzzles without help ; Blow created his own official " walkthrough " that guides the player but instead restates his insistence that the player work through the puzzles on their own . Some puzzles pay homage to other video games ; one level features a Donkey Kong @-@ inspired puzzle , and the ending of most worlds tells the player that " the princess is in another castle " , similar to the end of each world in Super Mario Bros. 
 The game 's story was influenced by such works as Italo Calvino 's Invisible Cities , Alan Lightman 's Einstein 's Dreams , Robert A. Heinlein 's The Cat Who Walks Through Walls , and David Lynch 's Mulholland Drive . Specifically , while Blow took the unique narrative model of Invisible Cities , he did not like the homage to it in Einstein 's Dreams , and thus avoided taking the story in that direction . Blow 's goal was that Braid would " be mind @-@ expanding " and that " people [ would ] get experiences from it that they [ had ] not gotten from anything else " . Blow opted to present his story through on @-@ screen text instead of in @-@ game cutscenes , asserting , against criticism of the lack of such cut @-@ scenes , that Braid was " conceived as a videogame with its story presented in the tradition of a few books that I respect " . 
 = = = Artwork = = = 
 The game 's artwork took more than a year to complete . Background artwork for the game went through initial rough color concepts created by Mike <unk> ( creative illustrator and concept artist ) and ultimately the final artwork was created by David Hellman , artist of the critically acclaimed webcomic A Lesson Is Learned but the Damage Is Irreversible . Blow gave Hellman rough images of the level 's layout and told him to draw over it . Hellman and Blow iterated through several styles before settling on final versions . Through these changes , the two worked to identify and remove elements of the art that could confuse the player , while retaining aesthetic elements that would be generalized by the player as non @-@ functional parts of the level . Once the game 's overall artwork was created , Blow and Hellman broke out functional pieces that could be used in Braid 's level editor . As each world was built up using these pieces , Blow suggested more changes that reflected the tone of each world and avoided art that distracted from the gameplay . " Time and Forgiveness " , the first world the player encounters , was drawn to create a feel of exploration and forgiveness , while artwork for " Time and Decision " used a mix of " luxurious domestic objects ( nice furniture and fabrics ) with rugged outdoor objects ( swampy water , rotting piers and nautical rope ) " to create an intentionally " incongruous " look to convey aspects of alternate realities . Several variations on the game 's backgrounds were done until they arrived at the concept of blurring the background elements to make them appear out of focus , while keeping the foreground elements sharply in focus and clear to the player . Particle effects were applied to both background and foreground elements to add apparent motion to them , such as the waving of grass blades or the movement of clouds . The character visuals were originally created by Edmund McMillen , but were later redrawn by Hellman " to better match the now @-@ predominant style of the backgrounds " . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Braid features licensed music from <unk> artists Cheryl Ann Fulton , Shira Kammen and Jami Sieber . Part of Blow 's decision to use licensed music was to reduce development costs . He also felt that those who regularly compose video game music did not have the necessary skills needed to create the mood he wanted for the game . He ultimately selected eight tracks that were sufficiently long to avoid notable looping while a player attempted to solve a difficult puzzle , and that provided a " different and interesting " sound when played in reverse to match the reverse time mechanic of the gameplay . Blow also selected tracks that were " organic and complex " as to help set the game 's mood and aimed " to present something that isn 't necessarily clear @-@ cut " . The selection of the music influenced the creation of the background artwork for the game . Both Kammen and Sieber received favorable feedback from listeners as a result of their works ' inclusion in Braid . <unk> released a soundtrack of the game 's music on April 9 , 2009 , which includes two additional track remixes that incorporate some of the time @-@ shifting elements from the game . The pieces included in Braid are : 
 " <unk> " by Jami Sieber , from Hidden Sky 
 " <unk> " by Jami Sieber , from Lush <unk> 
 " The Darkening Ground " by Jami Sieber , from Lush <unk> 
 " Tell It by Heart " by Jami Sieber , from Second Sight 
 " Long Past Gone " by Jami Sieber , from Second Sight 
 " Downstream " by Shira Kammen , from Music of Waters ( The entire track is actually composed of three pieces of music . The first is " Downstream " itself , composed by Kammen , the second is " O Son do Ar " , composed by <unk> Na <unk> , and the third is Eric <unk> 's " <unk> d <unk> " ) 
 " Lullaby Set " by Shira Kammen and Swan , from Wild Wood 
 " <unk> " by Cheryl Ann Fulton , from The Once and Future Harp 
 = = Release = = 
 Prior to release , Blow withdrew Braid from the 2007 Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition in protest after the controversial Super Columbine Massacre RPG ! was dropped from the competition despite being one of six finalists . Several other developers followed suit and later withdrew their games , including thatgamecompany 's flOw and The Behemoth 's Castle Crashers . 
 Braid was originally developed as a Windows title with possible console versions , though Blow was not committed to releasing either a PC or console version first . Blow signed up with Microsoft to release the game on Xbox Live in mid @-@ 2007 , with that version officially announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show . Blow was critical of the Xbox Live certification process , as he believed the effort to meet all the requirements could have been better spent on polishing the game . At the same time , the certification team allowed him to retain certain aspects of his vision for the game that were otherwise contrary to the process , including giving the player immediate control of the game instead of requiring a start @-@ up title screen . Microsoft also requested that Blow include some additional hints to the player based on results of playtesting , but Blow held his ground , refusing to release the game if he was forced to add these . He said he would likely not release a game again on the Xbox Live service under the same business model . Blow later released a Braid theme for Xbox Live ; though he wanted to release this theme for free , Microsoft required the theme to be priced at a nominal level . 
 The Windows version was originally slated for a late 2008 release but slipped to at least October 2008 . Blow decided to prevent Braid being overwhelmed by a number of large titles that were scheduled for release in late 2008 and pushed the release to early 2009 . The PC version benefited from the work by Blow to create Braid on a standardized platform like the Xbox 360 in order to finish the core game before dealing with various compatibility issues inherent in PC development . Prior to the game 's release for Microsoft Windows , Blow had priced the game at US $ 20 , using pricing models for other games such as World of Goo and Crayon Physics Deluxe . However , this was priced $ 5 more than the Xbox Live version , leading many to criticize his pricing choice . Due to this response , Blow reduced the price to meet the Xbox Live cost , stating that he would " rather have people talking about the game itself " than complaining about its cost . Hothead Games ported Braid to both the PlayStation 3 and Macintosh platforms . A Linux port was done by Ryan C. Gordon and released in December 2010 as part of the second Humble Indie Bundle alongside the Windows and Mac version . It was further added as a bonus to the Humble Indie Bundle V. Blow said that a WiiWare version would not be possible under Nintendo 's current size restrictions . 
 Blow has expressed that he has no current plans to release more levels or make a sequel ; however , he specified that " if another developer out there really likes the time mechanics and wants to make a game that uses them , and perhaps some new ones , with their own new level designs , then hey , awesome . " Shortly after the PC release , Blow released resources for a level editor for Braid that allow users to import new graphics into the game . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Upon its release to Xbox Live Arcade , Braid was met with nearly unanimously positive reviews , with an aggregate review score of 93 % at Metacritic , making it the top @-@ rated Xbox Live Arcade game and the 10th highest @-@ rated Xbox 360 game . Braid was purchased by more than 55 @,@ 000 people during the first week of release . According to Blow , Braid was the second @-@ largest selling Xbox Live Arcade title in 2008 and sales were " very profitable " , making him more money than if he had been working at a high @-@ paying job for the time it took to develop the game . The game had sold 450 @,@ 000 copies by April 2012 . By 2014 , Blow had stated that sales of Braid brought in more than $ 4 million in revenue , much of which he used towards the development of his 2016 game , The Witness . 
 Braid has been considered a masterpiece , and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented . Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation and the need to understand the non @-@ linearity of his actions made him feel as if " years of gaming blinders have been ripped away . " Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were " elaborate and formidable " , but " impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve " , a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Sun 's Paddy Reiley . The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received ; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was " the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you to come to terms with its mature tale the next " . Sam Roberts , game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla <unk> Competition , was impressed that Braid did not " feel immature " as it " expects [ as ] much " of the player as any other form of media and " doesn 't short you in any respect " . Braid 's artwork and presentation were given high regards . Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braid 's artwork " juxtapose old @-@ school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand @-@ painted environments " , while McShea stated that the game 's visuals were " eye @-@ catching but never distracting " . Wired 's Jean Snow wrote that Braid 's " beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision " , and that " the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles " . Arthouse Games ' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability to rewind time indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design : the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game 's " core challenges " . 
 The game was primarily criticized for its short length . IGN 's Hilary Goldstein stated that the game offers " no reason to come back " once you 've completed all the puzzles . However , others compared Braid 's short experience to similar criticisms with Portal in that its length " can be disregarded in the face of its unique approach to storytelling and expansive ideas " . The game 's price was also seen as a negative for the game , though McShea wrote that " Braid is worth every penny " . Blow later said that he expected the price to be US $ 10 , but Microsoft , in promoting the game as part of its Summer of Arcade , made the price $ 15 . Edge also noted that while Blow had tried to integrate the story and gameplay throughout the game , this only worked well in the final world , and otherwise the story was " a little trite in its self @-@ conscious obscurity " . However , others — including new media academics — have disagreed , praising the philosophical complexity of the game , saying " Jonathan Blow 's Braid is the sort of ontological labyrinth that Jorge Luis Borges might have made . Embedded in the simple gameplay design are genuinely huge concepts . " 
 The PC version of the game was considered to be " faithful " to the Xbox 360 version of the game , retaining the same content without adding any new features . Reviewers commented that Braid benefited from keyboard controls . However , as a port of the Xbox 360 version , the lack of initial support for optimizing the graphics display for one 's computer , either through larger screen resolutions or turning off certain game effects , was seen as a drawback , though it is expected that patches will be released to add these options . Both the PlayStation 3 and Macintosh ports of the game by Hothead Games were found to be easily accessible on the system and retained all the innovation and challenge of the original Xbox Live game .

 In addition to winning the Independent Games Festival award in 2006 during its design , Braid was selected by GameSpot for their 2008 awards in " Best Original Downloadable Console Game " , " Best Platformer " , and " Best Licensed Music " , and by Official Xbox Magazine for their 2008 awards of " Xbox Live Arcade Game of the Year " , " Best Soundtrack " , and " Best Ending " and one of their " <unk> Incredible Runners @-@ ups to Game of the Year " . Braid was awarded the " Casual Game of the Year " at the 12th Annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Awards . Braid was nominated for five Xbox Live Arcade 2008 awards , winning one award in the category of " Best Innovation " . MacWorld included Braid in its 2009 Game Hall of Fame . IGN named Braid the 8th best Xbox Live Arcade game in a September 2010 listing .

 Developers have cited Braid as an influence on their game design ; The Guardian considered the game as the " Sex , Lies , and Videotape " of indie gaming , a potent symbol for the saleable potential of non @-@ mainstream productions " . Japanese video game developer Goichi " Suda51 " Suda , developer of killer7 and No More Heroes , stated that playing Braid made him want to try making a 2D title . Tim can be unlocked as a playable character in Super Meat Boy , a game designed by independent game developer Edmund McMillen who had previously created Gish and the original character designs for Braid . Braid has also garnered academic interest and acclaim for its complexity , with <unk> saying " Anyone who thinks ... the unique constraints of game play cannot possibly be used to best structure a story has probably not encountered Braid , which marries pure mechanics and story into a philosophical platform . " Braid 's use of narrative elements and puzzle @-@ making has been compared to similar techniques of " imperative storytelling " in novels such as Life A User 's Manual and Through the Looking @-@ Glass . 
 Braid is considered a title that launched wide interest in independently @-@ developed video games starting around 2008 and onward . <unk> Bearman for the New York Times called Braid the " Easy Rider moment " , showcasing how a small developer can be as successful as a large one , while Sam Machkovech for Ars Technica compared the game to The Beach Boys ' Pet Sounds , a transformative work in the genre that used familiar elements in a new manner . Braid , along with Jonathan Blow 's insight on the game , was featured in Indie Game : The Movie . 
 = Edmund Herring = 
 Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Francis Herring , KCMG , KBE , DSO , MC , KStJ , ED , KC ( 2 September 1892 – 5 January 1982 ) was a senior Australian Army officer during the Second World War , Lieutenant Governor of Victoria , and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria . A Rhodes scholar , Herring was at New College , Oxford , when the First World War broke out and served with the Royal Field Artillery on the Macedonian front , for which he was awarded the Military Cross and Distinguished Service Order . After the war he carved out a successful career as a barrister and King 's Counsel . He also joined the Australian Army , rising to the rank of colonel by 1939 . 
 During the Second World War , Herring commanded the 6th Division Artillery in the Western Desert Campaign and the Battle of Greece . In 1942 , as a corps commander , he commanded the land forces in the Kokoda Track campaign . The following year , he directed operations at Lae and Nadzab . Herring left his corps to become the longest @-@ serving Chief Justice and Lieutenant Governor of Victoria , serving for three decades . In the latter capacity , he was patron of many charitable organisations . 
 = = Education and early life = = 
 Edmund Francis Herring , known as Ned to his family , was born in Maryborough , Victoria , on 2 September 1892 , the third of five children of Edmund Selwyn Herring , a solicitor , and his Irish @-@ born wife Gertrude Stella Herring , formerly <unk> . He was educated at Maryborough College and High School and at Melbourne Grammar , where he excelled at tennis and cricket , and was both School Captain and Dux in 1910 . While at Melbourne Grammar , he served in the Commonwealth Cadet Corps , reaching the rank of sergeant . 
 In 1911 , Herring entered Trinity College , the Church of England residential college at the University of Melbourne , where he played cricket and tennis . In 1912 , he won a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford in England . There , he joined the Officers Training Corps in 1913 . In November of that year he enlisted as a trooper in King Edward 's Horse , a cavalry unit in the British Army . 
 = = First World War = = 
 King Edward 's Horse was mobilised in August 1914 , but was not immediately sent overseas . In December 1914 , Herring was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery , and was posted to B Battery , 99th Field Artillery Brigade of the British 22nd Division . The division moved to the Western Front in August 1915 , but was there only a month before being transferred to the Macedonian front , where it served for the rest of the war . 
 In the Battle of Doiran in April 1917 , Herring served as an artillery observer , directing artillery fire in support of the 22nd Division 's attack from a front line observation post on Pip Ridge . There was a furious artillery duel . Twenty minutes after Captain Thomas Winwood took Herring 's place as forward observer , the observation post took a direct hit from an enemy shell , killing Winwood . Herring succeeded Winwood as battery captain , and was promoted to acting captain in April 1917 . For his " conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty " under heavy shellfire , Herring received an immediate award of the Military Cross . 
 After three years ' service , Herring was granted three weeks ' leave in Australia in October 1917 . He returned to Maryborough , where he met Mary Ranken Lyle , the daughter of the mathematical physicist Thomas Lyle , then a medical student at the University of Melbourne , on New Year 's Day 1918 . The two became constant companions and agreed to correspond regularly . 
 Herring departed for Salonika in February , returning to duty there in March 1918 , and was promoted to acting major on 24 October 1918 on assuming command of B Battery , 99th Field Artillery Brigade . For his service as a battery commander , he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order . He reverted to lieutenant on ceasing to command the battery on 22 January 1919 . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 When the war ended , Herring wished to return to Australia and see Mary before resuming his studies at the University of Oxford in October 1919 . Mary wrote back pointing out the impracticality of this idea ; while she would be disappointed not to see him , he should remain in England and complete his course at Oxford first . The university had awarded him a wartime Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) degree in 1915 ; the Rhodes Scholarship Trust allowed him to resume his scholarship , and he studied for a Bachelor of Civil Law ( BCL ) degree . Since it had been five years since he had been awarded his BA , he was entitled to a MA as well , and graduated with both degrees in July 1920 . After a holiday in Britain and France with his sister Kathleen , he arrived back in Melbourne on 26 November 1920 . 
 Herring was admitted to practice in Victoria as a barrister and solicitor on 1 March 1921 and signed the roll of counsel of the Victorian Bar on 8 June of that year , while Mary graduated with her Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery ( MB BS ) and became a resident surgeon at Royal Melbourne Hospital . The two were married on 6 April 1922 , and had three daughters , Mary Cecile ( Molly ) , born in 1924 , Judith Ann ( Judy ) , born in 1926 , and Margaret Lyle , born in 1933 . Herring worked as a barrister , and lectured in law at the University of Melbourne . He became a King 's Counsel on 25 February 1936 . Mary worked as a physician at antenatal clinics . 
 Herring joined the Australian Army on 1 October 1922 as a legal staff officer in the part @-@ time militia , with the rank of captain . On 1 August 1923 he transferred to Australian Field Artillery . He was promoted to major on 1 July 1925 , lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1929 , and temporary colonel on 1 August 1939 , commanding the 3rd Division Artillery . 
 Herring was involved in politics throughout the 1930s . He was elected to the Melbourne Club in 1927 , a year before Sir Thomas Lyle became its president . He joined the Young Nationalists , an organisation founded by Robert Menzies and Wilfrid Kent Hughes . Along with many senior army and ex @-@ army officers , he was also a member of the clandestine far @-@ right wing paramilitary organisation known as the White Guard , White Army or League of National Security . Composed primarily of former soldiers , the White Guard saw themselves as defenders of order who stood ready to stop a Catholic or Communist revolution in the wake of an emergency like the 1923 Victorian Police strike . After failing to gain United Australia Party preselection for the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Prahran in 1931 , he ran as an unendorsed candidate ( i.e. one lacking formal political endorsement ) for the seat of Brighton in 1936 . He gained 12 @,@ 258 votes , losing by just 528 . Herring also joined the Christian service organisation Toc H in 1925 and became its Victorian Area Commissioner in 1936 . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 On 6 October 1939 , Herring was informed that Major General Sir Thomas Blamey had decided to appoint him as Commander , Royal Artillery , of the 6th Division , of the new Second Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) being raised for service overseas . A week later , Herring was promoted to substantive colonel and temporary brigadier , and given the AIF serial number <unk> . His first task was to organise his new command , which was equipped with World War I vintage 18 pounder guns and 4 @.@ 5 inch howitzers . Herring left for Palestine on 15 April 1940 , along with the 6th Division 's commander , Major General Iven Mackay and his headquarters . Training was difficult as the old ammunition was in short supply . His command was only partially reequipped with the new 25 pounders before being committed to the Western Desert Campaign in December 1940 . 
 = = = Western desert = = = 
 At the Battle of Bardia , Herring controlled all 120 guns used in the division 's attack , in which the infantry were supported by Great @-@ War @-@ style barrages . After the victory at Bardia , Herring 's gunners supported the attack on Tobruk . More than half of his guns were British , and some were commanded by regular British officers who were sceptical of the ability of an Australian Militia officer . War Correspondent Chester Wilmot noted that : 
 Herring has a quiet , easy manner and his last war service has given him an understanding of the British to which they were quick to respond . After Bardia and Tobruk those officers who had been most skeptical were his strongest champions . In building up the artillery plan , Herring brought to bear the same thorough , relentless logic and attention to detail with which he had so often built up a legal argument . 
 = = = Greece = = = 
 In the campaign in Greece , Herring had , in addition to his own gunners , the 2nd Regiment , Royal Horse Artillery , 64th Medium Regiment , Royal Artillery and , for a time , the 6th Field Regiment , Royal New Zealand Artillery , under his command . His Australian , New Zealand and British gunners demonstrated " the extent to which , in such rugged country , artillery , with reliable infantry ahead , could halt and confuse a pursuer " but they were unable to stop the enemy advance . 
 Herring was ordered to evacuate from Greece . He was one of between 7 @,@ 000 and 8 @,@ 000 troops that gathered at Nafplion on 24 April 1941 , although transportation had been arranged for only 5 @,@ 000 . The ship that he was to sail on , the Ulster Prince ran aground near the harbour entrance . She was refloated but then ran aground again near the wharf . Despite this , some 6 @,@ 600 men and women were embarked . Herring and fellow Brigadier Clive Steele were among 5 @,@ 100 that managed to reach Crete on the Royal Navy transport HMS Glenearn . From there they flew back to Alexandria . Others were transported by HMS Phoebe , HMS Hyacinth , HMAS Stuart and HMAS Voyager , which carried 150 Australian and New Zealand nurses . For his service in Libya and Greece , Herring was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) . 
 = = = Defence of Australia = = = 
 Herring was promoted to the temporary rank of major general on 14 August 1941 when he took over command of the 6th Division . He returned to Australia with it in March 1942 . Unaware that the government had already decided that General Sir Thomas Blamey should be appointed Commander in Chief , Herring , along with Major General George Alan Vasey and Brigadier Clive Steele , approached Army Minister Frank Forde with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General Horace Robertson appointed Commander in Chief . The ' revolt of the generals ' collapsed with the announcement that General Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander in Chief , but seems to have done the participants no harm . 
 In Blamey 's reorganisation of the Army in April 1942 , Herring was given command of Northern Territory Force . At this time Darwin was being subjected to Japanese air raids . As supply by sea or air was impractical , Herring developed a land line of communications running across the outback from Alice Springs . 
 On 14 August 1942 , Herring was ordered to Esk , Queensland , to assume command of II Corps with the temporary rank of Lieutenant General . As such , he was responsible for the defence of Brisbane . At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an Intermediate Certificate . There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued , but the allegation reflected a suspicion that Herring was an elitist . 
 = = = Papuan campaign = = = 
 In the wake of the dismissal of Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell for insubordination , Blamey ordered Herring to join him in Port Moresby as the new commander of I Corps . Before departing , Herring met with General Douglas MacArthur , who emphasised that the first duty of a soldier was obedience to his superiors . 
 As at Darwin , Herring 's primary difficulty was logistics . The troops on the Kokoda Track had to be supplied from Port Moresby either by air or by Papuan native carriers who lugged stores over the track on their backs . MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command ( COSC ) , an unusual combined Australian @-@ American logistical organisation , under U.S. Brigadier General Dwight Johns , who in turn was answerable to Herring . Herring backed a plan to take American engineers off working on the airstrips in order to develop the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island , the successful completion of which doubled the port 's capacity and was the logistical turning point of the campaign . 
 More controversial was Herring 's relief of Brigadier Arnold Potts and Blamey 's of Major General Arthur Samuel Allen at Herring 's urging . Herring acknowledged that the two men had faced a difficult task but felt that they were tired and that Brigadier Ivan Dougherty and Major General Vasey could do better . Supporters of Allen , who left school at age 14 , saw this as the action of an autocratic elitist who " ran his staff as he had controlled junior counsel in his barrister 's chamber ; they did his bidding , his way , or were forthwith dispensed with " . 
 In a letter to Herring in 1959 , General Robert L. Eichelberger ( who had himself relieved two division commanders – Major Generals Edwin F. Harding and Horace H. Fuller ) had this to say about the matter : 
 It is a funny thing about war historians . If a general dismisses a subordinate at any time he is immediately attacked ; whereas in our football game , if you have a better player for a particular place , you always play him , and everybody expects you to do this . I have little doubt that the same is true of your ball game . War historians never seem to give generals credit for having thought that X might be better than Y for the next phase of operations . 
 In November , Herring flew across the mountains to take control of the fighting around Buna , leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea . Herring planned the systematic reduction of the Japanese positions at Buna and Sanananda . He struggled to amass enough troops , equipment , guns , and supplies to allow Australian troops under Vasey and Americans under Eichelberger to overcome the Japanese and capture the area . 
 = = = New Guinea campaign = = = 
 Following the victory at Buna , for which Herring and Eichelberger were appointed Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire , Blamey ordered him to return to Australia for a rest . While in Melbourne , Herring had an attack of malaria , but recovered to resume command in New Guinea in May . Blamey charged him with responsibility for the next phase of Operation Cartwheel , the capture of Lae . Herring would command I Corps , which would be part of New Guinea Force , under Blamey and later Mackay . Blamey intended to have Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead command the subsequent phase of the operation , the assault on Madang . 
 At this time operations were in train to drive the Japanese back to Salamaua . Once again , the difficulties of supplying the attacking force were formidable . Out of sensitivity towards the sensibilities of the Americans , Herring left the command arrangements between Major General Stanley Savige 's 3rd Division and units of the American 41st Infantry Division ambiguous . This backfired , producing acrimony between the Australian and American commanders . Herring prepared to fire Savige , but an investigation by Major General Frank Berryman determined that the dispute was not Savige 's fault . 
 The new offensive , which opened on 5 September 1943 with the 7th Division landing at Nadzab by air and 9th Division landing at Lae from the ships of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey 's VII Amphibious Force , saw the rapid capture of Lae . While the 7th Division moved up the Markham and Ramu Valleys , the 9th Division made another landing at Scarlet Beach near Finschhafen . The timing of the landing was contentious , with Barbey , who feared air attack , wanting to land at night while Herring held out for a dawn landing , threatening to take the issue to General MacArthur . Eventually Berryman managed to persuade Herring to accept a compromise H @-@ hour in the darkness before dawn . The U.S. Naval Historian Samuel Eliot Morison noted : " The Australians proved to be right ; ' Uncle Dan 's ' outfit was not prepared for a neat night landing . The usual SNAFU developed . " But Berryman saw Herring as being uncooperative , and his intransigence as a sign of battle weariness . 
 In the subsequent Battle of Finschhafen , it soon became clear that the strength of the Japanese forces there had been seriously underestimated , and the 9th Division needed to be resupplied and reinforced , and its casualties evacuated . Herring strove to get the necessary amphibious lift from the navy but the commander of the United States Seventh Fleet , Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender , was reluctant to expose his ships to the Japanese air threat . The matter went up the chain of command to Mackay , to Blamey , and ultimately to MacArthur , who could do little , given that he had no real authority over the U.S. Navy . 
 Carpender was not inflexible , and reached a compromise with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports ( APDs ) . Herring was in Dobodura , lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell , when he heard this news . He decided to fly to Milne Bay to discuss the matter of resupply in general with Barbey . On 28 September , Herring and two of his staff officers , Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth , boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B @-@ 25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura . As the plane was about to take off , the undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the Marston Mat runway . A propeller shattered , splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland , who was sitting in the navigator 's compartment next to Herring , was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly . The crew , Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed . The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled . Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day , with a fly past by B @-@ 25s . When next he flew , Herring once again took a B @-@ 25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot . 
 Mackay became convinced that Herring was becoming increasingly difficult to work with as a result of stress and fatigue and asked Blamey for permission to relieve him . Blamey 's response was characteristic : Morshead would be on the next plane . Yet Blamey maintained his faith in Herring , who retained command of I Corps on the Atherton Tableland , where he trained his men for the next operation . He did not know when or where this would be , so he focused on amphibious warfare . He created the 1st Beach Group and developed tactics and doctrine for amphibious operations based on his own experience in the New Guinea Campaign and reports from the Allied invasion of Sicily . The benefits of his work would be realised in the Borneo Campaign . 
 = = Chief Justiceship and later life = = 
 On 2 February 1944 , the Victorian government decided to appoint Herring as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria . Blamey advised the Prime Minister that : 
 General Herring is prepared to accept the appointment and I recommend he be released from the Army . He has had two serious attacks of Malaria . I am afraid that in view of his age , further tropical service may seriously injure his health and that the command may suffer as a result . He has rendered excellent service over four years , mainly on active service in the field . 
 It was not quite the end of his military service . Herring was recalled to duty for a year as Director General of Recruiting in August 1950 when the Korean War spurred efforts to build up the Army again . In January 1953 , Herring was selected as leader of the Australian Services Contingent for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . This saw Australian soldiers as the Queen 's Guard at Buckingham Palace on 26 May 1953 , with Herring personally taking part in the procession . On 10 July , he was made a Knight of the Order of St John at Buckingham Palace . At the same time , Mary was made a commander of the same order for her charity work . 
 Herring maintained connections with his comrades from both World Wars . On the way back from the coronation , the Herrings stayed with the <unk> in Asheville , North Carolina . The two generals remained close friends , exchanging regular letters until Eichelberger 's death in 1961 . In 1962 , Herring visited Richard O 'Connor at his home in Ross . In 1967 and 1971 , the Herrings again travelled to America where they were guests of Dwight Johns and his wife . In 1973 , he visited Washington , D.C. for the annual reunion of MacArthur 's staff , and resolved that the next reunion should be held in Australia . He obtained government backing for his idea , and arranged for more than twenty former American generals , including Leif J. Sverdrup , Hugh John Casey , William C. Chase and Clyde D. Eddleman and their wives , to visit Australia in 1974 , with commemorative functions being held in Melbourne , Sydney and Brisbane . Herring steadfastly believed that MacArthur , like Blamey , was a great commander who was not fully appreciated in his own country . 
 Herring 's twenty years as Chief Justice was a period of significant change and growth in the administration of the law . During his period of office the number of judges on the Court increased from six to fourteen , reflecting the growth in cases . Herring earned a reputation as a fine judge and able administrator . He set up the Chief Justice 's Law Reform Committee to try to ensure justice in Victoria 's courts was abreast of the times , and a committee for religious observances and services to arrange the religious services marking the opening of the legal year . Herring retired as Chief Justice in 1964 but stayed on as Lieutenant Governor until his 80th birthday in 1972 , serving in the position for a record 27 years . For his service as Lieutenant Governor , Herring was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King 's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949 . 
 In a speech given on the occasion of his retiring as Chief Justice of Victoria , Herring said : 
 And now the time has come for me to lay down my office , but before I do so there are two matters to which I feel bound to draw attention . The first is this , that under the Australian constitution the great common law courts of Australia are the Supreme Courts of the States . Federal Parliament has no power to set up common law courts and so it is to the Supreme Courts of the States the citizen must look for protection from illegal arrest and other encroachments on his liberty . It is to these Courts that he must come for a writ of habeas corpus . These Courts and their prestige must , therefore , at all costs be sustained so that they will continue to attract the finest characters and best legal brains that we can produce . As a community we will pay heavily if we allow our Supreme Court to be relegated to a position of inferiority . The second matter I feel I should mention is that the principle of the independence of the judiciary from the executive is fundamental to our freedom . What happens when this principle is departed from is evident from what is going on in many lands today . We must see to it that our citizens all understand that an independent judiciary is the greatest bulwark of their liberties and their best protection from totalitarian rule . 
 While opening the Victorian Returned Services League Conference shortly before his retirement as Lieutenant Governor , Herring criticised anti @-@ war protesters and praised Australian soldiers who had served in the Vietnam War . " People who throw stones at Americans , " he said , " should stop and think where we would have been in 1942 without the Americans . " Such remarks earned him a rebuke from the then acting State Opposition Leader , Frank Wilkes , as " untactful " for a representative of the Crown . 
 Herring again became the subject of controversy in May 1978 when Barry Jones revealed in Federal Parliament that during the Second World War Herring had confirmed death sentences on 22 Papuans convicted of handing over seven Anglican missionaries to the Japanese , which Jones called " the darkest secret in modern Australian history " . The Papuans had been convicted of offences including murder and treason . Herring claimed that they had been treated fairly under the conventions and circumstances applicable in wartime . " I have a clear conscience about it " , he said . The seven missionaries had all been murdered by the Japanese . Four of them were women who had been raped as well . The Papuans had also handed over to the Japanese for execution two planters , six Australian soldiers , and two American airmen , and they had murdered Australian soldiers of the 39th Infantry Battalion near Kokoda . They were handed over to ANGAU , which had carried out the executions at <unk> in September 1943 . 
 Herring was president of the Boy Scouts ' Association of Victoria for 23 years , and was later the first president of the Australian Boy Scouts ' Association from 1959 to 1977 . He was chairman of trustees of the Shrine of Remembrance from 1945 to 1978 ( and remained a trustee until his death ) and chairman of trustees of the Australian War Memorial from 1959 to 1974 . He was made a fellow of New College , Oxford , in 1949 , received an honorary DCL from Oxford in 1953 , became an honorary bencher of the Inner Temple in 1963 and received an honorary LLD from Monash University in 1973 . He was also active in the Anglican Church , and for many years was chancellor of the diocese of Melbourne , the highest church office that could be held by a layman . In 1980 he was elected one of the inaugural fellows of Trinity College , Melbourne , under its new constitution . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Herring died at a Camberwell , Victoria , nursing home on 5 January 1982 . He was given a state funeral at St Paul 's Cathedral , Melbourne , planned by his wife , Dame Mary Ranken Herring , who had died three months before . 
 Victoria 's Herring Island is named after him ; it is beside the Monash Freeway ( named for Herrings fellow " civilian soldier " , general and lawyer , Sir John Monash ) in Melbourne 's Yarra River at South Yarra , approximately 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) from the city . Herring 's wartime portraits are in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra , which featured him as one of the fifty most prominent Australians with a military background . His papers are in the State Library of Victoria . 
 = Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine ( 1895 – 1903 ) = 
 Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine ( <unk> Elisabeth Marie Alice Viktoria von Hessen und bei Rhein ) ( 11 March 1895 – 16 November 1903 ) was the only daughter of Ernst Ludwig , Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine and his first wife , Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha . She was named after her paternal great @-@ grandmother , who was born Princess Elisabeth of Prussia . Her paternal aunt had the same name and was also nicknamed Ella . Elisabeth 's early death was rumored to be a result of poison meant for her uncle , Tsar Nicholas II , but the court physician said she died of virulent typhoid , probably caused by her taking a drink of water from a contaminated stream . 
 = = Birth = = 
 Her parents , nicknamed ' Ernie ' and ' Ducky , ' were first cousins who married at the instigation of their common grandmother , Queen Victoria . The marriage was an unhappy one from the start . Princess Victoria Melita was eighteen at the time of Elisabeth 's birth . She was fond of Elisabeth , but found it hard to compete with Ernst 's devotion to their daughter . Ernst was convinced even before Elisabeth could speak that he alone could understand her . At the age of six months , she was scheduled to move to a new nursery and her father ' consulted ' her on her color preferences . He claimed that she made ' happy little squeals ' when he showed her a particular shade of lilac material . Ernst then decorated her nursery in shades of lilac . He later had a playhouse built for his daughter that stood in its own garden . Adults were forbidden to enter " much to the frustration of royal nurses and tutors , who could be seen pacing up and down impatiently outside as they waited for their high @-@ spirited young charges to stop their games and emerge . " 
 = = Childhood = = 
 Margaretta Eagar , a governess for the daughters of Tsar Nicholas II , described Elisabeth as " a sweet and pretty child , with wide grey @-@ blue eyes and a profusion of dark hair . She was much like her mother , not only in face , but also in manner . " The four @-@ year @-@ old Elisabeth wanted a baby sister and tried to persuade her aunt and uncle to let her parents adopt one of her paternal first cousins , Tatiana or Maria . Her parents had only one other child together , a stillborn son , in 1900 . 
 She was a favorite with her great @-@ grandmother , Queen Victoria , who called the little girl " my precious . " Queen Victoria refused to permit the unhappily married Victoria and Ernst to divorce for the sake of Elisabeth . It was Elisabeth whom Queen Victoria asked to see first and to receive eightieth birthday greetings from in 1899 . When the child heard Queen Victoria 's pony cart approaching on the road below Windsor Castle , the four @-@ year @-@ old Elisabeth ran out on the balcony , waving and calling , " Granny Gran , I 'm here ! " Elisabeth 's playfulness made the queen laugh out loud . 
 Elisabeth 's grandmother , Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia , the Duchess of Edinburgh , brought five @-@ year @-@ old Elisabeth to see Queen Victoria on her death bed on 22 January 1901 . After the queen died , the child was taken in to see her body and told that her great @-@ grandmother had gone to be with the angels . " But I don 't see the wings , " Elisabeth whispered . Elisabeth sat next to her second cousin , Prince Edward of York ( called David by family and friends , later to become King Edward VIII ) during Queen Victoria 's funeral . " Sweet little David behaved so well during the service , " wrote his aunt Maud , " and was supported by the little Hesse girl who took him under her protection and held him most of the time round his neck . They looked such a delightful little couple . " 
 In his memoirs , written more than thirty years after her death , her father wrote of Elisabeth 's " deep sensitivity " and " very large heart . " He wrote that " I never knew a child who had so much influence on adults . Her inner personality was very strong , and she had a natural quality that protected her from being spoiled . " In October 1901 , after the death of Queen Victoria , Elisabeth 's parents finally divorced . Her mother had rekindled a previous romance with another cousin , her future husband , Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia . Her father , according to letters written by her mother , had been caught cavorting with domestic servants . Her parents ' divorce meant that Elisabeth divided her year between Darmstadt and her mother 's new home in Coburg . Elisabeth was at first mistrustful of her mother and resented the divorce , although Victoria did her best to mend her relationship with her daughter during her visit with Elisabeth in the spring of 1902 . She was only partially successful , though Victoria enjoyed turning her daughter into an outstanding horsewoman . 
 In his memoirs , Ernst said he had difficulty persuading Elisabeth to visit her mother . Before one visit , he found the child " whimpering under a sofa , full of despair . " He assured Elisabeth that her mother loved her too . " Mama says she loves me , but you do love me , " Elisabeth replied . Margaret Eagar thought the child 's eyes were the saddest she had ever seen . " Looking at her I used to wonder what those wide grey @-@ blue eyes saw , to bring such a look of sadness to the childish face , " she wrote . Eagar wondered if Elisabeth had a premonition of her own death because she often told her cousin Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia that " I shall never see this again . " However , despite Elisabeth 's sad eyes , she was generally a sweet , happy child who was a peacemaker when her cousins had a dispute . 
 = = Death = = 
 On 6 October 1903 , Ernst hosted a large family gathering at Darmstadt for the wedding of his niece , Princess Alice of Battenberg , to Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark . A few weeks later he took Elisabeth to stay with his younger sister , Empress Alexandra Feodorovna , her husband , Tsar Nicholas II , and their family . At the imperial family 's hunting lodge in <unk> , Poland , Elisabeth went on long walks and had picnics in the forest with her cousins . 
 Her nanny , who called Elisabeth " my baby , " woke Elisabeth in the middle of the night and settled her in a window seat of the nursery so that she might look out on the game spread out upon the grounds below . One morning , the eight @-@ year @-@ old awoke with a sore throat and pains in her chest , which the Russian Court doctor put down to too much excitement with her cousins the previous day . Her fever rose to 104 degrees . The imperial party didn 't believe her illness was a serious one and went ahead with their plans for the day and attended the theater as planned . By the evening Elisabeth was in even more severe pain and had started gasping for breath . A specialist was summoned from Warsaw . The specialist gave her injections of caffeine and camphor to stimulate her slowing heart , but without success . 
 " Suddenly she sat up in her bed and looked from one to the other of us with wide , frightened eyes , " wrote Eagar . " She cried out suddenly , ' I 'm dying ! I 'm dying ! ' She was coaxed to lie down again , but remained agitated . " The child turned to me , and said anxiously , ' Send a telegram to mama . ' " Eagar promised it would be done . " She added , ' immediately . ' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life , but moment by moment it declined . She began to talk to her cousins , and seemed to imagine she was playing with them . She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room . The dying eyes rested on her for a moment , and Anastasie said , ' Poor cousin Ella ! Poor Princess Elizabeth ! ' I took the baby out of the room . " Doctors told Alexandra that the child 's mother should be notified , but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning , when Elisabeth had already died . An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid , although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar . 
 = = Funeral and legacy = = 
 Elisabeth 's body was placed in a silver casket , a gift from Nicholas II , for the journey back to Darmstadt . Her father arranged a white funeral , with white instead of black for the funeral trappings , white flowers , and white horses for the procession . The Hessian people came out by the thousands to view the funeral procession and " sobbed in unison so that I could hear it , " Ernst wrote . A cousin , Kaiser Wilhelm II , expressed shock at the child 's death in a letter to Tsar Nicholas II on 7 November 1903 . " How joyous and merry she was that day at <unk> , when I was there , so full of life and fun and health ... What a terrible heartrending blow for poor Ernie , who doted and adored that little enchantress ! " Elisabeth was buried in the <unk> with other members of the Hessian grand ducal family . A marble angel was later installed to watch over her grave . In a final gesture to Elisabeth and Ernst , Victoria Melita placed her badge of the Order of Hesse , granted to her upon her marriage , into Elisabeth 's coffin . Ernst was still devastated by the memory of his daughter 's death thirty years later . " My little Elisabeth , " he wrote in his memoirs , " was the sunshine of my life . "

 = Thiomersal controversy = 
 The thiomersal controversy describes claims that vaccines containing the mercury @-@ based preservative thiomersal contribute to the development of autism and other brain development disorders . <unk> is no longer used in children 's vaccines in the United States , except some types of flu shots . While exposure to mercury may result in damage to brain , kidneys , and developing fetus , the current scientific consensus has found no convincing scientific evidence supporting claims that thiomersal has such effects . 
 Thiomersal is an <unk> compound used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination . Following a mandated review of mercury @-@ containing food and drugs in 1999 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) asked vaccine makers to remove thiomersal from vaccines as quickly as possible as a precautionary measure , and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European vaccines . It is still used in all multi @-@ dose vials of flu vaccines in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule , some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism . 
 The potential impact of thiomersal on autism has been investigated extensively . Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause autism . For example , the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning differ significantly from those of autism . In addition , multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and autism , and rates of autism have continued to increase despite removal of thiomersal from vaccines . Thus , major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization ( WHO ) as well as governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders . In spite of the consensus of the scientific community , some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to autism . 
 This controversy has caused harm due to parents attempting to treat their autistic children with unproven and possibly dangerous treatments , discouraging parents from <unk> their children due to fears about thiomersal toxicity and diverting resources away from research into more promising areas for the cause of autism . Thousands of lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. to seek damages from alleged toxicity from vaccines , including those purportedly caused by thiomersal . US courts have ruled against multiple representative test cases involving thiomersal , suggesting the majority are unlikely to succeed . A 2011 journal article described the vaccine @-@ autism connection as " the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years " . 
 Outside of the United States , worries about thiomersal had not gained any significant traction as of 2009 . 
 = = History = = 
 Thiomersal was introduced as a preservative in the 1930s to prevent the growth of infectious organisms such as bacteria and fungi , and has been in use in vaccines and other products such as immunoglobulin preparations and ophthalmic and nasal solutions . Vaccine manufacturers have used preservatives to prevent microbial growth during the manufacturing process or when packaged as " multi @-@ dose " products to allow for multiple punctures of the same vial to dispense multiple vaccinations with less fear of contamination . After the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 mandated a review and risk assessment of all mercury @-@ containing food and drugs , vaccine manufacturers responded to FDA requests made in December 1998 and April 1999 to provide detailed information about the thiomersal content of their preparations . 
 A review of the data showed that while the vaccine schedule for infants did not exceed FDA , Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ( ATSDR ) , or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure , it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) standards for the first six months of life , depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant . The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury , a different mercury compound with different <unk> properties . Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence . There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal , with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey , director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks . In the process of forming the response to this information , the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped . 
 Upon conclusion of their review , the FDA , in conjunction with the other members of the US Public Health Service ( USPHS ) , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , CDC and Health Resources and Services Administration ( HRSA ) , in a joint statement with the AAP in July 1999 concluded that there was " no evidence of harm caused by doses of thimerosal found in vaccines , except for local hypersensitivity reactions . " 
 Despite the lack of convincing evidence of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative , the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure . This action was based on the precautionary principle , which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary . The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite the lack of evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines , the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines . Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S. , some vaccines continue to contain non @-@ trace amounts of thiomersal , mainly in multi @-@ dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus . 
 In 2004 <unk> posted an article saying that chelation therapy has been falsely promoted as effective against autism , and that practitioners falsified diagnoses of metal poisoning to " trick " parents into having their children undergo the process . As of 2008 , between 2 – 8 % of children with autism had had the therapy . 
 = = = Rationale for concern = = = 
 Although intended to increase public confidence in vaccinations , the decision to remove thiomersal instead led to some parents suspecting thiomersal as a cause of autism . This concern over a vaccine @-@ autism link grew from a confluence of several underlying factors . First , methylmercury had for decades been the subject of widespread environmental and media concern after two highly publicized episodes of poisonings in the 1950s and 1960s in Minamata Bay , Japan from industrial waste and in the 1970s in Iraq from fungicide contamination of wheat . These incidents led to new research on methylmercury safety and culminated in the publication of an array of confusing recommendations by public health agencies in the 1990s warning against methylmercury exposure in adults and pregnant women , which ensured a continued high public awareness of mercury toxicity . Second , the vaccine schedule for infants expanded in the 1990s to include more vaccines , some of which , including the Hib vaccine , <unk> vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine , could have contained thiomersal . Third , the number of diagnoses of autism grew in the 1990s , leading parents of these children to search for an explanation for the apparent rise in diagnoses , including considering possible environmental factors . The dramatic increase in reported cases of autism during the 1990s and early 2000s is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices , referral patterns , availability of services , age at diagnosis , and public awareness , and it is unknown whether autism 's true prevalence increased during the period . Nevertheless , some parents believed that there was a growing " autism epidemic " and connected these three factors to conclude that the increase in number of vaccines , and specifically the mercury in thiomersal in those vaccines , were causing a dramatic increase in the incidence of autism . 
 Advocates of a thiomersal @-@ autism link also relied on indirect evidence from the scientific literature , including analogy with neurotoxic effects of other mercury compounds , the reported epidemiologic association between autism and vaccine use , and extrapolation from in vitro experiments and animal studies Studies conducted by Mark Geier and his son David Geier have been the most frequently cited research by parents advocating a link between thiomersal and autism . This research by Geier has received considerable criticism for methodological problems in his research , including not presenting methods and statistical analyses to others for verification , improperly analyzing data taken from Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System , as well as either <unk> or confusing fundamental statistical terms in his papers , leading to results that were " <unk> " . 
 = = = Publicity of concern = = = 
 Several months after the recommendation to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published , a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses , a non @-@ peer @-@ reviewed journal , by parents who launched the parental advocacy group <unk> to promote the theory that thiomersal caused autism . The controversy began to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the public from this foundation , and gained widening support within certain elements in the autism advocacy community as well as in the political arena , with U.S. Representative Dan Burton openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional hearings on the subject . 
 Further support for the association between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the pharmaceutical industry , and a book written by David Kirby , Evidence of Harm , dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children , with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy . Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations , the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy 's celebrity . Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy 's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16 , 2011 , stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined the value of the article to the editors . 
 Meanwhile , during this time of increased media publicity of the controversy , public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered . Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full @-@ page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus that there is no convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism . Paul Offit , a leading vaccine researcher and advocate , has also noted a tendency in the media to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation . 
 Despite the consensus from experts that there is no link between thiomersal and autism , many parents continue to hold on to their belief that such a link exists . These parents share the viewpoint that autism is not just treatable , but curable through " biomedical " interventions and have been frustrated by the lack of progress from more " mainline " scientists in finding this cure . Instead , they have supported an alternative community of like @-@ minded parents , physicians and scientists who promote this belief . This mindset has taught these parents to challenge the expertise from the mainstream scientific community . Parents have also been influenced by a large number of online anti @-@ vaccination websites that present themselves as an alternative source for evidence using pseudoscientific claims . These websites use emotional appeals to gather support and frame the controversy as an adversarial dispute between parents and a conspiracy of doctors and scientists . Advocates for a thiomersal @-@ autism link have also relied on celebrities like model Jenny McCarthy and information presented on Don Imus ' Imus in the Morning radio show to persuade the public to their cause , instead of relying only on " dry " scientific papers and scientists . McCarthy has published a book describing her personal experience with her autistic son and appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to promote the hypothesis of vaccines causing autism . Bitterness over this issue has led to numerous threats made against the CDC as well as researchers like Offit , with increased security placed by the CDC in response to these threats . 
 = = Scientific evaluation = = 
 = = = Rationale for doubting link = = = 
 Various lines of evidence undermine a proposed link between thiomersal and autism . For example , although advocates of a thiomersal @-@ autism link consider autism a form of " mercury poisoning , " the typical symptoms of mercury toxicity are significantly different from symptoms seen in autism . Likewise , the <unk> and histopathologic features of the brains of patients who have mercury poisoning , both with methylmercury as well as ethylmercury , have significant differences from the brains of people with autism . Previous episodes of widespread mercury toxicity in a population such as in Minamata Bay , Japan would also be expected to lead to documentation of a significant rise in autism or autism @-@ like behavior in children should autism be caused by mercury poisoning . However , research on several episodes of acute and chronic mercury poisoning have not documented any such rise in autism like behavior . Although some parents cite an association between the timing of onset of autistic symptoms with the timing of vaccinations as evidence of an environmental cause such as thiomersal , this line of reasoning can be misleading . Associations such as these do not establish causation as the two occurring together may be only coincidental in nature . Also , genetic disorders that have no environmental triggers such as Rett syndrome and Huntington 's disease nevertheless have specific ages when they begin to show symptoms , suggesting specific ages of onset of symptoms does not necessarily require an environmental cause . 
 Although the concern for a thiomersal @-@ autism link was originally derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury , recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated . <unk> , such as in thiomersal , clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury , suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury . Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury , and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury , suggesting a lower risk of brain damage . These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury , which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury , were flawed . 
 = = = Population studies = = = 
 Multiple studies have been performed on data from large populations of children to study the relationship between the use of vaccines containing thiomersal , and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders . Almost all of these studies have found no association between thiomersal @-@ containing vaccines ( TCVs ) and autism , and studies done after the removal of thiomersal from vaccines have nevertheless shown autism rates continuing to increase . The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier , whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews . 
 In Europe , a cohort study of 467 @,@ 450 Danish children found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) , nor any dose @-@ response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs that would be suggestive of toxic exposure . An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal . A retrospective cohort study on 109 @,@ 863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism , but a possible increased risk for tics . Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders , attention @-@ deficit disorder , and otherwise unspecified developmental delay . Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13 @,@ 617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders . Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria @-@ tetanus @-@ pertussis ( DTP ) or diphtheria @-@ tetanus ( DT ) vaccines , they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels that occurred in the U.S. 
 In North America , a Canadian study of 27 @,@ 749 children in Quebec showed that thiomersal was unrelated to the increasing trend in pervasive developmental disorders ( <unk> ) . In fact , the study noted that rates of <unk> were higher in the birth cohorts with no thiomersal when compared to those with medium or high levels of exposure . A study performed in the US which analyzed data from 78 @,@ 829 children enrolled in HMOs taken from the Vaccine Safety <unk> ( <unk> ) did not show any consistent association between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes , noting different results from data in different HMOs . A study performed in California found that removal of thiomersal from vaccines did not decrease the rates of autism , suggesting that thiomersal could not be the primary cause of autism . A study on children from Denmark , Sweden and California likewise argued against TCVs being causally associated with autism . 
 = = = Scientific consensus = = = 
 Due to growing concerns in the public , in 2001 the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health asked the U.S. National Academy of Science 's ( NAS ) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns . This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time , there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal @-@ autism link , though it was biologically plausible . 
 Since this report was released , several independent reviews have examined the body of published research for a possible thiomersal @-@ autism link by examining the theoretical mechanisms of thiomersal causing harm and by reviewing the in vitro , animal , and population studies that have been published . These reviews determined that no significant evidence exists to establish thiomersal as the cause of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders . 
 The scientific consensus on the subject is reflected in a follow up report that was subsequently published in 2004 by the Institute of Medicine , which took into account new data that had been published since the 2001 report . The committee noted , in response to those who cite in vitro or animal models as evidence for the link between autism and thiomersal : 
 " However , the experiments showing effects of thimerosal on biochemical pathways in cell culture systems and showing abnormalities in the immune system or metal metabolism in people with autism are provocative ; the autism research community should consider the appropriate composition of the autism research portfolio with some of these new findings in mind . However , these experiments do not provide evidence of a relationship between vaccines or thimerosal and autism . In the absence of experimental or human evidence that vaccination ( either the MMR vaccine or the preservative thimerosal ) affects metabolic , developmental , immune , or other physiological or molecular mechanisms that are causally related to the development of autism , the committee concludes that the hypotheses generated to date are theoretical only . " 
 The committee concludes : 
 " Thus , based on this body of evidence , the committee concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal @-@ containing vaccines and autism . " [ bold in original ] 
 Further evidence of the scientific consensus includes the rejection of a causal link between thiomersal and autism by multiple national and international scientific and medical bodies including the American Medical Association , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American College of Medical Toxicology , the Canadian Paediatric Society , the U.S. National Academy of Sciences , the Food and Drug Administration , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the World Health Organization , the Public Health Agency of Canada , and the European Medicines Agency . 
 A 2011 journal article reflects this point of view and described the vaccine @-@ autism connection as " the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years " . 
 = = Consequences = = 
 The suggestion that thiomersal has contributed to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders has had a number of effects . Public health officials believe fear driven by advocates of a thiomersal @-@ autism link has caused parents to avoid vaccination or adopt " made up " vaccination schedules that expose their children to increased risk from preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis . Advocates of a thiomersal @-@ autism link have also helped enact laws in six states ( California , Delaware , Illinois , Missouri , New York and Washington ) between 2004 and 2006 to limit the use of thiomersal given to pregnant women and children , although later attempts in 2009 in twelve other states failed to pass . These laws can be temporarily suspended , but vaccine advocates doubt their utility given the lack of evidence for danger with thiomersal in vaccines . Vaccine advocates are also concerned that passage of such laws help fuel a backlash against vaccination and contribute to doubts about the safety of vaccines that are unwarranted . 
 During the period of time of removal of thiomersal , the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis . This decision , though following the precautionary principle , nevertheless sparked confusion , controversy and some harm . Approximately 10 % of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns , and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it . Similarly , a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times . This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer . 
 The notion that thiomersal causes autism has led some parents to have their children treated with costly and potentially dangerous therapies such as chelation therapy , which is typically used to treat heavy metal poisoning , due to parental fears that autism is a form of " mercury poisoning " . As many as 2 to 8 % of autistic children in the U.S. , numbering as many as several thousand children per year , receive mercury @-@ chelating agents . Although critics of using chelation therapy as an autism treatment point to a lack of any evidence to support its use , hundreds of doctors prescribe these medications despite possible side effects including nutritional deficiencies as well as damage to the liver and kidney . The popularity of this therapy caused a " public health imperative " that led the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) to commission a study about chelation in autism by studying DMSA , a chelating agent used for lead poisoning , despite worries from critics that there would be no chance it would show positive results and it would be unlikely to convince parents to not use the therapy . Ultimately , the study was halted due to ethical concerns that there would be too much risk to children with autism who did not have toxic levels of mercury or lead due to a new animal study showing possible cognitive and emotional problems associated with DMSA . A 5 @-@ year @-@ old autistic boy died from cardiac arrest immediately after receiving chelation therapy treatment using EDTA in 2005 . 
 The notion has also diverted attention and resources away from efforts to determine the causes of autism . The 2004 Institute of Medicine report committee recommended that while it supported " targeted research that focuses on better understanding the disease of autism , from a public health perspective the committee does not consider a significant investment in studies of the theoretical vaccine @-@ autism connection to be useful at this time . " Alison Singer , a senior executive of Autism Speaks , resigned from the group in 2009 in a dispute over whether to fund more research on links between vaccination and autism , saying , " There isn 't an unlimited pot of money , and every dollar spent looking where we know the answer isn 't is one less dollar we have to spend where we might find new answers . " 
 = = Court cases = = 
 From 1988 until August 2010 , 5 @,@ 632 claims relating to autism were made to Office of Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ( commonly known as the " Vaccine Court " ) which oversees vaccine injury claims , of which one case has received compensation , 738 cases have been dismissed with no compensations made , and with the remaining cases pending . In the one case which received compensation , the U.S. government agreed to pay for injury to a child that had a pre @-@ existing mitochondrial disorder who developed autism @-@ like symptoms after multiple vaccinations , some of which included thiomersal . Citing the inability to rule out a role of these vaccinations in exacerbating her underlying mitochondrial disorder as the rationale for payment , CDC officials cautioned against generalizing this one case to all autism @-@ related vaccine cases as most patients with autism do not have a mitochondrial disorder . In February 2009 , this court also ruled on three autism @-@ related cases , each exploring different mechanisms that plaintiffs proposed linked thiomersal @-@ containing vaccines with autism . Three judges independently found no evidence that vaccines caused autism and denied the plaintiffs compensation . Since these same mechanisms formed the basis for the vast majority of remaining autism @-@ related vaccine injury cases , the chance for compensation in any of these cases has significantly decreased . In March 2010 , the court ruled in three other test cases that thiomersal @-@ containing vaccines do not cause autism . 
 = Tute = 
 Tute ( Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is a trick @-@ taking card game for two to four players . Originating in Italy , where it was known as Tutti , during the 19th century the game spread in Spain , becoming one of the most popular card games in the country . The name of the game was later modified by Spanish speakers , who started calling the game Tute . The game is played with a deck of traditional Spanish playing cards , or <unk> , that is very similar to the Italian 40 @-@ card deck . 
 The classic version of the game is Two @-@ player Tute , while the most played is Tute in Pairs , where four players form two teams . The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza ( a pile next to a player that contains the cards that the player gets after winning a trick ) and by declarations ( holding certain combinations of cards ) . Due to its wide popularity , several variations of the game exist . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Tute originated in Italy . The game belongs to the same family as <unk> and has similar rules in gameplay and final count of points . The name of the game originated from the Italian word Tutti ( all ) , the declaration that a player announces when holding the four kings . The game spread to Spain during the 19th century , brought back by Spanish troops who returned from missions in Italy . As the popularity of the game increased , its name was modified over time by Spanish speakers , who started calling the game Tute . The game became one of the most popular in Spain , leading to the later appearance of regional variations of the game . 
 The game is played with a Spanish deck of cards , which is divided into four suits : Oros ( coins ) , <unk> ( spades ) , Copas ( cups ) and Bastos ( clubs ) . The 8s and 9s of each suit are excluded , leaving forty cards in the deck . The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza and from declarations ( see Scoring below ) . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 = = = Two @-@ player Tute = = = 
 During the deal , each player receives eight cards . After the last card is dealt , one more card is drawn . It indicates which suit becomes the trump . The card is placed perpendicular to the stock , at the bottom . 
 The first player chooses a card to play . If the second player has one or more cards of higher value of the same suit as this card , one of them must be played , and the second player wins the trick . If the second player has cards of the same suit , but only ones of less value than the first card , one of these must be played ; in this case , the second player loses the trick . If the second player does not have any cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards , one of these must be played ; the second player wins the trick . If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps , any other card can be played , and the second player loses the trick . 
 The winning player takes both cards of the trick , and places them face down in an individual pile on the table , called the baza . These cards are out of play until scores are calculated , at the end of the round . 
 The winner of the trick takes the first card from the stock , and the loser the second ; thus , until the stock runs out , they each hold ten cards at the start of every trick . When the trump card at the bottom of the deck is superior to a 7 ( Ace , Three , King , Knight , or Knave ) , the player that holds the 7 of the trump suit is able to exchange it for any of these . The 7 , and cards of lesser value ( 6 , 5 , and 4 ) , can later be exchanged only by a 2 . The trump exchanges are allowed anytime in the game until only the last two cards are left in the stock . 
 After a player makes the first baza , that player is allowed to announce declarations . Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock ( the last faced @-@ down card , and the faced @-@ up trump below it ) . After these final two cards are picked up , all of the cards the players hold must be played in order to finish the round . When the round is over , the players start to count their scores ( see Scoring below ) . After the counting ends , and their scores are calculated , the cards in the <unk> are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt at the start of the next round . 
 = = = Tute in pairs = = = 
 Tute in Pairs is played by four players — two teams of two players each — and every player receives ten cards ( since there are 40 cards , this means that all of the cards in the deck are dealt ) . The last card to be dealt is shown to the rest of the players and becomes the trump . This card belongs to the player it was dealt to . The four people sit in a circle , with opponent players to the right and left of each player , and players sitting opposite their team members . 
 One person plays a card , and the player to the right of this person , from the opponent team , plays a card . As with Two @-@ player Tute , if the second player has one or more higher cards of the same suit as the first player 's card , one of these must be played . If the second player has cards of the same suit , but only ones of less value than the first card , one of these must be played . If the second player does not have any cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards , one of these must be played . If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps , any other card can be played . 
 Now , the next player to the right plays a card following the same rules as the second player : if possible , a card of the same suit as the first player 's card must be played , higher than the first two cards if possible ; or if this is not possible , then lower ; if no card of the same suit is held , then if possible , a trump card must be played ; if no trump card is held , then any card may be played . The fourth player likewise plays a card following these same rules . 
 When all four cards of the trick are on the table , the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand . The trump suit beats the other three suits , with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows : Ace @-@ 3 @-@ King @-@ Knight @-@ Knave @-@ 7 @-@ 6 @-@ 5 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 . The next strongest suit is the one the first player played , again with the card rankings being Ace @-@ 3 @-@ King @-@ Knight @-@ Knave @-@ 7 @-@ 6 @-@ 5 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 . Cards of the other two suits always lose to trumps and the first player 's suit . The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza . The rules for the declarations are similar to Two @-@ player Tute , but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza . Only the scoring team can declare . To declare their cards , the opposing team has to begin a baza . Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed . After the hand is over , the counting starts ( see Scoring below ) . When the counting ends , and after the score is calculated , the cards in the <unk> are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt at the start of the next round . The deal of cards rotates counter @-@ clockwise during the subsequent hands . 
 = = Scoring = = 
 Tute games are played until an established number of game points is reached . Each time one of the competitors wins a round , one point is added to the total score of the player or pair . New rounds are played until a player or pair reaches the game points goal ( three and six point games are the most common ) . When the number is reached the player or pair wins . 
 The winner ( or the pair of winners ) of the round is determined by the total of round points each player ( or pair ) collects . These points are calculated as the sum of card values in baza , bonus points for declarations and the final trick bonus . 
 = = = Card values = = = 
 The values of cards are associated with their ranks : 
 The rest of the cards ( 7 @-@ 6 @-@ 5 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 ) are called <unk> <unk> ( white cards ) because their value is zero round points . 
 = = = Declarations = = = 
 A player ( or a pair ) , who wins at least one trick receives an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations . In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed until the end of round ; in Two @-@ player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in the deck . 
 The player , who collected all the four Kings , is entitled to declare <unk> ( all ) , which automatically ends the round with a collector 's victory . Having both King and Knight of the trump suit , one can declare las cuarenta ( forty ) , scoring additional 40 round points . The combination of King and Knight of any other suit can be declared as veinte ( twenty ) ; it adds 20 round points to the player 's score . If possible , a player can declare several combination . In such cases the declarations with the higher round point value must be made first . For example , after declaring veinte the player loses right to declare las cuarenta , though declaring another veinte is still allowed . In Two @-@ player games the declaration order rule only applies to declarations between each trick is played , so the player can declare las cuarenta after veinte if the combination is collected by picking the previously missing card from the stock . 
 The total of the round points the player ( or pair ) has gained is calculated as the sum of values of the cards collected in the baza and the values of the declared combinations . The winner of the last trick also receives ten bonus round points . The total value of the deck ( and thus the maximum amount of round points ) is 230 points . 
 = = Variants = = 
 Due to the popularity of the game in Spain , modifications to the traditional rules have appeared regionally , creating variations . The variants are played with similar rules to normal Tute , but differing in the number of cards , rules for declarations , and other minor modifications of the traditional rules . 
 = Mass Rapid Transit ( Singapore ) = 
 The Mass Rapid Transit , or MRT , is a rapid transit system forming the major component of the railway system in Singapore , spanning the entire city @-@ state . The initial section of the MRT , between Yio Chu Kang and Toa Payoh , opened on 7 November 1987 , making it the second @-@ oldest metro system in Southeast Asia , after Manila 's LRT System . The network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore 's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the public transport system in Singapore , with an average daily ridership of 3 @.@ 031 million in 2015 ( including the Light Rail Transit ( LRT ) ) , approximately 78 % of the bus network 's 3 @.@ 891 million in the same period . 
 The MRT network encompasses 170 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 106 @.@ 1 mi ) of route , with 102 stations in operation , on standard gauge . The lines are built by the Land Transport Authority , a statutory board of the Government of Singapore , which allocates operating concessions to the profit @-@ based corporations , SMRT Corporation and SBS Transit . These operators also run bus and taxi services , thus facilitating full integration of public transport services . The MRT is complemented by a small number of local LRT networks in Bukit Panjang , Sengkang and Punggol that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of the Mass Rapid Transit ( MRT ) are derived from a forecast by city planners in 1967 which stated the need for a rail @-@ based urban transport system by 1992 . Following a debate on whether a bus @-@ only system would be more cost @-@ effective , Ong Teng Cheong , came to the conclusion that an all @-@ bus system would be inadequate , as it would have to compete for road space in a land @-@ scarce country . The initial S $ 5 billion construction of the Mass Rapid Transit network was Singapore 's largest public works project at the time , starting on 22 October 1983 at Shan Road . The network was built in stages , with the North South Line given priority because it passed through the Central Area that has a high demand for public transport . The Mass Rapid Transit Corporation ( MRTC ) , later renamed as SMRT Corporation — was established on 14 October 1983 ; it took over the roles and responsibilities of the former provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority . On 7 November 1987 , the first section of the North South Line started operations , consisting of five stations over six kilometres . Fifteen more stations were opened later , and the MRT system was officially launched on 12 March 1988 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew . Another 21 stations were subsequently added to the system ; the opening of Boon Lay on the East West Line on 6 July 1990 marked the completion of the system two years ahead of schedule . 
 The MRT has subsequently been expanded . The first expansion was in 1996 . This was a S $ 1 @.@ 2 billion expansion of the North South Line into Woodlands , merging the Branch Line into the North South Line and joining Yishun and Choa Chu Kang Stations . The concept of having rail lines that bring people almost directly to their homes led to the introduction of the Light Rail Transit ( LRT ) lines connecting with the MRT network . On 6 November 1999 , the first LRT trains on the Bukit Panjang LRT went into operation . In 2002 , the Changi Airport and Expo stations were added to the MRT network . The North East Line , the first line operated by SBS Transit , opened on 20 June 2003 , one of the first fully automated heavy rail lines in the world . On 15 January 2006 , after intense lobbying by the public , <unk> station was opened . The Boon Lay Extension of the East West Line , consisting of Pioneer and Joo Koon stations , began revenue service on 28 February 2009 . The Circle Line opened in four stages from 28 May 2009 to 14 January 2012 . Stage 1 of Downtown Line opened on 22 December 2013 with its official opening made on 21 December 2013 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong . Stage 2 opened on 27 December 2015 , with its official opening on 26 December by Prime Minister Lee .

 The following table lists the Mass Rapid Transit lines that are currently operational : 
 = = = Facilities and services = = = 
 Except for the partly at @-@ grade Bishan , the entirety of the MRT is elevated or underground . Most below @-@ ground stations are deep and hardened enough to withstand conventional aerial bomb attacks and to serve as bomb shelters . Mobile phone and 3G service is available in every part of the network . Underground stations and the trains themselves are air @-@ conditioned , while above @-@ ground stations have ceiling fans installed . 
 Every station is equipped with General Ticketing Machines ( <unk> ) , a Passenger Service Centre and LED or plasma displays that show train service information and announcements . All stations are equipped with restrooms and payphones ; some restrooms are located at street level . Some stations , especially the major ones , have additional amenities and services , such as retail shops and kiosks , supermarkets , convenience stores , automatic teller machines , and self @-@ service automated kiosks for a variety of services . Heavy @-@ duty escalators at stations carry passengers up or down at a rate of 0 @.@ 75 m / s , 50 % faster than conventional escalators . 
 The older stations on the North South and East West lines were originally built with no accessibility facilities , such as lifts , ramps , tactile guidance systems ( Braille <unk> on the floor surface ) , wider fare gates , or toilets for passengers with disabilities ; authorities in the past actively discouraged use of their system by the disabled . Now , these facilities are being progressively installed as part of a programme to make all stations accessible to the elderly and to those with disabilities . All stations are now barrier @-@ free , although works are still ongoing to provide stations with additional barrier @-@ free facilities . The installation of lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges next to six MRT stations and additional bicycle racks at 20 stations is slated to be completed by the end of 2013 . 
 = = = Hours of operation = = = 
 MRT lines operate from 5 : 30am to before 1 : 00am daily , with the exception of selected periods such as New Year 's Eve , Chinese New Year , Deepavali , Hari Raya , Christmas , eves of public holidays , and special occasions such as the state funeral of Lee Kuan Yew ( 2015 ) , when most of the lines stay open throughout the night or extended till later . MRT serves as an essential purpose of transport owing to the support from various organisations and being a car @-@ lite society . When train services operate 24 hours , operators cannot carry out maintenance and engineering works to be done overnight . 
 = = = Rolling Stock = = = 
 The following table lists the rolling stock of the network : 
 At present , all Singapore lines run with fixed length trains between three and six cars , with the future Thomson @-@ East Coast Line using four cars . Since the system 's conception in 1987 , all train lines have been powered by the 750 volt DC third rail , with the exception of the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC overhead lines . The North South and East West lines uses an automatic train operation system that is similar to London Underground 's Victoria line . 
 No rolling stock has been completely scrapped since service began , with the oldest C151 trains operating since the inauguration of the MRT System in 1987 . Older trains have been renewed over the years under refurbishment schemes to enhance their lifespan as well as to adhere to updated safety and usability codes . <unk> and new trains sport sleeker designs , improved passenger information systems , more grab poles , wider seats , more space near the doors , spaces for wheelchairs and CCTV cameras . As a trial run , luggage racks were installed on the C751B trains to serve travellers on the Changi Airport branch line . However , the scheme was subsequently withdrawn in June 2002 and the luggage racks removed . 
 All trains are contracted by open tender , with their contract numbers forming the most recognised name of the stock . Official sources occasionally refer to the trains of the North South and East West lines as numbered generation trains , with the C151 train being the first and the newest <unk> train being the Sixth . 
 = = = Signalling = = = 
 All Mass Rapid Transit Lines are able to run automatically , and with exception of the North South Line and the East West Line , are fully driverless and automated . The following list documents the systems : 
 = = = Depots = = = 
 SMRT Corporation has four train depots : Bishan Depot is the central maintenance depot with train overhaul facilities , while Changi Depot and Ulu Pandan Depot inspect and house trains overnight . In March 2012 , it was announced the new Tuas Depot would be ready in 2016 for the East West Line . The underground Kim Chuan Depot houses trains for the Circle Line and Downtown Line , now jointly managed by the two operators . 
 SBS Transit has two depots : Sengkang Depot houses trains for the North East Line , the Sengkang LRT and the Punggol LRT . Kim Chuan Depot is currently jointly operated with SMRT for the Downtown Line . Major operations will eventually be shifted to the main Gali Batu Depot by end 2015 although it will continue to operate on a minor capacity . 
 In August 2014 , plans for the world 's first four @-@ in @-@ one train and bus depot were announced . It will be built at Tanah Merah beside the original Changi Depot site to serve the East West , Downtown , and Thomson @-@ East Coast lines . The new <unk> depot can house about 220 trains and 550 buses and integrating the depot for both buses and trains will help save close to 66 @.@ 12 acres ( 26 @.@ 76 ha ) , or 60 football fields ' worth , of land space . 
 = = = Architecture and art = = = 
 Early stages of the MRT 's construction paid relatively scant attention to station design , with an emphasis on functionality over aesthetics . This is particularly evident in the first few stages of the North South and East West lines that opened between 1987 and 1988 from Yio Chu Kang to Clementi . An exception to this was Orchard , chosen by its designers to be a " showpiece " of the system and built initially with a domed roof . Architectural themes became a more important issue only in subsequent stages , and resulted in such designs as the cylindrical station shapes on all stations between Kallang and Pasir Ris except Eunos , and west of Boon Lay , and the perched roofs at Boon Lay , Lakeside , Chinese Garden , Bukit Batok , Bukit Gombak , Choa Chu Kang , Khatib , Yishun and Eunos stations . 
 Art pieces , where present , are seldom highlighted ; they primarily consist of a few paintings or sculptures representing the recent past of Singapore , mounted in major stations . The opening of the Woodlands Extension introduced bolder pieces of artwork , such as a 4 @,@ 000 kg sculpture in Woodlands . With the opening of the North East Line , more series of artworks created under a programme called " The Art In Transit " were commissioned by the Land Transport Authority . Created by 19 local artists and integrated into the stations ' interior architecture , these works aim to promote the appreciation of public art in high @-@ traffic environments . The artwork for each station is designed to suit the station 's identity . All stations on the North East , Circle and Downtown Lines come under this programme . An art contest was held by the authorities in preparation for a similar scheme to be implemented for the Circle Line . 
 The Expo station , located on the Changi Airport branch of the East West Line , is adjacent to the 100 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ metre Singapore Expo exhibition facility . Designed by Foster and Partners and completed in January 2001 , the station features a large , <unk> , titanium @-@ clad roof in an elliptical shape that sheathes the length of the station platform . This complements a smaller 40 @-@ metre reflective stainless @-@ steel disc overlapping the titanium ellipse and visually floats over a glass elevator shaft and the main entrance . The other station with similar architecture is Dover . 
 Changi Airport , the easternmost station on the MRT network , has the widest platform in any underground MRT station in Singapore . It is rated 10 out of 15 most beautiful subway stops in the world in 2011 . 
 Two Circle Line stations — Bras <unk> and Stadium — were commissioned through the Marina Line Architectural Design Competition , which was jointly organised by the Land Transport Authority and the Singapore Institute of Architects . The competition did not require any architectural experience from competitors , and is acknowledged by the industry as one of the most impartial competitions held in Singapore to date . The winner of both stations was <unk> . In 2009 , " Best Transport Building " was awarded to the designers at <unk> Architects at the World Architecture Festival . 
 = = Expansion = = 
 The MRT system relied on its two main lines , the North South and East West lines , for more than a decade until the opening of the North East Line in 2003 . While plans for these lines as well as those currently under construction were formulated long before , the Land Transport Authority 's publication of a White Paper titled " A World Class Land Transport System " in 1996 galvanised the government 's intentions to greatly expand the system . It called for the expansion of the 67 kilometres of track in 1995 to 360 in 2030 . It was expected that daily ridership in 2030 would grow to 6 @.@ 0 million from the 1 @.@ 4 million passengers at that time 
 The following table lists Mass Rapid Transit lines and stations that are currently under testing , construction , or that are in the planning stages : 
 = = = Downtown Line = = = 
 The 42 @-@ kilometre , 36 station fully underground Downtown Line , will connect the northwestern and eastern regions of Singapore to the new downtown at Marina Bay in the south and to the Central Business District . Similar to the Circle Line , three @-@ car trainsets will run on the Downtown Line with line capacity projected for 500 @,@ 000 commuters daily . The Downtown Line is slated to be completed in three stages . Stage 1 from Bugis to Chinatown began operations on 22 December 2013 . Stage 2 from Bukit Panjang to Rochor began operations on 27 December 2015 . Stage 3 from Fort Canning to Expo will begin operations in 2017 and Stage 3e from Expo to Sungei Bedok in 2024 respectively . 
 = = = Thomson @-@ East Coast Line = = = 
 The 43 @-@ kilometre , 31 station fully underground Thomson @-@ East Coast Line will connect the northern region of Singapore to the south , running parallel to the existing North South Line passing through Woodlands , Sin Ming , Upper Thomson and Marina Bay before turning east and running through Tanjong Rhu , <unk> , Marine Parade and Bedok . The line will commence operation in five stages , with the first three stages starting from Woodlands North to Gardens by the Bay commencing operations between 2019 and 2021 respectively , Stage 4 from Tanjong Rhu to Bayshore in 2023 and Stage 5 from Bedok South to Sungei Bedok in 2024 . The northern terminus of Woodlands North is also expected to interchange with the Singapore @-@ Johor rail link to provide access to Johor Bahru and the future Johor Bahru Rapid Transit System .

It will also connect to all the other major lines to serve as a key transfer line , complementing the role currently fulfilled by the orbital Circle Line . This line will even have a longer timeframe due to the environmental study aspects , with the completion by 2030 .

 To be completed by 2030 , the 2 @-@ kilometre extension will run from Punggol through Punggol North including the new Punggol Downtown . The extension is for future residents in Punggol North to have train access to the city centre as well as other parts of Singapore . 
 = = Fares and ticketing = = 
 Stations are divided into two areas , paid and unpaid , which allow the rail operators to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates , also known as access control gates . These gates , connected to a computer network , can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data , and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip . General Ticketing Machines sell tickets for single trips or allow the customer to buy additional value for stored @-@ value tickets . Tickets for single trips , coloured in green , are valid only on the day of purchase , and have a time allowance of 30 minutes beyond the estimated travelling time . Tickets that can be used repeatedly until their expiry date require a minimum amount of stored credit . 
 As the fare system has been integrated by TransitLink , commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates ( once on entry , once on exit ) for an entire journey , even when transferring between lines operated by different companies . Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid @-@ journey , and pay the difference when they exit their destination station . 
 = = = Fares = = = 
 Because the rail operators are government @-@ assisted , profit @-@ based corporations , fares on the MRT system are pitched to at least break @-@ even level . The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data @-@ storing tickets , the prices of which are calculated based on the distance between the start and destination stations . These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non @-@ discounted travel . Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations , in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems , such as the London Underground . 
 Although operated by private companies , the system 's fare structure is regulated by the Public Transport Council ( PTC ) , to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares . Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance @-@ related bus fares , thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce its heavy reliance on the bus system . Fare increases over the past few years have caused public concern , the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008 . There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit 's North East Line , a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line , as well as lower patronage . 
 = = = Ticketing = = = 
 The ticketing system uses the EZ @-@ Link and NETS FlashPay contactless smart cards based upon the Symphony for e @-@ Payment ( <unk> ) system for public transit built on the Singapore Standard for <unk> <unk> Application ( CEPAS ) system . This system allows for up to 4 card issuers in the market . The EZ @-@ Link card was introduced on 13 April 2002 as a replacement for the original TransitLink farecard , while its competitor the NETS FlashPay card entered the smartcard market on 9 October 2009 . 
 A stored value adult EZ @-@ Link or NETS FlashPay branded CEPAS card may be purchased at any TransitLink Ticket Office or Passenger Service Centre . The CEPAS card may be used for the payment of MRT , LRT and bus fares . The CEPAS card may also be used for payment for goods and services at selected merchants , Electronic Road Pricing tolls , and Electronic Parking System carparks . Additional credit may be purchased via cash or NETS at any General Ticketing Machine ( GTM ) , Add Value Machine , TransitLink Ticket Office , Passenger Service Centre , AXS Station , DBS / <unk> / OCBC / UOB Automatic Teller Machines , online via a card reader purchased separately , or selected merchants . Additional credit of a predetermined value may also be automatically credited into the card when the card value runs low via an automatic recharge service provided by <unk> <unk> or credit card . An Adult Monthly Travel Card for unlimited travel on MRT , LRT and buses may also be purchased and is non @-@ transferable . 
 A Standard Ticket contactless smart card for single or return journeys may also be purchased at the GTM for the payment of MRT and / or LRT fares . A S $ 0 @.@ 10 deposit will be levied on top of the fare to be paid . The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S $ 0 @.@ 10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket . No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys . The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre @-@ selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days . Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored @-@ valued CEPAS ( EZ @-@ Link and NETS FlashPay ) cards for the same distance traveled . The ticket is retained by the user after each journey and does not need to be returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre . Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards , the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit . 
 For tourists , a Singapore Tourist Pass contactless smartcard may be purchased . The card may be bought at selected TransitLink Ticket Offices and Singapore Visitors Centres . The tourists may retrieved their deposit by returning the card to the ticket offices or visitors centres within 5 days from the date of issue . 
 = = Safety and security = = 
 = = = Safety = = = 
 Operators and authorities state that numerous measures had been taken to ensure the safety of passengers , and SBS Transit publicised the safety precautions on the driverless North East Line before and after its opening . Safety campaign posters are highly visible in trains and stations , and the operators frequently broadcast safety announcements to passengers and to commuters waiting for trains . Fire safety standards are consistent with the strict guidelines of the US National Fire Protection Association . 
 There were calls for platform screen doors to be installed at above @-@ ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at above @-@ ground stations . Underground stations already featured platform screen doors since 1987 . The authorities initially rejected the proposal by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs , but made an about @-@ turn when the government announced plans to install half @-@ height platform screen doors on the above @-@ ground stations in January 2008 , citing lower costs due to it becoming a more common feature worldwide . They were first installed at Jurong East , Pasir Ris and Yishun stations in 2009 under trials to test their feasibility . 
 By 14 March 2012 , all elevated stations have been retrofitted with the doors and are operational . These doors prevent suicides and unauthorised access to restricted areas . Under the Rapid Transit Systems Act , acts such as smoking , eating or drinking in stations and trains , the misuse of emergency equipment and trespassing on the railway tracks are illegal , with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment . 
 There were a few major accidents in the history of the MRT that raised safety concerns among the public . On 5 August 1993 , two trains collided at Clementi station because of an oil spillage on the track , which resulted in 132 injuries . During the construction of the Circle Line on 20 April 2004 , a tunnel being constructed under Nicoll Highway collapsed and led to the deaths of four people . The overall reliability of the ageing North South and East West lines were questioned by the public after multiple major train disruptions in December 2011 led to a Committee of Inquiry , which uncovered serious shortcomings in SMRT Corporation 's maintenance regime . Since then , every MRT line had been plagued with disruptions of various degrees of severity . 
 On 7 July 2015 , train services on the North South MRT Line and East West MRT Line in Singapore were suspended in both directions following a major power trip . The disruption lasted for more than 3 hours , affecting 250 @,@ 000 commuters . This was considered the worst disruption to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 . Independent experts from Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into the cause of the disruption . The cause was identified as damage to a third rail insulator due to a water leak at Tanjong Pagar station . Consequently , a program was implemented to replace insulators liable to similar failure . 
 = = = Security = = = 
 Security concerns related to crime and terrorism were not high on the agenda of the system 's planners at its inception . However , after the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT Station in 2001 , the operators deployed private , unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and conduct checks on the belongings of commuters , especially those carrying bulky items . 
 Recorded announcements are frequently made to remind passengers to report suspicious activity and not to leave their belongings unattended . Digital closed @-@ circuit cameras ( CCTVs ) have been upgraded with recording @-@ capability at all stations and trains operated by SMRT Corporation . Trash bins and mail boxes have been removed from station platforms and concourse levels to station entrances , to eliminate the risk of bombs planted in them . Photography without permission was also banned in all MRT stations since the Madrid bombings , but it was not in the official statement in any public transport security reviews . 
 On 14 April 2005 the Singapore Police Force announced plans to step up rail security by establishing a specialised security unit for public transport , the unit today is known as the Public Transport Security Command or more commonly known as <unk> . These armed officers began overt patrols on the MRT and LRT systems on 15 August 2005 , conducting random patrols in pairs in and around rail stations and within trains . They are trained and authorised to use their firearms at their discretion , including deadly force if deemed necessary . On 8 January 2006 , a major civil exercise involving over 2 @,@ 000 personnel from 22 government agencies , codenamed Exercise Northstar V , simulating bombing and chemical attacks at <unk> Ghaut , Toa Payoh , Raffles Place and Marina Bay MRT stations was conducted . Thirteen stations were closed and about 3 @,@ 400 commuters were affected during the three @-@ hour exercise . 
 Security concerns were brought up by the public when two incidents of vandalism at train depots occurred within two years . In both incidents , graffiti on the affected trains were discovered after they entered revenue service . The first incident , on 17 May 2010 , involved a breach in the perimeter fence of Changi Depot and resulted in the imprisonment and caning of a Swiss citizen , and an Interpol arrest warrant for his accomplice . The train involved was a C151 train . SMRT Corporation received a S $ 50 @,@ 000 fine by the Land Transport Authority for the first security breach . Measures were put in place by the Public Transport Security Committee to enhance depot security in light of the first incident , but works were yet to be completed by SMRT Corporation when the second incident , on 17 August 2011 , occurred at Bishan Depot . 
 On 22 November 2012 , the Land Transport Authority carried out a ground deployment exercise with SMRT to test their incident management plans in the event of a train service disruption . In total , about 135 personnel including representatives from the Singapore Police Force 's Transport Command ( <unk> ) and SBS Transit participated in the exercise . Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise . Codenamed ' Exercise Greyhound ' , the exercise went through the scenario of a broken rail on the East West Line at Buona Vista . SMRT had also activated their Rail Incident Management Plan . 
 On 22 August 2013 , ‘ Exercise Greyhound 2013 ’ was carried out by the Land Transport Authority with SBS Transit to validate the procedures of <unk> ’ s Operations Control Centre ( OCC ) and the workability of its contingency plans for bus bridging , free bus service and deployment of Goodwill Ambassadors ( <unk> ) during a simulated prolonged train service disruption . About 300 personnel including representatives from LTA , <unk> , SMRT , the Singapore Police Force ’ s Transport Command ( <unk> ) , Traffic Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force ( <unk> ) participated in the exercise . Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise .

 = A Meeting by the River = 
 A Meeting by the River is an album recorded by Ry Cooder and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt ; it was recorded in September 1992 and released in April 1993 through the record label Water Lily Acoustics . This improvised , collaborative album features Cooder on slide guitar and Bhatt on the Mohan veena , a stringed instrument created by Bhatt . A Meeting by the River was produced by <unk> Alexander and Jayant Shah , engineered by Alexander , and mastered by Kevin Michael Gray and Paul <unk> . It peaked at number four on Billboard 's Top World Music Albums chart , and earned Cooder and Bhatt Grammy Awards for Best World Music Album at the 36th Grammy Awards ( 1994 ) . The album is included in Tom Moon 's 2008 book 1 @,@ 000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die . 
 = = Composition = = 
 A Meeting by the River was recorded in September 1992 ; it features Cooder solely on slide guitar and Bhatt on the Mohan veena , a stringed instrument he created . Allmusic 's Daniel Gioffre described the instrument as a hybrid between a guitar and a <unk> veena ; it is played with a metal slide moving across steel rods along the neck . Cooder had heard a recording of Hindustani classical music performed by Bhatt and was impressed by his playing and the " haunting clarity " of the Mohan veena . Cooder and Bhatt met for the first time less than one hour before recording began ; they improvised much of the set ; the album 's liner notes state , " this recording was unplanned and unrehearsed " . The album was produced by <unk> Alexander , founder of Water Lily Acoustics , and Jayant Shah . It was engineered by Alexander , and was mastered by Kevin Michael Gray and Paul <unk> . Cooder and Bhatt are accompanied by Cooder 's fourteen @-@ year @-@ old son Joachim on <unk> , a Middle Eastern drum , and by Sukhvinder Singh <unk> on tabla . 
 The collaboration between Cooder and Bhatt is Alexander 's first attempt to record musicians of different cultures together , one of his goals when he founded the record label . Author George <unk> described Bhatt 's playing as " highly nuanced " and said , Cooder performs in a more " loose @-@ jointed , slip ' n ' slide style " . According to Gioffre , Cooder and Bhatt use improvisation and " voice @-@ like " phrasing , showing melodic performances in an alternating fashion and in unison . The album contains four tracks , three of which are credited to Cooder and Bhatt ; tracks range in duration from approximately seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes to twelve minutes . " Longing " has a structure similar to a raga . Author Tom Moon said Cooder takes the lead on the hymn " Isa Lei " as Bhatt contributes " elaborate <unk> asides " and " swooping <unk> " . In 2011 , Bhatt performed " A Meeting by the River " at a music festival in honor of guru Kelucharan Mohapatra . Bhatt said of the song , " Music has no religion and no geographical or linguistic barrier . It speaks a universal language . My composition – ' A Meeting by the River ' – aims at explaining this . " Bhatt has said he considers working with Cooder his " most special " collaboration . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Gioffre wrote a positive review of the album and called Cooder and Bhatt " genuine masters " of their respective instruments . He described the musical interplay between the musicians as " nothing short of astounding " and the album as a rare instance in which a combination of genres works . Gioffre also wrote , " this album is masterfully recorded ; each instrument is clear , distinct , and three @-@ dimensional sounding . A Meeting by the River is a must @-@ own , a thing of pure , unadulterated beauty , and the strongest record in Cooder 's extensive catalog . " Peter Margasak of the Chicago Tribune awarded the album four stars out of four , describing Cooder 's performance as " arresting " and Bhatt 's as " haunting " . Margasak wrote that the fusion revealed a " rare , often transcendental beauty " as the two artists " gently and intuitively " found common ground . Rolling Stone called the album " fruitful " and awarded it three stars out of five . 
 = = Chart performance and recognition = = 
 A Meeting by the River reached a peak position of number four on Billboard 's Top World Music Albums chart . In 1994 , the album earned Cooder and Bhatt Grammy Awards for Best World Music Album . Bhatt became one of a few Indian musicians to have received a Grammy Award until A. R. Rahman won at the 52nd Grammy Awards in 2010 . Previous Indian award winners had been recognized jointly with Western artists . The February 25 , 1995 , issue of Billboard , which featured the annual " Indies Spotlight " and covered independent music between the January 29 , 1994 , and January 21 , 1995 , issues of the magazine included A Meeting by the River at number ten on its list of the " Top Indie World Music Albums " .

 = Effects of Hurricane Dennis in Jamaica = 
 In early July 2005 , Hurricane Dennis brushed Jamaica , bringing torrential rain and damaging floods to the island nation . Forming from a tropical depression on July 4 , Dennis began impacting Jamaica three days later . Approximately 6 @,@ 000 people evacuated from coastal and flood @-@ prone areas prior to the storm 's arrival while relief agencies allocated resources for recovery operations . Passing northeast of the island , impact from Dennis stemmed primarily from rainfall — accumulations peaked at 24 @.@ 54 in ( 623 mm ) and reached 1 @-@ in @-@ 50 year event levels . Widespread flooding and landslides damaged homes and isolated communities . Saint Thomas and Portland Parishes were hardest @-@ hit ; hundreds required evacuation as multiple rivers burst their banks . 
 Overall , 209 @,@ 000 people were affected with 6 @,@ 000 households requesting assistance . A week after Dennis , Hurricane Emily brought further rain to the island , exacerbating damage . Their combined effects damaged or destroyed 440 homes with total losses reaching J $ 5 @.@ 976 billion ( US $ 96 @.@ 87 million ) , of which at least J $ 2 @.@ 128 billion ( US $ 34 @.@ 5 million ) can be attributed to Dennis alone . One person died due to flooding . Relief operations began before the hurricane subsided , and international communities provided further aid . The overall effects of Dennis were limited and the nation 's economy sustained no major ramifications . 
 = = Background and preparations = = 
 On July 4 , 2005 , the National Hurricane Center classified a tropical depression near the Windward Islands . This system moved briskly to the west @-@ northwest , becoming Tropical Storm Dennis the following day . Taking advantage of highly favorable environmental factors , such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures , Dennis rapidly intensified . By July 6 , the system reached hurricane strength as it began traversing the Jamaica Channel . Around 18 : 00 UTC on July 7 , the hurricane passed 30 mi ( 45 km ) northeast of Port Antonio — 60 mi ( 95 km ) northeast of Kingston — with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) — a Category 3 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . The system subsequently struck Cuba as a Category 4 twice before moving over the Gulf of Mexico . It ultimately moved inland over Florida as a Category 3 on July 10 and dissipated over the Great Lakes eight days later . 
 Late on July 5 , the Government of Jamaica issued a hurricane watch for the nation as Dennis intensified over the eastern Caribbean . This was upgraded to a hurricane warning early on July 6 . The warning remained in place for 48 hours as the hurricane brushed the island , being discontinued on July 8 as Dennis moved over northern Cuba and no longer posed a direct threat to Jamaica . 
 Following the issuance of the hurricane warning , Jamaica 's National Emergency Operations Center and Parish Emergency Operations Center were activated . At the behest of Jamaica 's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management , the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency allocated resources to assist the nation following the passage of Dennis . The Jamaican Red Cross also notified its branches of the storm , placing personnel and volunteers on standby on July 7 . The Jamaica Defence Force Coast Guard assisted with evacuations of Pedro Bank and Morant Cays . Shelters prepped for opening by the evening of July 6 and Norman Manley International Airport ceased operations at 04 : 00 UTC ( 11 : 00 p.m. local time ) and Sangster International Airport following soon thereafter . 
 By July 7 , 30 shelters opened across five parishes , with at least 793 people using their services . Some officials complained that residents refused to evacuate . However , as the storm impacted the island this number dramatically increased to 6 @,@ 000 people with shelters open in all parishes . Approximately J $ 25 million ( US $ 405 @,@ 000 ) was made available for relief operations through the nation 's Disaster Mitigation Programme . An additional J $ 20 million ( US $ 324 @,@ 000 ) was allocated for clearing drains in preparation for heavy rain . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Hurricane Dennis brought torrential rainfall to most of Jamaica , which already experienced above @-@ average rainfall since April , as it brushed the island to the northeast . Many places recorded over 12 in ( 300 mm ) of rain , with the highest totals occurring across the Blue Mountains ; accumulations peaked at 24 @.@ 54 in ( 623 mm ) in Mavis Bank . One @-@ hour rainfall rates reached 2 @.@ 6 in ( 65 mm ) in this location with a twenty @-@ four @-@ hour peak of 19 @.@ 59 in ( 497 @.@ 6 mm ) . The latter value equates to a 1 @-@ in @-@ 50 year event for the town and was 1 @,@ 005 % of the 30 @-@ year mean . Rainfall in Constant Spring reached 1 @-@ in @-@ 25 year levels . Sustained winds in Montego Bay peaked at 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) , equivalent to a strong tropical storm . Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston observed peak winds of 37 mph ( 60 km / h ) with a gust to 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) . These winds downed trees and power lines , leaving roughly 100 @,@ 000 customers without electricity ; however , overall wind damage was minimal . Several homes and business lost their roofs . 
 Saint Thomas Parish suffered widespread flooding as multiple rivers burst their banks . The first to flood was the Yallahs River . A bridge spanning the river was severely damaged . The nearby <unk> River prompted multiple evacuations in Yallahs while Johnson River flooded much of Seaforth . Evacuations also took place in Bull Bay where graves were unearthed . Sixty @-@ seven homes in the Taylor Land subdivision of Bull Bay were affected , prompting a proposal to relocate residents elsewhere to avoid future damage . Overflow from tributaries of the Cane River inundated multiple villages , leaving many isolated . One person drowned after being swept away in the Negro River ; his body was recovered three days later . Approximately 200 homes in the parish suffered inundation — including several illegally built structures which were destroyed — with residents reporting maximum flood depths of 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . The community of Eight Miles remained under 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) a day after the hurricane 's passage . The severity of flooding was blamed on poor building and maintenance of retaining walls along gullies . 
 Landslides in Portland Parish rendered roads impassable and damaged many homes . A bridge spanning the Rio Grande , connecting eastern and western sides of the parish , was severely damaged . The severed connection left 500 people temporarily isolated . Elsewhere along the river , three homes and two stores were swept away . A landslide in Mill Bank destroyed eight homes . Agriculture sustained significant damage , with effects compounded by the quick succession of Dennis and Emily a week apart . Along the Rio Grande , the entire banana crop was lost . The two storms wrecked 626 ha ( 1 @,@ 550 acres ) of crops and killed 4 @,@ 330 livestock , mostly chickens , at a cost of J $ 250 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 05 million ) . 
 Two homes along the <unk> River in Saint Andrew Parish were swept away while other residents in mountainous areas of the parish were stranded by landslides . Multiple residents became trapped within Gordon Town and hazardous weather hampered their rescue . A bridge in <unk> was destroyed . During the pre @-@ dawn hours of July 9 , the Annotto , <unk> , and <unk> rivers burst their banks in Saint Mary Parish ; more than 500 people relocated from their homes in Annotto Bay . Flooding took place across much of Saint Catherine Parish with eight people requiring rescue . The <unk> Gully submerged several homes in Bushy Park . Eastern areas of Clarendon Parish experienced significant flooding , with several communities cut @-@ off or inundated . A sink hole in Halse Hall engulfed 35 homes . An oil tank overflowed due to heavy rain at a <unk> Refinery in Kingston Harbour resulting in a minor oil spill . <unk> crews cleaned the spill within a day . Some streets in downtown Kingston were flooded . Effects in Trelawny Parish were relatively limited , with J $ 16 million ( US $ 259 @,@ 000 ) in agricultural damage . 
 In all , an estimated 209 @,@ 000 people were affected to varying degrees across 121 communities in the nation . Approximately 6 @,@ 000 households — an estimated 22 @,@ 000 people — reported need for assistance ; the combined effects of Dennis and Emily left 49 homes destroyed and 391 damaged . Associated losses reached J $ 100 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 62 million ) from Dennis . The agricultural industry sustained extensive losses , with 610 ha ( 1 @,@ 500 acres ) damaged and nearly 160 @,@ 000 livestock , primarily chickens , killed . The rapid succession of Dennis and Emily makes differentiating damage between them difficult . Collectively , the two storms wrought J $ 5 @.@ 976 billion ( US $ 96 @.@ 87 million ) in damage , primarily stemming from infrastructure , of which at least J $ 2 @.@ 128 billion ( US $ 34 @.@ 5 million ) can be attributed to Dennis alone . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Distribution of relief supplies began on July 7 . Isolated communities across Saint Andrew , Saint Thomas , and Portland Parishes received airlifted aid the following day . Residents in Cascade required evacuation by airlift and Mill Bank was declared a disaster area . A previously defunct railway bridge — the 500 ft ( 150 m ) St. Margaret 's Bay bridge — in Portland Parish , not in use since the 1980s , was repaired at a cost of J $ 26 million ( US $ 421 @,@ 000 ) and re @-@ opened on July 30 to enable travel after the Rio Grande bridge was damaged . Residents in the parish were also advised to temporarily boil or bleach water to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases due to contaminated supplies . The Salvation Army assisted with relief efforts . Efforts to repair and restore damaged roadways reached J $ 405 million ( US $ 6 @.@ 56 million ) . The Leader of the Opposition party requested the Jamaican government release J $ 500 million ( US $ 8 @.@ 1 million ) for immediate relief ; however , Prime Minister P. J. Patterson rejected the proposal . Joseph Hibbert further criticized the government for inadequately maintaining roads , citing a lack of maintenance contracts which is how such work is carried out in the nation . Although the Government of Jamaica indicated it would not request international assistance , the Government of Cuba provided 11 tons of supplies and Venezuela offered support . 
 <unk> reported a loss of 10 @,@ 000 tons of aluminum due to flooding . Manufacturing companies reported J $ 18 @.@ 3 million ( US $ 296 @,@ 000 ) in losses , primarily from suspended operations . In November , the Jamaica Labour Party sought J $ 3 @.@ 2 billion ( US $ 51 @.@ 8 million ) in additional funding to repair roads damaged by Hurricanes Ivan , Dennis , Emily , and Wilma . The following month , the Jamaica Agricultural Society received J $ 5 @.@ 5 million ( US $ 88 @,@ 266 ) from the Japanese embassy to assist 500 farmers in Portland Parish . The long @-@ term effects of Dennis were limited , with nearly every economic sector returning to normal within a few months . The only exceptions were exports of banana and coffee crops , both of which were still recovering from Hurricane Ivan in 2004 . Overall implications to the nation 's gross domestic product were negligible , merely flat @-@ lining growth rather than causing decline . However , in combination with the effects of a drought early in 2005 , inflation values required adjustment upwards from 9 % to 14 @.@ 3 % . 
 = The Boat Race 1846 = 
 The 8th Boat Race between crews from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge took place on the River Thames on 3 April 1846 . Umpired by Charles Jasper Selwyn , Cambridge won in a time of 21 minutes 5 seconds , with a winning margin of three lengths . The race was held on the ebb tide , starting in Mortlake and ending in Putney . For the first time , outriggers were used by both crews .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . 
 Following their ten @-@ length defeat in the previous year 's race , Oxford sent their challenge to Cambridge in February 1846 , proposing that the race should take place at Easter . The umpire for the race was Charles Jasper Selwyn . Cambridge went into the race leading the contest overall , with five wins to Oxford 's two since the inaugural race in 1829 . On one of only a handful of occasions , the race was rowed on the ebb tide , from Mortlake to Putney . 
 For the first time in the history of the race , both boats used outriggers . Cambridge " rowed in an outrigger built by Searle , 60 ft in length , 2 ft 8 in in breadth " , while Oxford 's boat was " expressly built for this match by King of Oxford " and 58 ft 6 in long . Both crews had professional coaches : Oxford used John <unk> while Cambridge were trained by Robert Coombes , a champion sculler . It marked the start of the debate over the use of professional coaches which was not resolved until the 1852 race .

Despite taking an early lead , Oxford were soon caught and Cambridge drew away , holding a third @-@ of @-@ a @-@ length lead by Chiswick . As the long bend began to favour Oxford , Cambridge slowed in shallow water allowing the Dark Blues to close some of the discrepancy , but by Hammersmith Bridge , Cambridge were back to a half @-@ length lead .

The depictions range from the realistic , as in the television documentaries of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century , or the fantastic , as in the monster movies of the 1950s and 1960s . 
 The growth in interest in dinosaurs since the Dinosaur Renaissance has been accompanied by depictions made by artists working with ideas at the leading edge of dinosaur science , presenting lively dinosaurs and feathered dinosaurs as these concepts were first being considered . Cultural depictions of dinosaurs have been an important means of translating scientific discoveries to the public . 
 Cultural depictions have also created or reinforced misconceptions about dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals , such as inaccurately and anachronistically portraying a sort of " prehistoric world " where many kinds of extinct animals ( from the Permian animal Dimetrodon to mammoths and cavemen ) lived together , and dinosaurs living lives of constant combat . 
 Other misconceptions reinforced by cultural depictions came from a scientific consensus that has now been overturned , such as the alternate usage of dinosaur to describe something that is <unk> or obsolete , or dinosaurs as slow and unintelligent .

 The classical folklorist Adrienne Mayor has proposed that the griffin of mythology is based on dinosaur skeletons found in the Gobi Desert . She noted that griffins were said to inhabit the Scythian steppes that reached from the modern Ukraine to central Asia . Mayor draws a connection to Protoceratops , a frilled dinosaur that was commonly found in the Gobi . This dinosaur has features associated with griffins : they share sharp beaks , four legs , claws , similar size , and large eyes ( or eye sockets in the case of the fossils ) , and the neck frill of Protoceratops , with large open holes , is consistent with descriptions of large ears or wings . However , the palaeontologist Mark Witton notes that the suggestion ignores pre @-@ Mycenaean accounts , and has not found favour with archaeologists including N. Wyatt and T.F. <unk> . 
 The scientific study of dinosaurs began in the 1820s of England . In 1842 , Richard Owen coined the term dinosaur , which under his vision were elephantine reptiles . An ambitious scientist who used dinosaurs and other fossils to promote his beliefs , Owen was the driving force for the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures , the first large @-@ scale dinosaur reconstructions that were accessible to the public ( 1854 ) . These sculptures , which can still be seen today , immortalized a very early stage in the perception of dinosaurs . 
 The Crystal Palace sculptures were successful enough that Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins , Owen 's collaborator , sold models of his sculptures and planned a second exhibition , Paleozoic Museum , for Central Park in Manhattan in the late 1860s ; it was never completed due to the interference of local politics and " Boss " William Marcy Tweed . 
 In the same period , dinosaurs first appeared in popular literature , with a passing mention of an Owen @-@ style Megalosaurus in Charles Dickens 's Bleak House ( 1852 – 1853 ) . However , depictions of dinosaurs were rare in the 19th century , possibly due to incomplete knowledge . Despite the well @-@ publicized " Bone Wars " of the late 19th century between the American palaeontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh , dinosaurs were not yet ingrained in culture . Marsh , although a pioneer of skeletal reconstructions , did not support putting mounted skeletons on display , and derided the Crystal Palace sculptures .

 As study caught up to the wealth of new material from western North America , and venues for depictions proliferated , dinosaurs gained in popularity . The paintings of Charles R. Knight were the first influential representations of these finds . Knight worked extensively with the American Museum of Natural History and its director , Henry Fairfield Osborn , who wanted to use dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals to promote his museum and his ideas on evolution . 
 Knight ’ s work , found in museums around the country , helped popularize dinosaurs and influenced generations of paleoartists . Interestingly , his early work showing fighting " Laelaps " ( = Dryptosaurus ) depicted dinosaurs as much more lively than they would be presented for much of the 20th century . At the same time , improvements in casting allowed dinosaur skeletons to be reproduced and shipped across the world for display in far @-@ flung museums , bringing them to the attention of a wider audience ; Diplodocus was the first such dinosaur reproduced in this way . 
 Dinosaurs began appearing in films soon after the introduction of cinema , the first being the good @-@ natured animated Gertie the Dinosaur in 1914 . However , lovable dinosaurs were quickly replaced by monsters as moviemakers recognized the potential of huge frightening monsters . D. W. Griffith in 1914 ’ s Brute Force provided the first example of a threatening cinematic dinosaur , a Ceratosaurus who menaced cavemen . This film enshrined the fiction that dinosaurs and early humans lived together , and set up the cliché that dinosaurs were bloodthirsty and attacked anything that moved . 
 The now @-@ common trope of dinosaurs existing in isolated locations in today ’ s world appeared at the same time , with Arthur Conan Doyle 's 1912 book The Lost World and the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs as pioneers . The Lost World crossed into the movies in 1925 , setting heights for special effects and attempts at scientific accuracy . It is unusual , even today , for attempting to portray dinosaurs as something other than monsters that spent their lives in combat . 
 The stop @-@ motion techniques of Willis O 'Brien went on to bring dinosaurs to life in the 1933 film King Kong , which merged the tropes of dinosaur combat and dinosaurs in a lost world . His protégé Ray Harryhausen would continue to refine this method , but most later dinosaurs movies until the advent of CGI would eschew such expensive effects for cheaper methods , such as humans in dinosaur suits , modern reptiles enlarged by cinematography , and reptiles with dinosaur decorations . Dinosaur depictions diversified in the 1930s , spreading to newspaper comic strips in Alley <unk> and to advertising for Sinclair Oil . 
 = = = The 1930s to 1970s : Moribund dinosaurs to renaissance = = = 
 The Great Depression and World War II combined to sink the study of dinosaurs into a decades @-@ long lull . Scientists considered dinosaurs a group of unrelated animals that left no descendants , and dinosaurs were presented as stupid , slow , stuck in swamps , and doomed to extinction . Scientific dinosaur artwork , primarily from Rudolph F. Zallinger and Zdeněk Burian , reflected and reinforced the conception of dinosaurs as slow and static ( one artistic quirk that became commonplace in representations of Mesozoic landscapes , the presence of a volcano , was a hallmark of Zallinger 's ) . From such ideas came the alternate definition of “ dinosaur ” as something out of date . 
 Films of the time typically used dinosaurs as monsters , with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War . Thus , The Beast from 20 @,@ 000 Fathoms ( 1953 ) and Godzilla ( 1954 ; American release 1956 ) portray monstrous dinosaur @-@ like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests . An alternative appears in Disney ’ s animated Fantasia ( 1940 ) , in its The Rite of Spring sequence , which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy ( although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time ) . 
 In 1956 , Oliver Butterworth authored a children 's book , The Enormous Egg . The book and a movie adaptation televised in 1968 by the NBC Children 's Theatre tell the story of a boy who finds an enormous egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby Triceratops . The dinosaur , named Uncle Beazley , becomes too big , so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C. Beasley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History , but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo 's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia . 
 Dinosaurs gained a home in television in the 1960s animated sitcom The Flintstones , in another example of dinosaurs shown as coexisting with humans ( for comedic effect in this case ) . Dinosaurs also entered comic books in this period in such series as Tor and Turok , where prehistoric humans fought anachronistic dinosaurs . For those wanting more scientific accounts of dinosaurs , there were the first <unk> dinosaur books . Ned Colbert ’ s The Dinosaur Book ( 1945 ) was the first such book , and its status as the only such book for many years made Colbert an important figure for the coming generations of paleontologists and dinosaur enthusiasts . 
 In the 1960s , paleontologist John Ostrom began work on the theropod Deinonychus . His findings , which were expanded upon by his student Robert T. Bakker , contributed to the Dinosaur Renaissance , a revolution in the study of dinosaurs . Of particular importance were a reevaluation of the origin of birds that showed them to be closely related to coelurosaurian dinosaurs , reappraisal of dinosaur physiology that suggested they weren ’ t the sluggish cold @-@ blooded animals they ’ d long been assumed to be , and a recognition that dinosaurs formed a natural group . 
 Soon thereafter came new evidence on dinosaur social behavior , with nests of Maiasaura suggesting parental care . These findings were reflected in the work of a new generation of paleoartists . One milestone was Sarah Landry 's feathered dinosaur in Bakker 's 1975 Scientific American article , Dinosaur Renaissance . 
 Louis Paul Jonas created the first full sized dinosaur sculptures for the 1964 New York World 's Fair in the " <unk> " area , which was sponsored by the Sinclair Oil Corporation , whose logo featured a dinosaur . Jonas consulted with paleontologists Barnum Brown , Edwin H. Colbert and John Ostrom in order to create nine sculptures that were as accurate as possible . After the Fair closed , the dinosaur models toured the country on flatbed trailers as part of a company advertising campaign . Most of the statues are now on display at various museums and parks . 
 In 1967 , the Sinclair Oil Corporation gave one of its dinosaurs , a fiberglass model of a Triceratops , to the Smithsonian Institution . The model , which appeared in the The Enormous Egg television movie in 1968 as Uncle Beazley , is now on display at the National Zoo . From the 1970s to 1994 , the statue was located on the National Mall in front of the National Museum of Natural History . ( Some sources state that the Kentucky Science Center in Louisville ( formerly named the " Louisville Museum of Natural History and Science " and the " Louisville Science Center " ) now owns the Triceratops model ) . 
 = = = The 1980s to the present : Dinosaurs reconsidered = = = 
 The reevaluation of dinosaurs spurred public interest , with the new generation of paleoartists quick to respond . Artists such as Mark Hallett , Doug Henderson , John <unk> , Gregory S. Paul , William Stout , and Bob Walters illustrated the new findings in response to the demand . 
 By the latter half of the 1980s and into the 1990s , other media were showing the influence of the increased popularity , with diverse depictions aimed at a variety of ages and interests . 
 In 1990 the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. , featured an exhibition of dinosaur sculpture by Jim Gary that drew more visitors than any of its previous exhibits . His Twentieth Century Dinosaurs , popular since the 1960s , began being featured in textbooks , encyclopedias , and videos as well as later , by the likes of National Geographic , in their publications for children in 1975 . 
 For preschoolers , there was the educational television show Barney & Friends starting in 1992 ; their older siblings had the 1988 animated movie The Land Before Time and its increasing line of direct to video sequels ( 12 by 2008 ) . Dinosaurs , a television sitcom , parodied humans and other television shows . Of particular note is Michael Crichton ’ s 1990 novel , Jurassic Park , the popularity of which led to a series of films and other media . The first of these , Jurassic Park , married advanced CGI with advances in scientific knowledge of dinosaurs . Dinosaur was the most expensive movie in 2000 , but was a box @-@ office success . The falling cost of computer @-@ generated effects also has recently allowed the increased production of documentaries for television ; the award @-@ winning 1999 BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs , the 2001 When Dinosaurs <unk> America , the 2009 Animal Armageddon , and the 2011 Planet Dinosaur are notable examples . 
 In April 2016 , a proposal was submitted to the Unicode committee to encode three pictures of heads of three dinosaur species considered exemplary as emoji . 
 = = Public perception of dinosaurs = = 
 The popular ideals of dinosaurs have many misconceptions , reinforced by films , books , comics , television shows , and even theme parks . Typical errors include : prehistoric humans living with dinosaurs ; dinosaurs as monsters that did little else but fight ; the portrayal of a kind of " prehistoric world " where all prehistoric animals are shown to exist ; dinosaurs as all large ; dinosaurs as stupid and slow ; dinosaurs as being lizard @-@ like and all scaled ( non @-@ feathered ) ; the inclusion of many prehistoric animals ( such as Dimetrodon , ichthyosaurs , mosasaurs , pterosaurs , and plesiosaurs ) as dinosaurs ; and dinosaurs as failures . 
 Reports in the news media of dinosaur finds and dinosaur science are often inaccurate and sensationalistic , and popular dinosaur books usually lag scientific understanding . Dinosaur toys and models are often inaccurate , packaged indiscriminately with other prehistoric animals , or have fictitious additions like the large sharp teeth in some rubber Triceratops toys . 
 The pejorative use of " dinosaur " as something behind the times has been applied to people , styles , and ideas that are perceived to be out of date , and on the wane . For example , members of the punk movement derided the " progressive " bands that preceded them as " dinosaur bands " . 
 However , some popular <unk> have strived for accuracy and presented up @-@ to @-@ date information ; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson ( of Calvin and Hobbes ) are two recent examples . <unk> and illustrators in particular have kept up with research . Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people , and have been responsible for introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field . In addition , popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works . 
 = = = Usage = = = 
 The typical use of dinosaurs in popular culture has been as vicious monsters . There are several distinct genres of dinosaur depictions commonly used : " lost worlds " on modern Earth ; time travel stories ; educational works for children ; prehistoric world stories ( often with cavemen ) ; and dinosaurs running amok in the modern world .

 The appeal of dinosaurs , as suggested by author , researcher , and dinosaur enthusiast Donald F. Glut , has multiple factors .

Finally , they appeal to adults nostalgic for what they enjoyed as children . Children have been particularly drawn to dinosaurs over the years . 
 = Adolfo Farsari = 
 Adolfo Farsari ( Italian pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 11 February 1841 – 7 February 1898 ) was an Italian photographer based in Yokohama , Japan . His studio , the last notable foreign @-@ owned studio in Japan , was one of the country 's largest and most prolific commercial photographic firms . Largely due to Farsari 's exacting technical standards and his entrepreneurial abilities it had a significant influence on the development of photography in Japan . 
 Following a brief military career , including service in the American Civil War , he became a successful entrepreneur and commercial photographer . His photographic work was highly regarded , particularly his hand @-@ coloured portraits and landscapes , which he sold mostly to foreign residents and visitors to the country . 
 Farsari 's images were widely distributed , presented or mentioned in books and periodicals , and sometimes recreated by artists in other media ; they shaped foreign perceptions of the people and places of Japan and to some degree affected how Japanese saw themselves and their country . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Adolfo Farsari was born in Vicenza , Lombardy @-@ Venetia ( then part of the Austrian Empire , now in Italy ) . He began a career in the Italian military in 1859 but emigrated to the United States in 1863 and , a fervent abolitionist , Farsari served with the Union Army as a New York State Volunteer Cavalry trooper until the end of the American Civil War . He married an American , but the marriage failed and in 1873 he left his wife and two children and moved to Japan . 
 Based in Yokohama , Farsari formed a partnership with E. A. Sargent . Their firm , Sargent , Farsari & Co . , dealt in smokers ' supplies , stationery , visiting cards , newspapers , magazines and novels , Japanese and English conversation books , dictionaries , guidebooks , maps , and photographic views of Japan . The creator of these photographs remains unknown , but Farsari was the maker of at least some of the maps , notably of <unk> ( in the Hakone resort area ) and Yokohama . After his partnership with Sargent ended , the company , now A. Farsari & Co . , published successive editions of Keeling 's Guide to Japan and Farsari himself wrote and published Japanese Words and Phrases for the Use of Strangers . The firm was among the most prolific publishers of materials to aid travellers , having produced its first guidebook to Japan by July 1880 . 
 = = Photographic career and studio = = 
 Farsari expanded his business interests into commercial photography and taught himself photography in 1883 . In 1885 he formed a partnership with photographer Tamamura <unk> to acquire the Stillfried & Andersen studio ( also known as the Japan Photographic Association ) , which had some 15 Japanese employees . The studio 's stock included images by Felice Beato that it had acquired along with Beato 's studio in 1877 . It is not clear how long the partnership of Tamamura and Farsari lasted , for within a few years they were in competition with each other . Farsari further expanded his business in 1885 when the Yokohama Photographic Company ( owned by David Welsh ) folded and Farsari acquired its premises ( next door to his own ) and moved in . In addition to his Yokohama studio , Farsari likely had agents in Kobe and Nagasaki . By the end of 1886 , Farsari and Chinese photographer Tong Cheong were the only foreign commercial photographers still operating in Japan , and by the following year even Tong Cheong had gone . 
 In February 1886 a fire destroyed all of Farsari 's negatives , and he then toured Japan for five months taking new photographs to replace them . He reopened his studio in 1887 . Despite his losses in the fire , by 1889 Farsari 's stock comprised about 1 @,@ 000 Japanese landscapes and genre portraits . 
 Following the innovations of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried , Farsari further developed the trade in photograph albums . His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand @-@ coloured and mounted on album leaves . These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory , mother @-@ of @-@ pearl and gold . Like his contemporaries , Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images , often in white lettering on a black background . 
 Farsari sold many of these photograph albums , particularly to foreign residents and visitors . He employed excellent artists who each produced high @-@ quality work at a pace of two or three hand @-@ coloured prints per day . Farsari ensured that the colours were true to life and that the best materials were used . Accordingly , his work was expensive , yet popular and often praised by clients and visitors to Japan , even receiving a glowing reference by Rudyard Kipling following his 1889 visit to Yokohama . That same year , Farsari presented a deluxe photograph album to the King of Italy . By the 1890s , the studio 's high reputation earned it exclusive rights to photograph the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo . 
 Prospective <unk> at A. Farsari & Co. were interviewed by Farsari himself , who ensured they were familiar with Japanese painting techniques . Once hired , they were given unpaid instruction for several months , and then a basic salary that steadily increased as Farsari became satisfied with their work . A capable and loyal colourist could earn twice the rate offered at other Yokohama studios and double his own daily rate for work on Sundays . Colourists also received regular bonuses and gifts . On the other hand , Farsari complained in a letter to his sister that to motivate his employees he had to rage , swear and beat them , which he did according to a fixed schedule . By 1891 A. Farsari & Co. had 32 employees , 19 of whom were hand @-@ colouring artists . 
 In 1885 Farsari had a daughter , Kiku , by a Japanese woman whom he may not have married . He described himself as living like a misanthrope , associating with very few people outside of business , and his correspondence indicates that he increasingly hoped to return to Italy . He tried to regain the Italian citizenship lost when he emigrated to the United States , and he even hoped to be made a <unk> and thereby join the Italian aristocracy . His success in these endeavours is not clear . Nevertheless , in April 1890 he and his daughter left Japan for Italy . On 7 February 1898 Farsari died in his family home in Vicenza . 
 Following Farsari 's departure from Japan in 1890 , his studio continued to operate and even listed him as proprietor until 1901 , when Tonokura <unk> became the owner . Tonokura , whom Farsari had known since the mid @-@ 1870s , had long managed the day @-@ to @-@ day operations of the studio . In 1904 Tonokura left the business to start his own studio and another of Farsari 's former employees , Watanabe <unk> , became the new owner , only to be succeeded by the former secretary , Fukagawa <unk> . The business was finally registered as a Japanese company in 1906 and it continued to operate until at least 1917 and possibly as late as 1923 , the year in which Yokohama was largely destroyed by the Great Kantō earthquake . A. Farsari & Co. was the last notable foreign @-@ owned photographic studio to operate in Japan . 
 = = Farsari and Yokohama shashin = = 
 Farsari expressed his view of photography in a letter to his sister , writing , " taking pictures is just a mechanical thing . " In describing his development as a photographer , he wrote , " I have had no real teachers , I have learned everything from books . I bought all the necessary equipment and with no help from anyone , I printed , took photographs and so on . Then I taught others . " 
 Farsari did not work in isolation . The works ( particularly those that were hand @-@ coloured ) and practices of the many foreign and Japanese commercial photographers who operated in Yokohama from the 1860s to the 1880s have been termed Yokohama shashin ( literally , " Yokohama photographs " or " photography " ) . Farsari and its other practitioners – notably Beato , Stillfried , Tamamura , Kusakabe <unk> , Ogawa <unk> , and Uchida <unk> – produced works that in their subject matter , composition and colouring present a striking combination of the conventions and techniques of Western photography with those of Japanese artistic traditions , particularly ukiyo @-@ e . These photographers also provided the key images by which Meiji @-@ era Japan and the Japanese were known to people in other countries . Their images also changed the ways in which Japanese saw their own country . Through their images , foreign photographers publicised sites that interested them , sometimes drawing Japanese attention to hitherto neglected locations . One was the now @-@ important " Daibutsu " ( great Buddha ) at <unk> @-@ in , Kamakura . In a similar vein , Farsari 's and others ' photographs of the mausoleums of <unk> @-@ <unk> made the once restricted site familiar to a wider audience . 
 Farsari and other 19th @-@ century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter : the scenery of Japan and the " manners and customs " of its inhabitants . Such subjects , and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed , were chosen to appeal to foreign taste ; and the reason for this , apart from the photographer 's individual aesthetics , vision and preconceptions , had much to do with economics . Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy . In 1870s Japan , a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō " per head " , about a month 's pay for an artisan . Given such pricing , few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer 's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves : colonial administrators , missionaries , merchants and the military . By the early 1870s , tourists had joined their number . To appeal to this clientele , photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed , particularly the portraits depicting " manners and customs " . 
 In 1885 , Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari 's views to illustrate his travel account Land of the Rising Sun , Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese . As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy , it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs . For example , Charles Wirgman 's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman 's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato . Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt : Louis @-@ Jules Dumoulin 's 1888 oil painting Boys ' Festival from the Bluff , Yokohama [ sic ] ( now called Carp Banners in Kyoto ) draws heavily from Farsari 's photograph <unk> , <unk> ( now often called View of Shijō @-@ <unk> , Kyoto ) ; although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source , the location of the subject has been changed in the title . 
 During the era of the collodion process , before the arrival of less demanding photographic technology ( the gelatin silver process , photographic film , and smaller cameras ) and the consequent rise of amateur photography , commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views . In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior , and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas . By 1889 , however , Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers ; even if this was an exaggeration , the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously having an impact on the commercial photography business . To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise , Farsari provided free use of a darkroom . 
 Attribution is often difficult with Farsari 's photographs because 19th @-@ century photographers frequently acquired each others ' images and sold them under their own names . This may be due to the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers , or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio . Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato , Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe . A case in point is the photograph of an Officer 's Daughter , variously attributed to Farsari , Stillfried , Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin 'ichi . 
 The lifetime of A. Farsari & Co. spanned the transition of Japanese photography from the early involvement and influence of foreign photographers to the emergence of an independent , native Japanese photographic identity . Coming after the first generation of photographers , the firm made significant contributions to the development of commercial photography in Japan by emphasising the excellence of materials , refining the practice of presenting photographs in albums ( which became art objects in themselves ) , and making effective use of Farsari 's own tourist @-@ oriented publications to promote his photographic studio 's work – an early , minor example of vertical integration . 
 = = Evaluations of his work = = 
 In its time , the work of A. Farsari & Co. was highly regarded and popular . Besides Kipling 's endorsement , photographer and prolific photography writer W. K. Burton published an appraisal in an 1887 article : " I have seen no better work in the way of coloured photographs anywhere than some of Farsari 's productions " . In the same year , an admiring review of Farsari 's work appeared in the journal Photographic Times and American Photographer , describing it as " technically almost perfect " and showing " artistic proportion " in the selection of subjects , depicting Japanese life and providing images of the natural beauty of a country that was admittedly unfamiliar to Americans . 
 Later opinions have been divided . In a 1988 article , art and photography historian Ellen Handy described A. Farsari & Co. as having become " well @-@ known for issuing albums of landscape views in great quantity , but without regard for print quality and delicacy of hand @-@ colouring " . Terry Bennett , a specialist in the early photography of Asia , refers to Farsari 's work as " inconsistent and lacking the quality found in the photography of Beato , Stillfried or Kusakabe . " But Bennett also notes that Farsari employed excellent artists , used the best paper and produced some " stunningly coloured photographs " . For historian Sebastian Dobson , the artistic and historical significance of the work of Farsari ( and other Yokohama photographers of his era , particularly Kusakabe and Tamamura ) is rightly undergoing re @-@ evaluation after many years in which it was dismissed as tourist kitsch and " perceived by some as pandering to nineteenth @-@ century Western notions of exoticism " . Farsari 's photographs and albums are included in numerous museums and private collections around the world , and a selection of his works was exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston in 2004 .

 = Subterranean Jungle = 
 Subterranean Jungle is the seventh studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones , released by Sire Records in February 1983 . The album appealed to a hardcore punk rock style rather than featuring several pop oriented pieces ; this is because guitarist Johnny Ramone received more leeway with steering the overall genre with his hard rock influenced riffs . The recording sessions saw disputes between band members , mainly because many of the band members were dealing with alcohol addiction , or in bassist Dee Dee Ramone 's case , cocaine . 
 The album begins with two cover songs , and features a third on Side 2 . Lyrics circle various themes , while the structuring of the songs shifted towards hard rock , psychedelic rock . The album was deemed by critics to be an attempt to retreat to the band 's roots and received mostly positive reviews . Subterranean Jungle was not very successful commercially , peaking at number 83 on the US Billboard 200 and failing to chart internationally . The singles released from the album did not chart either . This is the last album by the band to feature Marky Ramone on drums until the 1989 album Brain Drain . 
 = = Conception = = 
 Unlike previous albums , Subterranean Jungle shifted the band 's sound output focus towards getting back to their punk rock roots , rather than trying to expand fan @-@ base by releasing more pop @-@ oriented songs . This change is due to guitarist Johnny Ramone obtaining more priority over the style choice . Johnny felt as though the band needed to " be focused and stop worrying about getting played [ on the radio ] and just make a good record . " Since lead singer Joey Ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom , the album lacks the sense of pop @-@ influence which previous releases had contained and instead was shaped mostly by Johnny 's hard rock background . 
 Johnny obtained more control over the musical style because the band members experienced conflict amongst themselves , specifically rooted in each member — excluding Johnny — facing issues with addiction . Both Joey and drummer Marky Ramone were dealing with alcoholism , while bassist Dee Dee Ramone was severely addicted to cocaine and was undergoing psychotherapeutic treatment . Since the Ramones ' previous two releases had producers which proved disappointing to the members , they were skeptical of the upcoming producer ; this would be Ritchie Cordell , with whom they also had issues with . Marky relates : " I hated the production , I hated the producer . " 
 The artwork for Subterranean Jungle features an image of the band inside a subway car . The photograph was taken by George DuBose at the subway station on 57th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan . This cover concept was deemed by Dubose , who suggested that since the B Sixth Avenue Express train stopped at the empty station for about 20 minutes . In the photograph , Marky is featured peering out the subway window — Marky was positioned this way after Johnny asked DuBose to do so because " they were kicking him out of the band , but he didn 't know it yet . " Marky recalled that he " liked that shot , but [ he ] knew something was up . " 
 " I was lying on my bed , watching Kojak when Joey calls me and says , ' Mark , I feel bad about this , but , uh , you can 't be in the band anymore . ' I deserved it . Joey was okay about it , but the others , forget it . No one called me after that . If it was today , Joey would 've said , ' Why don 't we take off for a month and you get sober ? ' But I didn 't want to tell Joey or the band about my being in rehab , because I would 've been admitting my guilt . " 
 The internal conflicts during recording sessions would cause band members to fire Marky during the album 's recording , consequently substituting him with drummer Billy Rogers on " Time has Come Today . " Johnny recounts , " We were having trouble with Mark because his drinking problem was really bad . So we did " Time Has Come Today " with a different drummer , Billy Rogers , from Walter Lure 's band . " 
 = = Compositions and lyrics = = 
 The album opens with two cover songs ; the first , " Little Bit O ' Soul , " was originally written by John Carter and Ken Lewis and the second , " I Need Your Love , " was first performed by Bobby Dee Waxman . Subterranean Jungle is the first Ramones ' release to begin with a song not written by the band — this track list structure was criticized by author Everett True , who said that it was " disorientating . " Johnny also thought that the fact that the album featured three covers was a bad idea , saying , " we shouldn 't have , but I was happy with the guitar sound on it . " The album 's third track , " Outsider , " was written by Dee Dee and , in 2002 , it was covered by Green Day on Shenanigans . " What 'd Ya Do ? " was track number four , and was described by music journalist Chuck Eddy as " crudely metallic . " Eddy also deemed the next track , " Highest Trails Above , " as " AOR @-@ mystic . " " Somebody Like Me " was called a " full @-@ on rock anthem " by Everett True , who went on to say that the lyrics contained " no @-@ nonsense lines . " 
 Side B of the album begins with " Psycho Therapy , " which was written by both Johnny and Dee Dee ; the song has since grown into one of the most popular Ramones ' song . Dee Dee recalled : " I knew we needed a real ' Ramones song ' for the album , and I knew [ Johnny ] was depressed about how things were going . He needed that song to get excited about the band again . " The next track is another cover song , " Time Has Come Today , " which was originally recorded by the soul music group The Chambers Brothers . The Ramones ' version of the song featured a psychedelic rock influence , and was said by Eddy to have more of a " garage " feel to it , as compared to the original . " My @-@ My Kind of a Girl " was directed specifically toward the band 's female fandom . The lyrics were written by Joey about meeting a girl on 8th Street in Manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her . In Vanity Fair , the song was regarded as a " lingering affection for Phil Spector 's pop grandeur . " Dee Dee 's " Time Bomb , " which was track number eleven , was said by True to be " more ridiculous than frightening . " The album concludes with " Everytime I Eat Vegetables It Makes Me Think of You , " which was said by author Todd Anderson to be a " sing along . "

 Subterranean Jungle was released by Sire Records in February 1983 . In a contemporary review for The Village Voice , music journalist Robert Christgau wrote that despite containing two inferior pieces ( " Highest Trails Above " and " I Need Your Love " ) , the album is " more worthy of an audience than anything they 've done in the ' 80s . " Stereo Review magazine strongly recommended it to " headbangers of all ages " as " a textbook Ramones album " whose <unk> lyrics about mental illness and drug abuse " can actually be refreshing . " The album peaked at number 83 in on the Billboard 200 in the US , but failed to chart elsewhere . Neither of the album 's singles — " Psycho Therapy " and " Time Has Come Today " — charted . 
 In a retrospective review for AllMusic , author Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Subterranean Jungle the band 's " most enjoyable record since Rocket to Russia , " and said that the producers " steered the Ramones back toward the ' 60s pop infatuation that provided the foundation for their early records . " He ended his review by stating that it may not be defined as the " strictest sense " of punk rock ; however , he strongly suggested that the band had not sounded so " alive " since their earlier days . Douglas Wolk , writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , was less enthusiastic and called it an " attempt at radio @-@ friendly production , " with a series of cover songs that " almost recasts the group as an oldies act . " In a 2004 interview for New York magazine , Johnny Ramone graded the album a " B " and said that he was pleased with its guitar sound , despite the three cover songs , while remarking " I was watching the Brewers @-@ Cardinals World Series when we were recording it .

 Newcastle United Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Newcastle upon Tyne . Following the club 's most recent relegation from the top @-@ flight during the 2015 – 16 season , Newcastle returned to the Football League 's 2nd tier , the Championship for the 2016 – 17 campaign . The club was founded in 1892 by the merger of Newcastle East End and Newcastle West End , and has played at its current home ground , St James ' Park , ever since . The ground was developed into an all @-@ seater stadium in the mid @-@ 1990s and now has a capacity of 52 @,@ 405 . The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but two years of the competition 's history , and has never dropped below English football 's second tier since joining the Football League in 1893 . The club has been owned by Mike Ashley since 2007 , succeeding long term chairman and owner Sir John Hall . 
 They have won four League Championship titles , six FA Cups and a Charity Shield , as well as the 1969 Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup and the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup . Newcastle United has the ninth highest total of trophies won by an English club . The club 's most successful period was between 1904 and 1910 , when they won an FA Cup and three of their First Division titles . The club is the seventeenth richest club in the world in terms of annual revenue , generating € <unk> in 2015 . Historically , Newcastle 's highest placing was in 1999 when they were the fifth richest in the world , and second in England only behind Manchester United . The club were highly successful in the Premier League in the 1990s and early 2000s , but have been mostly struggling since the 2006 – 07 season , and were relegated in 2009 and 2016 . 
 They have a fierce local rivalry with Sunderland , and the two clubs have engaged in the Tyne – Wear derby since 1898 . The club 's traditional kit colours are black and white striped shirts , black shorts and black socks . Their traditional crest takes elements of the city coat of arms , which features two grey seahorses .

 The first record of football being played on Tyneside dates from 3 March 1877 at Elswick Rugby Club . Later that year , Newcastle 's first football club , Tyne Association , was formed . The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of Byker in November 1881 . This team was renamed Newcastle East End F.C. in October 1882 , to avoid confusion with the cricket club in Stanley , County Durham . Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later . In 1886 , Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton . In August 1882 , Newcastle West End F.C. formed from West End Cricket Club , and in May 1886 , the club moved into St James ' Park . The two clubs became rivals in the Northern League . In 1889 , Newcastle East End became a professional team , before becoming a limited company the following March . However , on the other hand , Newcastle West End were in serious financial trouble and approached East End with a view to a take over . Newcastle West End were eventually dissolved , and a number of their players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End , effectively merging the two clubs , with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James ' Park in May 1892 . 
 With only one senior club in the city for fans to support , development of the club was much more rapid . Despite being refused entry to the Football League 's First Division at the start of the 1892 – 93 season , they were invited to play in their new Second Division . However , with no big names playing in the Second Division , they turned down the offer and remained in the Northern League , stating " gates would not meet the heavy expenses incurred for travelling " . In a bid to start drawing larger crowds , Newcastle East End decided to adopt a new name in recognition of the merger . Suggested names included Newcastle F.C. , Newcastle Rangers , Newcastle City and City of Newcastle , but Newcastle United was decided upon on 9 December 1892 , to signify the unification of the two teams . The name change was accepted by the Football Association on 22 December , but the club was not legally constituted as Newcastle United Football Club Co . Ltd. until 6 September 1895 . At the start of the 1893 – 94 season , Newcastle United were once again refused entry to the First Division and so joined the Second Division , along with Liverpool and Woolwich Arsenal . They played their first competitive match in the division that September against Woolwich Arsenal , with a score of 2 – 2 . 
 Turnstile numbers were still low , and the incensed club published a statement stating , " The Newcastle public do not deserve to be catered for as far as professional football is concerned " . However , eventually figures picked up by 1895 – 96 , when 14 @,@ 000 fans watched the team play Bury . That season Frank Watt became secretary of the club , and he was instrumental in promotion to the First Division for the 1898 – 99 season . However , they lost their first game 4 – 2 at home to Wolves and finished their first season in thirteenth place . 
 In 1903 – 04 , the club built up a promising squad of players , and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade , the team known for their " artistic play , combining team @-@ work and quick , short passing " . Long after his retirement , Peter McWilliam , the team 's defender at the time , said " The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them , and further more , beat them at a trot . " Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s ; 1904 – 05 , 1906 – 07 and 1908 – 09 . In 1904 – 05 , they nearly did the double , losing to Aston Villa in the 1905 FA Cup Final . They were beaten again the following year by Everton in the 1906 FA Cup Final . They reached the final again in 1908 where they lost to Wolves . In 1908 the team suffered a record 9 – 1 home defeat to local rivals Sunderland in the league but still won that season 's league title . They finally won the FA Cup in 1910 when they beat Barnsley in the final . They lost again the following year in the final against Bradford City . 
 The team returned to the FA Cup final in 1924 , in the second final held at the then new Wembley Stadium . They defeated Aston Villa , winning the club 's second FA Cup . Three years later they won the First Division championship a fourth time in 1926 – 27 , with Hughie Gallacher , one of the most prolific goal scorers in the club 's history , captaining the team . Other key players in this period were Neil Harris , Stan Seymour and Frank Hudspeth . In 1930 , Newcastle United came close to relegation , and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for Chelsea , and at the same time Andy Cunningham became the club 's first team manager . In 1931 – 32 , the club won the FA Cup a third time . However , a couple of years later , at the end of the 1933 – 34 season , the team were relegated to the Second Division after 35 seasons in the top . Cunningham left as manager and Tom Mather took over . 
 The club found it difficult to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the 1937 – 38 season , when they were spared on goal averages . However , when World War II broke in 1939 , Newcastle had a chance to regroup , and in the War period , they brought in Jackie Milburn , Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell . They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the 1947 – 48 season . During the 1950s , Newcastle won the FA Cup trophy on three occasions within a five @-@ year period , beating Blackpool in 1951 , Arsenal in 1952 , and Manchester City in 1955 . However , after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960 – 61 season under the management of Charlie Mitten . Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey . Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964 – 65 season after winning the Second Division title . Under Harvey , the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967 – 68 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup Final , triumphing 6 – 2 over two legs against Hungary 's Újpest in the final . 
 = = = The 70s and 80s = = = 
 Harvey bought striker Malcolm Macdonald in the summer of 1971 , for a club record transfer fee of £ 180 @,@ 000 . He was an impressive goal scorer , who led United 's attack to Wembley in their 1974 FA Cup Final defeat at the hands of Liverpool . The club also had back to back triumphs in the Texaco Cup in 1974 and 1975 . Harvey left the club in 1975 , with Gordon Lee brought in to replace him . Lee took the team to the 1976 Football League Cup Final against Manchester City , but failed to bring the trophy back to Tyneside . However , he sold Macdonald to Arsenal at the end of the season , a decision of which Macdonald later said " I loved Newcastle , until Gordon Lee took over " . Lee left for Everton in 1977 , and was replaced by Richard Dinnis . 
 United dropped once again to the Second Division at the end of the 1977 – 78 season . Dinnis was replaced by Bill McGarry , and then he was replaced by Arthur Cox . Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division at the end of the 1983 – 84 season , with players such as Peter Beardsley , Chris Waddle , and ex @-@ England captain Kevin Keegan the fulcrum of the team . However , with a lack of funds , Cox left for Derby County and Keegan retired . With managers such as Jack Charlton and then Willie McFaul , Newcastle remained in the top @-@ flight , until key players such as Waddle , Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne were sold , and the team was relegated once more in 1989 . McFaul left the managerial post , and was replaced by Jim Smith . Smith left at the start of the 1991 – 92 season and the board appointed Osvaldo Ardiles his replacement . 
 = = = The 90s = = = 
 Sir John Hall became the club 's chairman in 1992 , and replaced Ardiles with Keegan , who managed to save the team from relegation to the Third Division . Keegan was given more money for players , and he brought in Rob Lee , Paul Bracewell and Barry Venison and the club won the then First Division Championship at the end of the 1992 – 93 season , earning promotion to the then new Premier League . At the end of the 1993 – 94 season , their first year back in the top flight they finished in third , their highest league finish since 1927 . The attacking philosophy of Keegan led to the team being labelled " The Entertainers " by Sky Sports . 
 Keegan took Newcastle to two consecutive runners @-@ up finishes in the league in 1995 – 96 and 1996 – 97 , coming very close to winning the title in the former season . This success was in part due to the talent of players like David Ginola , Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer , who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of £ 15 million . 
 Keegan left Newcastle in January 1997 and was replaced by Kenny Dalglish , however the club endured a largely unsuccessful season with a 13th @-@ place finish in the 1997 – 98 FA Premier League , failure to progress beyond the group stages of the 1997 – 98 UEFA Champions League despite beating Barcelona and group winners Dynamo Kiev at St James Park as well as coming from 2 – 0 down to draw 2 – 2 with Valery <unk> 's team in Ukraine and defeat in the 1998 FA Cup Final . Dalglish was replaced as manager early in the following season by Ruud Gullit . 
 The club once again finished thirteenth in the league and lost the 1999 FA Cup Final . Gullit fell into disagreements with the squad and chairman Freddy Shepherd , and quit the club four games into the 1999 – 2000 season with the team bottom of the table to be replaced by Bobby Robson . The club managed to reach an FA Cup Semi @-@ final and to stay in the Premier League . 
 = = = 2000s = = = 
 A title challenge emerged during the 2001 – 02 season , and Newcastle 's fourth @-@ place finish saw them qualify for the Champions League . The following season , Robson guided the team to another title challenge and finished third in the League , and the second group stage of the Champions League . Newcastle finished fifth in the league at the end of the 2003 – 04 season , and exited the Champions League in the qualifying rounds , but despite this Robson was sacked in August 2004 following a series of disagreements with the club . 
 Graeme Souness was brought in to manage by the start of the 2004 – 05 season . In the time he managed , he broke the club 's transfer record by signing Michael Owen , however he was sacked in February 2006 after a bad start to the 2005 – 06 season . Glenn Roeder took over , initially on a temporary basis , before being appointed full @-@ time manager at the end of the season . Shearer retired at the end of the 2005 – 06 season as the club 's all @-@ time record goal scorer , with a total of 206 goals . 
 = = = = Decline and relegation = = = = 
 Despite finishing the 2005 – 06 season in seventh , Roeder 's fortunes changed in the 2006 – 07 season , with a terrible injury run to the senior squad , and he left the club by mutual consent on 6 May 2007 . 
 Sam Allardyce was appointed Roeder 's replacement as manager on 15 May 2007 . On 7 June , Freddy Shepherd 's final shares in the club were sold to Mike Ashley and Shepherd was replaced as chairman by Chris Mort on 25 July . 
 Allardyce departed the club on in January 2008 by mutual consent after a bad start to the 2007 – 08 season , and Kevin Keegan was reappointed as Newcastle manager . Mort stepped down as chairman in June and was replaced by Derek Llambias , a long @-@ term associate of Ashley . Newcastle finished the 2007 – 08 season in twelfth place , but as the season drew to a close , Keegan publicly criticised the board , claiming they were not providing the team enough financial support . 
 In September 2008 Keegan resigned as manager , stating " It 's my opinion that a manager must have the right to manage and that clubs should not impose upon any manager any player that he does not want " . Former Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear was appointed as his replacement , but in February 2009 , due to his heart surgery , Alan Shearer was appointed interim manager in his absence . Under Shearer , the club were relegated to the Football League Championship at the end of the 2008 – 09 season , the first time the club had left the Premier League since joining it in 1993 . 
 Following their relegation , the club was put up for sale in June 2009 , with an asking price of £ 100 million . Chris Hughton was given the manager job on a caretaker basis before taking over full @-@ time on 27 October 2009 . On the same day , Ashley announced that the club was no longer for sale . 
 = = = 2010s = = = 
 Hughton led Newcastle to win the 2009 – 10 Football League Championship , securing automatic promotion on 5 April 2010 with five games remaining , and securing the title on 19 April ; Newcastle were promoted back to the Premier League after just one season away . 
 Under Hughton , Newcastle enjoyed a strong start to the 2010 – 11 season , but he was sacked on 6 December 2010 . The club 's board stated that they felt " an individual with more managerial experience [ was ] needed to take the club forward . " Three days later , Alan Pardew was appointed as manager with a five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year contract . Further controversy was caused on 31 January 2011 , when striker Andy Carroll was sold to Liverpool for a club record of £ 35 million . Despite this turbulence , Newcastle were able to finish 12th at the end of the season , with one particular highlight being a 4 – 4 home draw against Arsenal that saw Newcastle come back from four goals down to claim a point . 
 The start of the 2011 – 12 season saw an overhaul in the first team , with the sale of influential first team players Kevin Nolan , Joey Barton and José Enrique during the summer and the elevation of Tim Krul as first choice goalkeeper and centre back Fabricio <unk> as captain . <unk> such as Yohan Cabaye , Italian international Davide Santon and Senegalese striker Demba Ba in cut @-@ price deals saw <unk> adopt a new transfer policy , one which would be met with success in the season . They went on to enjoy one of their strongest openings to a season , playing 11 consecutive games <unk> before losing away to Manchester City . Another Senegalese striker , <unk> Cissé , joined in the January transfer window , and Newcastle had a strong second half of the season , eventually securing a place in the 2012 – 13 Europa League . Newcastle finished in fifth place , their highest league position since the Bobby Robson days . Further honours were to come as Pardew won both the Premier League Manager of the Season and the LMA Manager of the Year awards , captain <unk> was named in the PFA Team of the Year , and Cissé won the Goal of the Season award for a goal against Chelsea . 
 The 2012 – 13 season saw Newcastle regain European football for the first time since 2007 . Newcastle made few acquisitions in the summer and suffered injuries over the season , including layoffs to key midfielders Yohan Cabaye and Hatem Ben Arfa , and defenders Steven and Ryan Taylor . As a result , the first half of the season was marred by a run of ten losses in 13 games , which saw the club sink near the relegation zone . In January , Newcastle signed five French players , and advanced to the Europa League quarter @-@ finals before bowing out to eventual finalists Benfica . Domestically , Newcastle struggled , and stayed up after a 2 – 1 victory over already @-@ relegated Queens Park Rangers on the penultimate game of the season . 
 The 2014 – 15 season saw Newcastle fail to win any of their first seven games , prompting fans to start a campaign to get Pardew sacked as manager before a six @-@ game winning run in all competitions ( including knocking holders Manchester City out of the Capital One Cup ) saw them climb to fifth in the table . After they ended Chelsea 's unbeaten start to the season , Pardew left for Crystal Palace . On 26 January 2015 , his assistant John Carver was put in charge for the remainder of the season but came close to relegation , staying up on the final day with a 2 – 0 home win against West Ham , with Jonás Gutiérrez , who beat testicular cancer earlier in the season , scoring the team 's second goal . 
 On 9 June 2015 , Carver and his assistant Steve Stone were both sacked and replaced by Steve McClaren the following day . McClaren subsequently signed <unk> <unk> for £ 14 @.@ 5 million from PSV Eindhoven along with both Aleksandar Mitrović and Chancel <unk> from Belgian club Anderlecht for £ 13 million and £ 8 million , respectively . Newcastle failed to win any of their first eight Premier League games of the 2015 – 16 season , a run which included a 0 – 1 home defeat against Sheffield Wednesday in the third round of the League Cup . In January 2016 , the club signed midfielders Jonjo Shelvey and Andros Townsend for a combined total of £ 24 million as well as midfielder Henri <unk> . However , the club continued to struggle and a 1 – 3 defeat to Bournemouth on 5 March left Newcastle with its lowest points total after 28 games in its Premier League history . On 11 March McClaren was sacked after nine months as manager , with Newcastle in 19th place in the Premier League and the club winning six of 28 Premier League games during his time at the club . He was replaced by Rafael Benítez on the same day , who signed a three @-@ year deal , but was not able to prevent the club from being relegated . 
 = = Colours and badge = = 
 The club 's home colours are a black and white striped shirt . Shorts and socks are usually black with white trim , though white socks are sometimes worn under some managers who consider them " lucky " . Newcastle 's colours at the outset was generally the home kit of Newcastle East End F.C. , comprising plain red shirts with white shorts and red socks . In 1894 , the club adopted the black and white striped shirts , which had been used as the reserve team 's colours . These colours were chosen for the senior team because they were not associated with either of the two teams United were merged from . They played in grey shorts until 1897 , and between 1897 and 1921 , they played in blue shorts before adopting the black shorts they play in now . 
 United 's away colours have changed a number of times over the years . They played in white shirts and black shorts from 1914 until 1961 , and then white shorts until 1966 . They then played in yellow shirts and blue shorts for the 1967 – 68 season , but from 1969 to 1974 played in all red with an all blue third kit . In 1974 , they returned to a yellow shirt , which they played with various coloured shorts until 1983 . They played in all grey from 1983 to 1988 , before once again returning to the yellow kit until 1993 . Since 1995 , the away kit has changed consistently and has not been the same for more than a single season . The club 's shirt sponsor has been Newcastle based bank Northern Rock since 2003 , but prior to this , they had been sponsored at different times by <unk> : Telewest , Newcastle Brown Ale and Greenall 's . Through owner Mike Ashley , the club also has a relationship with the Sports Direct retail chain which he founded . 
 On 4 January 2012 , Virgin Money , who had just bought Northern Rock , signed a two @-@ year deal to sponsor Newcastle United . In January 2010 , Puma became the official supplier and licensee of replica merchandise for Newcastle . The deal meant Puma supplied the team kit , replica kit and training equipment for the 2010 – 11 and 2011 – 12 seasons . 
 The current club crest was first used in the 1988 – 89 season . The crest includes elements from the coat of arms of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne — the two sea horses representing Tyneside 's strong connections with the sea , the castle representing the city 's Norman keep . The city 's coat of arms were first embroidered on the team 's shirts in 1969 and worn as standard until 1976 . A scroll at the bottom featured the city 's motto in Latin ; <unk> <unk> <unk> which translates into English as " triumphing by brave defence . " From 1976 until 1983 , the club wore a specific badge which was developed to wear in place of the city 's coat of arms . The design was of a circular shape , which featured the club 's name in full , it contained a magpie standing in front of the River Tyne with the historic Norman castle of Newcastle in the background . A more simplistic design followed in 1983 , featuring the initials of the club 's name , <unk> with the small magpie used in the previous crest within the horizontally laid " C , " this logo was relatively short lived and was discontinued after 1988 . 
 On 16 May 2013 , Newcastle released the away shirt for the 2013 – 14 season which for the first time features the <unk> logo , which has attracted criticism from many Newcastle supporters ; the shirt is navy blue with light blue bands . The shirt received mixed reviews from Newcastle supporters , who described the shirt as both " awesome " and " bland , " as quoted in the Newcastle daily Evening Chronicle . In July 2013 , Newcastle striker and practicing Muslim <unk> Cissé refused to wear any official kit or training wear with reference to <unk> , subsequently failing to travel to the team 's 2013 pre @-@ season tour of Portugal . The matter has since been resolved . Previous kit sponsors include Newcastle Breweries ( 1980 – 86 ) , Greenall 's Beers ( 1986 – 90 ) , McEwan 's Lager and Newcastle Brown Ale ( 1990 – 2000 ) , NTL ( 2000 – 03 ) , Northern Rock ( 2003 – 12 ) , and Virgin Money ( 2012 – 13 ) 
 Newcastle 's current kit manufacturers are Puma , in a deal that started in 2010 . Previous kit manufacturers include Bukta ( 1974 – 75 , 1976 – 80 ) , Umbro ( 1975 – 76 , 1980 – 86 ) , Asics ( 1993 – 95 ) and Adidas ( 1995 – 2010 ) .
