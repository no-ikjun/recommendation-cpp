 = Kuala Lumpur = 
 Kuala Lumpur ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; Malaysian pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , officially the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur , is the national capital and most populous global city of Malaysia . The city covers an area of 243 km2 ( 94 sq mi ) and has an estimated population of 1 @.@ 7 million as of 2015 . Greater Kuala Lumpur , covering similar area as the Klang Valley , is an urban agglomeration of 7 @.@ 2 million people as of 2013 . It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in South @-@ East Asia , in terms of population and economy . 
 Kuala Lumpur is the seat of the Parliament of Malaysia . The city was once home to the executive and judicial branches of the federal government , but they were moved to Putrajaya in early 1999 . Some sections of the judiciary still remain in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur . The official residence of the Malaysian King , the Istana Negara , is also situated in Kuala Lumpur . Rated as an alpha world city , Kuala Lumpur is the cultural , financial and economic centre of Malaysia due to its position as the capital as well as being a key city . 
 Kuala Lumpur is one of three Federal Territories of Malaysia , <unk> within the state of Selangor , on the central west coast of Peninsular Malaysia . Since the 1990s , the city has played host to many international sporting , political and cultural events including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the Formula One Grand Prix . In addition , Kuala Lumpur is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world , the Petronas Twin Towers , which have become an iconic symbol of Malaysia 's futuristic development . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 Kuala Lumpur means " muddy confluence " ; <unk> is the point where two rivers join together or an estuary , and <unk> means " mud " . One suggestion is that it is named after Sungai Lumpur ( River Lumpur ) ; it was recorded in 1824 that Sungei <unk> was the most important tin @-@ producing settlement up the Klang River . Doubts however have been raised on such a derivation as Kuala Lumpur lies at the confluence of Gombak River and Klang River , therefore should rightly be named Kuala Gombak . It has been argued by some that Sungai Lumpur is in fact Gombak River ( therefore the point where it joined the Klang River would be Kuala Lumpur ) , although Sungai Lumpur has also been suggested to be another river a mile upstream from the Gombak confluence . 
 It has been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named <unk> Lumpur ( a muddy landing place ) , while others suggest it was a corrupted Cantonese word lam @-@ pa meaning ' flooded jungle ' or ' decayed jungle ' . There is however no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes . It is also possible that the name is a corrupted form of an earlier but now unidentifiable forgotten name . 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 It is unknown who founded or named the settlement called Kuala Lumpur . Chinese miners were involved in tin mining up the Selangor River in the 1840s about ten miles north of present @-@ day Kuala Lumpur , and Mandailing Sumatrans led by Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa were also involved in tin mining and trade in the Ulu Klang region before 1860 , and Sumatrans may have settled in the upper reaches of Klang River in the first quarter of the 19th century , possibly earlier . Kuala Lumpur was originally a small hamlet of just a few houses and shops at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang ( Klang River ) before it grew into a town . It is generally accepted that Kuala Lumpur become established as a town circa 1857 , when the Malay Chief of Klang , Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar , aided by his brother Raja Juma 'at of Lukut , raised funds to hire some Chinese miners from Lukut to open new tin mines here . The miners landed at Kuala Lumpur and continued their journey on foot to Ampang where the first mine was opened . Kuala Lumpur was the furthest point up the Klang River to which supplies could conveniently be brought by boat ; it therefore became a collection and dispersal point serving the tin mines . 
 Although the early miners suffered a high death toll due to the malarial conditions of the jungle , the Ampang mines were successful , and the first tin was exported in 1859 . The tin @-@ mining spurred the growth of the town , and miners later also settled in Pudu and Batu . The miners formed gangs among themselves ; there were the Hakka @-@ dominated Hai San in Kuala Lumpur , and the Cantonese @-@ dominated Ghee Hin based in <unk> in Ulu Selangor . Fights between different gangs were frequent in this period , mainly to gain control of the best tin mines . Leaders of the Chinese community were conferred the title of Kapitan Cina ( Chinese headman ) by the Malay chief , and Hiu Siew , the owner of a mine in Lukut , was chosen as the first Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur . As one of the first traders to arrive in Ampang ( along with Yap Ah Sze ) , he sold provisions to the miners in exchange for tin . 
 Important Malay figures of early Kuala <unk> also include Dato ' Dagang and Haji Tahir . The Minangkabaus were another important group of people in the early period ; Minangkabau traders from Sumatra include <unk> Abdullah , and Haji Mohamed Taib who was involved in the early development of Kampung Baru . The Minangkabaus are also important socio @-@ religious figures , for example <unk> bin Abdullah was the first <unk> of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail . 
 = = = Beginning of modern Kuala Lumpur = = = 
 Early Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems – the buildings were made of wood and atap ( palm frond thatching ) that were prone to fire , lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases , and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding . The town became embroil in the Selangor Civil War due in part to the fight for control of revenues from the tin mines . The third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur appointed in 1868 , Yap Ah Loy , aligned himself with Tengku <unk> , and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi . Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground , and Yap escaped to Klang . Kuala Lumpur was recaptured in March 1873 when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang . The war and other setbacks , such as a drop in tin prices , led to a slump , furthermore a major outbreak of cholera in late 1870s caused many to flee the town . The slump lasted until late 1879 , when a rise in the price of tin allowed the town to recover . In late 1881 , the town was severely flooded , following a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January that year . That the town was rebuilt a few times and thrived was due in large part to the tenacity and persistence of Yap Ah Loy . Yap , together with Frank Swettenham who was appointed the Resident in 1882 , were the two most important figures of early Kuala Lumpur with Swettenham credited with its rapid growth and development and its transformation into a major urban center . 
 The early Chinese and Malay settlements were along the east bank of the Klang River – the Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square ; the Malays , later Indian <unk> and Indian Muslims resided along Java Street ( now Jalan Tun Perak ) . In 1880 , the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration , and the British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas then decided that the government buildings and living quarters should be located to the west of the river . Government offices and a new police headquarter was built on Bukit Aman , and the Padang was created initially for police training . The Padang , now known as Merdeka Square , would later become the centre of the British administrative offices when the colonial government offices were moved to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1897 . 
 Frank Swettenham , on becoming the British Resident , began improving the town by cleaning up the streets . He also stipulated that buildings should be constructed of brick and tile so that they would be less flammable , and that the town be rebuilt with wider streets to reduce fire risk . Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry for the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur ; this place is the eponymous Brickfields . Destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones , and many of the new brick buildings are characterised by the " five foot ways " as well as Chinese carpentry work . This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region . Kapitan Yap Ah Loy expanded road access in the city significantly , linking up tin mines with the city ; these roads include the main arterial routes of the present Ampang Road , Pudu Road and Petaling Street . As Chinese Kapitan , he was vested with wide powers on a par with Malay community leaders . Law reforms were implemented and new legal measures introduced to the assembly . Yap also presided over a small claims court . With a police force of six , he was able to uphold the rule of law , constructing a prison that could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time . Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur 's first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor 's Sultan Abdul Samad held an interest . 
 A railway line between Kuala Lumpur and Klang , initiated by Swettenham and completed in 1886 , increased accessibility which resulted in the rapid growth of the town . The population grew from 4 @,@ 500 in 1884 to 20 @,@ 000 in 1890 . As development intensified in the 1880s , it also put pressure on sanitation , waste disposal and other health issues . A Sanitary Board was created on 14 May 1890 which was responsible for sanitation , upkeep of roads , lighting of street and other functions . This would eventually become the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council . In 1896 , Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States . 
 = = = 20th century – present = = = 
 The area that is defined as Kuala Lumpur expanded considerably in the 20th century . It was only 0 @.@ 65 km2 in 1895 , but was extended to encompass 20 km2 in 1903 . By the time it became a municipality in 1948 it had expanded to 93 km2 , and then to 243 km2 in 1974 as a Federal Territory . 
 The development of the rubber industry in Selangor in the early 20th century led to a boom of the town , with the population of Kuala Lumpur increasing from 30 @,@ 000 in 1900 to 80 @,@ 000 in 1920 . Previously the commercial activities of Kuala Lumpur were primarily run by Chinese businessmen such as Loke Yew who was then the richest and most influential Chinese of Kuala Lumpur . The growth of the rubber industry led to an influx of foreign capital and planters , with new companies and industries becoming established in Kuala Lumpur , and other companies previously based in Singapore and elsewhere also found a presence here . 
 During World War II , Kuala Lumpur was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942 . They occupied the city until 15 August 1945 , when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia , Seishirō Itagaki , surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Kuala Lumpur grew through the war , the rubber and tin commodity crashes and the Malayan Emergency , during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency . In 1957 , the Federation of Malaya gained its independence from British rule . The ceremony for the Declaration of Independence was held at the Merdeka Stadium by the first Prime Minister of Malaya , Tunku Abdul Rahman . Kuala Lumpur remained the capital after the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 . The Malaysian Houses of Parliament was completed at the edge of the Lake Gardens in 1963 . 
 On 13 May 1969 , the worst race riots on record in Malaysia took place in Kuala Lumpur . The so @-@ called 13 May Incident refers to the occurrence of violence between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities . The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio @-@ political status . The riots caused the deaths of 196 people , and led to major changes in the country 's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities . 
 Kuala Lumpur achieved city status in 1972 , becoming the first settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence . Later , on 1 February 1974 , Kuala Lumpur became a Federal Territory . Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital . On 14 May 1990 , Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council . The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced . On 1 February 2001 , Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory , as well as the seat of the federal government . The administrative and judicial functions of the government were shifted from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya . Kuala Lumpur however still retained its legislative function , and remained the home of the Yang di @-@ Pertuan Agong ( Constitutional King ) . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The geography of Kuala Lumpur is characterised by the huge Klang Valley . The valley is bordered by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east , several minor ranges in the north and the south and the Strait of Malacca in the west . Kuala Lumpur is a Malay term that translates to " muddy confluence " as it is located at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers . 
 Located in the centre of Selangor state , Kuala Lumpur was previously under the rule of Selangor State Government . In 1974 , Kuala Lumpur was separated from Selangor to form the first Federal Territory governed directly by the Malaysian Federal Government . Its location on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia , which has wider flat land than the east coast , has contributed to its faster development relative to other cities in Malaysia . The municipality of the city covers an area of 243 km2 ( 94 sq mi ) , with an average elevation of 81 @.@ 95 m ( 268 @.@ 9 ft ) . 
 = = = Climate and weather = = = 
 Protected by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east and Indonesia 's Sumatra Island in the west , Kuala Lumpur has a tropical rainforest climate ( Köppen climate classification Af ) , which is warm and sunny , along with abundant rainfall , especially during the northeast monsoon season from October to March . Temperatures tend to remain constant . <unk> hover between 32 and 33 ° C ( 90 and 91 ° F ) and have never exceeded 38 @.@ 5 ° C ( 101 @.@ 3 ° F ) , while minimums hover between 23 @.@ 4 and 24 @.@ 6 ° C ( 74 @.@ 1 and 76 @.@ 3 ° F ) and have never fallen below 14 @.@ 4 ° C ( 57 @.@ 9 ° F ) . Kuala Lumpur typically receives minimum 2 @,@ 600 mm ( 100 in ) of rain annually ; June and July are relatively dry , but even then rainfall typically exceeds 131 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) per month . 
 Flooding is a frequent occurrence in Kuala Lumpur whenever there is a heavy downpour , especially in the city centre and downstream areas . Smoke from forest fires of nearby Sumatra sometimes cast a haze over the region . It is a major source of pollution in the city together with open burning , emission from motor vehicles and construction work . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Kuala Lumpur was administered by a corporation sole called the Federal Capital Commissioner from 1 April 1961 , until it was awarded city status in 1972 , after which executive power transferred to the Lord Mayor ( Datuk Bandar ) . Nine mayors have been appointed since then . The current mayor is <unk> Amin Nordin Abdul Aziz , who has been in office since 18 July 2015 .

Executive power lies with the mayor in the city hall , who is appointed for three years by the Federal Territories Minister . This system of appointing the mayor has been in place ever since the local government elections were suspended in 1970 .

 = = Economy = = 
 Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding urban areas form the most industrialised and economically , the fastest growing region in Malaysia .

 The city remains as the economic and business centre of the country . Kuala Lumpur is a centre for finance , insurance , real estate , media and the arts of Malaysia . Kuala Lumpur is rated as an alpha world city , and is the only global city in Malaysia , according to the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network ( GaWC ) . The infrastructure development in the surrounding areas such as the Kuala Lumpur International Airport at Sepang , the creation of the Multimedia Super Corridor and the expansion of Port Klang further reinforce the economic significance of the city . 
 Bursa Malaysia or the Malaysia Exchange is based in the city and forms one of its core economic activities . As of 5 July 2013 , the market capitalisation stood at US $ 505 @.@ 67 billion . 
 The Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for Kuala Lumpur is estimated at <unk> million in 2008 with an average annual growth rate of 5 @.@ 9 percent .

 The large service sector is evident in the number of local and foreign banks and insurance companies operating in the city . Kuala Lumpur is poised to become the global Islamic Financing hub with an increasing number of financial institutions providing Islamic Financing and the strong presence of Gulf 's financial institutions such as the world 's largest Islamic bank , Al @-@ <unk> Bank and Kuwait Finance House . Apart from that , the Dow Jones & Company is keen to work with Bursa Malaysia to set up Islamic Exchange Trade Funds ( <unk> ) , which would help raise Malaysia 's profile in the Gulf . The city has a large number of foreign corporations and is also host to many multi national companies ' regional offices or support centres , particularly for finance and accounting , and information technology functions . Most of the countries ' largest companies have their headquarters based here and as of December 2007 and excluding Petronas , there are 14 companies that are listed in Forbes 2000 based in Kuala Lumpur . 
 Other important economic activities in the city are education and health services . Kuala Lumpur also has advantages stemming from the high concentration of educational institutions that provide a wide @-@ ranging of courses . Numerous public and private medical specialist centres and hospitals in the city offer general health services , and a wide range of specialist surgery and treatment that caters to locals and tourists . 
 There has been growing emphasis to expand the economic scope of the city into other service activities , such as research and development , which supports the rest of the economy of Malaysia .

 = = Demographics = = 
 Kuala Lumpur is the most populous city in Malaysia , with a population of 1 @.@ 7 million in the city proper as of 2015 . It has a population density of 6 @,@ 696 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 17 @,@ 340 / sq mi ) , and is the most densely populated administrative district in Malaysia . Residents of the city are colloquially known as <unk> . Kuala Lumpur is also the centre of the wider Klang Valley conurbation ( covering Petaling Jaya , Klang , Subang Jaya , Shah Alam , Gombak and others ) which has an estimated metropolitan population of 7 @.@ 2 million as of 2012 . 
 Kuala Lumpur 's heterogeneous populace includes the country 's three major ethnic groups : the Malays , the Chinese and the Indians , although the city also has a mix of different cultures including Eurasians , as well as Kadazans , Ibans and other indigenous races from East Malaysia and Peninsula Malaysia . 
 Historically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city , with the Kuala Lumpur of 1872 ( before its destruction in the Selangor Civil War ) beside the Klang River described by Frank Swettenham as a " purely Chinese village " , although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time . By 1875 Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn . More recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group . Large number of Malays now considered Bumiputra were originally from the Indonesian archipelago – the Minangkabaus , Javanese , and Buginese began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century , while the Acehnese arrived in the late 20th century . Some Pahang Malays who fought in the Selangor Civil War in 1873 also chose to settle in Kuala Lumpur after the war . The population of Kuala Lumpur was estimated to be around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor . In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase , due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and Klang . 
 A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43 @,@ 796 inhabitants , 79 % of whom were Chinese ( 71 % of the Chinese were Hakka ) , 14 % Malay , and 6 % Indian . Another estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20 @,@ 000 . In 1931 , 61 % of Kuala Lumpur 's 111 @,@ 418 inhabitants were Chinese , and in 1947 63 @.@ 5 % . The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers , in part due to government employment , as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived . Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled , increasing from 12 @.@ 5 to 15 % , while the proportion of Chinese dropped . The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service , and later the implementation of the New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business . In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million , with 52 % Chinese , 33 % Malay , and 15 % Indian . From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77 % , but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43 % compared to Bumiputras at 38 % . By the 2010 census , according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non @-@ citizens , the percentage of the Bumiputera population in Kuala Lumpur has reached around 45 @.@ 9 % , with the Chinese population at 43 @.@ 2 % and Indians 10 @.@ 3 % . 
 A notable phenomenon in recent times has been the increase of foreign residents in Kuala Lumpur , which rose from 1 % of the city 's population in 1980 to about 8 % in the 2000 census , and 9 @.@ 4 % in the 2010 census . These figures also do not include a significant number of illegal immigrants . Kuala Lumpur 's rapid development has triggered a huge influx of low @-@ skilled foreign workers from Indonesia , Nepal , Burma , Thailand , Bangladesh , India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Philippines , and Vietnam into Malaysia , many of whom enter the country illegally or without proper permits . 
 Birth rates in Kuala Lumpur have declined and resulted in the lower proportion of young people – the proportion of those in the below 15 years old category fell from 33 % in 1980 to slightly less than 27 % in 2000 . On the other hand , the working age group of 15 – 59 increased from 63 % in 1980 to 67 % in 2000 . The elderly age group , 60 years old and above has increased from 4 % in 1980 and 1991 to 6 % in 2000 . 
 Kuala Lumpur is pluralistic and religiously diverse . The city has many places of worship catering to the multi @-@ religious population . Islam is practised primarily by the Malays and the Indian Muslim communities . Buddhism , Confucianism and Taoism are practised mainly among the Chinese . Indians traditionally adhere to Hinduism . Some Chinese and Indians also subscribe to Christianity . 
 As of 2010 Census the population of Kuala Lumpur is 46 @.@ 4 % Muslim , 35 @.@ 7 % Buddhist , 8 @.@ 5 % Hindu , 5 @.@ 8 % Christian , 1 @.@ 1 % Taoist or Chinese religion adherent , 2 @.@ 0 % follower of other religions , and 0 @.@ 5 % non @-@ religious . 
 Bahasa Malaysia is the principal language in Kuala Lumpur . Kuala Lumpur residents are generally literate in English , with a large proportion adopting it as their first language . It has a strong presence , especially in business and is a compulsory language taught in schools . Cantonese and Mandarin are prominent as they are spoken by the local majority Chinese population . Another major dialect spoken is Hakka . While Tamil is dominant amongst the local Indian population , other Indian languages spoken include Telugu , Malayalam , Punjabi and Hindi . Beside the Malay language , there are a variety of languages spoken by people of Indonesian descent , such as Minangkabau and Javanese .

 The architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a mixture of old colonial influences , Asian traditions , Malay Islamic inspirations , modern , and postmodern architecture mix . Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok , Jakarta and Manila , most of Kuala Lumpur 's colonial buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries . These buildings have Mughal / Moorish Revival , Tudor , Neo @-@ Gothic or Grecian @-@ Spanish style or architecture . Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate , which is hot and humid all year around 
 Prior to the Second World War , many shophouses , usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs , were built around the old city centre . These shop @-@ houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions . Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar ( Old Market Square ) , Chinatown , Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman , Jalan <unk> , Bukit Bintang and <unk> Tong Shin areas . 
 Independence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country , has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city . Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris . Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building , signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings . Examples of these buildings are Menara Telekom , Menara Maybank , <unk> Complex , and the Islamic Centre . Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship , complete with dome and minaret , when in fact it is a place of science and knowledge . The 452 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 483 ft ) tall Petronas Twin Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world . They were designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art . 
 Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late @-@ 1990s and early @-@ 2000s . With the economic development , old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones . Buildings with all @-@ glass shells exist throughout the city , with the most prominent examples being the Petronas Twin Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre . Kuala Lumpur 's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre ( KLCC ) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline . According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat , Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 metres with a combined height of 34 @,@ 035 metres from its 244 high rise buildings .

 = André Morell = 
 André Morell ( born Cecil André Mesritz , 20 August 1909 – 28 November 1978 ) was an English actor . He appeared frequently in theatre , film and on television from the 1930s to the 1970s . His best known screen roles were as Professor Bernard Quatermass in the BBC Television serial Quatermass and the Pit ( 1958 – 59 ) , and as Doctor Watson in the Hammer Film Productions version of The Hound of the Baskervilles ( 1959 ) . He also appeared in the films The Bridge on the River Kwai ( 1957 ) and Ben @-@ Hur ( 1959 ) , in several of Hammer 's horror films throughout the 1960s and in the acclaimed ITV historical drama The Caesars ( 1968 ) . 
 His obituary in The Times newspaper described him as possessing a " commanding presence with a rich , responsive voice … whether in the classical or modern theatre he was authoritative and dependable . "

 = = = Early life and career = = = 
 Morell was born Cecil André Mesritz in London , England , the son of André and Rosa Mesritz . Prior to taking up acting professionally he trained as a motor engineer , while also participating in amateur theatrical productions . He turned professional in 1934 , initially acting under the name André Mesritz ; he anglicised this to André Morell in 1936 , and adopted the latter name legally by deed poll in 1938 . 
 In 1938 he joined the Old Vic theatre company , and appeared in several of their high @-@ profile productions both at their home theatre and on tour throughout Britain and across the rest of the world . He appeared in Hamlet as Horatio opposite Alec Guinness in the title role , and as Alonso in John Gielgud 's production of The Tempest . He played Mercutio in a production of Romeo and Juliet mounted by the Old Vic company at Streatham in 1939 , with Robert Donat as Romeo . This was Morell 's favourite role from his career . His performance in the play was praised by The Times 's critic as " a neat and carefully studied portrait ; he is admirable in all his cynical and humorous passages " , although the reviewer did add that " one could wish that he had left this manner for the speech about Queen Mab and addressed this , as a piece of direct poetry , directly to the audience . " 
 Towards the end of the 1930s he began appearing in films , making his debut on the big screen in 13 Men and a Gun ( 1938 ) . He appeared frequently in several early drama productions on the BBC 's fledgling television service , featuring in such roles as Mr Wickham in Pride and Prejudice ( 1938 ) and Le Bret in Cyrano de Bergerac ( 1938 ) . The onset of World War II interrupted his acting career , and he joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1940 . He served with the regiment until 1946 , by which time he had attained the rank of major . 
 = = = Major film and television roles = = = 
 Morell returned to the theatre after the war , including another period at the Old Vic in the 1951 – 52 season . The New Statesman 's critic T. C. Worsley wrote of his performance in a star @-@ studded revival of King Lear that " Mr Morell 's Kent is the best I remember since Sir Ralph Richardson 's . " Of his performance in the title role in Tyrone Guthrie 's production of Timon of Athens , the Daily Mail wrote : " From his stage and screen performances we know him already as an eminently dependable actor , but last night he became a spectacular actor . " 
 The same profile quoted Morell 's catholic approach to stage assignments : " If a part is a good part and I feel I can enjoy playing it , it doesn 't matter whether it 's Shakespeare or modern farce … I 'd hate to be bogged down in Shakespeare or classic theatre all my life . It 's a good thing for an actor to do many different kinds of theatre , because it keeps his imagination stimulated . " 
 However , he now increasingly began to win leading parts on television , and in 1953 was cast by the television director Rudolph Cartier in a play called It Is Midnight , Dr Schweitzer . Cartier was impressed with Morell 's performance in this play , and offered him the leading role in a science @-@ fiction serial he was preparing with the writer Nigel Kneale , entitled The Quatermass Experiment . Morell considered the not @-@ yet @-@ completed script , but decided to decline the offer ; the part went instead to his co @-@ star from It Is Midnight , Dr Schweitzer , Reginald Tate . 
 He did take one of the leading parts in another Cartier and Kneale production the following year , when he played O 'Brien in their version of George Orwell 's novel Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four , opposite Peter Cushing as Winston Smith . This was a successful and controversial production which provoked much comment and debate ; Morell 's part in it has been praised for his " coolly menacing performance [ that ] is at least equal to Cushing 's . " 
 This successful collaboration with Cartier and Kneale resulted , four years later , in him once again being offered the role of Professor Bernard Quatermass for the pair 's third serial in the series , Quatermass and the Pit , although on this occasion another actor – Alec Clunes – had already turned them down . This time Morell accepted the part , and is regarded by several critics as having provided the definitive interpretation of the character . Morell personally found that in later years it was the role for which he was most often remembered by members of the public . 
 As well as these and other television appearances , Morell gained several notable film roles towards the end of the 1950s . He appeared in two films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture ; The Bridge on the River Kwai ( 1957 ) , as Colonel Green , and Ben @-@ Hur ( 1959 ) as Sextus . With Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes , he played Arthur Conan Doyle 's character Doctor John H. Watson , in Hammer Film Productions ' version of The Hound of the Baskervilles ( also 1959 ) . Morell was particularly keen that his portrayal of Watson should be closer to that originally depicted in Conan Doyle 's stories , and away from the bumbling stereotype established by Nigel Bruce 's interpretation of the role . An earlier Hammer film in which Morell appeared was The Camp on Blood Island ( 1957 ) . 
 In 1960 , Morell appeared as Judge Brack in a production of Henrik Ibsen 's play Hedda Gabler at the Oxford Playhouse . Starring opposite him in the title role was the film actress Joan Greenwood . They fell in love and flew in secret to Jamaica , where they were married , remaining together until his death .

 Morell continued to appear in Hammer 's horror films in the ensuing decade . He had parts in the Shadow of the Cat ( 1960 ) , She ( 1964 , again with Peter Cushing ) and its sequel Vengeance of She ( 1967 ) , the lead in The Plague of the Zombies ( 1965 ) , and The Mummy 's Shroud ( 1966 ) . He also starred with Cushing in Hammer 's Cash on Demand , playing the same role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play , The Gold Inside . He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer 's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit ( 1967 ) . He did not wish to repeat himself . 
 Morell continued to act successfully on television throughout the decade , with guest roles in episodes of series such as The Avengers ( 1963 and 1965 ) , Danger Man ( 1965 ) , Doctor Who ( " The Massacre of St Bartholomew 's Eve " 1966 ) , The Saint ( 1965 ) and in The Caesars ( 1968 ) in a prominent role as the Roman emperor Tiberius . 
 In 1969 , he became the vice president of Equity , the trade union for British actors and performers . He then served as president of the organisation for a year from 1973 – 74 . During this time he was involved in a dispute in which Equity threatened to expel Laurence Olivier as a member due to comments he made in a newspaper feature about the possibility of forming a breakaway union . The union also suffered from financial problems , and Morell continued to warn against destructive divisions amongst the members when he stepped down as president . 
 Despite his involvement in union business he continued to be a busy working actor . He appeared in Stanley Kubrick 's Barry Lyndon ( 1975 ) as a nobleman friend of the title character . His last television work was an episode of the ITV series The Professionals in 1978 , the year of his death . The animated film version of The Lord of the Rings , in which he voiced the character of Elrond , was released the same year , but his final film work was not seen until the year after his death . This was as the judge in The First Great Train Robbery . 
 Morell , who smoked up to 60 cigarettes a day until he gave up in 1976 , died from lung cancer in London on 28 November 1978 , at the age of 69 . He was survived by his wife Joan Greenwood and their son Jason . Jason Morell also became an actor , appearing in films such as Mrs. Brown ( 1997 , as Lord Stanley ) and Wilde ( also 1997 , as Ernest Dowson ) .

 = Adult animation = 
 Adult animation ( also known as adult cartoon ) is a genre of animation geared towards adults and sometimes teens . Works in this genre may be considered adult for any number of reasons . They may be noted for using risqué themes , graphic violence , explicit language , sexuality , or dark humor . Works in this genre may explore philosophical , political , or social issues . Some productions are noted for sophisticated and / or experimental storytelling and animation techniques . 
 Before the enforcement of the Hays Code , some cartoon shorts contained humor that was aimed at adult audience members rather than children . Following the introduction of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system , independent animation producers attempted to establish an alternative to mainstream animation . Initially , few animation studios in the United States attempted to produce animation for adult audiences , but later examples of animation produced for adults would gain mainstream attention and success . The most successful animated features produced in the United States primarily for adult audiences were directed by Ralph Bakshi , including Fritz the Cat , Heavy Traffic and Coonskin . 
 Fox Broadcasting Company has also dedicated an entire evening programming block to adult animation programs , known as " Animation Domination . " In Canada , Teletoon offers up its own Teletoon at Night programming block .

The earliest known instance of censorship in animation occurred when the censorship board of Pennsylvania requested that references to bootlegging be removed from Walt Disney 's 1925 short Alice <unk> a Puzzle . One of the earliest animated pornographic films was <unk> <unk> in Buried Treasure , produced circa 1928 . It has often been suggested that the film was produced for a private party in honor of Winsor McCay . Rumors suggest that the film was developed in Cuba years after it was completed , because no lab in New York City would process the film . When a print was screened in San Francisco in the late 1970s , the program notes attributed the animation to George Stallings , George <unk> , Rudy Zamora , Sr. and Walter Lantz . 
 The Motion Picture Association of America , then known as the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association , was established in 1922 as the result of public objection to adult content in films , and a series of guidelines were established , suggesting content that should not be portrayed in films . Until the Hays Code was enforced , many animated shorts featured suggestive content , including sexual innuendo , references to alcohol and drug use , and mild profanity . In the 1933 short Bosko 's Picture Show , Bosko appears to use the word " fuck " , although it has also been suggested that the character is saying " fox " , or even " mug " . The Betty Boop series was known for its use of jokes that would eventually be considered taboo following the enforcement of the Hays Code , including the use of nudity . Betty Boop was initially drawn as a dog , and cast as the girlfriend of another Fleischer character , Bimbo . Betty was redesigned as a human , but the series continued to suggest a love relationship between the two that went farther than the normal relationship between humans and their pets . The short Is My Palm Read contains a scene in which Betty is shown as a child between the ages of four and five , bathing in the nude . In the 1970s , this scene was shown out of context in performances by The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo . Concert audiences were not aware that Betty was supposed to be a baby in the sequence . 
 Another short , Bamboo Isle , contains a sequence in which Betty dances the hula topless , wearing only a lei over her breasts and a grass skirt . According to animator Shamus Culhane , Fleischer Studios and Paramount Pictures were shocked by the sequence , but because it was a major sequence , it could not be cut out of the film . Culhane also states that he does not remember any instance in which the film was censored . Betty ’ s hula animation was reused for a cameo appearance with Popeye the Sailor in his self @-@ titled animated debut short . 
 Following the enforcement of the Hays Code , Betty 's clothing was redesigned , and all future shorts portrayed her with a longer dress which did not portray her physique and sexuality . Shorts produced following the enforcement of the Hays Code were also less surreal in nature , and Betty was portrayed as a rational adult . 
 = = = After the Hays Code = = = 
 By 1968 , the Hays Office had been eliminated , and the former guidelines were replaced by the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system . The lifting of the Code meant that animated features from other countries could be distributed without censorship , and that censorship would not be required for American productions . Some underground cartoon films from the late 1960s were also aimed at an adult audience , such as Bambi Meets Godzilla ( 1968 ) and the anti @-@ war films Escalation ( 1968 ) and Mickey Mouse in Vietnam ( 1969 ) . " Escalation " in particular is interesting because it was made by Disney animator Ward Kimball , independently from the Disney Studios . Film producer John Magnuson completed an animated short based upon an audio recording of a comedy routine by Lenny Bruce titled Thank You Mask Man ( 1971 ) , in which The Lone Ranger shocks the residents of the town he saves when he tells them that he wants to have sex with Tonto . The short was made by San Francisco @-@ based company Imagination , Inc. and directed by Jeff Hale , a former member of the National Film Board of Canada . The film was scheduled to premiere on the opening night of Z , as a supplement preceding the main feature , but was not shown . According to a former staff member of the festival , Magnuson ran up the aisle and shouted " They crucified Lenny when he was alive and now that he is dead they are screwing him again ! " The festival 's director told Magnuson that the producer of Z did not want any short shown that night . Rumors suggested that the wife of one of the festival 's financiers hated Bruce , and threatened to withdraw her husband 's money if the short was screened . Thank You Mask Man was later shown in art house screenings , and gained a following , but screenings did not perform well enough financially for Magnuson to profit from the film .

 By the late @-@ 1960s , animator Ralph Bakshi felt that he could not continue to produce the same kind of animation as he had in the past . Bakshi was quoted in a 1971 article for the Los Angeles Times as saying that the idea of " grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers , while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets , is ludicrous . " With producer Steve Krantz , Bakshi founded his own studio , Bakshi Productions , establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators . He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time . 
 In 1969 , Ralph 's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca @-@ Cola and Max , the 2000 @-@ Year @-@ Old Mouse , a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica . However , Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing , and wanted to produce something personal . Bakshi soon developed Heavy Traffic , a tale of inner @-@ city street life . However , Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi 's lack of film experience . While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark 's Place , Bakshi came across a copy of R. Crumb 's Fritz the Cat . Impressed by Crumb 's sharp satire , Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film . 
 Fritz the Cat was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA , and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time . While the film is widely noted in its innovation for featuring content that had not been portrayed in American animation before , such as explicit sexuality and violence , the film also offered commercial potential for alternative and independent animated films in the United States , as the film offered a mature , satirical portrayal of the 1960s , including portrayal of drug use , political tension and race relations . Bakshi has been credited for playing an important role in establishing animation as a medium where any story can be told , rather than a medium for children . As a result of the acceptance of Bakshi 's features , the director suggested that War and Peace could be produced as an animated film . 
 Because of the perception that Fritz the Cat was pornographic , Krantz attempted to appeal the film 's rating , but the MPAA refused to hear the appeal . Praise from Rolling Stone and The New York Times , and the film 's acceptance into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival cleared up previous misconceptions . Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films , starting with Heavy Traffic . Krantz was nervous about showing too much nudity and sexual content , and had several versions of some scenes animated . Thanks to Heavy Traffic , Ralph Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back @-@ to @-@ back . Although the film received critical praise , it was banned by the film censorship board in the province of Alberta , Canada when it was originally released . 
 Bakshi 's next film , Coonskin was produced by Albert S. Ruddy . The film , culled from Bakshi 's interest in African @-@ American history in America , was an attack on racism and racist stereotypes . Bakshi hired several African @-@ American animators to work on Coonskin and another feature , Hey Good Lookin ' , including Brenda Banks , the first African @-@ American female animator . After the release was stalled by protests from the Congress of Racial Equality , which accused both the film and Bakshi himself of being racist , the film was given limited distribution , advertised as an exploitation film , and soon disappeared from theaters . 
 Bakshi avoided controversy by producing fantasy films , including Wizards , The Lord of the Rings and Fire and Ice . Bakshi did not produce another animated feature film after the 1992 release of Cool World .

 Although some adult @-@ oriented animated films achieved success , very few animation studios in the United States produced explicitly adult animation during the 1970s , and much of the adult @-@ oriented animation produced in the 1980s and 1990s was critically and commercially unsuccessful . Krantz produced The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat without Bakshi 's involvement , and it was released in June 1974 to negative reviews . Charles Swenson developed Down and Dirty Duck as a project for Flo and Eddie ( Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman , formerly of The Turtles and The Mothers of Invention ) under the title Cheap ! The film , produced by Roger Corman , was released in July 1974 under the title Dirty Duck , and received negative reviews . 
 The film Who Framed Roger Rabbit ( 1988 ) , distributed by Disney @-@ owned Touchstone Pictures , contains a number of risqué jokes that could barely be seen by audiences , but could be viewed by slowing down laserdisc copies of the film . In one scene , Baby Herman walks under a woman 's dress , raising his hand up her thighs as he passes , and emerging with an extended finger as he brings his hand down . An animator who worked on the film stated that director Robert Zemeckis never intended to censor the scene , as it was one of his favorite moments from the film . Part of the film was animated in England , and one of the film 's British animators drew a sequence in which Jessica Rabbit 's crotch was exposed without Disney 's knowledge . While the image cannot be clearly seen on the VHS , DVD and Blu @-@ ray version of the film , it appeared more clearly on the film 's laserdisc . 
 Animated films portraying serious stories began to regain notice from mainstream audiences in the beginning of the 21st century . Persepolis , a 2007 adaptation of Marjane Satrapi 's autobiographical graphic novel , won the Jury Prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and was later nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature . The Iranian government protested the film 's inclusion in the Festival , but later allowed the film to be screened in a censored version , which altered the film 's sexual content . The 2008 Israeli film Waltz with Bashir , an animated documentary involving the 1982 Lebanon War , was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film . 
 The 2016 film The Killing Joke was the first film in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series and the first animated Batman film to receive an R rating from the MPAA , with Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series president Sam Register explaining , " From the start of production , we encouraged producer Bruce Timm and our team at Warner Bros. Animation to remain faithful to the original story — regardless of the eventual MPAA rating … We felt it was our responsibility to present our core audience — the comics @-@ loving community — with an animated film that authentically represented the tale they know all too well . " The film was released in a limited theatrical screening on July 25 , 2016 .

 In 1988 , San Francisco exhibitor Expanded Cinema screened a compilation of adult @-@ oriented animated shorts under the title " Outrageous Animation " . Advertising the package as containing " the wildest cartoons ever " , the screenings contained shorts produced outside the United States , as well as independently produced American shorts . Reviews of the festival were mixed . San Francisco Chronicle writer Mick LaSalle hated almost everything screened at the festival , with the exception of Bill Plympton 's One of Those Days . In The San Francisco Examiner , David Armstrong gave the show a three @-@ star review and described the films screened as having " some of the rude vitality of the great old Warner Bros. cartoons — and a good deal of the sexual explicitness denied those old favorites from a more cautious age . " 
 In 1990 , Mellow Manor Productions began screening films under the title " Spike and Mike 's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation " . Founders Craig " Spike " Decker and Mike Gribble promoted their festival by handing out flyers on the streets rather than with traditional promotional techniques . In 1991 , Decker and Gribble screened their first " All Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation " , promising " wild and zany films that could never be shown to our ' normal audience ' " . The festival screened newer independent shorts , as well as older shorts such as Bambi Meets Godzilla and Thank You Mask Man . Although the festival promoted works by animators who would later gain mainstream success , such as Plympton , Mike Judge , Trey Parker , and Don Hertzfeldt , many reviewers dismissed the bulk of the programming as shock value . 
 In 2003 , Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt created a new touring festival of animation marketed towards adults and college students . The Animation Show brought animated shorts into more North American theaters than any previous commercial festival . Though intended for adult audiences , the programming skewed more towards Academy Award nominated animated shorts and foreign films than it did explicit material .

 From 1972 to 1974 , Hanna @-@ Barbera produced Wait till Your Father Gets Home , an adult @-@ oriented sitcom in the style of All in the Family . The series dealt with subjects such as feminism and the generation gap . In the 1990s , a number of animated television programs appeared which challenged the Standards & Practices guidelines , including The Simpsons , Beavis and Butt @-@ Head , The Critic , The Brothers Grunt , <unk> , The Ren and Stimpy Show , and Rocko 's Modern Life . The Simpsons originated from series of shorts appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show . Because the shorts and television series aired in prime time , the show was not censored as much as programs intended to air on Saturday mornings . In addition to the show 's portrayal of brief nudity and mild language , the series has dealt with mature themes , subjects such as death , gambling addiction , religion and suicide . 
 As the result of the success of The Simpsons , ABC , CBS and NBC each developed animated series to air in prime time , but none of the shows were successful . One series , Capitol Critters , focused on subjects such as gun control , interracial violence and political corruption . In his review of the series , Variety critic Brian Lowry wrote that he felt that the series ' approach was " muddled " , and that " the bland central character and cartoonish elements [ ... ] will likely be off @-@ putting to many adults , who won 't find the political satire biting enough to merit their continued attention . Similarly , kids probably won 't be as smitten with the cartoon aspects or look " . The series was cancelled after one month . The Critic was somewhat more successful , but achieved low ratings because of ABC 's sporadic scheduling , and was cancelled by the network . The Fox Broadcasting Company picked up the series , but cancelled it four months later . While Fox allowed The Simpsons to portray animated depictions of the human buttocks , ABC would not allow similar scenes to appear on The Critic . 
 Beavis and Butt @-@ head was controversial for its portrayal of brief nudity , profanity and violence . Although the series was intended for adult audiences , it was shown in the afternoons , and multiple parents claimed that their children had imitated the show 's characters . The first instance of such an accusation occurred when animal lovers in Santa Cruz , California claimed that someone had blown up a cat after seeing Beavis and Butt @-@ head perform this act on television . In actuality , no such scene had ever been portrayed . When a five @-@ year @-@ old boy in Ohio set his bed on fire , killing his two @-@ year @-@ old sister , critics claimed that the incident was the result of an episode involving fire , although it has never been proven that the boy had ever watched the series . MTV responded by moving the series to a later airtime and adding disclaimers to future episodes stating explicitly not to imitate the actions of the characters , as well as removing all references to fire from the episodes . 
 Discussions involving a series based upon Trey Parker and Matt Stone 's video Christmas card , The Spirit of Christmas , led HBO to contact Ralph Bakshi in order to produce an animated series targeted specifically toward adults . Bakshi enlisted a team of writers , including his son , Preston , to develop Spicy Detective , later renamed Spicy City , an anthology series set in a noir @-@ ish , technology @-@ driven future . Each episode featuring a different story narrated by a female host named Raven , voiced by Michelle Phillips . The series premiered in July 1997 , beating South Park to television by over a month and becoming the first " adults only " cartoon series . Although critical reaction was mixed and largely unfavorable , Spicy City received acceptable ratings . A second season was approved , but the network wanted to fire Bakshi 's writing team and hire professional Los Angeles screenwriters . When Bakshi refused to cooperate with the network , the series was canceled . 
 Another notable show that paved the future of adult animation is Space Ghost Coast to Coast which is an animated parody talk show hosted by the 60s Hanna @-@ Barbera cartoon character Space Ghost . It was Cartoon Network 's first original program and also the first television show to mix live action and animation . Though it aired at an 11 : 00 pm timeslot , apart from the mild profanity , sexual references and violence it was not particularly risque like other mature shows at the time . In 2001 , Time Warner established Adult Swim as a programming block on Cartoon Network . Its schedule currently includes original programs such as Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies and reruns of syndicated programs such as Family Guy , American Dad ! and King of the Hill ( all of which had their original run on Fox ) . While Adult Swim has been known to air a majority of high impact adult material , there have been some cases where some episodes from certain shows were pulled out of airing schedule for going overboard , one famous example is the animated series Moral Orel . Episodes of this show have depictions of children drinking alcohol and violence against homosexuals . 
 American audiences have become more accepting of adult @-@ oriented animation through the popularity of American @-@ produced comedic television shows . Dramatic series such as Aeon Flux and Invasion America are less common , and still rarely successful . 
 Notable examples of this genre include King of the Hill , Bob 's Burgers , Rick and Morty , The Simpsons , American Dad ! , Family Guy , Aqua Teen Hunger Force , South Park , Archer , Futurama , Beavis and Butt @-@ Head , Space Ghost Coast to Coast , Squidbillies , and The Ren & Stimpy Show . 
 In 2000 <unk> Entertainment produced Australian Gloria 's House , in a series of The Storm and The Long Weekend characters Dorothy <unk> ( voiced Jean Kittson ) and Millicent <unk> ( voiced Michelle <unk> ) , she said appears to use the word fucked and fucking .

 In 1954 , a British studio produced an animated adaptation of George Orwell 's novel Animal Farm . This film is believed to have been one of the earliest examples of British animation , and like the book , is meant to be a portrayal or critique of Stalinism , with characters serving as analogues to figures from the Russian Revolution of 1917 . 
 For many years , it had been problematic to import films that did not meet the approval of the United States Customs Service . In 1972 , the Customs Service refused entry of a short film titled <unk> , depicting scenes of sexual intercourse between characters based upon Cinderella , Little Red Riding Hood , Puss in Boots , Goldilocks and the Three Bears , and Prince Charming . The film was seized as obscene material , and its distributor filed a court case and an appeal in 1974 , but lost both . 
 In 1973 , Rene <unk> directed La Planète sauvage based on the French science fiction novel <unk> en <unk> by Stefan <unk> . It has been aired on TV in the U.S. and U.K. as Fantastic Planet , and several DVD editions have been released . Also in 1973 , an Italian animated movie King Dick appeared , which became a cult cartoon in the UK . A West @-@ German cartoon short called Snow White and the Seven Perverts ( " <unk> unter die Sieben Bergen " ) also appeared . This little film mostly parodies Snow White and has been included as part of other compilation films . 
 Belgian animator <unk> made an entire career of directing animated sex comedy films , such as the Tarzan parody Tarzoon : Shame of the Jungle ( 1975 ) , the Stone Age film The Missing Link ( 1980 ) , the science fiction satire The Big Bang ( 1987 ) and the Snow White parody Snow White : The Sequel ( 2007 ) . The first foreign animated film to receive both an X rating and wide distribution in the United States was Tarzoon : Shame of the Jungle . A dubbed version , which featured new dialogue performed by American actors and comedians such as John Belushi , Adolph Caesar , Brian Doyle @-@ Murray , Judy Graubart , Bill Murray and Johnny Weissmuller Jr . , received an R rating . According to distributor Stuart S. Shapiro , the X rating hurt the film 's distribution , but the dubbed version " took the bite out of the film . It lost its outrageousness . " Tarzoon was banned by the New Zealand Board of Censors in 1980 . 
 In England , Martin Rosen directed two animated feature films based on the novels of Richard Adams : Watership Down in 1978 and The Plague Dogs in 1982 . Both films deal with adult themes : Watership Down the negotiation of leadership to organize an exodus away from persecution , and The Plague Dogs on animal testing . 
 The Wall , an adaptation of Pink Floyd 's concept album of the same name , featured 15 minutes of painstaking traditional animation in addition to numerous live @-@ action sequences ; although the film was not by any stretch pornographic , it was an adult film ( with numerous references to drugs , mental illness and sex , along with one animated sequence portraying a character talking out of his rectum and having a scrotum for a beard ) and received an R rating when imported to the United States . 
 In 1986 , England produced yet another politically @-@ themed animation , When the Wind Blows , about an older couple whose home undergoes a nuclear attack .

 Felidae ( 1994 ) , based on the novel by <unk> <unk> , was an animated film about a cat inspecting various mysterious murders in his local neighborhood . The film is notable for graphic depictions of violence , coarse language and a scene where cats mate with each other . 
 = = Japan = = 
 Adult animation is known in Japan as <unk> ( adult anime ) . In both English and Japanese , the word ' adult ' may carry connotations of a sexual nature , but anime on serious topics such as Akira or Ghost in the Shell often get referred to as ' adult ' in Japan as well , even when sex is not a key part of the story . 
 Animated works of an erotic nature have come to be described in western fandom as ' hentai , ' the Japanese word for ' perverted , ' while in Japan they are more likely to be referred to as <unk> ( R @-@ 18 anime ) or <unk> ( erotic anime ) . 
 Some of the earliest manga magazines were aimed at adults , and this provided a prime source as the basis for adult anime works . Weekly Manga Times began publication in 1956 , and would be followed by Weekly Manga Goraku ( 1964 ) and Manga Action ( 1967 ) . Anime works based on adult manga include Berserk , Hellsing Ultimate , Maison <unk> , Mushishi , Golden Boy , and Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari . 
 In 1969 , Osamu Tezuka and Eiichi Yamamoto released <unk> <unk> Monogatari ( <unk> ) the first of a series of three animated feature films aimed at an adult audience . It was dubbed and released in the United States as One Thousand and One Arabian Nights . Osamu Tezuka and Eiichi Yamamoto collaborated on the second film in the <unk> series <unk> ( <unk> ) released in the United States as Cleopatra : Queen of Sex . The third film <unk> no <unk> ( <unk> ) was directed by Yamamoto alone . It was entered in the Berlin Film festival , but did not achieve commercial success . 
 In 1984 , original video animation ( OVA ) of an erotic nature began to be released , first Lolita Anime by Wonder Kids based on the manga work of Fumio Nakajima , and then later in the year Cream Lemon , a series which proved to be a big hit in Japan . La Blue Girl and New Angel are two other erotic anime to be released in U.S. and Europe in the early 1990s . 
 1988 saw the release of Akira directed by Katsuhiro Otomo which was dubbed and shown in U.S. theaters , and released on VHS around the world . Its success led to a greater interest in Japanese adult anime in the U.S. , and opened the door for other titles . In 1995 , Ghost in the Shell was released as a feature film , directed by Mamoru Oshii based on the manga by Masamune Shirow . It received critical acclaim in both Japan and abroad hinting further at the possibilities of adult animation . 
 The U.S. Adult Swim channel has been airing adult @-@ oriented anime series on their Saturday night Toonami block : Mobile Suit Gundam : Iron @-@ Blooded Orphans , Akame ga KILL ! , <unk> , Attack on Titan , Sword Art Online , Kill la Kill , Hunter x Hunter , Neon Genesis Evangelion , Bleach , Deadman Wonderland , Casshern Sins , Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood , Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig , and Cowboy Bebop . Five of the Japanese TV networks have similar late night anime blocks : Fuji Television 's Noitamina , Mainichi Broadcasting System 's Animeism and Anime Shower , Asahi Broadcasting Corporation 's Wednesday Anime and Yomiuri <unk> Corporation 's <unk> . The programs aired have included Angel Heart , Genji Monogatari <unk> and Hellsing . 
 Starting in 2004 , Mahiro Maeda directed a multi @-@ episode anime adaptation of Alexandre Dumas ' novel as <unk> : The Count of Monte Cristo . It was aired on Animax in Asia , and FUNimation in the United States , and received critical acclaim in the anime press . 
 Although some associate all anime with sexual content , hentai only makes up a very small portion of the Japanese animation industry . As the result of the misconceptions about Japanese animation , some video stores outside Japan have classified children 's anime as for adults only . Many video stores have also categorized all adult @-@ oriented animation as anime , including the works of Ralph Bakshi , the French animated film Fantastic Planet , the Canadian animated film Heavy Metal and the HBO television series Todd McFarlane 's Spawn . In the case of Spawn , Todd McFarlane directly listed anime as an influence , particularly Otomo 's Akira , and stated his hope that the show would help encourage the rise of adult animation on North American networks . This in part lead to the involvement of the Japanese studio Mad House in the production , in an attempt to " combine " the Eastern and Western styles .

 The Royal Australian Regiment ( RAR ) is the parent administrative regiment for regular infantry battalions of the Australian Army and is the senior infantry regiment of the Royal Australian Infantry Corps . It was originally formed in 1948 as a three battalion regiment ; however , since then its size has fluctuated as battalions have been raised , amalgamated or disbanded in accordance with the Australian government 's strategic requirements . Currently , the regiment consists of seven battalions and has fulfilled various roles including those of light , parachute , motorised and mechanised infantry . Throughout its existence , units of the Royal Australian Regiment have deployed on operations in Japan , Korea , Malaya , Borneo , Vietnam , Somalia , Rwanda , Cambodia , East Timor , the Solomon Islands , Iraq and Afghanistan .

 The origins of the Royal Australian Regiment lie in the decision made by the Australian government to raise a force for occupation duties in Japan at the end of the Second World War . The 34th Australian Infantry Brigade was raised in October 1945 from Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) personnel then serving in the South West Pacific Area , with the three battalions of the brigade designated as the 65th , 66th and 67th Australian Infantry Battalions of the AIF . The 65th Battalion was formed from volunteers from the 7th Division and the 2 / 40th Battalion . The 66th Battalion received volunteers from the 9th Division and 1st Australian Corps troops . The 67th Battalion was formed from the 3rd , 6th , and 11th Divisions . After concentrating on the island of Morotai , the 34th Brigade moved to Japan and joined the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in February 1946 . 
 The 34th Brigade became the basis of the post @-@ war Regular Army in 1947 , and when the decision was taken in 1948 to withdraw two of the battalions to Australia , attention turned to the status and designation of these units . Brigadier Ronald Hopkins , commander of the brigade , was concerned that despite the unit prestige and regimental spirit developed since October 1945 , it would be undesirable to have the regular units the highest numbered , without battle honours or colours , and with precedence after Militia units . Consideration was given to whether the battalions might be designated as separate regiments . For example , the 65th Battalion might have become the 1st Infantry Battalion , City of Sydney 's Own Regiment under one proposal or the 1st Battalion , King George VI 's Australian Rifle Regiment under another . Instead , the decision was taken to number the units sequentially as part of one large regiment and so on 23 November 1948 the 65th , 66th and 67th Battalions became the 1st , 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Australian Regiment . An application was made for a royal title , which was granted on 10 March 1949 . The Royal Australian Regiment thus came into being as Australia 's first regiment of regular infantry . Since formation the battalions of the regiment have competed against each other in an annual military skills competition known as the Gloucester Cup . 
 = = = Early years : Japan and Australia , 1948 – 50 = = = 
 The formation of the regiment following the end of the Second World War was fundamentally important to the post @-@ war Australian Army , forming a key component of the first " permanent , professional army , available in peace and war for any task the government might direct " . Prior to this time the Australian Army had been substantially a part @-@ time militia with a permanent cadre . A major influence in the raising of the regiment was Australia 's desire to secure a prominent role in the occupation of Japan and the eventual peace settlement . After some delays the 65th , 66th and 67th Battalions arrived in Japan 's Hiroshima Prefecture in February 1946 . Subsequent employment " involved activities designed to reinforce upon the Japanese the lesson of their defeat " , in addition to guard duty , patrolling and training . In December 1948 the Australian component of the BCOF was reduced from a brigade to one understrength battalion , with the 1st and 2nd Battalions returning to Australia , while the 3rd Battalion remained in Japan . 
 On return to Australia the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade . The 1st Battalion was subsequently based in Ingleburn , New South Wales , and the 2nd Battalion at Puckapunyal , Victoria . Both units were significantly understrength as many men discharged on returning to Australia , while others elected to remain in Japan with the 3rd Battalion . Alan Morrison , a former member of the regiment , later recalled that for the two battalions that returned to Australia " ... the first eighteen months of the regiment 's existence were harrowing times " . Many men discharged due to frustration and discontent , while the battalions were not strong enough to undertake meaningful training activities and their barracks were in a state of disrepair . Yet from this experience came the core " ... of dedicated soldiers destined to be the non @-@ commissioned officers of the regiment in the Korean War and the outstanding warrant officers and sergeants of the battalions that served in Malaya and in the early part of the Vietnam campaign " . 
 The regiment has provided units and individuals for virtually all Australian Army deployments and operations since its formation . The first period of sustained operational service began with the regiment 's first deployment in Korea in 1950 and continued until the withdrawal of combat units from Vietnam in 1972 . These 22 years were arguably the most significant for the regiment with between one and three battalions involved in combat operations in South @-@ East Asia at any one time . A second lengthy period of operational service commenced with the intervention in East Timor in 1999 , which became the first of many commitments for the regiment that have continued to the present day . Approximately 85 @,@ 000 personnel have served in the RAR during this time , with casualties sustained by the regiment on operations including 693 killed and over 3 @,@ 000 wounded . 
 = = = Korean War , 1950 – 53 = = = 
 The Korean War was the first major test of the regiment . Following preparations in Japan , 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September 1950 and was attached to the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade . The initial invasion of South Korea by the North Korean People 's Army ( NKPA ) had been broken by General Douglas MacArthur 's amphibious landing at Inchon , and so , in what was a complicated war of manoeuvre , 3 RAR was involved in the pursuit of the NKPA back across the 38th parallel . On 21 October 1950 , 3 RAR took part in the Battle of Yongju in an apple orchard north of Pyongyang , the first large @-@ scale engagement fought by a battalion of the regiment . The farthest north 3 RAR would advance into North Korea was the Pakchon – Chongju area following the Battle of Chongju , and it was near here that Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Green , the battalion 's commanding officer , was mortally wounded on 30 October 1950 . By November 1950 , following the Chinese intervention , 3 RAR was withdrawing south along with the rest of the allied Eighth Army , fighting the Battle of Pakchon . However , following a UN counteroffensive a defensive line was established about 45 kilometres ( 28 mi ) north of Seoul and it was here in April 1951 that 3 RAR , along with the 2nd Battalion , Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry and supporting UN forces , fought a successful defensive action at the Battle of Kapyong . This battle proved to be the climactic point of the regiment 's first year in Korea . 
 By June 1951 , 3 RAR moved to a position on the Imjin River under the command of the US I Corps and it was here that the battalion would spend the next two years of the war . The major action fought by the regiment in the second half of 1951 was the Battle of Maryang San , where 3 RAR , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frank Hassett , assaulted Hill 317 on 5 October 1951 . Known as Operation Commando , Hill 317 was captured after five days of hard fighting . Following this action the war was defined by fixed defences of trenches , bunkers and wire , constant patrolling , and numerous clashes . In April 1952 , 3 RAR was joined by 1 RAR and command of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade , of which they were now a part , passed to an Australian officer as a result . Meanwhile , the expansion of the commitment in Korea to two battalions resulted in the establishment of a regimental depot at Ingleburn in 1952 to train and hold infantrymen for service in Korea . In April 1953 , 1 RAR was replaced by 2 RAR on a system of unit rotation . During this changeover a parade was held to mark the first occasion that all battalions of the regiment had been on parade together . 1 RAR served a year in Korea , 2 RAR for four months before the armistice , while 3 RAR served throughout the war , earning itself the nickname of " Old Faithful " . The last major action of the war for the regiment was the Battle of the Samichon River fought by 2 RAR over 24 – 26 July 1953 , repulsing a number of major Chinese assaults just hours before the Armistice Agreement was signed . 
 Following the armistice both sides withdrew and a demilitarised zone was created . The period that followed proved uneventful , yet the UN forces were required to maintain combat readiness and the ability to react quickly in case the North Koreans violated the ceasefire . In April 1954 , 2 RAR returned to Australia and was replaced by 1 RAR which remained in South Korea until March 1956 . 3 RAR finally returned to Australia in September 1954 after four years of continuous service in Korea and five years before that in Japan . Total Army casualties in Korea included 293 killed , 1 @,@ 210 wounded and 23 captured , the majority being infantrymen of the Royal Australian Regiment . The fighting in Korea provided the regiment with valuable combat experience , establishing a foundation for its further development and marking the emergence of the Australian Regular Army . The Korean War remains the only large @-@ scale , conventional war that the regiment has fought . During this time the Army developed the capability to maintain two battalions on major operations at the same time . 
 = = = Malaya and Borneo , 1955 – 66 = = = 
 In April 1955 the Australian government had committed army , navy and air force elements to the Far East Strategic Reserve to assist in the defence of Malaya from internal and external security threats . While British Commonwealth forces had been operating against the communist terrorists since 1948 , the battalions of the regiment came relatively late to the Malayan Emergency , and when 2 RAR arrived in theatre in October 1955 the war had been running for over seven years . 2 RAR was replaced by 3 RAR in 1957 , which was in turn replaced by 1 RAR in 1959 . During the Emergency the three battalions were involved in 45 contacts , killing 17 guerrillas for the loss of seven men killed in action . According to Jim <unk> the attention to detail required of five years of infantry soldiering in Malaya exposed the regiment to jungle warfare skills developed by the British Army during its most successful counterinsurgency war . This experience later informed the development of its own doctrine , with the Malayan Emergency making a significant contribution to the professionalism of the regiment . Meanwhile , the regimental depot — which had been renamed 4 RAR soon after formation — was subsequently incorporated into the School of Infantry and renamed Depot Company , Royal Australian Regiment in 1960 . Despite the end of the State of Emergency in Malaya , 1 RAR was employed on anti @-@ terrorist operations along the Thai border in late 1960 . 1 RAR was replaced in Malaya by 2 RAR in 1961 , with the battalion involved in training and counter @-@ terrorist operations . It was subsequently employed on operations along the Thai border for three months in mid @-@ 1962 , and again in May and June 1963 , being involved in a number of minor contacts . 2 RAR handed over to 3 RAR in August , and returned to Australia . 3 RAR was also committed to operations along the Thai border in early 1964 . 
 Between 1963 and 1966 , Indonesia pursued a policy of Konfrontasi , or Confrontation , with Malaysia . 3 RAR , which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca on mainland Malaysia , was subsequently used with British and New Zealand forces to mop up two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964 . On 13 February 1965 , 3 RAR was warned for service in Sarawak on the island of Borneo , commencing in March . 3 RAR completed a four @-@ month tour mounting numerous security patrols in its area of operations , including a number of sensitive cross @-@ border patrols into the Indonesian regency of Sarawak as a part of Operation Claret , which resulted in actions at Sungei Koemba , <unk> and <unk> , between late May and July . Operations on the Sarawak border " were a severe test of the skill , discipline and professionalism of the infantry , involving long periods in the jungle or in the company bases . " Out of the 30 Claret operations conducted by 3 RAR , 12 were reconnaissance patrols , while the remainder were ambushes or fighting patrols , four of which resulted in contact with Indonesian forces . 4 RAR , having been reformed as a battalion the previous year , assumed responsibility from 3 RAR at Camp Terendak in October 1965 . Deploying forward to Borneo in April 1966 , it remained there until September and like its predecessor , conducted a demanding routine of internal security and cross @-@ border patrols . 
 = = = Expansion of the regiment , 1960s = = = 
 The early 1960s were a period of strategic uncertainty and increasing commitments in South East Asia . Consequently , the Australian government re @-@ introduced selective conscription in late @-@ 1964 and directed a significant increase in the strength of the Army . Yet unlike during the 1950s when National Servicemen bolstered the strength of CMF , under the new scheme they would serve for two years in the Regular Army instead . This substantial period of service for the regiment in Australia , Malaysia , and Vietnam saw the government direct the expansion of the regiment from four to nine battalions . By September 1965 the regiment consisted of seven battalions ; by July 1966 , eight ; and by November 1967 , nine . 4 RAR was formed in February 1964 ; 1 RAR abandoned the Pentropic Establishment ( 1 @,@ 300 personnel ) to revert to the Tropical Establishment ( 800 personnel ) , allowing 5 RAR to form in March 1965 ; 6 RAR was formed from a cadre drawn from 2 RAR in June 1965 ; 3 RAR assisted the formation of 7 RAR in September 1965 ; 8 RAR formed in August 1966 ; and 9 RAR was raised in November 1967 . 
 = = = Vietnam War , 1962 – 72 = = = 
 Although individual members of the regiment had served as advisors with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam ( AATTV ) since 1962 , it was not until April 1965 that the government announced that a battalion would be deployed to Vietnam . Between June 1965 and March 1972 the units of the regiment would conduct sixteen rotations in Vietnam , with the first seven battalions completing two 12 @-@ month tours , while 8 and 9 RAR would each serve one . Consequently , following a period of hurried training and administration 1 RAR joined the US 173rd Airborne Brigade at Bien Hoa airbase outside of Saigon in June 1965 . After initially defending the airbase , 1 RAR steadily increased the scope of its patrols . For example , in January 1966 , 1 RAR assaulted a large Viet Cong headquarters complex in the Ho Bo Woods as a part of Operation Crimp ; which the Americans hailed as the first strategic intelligence victory of the war . The battalion subsequently completed a 12 month @-@ tour attached to US forces , during which it developed new tactics and techniques that later became standard for Australian battalions and supporting arms and services that would subsequently operate in Vietnam . 
 In March 1966 , Prime Minister Harold Holt announced that Australia would increase its commitment to Vietnam . In May 1966 the newly raised 5 and 6 RAR arrived in theatre as a part of the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 ATF ) in Phuoc Tuy Province , establishing a base at Nui Dat . After two months of constant patrolling by both battalions , 6 RAR was engaged in the action that would become a defining part of the regiment 's war in Vietnam ; the Battle of Long Tan . Fought on 18 August 1966 , 108 men from D Company , 6 RAR fought a ferocious meeting engagement with the Viet Cong 275th Regiment , possibly reinforced by at least one North Vietnamese battalion , and D445 Battalion ( between 1 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 500 personnel ) . After fighting for two and a half hours , D Company was surrounded on three sides . However , with the assistance of strong artillery support they were able to hold their position until the timely arrival of a relief force of infantry and armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) finally forced the Viet Cong to break . In the words of the official historian , Ian McNeill , " D Company had achieved a stunning victory " . 
 In 1967 , 2 and 7 RAR assumed responsibility in Phuoc Tuy from their predecessors and continued the extensive patrolling , and cordon and searches characteristic of this conflict . In August 1967 , 7 RAR fought elements of the Viet Cong 3rd Battalion , 274th Regiment in the largely unheralded Battle of Suoi Chau Pha , where extensive artillery support again proved decisive . A third infantry battalion arrived in December 1967 as part of a significant expansion of 1 ATF . By the time of the Tet Offensive in 1968 , 1 and 3 RAR were serving in theatre . During actions at Fire Support Base ( FSB ) Coral by 1 RAR and at FSB Balmoral by 3 RAR in May and June 1968 , later known as the Battle of Coral – Balmoral , these two battalions of the regiment would fight battles with conventional attributes not seen since Kapyong . In June 1969 , an infantry company from 5 RAR , then on its second tour , and supported by a troop of tanks and another of APCs fought a significant combined arms action against a battalion @-@ sized force of North Vietnamese regulars and Viet Cong local force troops during the Battle of Binh Ba . 
 Following Binh Ba , the remainder of the regiment 's commitment to Vietnam would be characterised largely by the policies of " Pacification " and " Vietnamization " , with an emphasis on ambushing and patrolling to protect the local population and training South Vietnamese troops to increasingly replace US and allied forces . The withdrawal of Australian forces from South Vietnam began in November 1970 when 8 RAR completed its tour of duty and was not replaced . Where possible , the Australians still sought to bring Viet Cong units to battle , such as during Operation North Ward , where V Company , 4 RAR / NZ fought elements of the Chau Duc and Ba Long guerrilla units in August and September 1971 . On 18 August 1971 , Prime Minister William McMahon announced that 1 ATF would cease operations in October , with the last combat elements of the regiment ( D Company , 4 RAR ) returning to Australia in February 1972 . The regiment sustained losses of 325 killed and over 2 @,@ 000 wounded in Vietnam . 
 = = = Peacetime service , 1973 – 98 = = = 
 With the withdrawal of the battalion serving in Singapore as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve , 1973 finally saw all units of the regiment stationed in Australia for the first time . Thus began a period of peace @-@ time soldiering of a sort not before seen in the regiment . The end of National Service significantly diminished the strength of the Army , and at this time the government directed that the number of battalions in the regiment be reduced to six , which was achieved by linking 2 and 4 RAR , 5 and 7 RAR , and 8 and 9 RAR . The strength of units and resources were also reduced , with a shift in strategic and tactical concepts from forward defence to defence of continental Australia . Regardless , from September 1973 the battalions of the regiment provided a company on three monthly rotations to Rifle Company Butterworth in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements . Meanwhile , the 10th Independent Rifle Company , Royal Australian Regiment ( 10 IRC ) was raised on 23 May 1974 to provide an opposing force for units training at the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra . 
 The 1980s saw the introduction of battalion specialisations — light , parachute , mechanised and motorised — in the regiment and the formation of a ready deployment force . The later concept was first tested during Operation Morris Dance , the contingency mounted in response to the 1987 Fiji coup . 5 / 7 RAR subsequently developed as a mechanised battalion equipped with M113 armoured personnel carriers , while 3 RAR re @-@ roled as a parachute battalion . In 1988 , during the Australian Bicentennial celebrations , a contingent drawn from the battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Salter of 1 RAR , supported by an Australian Army Band , was deployed as part of the bicentennial celebrations to mount public duties at Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle , St James ' Palace and the Tower of London , the first Australian troops to do so since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 . In 1991 , the two Brisbane @-@ based battalions — 6 RAR and 8 / 9 RAR — then part of the 6th Brigade , became Ready Reserve battalions . Following trials of the concept 6 RAR <unk> as a motorised battalion in 1992 , while 8 / 9 RAR commenced is conversion in 1996 . Each battalion was initially issued modified 6x6 Land Rover <unk> until a purpose @-@ built infantry mobility vehicle could be acquired . 
 Although individual members of the regiment served on deployment in such locations as the Sinai , the Balkans , Western Sahara and Bougainville , it was not until 1993 that the regiment conducted another formed @-@ body deployment . On 15 December 1992 the government announced that 1 RAR would deploy as a part of the US @-@ led and UN @-@ sanctioned Operation Restore Hope in Somalia . The Australian commitment , known as Operation Solace , saw 1 RAR deployed for 17 weeks to a 17 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 6 @,@ 600 sq mi ) Humanitarian Relief Sector ( HRS ) centred on the township of Baidoa . In the course of four months over 8 @,@ 311 tonnes of humanitarian aid was delivered . 1 RAR also protected Baidoa airfield , provided security in the township , conducted in @-@ depth patrolling of the HRS , as well as escorting aid convoys within it . 1 RAR was never seriously challenged by the Somali bandits , although there were a number of contacts which resulted in casualties on both sides . One Australian was accidentally killed during the deployment . 
 In May 1993 , a detachment from 12 Platoon , D Company , 2 / 4 RAR was deployed to Cambodia to provide security to the Australian contribution to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia . Operating from Battambang airport in north @-@ west Cambodia in support of the Army Aviation Group , they conducted static defensive tasks , patrolling and provided a ready reaction force . They joined another detachment of personnel from 5 / 7 RAR 's Support Company , which had been deployed to undertake communications tasks as part of the Force Communications Unit . The deployment came to an end in November 1993 . In 1994 , the raising of a fifth battalion was approved , with 2 / 4 RAR de @-@ linked the following year , and 4 RAR returning to the order of battle in its own right . 
 Between August 1994 and August 1995 , two companies of the regiment , initially A Company , 2 / 4 RAR and then B Company , 2 RAR , served with the Australian contingent of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda ( UNAMIR ) . From 20 to 23 April 1995 , a 50 @-@ member detachment , including infantrymen from 5 Platoon , B Company , 2 RAR were forced to witness the Kibeho Massacre of around 4 @,@ 000 Hutu refugees at the Kibeho camp by members of the Rwandan Patriotic Army . Vastly outnumbered and frustrated by a mandate that did not allow them to engage the perpetrators , the infantrymen were forced into a passive role during the massacre . Throughout the incident , however , they worked under fire attempting to assist wounded refugees . Meanwhile , 8 / 9 RAR was disbanded in 1997 after the discontinuation of the Ready Reserve scheme . 
 = = = East Timor , Solomon Islands , Iraq and Afghanistan , 1999 – Present = = = 
 East Timor 's ballot in favour of independence after 24 years of Indonesian occupation on 30 August 1999 resulted in a wave of violence by militia groups and pro @-@ integration factions within the Indonesian military . 2 , 3 and 5 / 7 RAR were subsequently deployed from 20 September 1999 as part of the UN @-@ sanctioned International Force for East Timor ( INTERFET ) , charged with restoring peace and overseeing the Indonesian departure . Despite minor clashes , including a contact at <unk> on the Indonesian border on 10 October 1999 , control was quickly established and INTERFET handed over to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( UNTAET ) in February 2000 . At this time , 5 / 7 RAR become the first battalion of the regiment to serve under UN command since the Korean War . From 1999 to 2004 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 / 7 , and 6 RAR would all serve in East Timor twice , giving the regiment a wealth of operational experience . One soldier was accidentally killed during these operations , while several more were wounded . Two years after being withdrawn , the deteriorating situation in the country — by then known as Timor Leste — again saw units of the regiment deployed to conduct stabilisation and security operations , this time under Operation Astute . In response to the initial crisis , 3 RAR was deployed along with special forces from 4 RAR ( Commando ) and the Special Air Service Regiment ( SASR ) in May 2006 . It was replaced in early September by a combined Australian and New Zealand battle group based on 6 RAR , designated the ANZAC Battle Group . Subsequent rotations included elements of 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 8 / 9 RAR in the years that followed . After a phased drawdown , the last elements were withdrawn in 2013 . Events in East Timor largely overshadowed developments in Solomon Islands , where elements of the regiment also served periodically from 2003 onwards . One member of the regiment died during operations in the Solomon Islands . 
 The regiment had only a minor role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq , providing a force element of about 40 Commandos from 4 RAR to support the Special Forces Task Group , which was based on an SASR Squadron . Following the invasion , the deteriorating security situation in Baghdad saw the deployment of a combined arms Security Detachment ( <unk> ) , charged with protecting the Australian embassy and its personnel . Over a dozen companies of the regiment provided force elements to the various rotations . In February 2005 Prime Minister John Howard committed a battle group to southern Iraq to partially replace a Dutch unit that had been operating in the Governorate of Al Muthanna . The regiment 's contribution to the first battle group , initially known as the Al Muthanna Task Group , was a rifle company , although the second and third rotations were led by 5 / 7 RAR and 2 RAR respectively . When Provincial Iraqi Control was declared in Al Muthanna in July 2006 , <unk> 3 , led by 2 RAR , was renamed the Overwatch Battle Group ( West ) ( OBG ( W ) ) . The fifth battle group to serve in Iraq was based on 5 RAR , by which time OBG ( W ) was operating in both the Al Muthanna and <unk> <unk> Governorates as a part of the British Multi @-@ National Division South East ( MND ( SE ) ) . ( <unk> 1 , OBG ( W ) 2 and OBG ( W ) 4 were all based on cavalry regiment headquarters ) . During this time elements of the regiment conducted counterinsurgency operations until withdrawn in mid @-@ 2008 . Casualties in Iraq included one member of the regiment who was accidentally killed . 
 Meanwhile , a Reconstruction Taskforce ( <unk> ) based around the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment with protective elements from the 5 / 7 RAR , 6 RAR and 2nd Cavalry Regiment began arriving in Uruzgan Province in southern Afghanistan in early September 2006 as part of Operation Slipper . The <unk> formed part of a Dutch @-@ led Provincial Reconstruction Team , operating as part of Task Force Uruzgan and based at Forward Operating Base Ripley , outside of Tarin Kowt . However , as the Australian commitment expanded , by 2010 the task force had evolved into a combined arms battalion @-@ sized battle group consisting of infantry , engineers , cavalry , artillery and logistic elements , usually based on a unit of the Royal Australian Regiment . Known as the Mentoring Task Force ( MTF ) , it formed part of a multinational brigade known as Combined Team Uruzgan and was tasked with counter @-@ insurgency operations in conjunction with United States and other coalition forces . Partnered with the 4th Brigade , 205th Corps of the Afghan National Army ( ANA ) , it operated throughout Uruzgan Province . While attached to MTF @-@ 1 , soldiers from Combat Team Delta ( based on D Company , 6 RAR ) took part in heavy fighting during the Battle of Derapet in <unk> <unk> on 24 August 2010 . Corporal Daniel Keighran was later awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia for his role in the battle , the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment to receive the award . The task force was withdrawn in late 2013 following the handover of the province to Afghan forces , although a small force protection element remains as part of the ongoing but reduced Australian training and advisory mission . Twelve members of the regiment have been killed in Afghanistan . 
 = = = Special Operations = = = 
 The Special Air Service Regiment owes its heritage to the RAR . Originally formed as the 1st SAS Company in 1957 , in 1960 it became an independent company of the RAR and was tasked with providing the army 's special operations capability . The SASR became a regiment in its own right on 20 August 1964 , severing the link with the RAR at this time . Re @-@ raised as a commando battalion from 1997 , 4 RAR ( Commando ) served in East Timor as a conventional light @-@ role battalion in 2001 , before focusing on the development of its special operations capability . In this role the battalion was designed to be a flexible , self @-@ contained force element able to deploy at short notice to undertake offensive operations in support of Australia 's national interests . Once full operational capability was reached , elements of 4 RAR ( Commando ) would serve in Timor Leste , Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as providing a domestic counter terrorism capability as part of Tactical Assault Group ( East ) . In 2009 , 4 RAR ( Commando ) was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment , and as such is no longer part of the RAR . Rather than being formally disbanded , 4 RAR remained on the Army 's order of battle with its colours and traditions maintained and protected , ready to be re @-@ raised in the future if required . 
 = = = Reorganisation , 2005 – 14 = = = 
 In 2005 , the Australian Army began planning for a reorganisation as part of an initiative known as " Hardening the Army " . The key impact of this plan on the regiment was that 3 RAR would surrender its parachute role , moving from Sydney to Adelaide to become the Army 's second mechanised battalion . However , in August 2006 the government announced that the regiment would expand from five to seven battalions , with the initiative retitled " Hardening and Networking the Army " . As such , 5 / 7 RAR conducted a de @-@ linking parade on 3 December 2006 , reforming as 5 RAR and 7 RAR . 5 RAR reformed in a largely mature state and included a company serving on operations in Iraq , while 7 RAR reformed with a company on operations in Afghanistan . Both battalions remained in the mechanised role . Meanwhile , the regiment marked its 60th Birthday on 23 November 2008 with a parade at Victoria Barracks , Sydney , including a Queens Guard provided by 3 RAR and the Colours of the Regiment . Achieving operational status in 2009 , 7 RAR relocated to Adelaide in 2011 . Under the new scheme 3 RAR relinquished the parachute role , becoming a light infantry battalion . It subsequently relocated to Townsville in 2012 . 8 / 9 RAR reformed as a motorised battalion at Enoggera on 31 October 2007 in the last element of the Enhanced Land Force , and was equipped with Bushmaster <unk> . It subsequently served on operations in Timor Leste and Afghanistan . 
 In 2009 , the reorganisation was again re @-@ titled , this time as the " Adaptive Army " which sought to re @-@ balance the Army and shape it to become an adaptive , learning organisation . Under the Plan Beersheba element of the Adaptive Army reforms announced in 2011 and confirmed in the 2013 Defence White Paper , the three Regular Army brigades will be restructured between 2014 and 2017 into three Combat Brigades with a similar structure and capabilities , each consisting of : a Brigade Headquarters , an Armoured Cavalry Regiment , two Standard Infantry Battalions , an Artillery Regiment , a Combat Engineer Regiment , a Combat Service Support Battalion and a Combat Signals Regiment . With the establishment of the Armoured Cavalry Regiments , 5 and 7 RAR have begun giving up their M113 armoured personnel carriers as they re @-@ role as light infantry . Meanwhile , the motorised battalions are also re @-@ <unk> as light infantry with a transport squadron being established in each Combat Service Support Battalion equipped with Bushmaster <unk> to provide protected mobility . 2 RAR has been selected to specialise in amphibious warfare .

 = His Band and the Street Choir = 
 His Band and the Street Choir ( also referred to as Street Choir ) is the fourth studio album by Northern Irish singer @-@ songwriter Van Morrison . It was released on 15 November 1970 by Warner Bros. Records . Originally titled Virgo 's Fool , Street Choir was renamed by Warner Bros. without Morrison 's consent . Recording began in early 1970 with a demo session in a small church in Woodstock , New York . Morrison booked the A & R Studios on 46th Street in New York City in the second quarter of 1970 to produce two sessions of songs that were released on His Band and the Street Choir . 
 Reviewers praised the music of both sessions for its free , relaxed sound , but the lyrics were considered to be simple compared with those of his previous work . Morrison had intended to record the album a cappella with only vocal backing by a vocal group he called the Street Choir , but the songs released on the album that included the choir also featured a backing band . Morrison was dissatisfied with additional vocalists to the original quintet that made up the choir , and these changes and others have led him to regard Street Choir poorly in later years . 
 His Band and the Street Choir was as well received as Morrison 's previous album , Moondance , peaking at number 32 on the Billboard 200 and number 18 on the UK Album Chart . It owes its success mainly to the US Top Ten single " Domino " , which was released before the album and surpassed Morrison 's 1967 hit , " Brown Eyed Girl " . As of 2010 , " Domino " remains the most successful single of Morrison 's solo career . Two other singles were released from the album , " Blue Money " and " Call Me Up in Dreamland " ; although less successful , they still managed to reach the Billboard Hot 100 .

 Recording began with a demo session at a small church in Woodstock , which was not intended to produce any official releases . During its course Morrison worked on leftover material from his previous two albums ( Astral Weeks and Moondance ) , recorded songs that he had not performed in the studio before ( " Crazy Face " and " Give Me a Kiss " ) , as well as two instrumentals . Limited recording equipment was used , operated by drummer Dahaud Shaar , who was intending to open a recording studio in Woodstock at the time . Shaar remembered : " I found an old church and we would just load in . I 'd set up a pair of mikes and we would just run down some tracks with the tapes running . They became like a working thing for the album . " 
 For his new band Morrison brought back three musicians from the Moondance sessions : saxophonist Jack Schroer ; guitarist John Platania and bassist John Klingberg . The backing vocal trio of Emily Houston , Judy Clay and Jackie Verdell also returned to sing on " If I Ever Needed Someone " . Multi @-@ instrumentalist Dahaud Shaar joined for His Band and the Street Choir ; he was a veteran of the Moondance tour , though he had not played on the album . Keyboardist Alan Hand joined Morrison 's band in late April 1970 , replacing Jef Labes , who had left the band and moved to Israel before the end of the year . Keith Johnson completed the line @-@ up on trumpet and Hammond organ . 
 Between March and May 1970 Morrison began work on the album at the A & R recording studios in New York City . He intended to create a full a capella record , and with this in mind assembled a vocal group he called the Street Choir , consisting of his friends Dahaud Shaar , Larry Goldsmith , Andrew Robinson and then wife , Janet " Planet " Rigsbee , who all lived near Woodstock . He had wanted the choir to feature only four vocalists , but was persuaded to allow two additional members to join : the wives of Keith Johnson and Jack Schroer ( Martha Velez and Ellen Schroer ) . However , Morrison was later persuaded to abandon the use of a cappella : " I had a group of people in mind for the Street Choir ... I asked them if they wanted to sing ... then the old ladies got involved and it ruined the whole thing . " He was unhappy with the tracks recorded with the choir , as he wanted to use the group for a different effect : " I wanted these certain guys to form an a cappella group so that I could cut a lot of songs with just maybe one guitar . But it didn 't turn out . " During this session Morrison recorded the same tracks used for the demo session in Woodstock , as well as " Gypsy Queen " and an additional instrumental , six of which were used on Street Choir . Elliot Scheiner was used as the engineer for this session , after he helped to produce Moondance . However , according to biographer Clinton Heylin , Scheiner and Morrison had a disagreement , so he was not used for the rest of the album . 
 Morrison returned to the A & R studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album . For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer , though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him : " Elliot thought he was going to be the co @-@ producer , but then again I never saw him calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn 't consider myself co @-@ producer . Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers , but it was never a defined role . " Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings , and notably reworked the song " Street Choir " shortly before studio work concluded . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Some songs featured on His Band and the Street Choir were first recorded for the albums Astral Weeks and Moondance . Morrison rewrote and rearranged them for release on Street Choir because the recordings for his new album featured different personnel and instrumentation . The songs on the album , which Rolling Stone reviewer Jon Landau believes have a free , relaxed sound to them , borrow from various music genres ; the simple lyrics lack the complexity popularly expected from Morrison 's work . 
 The first recording that would feature on His Band and the Street Choir was " I 've Been Working " , an out @-@ take from the Astral Weeks sessions in 1968 and the Moondance sessions in 1969 . The final version produced on His Band and the Street Choir is upbeat and shows the influence of James Brown . Morrison notably sings the line " Woman , woman , woman , you make me feel alright " in unison with the horn section , which Jon Landau describes as " breathtaking " . 
 " Domino " had been recorded many times before its release . The first was in sessions from September to November 1968 , just after Astral Weeks was recorded . Morrison rearranged " Domino " frequently from 1968 to 1970 , notably recording rap and harmony versions . For its release it was arranged in a moderate 4 / 4 tempo and features rhythm guitar . Horn overdubs were later added to the recording . Morrison ad libs between the end of the chorus and the start of the verses , when he shouts the words " Dig it ! " , as well as near the end with " And the band ... one more time ! " , which , according to biographer Peter Mills , helps bring out the theme of " liveliness " in both the song and the album as a whole . The song was considered by musicologist Brian Hinton as a tribute to pianist and singer @-@ songwriter , Fats Domino . As with " Domino " , Morrison first recorded " If I Ever Needed Someone " in late 1968 ; it is one of many blues @-@ influenced tracks on the album . 
 " Virgo Clowns " was first recorded at the start of 1969 as " ( Sit Down ) Funny Face " . Morrison next recorded it during the first Street Choir session , renaming it simply " Funny Face " . It was re @-@ recorded during the second session under the completely different title of " Virgo Clowns " . In its final form , Morrison and John Platania duet on acoustic guitars . As the song fades out laughter is heard performed by Dahaud Shaar and Larry Goldsmith . 
 " Crazy Face " evolved from " Going Around with Jesse James " , a song Morrison first recorded for Astral Weeks on 15 October 1968 . Both songs contain references to American outlaw Jesse James . Morrison arranged " Crazy Face " in the irregular time signature 8 / 4 ; the first , third and seventh beats of the bar are emphasised . It begins with a gentle piano introduction , and ends abruptly , which , in Peter Mills ' view , represents a shot from a gun , consistent with the American outlaw theme . 
 " Give Me a Kiss " and " Gypsy Queen " are the final songs recorded during the first recording session . Morrison wrote " Give me a Kiss " about either Planet or his newly born baby girl Shana . It is a twelve bar blues in the style of boogie rock , a music genre prominent in the 1960s , leading reviewers to compare the song to the work of The Beatles and Elvis Presley . Reviewers believed the song " Gypsy Queen " was inspired by " Gypsy Woman " , first recorded by Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions . Johnny Rogan feels the song is " a failed attempt to recapture the spirit of ' Caravan ' " , another Morrison composition inspired by " Gypsy Woman " , released on the album Moondance . Morrison sings the song in falsetto , while keyboardist Alan Hand plays celeste , imitating a music box at both the beginning and end . 
 The second recording session yielded the remaining material . " Call Me Up in Dreamland " is a gospel @-@ style composition . The lyrics refer to life on the road , as Morrison was touring when he recorded the album . They also refer to Morrison and Janet Planet 's life at the time : " We were finally , really living in a dreamland — believe it or not — it was a magical time " , Planet recalled . 
 " I 'll Be Your Lover , Too " was inspired by Morrison and Planet 's marriage . This acoustic ballad has a moderate 4 / 4 tempo , with one 5 / 8 bar before the vocal comes in . " Blue Money " , a pun @-@ filled reference to Morrison 's financial situation , is about a model , perhaps his wife . ( Planet worked in the industry before meeting Morrison . ) " Sweet Jannie " is the second twelve @-@ bar blues on the album ; written about young love , the song is another that reviewers speculated was about Planet . The lyrics , " I 've been in love with you baby / Ever since you were in Sunday school " lead Clinton Heylin to believe it was written about memories from Morrison 's childhood when he attended Sunday school in Belfast ; Planet is a California @-@ raised Texan . 
 In the album closer , " Street Choir " , Morrison repeats the questions , " Why did you let me down / And now that things are better off / Why do you come around " . Because of these lyrics Heylin wrote that " such songs [ as " Street Choir " ] were spawned by an increasing awareness of just how badly ripped off he had been " . Ken Brooks has said that the lyric " Move On Up " is another reference on the album to a Curtis Mayfield song . The track prominently features Keith Johnson 's trumpet and Morrison 's harmonica . Writer Brian Hinton described the lyrics as perversely bitter , while Jon Landau wrote that " Street Choir " was one of the " two or three finest songs " of Morrison 's career because of its " musical and poetic energy " . 
 = = = Packaging = = = 
 Warner Bros. Records scheduled His Band and the Street Choir for rush @-@ release to sell over Christmas 1970 , leaving little time to plan the packaging . These pressured conditions led the company to <unk> the promotional releases as His Band and Street Choir and prepare an incorrectly ordered track listing . At the end of " I 'll Be Your Lover , Too " an unedited conversation is left on the finished record , which Peter Mills notes is an example of the album 's rough edges . Janet Planet designed the album cover and wrote the sleeve notes , which sound " a little desperate " , in the words of Brian Hinton , as she wrote , " This is the album that you must sing with , dance to , you must find a place for these songs somewhere in your life . " 
 David Gahr took the gatefold photos of Morrison surrounded by his musicians with their wives and children at a party for Planet 's son , Peter , born from a previous relationship . Morrison dismissed these photos as " rubbish " . However , Johnny Rogan commented that the front cover looks far worse ; it included a " hilarious " image of Morrison in a full @-@ length kaftan . Morrison complained about the stereotypical front cover as well : " people think you 're a hippie because of the long hair and beard . ... I 'd bought the kaftan in Woodstock , and that 's what people were wearing . " Mills agrees that " Van Morrison was never a hippie , but this was as close as he came . "

 His Band and the Street Choir was first released on LP on 15 November 1970 and was Morrison 's third record to be produced for Warner Bros. It was re @-@ released by the record company on CD in 1987 , 1990 and 2005 , and LP in 2008 with Rhino Records . 
 His Band and the Street Choir peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200 , and at number 18 on the UK Album Chart . The album received a warm reception in North America — as Moondance had done — largely due to the success of " Domino " , a sampler single that peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 . This single remains Morrison 's biggest US hit ( as of 2010 ) , as it climbed one place higher than his 1967 hit " Brown Eyed Girl " , from the album Blowin ' Your Mind ! . " Domino " was also a hit in the Netherlands , reaching number 22 on the Dutch Top 40 . Jon Landau of Rolling Stone magazine attributed the success of " Domino " to the guitar figure at the beginning of the track , which he considered " not only a great way to start a single , but a fine way to begin the album " . " Blue Money " debuted as the second single , faltering outside the Top 20 at number 23 in the US . The final single , " Call Me Up in Dreamland " , managed only two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 , while reaching number 95 ; biographer Ken Brooks believed it deserved better . John Platania recalled that Morrison " had designs " on securing radio airplay for Street Choir , and the success of its singles reflected a growing audience and commercial appeal for his music . 
 On October 30 , 2015 , along with Astral Weeks , the album was remastered and reissued by Warner Bros. Records with five session bonus tracks ; three alternate takes , and two alternate versions of " I 've Been Working " and " I 'll Be Your Lover , Too . " 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Reviewers generally praised Street Choir . Jon Landau compared it to Morrison 's previous work : 
 " His Band and the Street Choir is a free album . It was recorded with minimal over @-@ dubbing and was obviously intended to show the other side of Moondance . And if it has a flaw it is that , like Moondance , it is too much what it set out to be . A few more numbers with a gravity of ' Street Choir ' would have made this album as close to perfect as anyone could have stood . " 
 ZigZag magazine reviewer John Tobler felt , " even if it 's inferior to Moondance , it is still better than eighty per cent of the records you 've got in your collection . " Robert Christgau was more critical , calling it " a less compelling album than Moondance " containing " a few humdrum cuts and an occasional minor lapse of taste " . He nonetheless awarded the album an " A @-@ minus " , later upgraded to an " A " . Biographer Brian Hinton commented that His Band and the Street Choir is " vaguely reminiscent of Bob Dylan 's Nashville Skyline " . Singer @-@ songwriter Elvis Costello identified His Band and the Street Choir as one of his 500 essential albums and " Street Choir " as one of his favorite songs . In 2006 Johnny Rogan called the songs on the album " a severe disappointment when compared to the material on the previous two albums . " 
 = = Morrison and the musicians ' responses = = 
 Van Morrison regarded Street Choir poorly , as he told biographer Ritchie Yorke in 1973 : " Somewhere along the line I lost control of that album . I 'd rather not think about that album because it doesn 't mean much in terms of where I was at ... the album didn 't sell very well and I 'm glad . " Morrison first lost control of the album before its release , when it was retitled from Virgo 's Fool to His Band and the Street Choir : 
 " Somebody else got control of it and got the cover and all that shit while I was on the West Coast . I knew what was happening to it , but it was like I couldn 't stop it . I 'd given my business thing over to someone else and although I had final approval on things , they just went ahead and did the wrong thing . They told the record company it was one thing and it wasn 't . So the whole thing went wrong . " 
 Despite this , assistant producer and drummer Dahaud Shaar recalled that Morrison had positive feelings towards the album at the time of its release . 
 Janet Planet holds the view that " There is much to love about the songs on this album : ' Blue Money ' , ' Crazy Face ' , ' Call Me Up in Dreamland ' , ' Domino ' - these are just great songs in any era . "

 = William de Chesney ( sheriff ) = 
 William de Chesney ( sometimes William of Norwich or William <unk> ; died 1174 ) was a medieval Anglo @-@ Norman nobleman and sheriff . Son of landholder in Norfolk , William inherited after the death of his two elder brothers . He was the founder of Sibton Abbey , as well as a benefactor of other monasteries in England . In 1157 , Chesney acquired the honour of Blythburgh , and was sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk during the 1150s and 1160s . On Chesney 's death in 1174 , he left three unmarried daughters as his heirs . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Chesney was the son of Robert <unk> and Sybil de Chesney , and a younger brother of John de Chesney . Sybil was the daughter of Ralph de Chesney . Robert <unk> was lord of Horsford in Norfolk , which was originally held by Walter de Caen , Robert 's father . The barony was assessed at 10 knight 's fees . 
 Roger was the eldest brother of William , but died childless during their father 's lifetime . The next son , John , inherited the family lands , but died around 1149 without children . William then inherited the lands . John and William had a sister called Margaret , who was the wife of Haimo de St Clair . Their father married a second time , and had a son named Simon by that marriage . William took his surname from his mother 's family , as did his half @-@ brother Simon , who was not related to the Chesney family except by marriage . Two further children of Robert 's , Elias and Peter , are known , but whether they were the children of the first marriage or the second is unclear . Chesney should be distinguished from another William de Chesney , who controlled the town of Oxford and its castle as well as the town of Deddington and its castle in the same time period . 
 = = Career = = 
 Chesney founded Sibton Abbey , and after his brother John 's death he confirmed the foundation of that Cistercian monastery , which was the only Cistercian house in Suffolk . Besides founding that monastery , he also gave lands or other gifts to Colne Priory , Essex , Thetford Priory , Castle Acre Priory , St John 's Abbey , Stoke @-@ by @-@ Clare Priory , and Blythburgh Priory . 
 Chesney acquired the barony of Blythburgh in Suffolk in 1157 . These lands were recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being held by the king , and when Chesney was granted them they were assessed at one knight 's fee in feudal service . Besides Blythburgh , Chesney also acquired lands in Norfolk and Essex which he added to the family lands in Norfolk and Suffolk . 
 In 1153 or 1154 , Chesney was the recipient of the lordship of a hundred and a half in Norfolk , possibly in compensation for the loss of the manor of Mileham . Chesney likely lost Mileham to another noble family , the <unk> , as part of the settlement resulting from the Treaty of Wallingford which settled the civil war in England . Both William 's father Robert and his elder brother John had held these offices before him . 
 Chesney was Sheriff of Norfolk in the late 1140s and the 1150s , being recorded as holding that office in two documents – one dated to between 1146 and 1149 and the other dated to between 1146 and 1153 . The same documents record him as holding the office of Sheriff of Suffolk at concurrent times . He held both offices again between 1156 and 1163 . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Chesney died in 1174 , having had three daughters with his wife Gilla . Her ancestry is unknown , and it is possible that William married another time , to Aubrey de Poynings , because a Lewes Priory charter dated to around 1165 names a William de Chesney and Aubrey his wife , but it is not clear whether this charter is referring to William de Chesney the sheriff or to another William . William and Gilla 's daughters were Margaret , Clemence , and Sara , all of whom were unmarried at the time of their father 's death . Margaret married twice – first to Hugh de Cressy and second to Robert <unk> . Clemence married Jordan de Sackville , and Sara married Richard Engaine . Margaret inherited the majority of her father 's estates . 
 At his death , Chesney had outstanding debts , both to the king and to Jewish moneylenders . In 1214 , his daughter Margaret was exempted from repaying any of her father 's debts to those moneylenders by a royal grant . 
 = Archibald Dixon = 
 Archibald Dixon ( April 2 , 1802 – April 23 , 1876 ) was a U.S. Senator from Kentucky . He represented the Whig Party in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly , and was elected the 12th Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1844 , serving under Governor William Owsley . In 1851 , the Whigs nominated him for governor , but he lost to Lazarus W. Powell , his former law partner . 
 Dixon represented Henderson County at the Kentucky constitutional convention of 1849 . In this capacity , he ensured that strong protections of slave property were included in the Kentucky Constitution of 1850 . Later , the General Assembly chose Dixon to fill the unexpired Senate term of Henry Clay . He served from September 1 , 1852 , to March 3 , 1855 , and did not stand for re @-@ election . During his short tenure , Dixon 's major accomplishment was convincing Stephen Douglas to include language in the Kansas @-@ Nebraska Act that explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise 's prohibition on slavery north of latitude 36 ° 30 ' . 
 Despite his pro @-@ slavery views , Dixon was loyal to the Union during the Civil War . He represented his county and his state in a number of failed conventions that sought to resolve the upcoming conflict before it began . In 1864 , he joined Kentucky governor Thomas E. Bramlette in an audience with President Abraham Lincoln protesting the recruitment of former slaves as Union soldiers in Kentucky . Dixon died on April 23 , 1876 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Archibald Dixon was born near Red House , Caswell County , North Carolina on April 2 , 1802 . He was the son of Captain Wynn and Rebecca Hart Dixon . Both Dixon 's father and grandfather fought in the Revolutionary War , the former enlisting at the age of sixteen . His grandfather , Colonel Henry Dixon , was commended by " Light Horse Harry " Lee for his service at the Battle of Camden . He was later killed at the Battle of Eutaw Springs . 
 In 1805 , Captain Dixon lost all of his property and moved the family to Henderson , Kentucky . Archibald Dixon was educated by his mother and attended the common schools of Henderson . In 1822 , he began to study law in the office of James Hillyer . He was admitted to the bar in 1824 , and commenced practice in Henderson . He became well known as a skilled defense attorney and was employed in a number of cases in Kentucky and Indiana . 
 In 1834 , Dixon married Elizabeth R. Cabell ; the couple had six children . [ a ] One of these was Rebecca Hart Dixon , second wife of future Kentucky governor John Y. Brown . Another daughter , Susan Bell Dixon , married Cuthbert Powell , a U.S. Representative from Virginia . One son , Henry , was elected a state senator in Kentucky , while another , Archibald , became a respected doctor in Henderson . 
 Elizabeth Cabell Dixon died in 1852 . On October 29 , 1853 , Dixon married Susan Peachy Bullitt . Bullitt was the paternal granddaughter of Alexander Scott Bullitt , the first lieutenant governor of Kentucky , and the maternal granddaughter of Dr. Thomas Walker , the first surveyor in the state of Kentucky . Dixon and Bullitt had additional children . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Dixon was elected to represent Henderson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1830 . He served three consecutive one @-@ year terms , leaving the House in 1833 . Following this , he returned to his law practice and in 1835 , partnered with Lazarus W. Powell . From 1836 to 1840 , he represented Henderson , Daviess , and Hopkins counties in the Kentucky Senate . The next year , he returned to the Kentucky House , serving from 1841 to 1843 . 
 In 1844 , Dixon was chosen as the Whig nominee for lieutenant governor on a ticket with William Owsley . Dixon defeated his opponent , William S. Pilcher , by more than 11 @,@ 000 votes . At the expiration of his term , the Whig party considered nominating Dixon for governor , but instead chose the more experienced John J. Crittenden , who defeated Dixon 's former law partner , Lazarus Powell . 
 The voters of Henderson County chose Dixon to represent them at the state constitutional convention of 1849 . The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention , but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie by a vote of 50 to 43 . A large slaveholder , Dixon introduced numerous measures to protect the rights of slaveholders in the new constitution . Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property , that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction , and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic . Though some of these ideas were challenged , all eventually found their way into the Kentucky Constitution of 1850 . 
 The Whigs nominated Dixon for governor in 1851 . The Democrats countered with Lazarus Powell . Still friends from their earlier days as law partners , the two often traveled together during the campaign . Cassius Marcellus Clay also entered the contest , representing the emancipationist wing of the Whig Party . Clay drew about 6 @,@ 000 votes , mostly from Whigs , and Powell won the election by a small majority . 
 = = = In the Senate = = = 
 On December 17 , 1851 , Henry Clay submitted a letter of resignation of his seat in the U.S. Senate , to be effective September 1 of the following year ( 1852 ) . Clay 's announcement came while the Kentucky General Assembly was in session . This was intentional . The majority of the Assembly was Whig , and Clay knew that if he resigned while the Assembly was in session , the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor . By contrast , if he had waited until September 1 to announce his resignation the Assembly would already have closed its session , and Governor Powell , a Democrat , would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later . 
 The Assembly acted according to Clay 's plans . By a vote of 71 – 58 , they chose Dixon over Democrat James Guthrie to assume Clay 's seat effective September 1 . However , Clay died on June 29 , 1852 . Because Dixon 's commission stipulated an effective date of September 1 , Governor Powell proceeded to name Clay 's successor for the period until September 1 . He chose Democrat David Meriwether , who served those two months , then , with respect to the original commission issued by the legislature ( or by simply not returning to the Senate upon the commencement of the next session ) , effectively relinquished the seat to Dixon . After a lengthy Senate debate on the validity of his commission — it having been issued prior to Clay 's death , with an effective date subsequent to the executive appointment of a successor — Dixon was sworn in on December 20 , 1852 . He served the remainder of Clay 's term , but did not stand for reelection in 1854 . 
 A major issue during Dixon 's tenure in the Senate was the admission of the Nebraska Territory to the Union . Specifically , the question hinged upon the issue of whether or not slavery would be allowed in the state . Under the Missouri Compromise , slavery was prohibited in the territory . Because of this , the southern states opposed its admission . In an attempt to allay southern fears , Stephen Douglas introduced a bill in January 1854 that included a provision that " all questions pertaining to slavery in the territories , and in the new states to be formed therefrom are to be left to the people residing therein , through their appropriate representatives . " Douglas hoped to placate southerners with this language , which allowed for the possibility of legalized slavery in the potential state without specifically addressing the issue of the Missouri Compromise . 
 Southerners , however , saw that Douglas ' attempt was unlikely to result in legalization of slavery . While it allowed Nebraska to determine whether slavery would be legal there when it became a state , slavery was still forbidden under the Missouri Compromise as long as it remained a territory . If no slaveholders were allowed in the territory , it would be exceedingly unlikely that the state 's voters would allow for slavery in their constitution . Following this line of thought , Dixon drafted an amendment to Douglas ' bill that would repeal section eight of the Missouri Compromise , the section that prohibited slavery north of latitude 36 ° 30 ' . After a promise of support from Tennessee senator James C. Jones , Dixon introduced the amendment on January 16 , 1854 . This forced Douglas to confront the Missouri Compromise issue outright , and two days later , he visited Dixon to discuss his position . Douglas was reluctant to repeal the Compromise , but was ultimately convinced by Dixon 's logic . He concluded the interview by exclaiming " By God , Sir , you are right . I will incorporate it in my bill , though I know it will raise a hell of a storm . " Over the next several days , Douglas incorporated Dixon 's suggestion and other pro @-@ slavery measures into the Kansas @-@ Nebraska Act , which President Franklin Pierce signed into law on May 30 , 1854 .

 On June 1 , 1852 , the stockholders of the Henderson and Nashville Railroad met at Madisonville , Kentucky and elected Archibald Dixon as president of the company . He served until his resignation in spring 1853 . 
 Despite his pro @-@ slavery views , Dixon loyally supported the Union during the lead @-@ up to the Civil War . His sons , however , had Confederate sympathies . Dixon 's home county of Henderson was one of the first counties in Kentucky to express their feelings about the secession crisis . The county called an assembly at the county courthouse on November 10 , 1860 . Dixon was elected chair of the meeting , and immediately expressed a pro @-@ Union sentiment . A committee of five was appointed to draft resolutions stating Henderson County 's position . At a second meeting one week later – which Dixon also chaired – the committee reported their pro @-@ Union resolutions , which were approved . 
 In an attempt to stave off the Civil War , Dixon participated in a convention of border states and a peace convention in Frankfort , Kentucky , both in 1861 . Both conventions were unsuccessful . At the outset of the war , the Kentucky General Assembly elected six arbiters to recommend a course of action for the Commonwealth . Dixon represented the pro @-@ Union position along with John J. Crittenden and Samuel S. Nicholas . Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin , John C. Breckinridge , and Richard Hawes represented the southern sympathizers . The arbiters met on May 11 , 1861 . After the pro @-@ Union men defeated a proposal to call a sovereignty convention , the six arbiters recommended a position of neutrality , which the General Assembly adopted . 
 In March 1864 , Dixon accompanied Kentucky Governor Thomas E. Bramlette and John Marshall Harlan , the state 's attorney general , to an audience with President Lincoln to protest the recruitment of blacks into the ranks of the Union Army . The governor eventually agreed to allow the practice , but only when whites failed to meet their draft quotas . Since recruitment of blacks had been taking place in the Commonwealth for more than two months already , the concession was little more than a face @-@ saving gesture by Bramlette . Following the end of the Civil War , Dixon retired from public life . He died in Henderson on April 23 , 1876 , and is buried in Fernwood Cemetery .

 = Colorado State Highway 112 = 
 State Highway 112 ( SH 112 ) is a 27 @.@ 802 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 44 @.@ 743 km ) state highway in southern Colorado . Built in 1916 and formally defined in 1922 , the route begins at its western end in Del Norte at a junction with U.S. Highway 160 ( US 160 ) . From there the road travels east crossing US 285 two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of Center before reaching its eastern terminus at Hooper where it meets SH 17 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The route begins at US 160 in central Del Norte . Here , it begins northward along Oak Street before crossing the Rio Grande , where the route exits the city and curves northeastward . The highway then straddles the Rio Grande – Saguache county line as it travels in a northeasterly direction . Soon , it intersects County Route 374 , which traverses east all the way to US 285 . The route then suddenly curves eastward when it meets Twelve Mile Road . As the route continues to meet numerous county roads along its length , the land along the side of the road transitions from plain grassland to circular @-@ shaped fields of crops . The route meets US 285 approximately twelve miles east of Del Norte . 
 East of US 285 , the route enters the town of Center , where it skirts the south side of town as 8th Street . Here , it meets a railroad that connects the town to Sugar Junction farther south . The route moves east through farmland , where it meets County Road 100 , which continues south to SH 15 . It then skirts along the county line all the way east to SH 17 at the north side of Hooper . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1916 , a 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) gravel road numbered as 10 @-@ S ran from Center to Hooper . Another unsurfaced part of the road continued to Alamosa from Hooper . By the late 1910s , the Highway Department of Colorado had built State Highway 68 , which ran from Del Norte to SH 36 . When built , the route had a five @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) gap along the Rio Grande – Saguache county line , on which work began in the 1920s . In 1922 , SH 68 was renumbered as SH 112 from Del Norte to Hooper . 
 By 1930 , SH 112 had been paved from Del Norte to the county line . Because the residents of San Luis Valley sought better roads , the Department of Highways began improving SH 112 around the area , but the highway was not fully surfaced until 1946 . The next year , Rio Grande and Saguache counties paid to resurface the rest of the road in asphalt . Since 1947 , there have been no major realignments in the routing .

 By contrast , Sputnikmusic 's staff reviewer Channing Freeman was highly critical of the album , giving it a one and a half out of five as well as calling it , " fucking foolishness " . Freeman criticized the exclusion of J.

 = Panzer I = 
 The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s . The name is short for the German Panzerkampfwagen I ( " armored fighting vehicle mark I " ) , abbreviated PzKpfw I. The tank 's official German ordnance inventory designation was SdKfz 101 ( " special purpose vehicle 101 " ) . 
 Design of the Panzer I began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934 . Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armored warfare to the German Army , the Panzer I saw combat in Spain during the Spanish Civil War , in Poland , France , the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War , and in China during the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . Experiences with the Panzer I during the Spanish Civil War helped shape the German armored corps ' invasion of Poland in 1939 and France in 1940 . By 1941 , the Panzer I chassis design was used as the basis of tank destroyers and assault guns . There were attempts to upgrade the Panzer I throughout its service history , including by foreign nations , to extend the design 's lifespan . It continued to serve in the Spanish Armed Forces until 1954 . 
 The Panzer I 's performance in combat was limited by its thin armor and light armament of two machine guns . As a design intended for training , the Panzer I was not as capable as other light tanks of the era , such as the Soviet T @-@ 26 . Although weak in combat , it formed a large part of Germany 's tank forces and was used in all major campaigns between September 1939 and December 1941 . The small , vulnerable light tank would be surpassed in importance by other German tanks , such as the Panzer IV , Panther , and Tiger ; nevertheless , the Panzer I 's contribution to the early victories of Nazi Germany during World War II was significant . Later in that war the turrets of the then obsolete PzKpfw Is and PzKpfw IIs were repurposed as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers , particularly on the Atlantic Wall . 
 = = Development history = = 
 The post @-@ World War I Treaty of Versailles of 1919 prohibited the design , manufacture and deployment of tanks within the Reichswehr . Paragraph Twenty @-@ four of the treaty provided for a 100 @,@ 000 @-@ mark fine and imprisonment of up to six months for anybody who " [ manufactured ] armoured vehicles , tanks or similar machines , which may be turned to military use " . 
 Despite the manpower and technical limitations imposed on the German Army by the Treaty of Versailles , several Reichswehr officers established a clandestine General Staff to study World War I and develop future strategies and tactics . Although at first the concept of the tank as a mobile weapon of war met with apathy , German industry was silently encouraged to look into tank design , while quiet cooperation was undertaken with the Soviet Union . There was also minor military cooperation with Sweden , including the extraction of technical data that proved invaluable to early German tank design . As early as 1926 various German companies , including Rheinmetall and Daimler @-@ Benz , produced a single prototype armed with a large 75 @-@ millimeter cannon ( the <unk> , " large tractor " , was so codenamed to veil the true purpose of the vehicle ) . Only two years later , German companies produced prototypes of the new <unk> ( " light tractor " ) , which were armed with 37 @-@ millimeter KwK L / 45 guns . The <unk> was later put into service for a brief period with the 1 Panzer Division ; the <unk> remained in testing until 1935 . 
 In the late 1920s and early 1930s , German tank theory was pioneered by two figures : General Oswald Lutz and his chief of staff , Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Guderian . Guderian became the more influential of the two and his ideas were widely publicized . Like his contemporary Sir Percy Hobart , Guderian initially envisioned an armored corps ( <unk> ) composed of several types of tanks . This included a slow infantry tank , armed with a small @-@ caliber cannon and several machine guns . The infantry tank , according to Guderian , was to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti @-@ tank guns and artillery . He also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank , similar to the British cruiser tank , which was to be armored against enemy anti @-@ tank weapons and have a large 75 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 95 in ) main gun . Lastly , Germany would need a heavy tank , armed with a massive 150 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) cannon to defeat enemy fortifications , and even stronger armor . Such a tank would require a weight of 70 to 100 tonnes and was completely impractical given the manufacturing capabilities of the day . 
 Soon after rising to power in Germany , Adolf Hitler approved the creation of Germany 's first panzer divisions . <unk> his earlier proposal , Guderian suggested the design of a main combat vehicle , which would be developed into the Panzer III , and a breakthrough tank , the Panzer IV . No existing design appealed to Guderian . As a stopgap , the German Army ordered a preliminary vehicle to train German tank crews . This became the Panzer I. 
 The Panzer I 's design history can be traced to 1932 's <unk> Schlepper ( La S ) ( Agricultural Tractor ) armored fighting vehicle . The La S was intended not just to train Germany 's panzer troops , but to prepare Germany 's industry for the mass production of tanks in the near future ; a difficult engineering feat for the time . In July 1932 , Krupp revealed a prototype of the <unk> Krupp A , or LKA , with a sloped front glacis plate and large central casemate , a design heavily influenced by the British Carden Loyd tankette . The tank was armed with two obsolescent 7 @.@ 92 @-@ millimeter ( .312 in ) MG @-@ 13 Dreyse machine guns . Machine guns were known to be largely useless against even the lightest tank armor of the time , restricting the Panzer I to a training and anti @-@ infantry role by design . 
 A mass @-@ produced version of the LKA was designed by a collaborative team from Daimler @-@ Benz , Henschel , Krupp , MAN , and Rheinmetall , exchanging the casemate for a rotating turret . This version was accepted into service after testing in 1934 . Although these tanks were referred to as the La S and LKA well beyond the start of production , its official designation , assigned in 1938 , was Panzerkampfwagen I <unk> . A ( ' model A ' or , more accurately , ' batch A ' ) . The first 15 tanks , produced between February and March 1934 , did not include the rotating turret and were used for crew training . Following these , production was switched to the combat version of the tank . The Ausf . A was under @-@ armored , with steel plate of only 13 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 51 in ) at its thickest . The tank had several design flaws , including suspension problems , which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities , and engine overheating . The driver was positioned inside the chassis and used conventional steering levers to control the tank , while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as gunner . The two crewmen could communicate by means of a voice tube . Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins , containing various numbers of 25 @-@ round magazines . Author Lucas Molina Franco suggests that 833 Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf . A tanks were built in total , while authors Bryan Perrett offers the number of 300 and Terry Gander 818 units . 
 Many of the problems in the Ausf . A were corrected with the introduction of the Ausf . B. The engine was replaced by the water @-@ cooled , six @-@ cylinder Maybach NL 38 TR , developing 98 horsepower ( 73 kW ) , and the gearbox was changed to a more reliable model . The larger engine required the extension of the vehicle 's chassis by 40 cm ( 16 in ) , and this allowed the improvement of the tank 's suspension , adding another bogie wheel and raising the tensioner . The tank 's weight increased by 0 @.@ 4 tons . Production of the Ausf . B began in August 1935 and finished in early 1937 — Franco writes 840 were constructed , but notes that only 675 of these were combat models , while Perrett suggests a total number of 1 @,@ 500 ( offsetting the low number of Ausf . A he proposes ) and Gander a total of 675 . 
 = = = Sister tanks = = = 
 Two more combat versions of the Panzer I were designed and produced between 1939 and 1942 . By this stage , the design concept had been superseded by medium and heavy tanks and neither variant was produced in sufficient numbers to have a real impact on the progress of the war . These new tanks had nothing in common with either the Ausf . A or B except name . One of these , the Panzer I Ausf . C , was designed jointly between Krauss @-@ Maffei and Daimler @-@ Benz in 1939 to provide an amply armored and armed reconnaissance light tank . The Ausf . C boasted a completely new chassis and turret , a modern torsion @-@ bar suspension and five Schachtellaufwerk @-@ style interleaved roadwheels . It also had a maximum armor thickness of 30 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 18 in ) , over twice that of either the Ausf . A or B , and was armed with an EW 141 semi autocannon , with a 50 round drum , firing <unk> anti @-@ tank shells . Forty of these tanks were produced , along with six prototypes . Two tanks were deployed to 1st Panzer Division in 1943 , and the other thirty @-@ eight were deployed to the LVIII Panzer Reserve Corps during the Normandy landings . 
 The second vehicle , the Ausf . F , was as different from the Ausf . C as it was from the Ausf . A and B. Intended as an infantry support tank , the Panzer I Ausf . F had a maximum armour thickness of 80 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 15 in ) and weighed between 18 and 21 tonnes . The Ausf . F was armed with two 7 @.@ 92 @-@ millimeter MG @-@ 34s . Thirty were produced in 1940 , and a second order of 100 was later canceled . In order to compensate for the increased weight , a new 150 horsepower ( 110 kW ) Maybach <unk> Otto engine was used , allowing a maximum road speed of 25 kilometers per hour ( 15 @.@ 5 mph ) and used five overlapping road wheels per side , dropping the Ausf . C 's interleaved units . Eight of the thirty tanks produced were sent to the 1st Panzer Division in 1943 and saw combat at the Battle of Kursk . The rest were given to several army schools for training and evaluation purposes .

 On 18 July 1936 , war broke out on the Iberian peninsula as Spain dissolved into a state of civil war . After the chaos of the initial uprising , two sides coalesced and began to consolidate their position — the Popular front ( the Republicans ) and the Spanish Nationalist front . In an early example of a proxy war , both sides quickly received support from other countries , most notably the Soviet Union and Germany , who wanted to test their tactics and equipment . The first shipment of foreign tanks , 50 Soviet T @-@ 26s , arrived on 15 October . The shipment was under the surveillance of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine and Germany immediately responded by sending 41 Panzer I 's to Spain a few days later . This first shipment was followed by four more shipments of Panzer I Ausf . B 's , with a total of 122 vehicles . 
 The first shipment of Panzer I 's was brought under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma in Gruppe Thoma ( also referred to as Panzergruppe <unk> ) . Gruppe Thoma formed part of Gruppe <unk> , the ground formations of the German Condor Legion , who fought on the side of Franco 's Nationalists . Between July and October , a rapid Nationalist advance from Seville to Toledo placed them in position to take the Spanish capital , Madrid . The Nationalist advance and the fall of the town of Illescas to Nationalist armies on 18 October 1936 caused the government of the Popular Front 's Second Republic , including President Manuel Azaña , to flee to Barcelona and Valencia . In an attempt to stem the Nationalist tide and gain crucial time for Madrid 's defence , Soviet armor was deployed south of the city under the command of Colonel Krivoshein before the end of October . At this time , several T @-@ 26 tanks under the command of Captain Paul Arman were thrown into a Republican counterattack directed towards the town of <unk> de Velasco in an attempt to cut off the Nationalist advance north . This was the first tank battle in the Spanish Civil War . Despite initial success , poor communication between the Soviet Republican armor and Spanish Republican infantry caused the isolation of Captain Arman 's force and the subsequent destruction of a number of tanks . This battle also marked the first use of the molotov cocktail against tanks . Ritter von Thoma 's Panzer Is fought for the Nationalists only days later on 30 October , and immediately experienced problems . As the Nationalist armor advanced , it was engaged by the Commune de Paris battalion , equipped with Soviet BA @-@ 10 armored cars . The 45 @-@ millimeter gun in the BA @-@ 10 was more than sufficient to knock out the poorly armored Panzer I at ranges below 500 meters ( 550 yd ) . 
 Although the Panzer I would participate in almost every major Nationalist offensive of the war , the Nationalist army began to deploy more and more captured T @-@ 26 tanks to offset their disadvantage in protection and firepower . At one point , von Thoma offered up to 500 pesetas for each T @-@ 26 captured . Although the Panzer I was initially able to knock out the T @-@ 26 at close range — 150 meters ( 165 yd ) or less — using an armor @-@ piercing 7 @.@ 92 millimeter bullet , the Republican tanks began to engage at ranges where they were immune to the machine guns of the Panzer I. 
 The Panzer I was upgraded in order to increase its lethality . On 8 August 1937 , Major General García <unk> received a note from Generalísimo Francisco Franco that expressed the need for a Panzer I ( or <unk> , as their Spanish crews called them ) with a 20 @-@ millimeter gun . Ultimately , the piece chosen was the Breda Model 1935 , due to the simplicity of the design over competitors such as the German Flak 30 . Furthermore , the 20 mm Breda was capable of <unk> 40 millimeters of armor at 250 meters ( 1 @.@ 57 in at 275 yd ) , which was more than sufficient to penetrate the frontal armor of the T @-@ 26 . Although originally 40 Italian <unk> light tanks were ordered with the Breda in place of their original armament , this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same gun to the Panzer I would yield better results . Prototypes were ready by September 1937 and an order was placed after successful results . The mounting of the Breda in the Panzer I required the original turret to be opened at the top and then extended by a vertical supplement . Four of these tanks were finished at the Armament Factory of Seville , but further production was canceled as it was decided sufficient numbers of Republican T @-@ 26 tanks had been captured to fulfill the Nationalist leadership 's request for more lethal tanks . The Breda modification was not particularly liked by German crews , as the unprotected gap in the turret , designed to allow the tank 's commander to aim , was found to be a dangerous weak point . 
 In late 1938 , another Panzer I was sent to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45 mm gun , captured from a Soviet tank ( a T @-@ 26 or BT @-@ 5 ) . A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37 @-@ millimeter <unk> anti @-@ tank gun , which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. <unk> . It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed , although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board .

 In 1937 , around ten Ausf . As were sold to China during a period of Sino @-@ German cooperation until 1941 , which were used in the Battle of Nanjing by the 3rd Armored Battalion of the Chinese Nationalist Army to fight against the Japanese Imperial Army . 
 After the fall of Nanking , the Chinese Panzer I <unk> were captured by the Japanese and displayed at the Yasukuni Shrine . Because of the relationship between Germany and Japan , the Chinese Panzer I <unk> were labelled " Made in the USSR " . 
 = = = World War II in Europe = = = 
 During the initial campaigns of World War II , Germany 's light tanks , including the Panzer I , formed the bulk of its armored strength . In March 1938 , the German Army marched into Austria , experiencing a mechanical breakdown rate of up to thirty percent . However , the experience revealed to Guderian several faults within the German Panzerkorps and he subsequently improved logistical support . In October 1938 , Germany occupied Czechoslovakia 's Sudetenland , and the remainder of the country in March 1939 . The capture of Czechoslovakia allowed several Czech tank designs , such as the Panzer 38 ( t ) , and their subsequent variants and production , to be incorporated into the German Army 's strength . It also prepared German forces for the invasion of Poland . 
 = = = = Poland and the campaign in the west = = = = 
 On 1 September 1939 , Germany invaded Poland using seventy @-@ two divisions ( including 16 reserve infantry divisions in OKH reserves ) , including seven panzer divisions ( 1 . , 2 . , 3 . , 4 . , 5 . , 10 . , " Kempf " ) and four light divisions ( 1 . , 2 . , 3 . , 4 . ) . Three days later , France and Britain declared war on Germany . The seven panzer and four light divisions were arrayed in five armies , forming two army groups . The battalion strength of the 1st Panzer Division included no less than fourteen Panzer Is , while the other six divisions included thirty @-@ four . A total of about 2 @,@ 700 tanks were available for the invasion of Poland , but only 310 of the heavier Panzer III and IV tanks were available . Furthermore , 350 were of Czech design — the rest were either Panzer Is or Panzer IIs . The invasion was swift and the last Polish pockets of resistance surrendered on 6 October . The entire campaign had lasted five weeks ( with help of the Soviet forces , which attacked on 17 September ) , and the success of Germany 's tanks in the campaign was summed up in response to Hitler on 5 September : when asked if it had been the dive bombers who destroyed a Polish artillery regiment , Guderian replied , " No , our panzers ! " 
 Some 832 German tanks ( including 320 <unk> , 259 <unk> , 40 <unk> III , 76 <unk> , 77 <unk> ( t ) , 13 PzBef III , 7 PzBef 38 ( t ) , 34 other PzBef and some <unk> ( t ) ) were lost during the campaign , approximately 341 of which were never to return to service . This represented about a third of Germany 's armor deployed for the Polish campaign . During the campaign , no less than half of Germany 's tanks were unavailable due to maintenance issues or enemy action , and of all tanks , the Panzer I proved the most vulnerable to Polish anti @-@ tank weapons . 
 Furthermore , it was found that the handling of armored forces during the campaign left much to be desired . During the beginning of Guderian 's attack in northern Poland , his corps was held back to coordinate with infantry for quite a while , preventing a faster advance . It was only after Army Group South had its attention taken from Warsaw at the Battle of Bzura that Guderian 's armor was fully unleashed . There were still lingering tendencies to reserve Germany 's armor , even if in independent divisions , to cover an infantry advance or the flanks of advancing infantry armies . Although tank production was increased to 125 tanks per month after the Polish Campaign , losses forced the Germans to draw further strength from Czech tank designs , and light tanks continued to form the majority of Germany 's armored strength . 
 Months later , Panzer Is participated in Operation Weserübung — the invasion of Denmark and Norway . 
 Despite its obsolescence , the Panzer I was also used in the invasion of France in May 1940 . Of 2 @,@ 574 tanks available for the campaign , no fewer than 523 were Panzer Is , while there were 627 Panzer IIIs and IVs , 955 Panzer II , 106 Czech Panzer 35 ( t ) , and 228 Panzer 38 ( t ) . For their defense , the French boasted up to 4 @,@ 000 tanks , including 300 Char B1 , armed with a 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 7 in ) gun in the turret and a larger 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 95 in ) low @-@ velocity gun in the hull . The French also had around 250 Somua S @-@ 35 , widely regarded as one of the best tanks of the period , armed with the same 47 mm main gun and protected by almost 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 17 in ) of armor at its thickest point . Nevertheless , the French also deployed over 3 @,@ 000 light tanks , including about 500 World War I @-@ vintage FT @-@ 17s . The two main advantages that German armor enjoyed were radios allowing them to coordinate faster than their British or French counterparts , and superior tactical doctrine , in addition to markedly faster speed , generally . 
 = = = = North Africa and campaigns in the east = = = = 
 Italian setbacks in Egypt and their colony of Libya caused Hitler to dispatch aircraft to Sicily , and a blocking force to North Africa . This blocking force was put under the command of Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel and included the motorized 5th Light Division and the 15th Panzer Division . This force landed at Tunis on 12 February 1941 . Upon arrival , Rommel had around 150 tanks , about half Panzer III and IV . The rest were Panzer I 's and IIs , although the Panzer I was soon replaced . On 6 April 1941 , Germany attacked both Yugoslavia and Greece , with fourteen divisions invading Greece from neighboring Bulgaria , which by then had joined the Tripartite Pact . The invasion of Yugoslavia included no less than six panzer divisions , which still fielded the Panzer I. Yugoslavia surrendered 17 April 1941 , and Greece fell on 30 April 1941 . 
 The final major campaign in which the Panzer I formed a large portion of the armored strength was Operation Barbarossa , 22 June 1941 . The 3 @,@ 300 German tanks included about 410 Panzer I 's . By the end of the month , a large portion of the Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket , and by 21 September Kiev had fallen , thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective , Moscow . Despite the success of Germany 's armor in the Soviet Union , between June and September most German officers were shocked to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models , the T @-@ 34 and KV series . Army Group North quickly realized that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could penetrate the thick armor of the KV @-@ 1 . The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the Panzer I was not suitable for this front . Some less battle @-@ worthy Panzer Is were tasked with towing lorries through mud to alleviate logistics problems at the front . 
 = = = Others = = = 
 After Germany , Spain fielded the largest number of Panzer I tanks . A total of 122 were exported to Spain during the Spanish Civil War , and , as late as 1945 , Spain 's Brunete Armored Division fielded 93 . The Panzer I remained in use in Spain until aid arrived from the United States in 1954 when they were replaced by the relatively modern M47 Patton . Between 1935 and 1936 , an export version of the Panzer I Ausf . B , named the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> B ) , was designed for export to Bulgaria . Modifications included up @-@ gunning to a 20 @-@ millimeter gun and fitting a Krupp M 311 V @-@ 8 gasoline engine . Although three examples were built , none were exported to Bulgaria , although a single Panzer I Ausf . A had previously been sold . 
 A final order was supplied to Hungary in 1942 , totalling eight Ausf . B 's and six command versions . These were incorporated into the 1st Armored Division and saw combat in late 1942 . 
 = = Variants = = 
 Between 1934 and the mid @-@ 1940s , several variants of the Panzer I were designed , especially during the later years of its combat history . Because they were obsolescent from their introduction , incapable of defeating foreign armor , and outclassed by newer German tanks , the Panzer I chassis were increasingly adapted as tank destroyers and other variants . One of the best @-@ known variants was the <unk> Panzerbefehlswagen ( " small armored command vehicle " ) , built on the Ausf . A and Ausf . B chassis — 200 of these were manufactured . The Panzer I Ausf . B chassis was also used to build the German Army 's first tracked tank destroyer , the Panzerjäger I. This vehicle was armed with a Czech 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 85 in ) anti @-@ tank gun .

 Clarence Smith Jeffries , VC ( 26 October 1894 – 12 October 1917 ) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest decoration for gallantry " in the face of the enemy " that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces . He was posthumously decorated with the Victoria Cross following his actions in the First Battle of Passchendaele during the First World War , in which he led several parties of men in an attack that eventuated in the capture of six machine guns and sixty @-@ five prisoners , before being killed himself by machine gun fire . 
 Born in a suburb of Newcastle , New South Wales , Jeffries was employed as a surveyor at a mining company where his father served as general manager following his completion of school . Joining a militia battalion in 1912 , he was commissioned as a second lieutenant upon the outbreak of war and tasked with the instruction of volunteers for the newly raised Australian Imperial Force . Transferring into the Australian Imperial Force himself in 1916 , Jeffries embarked with his battalion for service on the Western Front . Wounded at Messines , he was promoted to captain before being killed fourteen days short of his twenty @-@ third birthday .

 Jeffries was born in the Newcastle suburb of Wallsend , New South Wales , on 26 October 1894 . He was the only child of Joshua Jeffries , a colliery manager , and his wife Barbara , née Steel . Jeffries attended Dudley Primary School before moving onto Newcastle Collegiate and High schools . Apprenticed as a mining surveyor at the Abermain Collieries on the state 's northern coalfields , where his father was general manager , Jeffries was noted as a cricketer and a keen horseman who took a particular interest in breeding thoroughbreds . In July 1912 , Jeffries joined the 14th ( Hunter River ) Infantry Regiment , Citizens Military Force , as a private under the compulsory training scheme . He was promoted to sergeant a year later . 
 = = First World War = = 
 Following the outbreak of the First World War , Jeffries was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force on 22 August 1914 . By this time he was in charge of the survey department at the Abermain Collieries , but was mobilised for home defence duties and the instruction of volunteers for the newly raised Australian Imperial Force at Newcastle and Liverpool camps . Promoted lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force in July 1915 , he transferred to the Australian Imperial Force on 1 February 1916 with the substantive rank of second lieutenant , and was placed in command of C Company of the 34th Battalion . In May , the battalion embarked from Sydney for the United Kingdom , with Jeffries aboard HMAT Hororata . Arriving in late June , the battalion spent the next five months training in England , during which time Jeffries was promoted to lieutenant . 
 In late November 1916 , the 34th Battalion was shipped to France for service on the Western Front . Initially posted to the Armentières sector in Belgium , the battalion did not participate in its first major battle until June 1917 , when it took part in the Battle of Messines after the British and Dominion operations switched to the Ypres sector of Belgium . During the engagement , Jeffries received a bullet wound to the thigh while leading a reconnaissance patrol and was evacuated to the 3rd General Hospital in London . While recuperating , he was promoted to captain on 26 June , before rejoining his battalion in September as a company commander .

 On 12 October 1917 , the 34th Battalion — as a member of the 9th Brigade — was to take part in the 3rd Australian Division 's attack on Passchendaele , Belgium . Subject to several days of heavy rain , the battlefield had been transformed into a boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence . Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack , which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting , as many of the direction tapes leading to the starting position had been destroyed or swallowed up by the mud . To avoid any mishaps , Jeffries and another of the battalion 's company commanders , Captain T.G. Gilder , pushed on alone as far as <unk> cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack . Thus , by 03 : 00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack . 
 At the designated time of 05 : 25 , the British opened up with an artillery barrage on the German positions just as the Australian forces entered no man 's land for the attack . Heavy machine gun fire assaulted the troops from all directions as they bunched together on the firmer ground to avoid sinking in the boggy mud . Serious resistance was encountered at <unk> Farm , a strong point to the east of Augustus Wood in the centre of the highest part of the Passchendaele ridge . The position consisted of two pillboxes , supported by fifty metres of trench that was occupied by approximately thirty men with four machine guns . The fire from these machine guns forced the men of the 34th Battalion to seek cover on the exposed crest and threatened to halt the entire advance . 
 Jeffries , realising his force was suffering heavy casualties , quickly organised a bombing party of fourteen men and set about outflanking the pillboxes . Accompanying Jeffries was Sergeant James Bruce , a 39 @-@ year @-@ old Scottish @-@ born miner who had worked for Jeffries ' father at the Abermain Collieries . According to popular legend , Bruce had promised to look out for his boss 's son , and remained at Jeffries ' side throughout the attack . Working around the position , the party attacked the emplacement from the rear , capturing four machine guns and thirty @-@ five prisoners ; thus reviving the advance . Jeffries then led his company forward under heavy artillery and machine gun fire to reach their first objective . 
 Despite the heavy losses which left gaping holes in the Allied line , it was decided that the next stage of the advance was to go ahead . At 08 : 25 , parties from the 34th and 35th Battalions headed out along the south @-@ eastern edge of the ridge towards the outskirts of Passchendaele . Almost immediately , they came under heavy fire from a pillbox close by a railway embankment , at which time Major J.B. Buchanan , the senior brigade officer with the advance party , fell dead , leaving Jeffries to assume control . Gathering a party of eleven men , he set about silencing the machine gun position . <unk> across the open ground , the party attacked the position from the west just as the machine gun was firing to the north . Realising that an attack was imminent , the machine gunner switched around , mortally wounding Jeffries in the stomach and sending the rest of the party to ground . When its fire eased , the remaining members of the group worked around the position , rushed it and seized two machine guns in conjunction with thirty prisoners . 
 With the second objective only partially captured , the remnants of the 9th Brigade , battered by artillery and machine gun fire , were forced to relinquish their position and retreat back to their own lines . All that remained on the Passchendaele ridge of the 9th Brigade was the dead and wounded , among whom was Clarence Jeffries , who was later counted among those with no known grave .

 For his actions during the battle at Passchendaele , Jeffries was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross , the notification of which was published in the London Gazette on 18 December 1917 . His citation read : 
 War Office , 18th December , 1917 
 His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers , Noncommissioned Officers and Man : — 
 Capt. Clarence Smith Jeffries , late Australian Imperial Force . 
 For most conspicuous bravery in attack , when his company was held up by enemy machine @-@ gun fire from concrete emplacements . Organising a party , he rushed one emplacement , capturing four machine guns and thirty @-@ five prisoners . He then led his company forward under extremely heavy enemy artillery barrage and enfilade machine @-@ gun fire to the objective . 
 Later , he again organised a successful attack on a machine @-@ gun emplacement , capturing two machine guns and thirty more prisoners . 
 This gallant officer was killed during the attack , but it was entirely due to his bravery and initiative that the centre of the attack was not held up for a lengthy period . His example had a most inspiring influence . 
 Severely affected by the unknown fate of his son 's body , Joshua Jeffries set out for Belgium in 1920 in an attempt to discover his son 's " lost grave " . He returned to Australia disappointed , only to learn in January 1921 that Clarence 's body had been exhumed from a battlefield grave on 14 September 1920 , and re @-@ buried in Tyne Cot Cemetery , Plot XL , Row E , Grave 1 . The body had been identified by a set of captain 's pips , Australian numerals and the penciled initials " <unk> " found on the ground sheet in which the body was wrapped . Three years later , Joshua Jeffries returned to Belgium once again ; this time to pay his last respects to his son . As a debt of gratitude to the late Lieutenant James Bruce MC , DCM , who as a sergeant had assisted Clarence at Passchendaele before being killed himself on 17 July 1918 , Joshua employed Bruce 's two eldest sons as trainee mining surveyors at the Abermain Collieries . 
 Following a campaign by the citizens of Abermain , the Capt. Clarence Smith Jeffries Memorial Park was established in 1947 , and upon Barbara Jeffries death in 1964 , she bequeathed her son 's medals to the Warriors Chapel at Christchurch Cathedral , Newcastle , where they are currently on display . Jeffries is also commemorated by photographic portraits in the Abermain Memorial and Citizens ' Club and by a carved chair presented to Abermain Holy Trinity Anglican Church by his uncle and aunt in 1918 . In 1976 , the Jeffries and Currey Memorial Library was opened by the Governor of New South Wales , Sir Roden Cutler , at Dudley Public School to honour two of the school 's pupils who were decorated with the Victoria Cross during the First World War : Clarence Jeffries and William Currey . The pair are also commemorated by the Capt. Clarence Smith Jeffries ( V.C. ) and Pte . William Matthew Currey ( V.C. ) Memorial Wall located in the grounds of Sandgate General Cemetery , Newcastle , which was unveiled in an official ceremony on 16 April 2000 . The Clarence Jeffries Housing Estate at Bullecourt Army Barracks in Adamstown is also named in his honour .

 The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask ( Japanese : ゼルダの伝説 <unk> , Hepburn : Zeruda no Densetsu : <unk> no Kamen ) is an action @-@ adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 . It was released in Japan on April 27 , 2000 , in North America on October 26 , 2000 , and in Europe on November 17 , 2000 . Approximately 314 @,@ 000 copies of the game were sold during its first week in Japan , and three million copies were sold worldwide . The game was rereleased for the GameCube as part of The Legend of Zelda : Collector 's Edition in 2003 , and the Wii 's Virtual Console service in 2009 . It was released for the European Wii U Virtual Console on June 23 , 2016 . An enhanced remake for the Nintendo 3DS , titled The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask 3D , was released in February 2015 . 
 Majora 's Mask is the sixth main installment in The Legend of Zelda series and the second using 3D graphics , the first being the game 's predecessor , The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time . Considered by critics to be a " darker " entry in the Zelda games franchise , Majora 's Mask is set in Termina , an alternate version of the usual series setting of Hyrule , where the Skull Kid has stolen Majora 's Mask , a powerful ancient artifact . Under its influence , the Skull Kid causes the land 's moon to slowly fall towards Termina , where it crashes after three days . The protagonist Link repeatedly travels back in time to the beginning of the three days to find a way to stop the moon from destroying the world . 
 The gameplay is centered on the perpetually repeating three @-@ day cycle and the use of various masks , some of which allow Link to transform into different beings . Link learns to play several melodies on his ocarina , which have a variety of effects like controlling the flow of time or opening passages to four temples , which house challenges Link must overcome . Unlike Ocarina of Time , Majora 's Mask requires the Expansion Pak , which provides additional memory for enhanced graphics and more on @-@ screen characters . Majora 's Mask was acclaimed by critics , who praised the graphics and complex story . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay of Majora 's Mask expands on that of Ocarina of Time ; it retains the concept of dungeon puzzles and ocarina songs , and introduces character transformations and a three @-@ day cycle . As in previous installments , Link can perform basic actions such as walking , running and limited jumping , and must use items to battle enemies and solve puzzles . Link 's main weapon is the sword , which can be upgraded throughout the game . Other weapons and items are available — Link can block or reflect attacks with a shield , stun enemies by throwing Deku Nuts , attack from a distance with a bow and arrows , destroy obstacles and damage enemies with bombs . He can also latch onto objects or paralyze enemies with the <unk> . Magic power allows attacks such as magical arrows or spin attacks , and the use of special items . 
 = = = Masks and transformations = = = 
 While the masks in Ocarina of Time are limited to an optional side @-@ quest , they play a central role in Majora 's Mask , which has twenty @-@ four masks in total . 
 Link can transform at will into different creatures : the Deku Mask transforms Link into a Deku Scrub , the Goron Mask into a Goron , and the Zora Mask into a Zora . Each form features unique abilities : Deku Link can perform a spin attack , shoot bubbles from his mouth , skip on water , and fly for a short time by launching from Deku Flowers ; Goron Link can roll at high speeds ( and grow spikes at higher speeds ) , punch with deadly force , stomp the ground with his massive , rock @-@ like body , walk in lava without taking damage , and weigh down heavy switches ; Zora Link can swim rapidly , throw boomerang @-@ like fins from his arms , generate a force field , and walk on the bottoms of bodies of water . Many areas can be accessed only by use of these abilities . 
 Link and his three transformations receive different reactions from non @-@ player characters . For instance , the Goron and Zora are allowed to exit Clock Town at will , whereas the Deku Scrub is not permitted to leave by reason of his childlike resemblance . Animals also interact differently with the four forms of Link . For example , Link 's normal form receives an indifferent response from dogs , Deku Link is attacked by them , Goron Link frightens them , and Zora Link makes them chase him happily . 
 The final mask to be gained in the game is the Fierce Deity 's Mask . Although the use of this mask is strictly limited to boss battles only , it is possible to wear it anywhere using a glitch . Upon donning this mask , Link grows to nearly two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half times his normal height . His clothes turn white and his face appears with a type of war paint on it . The sword that Fierce Deity Link carries is a helix shape that uses magic power to blast fire at enemies . 
 Other masks provide situational benefits . For example , the Great Fairy 's Mask helps retrieve stray fairies scattered throughout the four temples , the Bunny Hood allows Link to run faster , and the Stone Mask renders Link invisible to most non @-@ playable characters and enemies . Less valuable masks are usually involved only in optional side @-@ quests or specialized situations . Examples include the Postman 's Hat , which grants Link access to items in mailboxes , and <unk> 's Mask , which initiates a long side @-@ quest to receive the Couple 's Mask . 
 = = = Three @-@ day cycle and songs = = = 
 Majora 's Mask imposes a time limit of three days ( 72 hours ) game @-@ time , which is about 54 minutes in real time . An on @-@ screen clock tracks the day and time . Link can return to 6 : 00 am on the first day by playing the " Song of Time " on the Ocarina of Time . If he does not before the 72 hours expire , then the moon will destroy Clock Town , including all the surrounding regions of Termina and Link will lose everything he accomplished . A real @-@ time countdown will begin when only 6 hours remain . However , returning to the first day saves the player 's progress and major accomplishments permanently , such as the acquisition of maps , masks , songs , and weapons . Cleared puzzles , keys , and minor items will be lost , as well as any rupees not in the bank , and almost all characters will have no recollection of meeting Link . Link can slow down time or warp to the next morning or evening by playing two variations of the Song of Time . Owl statues scattered across certain major areas of the world allow the player to temporarily save their progress once they have been activated , and also provide warp points to quickly move around the world . 
 Other uses for songs include manipulating the weather , teleporting between owl statues spread throughout Termina , and unlocking the four temples . Each transformation mask uses a different instrument : Deku Link plays a multi @-@ horn instrument called the " Deku Pipes " , Goron Link plays a set of bongo drums tied around his waist , and Zora Link plays a guitar made from a large fish skeleton . Jackson Guitars created a limited edition 7 @-@ string replica of this guitar that was the grand prize in a contest in Nintendo Power , known as the " Jackson <unk> " . The game reuses three of Ocarina of Time 's ocarina songs : the " Song of Time " ; the " Song of Storms " , for aforementioned weather manipulation ; and " Epona 's Song " , which again summons Link 's horse . 
 During the three @-@ day cycle , many non @-@ player characters follow fixed schedules that Link can track using the Bomber 's Notebook . The notebook tracks the twenty characters in need of help , such as a soldier to whom Link delivers medicine , and an engaged couple whom Link reunites . Blue bars on the notebook 's timeline indicate when characters are available for interaction , and icons indicate that Link has received items , such as masks , from the characters . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Setting and characters = = = 
 The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask is set in Termina , a land parallel to Hyrule , the latter being the main setting of most games in the series . According to legend , Termina was split into four areas by four magical giants that live in four regions of the land . At the center of Termina lies Clock Town , which features a large clock tower that counts down the days before the Carnival of Time — a major festival where the people of Termina pray for good luck and harvests . Termina Field surrounds Clock Town ; beyond lie a swamp , mountain range , bay , and canyon in each of the four cardinal directions . 
 The Southern Swamp contains the Deku Palace and the Woodfall Temple , an ancient shrine containing monsters and a giant masked jungle warrior , <unk> , who has been poisoning the swamp . 
 The Snowhead mountain range , north of Clock Town , is the site of the Goron village . Normally a lush pine forest region most of the year , the area has been experiencing an unusually long winter caused by a giant masked mechanical monster named <unk> in Snowhead Temple . 
 Romani Ranch , southwest of Clock Town , is the site of a ranch which houses Romani , her older sister , <unk> , Grog , and <unk> Yan . Before Link entered Termina , Skull Kid caused a huge boulder to block Romani Ranch . If you go to Milk Road on the dawn of the final day , The boulder disappears and you could go to Romani Ranch or you could use a Powder Keg after you defeated <unk> . 
 The western area of Termina , the Great Bay , is the site of the Zora and Gerudo civilizations . A gargantuan masked fish , <unk> , is generating storms and contaminating the water surrounding the Great Bay Temple . 
 The desolate <unk> Canyon , to the east of Clock Town , is the site of a former kingdom . It is inhabited mainly by the undead , except for a ghost researcher and his daughter Pamela , as well as a thief named Sakon . A pair of giant masked insectoid serpents known as <unk> from their nest in Stone Tower Temple are casting a dark aura over the land , causing the dead bodies of former citizens and soldiers to come back to life as undead monsters . 
 At the end of the game , Link is transported to the moon , which is portrayed as a green field with a single , large tree in the centre with masked children playing underneath it . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Majora 's Mask takes place a few months after The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time and begins with Link searching for his departed fairy , Navi . While riding through a forest in Hyrule on his horse Epona , Link is ambushed by the masked Skull Kid and his fairy accomplices Tatl and Tael , who steal both Epona and his musical instrument , the Ocarina of Time . Link follows them into Termina , where he confronts the Skull Kid , who curses him by turning him into a Deku Scrub . Tatl stops Link from going after the Skull Kid as the latter escapes with Tael through a door , but is then separated from them when the door closes behind them . Realizing she needs Link 's help to find them , Tatl insists that they work together . Link follows the Skull Kid into the inside of the Clock Tower in the land of Termina . There , he meets the Happy Mask Salesman , who seemed to have been following him . The salesman offers to help Link heal his curse , in exchange for which he must retrieve both the Ocarina of Time and the Majora 's Mask from the Skull Kid . The Skull Kid , having stolen the Majora 's Mask from the salesman , became possessed by its overwhelming power and transformed into an uncontrollable fiend who inflicts certain misfortune on others , the worst of which is an impending apocalypse : the moon is now set to collide with the world in approximately three days time . 
 From a gate inside Clock Tower , Link and Tatl enter Clock Town while its population prepares for the town 's annual Carnival of Time also scheduled to take place in three days . Together they learn that the Skull Kid is waiting at the top of the tower , which is only accessible during the eve of the carnival . After conditions are met , Link and Tatl arrive at the top of the Clock Tower to witness Tael hurriedly speak a riddle to them : " Swamp . Mountain . Ocean . Canyon ... hurry , the four who are there ... bring them here ! " Link is unable to fight the Skull Kid , nor does he have any means to take the mask from him , but manages to get the Ocarina of Time back from his hands . After playing the " Song of Time " on the ocarina , Link and Tatl are brought backwards through time three days earlier — with the ocarina still in his possession and with both him and Tatl having complete memory of all that happened . Meeting with the Happy Mask Salesman again , he sees Link has retrieved his ocarina , and hence teaches him the " Song of Healing " , which breaks the curse , returns Link to his human form and seals his Deku Scrub form into a mask which has the power to turn him back into a Deku Scrub if needed . After he finds out Link did not bring back the mask , he panics and explains that the mask conceals an evil , apocalyptic power that was once used by an ancient tribe in <unk> rituals . The troubles caused by the mask were so great , that the ancient ones " sealed the mask in shadow forever " to prevent it from being misused . Link must then travel between the four cardinal regions of Termina : Woodfall , Snowhead , the Great Bay , and <unk> Canyon , for each region conceals one of the Four Giants who will be able , once reunited , to halt the moon 's crashing . At the same time , each region has been struck with a terrible curse by the Skull Kid which plagues its inhabitants and seals away its giant . To lift the curse and free the giants , Link must enter a dungeon in each region and defeat its boss . After doing so , he obtains the power to summon the giant he has set free . 
 With all four curses lifted , Link climbs on top of the Clock Tower at midnight on the third day to confront the Skull Kid again . There and then , he summons the Four Giants , who halt the moon 's descent toward Termina by holding it up with their arms . Now seeing the Skull Kid as a useless puppet , Majora 's Mask drops his grip on him and flies up to possess the moon instead . With Tatl at his side , Link follows the Majora 's Mask inside the moon and defeats him once and for all , returning the moon to its proper place in the sky . The Four Giants return to their sleep . Tatl and Tael reunite with the newly liberated Skull Kid . The Happy Mask Salesman takes Majora 's Mask , stating it has been purified of its evil power . Link rides away on Epona while the people of Termina celebrate the Carnival of Time and the dawn of a new day . 
 The game ends with a post @-@ credits scene depicting Link and Epona back in the mysterious forest , resuming Link 's search for his friend , as they ride off towards a mysterious light breaking through the thick forest . A drawing on a tree stump of Link , Tatl , Tael , the Skull Kid , and the Four Giants is shown after . 
 = = Development = = 
 Following the release of Link 's Awakening in 1993 , fans waited five years for Ocarina of Time , the active development of which took four years . By re @-@ using the game engine and graphics from Ocarina of Time , a smaller team required only one year to finish Majora 's Mask . According to director Eiji Aonuma , they were " faced with the very difficult question of just what kind of game could follow Ocarina of Time and its worldwide sales of seven million units " , and as a solution , came up with the three @-@ day system to " make the game data more compact while still providing deep gameplay " . Shigeru Miyamoto and Yoshiaki Koizumi came up with the story that served as the basis for the script written by Mitsuhiro Takano . The idea of the " Three @-@ Day System " came from Miyamoto and Koizumi . 
 Majora 's Mask first appeared in the media in May 1999 , when Famitsu stated that a long @-@ planned Zelda expansion for the 64DD was underway in Japan . This project was tentatively titled " Ura Zelda " ( " ura " translates roughly to " hidden " or " behind " ) . This expansion would take Ocarina of Time and alter the level designs , similar to how the " master quest " expanded upon the original Legend of Zelda . In June , Nintendo announced that " Zelda : Gaiden " , which roughly translates to " Zelda : Side Story " , would appear as a playable demo at the Nintendo Space World exhibition on August 27 , 1999 . The media assumed that Zelda : Gaiden was the new working title for Ura Zelda . 
 Screenshots of Zelda : Gaiden released in August 1999 show unmistakable elements of the final version of Majora 's Mask , such as the large clock that dominates the center of Clock Town , the timer at the bottom of the screen , and the Goron Mask . Story and gameplay details revealed later that month show that the story concept as well as the use of transformation masks were already in place .
