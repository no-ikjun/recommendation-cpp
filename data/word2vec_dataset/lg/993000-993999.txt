 Oxidation states above + 2 in a non @-@ charged species are extremely rare , although a cyclic <unk> ( IV ) cation , with three substituents , may be an intermediate in <unk> reactions . In 2007 , a report of synthesis of a mercury ( IV ) compound , mercury ( IV ) fluoride , was published . In the 1970s , there was a claim on synthesis of a mercury ( III ) compound , but it is now thought to be false . 
 = = = <unk> compounds = = = 
 Organic mercury compounds are historically important but are of little industrial value in the western world . Mercury ( II ) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings . <unk> compounds are always divalent and usually two @-@ coordinate and linear geometry . Unlike <unk> and organozinc compounds , <unk> compounds do not react with water . They usually have the formula <unk> , which are often volatile , or <unk> , which are often solids , where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate . <unk> , a generic term for compounds with the formula <unk> , is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water . They arise by a process known as <unk> . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications . It is used in some thermometers , especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures . A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps , while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive <unk> alloy . 
 = = = Medicine = = = 
 Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine , although they are much less common today than they once were , now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood . The first edition of the Merck 's Manual featured many mercuric compounds such as : 
 Mercury is an ingredient in dental amalgams . Thiomersal ( called <unk> in the United States ) is an organic compound used as a preservative in vaccines , though this use is in decline . Thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury . Although it was widely speculated that this mercury @-@ based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children , scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link . Nevertheless , thiomersal has been removed from , or reduced to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 years of age and under , with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine . 
 Another mercury compound , <unk> ( Mercurochrome ) , is a topical antiseptic used for minor cuts and scrapes that is still in use in some countries . 
 Mercury in the form of one of its common ores , cinnabar , is used in various traditional medicines , especially in traditional Chinese medicine . Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated , consumed in overdose , or taken long term , and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses , though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible . Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms , its use in traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been justified , as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear . 
 Today , the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects , especially in developed countries . Thermometers and sphygmomanometers containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries , respectively . In the early 21st century , their use is declining and has been banned in some countries , states and medical institutions . In 2002 , the U.S. Senate passed legislation to phase out the sale of non @-@ prescription mercury thermometers . In 2003 , Washington and Maine became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices . Mercury compounds are found in some over @-@ the @-@ counter drugs , including topical antiseptics , stimulant laxatives , diaper @-@ rash ointment , eye drops , and nasal sprays . The FDA has " inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness " of the mercury ingredients in these products . Mercury is still used in some diuretics although substitutes now exist for most therapeutic uses . 
 = = = Production of chlorine and caustic soda = = = 
 Chlorine is produced from sodium chloride ( common salt , NaCl ) using electrolysis to separate the metallic sodium from the chlorine gas . Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine . By @-@ products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen ( H2 ) and sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) , which is commonly called caustic soda or lye . By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the mercury cell process ( also called the Castner @-@ Kellner process ) where metallic sodium is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury ; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide . Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process , although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard . After about 1985 , all new chloralkali production facilities that were built in the United States used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine . 
 = = = Laboratory uses = = = 
 Some medical thermometers , especially those for high temperatures , are filled with mercury ; they are gradually disappearing . In the United States , non @-@ prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers has been banned since 2003 . 
 Mercury is also found in liquid mirror telescopes . 
 Some transit telescopes use a basin of mercury to form a flat and absolutely horizontal mirror , useful in determining an absolute vertical or perpendicular reference . <unk> horizontal parabolic mirrors may be formed by rotating liquid mercury on a disk , the parabolic form of the liquid thus formed reflecting and focusing incident light . Such telescopes are cheaper than conventional large mirror telescopes by up to a factor of 100 , but the mirror cannot be tilted and always points straight up . 
 Liquid mercury is a part of popular secondary reference electrode ( called the calomel electrode ) in electrochemistry as an alternative to the standard hydrogen electrode . The calomel electrode is used to work out the electrode potential of half cells . Last , but not least , the triple point of mercury , − 38 @.@ <unk> ° C , is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale ( ITS @-@ 90 ) . 
 In <unk> both the dropping mercury electrode and the hanging mercury drop electrode use elemental mercury . This use allows a new uncontaminated electrode to be available for each measurement or each new experiment . 
 = = = Niche uses = = = 
 Gaseous mercury is used in mercury @-@ vapor lamps and some " neon sign " type advertising signs and fluorescent lamps . Those low @-@ pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines , which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position . Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose ; reflecting a fluorescent ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice . Gaseous mercury is also found in some electron tubes , including <unk> , <unk> , and mercury arc rectifiers . It is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection . Gaseous mercury is added to cold cathode argon @-@ filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity . An argon @-@ filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly . Lighting containing mercury can be bombarded / oven pumped only once . When added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red / blue spots until the initial burning @-@ in process is completed ; eventually it will light a consistent dull off @-@ blue color .

 Mercury , as thiomersal , is widely used in the manufacture of mascara . In 2008 , Minnesota became the first state in the United States to ban intentionally added mercury in cosmetics , giving it a tougher standard than the federal government . 
 A study in geometric mean urine mercury concentration identified a previously unrecognized source of exposure ( skin care products ) to inorganic mercury among New York City residents . Population @-@ based <unk> also showed that mercury concentration levels are higher in consumers of seafood and fish meals .

 = = = Historic uses = = = 
 Many historic applications made use of the peculiar physical properties of mercury , especially as a dense liquid and a liquid metal : 
 Quantities of liquid mercury ranging from 90 to 600 grams ( 3 @.@ 2 to 21 @.@ 2 oz ) have been recovered from elite Maya tombs ( 100 @-@ <unk> ) or ritual caches at six sites . This mercury may have been used in bowls as mirrors for divinatory purposes . Five of these date to the Classic Period of Maya civilization ( c . 250 – 900 ) but one example predated this . 
 In Islamic Spain , it was used for filling decorative pools . Later , the American artist Alexander Calder built a mercury fountain for the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris . The fountain is now on display at the <unk> Joan Miró in Barcelona . 
 Mercury was used inside wobbler lures . Its heavy , liquid form made it useful since the lures made an attractive irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug . Such use was stopped due to environmental concerns , but illegal preparation of modern fishing plugs has occurred . 
 The Fresnel lenses of old lighthouses used to float and rotate in a bath of mercury which acted like a bearing . 
 Mercury sphygmomanometers ( blood pressure meter ) , barometers , diffusion pumps , <unk> , and many other laboratory instruments . As an opaque liquid with a high density and a nearly linear thermal expansion , it is ideal for this role . 
 As an electrically conductive liquid , it was used in mercury switches ( including home mercury light switches installed prior to 1970 ) , tilt switches used in old fire detectors , and tilt switches in some home thermostats . 
 Owing to its acoustic properties , mercury was used as the propagation medium in delay line memory devices used in early digital computers of the mid @-@ 20th century . 
 Experimental mercury vapor turbines were installed to increase the efficiency of fossil @-@ fuel electrical power plants . The South Meadow power plant in Hartford , CT employed mercury as its working fluid , in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit , for a number of years starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency . Several other plants were built , including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth , NH , which went online in 1950 . The idea did not catch on industry @-@ wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury , as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years . 
 Similarly , liquid mercury was used as a coolant for some nuclear reactors ; however , sodium is proposed for reactors cooled with liquid metal , because the high density of mercury requires much more energy to circulate as coolant . 
 Mercury was a propellant for early ion engines in electric space propulsion systems . Advantages were mercury 's high molecular weight , low ionization energy , low dual @-@ ionization energy , high liquid density and liquid <unk> at room temperature . Disadvantages were concerns regarding environmental impact associated with ground testing and concerns about eventual cooling and condensation of some of the propellant on the spacecraft in long @-@ duration operations . The first spaceflight to use electric propulsion was a mercury @-@ fueled ion thruster developed by NASA Lewis and flown on the Space Electric Rocket Test " SERT @-@ 1 " spacecraft launched by NASA at its Wallops Flight Facility in 1964 . The SERT @-@ 1 flight was followed up by the SERT @-@ 2 flight in 1970 . Mercury and caesium were preferred propellants for ion engines until Hughes Research Laboratory performed studies finding xenon gas to be a suitable replacement . Xenon is now the preferred propellant for ion engines as it has a high molecular weight , little or no reactivity due to its noble gas nature , and has a high liquid density under mild cryogenic storage . 
 Others applications made use of the chemical properties of mercury : 
 The mercury battery is a non @-@ rechargeable electrochemical battery , a primary cell , that was common in the middle of the 20th century . It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes , particularly button sizes . Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids . The mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills . 
 Mercury was used for preserving wood , developing daguerreotypes , silvering mirrors , anti @-@ fouling paints ( discontinued in 1990 ) , herbicides ( discontinued in 1995 ) , handheld maze games , cleaning , and road leveling devices in cars . Mercury compounds have been used in antiseptics , laxatives , antidepressants , and in <unk> . 
 It was allegedly used by allied spies to sabotage Luftwaffe planes : a mercury paste was applied to bare aluminium , causing the metal to rapidly corrode ; this would cause structural failures . 
 <unk> process : The largest industrial use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine ; mercury being the anode of the Castner @-@ Kellner process . The chlorine was used for bleaching paper ( hence the location of many of these plants near paper mills ) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products . This usage has largely been discontinued , replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells . 
 As electrodes in some types of electrolysis , batteries ( mercury cells ) , sodium hydroxide and chlorine production , handheld games , catalysts , insecticides . 
 Mercury was once used as a gun barrel bore cleaner . 
 From the mid @-@ 18th to the mid @-@ 19th centuries , a process called " <unk> " was used in the making of felt hats . Animal skins were rinsed in an orange solution ( the term " <unk> " arose from this color ) of the mercury compound mercuric nitrate , Hg ( NO3 ) 2 · 2H2O . This process separated the fur from the pelt and matted it together . This solution and the vapors it produced were highly toxic . The United States Public Health Service banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in December 1941 . The psychological symptoms associated with mercury poisoning inspired the phrase " mad as a hatter " . Lewis Carroll 's " Mad Hatter " in his book Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland was a play on words based on the older phrase , but the character himself does not exhibit symptoms of mercury poisoning . 
 Gold and silver mining . Historically , mercury was used extensively in hydraulic gold mining in order to help the gold to sink through the flowing water @-@ gravel mixture . Thin gold particles may form mercury @-@ gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates . Large @-@ scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s . However , mercury is still used in small scale , often clandestine , gold prospecting . It is estimated that 45 @,@ 000 metric tons of mercury used in California for placer mining have not been recovered . Mercury was also used in silver mining .

 Mercury ( I ) chloride ( also known as calomel or <unk> chloride ) has been used in traditional medicine as a diuretic , topical disinfectant , and laxative . Mercury ( II ) chloride ( also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate ) was once used to treat syphilis ( along with other mercury compounds ) , although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat . It is also used as a disinfectant . Blue mass , a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient , was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation , depression , child @-@ bearing and <unk> . In the early 20th century , mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and <unk> , and it was used in teething powders for infants . The mercury @-@ containing <unk> <unk> ( sometimes sold as Mercurochrome ) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S. 
 = = Toxicity and safety = = 
 Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and must be handled with care ; in cases of spills involving mercury ( such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs ) , specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill . Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces , combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an <unk> , or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container . Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used . Afterwards , fine sulfur , zinc , or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam ( alloy ) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of . Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill . 
 Mercury can be absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and mercury vapors can be inhaled , so containers of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation . Heating of mercury , or of compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated , should be carried out with adequate ventilation in order to minimize exposure to mercury vapor . The most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds , such as <unk> and methylmercury . Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning . 
 = = = Releases in the environment = = = 
 <unk> deposition rates of mercury from the atmosphere may be about 4 ng / ( 1 L of ice deposit ) . Although that can be considered a natural level of exposure , regional or global sources have significant effects . Volcanic eruptions can increase the atmospheric source by 4 – 6 times . 
 Natural sources , such as volcanoes , are responsible for approximately half of atmospheric mercury emissions . The human @-@ generated half can be divided into the following estimated percentages : 
 65 % from stationary combustion , of which coal @-@ fired power plants are the largest aggregate source ( 40 % of U.S. mercury emissions in 1999 ) . This includes power plants fueled with gas where the mercury has not been removed . Emissions from coal combustion are between one and two orders of magnitude higher than emissions from oil combustion , depending on the country . 
 11 % from gold production . The three largest point sources for mercury emissions in the U.S. are the three largest gold mines . <unk> release of mercury from gold @-@ mine tailings has been accounted as a significant source of atmospheric mercury in eastern Canada . 
 6 @.@ 8 % from non @-@ ferrous metal production , typically smelters . 
 6 @.@ 4 % from cement production . 
 3 @.@ 0 % from waste disposal , including municipal and hazardous waste , crematoria , and sewage sludge incineration . 
 3 @.@ 0 % from caustic soda production . 
 1 @.@ 4 % from pig iron and steel production . 
 1 @.@ 1 % from mercury production , mainly for batteries . 
 2 @.@ 0 % from other sources . 
 The above percentages are estimates of the global human @-@ caused mercury emissions in 2000 , excluding biomass burning , an important source in some regions . 
 Recent atmospheric mercury contamination in outdoor urban air was measured at 0 @.@ 01 – 0 @.@ 02 µg / m3 . A 2001 study measured mercury levels in 12 indoor sites chosen to represent a cross @-@ section of building types , locations and ages in the New York area . This study found mercury concentrations significantly elevated over outdoor concentrations , at a range of 0 @.@ 0065 – 0 @.@ 523 μg / m3 . The average was 0 @.@ 069 μg / m3 . 
 Mercury also enters into the environment through the improper disposal ( e.g. , land filling , incineration ) of certain products . Products containing mercury include : auto parts , batteries , fluorescent bulbs , medical products , thermometers , and thermostats . Due to health concerns ( see below ) , toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products . For example , the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14 @.@ 5 tons in 2004 to 3 @.@ 9 tons in 2007 . 
 Most thermometers now use pigmented alcohol instead of mercury , and galinstan alloy thermometers are also an option . Mercury thermometers are still occasionally used in the medical field because they are more accurate than alcohol thermometers , though both are commonly being replaced by electronic thermometers and less commonly by galinstan thermometers . Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range . 
 Historically , one of the largest releases was from the <unk> plant , a lithium @-@ isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge , Tennessee . The plant operated in the 1950s and 1960s . Records are incomplete and unclear , but government commissions have estimated that some two million pounds of mercury are unaccounted for . 
 A serious industrial disaster was the dumping of mercury compounds into Minamata Bay , Japan . It is estimated that over 3 @,@ 000 people suffered various deformities , severe mercury poisoning symptoms or death from what became known as Minamata disease . 
 = = = Occupational exposure = = = 
 Due to the health effects of mercury exposure , industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries . The World Health Organization , OSHA , and NIOSH all treat mercury as an occupational hazard , and have established specific occupational exposure limits . Environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the United States Environmental Protection Agency . 
 Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors , impaired cognitive skills , and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0 @.@ 7 – 42 μg / m3 . A study has shown that acute exposure ( 4 – 8 hours ) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1 @.@ 1 to 44 mg / m3 resulted in chest pain , dyspnea , cough , hemoptysis , impairment of pulmonary function , and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis . Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects , including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium , hallucinations , and suicidal tendency . Occupational exposure has resulted in broad @-@ ranging functional disturbance , including <unk> , irritability , excitability , excessive shyness , and insomnia . With continuing exposure , a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms . Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids , lips , and tongue . Long @-@ term , low @-@ level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of <unk> , including fatigue , irritability , loss of memory , vivid dreams and depression . 
 = = = Treatment = = = 
 Research on the treatment of mercury poisoning is limited . Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N @-@ acetyl @-@ D , L @-@ penicillamine ( NAP ) , British Anti @-@ Lewisite ( BAL ) , 2 @,@ 3 @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 @-@ <unk> acid ( <unk> ) , and <unk> acid ( DMSA ) . In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury , patients were treated with DMSA and NAP . Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of a small fraction of the total estimated body mercury . DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than NAP . 
 = = = Fish = = = 
 Fish and shellfish have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies , often in the form of methylmercury , a highly toxic organic compound of mercury . Species of fish that are high on the food chain , such as shark , swordfish , king mackerel , bluefin tuna , <unk> tuna , and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others . As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble , they primarily accumulate in the viscera , although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue . When this fish is consumed by a predator , the mercury level is accumulated . Since fish are less efficient at <unk> than accumulating methylmercury , fish @-@ tissue concentrations increase over time . Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume . This process is called biomagnification . Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata , Japan , now called Minamata disease .

 140 countries agreed in the Minamata Convention on Mercury by the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) to prevent emissions . The convention was signed on the 10th of October 2013 . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 In the United States , the Environmental Protection Agency is charged with regulating and managing mercury contamination . Several laws give the EPA this authority , including the Clean Air Act , the Clean Water Act , the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act , and the Safe Drinking Water Act . Additionally , the Mercury @-@ Containing and <unk> Battery Management Act , passed in 1996 , phases out the use of mercury in batteries , and provides for the efficient and cost @-@ effective disposal of many types of used batteries . North America contributed approximately 11 % of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995 . 
 The United States Clean Air Act , passed in 1990 , put mercury on a list of toxic pollutants that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent . Thus , industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies ( <unk> ) . In March 2005 , the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system . States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls , but after a legal challenge from several states , the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008 . The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal @-@ fired power plants , given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998 . However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply , indicating that the Clean Air Act had its intended impact . 
 The EPA announced new rules for coal @-@ fired power plants on 22 December 2011 . Cement kilns that burn hazardous waste are held to a looser standard than are standard hazardous waste incinerators in the United States , and as a result are a disproportionate source of mercury pollution .

 = The Homer They Fall = 
 " The Homer They Fall " is the third episode of The Simpsons ' eighth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 10 , 1996 . After Homer Simpson realizes he has a bizarre medical condition that renders him unable to be knocked out , he decides to embark on a career as a boxer with Moe Szyslak as his manager . It was written by Jonathan Collier and directed by Mark Kirkland . The episode guest stars Michael Buffer as himself and Paul Winfield as Lucius Sweet . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Simpsons visit a high @-@ tech gadget store and Bart buys a gimmicky utility belt from Comic Book Guy for $ 4 . He shows off its features to his classmates until he is beaten up by Dolph , Jimbo and Kearney , who steal the belt . In response , Homer decides to talk with the bullies ' fathers at Moe 's Tavern , but he is also beaten ; however , they are unnerved when they cannot even knock Homer down , and are then chased away by a shotgun @-@ wielding Moe . 
 Moe is impressed by Homer 's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing , with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager . Marge is annoyed by the idea , but a medical test diagnoses Homer with a rare genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near @-@ invulnerable to knockout punches . However , while training , it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher , and is extremely out of shape . Moe <unk> that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out , and then knock them down with a tap . Marge insists that Homer get a physical by a competent doctor , hoping he won 't pass the requirements for a boxing license . However , Homer easily passes the state requirement to box , wrestle or " be shot out of a cannon " , as the state Springfield is in had apparently been founded by circus freaks . 
 Homer does well in his first fights , mainly because he 's competing in Springfields " hobo fight " circuit , against opponents almost as out of shape as he is . At every match , he follows Moe 's advice and starts to gain widespread attention , eventually becoming the top ranked fighter in the Springfield Hobo Boxing Association . Moe 's former boxing manager , Lucius Sweet visits Moe and announces that the current Heavyweight Champion , Drederick Tatum is being released from prison and is ready for a comeback fight , and Sweet wants Tatum to fight Homer . Tatum has become infamous for scoring one @-@ punch knockouts in his opening move , resulting in matches to which last only a few seconds . Lucius hopes that due to Homer 's fame as a human punching bag , he will at least be able to endure a few rounds before being bludgeoned unconscious . Moe , despite knowing full well that Tatum is far too strong for a fighter of Homer 's ability , still wants to take his last shot at the big time and promises Sweet that Homer will last three rounds with Tatum . 
 Tatum is paroled and the media begins hyping the fight . The odds against Homer are 1000 – 1 and everybody believes that Homer will lose . Even Homer himself visualizes that the only way he could win is if a heart defect fells Tatum before entering the ring . Marge makes Moe promise her that the moment Homer is in any danger , he will throw in the towel . But after Marge leaves , Moe throws away the towel in a garbage can . 
 The fight starts and it is soon obvious that Homer cannot withstand Tatum 's fearsome barrage and is in danger of being knocked out within six seconds . Homer decides to fight back , but misses completely . Moe , seeing Homer get destroyed , flees . As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow , Moe flies in using the Fan Man 's paramotor and carries Homer away , saving him . Outside the arena , Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer . Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser , but still gives him a check for $ 100 @,@ 000 . Moe starts up the <unk> 's paramotor and flies off into the night , during the credits he is seen helping people around the world with the paramotor .

 The episode was written by Jonathan Collier , who is a huge boxing fan . Knowing that the people on the internet would " give them grief " , the writers went to a lot of effort to explain how Homer would be able to challenge for the Heavyweight Title . A lot of the scenes involving Homer fighting hobos were pitched by John Swartzwelder . Lucius Sweet is a parody of Don King , voiced by Paul Winfield who had previously played King in HBO 's 1995 biopic Tyson . In the script , Sweet was described as " A Don King type who looks and sounds exactly like Don King . " The similarity is even pointed out by Homer with the line " He is exactly as rich and as famous as Don King – and he looks just like him , too ! " King was asked to guest star , but turned the part down . Drederick Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson . The name came from George Meyer , who went to high school with a boy named Drederick Timmins , which Meyer thought was a cool name . Tatum 's having done time in prison is a reference to the fact that , at the time of the episode 's production , Tyson had just recently been released from prison after serving three years for rape . Homer is named " The Southern Dandy " as a reference to the old @-@ time boxers and wrestlers who had similar nicknames . 
 In preparation for this episode , Mark Kirkland watched several boxing films and is satisfied with how it turned out . Whenever designing rooms , Kirkland tries to show a bare lightbulb because he feels that it makes things more depressing . In the scene in Moe 's office , there is a brief shot of a poster advertising " Szyslak Vs . Oakley " and " Kirkland Vs . Silverman , " referring to then @-@ executive producer Bill Oakley and Simpsons directors Mark Kirkland and David Silverman . The scene where Tatum is walking to the ring surrounded by shady characters , one of whom appears to be cross @-@ eyed , is based on a real life photo of Tyson . 
 Jimbo 's , Dolph 's , and Kearney 's fathers make their first and only appearances in the history of the show . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode opens with a parody of Bonanza . The montage of Homer fighting various hobos was based on a similar montage in Raging Bull . The music is " The Flower Duet " from the opera " Lakmé " by Léo Delibes . During the montage , there is a brief parody of the George Bellows painting " Dempsey and Firpo " . The " Fan Man " is based on James Miller , a fan famous for parachuting into arenas during big events . Homer 's walk @-@ out music is " Why Can 't We Be Friends ? " by War and Tatum 's is " Time 4 Sum <unk> " by Redman . The song heard over the end credits is a rendition of Barbra Streisand 's " People , " sung by Sally Stevens .

 = = Football administration = = 
 Hemmingham first started in football administration as the chief executive of an independent supporters group called The Owls Trust , which he helped establish , in 2001 . The Owls Trust was disliked by many Sheffield Wednesday fans and by Sheffield Wednesday chairman Dave Allen as it was perceived that it was a vehicle leading towards a takeover by Ken Bates , then chairman of Sheffield Wednesday 's rivals Leeds United , as The Owls Trust controlled a large amount of shares and Hemmingham had publicly stated support for Bates . 
 After an attempted boardroom coup by The Owls Trust to remove Allen from the chairmanship in an extraordinary general meeting in October 2004 , in 2005 , The Owls Trust were evicted from their offices at Hillsborough Stadium , Hemmingham was banned from executive areas of the stadium and The Kop Band was asked to reduce its numbers by Allen . Hemmingham 's ban was then later extended to a full stadium ban from Hillsborough .

This led to Hemmingham receiving death threats from Sheffield Wednesday fans . 
 In January 2008 , Hemmingham left Leeds United and in August , he was appointed as the chief executive of non @-@ league side , Mansfield Town where he oversaw the expansion of the capacity of their Field Mill stadium .

 = 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane = 
 The 1821 Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane was one of four known tropical cyclones that have made landfall in New York City . Another , even more intense hurricane in pre @-@ Columbian times ( sometime between 1278 and 1438 ) left evidence that was detected in southern New Jersey by paleotempestological research . The third was the 1893 New York hurricane , and the fourth was Hurricane Irene in 2011 . 
 The first of three recorded tropical cyclones recorded in the 1821 Atlantic hurricane season , the storm that would eventually strike New York was first observed off the southeast United States coast on September 1 , with winds estimated in excess of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) . It moved ashore near Wilmington , North Carolina , and passed near Norfolk , Virginia before moving through the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey just inland . On September 3 , the hurricane struck approximately near Jamaica Bay , which later became part of New York City , and on September 4 it was observed over New England . This was just 6 years after the destructive Great September Gale of 1815 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical cyclone was first observed on September 1 off the southeast coast of the United States . Initially , it was believed to be the same storm that struck Guadeloupe on the same day , though subsequent research indicated there were two separate storms . The hurricane tracked by the Bahamas while tracking generally northward , and it attained major hurricane status over the western Atlantic Ocean . As it approached the United States coastline , the hurricane was very intense , with winds estimated at over 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) and potentially as strong as 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) , or a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . Late on September 2 , the hurricane made landfall near Wilmington , North Carolina and later turned to the northeast to cross the Pamlico Sound . 
 The hurricane accelerated northeastward , and passed over the Hampton Roads area early on September 3 . After crossing the Chesapeake Bay , the cyclone traversed the Delmarva Peninsula near the Atlantic coastline , and at around 1500 UTC the eye passed directly over Cape Henlopen , Delaware ; a thirty @-@ minute period of calm was reported . It continued across the Delaware Bay and later passed over Cape May , New Jersey , where a fifteen @-@ minute calm was reported . Modern researchers estimate it was a Category 3 or Category 4 hurricane upon striking New Jersey , one of the few hurricanes to hit the state . Moving ashore at very low tide , it paralleled the state 's coastline just inland , and after exiting into Lower New York Bay the hurricane made landfall on New York City at around 1930 UTC on September 3 ; this makes it the only major hurricane to directly hit the city . A minimal hurricane in 1893 also made landfall on what later became part of New York City . One modern researcher estimates the hurricane was moving at a forward speed of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) , and upon moving ashore had a pressure of 965 mbar . The hurricane continued northeastward through New England , and after entering Massachusetts on September 4 its exact path was unknown ; one researcher estimated the cyclone tracked northeastward until losing its identity over southeastern Maine , while another assessed the storm as passing far to the west of Maine . 
 Based on the arrangement of effects in New England , meteorologist William C. Redfield deduced that the wind field and center of tropical cyclones are circular ; previously the winds were believed to be in a straight line . 
 = = Impact = = 
 In North Carolina , a powerful storm surge flooded large portions of Portsmouth Island ; residents estimated the island would have been completely under water had the worst of the storm lasted for two more hours . Strong winds occurred across eastern North Carolina , resulting in at least 76 destroyed houses . Numerous people were killed in Currituck . 
 The strongest winds of the hurricane lasted for about an hour in southeastern Virginia , after which the storm rapidly abated . Several houses were completely destroyed , with many others receiving moderate to severe damage . The winds destroyed most of the roof of the courthouse , and uprooted trees across the region ; fallen tree limbs damaged a stone bridge in Norfolk . The hurricane produced a strong storm surge along the Virginia coastline , which reached 10 feet ( 3 m ) at Pungoteague on the Delmarva Peninsula . The storm surge , which reached several hundred yards inland , destroyed two bridges and flooded many warehouses along the Elizabeth River . Rough waves grounded the USS Guerriere and the USS Congress , and also destroyed several schooners and brigs . Along the eastern shore , the storm surge flooded barrier islands along the Atlantic coastline , causing severe crop damage and downing many trees . Several houses were destroyed , and at Pungoteague the impact of the hurricane was described as " unexampled destruction " ; five people drowned in Chincoteague . Considered one of the most violent hurricanes on record in the Mid @-@ Atlantic , the hurricane caused $ 200 @,@ 000 in damage in Virginia ( 1821 USD , $ 3 @.@ 1 million 2007 USD ) . 
 Gale force winds affected the Delmarva Peninsula ; on Poplar Island in Talbot County , Maryland , winds peaked at 1600 UTC on September 3 . The strongest winds were confined to the Atlantic coastline , with outer rainbands producing heavy rainfall in Washington , D.C. and Baltimore , Maryland . Fierce winds were observed in Cape Henlopen , Delaware , with the strongest gales occurring after the eye passed over the area . 
 Upon making landfall on Cape May , New Jersey , the cyclone produced a 5 foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) storm surge on the Delaware Bay side of the city . Lasting for several hours , the hurricane force winds were described as " [ blowing ] with great violence " , causing widespread devastation across the region . In Little Egg Harbor , its passage caused damage to the port . Strong winds reached as far inland as Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , where winds of over 40 mph ( 60 km / h ) downed trees and chimneys ; in the city , precipitation accrued to 3 @.@ 92 inches ( 99 @.@ 6 mm ) . Further to the north , the hurricane destroyed a windmill at Bergen Point , New Jersey . Though the hurricane struck at low tide , it produced a storm surge of over 29 feet ( 9 m ) along several portions of the New Jersey coastline , causing significant overwash . 
 The hurricane produced a storm surge of 13 feet ( 4 m ) in only one hour at Battery Park , a record only broken 191 years later by Hurricane Sandy . Manhattan Island was completely flooded to Canal Street ; one hurricane researcher remarked that the storm surge flooding would have been much worse , had the hurricane not struck at low tide . However , few deaths were reported in the city , since the flooding affected neighborhoods much less populated than today . The hurricane brought light rainfall as it passed New York City , though strong winds left severe damage across the city . High tides occurred along the Hudson River . Strong waves and winds blew many ships ashore along Long Island . One ship sank , killing 17 people . Along Long Island , the winds destroyed several buildings and left crops destroyed . 
 In New England , the hurricane produced widespread gale force winds , with damage greatest in Connecticut . The Black Rock Harbor Light in Black Rock , Connecticut , was destroyed on September 21 . Elsewhere in the state , the winds damaged or destroyed churches , houses and small buildings . Moderate crop damage to fruit was reported as well . Strong winds extended into eastern Massachusetts , though little damage was reported in the Boston area .

Although Ted does not believe him , he still tries to grow a mustache , which Stella laughs at ( a year earlier , Barney had made a ten @-@ dollar bet with Ted that he could get him to grow a mustache ) . Upset , Ted says he gives up , but Lily ( Alyson Hannigan ) tells him to try again , as Stella is interested in him , though she says she has not been to see her . It is then revealed that Marshall ( Jason Segel ) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted , and found out Stella had a crush on him . Happy that Stella is interested in him , Ted asks her out after his last session , but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter . 
 After a while , Ted realizes she didn 't actually say the word ' no ' , just that she didn 't have time , and so decides to take her out on a " two @-@ minute date " - to dinner at a table at the café next door to her practice and " the important parts " of Manos : The Hands of Fate at the electronics store two doors down , with help from Ranjit ( Marshall <unk> ) . The date goes well , and Stella promises to call if she ever has time . Finally , Abby sees Ted outside the clinic holding flowers he tried to give to Stella , and chases him down the street . She is then seen at the reception telling Barney about how he toyed with her emotions , after which they go out to have sex .

 " Ten Sessions " was written by series co @-@ creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas , and directed by Pamela Fryman . In early March 2008 , it was confirmed that singer Britney Spears would guest star on the show . Neil Patrick Harris was " shocked " that Spears was willing to " come and do some acting " , noting that she had not acted in a while . Spears 's last acting role was on Will & Grace in 2006 . Harris told Entertainment Tonight that the paparazzi would not be a problem , since the show is shot on the Fox secure lot . Before Sarah Chalke was given the role as Stella , Alicia Silverstone was originally set to guest star , but dropped out when her representatives feared she would be " overshadowed " by Spears . Co @-@ creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas " love " Silverstone and hoped she would eventually guest star on the show , although she never did . 
 Alyson Hannigan said that Spears " was so funny " and that she had " no idea she [ Spears ] had such great comic timing " . According to Jason Segel , Spears improvised a few lines that were " really good " and set " everyone laughing " . Spears was nominated for a People 's Choice Award in the Favorite Scene @-@ Stealing Guest Star category for her performance in the episode . " Ten Sessions " first aired on CBS in the United States on March 24 , 2008 . Spears 's wardrobe in the episode was put up for an online auction to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council . The auction began just after the episode aired and would be going on for a week . The yellow Nanette Lepore lace dress Spears wore in the episode was sold for US $ 1 @,@ 525 , and the embroidered rust dress was sold for US $ 1 @,@ 925 .

 In its original broadcast in the United States , " Ten Sessions " was watched by 10 @.@ 62 million viewers according to the Nielsen ratings . It attracted 1 million more viewers than the previous episode , and 2 @.@ 4 million more than the show 's average before the writer 's strike . The episode achieved a 4 @.@ 5 / 12 rating in the key 18 – 49 demographic among adults , and was the fourth highest @-@ rated show of the evening ; it subsequently achieved the show 's highest rating ever in the 18 – 49 demographic . Show co @-@ creator Bays later said that Britney Spears ' appearance greatly benefited ratings : " And by golly she put our show on the map . It can 't be overstated . Britney Spears rescued us from ever being on the bubble again . Thanks Britney ! " 
 Spears ' appearance was critically acclaimed by most critics . Linda Stasi of the New York Post asserted that Spears looked " slim [ ... ] trim and gorgeous " and that " her acting was nothing short of adorably believable " . Stasi concluded that Spears ' cameo was the highlight of " Ten Sessions " . David Hinckley of New York Daily News echoed similar sentiments , avouching that she " proved [ that ] she can act every bit as well as she can sing " . Michelle Zoromski of IGN argued however that while Spears ' appearance was a " nice change of pace from her latest public appearances " , it was nonetheless a " bit clunky and not as seamless as other guest roles have been on the show " . Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club was also less enthusiastic about the singer 's performance . Bowman opined : " The Big Britney Episode , as it will henceforth be known , wasn 't really much to get all <unk> over . You can say this for the [ How I Met Your Mother ] team : They tend to minimize the annoyance factor of their special guest stars . Britney was a sideshow , and she got her couple of laughs , but she didn 't hog the screen time . " 
 Similarly , " Ten Sessions " as a whole was well received by television critics . Bowman gave the episode a ' B ' grade , and was more critical of " Ten Sessions " . She expressed : " the timing wasn 't spot @-@ on all the way through ' Ten Sessions ' . The episode was slow starting , and as with many of the series ' ' Ted is a master of romance ' attempts , the two @-@ minute date seemed as likely to be annoying @-@ quirky as endearing @-@ quirky , if you were the one being wooed . I wanted to like it more than I did . Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs would have really liked it , ditzy romantic that she is . But no — it 's just an ounce heavy on the trying @-@ too @-@ hard scale . " In contrast , Zoromski gave the episode an 8 @.@ 9 out of ten , signifying a " great " rating . He thought that the episode was superior to the previous episode , adding that the show returned to full form .

 = Roberto Orci = 
 Roberto Gaston Orci ( born July 20 , 1973 ) is a Mexican @-@ American film and television screenwriter and producer . He began his longtime collaboration with Alex Kurtzman while at school in California . Together they have been employed on television series such as Hercules : The Legendary Journeys and Xena : Warrior Princess . In 2008 , together with J. J. Abrams , they created Fringe . In 2013 , they created Sleepy Hollow alongside Phillip <unk> . Orci and Kurtzman 's first film project was Michael Bay 's The Island , and due to that partnership they went on to write the scripts for the first three films of the Transformers film series . Orci first became a film producer with 2008 's Eagle Eye and again with 2009 's The Proposal . 
 He and Kurtzman since returned to working with Abrams on Mission : Impossible III and both Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness . Between 2005 and 2011 , Kurtzman and Orci 's film projects took revenues of more than $ 3 billion . In April 2014 , Orci and Kurtzman announced that they would only collaborate in television projects , and Orci worked on the third Star Trek film , Star Trek Beyond , until being replaced the following December . Orci created the television series Matador for the El Rey Network , but after this was initially renewed , it was cancelled at the end of the first season . Both Kurtzman and Orci continue to work as producers on the television series Limitless and Scorpion . Orci was awarded the Norman Lear Writer 's Award and the Raul Julia Award for Excellence , in addition to shared awards and nominations including The George Pal Memorial Award . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Orci was born in Mexico City on July 20 , 1973 , to a Mexican father and a Cuban mother . His mother immigrated to the United States with her parents after Fidel Castro came to power . Orci grew up in Mexico , and moved with his family to the United States at the age of 10 . He was raised in Texas , Los Angeles and Canada . He is the older brother of screenwriter @-@ producer J. R. Orci . 
 He met his longtime friend and collaborator Alex Kurtzman when both were 17 @-@ year @-@ old students at Crossroads , a privately funded school in Santa Monica , California . The first time they came across each other was in a film class , where they discovered each other 's love for movies and in particular the Steven Soderbergh film Sex , Lies , and Videotape . The duo found that they had a number of things in common , as Kurtzman had previously lived in Mexico City and the two could relate . Orci later called him a " honorary Hispanic " . Orci went on to attend the University of Texas at Austin . The duo got together once again , and began to write scripts . These included one called Misfortune Cookies which Orci described as " loosely autobiographical " , and Last Kiss , which Kurtzman said was their version of The Breakfast Club but was set in a lunatic asylum . 
 The duo modeled their relationship on writers Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond , but were much closer friends rather than just writing partners . They took the approach that they were in a band together and purposely studied teams to discover why they break up . Kurtzman later explained in 2009 that " One big thing that makes the wheels start to wobble is when someone feels that the contribution isn 't 50 @-@ 50 . We make sure we live up to the partnership . If we didn 't , we wouldn 't have lasted this long . "

 = = = Television and film screenwriting = = = 
 Orci and Kurtzman began their writing collaboration on the television series Hercules : The Legendary Journeys , after being hired by Sam Raimi . After actor Kevin Sorbo suffered a stroke , the duo were required to come up with inventive ideas to minimize his appearances on screen . Due to this work , they became show runners at the age of 24 . They were also involved in the sister @-@ series to Hercules , Xena : Warrior Princess . They sought to move to writing for a network @-@ based television series , but found this difficult . After receiving a series of negative responses , they met with J. J. Abrams who was starting work on Alias at the time . The meeting went well , and resulted in them working on the series . They would go on to work together again on the Fox science fiction series Fringe where all three were listed as co @-@ creators . 
 Orci and Kurtzman received their break in writing for films in 2004 , with the Michael Bay film The Island , for which they developed the spec script by Caspian Tredwell @-@ Owen . When Kurtzman and Orci first met Bay , he asked the pair " Why should I trust you ? " , to which Orci replied " You shouldn 't yet . Let 's see what happens . " While the film was not an overwhelming success , they were brought back for Bay 's following film , Transformers , after producer Steven Spielberg asked them to come in for a meeting . The movie took in $ 710 million at the box office . 
 Following their work on that film , the duo were brought in to revise the script for Zack Snyder 's Watchmen , in an uncredited capacity . They worked once more with Abrams , on Mission : Impossible III . When they collaborated once more with Bay for Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , they were under significant time pressures due to the 2007 – 08 Writers Guild of America strike . Kurtzman and Orci had two weeks to outline the film , and after the strike Bay had them moved into the Hotel Casa del Mar. The hotel was six blocks away from his office , enabling Bay to conduct surprise inspections . 
 In the period between 2005 and 2011 , the films written by Kurtzman and Orci grossed more than $ 3 billion , leading to Forbes describing them as " Hollywood 's secret weapons " . The busyness of their screenwriting careers required them to collaborate with other writers due to the number of projects they were involved in . For example , on Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , they teamed up with Ehren Kruger , who took over from them on the writing duties for the <unk> franchise from Transformers : Dark of the Moon onwards . 
 = = = Becoming a producer = = = 
 Orci 's first credit solely as a producer came with the film Eagle Eye , where he worked once again alongside Kurtzman . He said in an interview with the magazine Extra that he had previously been involved in productions where the producers had writing backgrounds and had looked to them for help , and he was happy to provide that same support to the writers on Eagle Eye . The director of the film , D. J. Caruso , praised the duo saying that " What 's unusually cool about them is that they have maintained the producer @-@ writer power that they earned in television and carried that over into the feature film area , and that is extremely rare . " Following their work on Eagle Eye , they were executive producers on the Sandra Bullock film , The Proposal . 
 Despite their film careers , Orci and Kurtzman continued to create television series . These included Sleepy Hollow , which they developed alongside Phillip <unk> . They pitched the series to a number of networks , and it was picked up by Fox . Orci took five years to bring the series Matador to television , with it originating from a conversation with his cousin Andrew . It was created for Robert Rodriguez 's El Rey Network , and Rodriguez 's one demand of the show was that he could direct the pilot episode . Orci later explained in an interview that it was an easy decision , and he needed to pretend to consider it . 
 Orci and Kurtzman also worked together as executive producers on the animated television series , Transformers : Prime , due to their involvement with the live action movies . Following the end of the series they were hopeful to be involved in a future animated series based on the premise , which Orci saw less like a reboot of the show and more of a continuation in a different guise . He felt that while Prime was sophisticated , there were concerns that it was leaving younger viewers behind because of its complexity and intensity . 
 = = = Star Trek reboot = = = 
 Orci and Kurtzman were asked to write the script for a new Star Trek film , but initially turned it down despite Orci being a fan of the series . Orci suggested rebooting the timeline as seen previously in the films and television series , and adding the return of Leonard Nimoy as Spock from Star Trek : The Original Series . He considered the first two films in the reboot series to be the origin story for the crew , and that the third film would start where the crew was at the beginning of Star Trek : The Original Series . Orci felt that the relationship between the James T. Kirk and the younger Spock was reflective of the partnership of himself and Kurtzman , he said that " We didn 't even realize we were writing about ourselves until we were halfway through the script , that was a little embarrassing . 
 Star Trek was the series ' biggest grossing film at the domestic box @-@ office in the United States , resulting in a sequel being greenlit by the studio and Kurtzman and Orci being asked to write it . The studio set aside a larger budget for the sequel , which was revealed by Orci in an interview with <unk> Orci ruled out the " hero quitting " staple of a second movie , which had featured in the Transformers sequel , saying that the crew of the Enterprise were committed and that type of story does not have to apply to all sequels . During the buildup to the film , called Star Trek Into Darkness , Orci was one of the production team who didn 't give much away about the villain in the film and denied that Benedict Cumberbatch was to play Khan Noonian Singh . 
 The criticism of the sequel resulted in Orci posting controversial comments on a Star Trek fan site . In response to a fan upset over Into Darkness , Orci called him a " shitty fan " . He later apologized and deactivated his Twitter account . 
 = = = Breakup of the partnership = = = 
 In April 2014 , Orci and Kurtzman confirmed to Variety that they are no longer going to work together on film projects but will still collaborate together on television . Kurtzman wanted to work on the Spider @-@ Man film franchise , while Orci was linked to the directorial role for Star Trek 3 . Orci confirmed later that year in July that he was not involved in the production of The Amazing Spider @-@ Man 3 alongside Kurtzman . Orci and Kurtzman 's K / O Paper Products continues to operate as a production company within CBS Television Studios , and has created the series Scorpion inspired by the life of Walter O 'Brien for the 2014 @-@ 15 season and Limitless was created for the 2015 @-@ 16 season from the 2011 film . 
 Prior to the split of Kurtzman and Orci , the duo were lined up to write the third film in the new Star Trek series . In May 2014 , <unk> and Paramount Pictures announced that Orci was to direct the third installment of the Star Trek reboot franchise , after Abrams moved on to direct Star Wars : The Force Awakens . This would have marked Orci 's directorial debut , and he was to write the script alongside co @-@ writers JD Payne and Patrick McKay . Due to his commitment to Star Trek 3 , he dropped out of a new Power Rangers film , for which he would have been executive producer . But on December 5 , it was announced he would no longer be directing the Star Trek film . He remains credited as a producer on the film , and was replaced by Doug Jung and cast member Simon Pegg as the script writers after Orci 's initial script was dropped . Orci was replaced as director by Justin Lin , who had previously directed films in The Fast and the Furious franchise . 
 Orci created Matador with the idea that the main character would be a " soccer player by day who is a spy by night " , and called him a " Latin James Bond " . The series was broadcast on the El Rey Network created by Robert Rodriguez . It was renewed for a second season shortly before the pilot was broadcast , which had been directed by Rodriguez . But following the production of the first season , the series was cancelled despite the earlier renewal . This decision was blamed on poor international sales . 
 = = Awards and accolades = = 
 The Hollywood Reporter listed Orci as one of the 50 most powerful Latinos in Hollywood of 2007 . His first solo accolade was the Norman Lear Writer 's Award at the Imagen Awards in 2009 . He described the experience of receiving an award without Kurtzman as " bizarre " . Orci has also been awarded the Raul Julia Award for Excellence by the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts . Together with Kurtzman , Orci won The George Pal Memorial Award at the 2010 Saturn Awards . 
 Orci and Kurtzman were both honored by the nonprofit organization Chrysalis , alongside Josh Lieberman and Katherine Pope at the Butterfly Ball on June 8 , 2013 . The organization raises money for homeless people and low @-@ income families , Orci said that " When you hear the life stories from people right here in our own community , who are clients at Chrysalis , and when you come to learn of their lowest moments and how Chrysalis has led to their proudest triumphs , it 's easy to see why this local organization is so impactful .

He underwent basic military training in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the Baltic Sea in Stralsund ( 1 April 1928 – 30 June 1928 ) . Hartenstein was then transferred to the training ship Niobe ( 1 July 1928 – 15 October 1928 ) , attaining the rank of Seekadett ( midshipman ) on 11 October 1928 . Following a 14 @-@ month stay on board the cruiser Emden ( 16 October 1928 – 3 January 1930 ) he advanced in rank to Fähnrich zur See ( officer cadet ) on 1 January 1930 . Emden at the time was under the command of Lothar von Arnauld de la <unk> , a U @-@ boat commander during World War I. Hartenstein then underwent a number of officer training courses at the Naval Academy at Mürwik , including navigational training cruises on the survey vessel Meteor , before transferring to the light cruiser Köln ( 1 October 1931 – 23 September 1934 ) . His stay on Köln was occasionally interrupted to attend further training courses at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel @-@ Wik . During this assignment on 30 January 1933 , the Nazi Party , under the leadership of Adolf Hitler , came to power in Germany , and began to rearm the navy . In 1935 , the Reichsmarine was renamed the Kriegsmarine .

 On his second patrol ( 19 January 1942 – 17 March 1942 ) Hartenstein commanded a wolfpack of U @-@ boats ( Gruppe Neuland — Group New Land ) during the Attack on Aruba in February 1942 , attacking an oil refinery . U @-@ 156 along with U @-@ 67 under the command of Günther Müller @-@ <unk> and U @-@ 502 under the command of Jürgen von Rosenstiel departed from Lorient under the protection of a pathfinder in the early morning of 19 January 1942 .

Besides U @-@ 156 , U @-@ 67 and U @-@ 502 , Gruppe Neuland also included the submarines U @-@ 129 under the command of Nicolai Clausen and U @-@ 161 under the command of Albrecht Achilles .

At 01 : 31 , U @-@ 156 surfaced in San Nicolaas Harbour some 1 @.@ 5 km ( 0 @.@ 81 nmi ; 0 @.@ 93 mi ) offshore and attacked the two British tankers at anchor . Hartenstein fired one torpedo from his bow tubes at Pedernales . The torpedo attack was successful and Pedernales was hit amidships . Loaded with crude oil , the steamer immediately burst into flames , killing eight of her 26 crewmen and wounding her captain Herbert McCall . Oranjestad then began to lift anchor and steam away but she was too late and was hit by a second torpedo fired from U @-@ 156 . She too burst into flames and sunk an hour later in about 70 m ( 230 ft ) of water . Fifteen of her 22 crewmen were killed . 
 At 03 : 13 , U @-@ 156 attacked the Texaco @-@ owned tanker SS Arkansas which was berthed at Eagle Beach next to the Arend / Eagle Refinery . Just one of the torpedoes struck Arkansas and partially sank her but the damage was moderate and caused no casualties . Commander Hartenstein then steamed further around Aruba and directed his men to take to the deck guns and prepare for a naval bombardment of the large oil tank of the Lago Oil and Transport Company The crew of the 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 naval gun forgot to remove the <unk> from the barrel , so when Hartenstein ordered them to fire , the gun blew up . Gunnery Officer Dietrich von dem Borne was wounded badly , one foot having been severed . His comrade and trigger man Heinrich <unk> was badly wounded as well and died several hours after the attack . Hartenstein ordered the 3 @.@ 7 cm flak gun to continue the attack , causing only superficial damage .

 On Hartenstein 's third patrol ( 22 April 1942 – 7 July 1942 ) , U @-@ 156 sank 12 ships and damaged a further two , including the USS Blakeley on 25 May 1942 . This achievement earned Hartenstein a reference on 6 June 1942 in the Wehrmachtbericht ( armed forces report ) , an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht . To be singled out individually in this way was an honour ( equivalent to " Mentioned in Despatches " in the United Kingdom military ) and was entered in the Orders and Decorations ' section of a soldier 's Service Record Book . 
 U @-@ 156 along with U @-@ 502 again departed from Lorient under the protection of a pathfinder on 22 April 1942 destined for the Caribbean Sea . Prior to the departure Dietrich von dem Borne , who had been severely wounded on the second patrol , was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See of the Reserve Gert Mannesmann . Chief engineer Wilhelm <unk> reported to Hartenstein on 6 May that the diesel compressor had malfunctioned . Hartenstein radioed U @-@ 66 under the command of Robert @-@ Richard Zapp to assist . On 10 May U @-@ 156 and U @-@ 66 rendezvoused and exchanged 5 cubic metres ( 6 @.@ 5 cu yd ) of fuel oil for the necessary spare parts , and the fuel compressor was repaired . U @-@ 156 sighted the first steamer in the early afternoon on 12 May , the first of twelve ships — eleven merchantmen and one warship — attacked on this patrol , ten of which were sunk . 
 U @-@ 156 , positioned near Fort @-@ de @-@ France , was ordered to observe the traffic to and from Martinique . At roughly 11 nautical miles ( 20 km ; 13 mi ) offshore , the hydrophones detected a ship . Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position firing two torpedoes . One torpedo struck the bow of the Blakeley after a 25 @-@ second run @-@ time . Hartenstein observed that the bow was completely blown away , but its engines kept running . The waters around Martinique were extremely shallow and Hartenstein decided not to pursue the destroyer . On 1 June 1942 , Hartenstein was promoted to Korvettenkapitän ( corvette captain ) . The first watch officer , Paul Just , left U @-@ 156 after returning from the third patrol . Just was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See Leopold Schumacher as new first watch officer . Just later became commander of U @-@ 6 , U @-@ 151 and U @-@ 546 . 
 Hartenstein and the entire crew of U @-@ 156 received a hero 's welcome by the people of Plauen on 20 July 1942 . The people lined the streets as the whole crew marched from the railway station to the City Hall for the official welcome reception . 
 = = = Fourth patrol and Laconia incident = = = 
 On U @-@ 156 's fourth patrol ( 20 August 1942 – 16 November 1942 ) , Hartenstein sank and then organised the rescue of the survivors of RMS Laconia , resulting in the " Laconia incident " and " Laconia order " . 
 U @-@ 156 together with U @-@ 68 under the command of Karl @-@ Friedrich Merten departed from Lorient on 20 August 1942 heading for the Bay of Biscay . Hartenstein received the order to operate against Convoy SL @-@ 119 on 25 August . After a two @-@ day pursuit , U @-@ 156 found a straggler , the SS Clan <unk> , west of Casablanca . Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position to avoid detection under the bright moonlight . Clan <unk> was hit by two torpedoes and sank , killing nine members of the crew and two gunners ; 79 sailors survived the sinking . Two later sightings on 2 and 6 September did not lead to favourable attack positions . 
 On 12 September 1942 U @-@ 156 was patrolling off the coast of West Africa midway between Liberia and Ascension Island roughly 600 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ; 690 mi ) south of Cape Palmas . At 11 : 37 the aft port lookout sighted a smoke stack at 230 degrees . Hartenstein followed the target , which was zigzagging at 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) , until the general direction of the large ocean liner became evident . U @-@ 156 was running at 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) into a favourable attack position , and Hartenstein ordered the attack at 21 : 07 . He slowed speed at 22 : 00 and ordered surfaced deflection shots from torpedo tubes I and III . After three minutes and six seconds the first torpedo detonated , then the second . He had hoped to capture the ship 's senior officers , but to his surprise , Hartenstein saw over two thousand people struggling in the water . Hartenstein immediately began rescue operations . Laconia sank at 23 : 23 . 
 At 01 : 25 on 13 September 1942 Hartenstein radioed the Befehlshaber der U @-@ Boote ( BdU — commander of U @-@ boats ) requesting guidance and confirmation on how to proceed . The BdU responded at 03 : 45 ordering Wolf pack Eisbär , consisting of U @-@ 507 under the command of <unk> Schacht , U @-@ 506 under the command of Erich Würdemann and U @-@ 459 under the command of Georg von <unk> @-@ <unk> , to assist Hartenstein immediately . At 06 : 00 Hartenstein ordered that the following message be sent on the 25m wavelength : 
 " If any ship will assist the ship @-@ wrecked Laconia crew , I will not attack providing I am not being attacked by ship or air forces . I picked up 193 men . 4 ° 53 South / 11 ° 26 West – German submarine " 
 The message was repeated twice on the international 600m wavelength . The BdU later changed the order slightly and U @-@ 506 , U @-@ 507 and the Italian submarine <unk> were dispatched . In parallel U @-@ 156 was assisting and supplying the survivors in the numerous lifeboats that kept arriving or were picked up . U @-@ 506 arrived at 11 : 32 on 14 September 1942 , followed by U @-@ 507 in the afternoon of 15 September . Heading to a rendezvous with Vichy French ships under Red Cross banners , the U @-@ boats were attacked by a U.S. Army B @-@ 24 Liberator bomber ( 343d Bomb Squadron ; Lieutenant James D. Harden ) at 12 : 32 on 16 September 1942 . The attack ordered by Captain Robert C. Richardson III , which killed a number of people in the lifeboats and damaged U @-@ 156 , forced Hartenstein to abandon the rescue operations . A majority of survivors were later rescued by British merchant ships and two Vichy French warships , the cruiser Gloire and the sloop Annamite , out of Dakar , Africa . 
 This event later became known as the " Laconia incident " and led BdU Admiral Karl Dönitz to issue the " Laconia order " to his U @-@ boat commanders that stated in part " No attempt of any kind must be made at rescuing members of ships sunk ... " At the end of the war , the Laconia Order was unsuccessfully used against Admiral Dönitz in his war crime trial . The prosecution failed when Fleet Admiral Nimitz testified that in the war with Japan the United States Navy had followed the same general policy as was set forth in the German admiral 's directive . 
 U @-@ 156 received a radio message on 17 September 1942 indicating that Werner Hartenstein had become the 63rd member of the U @-@ boat service and the 125th of the Kriegsmarine to be awarded Germany 's highest military honour , the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross . Hartenstein issued a bottle of beer to each member of the crew and held a speech honouring the achievements of everyone on board , and telling them that he would wear the decoration in their name . 
 On 19 September 1942 , U @-@ 156 was roughly 800 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 500 km ; 920 mi ) south of Freetown and the crew was still repairing minor damage , when the lookout spotted a ship at 04 : 30 . The target was the British ship Quebec City , en route from Cape Town to Freetown . Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position and hit Quebec City with one torpedo fired from tube VI . Hartenstein surfaced and approached the lifeboats and asked the survivors for the ship 's name . Quebec City did not sink easily and U @-@ 156 fired 58 rounds from the 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 46 in ) flak gun and seven further shots from the 10 @.@ 5 cm gun before Hartenstein ordered a cease fire . After a direct hit in the ship 's stern ammunition magazine and an explosion , Quebec City slowly sank . According to William Clark , a member of Quebec City 's crew , Hartenstein made sure that the survivors had enough water and provisions and that Captain William Thomas had the exact coordinates . This account of that attack and the impression that the humanitarian actions of Hartenstein made is documented in the book by David <unk> Jones , The Enemy We Killed , My Friend . Jones himself disagrees , stating that Hartenstein was concerned about the survivors ’ well @-@ being but did not inquire about provisions , nor did he offer additional food or water . Hartenstein did express that it would have been his wish to tow them at least some distance to the African coast , but explained that he was not able to do so as he recently had been attacked while attempting to aid survivors .

 During his fifth patrol ( 16 January 1943 – 8 March 1943 ) , on 8 March 1943 , Hartenstein and the entire crew of U @-@ 156 were killed in action by depth charges from a US PBY Catalina aircraft ( VP @-@ 53 / P @-@ 1 ; Lieutenant E. Dryden ) , east of Barbados . The Catalina dropped four Mark 44 Torpex water @-@ bombs at 13 : 15 from an altitude of 75 feet ( 23 m ) to 100 feet ( 30 m ) which straddled U @-@ 156 . Two bombs were observed to hit the water 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) to 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) starboard and just aft of U @-@ 156 , lifting it and breaking it in two , followed by an explosion . At least eleven survivors were seen swimming in the water . The Americans dropped two rubber rafts and rations , and five men were seen to reach one of the rafts . The USS Barney was dispatched from Trinidad to rescue the survivors . The search was abandoned on 12 March 1943 . Korvettenkapitän Ernst <unk> , chief of the 2nd U @-@ boat Flotilla at Lorient , sent a letter to Hartenstein 's parents on 23 April 1943 indicating that their son had been posted as missing in action as of 12 March 1943 . US officials announced the destruction of the U @-@ boat on 10 May 1943 . 
 Ten months after his death a service of remembrance was held in Plauen on 15 January 1944 . The service was attended by his parents , his sisters and other members of the family , the mayor of Plauen , Eugen Wörner , senior officials and councillors . The local press reported that " His parents have accepted that their loving son will not return home but is resting in peace with his Lord . " Werner Hartenstein was portrayed by German actor Ken <unk> in the 2011 TV mini @-@ series The Sinking of the Laconia .

 " Flying the Flag ( For You ) " is a song performed by British pop / bubblegum dance group Scooch . 
 The song was entered and won the British national selection competition for the Eurovision Song Contest , Eurovision : Making Your Mind Up in 2007 , and subsequently represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki , Finland . The song came joint 22nd with a total of 19 points , the same score as France . 
 = = Song information = = 
 Scooch had reformed in hope of performing at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , and the song was specifically written for the Contest ; Eurovision rules state that the song must be an original composition and released no more than seven months before the contest . Russ , as the captain , opens and closes the song with captain 's announcements . Natalie and Caroline sing the vocals of the song , as David offers passengers confectioneries . The lyrics are heavily based on actual experiences of flying . The song contains a liberal amount of sexual innuendo , the most overt being " ... and blow into the mouthpiece " and " Would you like something to suck on for landing , sir ? " ( the latter was omitted or changed for some tea @-@ time television performances ) . The camp style was both praised and criticised - The Guardian noted that the song was , in terms of Eurovision , outdated and similar to Buck 's Fizz 's winning entry in 1981 , while Tim Moore called the song " a fine song in Eurovision tradition " . 
 = = Music video = = 
 The original music video was their final performance on Eurovision : Making Your Mind Up ; Scooch recorded a new version once their contract with Warner Bros. had been signed . Following the lyrics , the second video starts with the quartet in the front of the aeroplane , with Spencer as the captain . The video continues with all of the members as stewards walking up and down the plane , with a cameo appearance from Sister Mary McArthur , who was invited to take part after the band saw her lip sync video . Later in the video each member of the band is seen dancing in front of the flags of selected countries that are all participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , in addition to the flag of the European Union .

 " Flying the Flag ( for You ) " was the nineteenth song to be sung during the Eurovision Song Contest . The song scored only nineteen points : twelve from Malta , and seven from Ireland , two nations known for awarding points to the United Kingdom - although according to the Head of the Maltese Delegation , Malta voted twelve partly in protest to regional block voting which , had made the Contest " not about the songs any more " , an opinion shared by " five or six other countries " . Due to the low score that Scooch had received — only Ireland were lower on the scoreboard — the song received negative press by newspapers - in particular , The Sunday Mirror were reported by the BBC to have stated that the song made the United Kingdom " the laughing stock of Europe " , The Sunday Times , according to the BBC , referred to the song , " It wasn 't a disaster - more of a crash landing " .

 On 18 April 2007 it was announced that Scooch had been signed to the Warner Bros. label .

 = Spanish conquest of Yucatán = 
 The Spanish conquest of Yucatán was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Maya states and polities in the Yucatán Peninsula , a vast limestone plain covering south @-@ eastern Mexico , northern Guatemala , and all of Belize . The Spanish conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula was hindered by its politically fragmented state . The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish . Among the Maya , ambush was a favoured tactic . Spanish weaponry included broadswords , rapiers , lances , pikes , halberds , crossbows , matchlocks and light artillery . Maya warriors fought with flint @-@ tipped spears , bows and arrows and stones , and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves . The Spanish introduced a number of Old World diseases previously unknown in the Americas , initiating devastating plagues that swept through the native populations . 
 The first encounter with the Yucatán Maya occurred in 1502 , when the fourth voyage of Christopher Columbus came across a large Maya trading canoe off Honduras . In 1517 , Francisco Hernández de Córdoba made landfall on the tip of the peninsula . His expedition continued along the coast and suffered heavy losses in a pitched battle at Champotón , forcing a retreat to Cuba . Juan de Grijalva explored the coast in 1518 , and heard tales of the wealthy Aztec Empire further west . As a result of these rumours , Hernán Cortés set sail with another fleet . From Cozumel he continued around the peninsula to Tabasco where he fought a battle at Potonchán ; from there Cortés continued onward to conquer the Aztec Empire . In 1524 , Cortés led a sizeable expedition to Honduras , cutting across southern Campeche , and through Petén in what is now northern Guatemala . In 1527 Francisco de Montejo set sail from Spain with a small fleet . He left garrisons on the east coast , and subjugated the northeast of the peninsula . Montejo then returned to the east to find his garrisons had almost been eliminated ; he used a supply ship to explore southwards before looping back around the entire peninsula to central Mexico . Montejo pacified Tabasco with the aid of his son , also named Francisco de Montejo . 
 In 1531 the Spanish moved their base of operations to Campeche , where they repulsed a significant Maya attack . After this battle , the Spanish founded a town at Chichen Itza in the north . Montejo carved up the province amongst his soldiers . In mid @-@ 1533 the local Maya rebelled and laid siege to the small Spanish garrison , which was forced to flee . Towards the end of 1534 , or the beginning of 1535 , the Spanish retreated from Campeche to Veracruz . In 1535 , peaceful attempts by the Franciscan Order to incorporate Yucatán into the Spanish Empire failed after a renewed Spanish military presence at Champotón forced the friars out . Champotón was by now the last Spanish outpost in Yucatán , isolated among a hostile population . In 1541 – 42 the first permanent Spanish town councils in the entire peninsula were founded at Campeche and Mérida . When the powerful lord of Mani converted to the Roman Catholic religion , his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity encouraged the lords of the western provinces to accept Spanish rule . In late 1546 an alliance of eastern provinces launched an unsuccessful uprising against the Spanish . The eastern Maya were defeated in a single battle , which marked the final conquest of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula . 
 The polities of Petén in the south remained independent and received many refugees fleeing from Spanish jurisdiction . In 1618 and in 1619 two unsuccessful Franciscan missions attempted the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza . In 1622 the Itza slaughtered two Spanish parties trying to reach their capital Nojpetén . These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695 . Over the course of 1695 and 1696 a number of Spanish expeditions attempted to reach Nojpetén from the mutually independent Spanish colonies in Yucatán and Guatemala . In early 1695 the Spanish began to build a road from Campeche south towards Petén and activity intensified , sometimes with significant losses on the part of the Spanish . Martín de Urzúa y Arizmendi , governor of Yucatán , launched an assault upon Nojpetén in March 1697 ; the city fell after a brief battle . With the defeat of the Itza , the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the Spanish . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Yucatán Peninsula is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the east and by the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west . It can be delimited by a line running from the Laguna de Términos on the Gulf coast through to the Gulf of Honduras on the Caribbean coast . It incorporates the modern Mexican states of Yucatán , Quintana Roo and Campeche , the eastern portion of the state of Tabasco , most of the Guatemalan department of Petén , and all of Belize . Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline . A 15 @-@ kilometre ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) stretch of high , rocky coast runs south from the city of Campeche on the Gulf Coast . A number of bays are situated along the east coast of the peninsula , from north to south they are Ascensión Bay , Espíritu Santo Bay , Chetumal Bay and Amatique Bay . The north coast features a wide , sandy littoral zone . The extreme north of the peninsula , roughly corresponding to Yucatán State , has underlying bedrock consisting of flat Cenozoic limestone . To the south of this the limestone rises to form the low chain of Puuc Hills , with a steep initial scarp running 160 kilometres ( 99 mi ) east from the Gulf coast near Champotón , terminating some 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) from the Caribbean coast near the border of Quintana Roo . The hills reach a maximum altitude of 170 metres ( 560 ft ) . 
 The northwestern and northern portions of the Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall than the rest of the peninsula ; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water . This limestone geology results in most rainwater filtering directly through the bedrock to the phreatic zone , from whence it slowly flows to the coasts to form large submarine springs . Various freshwater springs rise along the coast to form watering holes . The filtering of rainwater through the limestone has caused the formation of extensive cave systems . These cave <unk> are subject to collapse forming deep sinkholes ; if the bottom of the cave is deeper than the groundwater level then a <unk> is formed . 
 In contrast , the northeastern portion of the peninsula is characterised by forested swamplands . The northern portion of the peninsula lacks rivers , except for the Champotón River – all other rivers are located in the south . The <unk> River flows from west to east from south central Quintana Roo to Lake Bacalar on the Caribbean Coast ; the Río Hondo flows northwards from Belize to empty into the same lake . Bacalar Lake empties into Chetumal Bay . The Río Nuevo flows from Lamanai Lake in Belize northwards to Chetumal Bay . The Mopan River and the Macal River flow through Belize and join to form the Belize River , which empties into the Caribbean Sea . In the southwest of the peninsula , the San Pedro River , the <unk> River and the <unk> River , which all form a part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage . 
 The Petén region consists of densely forested low @-@ lying limestone plain featuring karstic topography . The area is crossed by low east – west oriented ridges of Cenozoic limestone and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types ; water sources include generally small rivers and low @-@ lying seasonal swamps known as bajos . A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Petén ; during the rainy season some of these lakes become interconnected . This drainage area measures approximately 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) east – west by 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) north – south . The largest lake is Lake Petén Itza , near the centre of the drainage basin ; it measures 32 by 5 kilometres ( 19 @.@ 9 by 3 @.@ 1 mi ) . A broad savannah extends south of the central lakes . To the north of the lakes region bajos become more frequent , interspersed with forest . In the far north of Petén the Mirador Basin forms another interior drainage region . To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands . The canopy height of the forest gradually decreases from Petén northwards , averaging from 25 to 35 metres ( 82 to 115 ft ) . This dense forest covers northern Petén and Belize , most of <unk> Roo , southern Campeche and a portion of the south of Yucatán State . Further north , the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub .

 The climate becomes progressively drier towards the north of the peninsula . In the north , the annual mean temperature is 27 ° C ( 81 ° F ) in Mérida . Average temperature in the peninsula varies from 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) in January to 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) in July . The lowest temperature on record is 6 ° C ( 43 ° F ) . For the peninsula as a whole , the mean annual precipitation is 1 @,@ 100 millimetres ( 43 in ) . The rainy season lasts from June to September , while the dry season runs from October to May . During the dry season , rainfall averages 300 millimetres ( 12 in ) ; in the wet season this increases to an average 800 to 900 millimetres ( 31 to 35 in ) . The prevailing winds are easterly and have created an east @-@ west precipitation gradient with average rainfall in the east exceeding 1 @,@ 400 millimetres ( 55 in ) and the north and northwestern portions of the peninsula receiving a maximum of 800 millimetres ( 31 in ) . The southeastern portion of the peninsula has a tropical rainy climate with a short dry season in winter . 
 Petén has a hot climate and receives the highest rainfall in all Mesoamerica . The climate is divided into wet and dry seasons , with the rainy season lasting from June to December , although these seasons are not clearly defined in the south ; with rain occurring through most of the year . The climate of Petén varies from tropical in the south to semitropical in the north ; temperature varies between 12 and 40 ° C ( 54 and 104 ° F ) , although it does not usually drop beneath 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) . Mean temperature varies from 24 @.@ 3 ° C ( 75 @.@ 7 ° F ) in the southeast to 26 @.@ 9 ° C ( 80 @.@ 4 ° F ) in the northeast .

 = = Yucatán before the conquest = = 
 The first large Maya cities developed in the Petén Basin in the far south of the Yucatán Peninsula as far back as the Middle Preclassic ( c . 600 – 350 BC ) , and Petén formed the heartland of the ancient Maya civilization during the Classic period ( c . AD 250 – 900 ) . The 16th century Maya provinces of northern Yucatán are likely to have evolved out of polities of the Maya Classic period . From the mid @-@ 13th century AD through to the mid @-@ 15th century , the League of <unk> united several of the northern provinces ; for a time they shared a joint form of government . The great cities that dominated Petén had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century AD with the onset of the Classic Maya collapse . A significant Maya presence remained in Petén into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities ; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources . 
 In the early 16th century , when the Spanish discovered the Yucatán Peninsula , the region was still dominated by the Maya civilization . It was divided into a number of independent provinces referred to as <unk> ( plural kuchkabaloob ) in the Yucatec Maya language . The various provinces shared a common culture but the internal sociopolitical organisation varied from one province to the next , as did access to important resources . These differences in political and economic makeup often led to hostilities between the provinces . The politically fragmented state of the Yucatán Peninsula at the time of conquest hindered the Spanish invasion , since there was no central political authority to be overthrown . However , the Spanish were also able to exploit this fragmentation by taking advantage of pre @-@ existing rivalries between polities . Estimates of the number of <unk> in the northern Yucatán vary from sixteen to twenty @-@ four . The boundaries between polities were not stable , being subject to the effects of alliances and wars ; those kuchkabaloob with more centralised forms of government were likely to have had more stable boundaries than those of loose confederations of provinces . When the Spanish discovered Yucatán , the provinces of Mani and Sotuta were two of the most important polities in the region . They were mutually hostile ; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish , while the <unk> Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers . 
 At the time of conquest , polities in the north included Mani , Cehpech and Chakan . Chakan was largely landlocked with a small stretch of coast on the north of the peninsula . Cehpech was a coastal province to its east ; further east along the north coast were Ah Kin Chel , Cupul , and Chikinchel . The modern city of Valladolid is situated upon the site of the former capital of Cupul . Cupul and <unk> are known to have been mutually hostile , and to have engaged in wars to control the salt beds of the north coast . <unk> was a small landlocked province south of Chikinchel . Ecab was a large province in the east . Uaymil was in the southeast , and Chetumal was to the south of it ; all three bordered on the Caribbean Sea . Cochuah was also in the eastern half of the peninsula ; it was southwest of Ecab and northwest of Uaymil . Its borders are poorly understood and it may have been landlocked , or have extended to occupy a portion of the Caribbean coast between the latter two kuchkabaloob . The capital of Cochuah was <unk> . <unk> and Sotuta were landlocked provinces north of Mani and southwest of Ah Kin Chel and Cupul . Ah Canul was the northernmost province on the Gulf coast of the peninsula . <unk> ( modern Campeche ) was to the south of it , followed by Chanputun ( modern Champotón ) . South of Chanputun , and extending west along the Gulf coast was Acalan . This Chontal Maya @-@ speaking province extended east of the Usumacinta River in Tabasco , as far as what is now the southern portion of Campeche state , where their capital was located . In the southern portion of the peninsula , a number of polities occupied the Petén Basin . The Kejache occupied a territory to the north of the Itza and east of Acalan , between the Petén lakes and what is now Campeche , and to the west of Chetumal . The Cholan Maya @-@ speaking Lakandon ( not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name ) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Petén in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas . The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish . 
 Although there is insufficient data to accurately estimate population sizes at the time of contact with the Spanish , early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Petén , particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers . Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Petén and parts of Belize . The Itza were warlike , and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies . Their capital was Nojpetén , an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá ; it has developed into the modern town of Flores , which is the capital of the Petén department of Guatemala . The Itza spoke a variety of Yucatecan Maya . The Kowoj were the second in importance ; they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours . The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza , around the eastern Petén lakes : Lake Salpetén , Lake Macanché , Lake Yaxhá and Lake Sacnab . The Yalain appear to have been one of the three dominant polities in Postclassic central Petén , alongside the Itza and the Kowoj . The Yalain territory had its maximum extension from the east shore of Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj in Belize . In the 17th century the Yalain capital was located at the site of that name on the north shore of Lake Macanché . At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza , an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups . In the late 17th century , Spanish colonial records document hostilities between Maya groups in the lakes region , with the incursion of the Kowoj into former Yalain sites including <unk> on Lake Macanché and <unk> on Lake Salpetén . Other groups in Petén are less well known , and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure ; among them were the Chinamita , the Icaiche , the Kejache , the Lakandon Ch 'ol , the Manche Ch 'ol , and the Mopan . 
 = = Impact of Old World diseases = = 
 A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and thus initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas . The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas also severely affected the various Maya groups of the entire Yucatán Peninsula . Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75 % to 90 % mortality . The terrible plagues that swept the peninsula were recorded in Yucatec Maya written histories , which combined with those of neighbouring Maya peoples in the Guatemalan Highlands , suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area the same year that it arrived in central Mexico with the forces under the command of Pánfilo Narváez . Old World diseases are often mentioned only briefly in indigenous accounts , making it difficult to identify the exact culprit . Among the most deadly were the aforementioned smallpox , influenza , measles and a number of pulmonary diseases , including tuberculosis ; the latter disease was attributed to the arrival of the Spanish by the Maya inhabitants of Yucatán . 
 These diseases swept through Yucatán in the 1520s and 1530s , with periodic recurrences throughout the 16th century . By the late 16th century , the reports of high fevers suggest the arrival of malaria in the region , and yellow fever was first reported in the mid @-@ 17th century , with a terse mention in the Chilam Balam of <unk> for 1648 . That particular outbreak was traced back to the island of Guadaloupe in the Caribbean , from whence it was introduced to the port city of Campeche , and from there was transmitted to Mérida . Mortality was high , with approximately 50 % of the population of some Yucatec Maya settlements being wiped out . Sixteen Franciscan friars are reported to have died in Mérida , probably the majority of the Franciscans based there at the time , and who had probably numbered not much more than twenty before the outbreak . Those areas of the peninsula that experience damper conditions , particularly those possessing swamplands , became rapidly depopulated after the conquest with the introduction of malaria and other waterborne parasites . An example was the one @-@ time well @-@ populated province of Ecab occupying the northeastern portion of the peninsula . In 1528 , when Francisco de Montejo occupied the town of Conil for two months , the Spanish recorded approximately 5 @,@ 000 houses in the town ; the adult male population at the time has been conservatively estimated as 3 @,@ 000 . By 1549 , Spanish records show that only 80 tributaries were registered to be taxed , indicating a population drop in Conil of more than 90 % in 21 years . The native population of the northeastern portion of the peninsula was almost completely eliminated within fifty years of the conquest . 
 In the south , conditions conducive to the spread of malaria existed throughout Petén and Belize . At the time of the fall of Nojpetén in 1697 , there are estimated to have been 60 @,@ 000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá , including a large number of refugees from other areas . It is estimated that 88 % of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war . Likewise , in Tabasco the population of approximately 30 @,@ 000 was reduced by an estimated 90 % , with measles , smallpox , catarrhs , dysentery and fevers being the main culprits . 
 = = Weaponry , strategies and tactics = = 
 The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns , or reducciones ( also known as congregaciones ) . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish . Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases . An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan , which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco . When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10 @,@ 000 . In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4 @,@ 000 . In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast , so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities . In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute @-@ paying inhabitants of Tixchel , which probably had a total population of about 1 @,@ 100 . This indicates a 90 % drop in population over a 36 @-@ year span . Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest , while others had succumbed to disease , malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción . Coastal reducciones , while convenient for Spanish administration , were vulnerable to pirate attacks ; in the case of Tixchel , pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche . Among the Maya , ambush was a favoured tactic .

 On 30 July 1502 , during his fourth voyage , Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja , one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras . He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island . As Bartholomew explored the island with two boats , a large canoe approached from the west , apparently en route to the island . The canoe was carved from one large tree trunk and was powered by twenty @-@ five naked rowers . Curious as to the visitors , Bartholomew Columbus seized and boarded it . He found it was a Maya trading canoe from Yucatán , carrying well @-@ dressed Maya and a rich cargo that included ceramics , cotton textiles , yellow stone axes , flint @-@ studded war clubs , copper axes and bells , and cacao . Also among the cargo were a small number of women and children , probably destined to be sold as slaves , as were a number of the rowers . The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter ; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way . This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya . It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes – the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan , the northern Maya feathered serpent god , were probably recorded around this time , and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam . 
 In 1511 the Spanish caravel Santa María de la Barca set sail along the Central American coast under the command of Pedro de Valdivia . The ship was sailing to Santo Domingo from Darién to inform the colonial authorities there of ongoing conflict between conquistadors Diego de <unk> and Vasco Nuñez de Balboa in Darién . The ship foundered upon a reef known as Las <unk> ( " The Vipers " ) or , alternatively , Los Alacranes ( " The Scorpions " ) , somewhere off Jamaica . There were just twenty survivors from the wreck , including Captain Valdivia , Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero . They set themselves adrift in one of the ship 's boats , with bad oars and no sail ; after thirteen days during which half of the survivors died , they made landfall upon the coast of Yucatán . There they were seized by Halach Uinik , a Maya lord . Captain <unk> was sacrificed with four of his companions , and their flesh was served at a feast . Aguilar and Guerrero were held prisoner and fattened for killing , together with five or six of their shipmates . Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape their captors and fled to a neighbouring lord who was an enemy of Halach Uinik ; he took them prisoner and kept them as slaves . After a time , Gonzalo Guerrero was passed as a slave to the lord Nachan Can of Chetumal . Guerrero became completely <unk> and served his new lord with such loyalty that he was married to one of Nachan Chan 's daughters , <unk> Ha , by whom he had three children . By 1514 , Guerrero had achieved the rank of <unk> , a war leader who served against Nachan Chan 's enemies . 
 = = Francisco Hernández de Córdoba , 1517 = = 
 In 1517 , Francisco Hernández de Córdoba set sail from Cuba with a small fleet , consisting of two caravels and a brigantine , with the dual intention of exploration and of rounding up slaves . The experienced Antón de Alaminos served as pilot ; he had previously served as pilot under Christopher Columbus on his final voyage . Also among the approximately 100 @-@ strong expedition members was Bernal Díaz del Castillo . The expedition sailed west from Cuba for three weeks , and weathered a two @-@ day storm a week before sighting the coast of the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula . The ships could not put in close to the shore due to the shallowness of the coastal waters . However , they could see a Maya city some two leagues inland , upon a low hill . The Spanish called it Gran Cairo ( literally " Great Cairo " ) due to its size and its pyramids . Although the location is not now known with certainty , it is believed that this first sighting of Yucatán was at Isla Mujeres . 
 The following morning , the Spanish sent the two ships with a shallower draught to find a safe approach through the shallows . The caravels anchored about one league from the shore . Ten large canoes powered by both sails and oars rowed out to meet the Spanish ships . Over thirty Maya boarded the vessels and mixed freely with the Spaniards . The Maya visitors accepted gifts of beads , and the leader indicated with signs that they would return to take the Spanish ashore the following day . 
 The Maya leader returned the following day with twelve canoes , as promised . The Spanish could see from afar that the shore was packed with natives . The conquistadors put ashore in the brigantine and the ships ' boats ; a few of the more daring Spaniards boarded the native canoes . The Spanish named the headland Cape Catoche , after some words spoken by the Maya leader , which sounded to the Spanish like cones <unk> . Once ashore , the Spaniards clustered loosely together and advanced towards the city along a path among low , scrub @-@ covered hillocks . At this point the Maya leader gave a shout and the Spanish party was ambushed by Maya warriors armed with spears , bows and arrows , and stones . Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault , but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack . They advanced to a small plaza bordered by temples upon the outskirts of the city . When the Spaniards ransacked the temples they found a number of low @-@ grade gold items , which filled them with enthusiasm . The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships . Over the following days the Spanish discovered that although the Maya arrows had struck with little force , the flint arrowheads tended to shatter on impact , causing infected wounds and a slow death ; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow @-@ wounds inflicted in the ambush . 
 Over the next fifteen days the fleet slowly followed the coastline west , and then south . The casks brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water ; the hunt for more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced , and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows . On 23 February 1517 , the day of Saint Lazarus , another city was spotted and named San Lázaro by the Spanish – it is now known by its original Maya name , Campeche . A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships ' boats to fill their water casks in a freshwater pool . They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats ; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs . The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city . They were led amongst large buildings until they stood before a blood @-@ caked altar , where many of the city 's inhabitants crowded around . The Indians piled reeds before the visitors ; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint , followed by ten Maya priests . The Maya set fire to the reeds and indicated that the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time the reeds had been consumed . The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships . 
 The small fleet continued for six more days in fine weather , followed by four stormy days . By this time water was once again dangerously short . The ships spotted an inlet close to another city , Champotón , and a landing party discovered fresh water . Armed Maya warriors approached from the city while the water casks were being filled . Communication was once again attempted with signs . Night fell by the time the water casks had been filled and the attempts at communication concluded . In the darkness the Spaniards could hear the movements of large numbers of Maya warriors . They decided that a night @-@ time retreat would be too risky ; instead , they posted guards and waited for dawn . At sunrise , the Spanish saw that they had been surrounded by a sizeable army . The massed Maya warriors launched an assault with missiles , including arrows , darts and stones ; they then charged into hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with spears and clubs . Eighty of the defenders were wounded in the initial barrage of missiles , and two Spaniards were captured in the frantic mêlée that followed . All of the Spanish party received wounds , including Hernández de Córdoba . The Spanish regrouped in a defensive formation and forced passage to the shore , where their discipline collapsed and a frantic scramble for the boats ensued , leaving the Spanish vulnerable to the pursuing Maya warriors who waded into the sea behind them . Most of the precious water casks were abandoned on the beach . When the surviving Spanish reached the safety of the ships , they realised that they had lost over fifty men , more than half their number . Five men died from their wounds in the following days . The battle had lasted only an hour , and the Spanish named the locale as the Coast of the Disastrous Battle . They were now far from help and low on supplies ; too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba . They decided to abandon their smallest ship , the brigantine , although it was purchased on credit from Governor Velásquez of Cuba . 
 The few men who had not been wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were reinforced with three men who had suffered relatively minor wounds ; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water . They found some and brought it back to the ships , although it sickened those who drank it . The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights ; Alaminos , the pilot , then steered a course for Florida , where they found good drinking water , although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died . The ships finally made port in Cuba , where Hernández de <unk> wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage , the cities , the plantations , and , most importantly , the discovery of gold . Hernández died soon after from his wounds . The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated ; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán . 
 Based upon Hernández de Córdoba 's report and the testimony of the interrogated Indian prisoners , Governor Velázquez wrote to the Council of the Indies notifying it of " his " discovery . 
 = = Juan de Grijalva , 1518 = = 
 Diego Velázquez , the governor of Cuba , was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba 's report of gold in Yucatán . He organised a new expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men . He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command . Francisco de Montejo , who would eventually conquer much of the peninsula , was captain of one of the ships , ; Pedro de Alvarado and Alonso d 'Avila captained the other ships . Bernal Díaz del Castillo served on the crew ; he was able to secure a place on the expedition as a favour from the governor , who was his kinsman . Antón de Alaminos once again served as pilot . Governor Velázquez provided all four ships , in an attempt to protect his claim over the peninsula . The small fleet was stocked with crossbows , muskets , barter goods , salted pork and cassava bread . Grijalva also took one of the captured Indians from the Hernández expedition . 
 The fleet left Cuba in April 1518 , and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel , off the east coast of Yucatán . The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish and would not respond to Grijalva 's friendly overtures . The fleet sailed south from Cozumel , along the east coast of the peninsula . The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast , one of which was probably Tulum . On Ascension Thursday the fleet discovered a large bay , which the Spanish named Bahía de la Ascensión . Grijalva did not land at any of these cities and turned back north from Ascensión Bay . He looped around the north of the Yucatán Peninsula to sail down the west coast . At Campeche the Spanish tried to barter for water but the Maya refused , so Grijalva opened fire against the city with small cannon ; the inhabitants fled , allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city . Messages were sent with a few Maya who had been too slow to escape but the Maya remained hidden in the forest . The Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast . 
 At Champotón , where the inhabitants had routed Hernández and his men , the fleet was approached by a small number of large war canoes , but the ships ' cannon soon put them to flight . At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach . By means of interpreters , Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies . From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west . The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold @-@ rich empire , sailing as far north as Pánuco River . As the fleet returned to Cuba , the Spanish attacked Champotón to avenge the previous year 's defeat of the Spanish expedition led by Hernández . One Spaniard was killed and fifty were wounded in the ensuing battle , including Grijalva . Grijalva put into the port of Havana five months after he had left . 
 = = Hernán Cortés , 1519 = = 
 Grijalva 's return aroused great interest in Cuba , and Yucatán was believed to be a land of riches waiting to be plundered . A new expedition was organised , with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses . Hernán Cortés was placed in command , and his crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors , including Pedro de Alvarado , Cristóbal de Olid , Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz . Also aboard were the Francisco de Montejo and Bernal Díaz del Castillo , veterans of the Grijalva expedition . 
 The fleet made its first landfall at Cozumel , and Cortés remained there for several days . Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them . At Cozumel Cortés heard rumours of bearded men on the Yucatán mainland , who he presumed were Europeans . Cortés sent out messengers to them and was able to rescue the shipwrecked Gerónimo de Aguilar , who had been enslaved by a Maya lord . Aguilar had learnt the Yucatec Maya language and became Cortés ' interpreter . 
 From Cozumel , the fleet looped around the north of the Yucatán Peninsula and followed the coast to the Tabasco River , which Cortés renamed as the Grijalva River in honour of the Spanish captain who had discovered it . In Tabasco , Cortés anchored his ships at Potonchán , a Chontal Maya town . The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome . The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold , food , clothing and a group of young women in tribute to the victors . Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called <unk> , who was given the Spanish name Marina . She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means be which Cortés was able to communicate with the Aztecs . Marina became Cortés ' consort and eventually bore him a son . From Tabasco , Cortés continued to <unk> in Veracruz , a subject city of the Aztec Empire , and from there went on to conquer the Aztecs . 
 In 1519 Cortés sent the veteran Francisco de Montejo back to Spain with treasure for the king . While he was in Spain he pleaded Cortés ' cause against the supporters of Diego de Velasquez . Montejo remained in Spain for seven years , and eventually succeeded in acquiring the hereditary military title of adelantado . 
 = = Hernán Cortés in the Maya lowlands , 1524 – 25 = = 
 In 1524 , after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , Hernán Cortés led an expedition to Honduras over land , cutting across Acalan in southern Campeche and the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Petén Department of Guatemala . His aim was to subdue the rebellious Cristóbal de Olid , whom he had sent to conquer Honduras ; Olid had , however , set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory . Cortés left Tenochtitlan on 12 October 1524 with 140 Spanish soldiers , 93 of them mounted , 3 @,@ 000 Mexican warriors , 150 horses , a herd of pigs , artillery , munitions and other supplies . He also had with him the captured Aztec emperor <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> , the captive Aztec lords of Texcoco and <unk> . Cortés marched into Maya territory in Tabasco ; the army crossed the Usumacinta River near Tenosique and crossed into the Chontal Maya province of Acalan , where he recruited 600 Chontal Maya carriers . In Acalan , Cortés believed that the captive Aztec lords were plotting against him and he ordered <unk> and <unk> to be hanged . Cortés and his army left Acalan on 5 March 1525 . 
 The expedition passed onwards through Kejache territory and reported that the Kejache towns were situated in easily defensible locations and were often fortified . One of these was built on a rocky outcrop near a lake and a river that fed into it . The town was fortified with a wooden palisade and was surrounded by a moat . Cortés reported that the town of <unk> was even larger and was fortified with walls , watchtowers and earthworks ; the town itself was divided into three individually fortified districts . <unk> was said to have been at war with the unnamed smaller town . The Kejache claimed that their towns were fortified against the attacks of their aggressive Itza neighbours . 
 They arrived at the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá on 13 March 1525 . The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of Aj Kan Ek ' , the king of the Itza , who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols . Cortés accepted an invitation from Kan Ek ' to visit Nojpetén ( also known as Tayasal ) , and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore . On his departure from Nojpetén , Cortés left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity , attempting to feed it poultry , meat and flowers , but the animal soon died . The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618 , when Cortés ' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén . 
 From the lake , Cortés continued south along the western slopes of the Maya Mountains , a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) , during which he lost more than two @-@ thirds of his horses . When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition , Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids , which took two days to cross and cost him more horses . 
 On 15 April 1525 the expedition arrived at the Maya village of Tenciz . With local guides they headed into the hills north of Lake Izabal , where their guides abandoned them to their fate . The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety . Cortés found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal , perhaps Xocolo . He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito , somewhere on the Amatique Bay , with about a dozen companions , and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the next week . By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred ; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for , only to find that Cristóbal de Olid 's own officers had already put down his rebellion . Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea . 
 = = Francisco de Montejo , 1527 – 28 = = 
 The richer lands of Mexico engaged the main attention of the Conquistadors for some years , then in 1526 Francisco de Montejo ( a veteran of the Grijalva and Cortés expeditions ) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for the right to conquer Yucatán . On 8 December of that year he was issued with the hereditary military title of adelantado and permission to colonise the Yucatán Peninsula . In 1527 he left Spain with 400 men in four ships , with horses , small arms , cannon and provisions . He set sail for Santo Domingo , where more supplies and horses were collected , allowing Montejo to increase his cavalry to fifty . One of the ships was left at Santo Domingo as a supply ship to provide later support ; the other ships set sail and reached Cozumel , an island off the east coast of Yucatán , in the second half of September 1527 . Montejo was received in peace by the lord of Cozumel , Aj Naum Pat , but the ships only stopped briefly before making for the Yucatán coast . The expedition made landfall somewhere near Xelha in the Maya province of Ekab , in what is now Mexico 's Quintana Roo state . 
 Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 soldiers under his second @-@ in @-@ command , Alonso d 'Avila , and posted 20 more at nearby Pole . Xelha was renamed Salamanca de Xelha and became the first Spanish settlement in the peninsula . The provisions were soon exhausted and additional food was seized from the local Maya villagers ; this too was soon consumed . Many local Maya fled into the forest and Spanish raiding parties scoured the surrounding area for food , finding little . With discontent growing among his men , Montejo took the drastic step of burning his ships ; this strengthened the resolve of his troops , who gradually acclimatised to the harsh conditions of Yucatán . Montejo was able to get more food from the still @-@ friendly Aj <unk> Pat , when the latter made a visit to the mainland . Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north @-@ eastern portion of the Yucatán peninsula . His expedition passed through the towns of Xamanha , Mochis and Belma , none of which survives today . At Belma , Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and ordered them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown . After this , Montejo led his men to Conil , a town in Ekab that was described as having 5 @,@ 000 houses , where the Spanish party halted for two months . 
 In the spring of 1528 , Montejo left Conil for the city of Chauaca , which was abandoned by its Maya inhabitants under cover of darkness . The following morning the inhabitants attacked the Spanish party but were defeated . The Spanish then continued to Ake , some 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) north of <unk> , where they engaged in a major battle against the Maya , which killed more than 1 @,@ 200 Maya . After this Spanish victory , the neighbouring Maya leaders all surrendered . Montejo 's party then continued to <unk> and Loche before heading back to Xelha . Montejo arrived at Xelha with only 60 of his party , and found that only 12 of his 40 @-@ man garrison survived , while the garrison at Pole had been entirely wiped out . 
 The support ship eventually arrived from Santo Domingo , and Montejo used it to sail south along the coast , while he sent D 'Avila via land . Montejo discovered the thriving port city of Chaktumal ( modern Chetumal ) . At Chaktumal , Montejo learnt that shipwrecked Spanish sailor Gonzalo de Guerrero was in the region , and Montejo sent messages to him , inviting him to return to join his compatriots , but Guerrero declined . 
 The Maya at Chaktumal fed false information to the Spanish , and Montejo was unable to find d 'Avila and link up with him . D 'Avila returned overland to Xelha , and transferred the fledgling Spanish colony to nearby Xamanha , modern Playa del Carmen , which Montejo considered to be a better port . After waiting for d 'Avila without result , Montejo sailed south as far as the Ulúa River in Honduras before turning around and heading back up the coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha . Late in 1528 , Montejo left d 'Avila to oversee Xamanha and sailed north to loop around the Yucatán Peninsula and head for the Spanish colony of New Spain in central Mexico . 
 = = Francisco de Montejo and Alonso d 'Avila , 1531 – 35 = = 
 Montejo was appointed alcalde mayor ( a local colonial governor ) of Tabasco in 1529 , and pacified that province with the aid of his son , also named Francisco de Montejo . D 'Avila was sent from eastern Yucatán to conquer Acalan , which extended southeast of the Laguna de <unk> . Montejo the Younger founded Salamanca de Xicalango as a base of operations . In 1530 D 'Avila established Salamanca de Acalán as a base from which to launch new attempts to conquer Yucatán . Salamanca de Acalán proved a disappointment , with no gold for the taking and with lower levels of population than had been hoped . D 'Avila soon abandoned the new settlement and set off across the lands of the Kejache to Champotón , arriving there towards the end of 1530 . During a colonial power struggle in Tabasco , the elder Montejo was imprisoned for a time . Upon his release he met up with his son in Xicalango , Tabasco , and they then both rejoined d 'Avila at Champotón . 
 In 1531 Montejo moved his base of operations to Campeche . Alonso d 'Avila was sent overland to Chauaca in the east of the peninsula , passing through Maní where he was well received by the Xiu Maya . D 'Avila continued southeast to Chetumal where he founded the Spanish town of Villa Real ( " Royal Town " ) . The local Maya fiercely resisted the placement of the new Spanish colony and d 'Avila and his men were forced to abandon Villa Real and make for Honduras in canoes . 
 At Campeche , the Maya amassed a strong force and attacked the city ; the Spanish were able to fight them off , although the elder Montejo was almost killed . Aj Canul , the lord of the attacking Maya , surrendered to the Spanish . After this battle , the younger Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province , where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the Spanish town of Ciudad Real at Chichen Itza . Montejo carved up the province amongst his soldiers and gave each of his men two to three thousand Maya in encomienda . After six months of Spanish rule , Cupul dissatisfaction could no longer be contained and Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo the Younger . The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and , in mid 1533 , they laid siege to the small Spanish garrison at Chichen Itza . Montejo the Younger abandoned Ciudad Real by night after arranging a distraction for their attackers , and he and his men fled west , where the Chel , Pech and Xiu provinces remained obedient to Spanish rule . Montejo the Younger was received in friendship by Namux Chel , the lord of the Chel province , at Dzilam . In the spring of 1534 he rejoined his father in the Chakan province at Dzikabal , near T 'ho ( the modern city of Mérida ) . 
 While his son had been attempting to consolidate the Spanish control of Cupul , Francisco de Montejo the Elder had met the Xiu ruler at Maní . The Xiu Maya maintained their friendship with the Spanish throughout the conquest and Spanish authority was eventually established over Yucatán in large part due to Xiu support . The Montejos , after reuniting at Dzikabal , founded a new Spanish town at Dzilam , although the Spanish suffered hardships there . Montejo the Elder returned to Campeche , where he was received with friendship by the local Maya . He was accompanied by the friendly Chel lord Namux Chel , who travelled on horseback , and two of the lord 's cousins , who were taken in chains . Montejo the Younger remained behind in Dzilam to continue his attempts at conquest of the region but , finding the situation too difficult , he soon retreated to Campeche to rejoin his father and Alonso d 'Avila , who had returned to Campeche shortly before Montejo the Younger . Around this time the news began to arrive of Francisco Pizarro 's conquests in Peru and the rich plunder that his soldiers were taking there , undermining the morale of Montejo 's already disenchanted band of followers . Montejo 's soldiers began to abandon him to seek their fortune elsewhere ; in seven years of attempted conquest in the northern provinces of the Yucatán Peninsula , very little gold had been found . Towards the end of 1534 or the beginning of the next year , Montejo the Elder and his son retreated from Campeche to Veracruz , taking their remaining soldiers with them . 
 Montejo the Elder became embroiled in colonial infighting over the right to rule Honduras , a claim that put him in conflict with Pedro de Alvarado , captain general of Guatemala , who also claimed Honduras as part of his jurisdiction . Alvarado was ultimately to prove successful . In Montejo the Elder 's absence , first in central Mexico , and then in Honduras , Montejo the Younger acted as lieutenant governor and captain general in Tabasco . 
 = = = Conflict at Champoton = = = 
 The Franciscan friar Jacobo de Testera arrived in Champoton in 1535 to attempt the peaceful incorporation of Yucatán into the Spanish Empire . Testera had been assured by the Spanish authorities that no military activity would be undertaken in Yucatán while he was attempting its conversion to the Roman Catholic faith , and that no soldiers would be permitted to enter the peninsula . His initial efforts were proving successful when Captain Lorenzo de Godoy arrived in Champoton at the command of soldiers despatched there by Montejo the Younger . Godoy and Testera were soon in conflict and the friar was forced to abandon Champoton and return to central Mexico . 
 Godoy 's attempt to subdue the Maya around Champoton was unsuccessful and the local Kowoj Maya resisted his attempts to assert Spanish dominance of the region . This resistance was sufficiently tenacious that Montejo the Younger sent his cousin from Tabasco to Champoton to take command . His diplomatic overtures to the Champoton Kowoj were successful and they submitted to Spanish rule . Champoton was the last Spanish outpost in the Yucatán Peninsula ; it was increasingly isolated and the situation there became difficult . 
 = = Conquest and settlement in northern Yucatán , 1540 – 46 = = 
 In 1540 Montejo the Elder , who was now in his late 60s , turned his royal rights to colonise Yucatán over to his son , Francisco Montejo the Younger . In early 1541 Montejo the Younger joined his cousin in <unk> ; he did not remain there long , and quickly moved his forces to Campeche . Once there Montejo the Younger , commanding between three and four hundred Spanish soldiers , established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucatán Peninsula . Shortly after establishing the Spanish presence in Campeche , Montejo the Younger summoned the local Maya lords and commanded them to submit to the Spanish Crown . A number of lords submitted peacefully , including the ruler of the Xiu Maya . The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo the Younger sent his cousin against them ; Montejo himself remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements . 
 Montejo the Younger 's cousin met the Canul Maya at Chakan , not far from T 'ho . On 6 January 1542 he founded the second permanent town council , calling the new colonial town Mérida . On 23 January , Tutul Xiu , the lord of Mani , approached the Spanish encampment at Mérida in peace , bearing sorely needed food supplies . He expressed interest in the Spanish religion and witnessed a Roman Catholic mass celebrated for his benefit . Tutul Xiu was greatly impressed and converted to the new religion ; he was baptised as Melchor and stayed with the Spanish at Mérida for two months , receiving instruction in the Catholic faith . Tutul Xiu was the ruler of the most powerful province of northern Yucatán and his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity had repercussions throughout the peninsula , and encouraged the lords of the western provinces of the peninsula to accept Spanish rule . The eastern provinces continued to resist Spanish overtures . 
 Montejo the Younger then sent his cousin to Chauaca where most of the eastern lords greeted him in peace . The Cochua Maya resisted fiercely but were soon defeated by the Spanish . The Cupul Maya also rose up against the newly imposed Spanish domination , but their opposition was quickly put down . Montejo continued to the eastern Ekab province , reaching the east coast at Pole . Stormy weather prevented the Spanish from crossing to Cozumel , and nine Spaniards were drowned in the attempted crossing . A further Spaniard was killed by hostile Maya . Rumours of this setback grew in the telling and both the Cupul and Cochua provinces once again rose up against their would @-@ be European overlords . The Spanish hold on the eastern portion of the peninsula remained tenuous and a number of Maya polities remained independent , including Chetumal , Cochua , Cupul , Sotuta and the Tazes . 
 On 8 November 1546 and alliance of eastern provinces launched a coordinated uprising against the Spanish . The provinces of Cupul , Cochua , Sotuta , Tazes , Uaymil , Chetumal and Chikinchel united in a concerted effort to drive the invaders from the peninsula ; the uprising lasted four months . Eighteen Spaniards were surprised in the eastern towns , and were sacrificed . A contemporary account described the slaughter of over 400 allied Maya , as well as livestock . Mérida and Campeche were forewarned of the impending attack ; Montejo the Younger and his cousin were in Campeche . Montejo the Elder arrived in Mérida from Chiapas in December 1546 , with reinforcements gathered from Champoton and Campeche . The rebellious eastern Maya were finally defeated in a single battle , in which twenty Spaniards and several hundred allied Maya were killed . This battle marked the final conquest of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula . As a result of the uprising and the Spanish response , many of the Maya inhabitants of the eastern and southern territories fled to the still unconquered Petén Basin , in the extreme south . The Spanish only achieved dominance in the north and the polities of Petén remained independent and continued to receive many refugees from the north . 
 = = Petén Basin , 1618 – 97 = = 
 The Petén Basin covers an area that is now part of Guatemala ; in colonial times it originally fell under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Yucatán , before being transferred to the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala in 1703 . The Itza kingdom centred upon Lake Petén Itzá had been visited by Hernán Cortés on his march to Honduras in 1525 . 
 = = = Early 17th century = = = 
 Following Cortés ' visit , no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years . In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still @-@ pagan Itza in central Petén . Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya . After an arduous six @-@ month journey the travellers were well received at Nojpetén by the current Kan Ek ' . They stayed for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza , but the Aj Kan Ek ' refused to renounce his Maya religion , although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries . Attempts to convert the Itza failed , and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with Kan Ek ' . The friars returned in October 1619 , and again Kan Ek ' welcomed them in a friendly manner , but this time the Maya priesthood were hostile and the missionaries were expelled without food or water , but survived the journey back to Mérida . 
 In March 1622 , the governor of Yucatán , Diego de Cardenas , ordered Captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano to launch an assault upon the Itza ; he set out from Yucatán with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucatán . His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado . In May the expedition advanced to Sakalum , southwest of Bacalar , where there was a lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements . En route to Nojpetén , Delgado believed that the soldiers ' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel , and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpetén with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize . In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts . When Mirones learnt of Delgado 's departure , he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse . The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj , but he was determined to reach Nojpetén . From Tipuj , Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ek ' , asking permission to travel to Nojpetén ; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions . The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital , but as soon as the Spanish soldiers let their guard down , the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals . The soldiers were sacrificed to the Maya gods . After their sacrifice , the Itza took Delgado , cut his heart out and dismembered him ; they displayed his head on a stake with the others . The fortune of the leader of Delgado 's Maya companions was no better . With no word from Delgado 's escort , Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with a Maya scout to learn their fate . When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Petén Itzá , the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them . Bernardino Ek , the scout , escaped and returned to Mirones with the news . Soon afterwards , on 27 January 1624 , an Itza war party led by AjK 'in P 'ol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum , and killed them all . Spanish reinforcements arrived too late . A number of local Maya men and women were killed by Spanish attackers , who also burned the town . 
 Following these killings , Spanish garrisons were stationed in several towns in southern Yucatán , and rewards were offered for the whereabouts of AjK 'in P 'ol . The Maya governor of Oxkutzcab , Fernando Kamal , set out with 150 Maya archers to track the <unk> down ; they succeeded in capturing the Itza captain and his followers , together with silverware from the looted Sakalum church and items belonging to Mirones . The prisoners were taken back to the Spanish Captain Antonio Méndez de Canzo , interrogated under torture , tried , and condemned to be hanged , drawn and quartered . They were decapitated , and the heads were displayed in the plazas of towns throughout the colonial Partido de la Sierra in what is now Mexico 's Yucatán state . These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695 . In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands ; the Spanish Crown lacked the time , money or interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades . 
 = = = Late 17th century = = = 
 In 1692 Basque nobleman Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi proposed to the Spanish king the construction of a road from Mérida southwards to link with the Guatemalan colony , in the process " reducing " any independent native populations into colonial congregaciones ; this was part of a greater plan to subjugate the Lakandon and Manche Ch 'ol of southern Petén and the upper reaches of the Usumacinta River . The original plan was for the province of Yucatán to build the northern section and for Guatemala to build the southern portion , with both meeting somewhere in Ch 'ol territory ; the plan was later modified to pass further east , through the kingdom of the Itza . 
 The governor of Yucatán , Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi , began to build the road from Campeche south towards Petén . At the beginning of March 1695 , Captain Alonso García de Paredes led a group of 50 Spanish soldiers , accompanied by native guides , muleteers and labourers . The expedition advanced south into Kejache territory , which began at Chunpich , about 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) north of the modern border between Mexico and Guatemala . He rounded up some natives to be moved into colonial settlements , but met with armed Kejache resistance . García decided to retreat around the middle of April . 
 In March 1695 , Captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set out from Cahabón in Alta Verapaz , Guatemala , with 70 Spanish soldiers , accompanied by a large number of Maya archers from Verapaz , native muleteers , and four Dominican friars . The Spanish pressed ahead to Lake Petén Itzá and engaged in a series of fierce skirmishes with Itza hunting parties . At the lakeshore , within sight of Nojpetén , the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south , back to their main camp . Interrogation of an Itza prisoner revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish ; the expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón . 
 In mid @-@ May 1695 García again marched southwards from Campeche , with 115 Spanish soldiers and 150 Maya musketeers , plus Maya labourers and muleteers ; the final tally was more than 400 people , which was regarded as a considerable army in the impoverished Yucatán province . Ursúa also ordered two companies of Maya musketeers from Tek 'ax and Oxk 'utzkab ' to join the expedition at B <unk> 'en Kawich , some 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) southeast of the city of Campeche . At the end of May three friars were assigned to join the Spanish force , accompanied by a lay brother . A second group of Franciscans would continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas ; it was led by friar Andrés de Avendaño , who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother . García ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki , some 25 leagues ( approximately 65 miles or 105 km ) north of Lake Petén Itzá , which would serve as the main military base for the Camino Real ( " Royal Road " ) project . 
 The Sajkab 'chen company of native musketeers pushed ahead with the road builders from <unk> ' to the first Kejache town at Chunpich , which the Kejache had fled . The company 's officers sent for reinforcements from García at Tzuktok ' but before any could arrive some 25 Kejache returned to Chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food . The nervous Sajkab 'chen sentries feared that the residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets at them , with both groups then retreating . The musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching Kejache archers . Several musketeers were injured in the ensuing skirmish and , the Kejache retreated along a forest path without injury . The Sajkab 'chen company followed the path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food . They seized the food and retreated back along the path . 
 Around 3 August García moved his entire army forward to Chunpich , and by October Spanish soldiers had established themselves near the source of the San Pedro River . By November Tzuktok ' was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki . In December 1695 the main force was reinforced with 250 soldiers , of which 150 were Spanish and pardo and 100 were Maya , together with labourers and muleteers . 
 = = = = Avendaño 's expedition , June 1695 = = = = 
 In May 1695 Antonio de Silva had appointed two groups of Franciscans to head for Petén ; the first group was to join up with García 's military expedition . The second group was to head for Lake Petén Itza independently . This second group was headed by friar Andrés de Avendaño . Avendaño was accompanied by another friar , a lay brother , and six Christian Maya . This latter group left Mérida on 2 June 1695 . Avendaño continued south along the course of the new road , finding increasing evidence of Spanish military activity . The Franciscans overtook García at B 'uk 'te , about 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) before Tzuktok ' . On 3 August García advanced to Chunpich but tried to persuade Avendaño to stay behind to minister to the prisoners from B 'uk 'te . Avendaño instead split his group and left in secret with just four Christian Maya companions , seeking the Chunpich Kejache that had attacked one of García 's advance companies and had now retreated into the forest . He was unable to find the Kejache but did manage to get information regarding a path that led southwards to the Itza kingdom . Avendaño returned to Tzuktok ' and reconsidered his plans ; the Franciscans were short of supplies , and the forcefully congregated Maya that they were charged with converting were disappearing back into the forest daily . Antonio de Silva ordered Avendaño to return to Mérida , and he arrived there on 17 September 1695 . Meanwhile , the other group of Franciscans , led by Juan de San Buenaventura Chávez , continued following the roadbuilders into Kejache territory , through IxB 'am , B 'atkab ' and Chuntuki ( modern <unk> near Carmelita , Petén ) . 
 = = = = San Buenaventura among the Kejache , September – November 1695 = = = = 
 Juan de San Buenaventura 's small group of Franciscans arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695 , and found that the army had opened the road southwards for another seventeen leagues ( approximately 44 @.@ 2 miles or 71 @.@ 1 km ) , almost half way to Lake Petén Itzá , but returned to Chuntuki due to the seasonal rains . San Buenaventura was accompanied by two friars and a lay brother . With Avendaño 's return to Mérida , provincial superior Antonio de Silva despatched two additional friars to join San Buenaventura 's group . One of these was to convert the Kejache in Tzuktok ' , and the other was to do the same at Chuntuki . On 24 October San Buenaventura wrote to the provincial superior reporting that the warlike Kejache were now pacified and that they had told him that the Itza were ready to receive the Spanish in friendship . On that day 62 Kejache men had voluntarily come to Chuntuki from Pak 'ek 'em , where another 300 Kejache resided . In early November 1695 , friar Tomás de Alcoser and brother Lucas de San Francisco were sent to establish a mission at Pak 'ek 'em , where they were well received by the cacique ( native chief ) and his pagan priest . Pak 'ek 'em was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference , and the friars oversaw the building of a church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory . A second church was built at B 'atkab ' to attend to over 100 K 'ejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of a Spanish friar ; a further church was established at Tzuktok ' , overseen by another friar . 
 = = = = Avendaño 's expedition , December 1695 – January 1696 = = = = 
 Franciscan Andrés de Avendaño left Mérida on 13 December 1695 , and arrived in Nojpetén around 14 January 1696 , accompanied by four companions . From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past the source of the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins . From there they followed the small <unk> River to a Chak 'an Itza town called <unk> . They arrived at the western end of Lake Petén Itzá to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza . The following day , the current Aj Kan Ek ' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chak 'an Itza port town of Nich , on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza . The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ek ' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days . Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ek ' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish Crown , without success . The king of the Itza , cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right . 
 On 19 January AjKowoj , the king of the Kowoj , arrived at Nojpetén and spoke with Avendaño , arguing against the acceptance of Christianity and Spanish rule . The discussions between Avendaño , Kan Ek ' and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza . Kan Ek ' learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans , and the Itza king advised them to return to Mérida via Tipuj . The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships , including the death of one of Avendaño 's companions , but after a month wandering in the forest found their way back to Chuntuki , and from there returned to Mérida . 
 = = = = Battle at Ch 'ich ' , 2 February 1696 = = = = 
 By mid @-@ January Captain García de Paredes had arrived at the advance portion of the Camino Real at Chuntuki . By now he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters . Captain Pedro de Zubiaur , García ’ s senior officer , arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers , two Franciscans , and allied Yucatec Maya warriors . They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters . They were approached by about 300 canoes carrying approximately 2 @,@ 000 Itza warriors . The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and a scuffle then broke out ; a dozen of the Spanish party were forced into canoes , and three of them were killed . At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets , and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners , who included the two Franciscans . The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by thousands of Itza warriors . Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas . Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered , the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki , abandoning their captured companions to their fate . 
 Martín de Ursúa was now convinced that Kan Ek ' would not surrender peacefully , and he began to organise an all @-@ out assault on Nojpetén . Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch 'ich ' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore , now supported by artillery . Again a large number of canoes gathered , and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets ; no casualties were reported among the Itza , who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance . 
 = = = = Expedition from Verapaz , February – March 1696 = = = = 
 <unk> Bartolomé de Amésqueta led the next Guatemalan expedition against the Itza . He marched his men from Cahabón to Mopán , arriving on 25 February 1696 . On 7 March , Captain Díaz de Velasco led a party ahead to the lake ; he was accompanied by two Dominican friars and by AjK 'ixaw , an Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz 's previous expedition . When they drew close to the shore of Lake Petén Itzá , AjK 'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén . Díaz 's party was lured into an Itza trap and the expedition members were killed to a man . The two friars were captured and sacrificed . The Itza killed a total of 87 expedition members , including 50 soldiers , two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers . 
 Amésqueta left Mopán three days after Díaz and followed Díaz ’ s trail to the lakeshore . He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men . As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance . Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén ; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby . In the early hours of the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight . At San Pedro <unk> he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695 , and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority . Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men , and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir , Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala . 
 = = = = Assault on Nojpetén = = = = 
 The Itzas ' continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities , and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all . Martín de Urzúa y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of Lake Petén Itzá with his soldiers on 26 February 1697 , and once there built the heavily armed galeota attack boat . The galeota carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces . The piragua longboat used to cross the San Pedro River was also transported to the lake to be used in the attack on the Itza capital . 
 On 10 March a number of Itza and Yalain emissaries arrived at Ch 'ich ' to negotiate with Ursúa . Kan Ek ' then sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries , who offered peaceful surrender . Ursúa received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ek ' to visit his encampment three days later . On the appointed day Kan Ek ' failed to arrive ; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake . 
 A waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek 's capital on the morning of 13 March . Ursúa boarded the galeota with 108 soldiers , two secular priests , five personal servants , the baptised Itza emissary AjChan and his brother @-@ in @-@ law and an Itza prisoner from Nojpetén . The attack boat was rowed east towards the Itza capital ; half way across the lake it encountered a large fleet of canoes spread in an arc across the approach to Nojpetén – Ursúa simply gave the order to row through them . A large quantity of defenders had gathered along the shore of Nojpetén and on the roofs of the city . Itza archers began to shoot at the invaders from the canoes . Ursúa ordered his men not to return fire but arrows wounded a number of his soldiers ; one of the wounded soldiers discharged his musket and at that point the officers lost control of their men . The defending Itza soon fled from the withering Spanish gunfire . 
 The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died ; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties . The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on the island ; the surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water . After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests , leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town . Martín de Ursúa planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpetén as Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo , Laguna del Itza ( " Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul , Lake of the Itza " ) . The Itza nobility fled , dispersing to Maya settlements throughout Petén ; in response the Spanish scoured the region with search parties . Kan Ek ' was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu ; The Kowoj king ( Aj Kowoj ) was also soon captured , together with other Maya nobles and their families . With the defeat of the Itza , the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers . 
 = Gilberto Gil = 
 Gilberto Passos Gil Moreira ( born 26 June 1942 ) , better known as Gilberto Gil ( Brazilian Portuguese : [ <unk> <unk> ] or [ <unk> ̯ <unk> <unk> ̯ ] ) , is a Brazilian singer , guitarist , and songwriter , known for both his musical innovation and political commitment . From 2003 to 2008 , he served as Brazil 's Minister of Culture in the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva . Gil 's musical style incorporates an eclectic range of influences , including Rock music , Brazilian genres including samba , African music , and reggae . 
 Gil started to play music as a child and was still a teenager when he joined his first band . He began his career as a bossa nova musician , and then grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism . He was a key figure in the Música popular <unk> and tropicália movements of the 1960s , alongside artists such as longtime collaborator Caetano Veloso . The Brazilian military regime that took power in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat , and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country . Gil moved to London , but returned to Bahia in 1972 and continued his musical career , as well as working as a politician and environmental advocate .

 = = = Early years ( 1942 – 1963 ) = = = 
 Gil was born in Salvador , an industrial city in the northeast of Brazil , though he spent much of his childhood in nearby Ituaçu . Ituaçu was a small town of fewer than a thousand , located in the sertão , or countryside , of Bahia . His father , José Gil Moreira , was a doctor ; his mother , <unk> Passos Gil Moreira , an elementary school teacher . As a young boy , he attended a Marist Brothers school . Gil remained in Ituaçu until he was nine years old , returning to Salvador for secondary school . 
 Gil 's interest in music was precocious : " When I was only two or two and a half , " he recalled , " I told my mother I was going to become a musician or a president of my country . " He grew up listening to the <unk> music of his native northeast , and took an interest in the street performers of Salvador . Early on , he began to play the drums and the trumpet , through listening to Bob Nelson on the radio . Gil 's mother was the " chief supporter " in his musical ambitions ; she bought him an accordion and , when he was ten years old , sent him to music school in Salvador which he attended for four years . As an accordionist , Gil first played classical music , but grew more interested in the folk and popular music of Brazil . He was particularly influenced by singer and accordion player Luiz Gonzaga ; he began to sing and play the accordion in an emulation of Gonzaga 's recordings . Gil has noted that he grew to identify with Gonzaga " because he sang about the world around [ him ] , the world that [ he ] encountered . " 
 During his years in Salvador , Gil also encountered the music of songwriter Dorival Caymmi , who he says represented to him the " beach @-@ oriented " samba music of Salvador . Gonzaga and Caymmi were Gil 's formative influences . While in Salvador , Gil was introduced to many other styles of music , including American big band jazz and tango . In 1950 Gil moved back to Salvador with his family . It was there , while still in high school , that he joined his first band , Os <unk> ( The Out of Tunes ) , in which he played accordion and vibraphone and sang . Os <unk> was influenced by American rock and roll musicians like Elvis Presley , as well as singing groups from Rio de Janeiro . The band was active for two to three years . Soon afterwards , inspired by Brazilian star João Gilberto , he settled on the guitar as his primary instrument and began to play bossa nova . 
 = = = Musical career ( 1963 – present ) = = = 
 Gil met guitarist and singer Caetano Veloso at the Universidade Federal da Bahia ( Federal University of Bahia ) in 1963 . The two immediately began collaborating and performing together , releasing a single and EP soon afterwards . Along with Maria <unk> ( Veloso 's sister ) , Gal Costa , and Tom Zé , Gil and Veloso performed bossa nova and traditional Brazilian songs at the Vila Velha Theatre 's opening night in July 1964 , a show entitled <unk> , por <unk> ( Us , for Example ) . Gil and the group continued to perform at the venue and he eventually became a musical director of the concert series . Gil collaborated again with members of this collective on the landmark 1968 album Tropicália : ou Panis et Circenses , whose style was influenced by The Beatles ' Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , an album Gil listened to constantly . Gil describes Tropicália : ou Panis et Circenses as the birth of the tropicália movement . As Gil describes it , tropicália ( or Tropicalismo ) was a conflation of musical and cultural developments that had occurred in Brazil during the 1950s and 1960s — primarily bossa nova and the <unk> Guarda ( Young Wave ) collective — with rock and roll music from the United States and Europe , a movement deemed threatening by the Brazilian government of the time . 
 Early on in the 1960s , Gil earned income primarily from selling bananas in a shopping mall and composing jingles for television advertisements ; he was also briefly employed by the Brazilian division of Unilever , <unk> @-@ Lever . He moved to São Paulo in 1965 and had a hit single when his song " <unk> " ( which later appeared on the album of the same name ) was released by Elis Regina . However , his first hit as a solo artist was the 1969 song " Aquele Abraço " . Gil also performed in several television programs throughout the 1960s , which often included other " <unk> " , members of the Tropicalismo movement . One of these programs , Divino <unk> , which featured Veloso , gained attention from government television censors after it aired a satirical version of the national anthem in December 1968 . 
 In February 1969 Gil and Veloso were arrested by the Brazilian military government , brought from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro , and spent three months in prison and another four under house arrest , before being freed on the condition that they leave the country . Veloso was the first to be arrested ; the police moved to Gil 's home soon afterward . Veloso had directed his then @-@ wife <unk> <unk> to warn Gil about the possibility of arrest , but Gil was eventually brought into the police van along with Veloso . They were given no reason or charge for their arrest . Gil believes that the government felt his actions " represent [ ed ] a threat [ to them ] , something new , something that can 't quite be understood , something that doesn 't fit into any of the clear compartments of existing cultural practices , and that won 't do . That is dangerous . " During his prison sentence , Gil began to meditate , follow a <unk> diet , and read about Eastern philosophy . He composed four songs during his imprisonment , among them " <unk> <unk> " ( Electronic Brain ) , which first appeared on his 1969 album Gilberto Gil 1969 , and later on his 2006 album Gil Luminoso . Thereafter , Gil and Veloso were exiled to London , England after being offered to leave Brazil . The two played a last Brazilian concert together in Salvador in July 1969 , then left to Portugal , Paris , and finally London . He and Veloso took a house in Chelsea , sharing it with their manager and wives . Gil was involved in the organisation of the 1971 Glastonbury Free Festival and was exposed to reggae while living in London ; he recalls listening to Bob Marley ( whose songs he later covered ) , Jimmy Cliff , and Burning Spear . He was heavily influenced by and involved with the city 's rock scene as well , performing with Yes , Pink Floyd , and the Incredible String Band . However , he also performed solo , recording Gilberto Gil ( <unk> ) while in London . In addition to involvement in the reggae and rock scenes , Gil attended performances by jazz artists , including Miles Davis and Sun Ra . 
 When he went back to Bahia in 1972 , Gil focused on his musical career and environmental advocacy work . He released Expresso <unk> the same year , from which two popular singles were released . Gil toured the United States and recorded an English @-@ language album as well , continuing to release a steady stream of albums throughout the 1970s , including <unk> and <unk> . In the early 1970s Gil participated in a resurgence of the Afro @-@ Brazilian afoxé tradition in Carnaval , joining the Filhos de Gandhi ( Sons of Gandhi ) performance group , which only allowed black Brazilians to join . Gil also recorded a song titled " <unk> de Gandhi " written about the Filhos de Gandhi that appeared on his 1977 album <unk> . Greater attention was paid to afoxé groups in Carnaval because of the publicity that Gil had provided to them through his involvement ; the groups increased in size as well . In the late 1970s he left Brazil for Africa and visited Senegal , Ivory Coast , and Nigeria . He also worked with Jimmy Cliff and released a cover of " No Woman , No Cry " with him in 1980 , a number one hit that introduced reggae to Brazil . 
 In 1996 , Gil contributed " <unk> " to the AIDS @-@ Benefit Album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization . 
 In 1998 the live version of his album Quanta won Gil the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album . In 2005 he won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album for <unk> . In May 2005 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize by Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm , the prize 's first Latin American recipient . On October 16 of the same year he received the Légion d 'honneur from the French government , coinciding with the <unk> du <unk> en France ( Brazil 's Year in France ) . 
 In 2010 he released the album Fé Na Festa , a record devoted to <unk> , a style of music from Brazil 's northeast . His tour to promote this album received some negative feedback from fans who were expecting to hear a set featuring his hits . In 2013 , Gilberto Gil plays his own role as a singer and promoter of cultural diversity in a long feature documentary shot around the southern hemisphere by Swiss filmmaker Pierre @-@ Yves <unk> , <unk> : a musical journey with Gilberto Gil , distributed worldwide . The film also inaugurates the <unk> experiment for pan @-@ European and multi @-@ support releases . 
 = = = Political career ( 1987 – present ) = = = 
 Gil describes his attitude towards politics thus : " I 'd rather see my position in the government as that of an administrator or manager . But politics is a necessary ingredient . " His political career began in 1987 , when he was elected to a local post in Bahia and became the Salvador secretary of culture . In 1988 , he was elected to the city council and subsequently became city commissioner for environmental protection . However , he left the office after one term and declined to run for the National Congress of Brazil . In 1990 , Gil left the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and joined the Green Party . During this period , Gil founded the environmental protection organization Onda Azul ( Blue Wave ) , which worked to protect Brazilian waters . He maintained a full @-@ time musical career at the same time , and withdrew temporarily from politics in 1992 , following the release <unk> , considered to be one of his most successful efforts . On October 16 , 2001 Gil accepted his nomination to be a Goodwill Ambassador for the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) of the United Nations , having promoted the organization before his appointment . 
 When President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in January 2003 , he chose Gil as Brazil 's new Minister of Culture , only the second black person to serve in the country 's cabinet . The appointment was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press ; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism . Gil is not a member of Lula 's Workers ' Party and did not participate in creating its cultural program . Shortly after becoming Minister , Gil began a partnership between Brazil and Creative Commons . As Minister , he has sponsored a program called Culture Points , which gives grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country 's cities . Gil has since asserted that " You 've now got young people who are becoming designers , who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods . It 's a different vision of the role of government , a new role . " Gil has also expressed interest in a program that will establish an Internet repository of freely downloadable Brazilian music . Since Gil 's appointment , the department 's expenditures have increased by over 50 percent . In November 2007 Gil announced his intention to resign from his post due to a vocal cord polyp . Lula rejected Gil 's first two attempts to resign , but accepted another request in July 2008 . Lula said on this occasion that Gil was " going back to being a great artist , going back to giving priority to what is most important " to him . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 Gil has been married four times . His fourth wife is Flora Nair Giordano Gil Moreira . The couple has five children , four of whom are still living . The fifth child – Pedro Gil , <unk> 's drummer – died in a car accident in 1990 . Preta Gil , an actress and singer , is his daughter . 
 Gil 's religious beliefs have changed significantly over his lifetime . Originally , he was a Christian , but was later influenced by Eastern philosophy and religion , and , later still , explored African spirituality . He is now an agnostic . He practices yoga and is a vegetarian . 
 Gil has been open about the fact that he has smoked marijuana for much of his life . He has said he believes " that drugs should be treated like pharmaceuticals , legalized , although under the same regulations and monitoring as medicines " . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Gil is a tenor , but he sings in the baritone or falsetto register , with lyrics and / or scat syllables . His lyrics are on subjects that range from philosophy to religion , folktales , and word play . Gil 's musical style incorporates a broad range of influences . The first music he was exposed to included The Beatles and street performers in various metropolitan areas of Bahia . During his first years as a musician , Gil performed primarily in a blend of traditional Brazilian styles with two @-@ step rhythms , such as baião and samba . He states that " My first phase was one of traditional forms . Nothing experimental at all . Caetano [ Veloso ] and I followed in the tradition of Luiz Gonzaga and Jackson do <unk> , combining samba with northeastern music . " 
 As one of the pioneers of tropicália , influences from genres such as rock and punk have been pervasive in his recordings , as they have been in those of other stars of the period , including Caetano Veloso and Tom Zé . Gil 's interest in the blues @-@ based music of rock pioneer Jimi Hendrix , in particular , has been described by Veloso as having " extremely important consequences for Brazilian music " . Veloso also noted the influence of Brazilian guitarist and singer Jorge Ben on Gil 's musical style , coupled with that of traditional music . After the height of tropicália in the 1960s , Gil became increasingly interested in black culture , particularly in the Jamaican musical genre of reggae . He described the genre as " a form of democratizing , <unk> , speaking a new language , a Heideggerian form of passing along fundamental messages " . 
 Visiting Lagos , Nigeria , in 1976 for the Festival of African Culture ( <unk> ) , Gil met fellow musicians Fela Kuti and Stevie Wonder . He became inspired by African music and later integrated some of the styles he had heard in Africa , such as juju and highlife , into his own recordings . One of the most famous of these African @-@ influenced records was the 1977 album <unk> , which included " No Norte da Saudade " ( To the North of Sadness ) , a song heavily influenced by reggae . When Gil returned to Brazil after the visit , he focused on Afro @-@ Brazilian culture , becoming a member of the Carnaval afoxé group Filhos de Gandhi . 
 Conversely , his 1980s musical repertoire presented an increased development of dance trends , such as disco and soul , as well as the previous incorporation of rock and punk . However , Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was not such a new direction , as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso . He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance , as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots . Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena . He has had to walk a fine line , simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets . Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles , while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it .

 = Shapley – Folkman lemma = 
 The Shapley – Folkman lemma is a result in convex geometry with applications in mathematical economics that describes the Minkowski addition of sets in a vector space . Minkowski addition is defined as the addition of the sets ' members : for example , adding the set consisting of the integers zero and one to itself yields the set consisting of zero , one , and two : 
 { 0 , 1 } + { 0 , 1 } 
 = { 0 + 0 , 0 + 1 , 1 + 0 , 1 + 1 } = 
 { 0 , 1 , 2 } . 
 The Shapley – Folkman lemma and related results provide an affirmative answer to the question , " Is the sum of many sets close to being convex ? " A set is defined to be convex if every line segment joining two of its points is a subset in the set : For example , the solid disk <formula> is a convex set but the circle <formula> is not , because the line segment joining two distinct points <formula> is not a subset of the circle . The Shapley – Folkman lemma suggests that if the number of summed sets exceeds the dimension of the vector space , then their Minkowski sum is approximately convex . 
 The Shapley – Folkman lemma was introduced as a step in the proof of the Shapley – Folkman theorem , which states an upper bound on the distance between the Minkowski sum and its convex hull . The convex hull of a set Q is the smallest convex set that contains Q. This distance is zero if and only if the sum is convex . The theorem 's bound on the distance depends on the dimension D and on the shapes of the summand @-@ sets , but not on the number of summand @-@ sets N , when N > D. The shapes of a subcollection of only D summand @-@ sets determine the bound on the distance between the Minkowski average of N sets 
 1 ⁄ N ( Q1 + Q2 + ... + <unk> ) 
 and its convex hull . As N increases to infinity , the bound decreases to zero ( for summand @-@ sets of uniformly bounded size ) . The Shapley – Folkman theorem 's upper bound was decreased by Starr 's corollary ( alternatively , the Shapley – Folkman – Starr theorem ) . 
 The lemma of Lloyd Shapley and Jon Folkman was first published by the economist Ross M. Starr , who was investigating the existence of economic equilibria while studying with Kenneth Arrow . In his paper , Starr studied a convexified economy , in which non @-@ convex sets were replaced by their convex hulls ; Starr proved that the convexified economy has equilibria that are closely approximated by " quasi @-@ equilibria " of the original economy ; moreover , he proved that every quasi @-@ equilibrium has many of the optimal properties of true equilibria , which are proved to exist for convex economies . Following Starr 's 1969 paper , the Shapley – Folkman – Starr results have been widely used to show that central results of ( convex ) economic theory are good approximations to large economies with non @-@ convexities ; for example , quasi @-@ equilibria closely approximate equilibria of a convexified economy . " The derivation of these results in general form has been one of the major achievements of postwar economic theory " , wrote Roger Guesnerie . The topic of non @-@ convex sets in economics has been studied by many Nobel laureates , besides Lloyd Shapley who won the prize in 2012 : Arrow ( 1972 ) , Robert Aumann ( 2005 ) , Gérard Debreu ( 1983 ) , Tjalling Koopmans ( 1975 ) , Paul Krugman ( 2008 ) , and Paul Samuelson ( 1970 ) ; the complementary topic of convex sets in economics has been emphasized by these laureates , along with Leonid Hurwicz , Leonid Kantorovich ( 1975 ) , and Robert Solow ( 1987 ) . 
 The Shapley – Folkman lemma has applications also in optimization and probability theory . In optimization theory , the Shapley – Folkman lemma has been used to explain the successful solution of minimization problems that are sums of many functions . The Shapley – Folkman lemma has also been used in proofs of the " law of averages " for random sets , a theorem that had been proved for only convex sets . 
 = = Introductory example = = 
 For example , the subset of the integers { 0 , 1 , 2 } is contained in the interval of real numbers [ 0 , 2 ] , which is convex . The Shapley – Folkman lemma implies that every point in [ 0 , 2 ] is the sum of an integer from { 0 , 1 } and a real number from [ 0 , 1 ] . 
 The distance between the convex interval [ 0 , 2 ] and the non @-@ convex set { 0 , 1 , 2 } equals one @-@ half 
 1 / 2 
 = | 1 − 1 / 2 | = 
 | 0 − 1 / 2 | 
 = | 2 − 3 / 2 | = 
 | 1 − 3 / 2 | . 
 However , the distance between the average Minkowski sum 
 1 / 2 ( { 0 , 1 } + { 0 , 1 } ) = { 0 , 1 / 2 , 1 } 
 and its convex hull [ 0 , 1 ] is only 1 / 4 , which is half the distance ( 1 / 2 ) between its summand { 0 , 1 } and [ 0 , 1 ] . As more sets are added together , the average of their sum " fills out " its convex hull : The maximum distance between the average and its convex hull approaches zero as the average includes more summands . 
 = = Preliminaries = = 
 The Shapley – Folkman lemma depends upon the following definitions and results from convex geometry . 
 = = = Real vector spaces = = = 
 A real vector space of two dimensions can be given a Cartesian coordinate system in which every point is identified by an ordered pair of real numbers , called " coordinates " , which are conventionally denoted by x and y . Two points in the Cartesian plane can be added coordinate @-@ wise 
 ( x1 , y1 ) + ( x2 , y2 ) 
 = ( x1 + x2 , y1 + y2 ) ; 
 further , a point can be multiplied by each real number λ coordinate @-@ wise 
 λ ( x , y ) = 
 ( <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 More generally , any real vector space of ( finite ) dimension D can be viewed as the set of all D @-@ tuples of D real numbers { ( v1 , v2 , . . . , vD ) } on which two operations are defined : vector addition and multiplication by a real number . For finite @-@ dimensional vector spaces , the operations of vector addition and real @-@ number multiplication can each be defined coordinate @-@ wise , following the example of the Cartesian plane . 
 = = = Convex sets = = = 
 In a real vector space , a non @-@ empty set Q is defined to be convex if , for each pair of its points , every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset of Q. For example , a solid disk <formula> is convex but a circle <formula> is not , because it does not contain a line segment joining its points <formula> ; the non @-@ convex set of three integers { 0 , 1 , 2 } is contained in the interval [ 0 , 2 ] , which is convex . For example , a solid cube is convex ; however , anything that is hollow or dented , for example , a crescent shape , is non @-@ convex . The empty set is convex , either by definition or <unk> , depending on the author . 
 More formally , a set Q is convex if , for all points v0 and v1 in Q and for every real number λ in the unit interval [ 0 @,@ 1 ] , the point 
 ( 1 − λ ) v0 + <unk> 
 is a member of Q. 
 By mathematical induction , a set Q is convex if and only if every convex combination of members of Q also belongs to Q. By definition , a convex combination of an indexed subset { v0 , v1 , . . . , vD } of a vector space is any weighted average <unk> + <unk> + . . . + <unk> , for some indexed set of non @-@ negative real numbers { <unk> } satisfying the equation <unk> + λ1 + . . . + <unk> = 1 . 
 The definition of a convex set implies that the intersection of two convex sets is a convex set . More generally , the intersection of a family of convex sets is a convex set . In particular , the intersection of two disjoint sets is the empty set , which is convex . 
 = = = Convex hull = = = 
 For every subset Q of a real vector space , its convex hull Conv ( Q ) is the minimal convex set that contains Q. Thus Conv ( Q ) is the intersection of all the convex sets that cover Q. The convex hull of a set can be equivalently defined to be the set of all convex combinations of points in Q. For example , the convex hull of the set of integers { 0 @,@ 1 } is the closed interval of real numbers [ 0 @,@ 1 ] , which contains the integer end @-@ points . The convex hull of the unit circle is the closed unit disk , which contains the unit circle . 
 = = = Minkowski addition = = = 
 In a real vector space , the Minkowski sum of two ( non @-@ empty ) sets Q1 and Q2 is defined to be the set Q1 + Q2 formed by the addition of vectors element @-@ wise from the summand sets 
 Q1 + Q2 
 = { q1 + q2 : q1 ∈ Q1 and q2 ∈ Q2 } . 
 For example 
 { 0 , 1 } + { 0 , 1 } = 
 { 0 + 0 , 0 + 1 , 1 + 0 , 1 + 1 } 
 = { 0 , 1 , 2 } . 
 By the principle of mathematical induction , the Minkowski sum of a finite family of ( non @-@ empty ) sets 
 { Qn : Qn ≠ Ø and 1 ≤ n ≤ N } 
 is the set formed by element @-@ wise addition of vectors 
 ∑ Qn = 
 { ∑ qn : qn ∈ Qn } . 
 = = = Convex hulls of Minkowski sums = = = 
 Minkowski addition behaves well with respect to " convexification " — the operation of taking convex hulls . Specifically , for all subsets Q1 and Q2 of a real vector space , the convex hull of their Minkowski sum is the Minkowski sum of their convex hulls . That is , 
 Conv ( Q1 + Q2 ) 
 = Conv ( Q1 ) + Conv ( Q2 ) . 
 This result holds more generally , as a consequence of the principle of mathematical induction . For each finite collection of sets , 
 Conv ( ∑ Qn ) = 
 ∑ Conv ( Qn ) . 
 = = Statements = = 
 The preceding identity Conv ( ∑ Qn ) 
 = ∑ Conv ( Qn ) implies that if a point x lies in the convex hull of the Minkowski sum of N sets 
 x ∈ Conv ( ∑ Qn ) 
 then x lies in the sum of the convex hulls of the summand @-@ sets 
 x ∈ ∑ Conv ( Qn ) . 
 By the definition of Minkowski addition , this last expression means that x = 
 ∑ qn for some selection of points qn in the convex hulls of the summand @-@ sets , that is , where each qn ∈ Conv ( Qn ) . In this representation , the selection of the summand @-@ points qn depends on the chosen sum @-@ point x . 
 = = = <unk> of Shapley and Folkman = = = 
 For this representation of the point x , the Shapley – Folkman lemma states that if the dimension D is less than the number of summands 
 D < N 
 then convexification is needed for only D summand @-@ sets , whose choice depends on x : The point has a representation 
 <formula> 
 where <unk> belongs to the convex hull of Qd for D ( or fewer ) summand @-@ sets and qn belongs to Qn itself for the remaining sets . That is , 
 <formula> 
 for some re @-@ indexing of the summand sets ; this re @-@ indexing depends on the particular point x being represented . 
 The Shapley – Folkman lemma implies , for example , that every point in [ 0 , 2 ] is the sum of an integer from { 0 , 1 } and a real number from [ 0 , 1 ] . 
 = = = = Dimension of a real vector space = = = = 
 Conversely , the Shapley – Folkman lemma characterizes the dimension of finite @-@ dimensional , real vector spaces . That is , if a vector space obeys the Shapley – Folkman lemma for a natural number D , and for no number less than D , then its dimension is exactly D ; the Shapley – Folkman lemma holds for only finite @-@ dimensional vector spaces . 
 = = = Shapley – Folkman theorem and Starr 's corollary = = = 
 Shapley and Folkman used their lemma to prove their theorem , which bounds the distance between a Minkowski sum and its convex hull , the " convexified " sum : 
 The Shapley – Folkman theorem states that the squared Euclidean distance from any point in the convexified sum Conv ( ∑ Qn ) to the original ( unconvexified ) sum ∑ Qn is bounded by the sum of the squares of the D largest <unk> of the sets Qn ( the radii of the smallest spheres enclosing these sets ) . This bound is independent of the number of summand @-@ sets N ( if N > D ) . 
 The Shapley – Folkman theorem states a bound on the distance between the Minkowski sum and its convex hull ; this distance is zero if and only if the sum is convex . Their bound on the distance depends on the dimension D and on the shapes of the summand @-@ sets , but not on the number of summand @-@ sets N , when N > D. 
 The <unk> often exceeds ( and cannot be less than ) the inner radius : 
 The inner radius of a set Qn is defined to be the smallest number r such that , for any point q in the convex hull of Qn , there is a sphere of radius r that contains a subset of Qn whose convex hull contains q . 
 Starr used the inner radius to reduce the upper bound stated in the Shapley – Folkman theorem : 
 Starr 's corollary to the Shapley – Folkman theorem states that the squared Euclidean distance from any point x in the convexified sum Conv ( ∑ Qn ) to the original ( unconvexified ) sum ∑ Qn is bounded by the sum of the squares of the D largest inner @-@ radii of the sets Qn . 
 Starr 's corollary states an upper bound on the Euclidean distance between the Minkowski sum of N sets and the convex hull of the Minkowski sum ; this distance between the sum and its convex hull is a measurement of the non @-@ convexity of the set . For simplicity , this distance is called the " non @-@ convexity " of the set ( with respect to Starr 's measurement ) . Thus , Starr 's bound on the non @-@ convexity of the sum depends on only the D largest inner radii of the summand @-@ sets ; however , Starr 's bound does not depend on the number of summand @-@ sets N , when N > D. For example , the distance between the convex interval [ 0 , 2 ] and the non @-@ convex set { 0 , 1 , 2 } equals one @-@ half 
 1 / 2 
 = | 1 − 1 / 2 | = 
 | 0 − 1 / 2 | 
 = | 2 − 3 / 2 | = 
 | 1 − 3 / 2 | . 
 Thus , Starr 's bound on the non @-@ convexity of the average

 decreases as the number of summands N increases . For example , the distance between the averaged set 
 1 / 2 ( { 0 , 1 } + { 0 , 1 } ) = { 0 , 1 / 2 , 1 } 
 and its convex hull [ 0 , 1 ] is only 1 / 4 , which is half the distance ( 1 / 2 ) between its summand { 0 , 1 } and [ 0 , 1 ] . The shapes of a subcollection of only D summand @-@ sets determine the bound on the distance between the average set and its convex hull ; thus , as the number of summands increases to infinity , the bound decreases to zero ( for summand @-@ sets of uniformly bounded size ) . In fact , Starr 's bound on the non @-@ convexity of this average set decreases to zero as the number of summands N increases to infinity ( when the inner radii of all the summands are bounded by the same number ) . 
 = = = Proofs and computations = = = 
 The original proof of the Shapley – Folkman lemma established only the existence of the representation , but did not provide an algorithm for computing the representation : Similar proofs have been given by Arrow and Hahn , Cassels , and Schneider , among others . An abstract and elegant proof by Ekeland has been extended by <unk> . Different proofs have appeared in unpublished papers , also . In 1981 , Starr published an iterative method for computing a representation of a given sum @-@ point ; however , his computational proof provides a weaker bound than does the original result . An elementary proof of the Shapley – Folkman lemma in finite @-@ dimensional space can be found in the book by <unk> together with applications in estimating the duality gap in separable optimization problems and zero @-@ sum games .

 The Shapley – Folkman lemma enables researchers to extend results for Minkowski sums of convex sets to sums of general sets , which need not be convex . Such sums of sets arise in economics , in mathematical optimization , and in probability theory ; in each of these three mathematical sciences , non @-@ convexity is an important feature of applications . 
 = = = Economics = = = 
 In economics , a consumer 's preferences are defined over all " baskets " of goods . Each basket is represented as a non @-@ negative vector , whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods . On this set of baskets , an indifference curve is defined for each consumer ; a consumer 's indifference curve contains all the baskets of commodities that the consumer regards as equivalent : That is , for every pair of baskets on the same indifference curve , the consumer does not prefer one basket over another . Through each basket of commodities passes one indifference curve . A consumer 's preference set ( relative to an indifference curve ) is the union of the indifference curve and all the commodity baskets that the consumer prefers over the indifference curve . A consumer 's preferences are convex if all such preference sets are convex . 
 An optimal basket of goods occurs where the budget @-@ line supports a consumer 's preference set , as shown in the diagram . This means that an optimal basket is on the highest possible indifference curve given the budget @-@ line , which is defined in terms of a price vector and the consumer 's income ( endowment vector ) . Thus , the set of optimal baskets is a function of the prices , and this function is called the consumer 's demand . If the preference set is convex , then at every price the consumer 's demand is a convex set , for example , a unique optimal basket or a line @-@ segment of baskets . 
 = = = = Non @-@ convex preferences = = = = 
 However , if a preference set is non @-@ convex , then some prices determine a budget @-@ line that supports two separate optimal @-@ baskets . For example , we can imagine that , for zoos , a lion costs as much as an eagle , and further that a zoo 's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion . We can suppose also that a zoo @-@ keeper views either animal as equally valuable . In this case , the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle . Of course , a contemporary zoo @-@ keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion ( or a griffin ) ! Thus , the zoo @-@ keeper 's preferences are non @-@ convex : The zoo @-@ keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both . 
 When the consumer 's preference set is non @-@ convex , then ( for some prices ) the consumer 's demand is not connected ; a disconnected demand implies some discontinuous behavior by the consumer , as discussed by Harold Hotelling : 
 If indifference curves for purchases be thought of as possessing a wavy character , convex to the origin in some regions and concave in others , we are forced to the conclusion that it is only the portions convex to the origin that can be regarded as possessing any importance , since the others are essentially unobservable . They can be detected only by the discontinuities that may occur in demand with variation in price @-@ ratios , leading to an abrupt jumping of a point of tangency across a chasm when the straight line is rotated . But , while such discontinuities may reveal the existence of chasms , they can never measure their depth . The concave portions of the indifference curves and their many @-@ dimensional generalizations , if they exist , must forever remain in <unk> obscurity . 
 The difficulties of studying non @-@ convex preferences were emphasized by Herman Wold and again by Paul Samuelson , who wrote that non @-@ convexities are " shrouded in eternal darkness ... " , according to <unk> . 
 Nonetheless , non @-@ convex preferences were illuminated from 1959 to 1961 by a sequence of papers in The Journal of Political Economy ( JPE ) . The main contributors were Farrell , Bator , Koopmans , and Rothenberg . In particular , Rothenberg 's paper discussed the approximate convexity of sums of non @-@ convex sets . These JPE @-@ papers stimulated a paper by Lloyd Shapley and Martin Shubik , which considered convexified consumer @-@ preferences and introduced the concept of an " approximate equilibrium " . The JPE @-@ papers and the Shapley – Shubik paper influenced another notion of " quasi @-@ equilibria " , due to Robert Aumann .

 Previous publications on non @-@ convexity and economics were collected in an annotated bibliography by Kenneth Arrow . He gave the bibliography to Starr , who was then an undergraduate enrolled in Arrow 's ( graduate ) advanced mathematical @-@ economics course . In his term @-@ paper , Starr studied the general equilibria of an artificial economy in which non @-@ convex preferences were replaced by their convex hulls . In the convexified economy , at each price , the aggregate demand was the sum of convex hulls of the consumers ' demands . Starr 's ideas interested the mathematicians Lloyd Shapley and Jon Folkman , who proved their eponymous lemma and theorem in " private correspondence " , which was reported by Starr 's published paper of 1969 . 
 In his 1969 publication , Starr applied the Shapley – Folkman – Starr theorem . Starr proved that the " convexified " economy has general equilibria that can be closely approximated by " quasi @-@ equilibria " of the original economy , when the number of agents exceeds the dimension of the goods : Concretely , Starr proved that there exists at least one quasi @-@ equilibrium of prices popt with the following properties : 
 For each quasi @-@ equilibrium 's prices popt , all consumers can choose optimal baskets ( maximally preferred and meeting their budget constraints ) . 
 At quasi @-@ equilibrium prices popt in the convexified economy , every good 's market is in equilibrium : Its supply equals its demand . 
 For each quasi @-@ equilibrium , the prices " nearly clear " the markets for the original economy : an upper bound on the distance between the set of equilibria of the " convexified " economy and the set of quasi @-@ equilibria of the original economy followed from Starr 's corollary to the Shapley – Folkman theorem . 
 Starr established that 
 " in the aggregate , the discrepancy between an allocation in the fictitious economy generated by [ taking the convex hulls of all of the consumption and production sets ] and some allocation in the real economy is bounded in a way that is independent of the number of economic agents . Therefore , the average agent experiences a deviation from intended actions that vanishes in significance as the number of agents goes to infinity " . 
 Following Starr 's 1969 paper , the Shapley – Folkman – Starr results have been widely used in economic theory . Roger Guesnerie summarized their economic implications : " Some key results obtained under the convexity assumption remain ( approximately ) relevant in circumstances where convexity fails . For example , in economies with a large consumption side , preference <unk> do not destroy the standard results " . " The derivation of these results in general form has been one of the major achievements of postwar economic theory " , wrote Guesnerie . The topic of non @-@ convex sets in economics has been studied by many Nobel laureates : Arrow ( 1972 ) , Robert Aumann ( 2005 ) , Gérard Debreu ( 1983 ) , Tjalling Koopmans ( 1975 ) , Paul Krugman ( 2008 ) , and Paul Samuelson ( 1970 ) ; the complementary topic of convex sets in economics has been emphasized by these laureates , along with Leonid Hurwicz , Leonid Kantorovich ( 1975 ) , and Robert Solow ( 1987 ) . The Shapley – Folkman – Starr results have been featured in the economics literature : in microeconomics , in general @-@ equilibrium theory , in public economics ( including market failures ) , as well as in game theory , in mathematical economics , and in applied mathematics ( for economists ) . The Shapley – Folkman – Starr results have also influenced economics research using measure and integration theory .

 The Shapley – Folkman lemma has been used to explain why large minimization problems with non @-@ convexities can be nearly solved ( with iterative methods whose convergence proofs are stated for only convex problems ) . The Shapley – Folkman lemma has encouraged the use of methods of convex minimization on other applications with sums of many functions . 
 = = = = Preliminaries of optimization theory = = = = 
 Nonlinear optimization relies on the following definitions for functions : 
 The graph of a function f is the set of the pairs of arguments x and function evaluations f ( x ) 
 Graph ( f ) 
 = { ( x , f ( x ) ) } 
 The epigraph of a real @-@ valued function f is the set of points above the graph 
 Epi ( f ) = 
 { ( x , u ) : f ( x ) ≤ u } . 
 A real @-@ valued function is defined to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set . 
 For example , the quadratic function f ( x ) 
 = x2 is convex , as is the absolute value function g ( x ) = 
 | x | . However , the sine function ( pictured ) is non @-@ convex on the interval ( 0 , π ) . 
 = = = = Additive optimization problems = = = = 
 In many optimization problems , the objective function f is separable : that is , f is the sum of many summand @-@ functions , each of which has its own argument : 
 f ( x ) 
 = f ( ( x1 , ... , xN ) ) = 
 ∑ fn ( xn ) . 
 For example , problems of linear optimization are separable . Given a separable problem with an optimal solution , we fix an optimal solution 
 xmin = ( x1 , ... , xN ) min 
 with the minimum value f ( xmin ) . For this separable problem , we also consider an optimal solution ( xmin , f ( xmin ) ) to the " convexified problem " , where convex hulls are taken of the graphs of the summand functions . Such an optimal solution is the limit of a sequence of points in the convexified problem 
 ( xj , f ( xj ) ) ∈ ∑ Conv ( Graph ( fn ) ) . 
 Of course , the given optimal @-@ point is a sum of points in the graphs of the original summands and of a small number of convexified summands , by the Shapley – Folkman lemma . 
 This analysis was published by Ivar Ekeland in 1974 to explain the apparent convexity of separable problems with many summands , despite the non @-@ convexity of the summand problems . In 1973 , the young mathematician Claude Lemaréchal was surprised by his success with convex minimization methods on problems that were known to be non @-@ convex ; for minimizing nonlinear problems , a solution of the dual problem problem need not provide useful information for solving the primal problem , unless the primal problem be convex and satisfy a constraint qualification . Lemaréchal 's problem was additively separable , and each summand function was non @-@ convex ; nonetheless , a solution to the dual problem provided a close approximation to the primal problem 's optimal value . Ekeland 's analysis explained the success of methods of convex minimization on large and separable problems , despite the non @-@ convexities of the summand functions . Ekeland and later authors argued that additive <unk> produced an approximately convex aggregate problem , even though the summand functions were non @-@ convex . The crucial step in these publications is the use of the Shapley – Folkman lemma . The Shapley – Folkman lemma has encouraged the use of methods of convex minimization on other applications with sums of many functions .
