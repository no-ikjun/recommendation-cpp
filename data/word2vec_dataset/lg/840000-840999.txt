 The bill , proposed in the New Jersey State Senate passed in the senate with 21 votes supporting it and 19 abstentions . It passed the General Assembly by a 69 @-@ 2 vote . This act was subsequently signed into law by Governor McGreevey on July 2 , 2003 and it became effective immediately . Baraka ceased being poet laureate on that date . 
 Baraka proceeded to file a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § § 1983 and 1988 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to challenge his dismissal and the elimination of the post supported by allegations that his free speech rights had been violated and alleged that McGreevey and other state officials had retaliated against him . However , U.S. District Court Judge Garrett E. Brown , Jr . , dismissed Baraka 's claim citing that he failed to state a grounds on which relief could be granted and under the state 's legislative immunity protections provided by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution . On March 21 , 2007 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the lower court 's decision and ruled that state officials were immune from such suits . This appellate decision further stated that " Baraka , like any person , was free to speak his views . But he had no protected legal interest in the maintenance of the position of poet laureate of New Jersey . " Without providing comment and affirming the Third Circuit 's decision , the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case by denying Baraka 's Petition for a Writ for Certiorari .

 = Diving cylinder = 
 A diving cylinder , scuba tank or diving tank is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set . It may also be used for surface @-@ supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba . Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather . 
 Diving cylinders are usually manufactured from aluminium or steel alloys , and are normally fitted with one of two common types of cylinder valve for filling and connection to the regulator . Other accessories such as manifolds , cylinder bands , protective nets and boots and carrying handles may be provided . Various configurations of harness may be used to carry the cylinder or cylinders while diving , depending on the application . Cylinders used for scuba typically have an internal volume ( known as water capacity ) of between 3 and 18 litres ( 0 @.@ 11 and 0 @.@ 64 cu ft ) and a maximum working pressure rating from 184 to 300 bars ( 2 @,@ 670 to 4 @,@ 350 psi ) . Cylinders are also available in smaller sizes , such as 0 @.@ 5 , 1 @.@ 5 and 2 litres , however these are often not used for breathing , instead being used for purposes such as inflation of surface marker buoys , <unk> and buoyancy <unk> . Scuba divers may dive with a single cylinder , a pair of similar cylinders , or a main cylinder and a smaller " pony " cylinder , usually carried on the diver 's back . For specialised diving , more that two cylinders may be needed , or the cylinders may be mounted at the waist ( " side @-@ mount " ) . 
 When pressurised , a cylinder carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity , because the gas is compressed to several hundred times atmospheric pressure . The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation is based on the amount of gas required to safely complete the dive . Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air , but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher pressure , divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air . A cylinder containing such mixtures needs to be labelled to indicate its contents for safety reasons . Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling , recording of contents , and labelling for diving cylinders . Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory to ensure the safety of operators of filling stations . <unk> diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation , and regional and international rules for colouring and labelling may also apply . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 The term " diving cylinder " tends to be used by gas equipment engineers , manufacturers , support professionals , and divers speaking British English . " Scuba tank " or " diving tank " is more often used colloquially by non @-@ professionals and native speakers of American English . The term " oxygen tank " is commonly used by non @-@ divers when referring to diving cylinders ; however , this is a misnomer . These cylinders typically contain ( compressed atmospheric ) breathing air , or an oxygen @-@ enriched air mix . They rarely contain pure oxygen , except when used for rebreather diving , shallow decompression stops in technical diving or for in @-@ water oxygen recompression therapy . Breathing pure oxygen at depths greater than 6 metres ( 20 ft ) , equivalent to a partial pressure of oxygen of 1 @.@ 6 bars ( 1 @.@ 6 atm ) , can result in oxygen toxicity , a highly dangerous condition that can trigger seizures and thus lead to drowning . 
 Diving cylinders have also been referred to as bottles or flasks , usually with one of the epithets scuba , diving , or bailout . Cylinders may also be called <unk> , a genericized trademark derived from the Aqua @-@ lung equipment made by the Aqua Lung / La <unk> company , although that is more properly applied to an open circuit scuba set or open circuit diving regulator . 
 Diving cylinders may also be specified by their application , as in bailout cylinders , stage cylinders , deco cylinders , sidemount cylinders , pony cylinders , suit inflation cylinders , etc . 
 = = Parts of a cylinder = = 
 The functional diving cylinder consists of the pressure vessel and a cylinder valve : 
 = = = The pressure vessel = = = 
 The pressure vessel is a seamless cylinder normally made of cold @-@ extruded aluminium or forged steel . <unk> wound composite cylinders are used in fire fighting breathing apparatus and oxygen first aid equipment because of their low weight , but are rarely used for diving , due to their high positive buoyancy . They are occasionally used when portability for accessing the dive site is critical , such as in cave diving . Composite cylinders certified to ISO @-@ <unk> @-@ 2 or ISO @-@ <unk> @-@ 3 may only be used for underwater applications if they are manufactured in accordance with the requirements for underwater use and are marked “ UW ” . 
 = = = = Aluminium cylinders = = = = 
 An especially common cylinder provided at tropical dive resorts is the " aluminium @-@ S80 " which is an aluminium cylinder design with an internal volume of 0 @.@ 39 cubic feet ( 11 @.@ 0 L ) rated to hold a nominal volume of 80 cubic feet ( 2 @,@ 300 L ) of atmospheric pressure gas at its rated working pressure of 3 @,@ 000 pounds per square inch ( 207 bar ) . Aluminium cylinders are also often used where divers carry many cylinders , such as in technical diving in water which is warm enough that the dive suit does not provide much buoyancy , because the greater buoyancy of aluminium cylinders reduces the amount of extra buoyancy the diver would need to achieve neutral buoyancy . They are also sometimes preferred when carried as " sidemount " or " sling " cylinders as the near neutral buoyancy allows them to hang comfortably along the sides of the diver 's body , without disturbing trim , and they can be handed off to another diver or stage dropped with a minimal effect on buoyancy . Most aluminium cylinders are flat bottomed , allowing then to stand upright on a level surface , but some were manufactured with domed bottoms . 
 The aluminium alloys used for diving cylinders are 6061 and 6351 . 6351 alloy is subject to sustained load cracking and cylinders manufactured of this alloy should be periodically eddy current tested according to national legislation and manufacturer 's recommendations . 6351 alloy has been superseded for new manufacture , but many old cylinders are still in service . 
 = = = = = Manufacture = = = = = 
 Aluminium cylinders are usually manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets in a process which first presses the walls and base , then trims the top edge of the cylinder walls , followed by press forming the shoulder and neck . The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface , boring and cutting the neck threads and O @-@ ring groove . The cylinder is then heat @-@ treated , tested and stamped with the required permanent markings . Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases , which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces , and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear . This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength , but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy . 
 = = = = Steel cylinders = = = = 
 In cold water diving , where a diver wearing a highly buoyant thermally insulating dive suit has a large excess of buoyancy , steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders . They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity , due to considerably higher material strength , so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity , a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver . 
 Steel cylinders are more susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion , particularly in seawater , and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage . It is not difficult to monitor external corrosion , and repair the paint when damaged , and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life , often longer than aluminium cylinders , as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits . 
 Steel cylinders are manufactured with domed ( convex ) and dished ( concave ) bottoms . The dished profile allows them to stand upright on a horizontal surface , and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders . The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape , and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ( " J " ) . Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass , and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity , though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba . 
 = = = = = Manufacture = = = = = 
 Steel alloys used for dive cylinder manufacture are authorised by the manufacturing standard . For example , the US standard DOT <unk> requires the use of open @-@ hearth , basic oxygen , or electric steel of uniform quality . Approved alloys include <unk> , NE @-@ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Carbon @-@ boron and Intermediate manganese , with specified constituents , including manganese and carbon , and molybdenum , chromium , boron , nickel or zirconium . 
 Steel cylinders may be manufactured from steel plate discs , which are cold drawn to a cylindrical cup form , in two or three stages , and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market , so they cannot stand up by themselves . After forming the base and side walls , the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length , heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck . This process thickens the material of the shoulder . The cylinder is heat @-@ treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness . The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o @-@ ring seat ( if applicable ) , then chemically cleaned or shot @-@ blasted inside and out to remove mill @-@ scale . After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings , followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising . 
 = = = = Cylinder neck = = = = 
 The neck of the cylinder is internally threaded to fit a cylinder valve . There are several standards for neck threads , these include : 
 Taper thread ( 17E ) , with a 12 % taper right hand thread , standard Whitworth 55 ° form with a pitch of 14 threads per inch ( 5 @.@ 5 threads per cm ) and pitch diameter at the top thread of the cylinder of 18 @.@ 036 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) . These connections are sealed using thread tape and torqued to between 120 and 150 newton metres ( 89 and 111 lbf · ft ) on steel cylinders , and between 75 and 140 N · m ( 55 and 103 lbf · ft ) on aluminium cylinders . 
 Parallel threads are made to several standards : 
 <unk> ISO parallel thread , which is sealed by an O @-@ ring and torqued to 100 to 130 N · m ( 74 to 96 lbf · ft ) on steel , and 95 to 130 N · m ( 70 to 96 lbf · ft ) on aluminium cylinders ; 
 <unk> parallel thread , which is sealed by an O @-@ ring , and torqued to 100 to 130 N · m ( 74 to 96 lbf · ft ) on steel cylinders , and 85 to 100 N · m ( 63 to 74 lbf · ft ) on aluminium cylinders ; 
 3 / 4 " <unk> BSP parallel thread , which has a 55 ° Whitworth thread form , a pitch diameter of 25 @.@ 279 millimetres ( 0 @.@ <unk> in ) and a pitch of 14 threads per inch ( 1 @.@ 814 mm ) ; 
 3 / 4 " <unk> NGS ( <unk> ) parallel thread , sealed by an O @-@ ring , torqued to 40 to 50 N · m ( 30 to 37 lbf · ft ) on aluminium cylinders , which has a 60 ° thread form , a pitch diameter of 0 @.@ <unk> to 0 @.@ <unk> in ( 24 @.@ 94 to 25 @.@ 08 mm ) , and a pitch of 14 threads per inch ( 5 @.@ 5 threads per cm ) ; 
 3 / 4 " x16 <unk> , sealed by an O @-@ ring , torqued to 40 to 50 N · m ( 30 to 37 lbf · ft ) on aluminium cylinders . 
 The 3 / 4 " NGS and 3 / 4 " BSP are very similar , having the same pitch and a pitch diameter that only differs by about 0 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 008 in ) , but they are not compatible , as the thread forms are different . 
 All parallel thread valves are sealed using an O @-@ ring at top of the neck thread which seals in a chamfer or step in the cylinder neck and against the flange of the valve . 
 The shoulder of the cylinder carries stamp markings providing required information about the cylinder . 
 = = = The cylinder valve = = = 
 The purpose of the cylinder valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow to and from the pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose . Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome @-@ plating . A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed into the bottom of the valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted , and blocking or jamming the regulator . Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening , but some have an integral filter . 
 Cylinder valves are classified by four basic aspects : The cylinder thread specification , the connection to the regulator , pressure rating , and other distinguishing features . 
 = = = = Cylinder thread variations = = = = 
 Cylinder threads may be in two basic configurations : Taper thread and parallel thread . These thread specifications are detailed in a previous section . The valve thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the cylinder . <unk> matched neck threads can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences if someone is hit by the flying valve or cylinder . 
 = = = = Connection to the regulator = = = = 
 A rubber o @-@ ring forms a seal between the metal of the pillar valve and the metal of the diving regulator . <unk> ( e.g. <unk> ) O @-@ rings may be used with cylinders storing oxygen @-@ rich gas mixtures to reduce the risk of fire . There are two basic types of cylinder valve to regulator connection in general use for Scuba cylinders containing air : 
 A @-@ clamp or yoke connectors - the connection on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O @-@ ring of the pillar valve against the input seat of the regulator . The connection is officially described as connection CGA 850 yoke . The yoke is screwed down snug by hand ( <unk> can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools ) and the seal is created by clamping the O @-@ ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve . When the valve is opened , cylinder pressure expands the O @-@ ring against the outer surface of the O @-@ ring groove in the valve . Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O @-@ ring between the valve and regulator faces , resulting in a leak . This type of connection is simple , cheap and very widely used worldwide . It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal , the O @-@ ring , is not well protected from <unk> . 
 DIN screw thread connectors - the regulator screws into the cylinder valve trapping the O @-@ ring securely between the sealing face of the valve and the O @-@ ring groove in the regulator . These are more reliable than A @-@ clamps because the O @-@ ring is well protected , but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors , or cylinders which have DIN fittings , so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor , either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder , or for connecting an A @-@ clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve . 
 There are also cylinder valves for scuba cylinders containing gases other than air : 
 The new European Norm EN 144 @-@ 3 : 2003 introduced a new type of valve , similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves , however , with a metric M26 × 2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator . These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth 's atmosphere ( i.e. 22 – 100 % ) . From August 2008 , these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen . The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean . However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen @-@ clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked . 
 An M <unk> male thread cylinder valve was supplied with some Dräger semi @-@ closed circuit recreational rebreathers ( Dräger Ray ) for use with nitrox mixtures . The regulator supplied with the rebreather had a compatible connection . 
 = = = = Pressure rating = = = = 
 Yoke valves are rated between 200 and 240 bar , and there does not appear to be any mechanical design detail preventing connection between any yoke fittings , though some older yoke clamps will not fit over the popular 232 / 240 bar combination DIN / yoke cylinder valve as the yoke is too narrow . 
 DIN valves are produced in 200 bar and 300 bar pressure ratings . The number of threads and the detail configuration of the connections is designed to prevent incompatible combinations of filler attachment or regulator attachment with the cylinder valve . 
 232 bar DIN ( 5 @-@ thread , G5 / 8 ) Outlet / Connector # 13 to DIN 477 part 1 - ( technically they are specified for cylinders with 300 bar test pressure ) 
 300 bar DIN ( 7 @-@ thread , G5 / 8 ) Outlet / Connector # 56 to DIN 477 part 5 - these are similar to 5 @-@ thread DIN fitting but are rated to 300 bar working pressures . ( technically they are specified for cylinders with 450 bar test pressure ) . The 300 bar pressures are common in European diving and in US cave diving . 
 <unk> are available to allow connection of DIN regulators to yoke cylinder valves ( A @-@ clamp or yoke adaptor ) , and to connect yoke regulators to DIN cylinder valves . ( plug adaptors and block adaptors ) Plug adaptors are rated for 232 / 240 bar , and can only be used with valves which are designed to accept them . Block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar , and can be used with almost any 200 bar DIN valve . 
 = = = = Other distinguishing features = = = = 
 = = = = = Plain valves = = = = = 
 The most commonly used cylinder valve type is the single outlet plain valve , sometimes known as a " K " valve , which allows connection of a single regulator , and has no reserve function . It simply opens to allow gas flow , or closes to shut it off . Several configurations are used , with options of DIN or A @-@ clamp connection , and vertical or transverse spindle arrangements . The valve is operated by turning a knob , usually rubber or plastic , which affords a comfortable grip . Several turns are required to fully open the valves . Some DIN valves are convertible to A @-@ clamp by use of an insert which is screwed into the opening . 
 Y and H cylinder valves have two outlets , each with its own valve , allowing two regulators to be connected to the cylinder . If one regulator " <unk> " , which is a common failure mode , or ices up , which can happen in water below about 5 ° C , its valve can be closed and the cylinder breathed from the regulator connected to the other valve . The difference between an H @-@ valve and a Y @-@ valve is that the Y @-@ valve body splits into two posts roughly 90 ° to each other and 45 ° from the vertical axis , looking like a Y , while an H @-@ valve is usually assembled from a valve designed as part of a manifold system with an additional valve post connected to the manifold socket , with the valve posts parallel and vertical , which looks a bit like an H. Y @-@ valves are also known as " slingshot valves " due to their appearance . 
 = = = = = Reserve valves = = = = = 
 Reserve lever or " J @-@ valve " . Until the 1970s , when submersible pressure gauges on regulators came into common use , diving cylinders often used a mechanical reserve mechanism to indicate to the diver that the cylinder was nearly empty . The gas supply was automatically cut @-@ off by a spring loaded valve when the gas pressure reached the reserve pressure . To release the reserve , the diver pulled down on a rod that ran along the side of the cylinder and which activated a lever to open a bypass valve . The diver would then finish the dive before the reserve ( typically 300 pounds per square inch ( 21 bar ) ) was consumed . On occasion , divers would inadvertently trigger the mechanism while donning gear or performing a movement underwater and , not realizing that the reserve had already been accessed , could find themselves out of air at depth with no warning whatsoever . The J @-@ valve got its name from being item " J " in one of the first scuba equipment manufacturer catalogs . The standard non @-@ reserve yoke valve at the time was item " K " , and is often still referred to as a K @-@ valve . J @-@ valves are still occasionally used by professional divers in zero visibility , where the submersible pressure gauge ( SPG ) can not be read . While the recreational diving industry has largely discontinued support and sales of the J @-@ valve , the US Department of Defense , the US Navy , NOAA ( the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ) and OSHA ( the national Occupational Health and Safety Administration ) all still allow or recommend the use of J @-@ valves as an alternative to a bailout cylinder or as an alternative to a submersible pressure gauge . They are generally not available through recreational dive shops , but are still available from some manufacturers . They can be significantly more expensive than K @-@ valves from the same manufacturer . 
 Less common in the 1950s thru 1970s was an R @-@ valve which was equipped with a restriction that caused breathing to become difficult as the cylinder neared exhaustion , but that would allow less restricted breathing if the diver began to ascend and the ambient water pressure lessened , providing a larger pressure differential over the orifice . It was never particularly popular because , were it necessary for the diver to descend ( as is often necessary in cave and wreck diving , breathing would become progressively more difficult as the diver went deeper , eventually becoming impossible until the diver could ascent to a low enough ambient pressure . 
 = = = = = Handed valves = = = = = 
 Some cylinder valve models have axial spindles - in line with the cylinder axis , and are not handed . Standard side @-@ spindle valves have the handwheel on the diver 's right side when back @-@ mounted . Side @-@ spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the handwheel to the right and the other with the handwheel to the left , but in all cases the valve is opened by turning the handwheel anticlockwise , and closed by turning it clockwise . This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes . Left hand side @-@ spindle valves are used by sidemount divers . 
 = = = = = <unk> disk = = = = = 
 Some national standards require that the cylinder valve includes a bursting disk , a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the cylinder fails in the event of <unk> . If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time . The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc , in good condition , on a correctly filled cylinder is very low . 
 = = = Accessories = = = 
 Additional components for convenience , protection or other functions , not directly required for the function as a pressure vessel . 
 = = = = Manifolds = = = = 
 A cylinder manifold is a tube which connects two cylinders together so that the contents of both can be supplied to one or more regulators . There are three commonly used configurations of manifold : 
 The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which is attached to the cylinder valve outlet , and an outlet connection in the middle , to which the regulator is attached . A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector . The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed , and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised . 
 More recently , manifolds have become available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder side of the valve , leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator . This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised , as there is no valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder . This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder , and isolated from the internal pressure independently , which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders . 
 These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold , which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other . This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread , manifold connection , or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost . 
 A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders , and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator . These manifolds can include a reserve valve , either in the main valve or at one cylinder . This system is mainly of historical interest . 
 = = = = Valve cage = = = = 
 Also known as a manifold cage or regulator cage , this is a structure which can be clamped to the neck or shoulder of the cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead . A valve cage is often made of stainless steel , and some designs can snag on obstructions . 
 = = = = Cylinder bands = = = = 
 Cylinder bands are straps , usually of stainless steel , which are used to clamp two cylinders together as a twin set . The cylinders may be manifolded or independent . It is usual to use a cylinder band near the top of the cylinder , just below the shoulders , and one lower down . The conventional distance between <unk> for bolting to a backplate is 11 inches ( 280 mm ) . 
 = = = = Cylinder boot = = = = 
 A cylinder boot is a hard rubber or plastic cover which fits over the base of a diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact , to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder , and in the case of round bottomed cylinders , to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base . Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface . It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder , and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition , the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas . This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place . The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver , but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment . 
 = = = = Cylinder net = = = = 
 A cylinder net is a tubular net which is stretched over a cylinder and tied on at top and bottom . The function is to protect the paintwork from scratching , and on booted cylinders it also helps drain the surface between the boot and cylinder , which reduces corrosion problems under the boot . Mesh size is usually about 6 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) . Some divers will not use boots or nets as they can snag more easily than a bare cylinder and constitute an entrapment hazard in some environments such as caves and the interior of wrecks . Occasionally sleeves made from other materials may be used to protect the cylinder . 
 = = = = Cylinder handle = = = = 
 A cylinder handle may be fitted , usually clamped to the neck , to conveniently carry the cylinder . This can also increase the risk of snagging in an enclosed environment . 
 = = = = Dust caps and plugs = = = = 
 These are used to cover the cylinder valve orifice when the cylinder is not in use to prevent dust , water or other materials from contaminating the orifice . They can also help prevent the O @-@ ring of a yoke type valve from falling out . The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from the cylinder does not pressurise the plug , making it difficult to remove . 
 = = Cylinder pressure rating = = 
 The thickness of the cylinder walls is directly related to the working pressure , and this affects the buoyancy characteristics of the cylinder . A low @-@ pressure cylinder will be more buoyant than a high @-@ pressure cylinder with similar size and proportions of length to diameter and in the same alloy . 
 = = = Working pressure = = = 
 Scuba cylinders are technically all high @-@ pressure gas containers , but within the industry in the US there are three nominal working pressure ratings ( WP ) in common use ; 
 low pressure ( 2400 to <unk> psi — 165 to 182 bar ) , 
 standard ( 3000 psi — 207 bar ) , and 
 high pressure ( 3300 to 3500 psi — 227 to 241 bar ) . 
 US made aluminum cylinders usually have a standard working pressure of 3 @,@ 000 pounds per square inch ( 210 bar ) , and the compact aluminum range have a working pressure of 3 @,@ 300 pounds per square inch ( 230 bar ) . Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10 % and this is indicated by a ' + ' symbol . This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate higher standard periodical hydrostatic test . 
 Those parts of the world using the metric system usually refer to the cylinder pressure directly in bar but would generally use " high pressure " to refer to a 300 bars ( 4 @,@ 400 psi ) working pressure cylinder , which can not be used with a yoke connector on the regulator . 232 bar is a very popular working pressure for scuba cylinders in both steel and aluminium . 
 = = = Test pressure = = = 
 Hydrostatic test pressure ( TP ) is specified by the manufacturing standard . This is usually 1 @.@ 5 × working pressure , or in the USA , 1 @.@ 67 × working pressure . 
 = = = Developed pressure = = = 
 Cylinder working pressure is specified at a reference temperature , usually 15 ° C or 20 ° C. and cylinders also have a specified maximum safe working temperature , often 65 ° C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature , as described by the gas laws , but this is acceptable in terms of the standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified working pressure stamped on the cylinder . This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature , but not more than 65 ° C , provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature , and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature . 
 = = = Pressure monitoring = = = 
 The internal pressure of a diving cylinder is measured at several stages during use . It is checked before filling , monitored during filling and checked when filling is completed . This can all be done with the pressure gauge on the filling equipment . 
 Pressure is also generally monitored by the diver . Firstly as a check of contents before use , then during use to ensure that there is enough left at all times to allow a safe completion of the dive , and often after a dive for purposes of record keeping and personal consumption rate calculation . 
 The pressure is also monitored during hydrostatic testing to ensure that the test is done to the correct pressure . 
 Most diving cylinders do not have a dedicated pressure gauge , but this is a standard feature on most diving regulators , and a requirement on all filling facilities . 
 There are two widespread standards for pressure measurement of diving gas . In the USA and perhaps a few other places the pressure is measured in pounds per square inch ( psi ) , and the rest of the world uses bar . Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units , such as <unk> ( kPa ) or <unk> ( MPa ) , or in atmospheres ( atm , or ATA ) , particularly gauges not actually used underwater . 
 = = Cylinder capacity = = 
 There are two commonly used conventions for describing the capacity of a diving cylinder . One is based on the internal volume of the cylinder . The other is based on nominal volume of gas stored . 
 = = = Internal volume = = = 
 The internal volume is commonly quoted in most countries using the metric system . This information is required by ISO <unk> to be stamped on the cylinder shoulder . It can be measured easily by filling the cylinder with fresh water . This has resulted in the term ' water capacity ' , abbreviated as WC which is often marked on the cylinder shoulder .

 = = = Nominal volume of gas stored = = = 
 The nominal volume of gas stored is commonly quoted as the cylinder capacity in the USA . It is a measure of the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure . Terms used for the capacity include ' free gas volume ' or ' free gas equivalent ' . It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder . If the working pressure is higher , the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume . 
 The nominal working pressure is not necessarily the same as the actual working pressure used . Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10 % and this is indicated by a ' + ' symbol . This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not necessarily valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards . The nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10 % higher pressure . 
 For example , common Aluminum 80 ( <unk> ) cylinder is an aluminum cylinder which has a nominal ' free gas ' capacity of 80 cubic feet ( 2 @,@ 300 L ) when pressurized to 3 @,@ 000 pounds per square inch ( 210 bar ) . It has an internal volume of 10 @.@ 94 litres ( 0 @.@ 386 cu ft ) .

 Aluminum C100 ia a large ( <unk> l ) , high pressure ( 3 @,@ 300 pounds per square inch ( 228 bar ) ) cylinder . Heavy at 42 @.@ 0 pounds ( 19 @.@ 1 kg ) . 
 Aluminum S80 is probably the most ubiquitous cylinder , used by resorts in many parts of the world for back gas , but also popular as a sling cylinder for decompression gas , and as side @-@ mount cylinder in fresh water , as it has nearly neutral buoyancy . These cylinders have an internal volume of approximately 11 litres ( 0 @.@ 39 cu ft ) and working pressure of 3 @,@ 000 pounds per square inch ( 207 bar ) . They are also sometimes used as manifolded twins for back mount , but in this application the diver needs more ballast weights than with most steel cylinders of equivalent capacity . 
 Aluminium <unk> is the high pressure equivalent , with a water capacity of 10 @.@ 3 l and working pressure 3 @,@ 300 pounds per square inch ( 228 bar ) . 
 Aluminum S40 is a popular cylinder for side @-@ mount and sling mount bailout and decompression gas for moderate depths , as it is small diameter and nearly neutral buoyancy , which makes it relatively unobtrusive for this mounting style . Internal volume is approximately 5 @.@ 8 litres ( 0 @.@ 20 cu ft ) and working pressure 3 @,@ 000 pounds per square inch ( 207 bar ) . 
 Aluminum <unk> ( 9 @.@ 0 l ) 3 @,@ 000 pounds per square inch ( 207 bar ) , and steel <unk> ( 8 @.@ 2 l ) are smaller and lighter than the <unk> , but have a lower capacity , and are suitable for smaller divers or shorter dives . 
 Steel <unk> 2 @,@ 640 pounds per square inch ( 182 bar ) and <unk> ( 10 @.@ 1 l ) at 3 @,@ 442 pounds per square inch ( 237 bar ) are both more compact and lighter than the Aluminium S80 and are both negatively buoyant , which reduces the amount of ballast weight required by the diver . 
 Steel <unk> ( 14 @.@ 8 l ) , <unk> ( 15 @.@ 3 l ) and <unk> ( 16 @.@ 0 l ) cylinders provide larger amounts of gas for nitrox or technical diving . 
 = = Applications and configurations of diving cylinders = = 
 Divers may carry one cylinder or multiples , depending on the requirements of the dive . Where diving takes place in low risk areas , where the diver may safely make a free ascent , or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency , recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder . Where diving risks are higher , for example where the visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression diving , and particularly when diving under an overhead , divers routinely carry more than one gas source . 
 Diving cylinders may serve different purposes . One or two cylinders may be used as a primary breathing source which is intended to be breathed from for most of the dive . A smaller cylinder carried in addition to a larger cylinder is called a " pony bottle " . A cylinder to be used purely as an independent safety reserve is called a " bailout bottle " or Emergency Gas Supply ( EGS ) . A pony bottle is commonly used as a bailout bottle , but this would depend on the time required to surface . 
 Divers doing technical diving often carry different gases , each in a separate cylinder , for each phase of the dive : 
 " travel gas " is used during the descent and ascent . It is typically air or nitrox with an oxygen content between 21 % and 40 % . Travel gas is needed when the bottom gas is hypoxic and therefore is unsafe to breathe in shallow water . 
 " bottom gas " is only breathed at depth . It is typically a helium @-@ based gas which is low in oxygen ( below 21 % ) or hypoxic ( below 17 % ) . 
 " deco gas " is used at the decompression stops and is generally one or more nitrox mixes with a high oxygen content , or pure oxygen , to accelerate decompression . 
 a " stage " is a cylinder holding reserve , travel or deco gas . They are usually carried " side slung " , clipped on either side of the diver to the harness of the backplate and wing or buoyancy compensator , rather than on the back , and may be left on the distance line to be picked up for use on return ( stage dropped ) . Commonly divers use aluminium stage cylinders , particularly in fresh water , because they are nearly neutrally buoyant in water and can be removed underwater with less effect on the diver 's overall buoyancy . 
 For safety , divers sometimes carry an additional independent scuba cylinder with its own regulator to mitigate out @-@ of @-@ air emergencies should the primary breathing gas supply fail . For much common recreational diving where a controlled emergency swimming ascent is acceptably safe , this extra equipment is not needed or used . This extra cylinder is known as a bail @-@ out cylinder , and may be carried in several ways , and can be any size that can hold enough gas to get the diver safely back to the surface . 
 = = = Open @-@ circuit scuba = = = 
 For open @-@ circuit scuba divers , there are several options for the combined cylinder and regulator system : 
 Single cylinder consists of a single large cylinder , usually back mounted , with one first @-@ stage regulator , and usually two second @-@ stage regulators . This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply : it has no redundancy in case of failure . If the cylinder or first @-@ stage regulator fails , the diver is totally out of air and faces a life @-@ threatening emergency . Recreational diver training agencies train divers to rely on a buddy to assist them in this situation . The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses . This equipment configuration , although common with entry @-@ level divers and used for most sport diving , is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed , or where there is an overhead environment ( wreck diving , cave diving , or ice diving ) as it provides no functional redundancy . 
 Single cylinder with dual regulators consists of a single large back mounted cylinder , with two first @-@ stage regulators , each with a second @-@ stage regulator . This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required . It is common in continental Europe , especially Germany . The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing . However , it is hard to reach the valves , so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the free @-@ flowing regulator quickly . 
 Main cylinder plus a small independent cylinder : this configuration uses a larger , back mounted main cylinder along with an independent smaller cylinder , often called a " pony " or " bailout cylinder " . The diver has two independent systems , but the total ' breathing system ' is now heavier , and more expensive to buy and maintain . 
 The pony is typically a 2 to 5 litre cylinder . Its capacity determines the depth of dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection . Ponies may be fixed to the diver 's buoyancy compensator ( BC ) or main cylinder behind the diver 's back , or can be clipped to the harness at the diver 's side or chest or carried as a sling cylinder . Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but require that the diver is trained to use them . 
 Another type of small independent air source is a hand @-@ held cylinder filled with about 85 litres ( 3 @.@ 0 cu ft ) of free air with a diving regulator directly attached , such as the Spare Air . This source provides only a few breaths of gas at depth and is most suitable as a shallow water bailout . 
 Independent twin sets or independent doubles consists of two independent cylinders and two regulators , each with a submersible pressure gauge . This system is heavier , more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set . The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder . If this is not done , then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve . Independent twin sets do not work well with air @-@ integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder . The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies . The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver 's back , or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it , and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach . 
 Plain manifolded twin sets , or manifolded doubles with a single regulator , consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves connected by a manifold but only one regulator is attached to the manifold . This makes it relatively simple and cheap but means there is no redundant functionality to the breathing system , only a double gas supply . This arrangement was fairly common in the early days of scuba when low pressure cylinders were manifolded to provide a larger air supply than was possible from the available single cylinders . It is still in use for large capacity bailout sets for deep commercial diving . 
 Isolation manifolded twin sets or manifolded doubles with two regulators , consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves connected by a manifold , with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves . In the event of a problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed . The advantages of this configuration include : a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder ; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders ; thus , no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive ; and in most failure situations , the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks . The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure , and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs . This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving . 
 Sling cylinders are a configuration of independent cylinders used for technical diving . They are independent cylinders with their own regulators and are carried clipped to the harness at the side of the diver . Their purpose may be to carry either stage , travel , decompression , or bailout gas while the back mounted cylinder ( s ) carry bottom gas . Stage cylinders carry gas to extend bottom time , travel gas is used to reach a depth where bottom gas may be safely used if it is hypoxic at the surface , and decompression gas is gas intended to be used during decompression to accelerate the elimination of inert gases . Bailout gas is an emergency supply intended to be used to surface if the main gas supply is lost . 
 Side @-@ mount cylinders are cylinders clipped to the harness at the diver 's sides which carry bottom gas when the diver does not carry back mount cylinders . They may be used in conjunction with other side mounted stage , travel and / or decompression cylinders where necessary . Skilled side @-@ mount divers may carry as many as three cylinders on each side . This configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves . Side mounting is primarily used for technical diving , but is also sometimes used for recreational diving , when a single cylinder may be carried , complete with secondary second stage ( octopus ) regulator , in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Diving cylinders are used in rebreather diving in two roles : 
 As part of the rebreather itself . The rebreather must have at least one source of fresh gas stored in a cylinder ; many have two and some have more cylinders . Due to the lower gas consumption of rebreathers , these cylinders typically are smaller than those used for equivalent open @-@ circuit dives . <unk> may use internal cylinders , or may also be supplied from " off @-@ board " cylinders , which are not directly plumbed into the rebreather , but connected to it by a flexible hose and coupling and usually carried side slung . 
 oxygen rebreathers have an oxygen cylinder 
 semi @-@ closed circuit rebreathers have a cylinder which usually contains nitrox or a helium based gas . 
 closed circuit rebreathers have an oxygen cylinder and a " diluent " cylinder , which contains air , nitrox or a helium based gas . 
 <unk> divers also often carry an external bailout system if the internal diluent cylinder is too small for safe use for bailout for the planned dive . The bailout system is one or more independent breathing gas sources for use if the rebreather should fail : 
 Open @-@ circuit : One or more open circuit scuba sets . The number of open @-@ circuit bailout sets , their capacity and the breathing gases they contain depend on the depth and decompression needs of the dive . So on a deep , technical rebreather dive , the diver will need a bail out " bottom " gas and a bailout " decompression " gas ( es ) . On such a dive , it is usually the capacity and duration of the bailout sets that limits the depth and duration of the dive - not the capacity of the rebreather . 
 Closed @-@ circuit : A second rebreather containing one or more independent diving cylinders for its gas supply . Using another rebreather as a bail @-@ out is possible but uncommon . Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail @-@ out , rebreathers are relatively bulky , complex , vulnerable to damage and require more time to start breathing from , than easy @-@ to @-@ use , instantly available , robust and reliable open @-@ circuit equipment . 
 = = = Surface supplied diver emergency gas supply = = = 
 Surface supplied divers are usually required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient to allow them to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails . The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver 's safety harness , with first stage regulator connected by a low pressure hose to a bailout block , which may be mounted on the side of the helmet or band @-@ mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full @-@ face mask . Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient , plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used . For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell . This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used . 
 = = = Emergency gas supply on diving bells = = = 
 Diving bells are required to carry an on @-@ board supply of breathing gas for use in emergencies . The cylinders are mounted externally as there is insufficient space inside . They are fully immersed in the water during bell operations , and may be considered diving cylinders . 
 = = = Other uses of compressed gas cylinders in diving operations = = = 
 Divers also use gas cylinders above water for storage of oxygen for first aid treatment of diving disorders and as part of storage " banks " for diving air compressor stations , gas blending , surface supplied breathing gas and gas supplies for decompression chambers and saturation systems . Similar cylinders are also used for many purposes not connected to diving . For these applications they are not diving cylinders and may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as cylinders used underwater . 
 = = Gas calculations = = 
 It is necessary to know the approximate length of time that a diver can breathe from a given cylinder so that a safe dive profile can be planned . 
 There are two parts to this problem : The cylinder and the diver . 
 = = = The cylinder 's capacity to store gas = = = 
 Two features of the cylinder determine its gas carrying capacity : 
 cylinder gas pressure : when filled this normally ranges between 200 and 300 bars ( 2 @,@ 900 and 4 @,@ 400 psi ) , but the actual value should be measured for a real situation , as the cylinder may not be full . 
 internal volume : this normally ranges between 3 litres and 18 litres for single cylinders . 
 To calculate the quantity of gas : 
 Volume of gas at atmospheric pressure 
 = ( cylinder volume ) x ( cylinder pressure ) / ( atmospheric pressure ) 
 In those parts of the world using the metric system the calculation is relatively simple as atmospheric pressure may be approximated as 1 bar , So a 12 @-@ litre cylinder at 232 bar would hold almost 12 × 232 / 1 = 
 2 @,@ 784 litres ( 98 @.@ 3 cu ft ) of air at atmospheric pressure ( also known as free air ) . 
 In the US the capacity of a diving cylinder is specified directly in cubic feet of free air at the nominal working pressure , as the calculation from internal volume and working pressure is relatively tedious in imperial units . For <unk> , in the US and in many diving resorts in other countries , one might find aluminum cylinders of US manufacture with an internal capacity of 0 @.@ 39 cubic feet ( 11 L ) filled to a working pressure of 3 @,@ 000 psi ( 210 bar ) ; Taking atmospheric pressure as 14 @.@ 7 psi , this gives 0 @.@ 39 × 3000 / 14 @.@ 7 = 80 ft ³ These cylinders are described as " 80 cubic foot cylinders " , ( the common " aluminum 80 " ) . 
 Up to about 200 bar the ideal gas law remains valid and the relationship between the pressure , size of the cylinder and gas contained in the cylinder is linear ; at higher pressures there is proportionally less gas in the cylinder . A 3 @-@ litre cylinder filled to 300 bar will only carry contain 810 litres ( 29 cu ft ) of atmospheric pressure gas and not the 900 litres expected from the ideal gas law . 
 = = = Diver gas consumption = = = 
 There are three main factors to consider : 
 the rate at which the diver consumes gas , specified as surface air consumption ( SAC ) or respiratory minute volume ( RMV ) of the diver . In normal conditions this will be between 10 and 25 litres per minute ( L / min ) for divers who are not working hard . At times of extreme high work rate , breathing rates can rise to 95 litres per minute . For International Marine Contractors Association ( IMCA ) commercial diving gas planning purposes , a working breathing rate of 40 litres per minute is used , whilst a figure of 50 litres per minute is used for emergencies . RMV is controlled by blood CO2 levels , and is usually independent of oxygen partial pressures , so does not change with depth . The very large range of possible rates of gas consumption results in a significant uncertainty of how long the supply will last , and a conservative approach is required for safety where an immediate access to an alternative breathing gas source is not possible . Scuba divers are expected to monitor the remaining gas pressure sufficiently often that they are aware of how much is still available at all times during a dive . 
 ambient pressure : the depth of the dive determines this . The ambient pressure at the surface is 1 bar ( 15 psi ) at sea level . For every 10 metres ( 33 ft ) in seawater the diver descends , the pressure increases by 1 bar ( 15 psi ) . As a diver goes deeper , the breathing gas is delivered at a pressure equal to ambient water pressure , and the amount of gas used is proportional to the pressure . Thus , it requires twice as much mass of gas to fill the diver 's lungs at 10 metres ( 33 ft ) as it does at the surface , and three times as much at 20 metres ( 66 ft ) . The mass consumption of breathing gas by the diver is similarly affected . 
 time at each depth . ( usually approximated as time at each depth range ) 
 To calculate the quantity of gas consumed : 
 gas consumed 
 = surface air consumption × time × ambient pressure 
 Metric examples : 
 A diver with a RMV of 20 L / min at 30 msw ( 4 bar ) , will consume 20 x 4 x 1 = 
 80 L / min surface equivalent . 
 A diver with a RMV of 40 L / min at 50 msw ( 6 bar ) for 10 minutes will consume 40 x 6 x 10 
 = 2400 litres of free air – the full capacity of a 12 litre 200 bar cylinder . 
 Imperial examples : 
 A diver with a SAC of 0 @.@ 5 cfm ( cubic feet per minute ) at 100 fsw ( 4 ata ) will consume 0 @.@ 5 x 4 x 1 = 
 2 cfm surface equivalent . 
 A diver with a SAC of 1 cfm at 231 fsw ( 8 ata ) for 10 minutes will consume 1 x 8 x 10 = 80 ft3 of free air – the full capacity of an 80 ft3 cylinder 
 Keeping this in mind , it is not hard to see why technical divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers , and commercial divers normally use surface @-@ supplied diving equipment , and only carry scuba as an emergency gas supply . 
 = = = Breathing gas endurance = = = 
 The amount of time that a diver can breathe from a cylinder is also known as air or gas endurance . 
 Absolute maximum breathing duration ( BT ) for a given depth can be calculated as 
 BT 
 = available air / rate of consumption 
 which , using the ideal gas law , is 
 BT = 
 ( available cylinder pressure × cylinder volume ) / ( rate of air consumption at surface ) × ( ambient pressure ) 
 This may be written as 
 ( 1 ) BT 
 = ( PC @-@ PA ) * VC / ( SAC * PA ) 
 with 
 BT = 
 Breathing Time 
 PC 
 = Cylinder Pressure 
 VC = 
 Cylinder internal volume 
 PA 
 = Ambient Pressure 
 SAC = 
 Surface air consumption 
 in any consistent system of units . 
 Ambient pressure ( PA ) is the surrounding water pressure at a given depth and is made up of the sum of the hydrostatic pressure and the air pressure at the surface . It is calculated as 
 ( 2 ) PA 
 = D * g * ρ + atmospheric pressure 
 with 
 D = 
 depth 
 g 
 = Standard gravity 
 ρ = 
 water density 
 in a consistent system of units 
 For metric units , this formula can be approximated by 
 ( 3 ) PA 
 = D / 10 + 1 
 with depth in m and pressure in bar 
 Ambient pressure is deducted from cylinder pressure , as the quantity of air represented by PA can in practice not be used for breathing by the diver as it required to balance the ambient pressure of the water . 
 This formula neglects the cracking pressure required to open both first and second stages of the regulator , and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in the regulator , both of which are variable depending on the design and adjustment of the regulator , and flow rate , which depends on the breathing pattern of the diver and the gas in use . These factors are not easily estimated , so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value . 
 However , in normal diving usage , a reserve is always factored in . The reserve is a proportion of the cylinder pressure which a diver will not plan to use other than in case of emergency . The reserve may be a quarter or a third of the cylinder pressure or it may be a fixed pressure , common examples are 50 bar and 500 psi . The formula above is then modified to give the usable breathing duration as 
 ( 4 ) BT = 
 ( PC @-@ PR ) * VC / ( SAC * PA ) 
 where PR is the reserve pres 
 For example , ( using the first formula ( 1 ) for absolute maximum breathing time ) , a diver at a depth of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020 kg / m ³ ( typical seawater ) , who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute , using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars , can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation . In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly , from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath , a breath which may not be fully drawn . ( There is never any difficulty exhaling ) . The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder . In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder , but the diver is unable to breathe it . Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends , as the ambient pressure is reduced , and even without ascent , in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices ( <unk> ) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve . 
 Using the same conditions and a reserve of 50 bar , the formula ( 4 ) for usable breathing time is follows : 
 Ambient pressure 
 = water pressure + atmospheric pressure = 
 15 msw / 10 bar per msw + 1 
 = 2 @.@ 5 bar 
 Usable pressure = 
 fill pressure - reserve pressure 
 = 200 bar - 50 bar = 
 150 bar 
 Usable air 
 = usable pressure * cylinder capacity = 
 150 bar * 18 litres per bar 
 = 2700 litres 
 Rate of consumption = 
 surface air consumption * ambient pressure 
 = 20 litres per minute per bar * 2 @.@ 5 bar = 
 50 litres / min 
 Usable breathing time 
 = 2700 litres / 50 litres per min = 
 54 minutes 
 This would give a dive time of 54 min at 15 m before reaching the reserve of 50 bar . 
 = = = Reserves = = = 
 It is strongly recommended by diver training organisations and codes of practice that a portion of the usable gas of the cylinder be held aside as a safety reserve . The reserve is designed to provide gas for longer than planned decompression stops or to provide time to resolve underwater emergencies . 
 The size of the reserve depends upon the risks involved during the dive . A deep or decompression dive warrants a greater reserve than a shallow or a no stop dive . In recreational diving for example , it is recommended that the diver plans to surface with a reserve remaining in the cylinder of 500 psi , 50 bar or 25 % of the initial capacity , depending of the teaching of the diver training organisation . This is because recreational divers practicing within " no @-@ decompression " limits can normally make a direct ascent in an emergency . On technical dives where a direct ascent is either impossible ( due to overhead obstructions ) or dangerous ( due to the requirement to make decompression stops ) , divers plan larger margins of safety . The simplest method uses the rule of thirds : one third of the gas supply is planned for the outward journey , one third is for the return journey and one third is a safety reserve . 
 Some training agencies teach the concept of minimum gas , rock bottom gas management or critical pressures which allows a diver to calculate an acceptable reserve to get two divers to the surface in an emergency from any point in the planned dive profile . 
 Professional divers may be required by legislation or industry codes of practice to carry sufficient reserve gas to enable them to reach a place of safety , such as the surface , or a diving bell , based on the planned dive profile . This reserve gas is usually required to be carried as an independent emergency gas supply ( EGS ) , also known as a bailout cylinder , set or bottle . This usually also applies to professional divers using surface @-@ supplied diving equipment . 
 = = = Weight of gas consumed = = = 
 The density of air at sea level and 15 ° C is approximately 1 @.@ 225 kg / m3 . Most full @-@ sized diving cylinders used for open circuit scuba hold more than 2 kilograms ( 4 @.@ 4 lb ) of air when full , and as the air is used , the buoyancy of the cylinder increases by the weight removed . The decrease in external volume of the cylinder due to reduction of internal pressure is relatively small , and can be ignored for practical purposes . 
 As an example , a 12 @-@ litre cylinder may be filled to 230 bar before a dive , and be breathed down to 30 bar before surfacing , using 2 @,@ 400 litres or 2 @.@ 4 m3 of free air . The mass of gas used during the dive will depend on the mixture - if air is assumed , it will be approximately 2 @.@ 9 kilograms ( 6 @.@ 4 lb ) . 
 The loss of the weight of the gas taken from the cylinder makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant . This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant towards the end of the dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder . The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive , and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used . 
 The change in buoyancy of diving cylinder during the dive can be more problematic with side @-@ mounted cylinders , and the actual buoyancy at any point during the dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may be separated from the diver for any reason . Cylinders which will be stage @-@ dropped or handed off to another diver should not change the diver 's buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy compensator . Cylinders with approximately neutral buoyancy when full generally require the least compensation when detached . 
 = = Filling cylinders = = 
 Legal constraints to filling scuba cylinders will vary by jurisdiction . 
 In South Africa cylinders may be filled for commercial purposes by a person who is competent in the use of the filling equipment to be used , who knows the relevant sections of the applicable standards and regulations , and has written permission from the owner of the cylinder to fill it . The cylinder must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled , and the cylinder may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled . An external inspection of the cylinder must be made , and specified details of the cylinder and fill must be recorded . If the fill is of a gas other than air , the analysis of the completed fill must be recorded by the filler and signed by the customer . If the residual pressure in a cylinder presented for filling does not produce a reasonably strong flow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill the cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty , as there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated . 
 Diving cylinders should only be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other breathing gases using gas blending or <unk> techniques . In some jurisdictions , suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information . The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing , and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal . 
 Special precautions need to be taken with gases other than air : 
 oxygen in high concentrations is a major cause of fire and rust . 
 oxygen should be very carefully transferred from one cylinder to another and only ever stored in containers that are cleaned and labeled for oxygen use . 
 gas mixtures containing proportions of oxygen other than 21 % could be extremely dangerous to divers who are unaware of the proportion of oxygen in them . All cylinders should be labeled with their composition . 
 cylinders containing a high oxygen content must be cleaned for the use of oxygen and their valves lubricated only with oxygen service grease to reduce the chance of combustion . 
 Contaminated air at depth can be fatal . Common contaminants are : carbon monoxide - a by @-@ product of combustion , carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism , and oil and lubricants from the compressor . 
 Keeping the cylinder slightly pressurized at all times during storage and transportation reduces the possibility of inadvertently contaminating the inside of the cylinder with corrosive agents , such as sea water , or toxic material , such as oils , poisonous gases , fungi or bacteria . A normal dive will end with some pressure remaining in the cylinder ; if an emergency ascent has been made due to an out @-@ of @-@ gas incident , the cylinder will normally still contain some pressure and unless the cylinder had been submerged deeper than where the last gas was used it is not possible for water to get in during the dive . 
 Contamination by water during filling may be due two two causes . Inadequate filtration and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate , or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant , and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear , which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater . Both cause corrosion , but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly to the extent that it may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period . This problem is exacerbated in hot climates , where chemical reactions are faster , and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked . 
 The blast caused by a sudden release of the gas pressure inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged . The greatest risk of explosion exists while filling , but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated . The cause of failure can range from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion , neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads , or cracking due to fatigue , sustained high stresses , or overheating effects in aluminum . 
 = = Inspection and testing = = 
 Most countries require diving cylinders to be checked on a regular basis . This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test . The inspection and testing requirements for scuba cylinders may be very different from the requirements for other compressed gas containers due to the more corrosive environment . 
 In the United States , an annual visual inspection is not required by the USA DOT , though they do require a hydrostatic test every five years . The visual inspection requirement is a diving industry standard based on observations made during a review by the National Underwater Accident Data Center . 
 In European Union countries a visual inspection is required every 2 @.@ 5 years , and a hydrostatic test every five years . 
 In Norway a hydrostatic test ( including a visual inspection ) is required 3 years after production date , then every 2 years . 
 Legislation in Australia requires that cylinders are <unk> tested every twelve months . 
 In South Africa a hydrostatic test is required every 4 years , and visual inspection every year . Eddy current testing of neck threads must be done according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . 
 A hydrostatic test involves pressurising the cylinder to its test pressure ( usually 5 / 3 or 3 / 2 of the working pressure ) and measuring its volume before and after the test . A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means the cylinder fails the test and must be permanently removed from service . 
 An inspection includes external and internal inspection for damage , corrosion , and correct colour and markings . The failure criteria vary according to the published standards of the relevant authority , but may include inspection for bulges , overheating , dents , gouges , electrical arc scars , pitting , line corrosion , general corrosion , cracks , thread damage , defacing of permanent markings , and colour coding . 
 When a cylinder is manufactured , its specification , including manufacturer , working pressure , test pressure , date of manufacture , capacity and weight are stamped on the cylinder . 
 After a cylinder passes the test , the test date , ( or the test expiry date in some countries such as Germany ) , is punched into the shoulder of the cylinder for easy verification at fill time . There is an international standard for the stamp format . 
 Compressor operators may be required to check these details before filling the cylinder and may refuse to fill non @-@ standard or out @-@ of @-@ test cylinders . 
 = = Safety = = 
 Before any cylinder is filled , verification of testing dates and a visual examination for external damage and corrosion are required by law in some jurisdictions , and are prudent even if not legally required at other places . Test dates can be checked by looking at the visual inspection sticker and the hydro @-@ test date is stamped on top of the cylinder . 
 Before use the user should verify the contents of the cylinder and check the function of the cylinder valve . This is usually done with a regulator connected to control the flow . Pressure and gas mixture are critical information for the diver , and the valve should open freely without sticking or leaks from the spindle seals . Breathing gas bled from a cylinder may be checked for smell . If the gas does not smell right it should not be used . Breathing gas should be almost free of smell , though a very slight aroma of the compressor lubricant is fairly common . No smell of combustion products or volatile hydrocarbons should be discernible . Failure to recognize that the gas was not on or that cylinder was empty by divers conducting a pre @-@ dive evaluation has been noted . 
 A neatly assembled setup , with regulators , gauges , and delicate computers stowed inside the <unk> , or clipped where they will not be walked on , and stowed under the boat bench or secured to a rack , is the practice of a competent diver . 
 As the scuba set is a life support system , no unauthorised person should touch a diver 's gear , even to move it , without their knowledge and approval . 
 Full cylinders should not be exposed to temperatures above 65 ° C and cylinders should not be filled to pressures greater than the developed pressure appropriate to the certified working pressure of the cylinder . 
 Cylinders should be clearly labelled with their current contents . A generic " Nitrox " or " Trimix " label will alert the user that the contents may not be air , and must be analysed before use . In some parts of the world a label is required specifically indicating that the contents are air , and in other places a colour code without additional labels indicates by default that the contents are air . 
 In a fire , the pressure in a gas cylinder rises in direct proportion to its absolute temperature . If the internal pressure exceeds the mechanical limitations of the cylinder and there are no means to safely vent the pressurized gas to the atmosphere , the vessel will fail mechanically . If the vessel contents are <unk> or a contaminant is present this event may result in an explosion . 
 = = = Accidents = = = 
 The major diving accident and fatality research studies that have been conducted globally including work by the Divers Alert Network , the Diving Incident Monitoring Study , and Project <unk> have each identified cases where the mortality was associated with the diving cylinder . 
 Some recorded accidents associated with diving cylinders : 
 Valve ejected due to mix up with valve threads 3 / 4 " <unk> and 3 / 4 " BSP ( F ) caused damage to a dive shop compressor room . 
 Dive Instructor leg nearly amputated by ejected valve while attempting to remove valve from pressurised cylinder . 
 Valve ejected during filling due to thread failure , sank dive boat . <unk> disks in cylinder valves replaced by solid bolts . 
 Filling hose failure severely injured operator when hose hit his face . Wound exposed jaw bone . 14 stitches to close the wound . 
 Cases of lateral <unk> have been reported caused by the handling of diving cylinders . 
 = = = Handling = = = 
 Cylinders should not be left standing unattended unless secured so that they can not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism , and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads . This is more likely with taper thread valves , and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second , and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings . 
 = = = Long term storage = = = 
 Breathing quality gases do not normally deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminium cylinders . Provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion , the stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within the allowed working range for the cylinder , usually below 65 ° C. If there is any doubt , a check of oxygen fraction will indicate whether the gas has changed ( the other components are inert ) . Any unusual smells would be an indication that the cylinder or gas was contaminated at the time of filling . However some authorities recommend releasing most of the contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure . 
 = = = Transportation = = = 
 Diving cylinders are classified by the UN as dangerous goods for transportation purposes ( US : Hazardous materials ) . Selecting the Proper Shipping Name ( well known by the abbreviation PSN ) is a way to help ensure that the dangerous goods offered for transport accurately represent the hazards . 
 IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations ( <unk> ) 55th Edition defines the Proper Shipping Name as " the name to be used to describe a particular article or substance in all shipping documents and notifications and , where appropriate , on <unk> " . 
 The International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code ( <unk> Code ) defines the Proper Shipping Name as " that portion of the entry most accurately describing the goods in the Dangerous Goods List which is shown in upper @-@ case characters ( plus any letters which form an integral part of the name ) . "

 International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air states that provided that pressure in diving cylinders is less than 200 kilopascals ( 2 bar ; 29 psi ) , these can be carried as checked in or carry @-@ on baggage . It maybe necessary to empty the cylinder to verify this . Once emptied , the cylinder valve should be closed to prevent moisture entering the cylinder . Security restrictions implemented by individual countries may further limit or forbid the carriage of some items permitted by ICAO , and airlines and security screening agencies have the right to refuse the carriage of certain items .

 Road transport 
 The 2009 ( amended 2011 ) UK Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of <unk> Pressure Equipment Regulations ( CDG Regulations ) implement the European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road ( ADR ) . Dangerous goods to be carried internationally in road vehicles must comply with standards for the packaging and labelling of the dangerous goods , and appropriate construction and operating standards for the vehicles and crew . 
 The regulations cover transportation of gas cylinders in a vehicle in a commercial environment . Transportation of pressurised diving gas cylinders with a combined water capacity of less than 1000 litres on a vehicle for personal use is exempt from ADR . 
 Transport of gas cylinders in a vehicle , for commercial purposes , must follow basic legal safety requirements and , unless specifically exempted , must comply with ADR . The driver of the vehicle is legally responsible for the safety of the vehicle and any load being carried , and insurance for the vehicle should include cover for the carriage of dangerous goods . 
 Diving gases , including compressed air , oxygen , nitrox , heliox , trimix , helium and argon , are non @-@ toxic , non flammable , and may be oxidizer or asphyxiant , and are rated in Transport category 3 . The threshold quantity for these gases is 1000 litres combined water capacity of the cylinders . Pressure must be within the rated working pressure of the cylinder . Empty air cylinders at atmospheric pressure are rated in Transport category 4 , and there is no threshold quantity . 
 Commercial loads below the 1000 litres threshold level are exempt from some of the requirements of ADR , but must comply with basic legal and safety requirements , including : 
 Driver training 
 Cylinders should be transported in open vehicles , open containers or trailers , with a gas @-@ tight bulkhead separating driver from load . If cylinders must be carried inside a vehicle it must be well ventilated . 
 Ventilation . Where gas cylinders are carried inside a vehicle , in the same space as people , the windows should be kept open to allow air to circulate . 
 Cylinders must be secured so that they cannot move during transport . They shall not project beyond the sides or ends of the vehicle . It is recommended that cylinders are transported vertically , secured in an appropriate pallet . 
 Cylinder valves must be closed whilst in transit and checked that there are no leaks . Where applicable , protective valve caps and covers should be fitted to cylinders before transporting . Cylinders should not be transported with equipment attached to the valve outlet ( regulators , hoses etc . ) . 
 A fire extinguisher is required on the vehicle . 
 Gas cylinders may only be transported if they are in @-@ date for periodic inspection and test , except they may be transported when out of date for inspection , testing or disposal . 
 Cylinders should be kept cool ( at ambient temperatures ) and not stowed in places where they will be exposed to sources of excessive heat . 
 Product identification labels attached to cylinders to identify the contents and provide safety advice must not be removed or defaced . 
 It is not necessary to mark and label the vehicle if carrying dangerous goods below the threshold level . The use of hazard labels can assist the emergency services , and they may be displayed , but all hazard labels must be removed when the relevant dangerous goods are not being transported . 
 When the journey is complete the gas cylinders should be immediately unloaded from the vehicle . 
 All loads above the threshold must comply with the full requirements of ADR . 
 = = = = USA = = = = 
 Transportation of hazardous materials for commercial purposes in the USA is regulated by Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 - Transportation , ( abbreviated 49 CFR ) . A cylinder containing 200 kPa ( 29 @.@ 0 <unk> / 43 @.@ 8 <unk> ) or greater at 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) of non @-@ flammable , <unk> compressed gas , and being transported for commercial purposes is classified as HAZMAT ( hazardous materials ) in terms of 49 CFR 173 @.@ 115 ( b ) ( 1 ) . Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits ( exemptions ) issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations . Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit , and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar ( 4400 psi ) by several manufacturers . 
 Surface transport 
 Commercial transportation of breathing gas cylinders with a combined weight of more than 1000 pounds may only be done by a commercial HAZMAT transportation company . Transport of cylinders with a combined weight of less than 1000 pounds requires a manifest , the cylinders must have been tested and inspected to federal standards , and the contents marked on each cylinder . Transportation must be done in a safe manner , with the cylinders restrained from movement . No special licence is required . DOT regulations require content labels for all cylinders under the regulations , but according to PSI , labelling of breathing air will not be enforced . Oxygen or non @-@ air oxidizing ( 23 @.@ 5 + % O2 ) mixtures must be labelled . Private ( non @-@ commercial ) transport of scuba cylinders is not covered by this regulation . 
 Air transport 
 Empty scuba tanks or scuba tanks pressurized at less than 200 kPa are not restricted as hazardous materials . Scuba cylinders are only allowed in checked baggage or as a carry @-@ on if the cylinder valve is completely disconnected from the cylinder and the cylinder has an open end to allow for a visual inspection inside .

 = = = Worldwide = = = 
 The colours permitted for diving cylinders vary considerably by region , and to some extent by the gas mixture contained . 
 In some parts of the world there is no legislation controlling the colour of diving cylinders . In other regions the colour of cylinders used for commercial diving , or for all underwater diving may be specified by national standards . 
 In many recreational diving settings where air and nitrox are the widely used gases , nitrox cylinders are identified with a green stripe on yellow background . Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver . Steel diving cylinders are usually painted , to reduce corrosion , often yellow or white to increase visibility . In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables , yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and / or corrosive contents ; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible . 
 Cylinders that are used for partial pressure gas blending with pure oxygen may also be required to display an " oxygen service certificate " label indicating they have been prepared for use with high partial pressures and gas fractions of oxygen . 
 = = = European Union = = = 
 In the European Union gas cylinders may be colour @-@ coded according to EN 1098 @-@ 3 . In the UK this standard is optional . The " shoulder " is the domed top of the cylinder between the parallel section and the pillar valve . For mixed gases , the colours can be either bands or " quarters " . 
 Air has either a white ( RAL 9010 ) top and black ( RAL 9005 ) band on the shoulder , or white ( RAL 9010 ) and black ( RAL 9005 ) " quartered " shoulders . 
 Heliox has either a white ( RAL 9010 ) top and brown ( RAL 8008 ) band on the shoulder , or white ( RAL 9010 ) and brown ( RAL 8008 ) " quartered " shoulders .

 = Nevill Ground = 
 The Nevill Ground is a cricket venue located in Royal Tunbridge Wells , Kent , England . It is owned by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council and is used by Tunbridge Wells CC as well as annually for Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week by Kent County Cricket Club . It was opened in 1898 and was first used by Kent in 1901 and has been used by them annually since then , despite a suffragette arson attack that destroyed the pavilion in 1913 . 
 It played host to one One Day International during the 1983 Cricket World Cup , the group stage match between India and Zimbabwe in which Kapil Dev made a score of 175 not out . The Nevill Ground is known for having rhododendron bushes around the perimeter . 
 = = History = = 
 The Nevill Ground was established in 1895 after the purchase of the land by the Tunbridge Wells Cricket , Football and Athletic Club , with assistance from the Bluemantle Cricket Club . It was purchased on a 99 @-@ year lease from the Marquess of Abergavenny as the land was part of his Eridge Park estate . The Nevill Ground was named after William Nevill , 1st Marquess of Abergavenny . Building of the ground 's facilities started in 1896 with it being officially opened by the Marquess of Abergavenny in 1898 . In the early 20th century , the county boundary between Kent and East Sussex ran through the Nevill Ground 's pitch . Rhododendron bushes were also planted in the Nevill Ground 's early history . The rhododendrons around the pitch are considered by cricket commentators as one of the defining images of the Nevill Ground . The end opposite the pavilion is known as the Railway End due to the Hastings Line running close by that end of the ground . 
 The first pavilion was designed by architect C. H. Strange . It was built in 1903 at a cost of £ 1 @,@ 200 and was destroyed in a suffragette arson attack in April 1913 . During the First World War , the Nevill Ground was requisitioned by the British army to graze cavalry horses . This damaged the pitch and it took a few years for it to recover . During the Second World War , the Nevill Ground was again requisitioned for military purposes , this time to hold soldiers . In 1946 , ownership of the ground was transferred from the Tunbridge Wells Cricket , Football and Athletic Club to Tunbridge Wells Borough Council . 
 In 1995 , a permanent brick stand was built and became known as the Bluemantle Stand after the Bluemantle Cricket Club members who helped to build it . The Bluemantle Stand was built on the site of the original pavilion . Every Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week , Tunbridge Wells Borough Council erects a temporary grandstand at the Nevill Ground . 
 = = = 1913 arson = = = 
 On 11 April 1913 , the cricket pavilion was burnt down by militant suffragettes due to Kent having a policy of no @-@ admittance to women . The fire was started in the dressing rooms with the perpetrator setting fire to cricket nets that were being stored in there . The fire was discovered by a passing <unk> . The fire brigade extinguished the fire in an hour , too late to save the pavilion . In front of the remains of the pavilion , firemen found suffragette literature , an electric lantern and a picture of Emmeline Pankhurst . The fire also destroyed photographs of the first Canterbury Cricket Week and the Bluemantle Cricket Club 's archives . The attack may have been provoked by a comment from an unknown Kent official who is reported to have said " It is not true that women are banned from the pavilion . Who do you think makes the teas ? " 
 There was an angry reaction to the attack locally and nationally . The National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage held a meeting in the town with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle attending , where he called the suffragettes " female hooligans " and compared the attack to " blowing up a blind man and his dog " . A new pavilion was built using the original designs after a series of fund raising concerts at the Opera House at a cost of £ 1 @,@ 200 . Construction was finished in 9 weeks , being completed hours before Kent were due to play at the Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week in July 1913 . Nevill Ground was the only cricket ground to be attacked by suffragettes .

 The Nevill Ground is used regularly by Kent Cricket League team , Tunbridge Wells CC . It is also used to host field hockey and is used by Tunbridge Wells Hockey Club . It was formerly used to host association football however the Nevill Ground stopped hosting football in 1903 . It is also home to the town 's athletics club Tunbridge Wells Harriers . Kent County Cricket Club use the ground as one of its outgrounds for two or three County Matches a year . Two first @-@ class matches were played every year until 1992 , when the number was reduced to one . However , since the demise of Mote Park in Maidstone , Tunbridge Wells regained an extra fixture . 
 The Nevill Ground was first used as an <unk> by Kent in 1901 at the behest of George Harris , 4th Baron Harris . In order to assist Kent , Tunbridge Wells Borough Council contribute £ 25 @,@ 000 to cover the running costs of hosting Kent 's games at the Nevill Ground . The Nevill Ground was popular with Kent 's players due to its surroundings and it was described by cricket historian , E. W. Swanton as " no mean contender for the most delectable English cricket ground . " 
 In 2012 , Kent 's Friends Life Twenty20 match against Sussex was moved to the St Lawrence Ground after the Nevill Ground was flooded after heavy rainfall leading to the 100th Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week being cut short .

Dev 's partnership with Syed Kirmani set a world record for the largest ninth wicket stand of 126 . This match led to the Nevill Ground being held in high regard by Indian cricket fans with there being a view that the game at the Nevill Ground inspired a change in the way cricket was played in India . This led to players such as Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid playing for India in later years . 
 There was no official footage taken of the match since the BBC was on strike on the day of the match , the Nevill Ground being ruled as too small with India and Zimbabwe being deemed too " irrelevant " for a camera crew to be sent to the match . Despite this there were reports of an Indian who filmed unofficial coverage of the match with a camcorder . The tape was purchased by Dev after the match for an unknown amount . However , it has been claimed that this is an urban legend and that there was no proof of this occurring . 
 In 2008 , to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the game , Dev returned to the Nevill Ground to film a news segment . Afterwards he was welcomed by representatives of Kent County Cricket Club and Tunbridge Wells Borough Council .

 = Tadeusz Kościuszko = 
 Andrzej Tadeusz Bonawentura Kościuszko ( Andrew Thaddeus Bonaventure Kościuszko ; February 4 or 12 , 1746 – October 15 , 1817 ) was a Polish – Lithuanian military engineer and a military leader who became a national hero in Poland , Lithuania , Belarus , and the United States . He fought in the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth 's struggles against Russia and Prussia , and on the American side in the American Revolutionary War . As Supreme Commander of the Polish National Armed Forces , he led the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising . 
 Kościuszko was born in February 1746 in the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , in a village that is now in Belarus ; his exact birthdate is unknown . At age 20 , he graduated from the Corps of Cadets in Warsaw , Poland , but after the outbreak of a civil war involving the Bar Confederation in 1768 , Kościuszko moved to France in 1769 to pursue further studies . He returned to Poland in 1774 , two years after its First Partition , and took a position as tutor in Józef Sylwester Sosnowski 's household . After Kościuszko attempted to elope with his employer 's daughter and was severely beaten by the father 's retainers , he returned to France . In 1776 , Kościuszko moved to North America , where he took part in the American Revolutionary War as a colonel in the Continental Army . An accomplished military architect , he designed and oversaw the construction of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art fortifications , including those at West Point , New York . In 1783 , in recognition of his services , the Continental Congress promoted him to brigadier general . 
 Returning to Poland in 1784 , Kościuszko was commissioned a major general in the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth Army in 1789 . After the Polish – Russian War of 1792 had resulted in the Second Partition of Poland , he organized an uprising against Russia in March 1794 , serving as its Naczelnik ( commander @-@ in @-@ chief ) . Russian forces captured him at the Battle of Maciejowice in October 1794 . The defeat of the Kościuszko Uprising that November led to Poland 's Third Partition in 1795 , which ended the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth 's independent existence for 123 years . In 1796 , following the death of Tsaritsa Catherine the Great , Kościuszko was pardoned by her successor , Tsar Paul I , and he emigrated to the United States . A close friend of Thomas Jefferson , with whom he shared ideals of human rights , Kościuszko wrote a will in 1798 dedicating his American assets to the education and freedom of U.S. slaves . He eventually returned to Europe and lived in Switzerland until his death in 1817 . The execution of his will later proved difficult and the funds were never used for the purpose he had intended . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Kościuszko was born in February 1746 in the village of <unk> ( since 1945 <unk> , Belarus ) , a folwark near the town of <unk> <unk> ( since 1945 <unk> , Belarus ) . His exact birthdate is unknown ; commonly cited are February 4 and February 12 . The area lay within the Polesie region , then in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , a part of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . 
 Kościuszko was the youngest son of a member of the szlachta ( nobility ) , Ludwik Tadeusz Kościuszko , an officer in the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth Army , and his wife <unk> , née <unk> . The <unk> held the Polish Roch III coat of arms . At the time of Tadeusz Kościuszko 's birth , the family possessed modest landholdings in the Grand Duchy , which were worked by 31 peasant families . 
 Tadeusz was baptized by the Roman Catholic church and the Orthodox Church , thereby receiving the names Andrzej , Tadeusz , and Bonawentura . His paternal family was ethnically Lithuanian – Ruthenian and traced their ancestry to Konstanty <unk> <unk> , a courtier of Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I the Old . Kościuszko 's maternal family , the <unk> , were also Ruthenian . 
 Modern Belarusian writers interpret his Ruthenian or Lithuanian heritage as Belarusian . He once described himself as a <unk> , a term that denoted inhabitants , of whatever ethnicity , of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , within the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . Modern Belarusian writers interpret <unk> as designating a Belarusian , before the word " Belarusian " had come into use . Kościuszko , however , did not speak the Belarusian language ; his family had become Polonized as early as the 16th century . Like most Polish – Lithuanian nobility of the time , the <unk> spoke Polish and identified with Polish culture . 
 In 1755 , Kościuszko began attending school in <unk> , but never finished due to his family 's financial straits after his father 's death in 1758 . Poland 's King Stanisław August Poniatowski established a Corps of Cadets ( <unk> <unk> ) in 1765 , at what is now Warsaw University , to educate military officers and government officials . Kościuszko enrolled in the Corps on December 18 , 1765 , likely thanks to the patronage of the Czartoryski family . The school emphasized military subjects and the liberal arts , and after graduating on December 20 , 1766 , Kościuszko was promoted to chorąży ( a military rank roughly equivalent to modern lieutenant ) ; he stayed on as a student instructor and by 1768 had attained the rank of captain . 
 = = = European travels = = = 
 In 1768 , civil war broke out in the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , when the Bar Confederation sought to depose King Stanisław August Poniatowski . One of Kościuszko 's brothers , Józef , fought on the side of the insurgents . Faced with a difficult choice between the rebels and his sponsors — the King and the Czartoryski family , who favored a gradualist approach to shedding Russian domination — Kościuszko chose to leave Poland . In late 1769 , he and a colleague , the noted artist Aleksander <unk> , were granted royal scholarships , and on October 5 they set off for Paris . They wanted to further their military education , but as foreigners they were barred from enrolling in French military academies , and so they enrolled instead in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture . There Kościuszko pursued his interest in drawing and painting and took private lessons in architecture from the noted French architect Jean @-@ Rodolphe <unk> . 
 Kościuszko , however , did not give up on improving his military knowledge . He audited lectures for five years and frequented the libraries of the Paris military academies . His exposure to the French Enlightenment , along with the religious tolerance practiced in the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , strongly influenced his later career . The French economic theory of physiocracy made a particularly strong impression on his thinking . He also developed his artistic skills , and while his career would take him in a different direction , all his life he continued drawing and painting . 
 In the First Partition of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772 , Russia , Prussia and Austria annexed large swaths of Polish – Lithuanian territory and gained influence over the internal politics of the reduced Polish and Lithuanian states . When Kościuszko finally returned home in 1774 , he found that his brother Józef had squandered most of the family fortune , and there was no place for him in the Army , as he could not afford to buy an officer 's commission . He took a position as tutor to the family of the magnate , province governor ( voivode ) and hetman Józef Sylwester Sosnowski and fell in love with the governor 's daughter Ludwika . Their elopement was thwarted by her father 's retainers . Kościuszko received a thrashing at their hands , an event that may have led to his later antipathy to class distinctions . In the autumn of 1775 , he decided to emigrate to avoid Sosnowski and his retainers . In late 1775 , he attempted to join the Saxon army but was turned down and decided to return to Paris . There he learned of the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War , in which the British colonies in North America had revolted against the crown and begun their struggle for independence . The first American successes were well @-@ publicized in France , and the French people and government openly supported the revolutionaries ' cause . 
 = = American Revolutionary War = = 
 On learning of the American Revolution , Kościuszko , himself a man of revolutionary aspirations , sympathetic to the American cause and an advocate of human rights , sailed for America in June 1776 along with other foreign officers , likely with the help of a French supporter of the American revolutionaries , Pierre Beaumarchais . On August 30 , 1776 , Kościuszko submitted an application to the Second Continental Congress ; he was assigned to the Continental Army the next day . 
 = = = Northern region = = = 
 Kościuszko 's first task was building fortifications at Fort <unk> in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , to protect the banks of the Delaware River and prevent a possible British advance up the river to Philadelphia . He initially served as a volunteer in the employ of Benjamin Franklin , but on October 18 , 1776 , Congress commissioned him a colonel of engineers in the Continental Army . 
 In spring 1777 , Kościuszko was attached to the Northern Army under Major General Horatio Gates , arriving at the Canadian border in May 1777 . Subsequently posted to Fort Ticonderoga , he reviewed the defenses of what had been one of the most formidable fortresses in North America . His surveys prompted him to strongly recommend the construction of a battery on Sugar Loaf , a high point overlooking the fort . His prudent recommendation , in which his fellow engineers concurred , was turned down by the garrison commander , Brigadier General Arthur St. Clair . 
 This proved a tactical blunder : when a British army under General John Burgoyne arrived in July 1777 , Burgoyne did exactly what Kościuszko had warned of and had his engineers place artillery on the hill . With the British in complete control of the high ground , the Americans realized their situation was hopeless and abandoned the fortress with hardly a shot fired in the Siege of Ticonderoga . The British advance force nipped hard on the heels of the outnumbered and exhausted Continentals as they fled south . Major General Philip Schuyler , desperate to put distance between his men and their pursuers , ordered Kościuszko to delay the enemy . Kościuszko designed an engineer 's solution : his men felled trees , dammed streams , and destroyed bridges and causeways . <unk> by their huge supply train , the British began to bog down , giving the Americans the time needed to safely withdraw across the Hudson River . 
 Gates tapped Kościuszko to survey the country between the opposing armies , choose the most defensible position , and fortify it . Finding just such a position near Saratoga , overlooking the Hudson at Bemis Heights , Kościuszko laid out a strong array of defenses , nearly impregnable from any direction . His judgment and meticulous attention to detail frustrated the British attacks during the Battle of Saratoga , and Gates accepted the surrender of Burgoyne 's force there on October 16 , 1777 . The dwindling British army had been dealt a sound defeat , turning the tide to an American advantage . Kościuszko 's work at Saratoga received great praise from Gates , who later told his friend Dr. Benjamin Rush : " [ T ] he great tacticians of the campaign were hills and forests , which a young Polish engineer was skillful enough to select for my encampment . " 
 At some point in 1777 , Kościuszko composed a polonaise and scored it for the harpsichord . Named for him , and with lyrics by <unk> <unk> , it later became popular with Polish patriots during the November 1830 Uprising . Around that time , Kościuszko was assigned a black orderly , Agrippa Hull , whom he would treat as an equal and a friend . 
 In March 1778 Kościuszko arrived at West Point , New York , and spent more than two years strengthening the fortifications and improving the stronghold 's defenses . It was these defenses that the American General Benedict Arnold subsequently attempted to surrender to the British when he became a traitor . Soon after Kościuszko had finished fortifying West Point , in August 1780 , General George Washington granted Kościuszko 's request to transfer to combat duty with the Southern Army . Kościuszko 's West Point fortifications would be widely praised as innovative for the time . 
 = = = Southern region = = = 
 After traveling south through rural Virginia in October 1780 , Kościuszko proceeded to North Carolina to report to his former commander General Gates . However , following Gates ' disastrous defeat at Camden on August 16 , 1780 , the Continental Congress had selected Washington 's choice , Major General Nathanael Greene , to replace the disgraced Gates as commander of the Southern Department . When Greene formally assumed command on December 3 , 1780 , he retained Kościuszko as his chief engineer . By then , he had been praised by both Gates and Greene . 
 Over the course of this campaign , Kościuszko was placed in command of building bateaux , siting the location for camps , scouting river crossings , fortifying positions , and developing intelligence contacts . Many of his contributions were instrumental in preventing the destruction of the Southern Army . This was especially so during the famous " Race to the Dan " , when British General Charles Cornwallis chased Greene across 200 miles ( 320 km ) of rough back country in January and February 1781 . Thanks largely to a combination of Greene 's tactics , and Kościuszko 's bateaux , and accurate scouting of the rivers ahead of the main body , the Continentals safely crossed each river , including the Yadkin and the Dan . Cornwallis , having no boats , and finding no way to cross the swollen Dan , finally gave up the chase and withdrew back into North Carolina . The Continentals regrouped south of Halifax , Virginia , where Kościuszko had earlier , at Greene 's request , established a fortified depot . 
 During the Race to the Dan , Kościuszko had helped select the site where Greene eventually returned to fight Cornwallis at Guilford Courthouse . Though tactically defeated , the Americans all but destroyed Cornwallis ' army as an effective fighting force and gained a permanent strategic advantage in the South . Thus , when Greene began his reconquest of South Carolina in the spring of 1781 , he summoned Kościuszko to rejoin the main body of the Southern Army . The combined forces of the Continentals and Southern militia gradually forced the British from the back country into the coastal ports during the latter half of 1781 and , on August 16 , Kościuszko participated in the Second Battle of Camden . At Ninety Six , Kościuszko besieged the Star Fort from May 22 to June 18 . During the unsuccessful siege , he suffered his only wound in seven years of service , bayonetted in the buttocks during an assault by the fort 's defenders on the approach trench that he was constructing . 
 Kościuszko subsequently helped fortify the American bases in North Carolina , before taking part in several smaller operations in the final year of hostilities , harassing British foraging parties near Charleston , South Carolina . He had become engaged in these operations after the death of his friend Colonel John Laurens , taking over Laurens ' intelligence network in the area . He commanded two cavalry squadrons and an infantry unit , and his last known battlefield command of the war occurred at James Island , South Carolina , on November 14 , 1782 . In what has been described as the Continental Army 's final armed action of the war , he was very nearly killed as his small force was routed . A month later , he was among the Continental troops that reoccupied Charleston following the British evacuation of the city . Kościuszko spent the rest of the war there , conducting a fireworks display on April 23 , 1783 , to celebrate the signing of the Treaty of Paris earlier that month . 
 = = = Mustering @-@ out = = = 
 Having not been paid in his seven years of service , in late May 1783 , Kościuszko decided to collect the salary owed to him . That year , he was asked by Congress to supervise the fireworks during the July 4 celebrations at Princeton , New Jersey . On October 13 , 1783 , Congress promoted him to brigadier general , but he still had not received his back pay ; many other officers and soldiers were in the same situation . While waiting for his pay , unable even to finance a voyage back to Europe , Kościuszko , like a number of others , lived on money borrowed from the Polish @-@ Jewish banker Haym Solomon . Eventually , he would receive a certificate for 12 @,@ 280 dollars , at 6 % , to be paid on January 1 , 1784 , and the right to 500 acres ( 202 @.@ 34 ha ; 0 @.@ 78 sq mi ) of land , but only if he chose to settle in the United States . For the winter of 1783 – 84 , his former commanding officer , General Greene , invited Kościuszko to stay at his mansion . He was also inducted into the Society of the Cincinnati . 
 = = Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth = = 
 On July 15 , 1784 , Kościuszko set off for Poland , where he arrived on August 26 . Due to a conflict between his patrons , the Czartoryski family , and King Stanisław August Poniatowski , Kościuszko once again failed to get a commission in the Commonwealth Army . He settled in <unk> ( Belarusian : <unk> , now <unk> , Belarus ) . His brother Józef had lost most of the family 's lands through bad investments , but with the help of his sister Anna , Kościuszko secured part of the lands for himself . He decided to limit his male peasants ' corvée ( obligatory service to the lord of the manor ) to two days a week , and completely exempted the female peasants . His estate soon stopped being profitable , and he began going into debt . The situation was not helped by failure of the money promised by the American government — interest on late payment for his seven years ' military service — to materialize . Kościuszko struck up friendships with liberal activists ; Hugo Kołłątaj offered him a position as lecturer at Kraków 's Jagiellonian University , which Kościuszko declined . 
 Finally the Great Sejm of 1788 – 92 introduced some reforms , including a planned build @-@ up of the army to defend the Commonwealth 's borders . Kościuszko saw a chance to return to military service and spent some time in Warsaw , among those who engaged in the political debates outside the Great Sejm . He wrote a proposal to create a militia force , on the American model . As political pressure grew to build up the army , and Kościuszko 's political allies gained influence with the King , Kościuszko again applied for a commission , and on October 12 , 1789 , received a royal commission as a major general . He began receiving the high salary of 12 @,@ 000 złoty a year , ending his financial difficulties . He asked for a transfer to the Lithuanian army but was instead assigned to a unit in the west , in Greater Poland . On February 1 , 1790 , he reported for duty in Włocławek , and in mid @-@ March he was given a command . Around summer , he commanded some infantry and cavalry units in the region between the Bug and Vistula Rivers . In August 1790 he was posted to Volhynia , stationed near Starokostiantyniv and <unk> . Prince Józef Poniatowski , who happened to be the King 's nephew , recognized Kościuszko 's superior experience and made him his second @-@ in @-@ command , leaving him in command when he was absent . 
 Meanwhile , Kościuszko became more closely involved with the political reformers , befriending Hugo Kołłątaj , Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and others . Kościuszko argued that the peasants and Jews should receive full citizenship status , as this would motivate them to help defend Poland in the event of war . The political reformers centered in the Patriotic Party scored a major victory with the adoption of the Constitution of May 3 , 1791 . Kościuszko saw the Constitution as a step in the right direction , but was disappointed that it retained the monarchy and did little to improve the situation of the most underprivileged , the peasants and the Jews . The Commonwealth 's neighbors saw the Constitution 's reforms as a threat to their influence over Polish internal affairs . A year after the Constitution 's adoption , on May 14 , 1792 , reactionary magnates formed the Targowica Confederation , which asked Russia 's Tsaritsa Catherine II for help in overthrowing the Constitution . Four days later , on May 18 , 1792 , a 100 @,@ 000 @-@ man Russian army crossed the Polish border , headed for Warsaw , beginning the Polish – Russian War of 1792 . 
 = = = Defense of the Constitution = = = 
 The Russians had a 3 : 1 advantage in strength , with some 98 @,@ 000 troops against 37 @,@ 000 Poles ; they also had an advantage in combat experience . Before the Russians invaded , Kościuszko had been appointed deputy commander of Prince Józef Poniatowski 's infantry division , stationed in Polish West Ukraine . When the Prince became Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the entire Polish ( Crown ) Army on May 3 , 1792 , Kościuszko was given command of a division near Kiev . 
 The Russians attacked on a wide front with three armies . Kościuszko proposed that the entire Polish army be concentrated and engage one of the Russian armies , in order to assure numerical parity and boost the morale of the mostly inexperienced Polish forces with a quick victory ; but Poniatowski rejected this plan . On May 22 , 1792 , the Russian forces crossed the border in Ukraine , where Kościuszko and Poniatowski were stationed . The Crown Army was judged too weak to oppose the four enemy columns advancing into West Ukraine , and began a fighting withdrawal to the western side of the Southern Bug River , with Kościuszko commanding the rear guard . On June 18 , Poniatowski won the Battle of Zieleńce ; Kościuszko 's division , on detached rear @-@ guard duty , did not take part in the battle and rejoined the main army only at nightfall ; nonetheless , his diligent protection of the main army 's rear and flanks won him the newly created Virtuti Militari , to this day Poland 's highest military decoration . ( <unk> , however , states that Kościuszko received the Virtuti Militari for his later , July 18 victory at Dubienka . ) The Polish withdrawal continued , and on July 7 Kościuszko 's forces fought a delaying battle against the Russians at Volodymyr @-@ Volynskyi ( the Battle of Włodzimierz ) . On reaching the northern Bug River , the Polish Army was split into three divisions to hold the river defensive line — weakening the Poles ' point numerical superiority , against Kościuszko 's counsel of a single strong , concentrated army . 
 Kościuszko 's force was assigned to protect the front 's southern flank , touching up to the Austrian border . At the Battle of Dubienka ( July 18 , 1792 ) Kościuszko repulsed a numerically superior enemy , skilfully using terrain obstacles and field fortifications , and came to be regarded as one of Poland 's most brilliant military commanders of the age . With some 5 @,@ 300 men , he defeated 25 @,@ 000 Russians led by General Michail <unk> . Despite the tactical victory , Kościuszko had to retreat from Dubienka , as the Russians crossed the nearby Austrian border and began flanking his positions . 
 After the battle , King Stanisław August Poniatowski promoted Kościuszko to lieutenant @-@ general and awarded him the Order of the White Eagle . News of Kościuszko 's victory spread over Europe , and on August 26 he received the honorary citizenship of France from the Legislative Assembly of revolutionary France . While Kościuszko considered the war 's outcome to still be unsettled , the King requested a ceasefire . On July 24 , 1792 , before Kościuszko had received his promotion to lieutenant @-@ general , the King shocked the army by announcing his accession to the Targowica Confederation and ordering the Polish – Lithuanian armies to cease hostilities against the Russians . Kościuszko considered abducting the King as the Bar Confederates had done two decades earlier , in 1771 , but was dissuaded by Prince Józef Poniatowski . On August 30 Kościuszko resigned his army position and briefly returned to Warsaw , where he received his promotion and pay , but refused the King 's request that he remain in the Army . Around that time , he also fell ill with jaundice . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 The King 's capitulation was a hard blow for Kościuszko , who had not lost a single battle in the campaign . By mid @-@ September 1792 he was resigned to leaving the country , and in early October he departed from Warsaw . First he went east , to the Czartoryski family manor at <unk> , which gathered various malcontents . In mid @-@ November he spent two weeks in Lwów ( in Ukrainian , Lviv ; in German , Lemberg ) , where he was welcomed by the populace ; since the war 's end , his presence had drawn crowds eager to see the famed commander . Izabela Czartoryska discussed having him marry her daughter Zofia . The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control ; the Austrians , who held Lwów , offered him a commission in the Austrian Army , which he turned down . Subsequently they planned to deport him , but he left Lwów before they could do so . At the turn of the month , he stopped in Zamość at the <unk> ' estate , met Stanisław Staszic , then went on to Puławy . 
 He did not tarry long there either : on December 12 – 13 , he was in Kraków ; on December 17 , in Wrocław ; and shortly after , he settled in Leipzig , where many notable Polish soldiers and politicians formed an émigré community . Soon he and some others began plotting an uprising against Russian rule in Poland . The politicians , grouped around Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj , sought contacts with similar opposition groups in Poland and by spring 1793 had been joined by other politicians and revolutionaries , including Ignacy <unk> . While Kołłątaj and others had begun planning an uprising before Kościuszko joined them , his support was a major boon to them , as he was among the most popular individuals in Poland . 
 After two weeks in Leipzig , before the second week of January 1793 , Kościuszko set off for Paris , where he tried to gain French support for the planned uprising in Poland . He stayed there until summer , but despite the growing revolutionary influence there , the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause , and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete . Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause , and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution — the infighting among different factions , and the growing reign of terror . 
 On January 23 , 1793 , Prussia and Russia signed the Second Partition of Poland . The Grodno Sejm , convened under duress in June , ratified the partition and was also forced to rescind the Constitution of May 3 , 1791 . With the second partition , Poland became a small country of roughly 200 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 77 @,@ 000 sq mi ) and a population of some 4 million . This came as a shock to the Targowica Confederates , who had seen themselves as defenders of centuries @-@ old privileges of the magnates , but had hardly expected that their appeal for help to the Tsarina of Russia would further reduce and weaken their country . 
 In August 1793 , Kościuszko , though worried that an uprising would have little chance against the three partitioning powers , returned to Leipzig , where he was met with demands to start planning one as soon as possible . In September he clandestinely crossed the Polish border to conduct personal observations and meet with sympathetic high @-@ ranking officers in the residual Polish Army , including General Józef <unk> . The preparations went slowly , and he left for Italy , planning to return in February 1794 . However , the situation in Poland was changing rapidly . The Russian and Prussian governments forced Poland to again disband most of her army , and the reduced units were to be incorporated into the Russian Army . In March , Tsarist agents discovered the revolutionaries in Warsaw and began arresting notable Polish politicians and military commanders . Kościuszko was forced to execute his plan earlier than he had intended and , on March 15 , 1794 , set off for Kraków . 
 = = Kościuszko Uprising = = 
 Learning that the Russian garrison had departed Kraków , Kościuszko entered the city on the night of March 23 , 1794 . The next morning , in the Main Square , he announced an uprising . Kościuszko received the title of Naczelnik ( commander @-@ in @-@ chief ) of Polish – Lithuanian forces fighting against the Russian occupation . He proceeded to mobilize the populace , intending to raise sufficient numbers of volunteers to counteract the larger and more professional Russian Army . He also hoped that neither Austria nor Prussia would intervene , and so discouraged insurgent activity in the Austrian and Prussian Partitions . 
 Kościuszko gathered an army of some 6 @,@ 000 , including 4 @,@ 000 regular soldiers and 2 @,@ 000 recruits , and marched on Warsaw . The Russians succeeded in organizing an army to oppose him more quickly than he had expected , but he scored a victory at Racławice on April 4 , 1794 , where he turned the tide by personally leading an infantry charge of peasant volunteers ( <unk> , <unk> ) . Nonetheless , this Russian defeat was not strategically significant , and the Russian forces quickly forced Kościuszko to retreat toward Kraków . Near Połaniec he received reinforcements and met with other Uprising leaders ( Kołłątaj , Potocki ) ; at Połaniec he issued a major political declaration of the Uprising , the Proclamation of Połaniec . The declaration stated that serfs were entitled to civil rights and reduced their work obligations ( corvée ) . Meanwhile , the Russians set a bounty for Kościuszko 's capture , " dead or alive " . 
 By June , the Prussians had begun actively aiding the Russians , and on June 6 , 1794 , Kościuszko fought a defensive battle against a Prussian @-@ Russian force at <unk> . From late June , for several weeks , he defended Warsaw , controlled by the insurgents . On June 28 , a mob of insurgents in Warsaw captured and hanged Bishop Ignacy Massalski and six others . Kościuszko issued a public reproach , writing , " What happened in Warsaw yesterday filled my heart with bitterness and sorrow " , and urging , successfully , that rule of law be followed . By the morning of September 6 , the Prussian forces having been withdrawn to suppress an uprising underway in Greater Poland , the siege of Warsaw was lifted . On October 10 , during a sortie against a new Russian attack , Kościuszko was wounded and captured at Maciejowice . He was imprisoned by the Russians at Saint Petersburg in the Peter and Paul Fortress . Soon afterward , the uprising ended with the Battle of Praga , where according to a contemporary Russian witness , the Russians troops massacred 20 @,@ 000 Warsaw residents . The subsequent Third Partition of Poland ended the existence of a sovereign Polish state for the next 123 years . 
 = = Later life = = 
 The death of Tsaritsa Catherine the Great on November 17 , 1796 , led to a change in Russia 's policies toward Poland . On November 28 , Tsar Paul I , who had hated Catherine , pardoned Kościuszko and set him free , after he had tendered an oath of loyalty . Paul promised to free all Polish political prisoners held in Russian prisons and forcibly settled in Siberia . The Tsar gave Kościuszko 12 @,@ 000 rubles , which the Pole later , in 1798 , attempted to return , when also renouncing the oath . 
 Kościuszko left for the United States , via Stockholm , Sweden and London , departing from Bristol on June 17 , 1797 , and arriving in Philadelphia on August 18 . Though welcomed by the populace , he was viewed with suspicion by the American government , controlled by the Federalists , who distrusted Kościuszko for his previous association with the Democratic @-@ Republican Party . 
 In March 1798 , Kościuszko received a bundle of letters from Europe . The news in one of them came as a shock to him , causing him , still in his wounded condition , to spring from his couch and limp unassisted to the middle of the room and exclaim to General Anthony Walton White , " I must return at once to Europe ! " The letter in question contained news that Polish General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski and Polish soldiers were fighting in France under Napoleon and that Kościuszko 's sister had sent his two nephews in Kościuszko 's name to serve in Napoleon 's ranks . Around that time Kościuszko also received news that Talleyrand was seeking Kościuszko 's moral and public endorsement for the French fight against one of Poland 's partitioners , Prussia . The call of family and country drew Kościuszko back to Europe . He immediately consulted Thomas Jefferson , who procured him a passport under a false name and arranged for his secret departure for France . Kościuszko left no word for either his former comrade @-@ in @-@ arms and fellow St. Petersburg prisoner Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz or for his own servant , only leaving some money for them . 
 Other factors contributed to his decision to depart . His French connections meant that he was vulnerable to deportation or imprisonment under the terms of the Alien and Sedition Acts . Jefferson was concerned that the U.S. and France were verging on the brink of war after the XYZ Affair and regarded him as an informal envoy . Kościuszko later wrote , " Jefferson considered that I would be the most effective intermediary in bringing an accord with France , so I accepted the mission even if without any official authorization . " 
 = = = Disposition of American estate = = = 
 Before Kościuszko left for France , he collected his back pay , wrote a will , and entrusted it to Jefferson as executor . Kościuszko and Jefferson had become firm friends by 1797 and thereafter corresponded for twenty years in a spirit of mutual admiration . Jefferson wrote that " He is as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known . " In the will , Kościuszko left his American estate to be sold to buy the freedom of black slaves , including Jefferson 's own , and to educate them for independent life and work . Several years after Kościuszko 's death , Jefferson , aged 77 , pleaded inability to act as executor due to age and the numerous legal complexities of the bequest , which was tied up in the courts until 1856 . Jefferson recommended his friend John Hartwell Cocke , who also opposed slavery , as executor , but Cocke likewise declined to execute the bequest . The case of Kościuszko 's American estate went three times to the U.S. Supreme Court . He had made four wills , three of which postdated the American one . None of the money that Kościuszko had earmarked for the manumission and education of African Americans in the United States was ever used for that purpose . Though the American will was never carried out , its legacy went to found an educational institute for African Americans in the United States — at Newark , New Jersey , in 1826 , bearing Kościuszko 's name . 
 = = = Return to Europe = = = 
 Kościuszko arrived in Bayonne , France , on June 28 , 1798 . By that time , Talleyrand 's plans had changed and no longer included him . Kościuszko remained politically active in Polish émigré circles in France , and on August 7 , 1799 , he joined the Society of Polish Republicans ( Towarzystwo <unk> Polskich ) . Kościuszko , however , refused the offered command of Polish Legions being formed for service with France . On October 17 and November 6 , 1799 , he met with Napoleon Bonaparte ; however , he failed to reach an agreement with the French general , who regarded Kościuszko a " fool " who " overestimated his influence " in Poland . Kościuszko , for his part , disliked Napoleon for his dictatorial aspirations and called him the " undertaker of the [ French ] Republic " . In 1801 , Kościuszko settled in Breville , near Paris , distancing himself from politics . 
 Kościuszko did not believe that Napoleon would restore Poland in any durable form . When Napoleon 's forces approached the borders of Poland , Kościuszko wrote him a letter , demanding guarantees of parliamentary democracy and substantial national borders , which Napoleon ignored . Kościuszko concluded that Napoleon had created the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807 only as an expedient , not because he supported Polish sovereignty . Consequently , Kościuszko did not move to the Duchy of Warsaw or join the new Army of the Duchy , allied with Napoleon . 
 Instead , after the fall of Napoleon , he met with Russia 's Tsar Alexander I , in Paris and then in Braunau , Switzerland . The Tsar hoped that Kościuszko could be convinced to return to Poland , where the Tsar planned to create a new , Russian @-@ allied Polish state ( the Congress Kingdom ) . In return for his prospective services , Kościuszko demanded social reforms and restoration of territory , which he wished would reach the Dvina and Dnieper Rivers in the east . However , soon afterwards , in Vienna , Kościuszko learned that the Kingdom of Poland to be created by the Tsar would be even smaller than the earlier Duchy of Warsaw . Kościuszko called such an entity " a joke " . When he received no reply to his letters to the Tsar , he left Vienna and moved to Solothurn , Switzerland . 
 On April 2 , 1817 , Kościuszko emancipated the peasants in his remaining lands in Poland , but Tsar Alexander disallowed this . Suffering from poor health and old wounds , on October 15 , 1817 , Kościuszko died in Solothurn at age 71 after falling from a horse , developing a fever , and suffering a stroke a few days later . 
 = = Funerals = = 
 Kościuszko 's first funeral was held on October 19 , 1817 , at a formerly Jesuit church in Solothurn . As news of his death spread , masses and memorial services were held in partitioned Poland . His embalmed body was deposited in a crypt of the Solothurn church . In 1818 , Kościuszko 's body was transferred to Kraków , arriving at St. Florian 's Church on April 11 , 1818 . On June 22 , 1818 , or June 23 , 1819 ( accounts vary ) , to the tolling of the Sigismund Bell and the firing of cannon , it was placed in a crypt at Wawel Cathedral , a pantheon of Polish kings and national heroes . 
 Kościuszko 's internal organs , which had been removed during embalming , were separately interred in a graveyard at <unk> , near Solothurn . Kościuszko 's organs remain there to this day ; a large memorial stone was erected in 1820 , next to a Polish memorial chapel . His heart , however , was not interred with the other organs , but instead kept in an urn at the Polish Museum in Rapperswil , Switzerland . The heart , along with the rest of the Museum 's holdings , were repatriated back to Warsaw in 1927 , where the heart now <unk> in a chapel at the Royal Castle . 
 = = Memorials and tributes = = 
 The Polish historian Stanisław Herbst states in the 1967 Polish Biographical Dictionary that Kościuszko may be Poland 's and the world 's most popular Pole ever . There are monuments to him around the world , beginning with the Kościuszko Mound at Kraków , erected in 1820 – 23 by men , women , and children bringing earth from the battlefields where he had fought . The Thaddeus Kosciusko Bridge , a twin bridge structure completed in 1959 which spans the Mohawk River in Albany , New York , and the Kosciuszko Bridge , built in 1939 in New York City , were named in Kosciuszko 's honor . 
 Kościuszko 's 1796 Philadelphia residence is now the Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial , America 's smallest national park or unit of the National Park System . There is a Kościuszko Museum at his last residence , in Solothurn , Switzerland . A Polish @-@ American cultural agency , the Kosciuszko Foundation , headquartered in New York City , was created in 1925 . 
 A series of Polish Air Force units have borne the name " Kościuszko Squadron " . During World War II a Polish Navy ship bore his name , as did the Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division . 
 One of the first examples of a historical novel , Thaddeus of Warsaw , was written in Kościuszko 's honor by the Scottish author Jane Porter ; it proved very popular , particularly in the United States , and went through over eighty editions in the 19th century . An opera , Kościuszko nad <unk> ( Kościuszko at the Seine ) , written in the early 1820s , featured music by Franciszek Salezy Dutkiewicz and libretto by Konstanty <unk> . Later works have included dramas by Apollo Korzeniowski , <unk> <unk> and Władysław Ludwik <unk> ; three novels by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski , one by Walery <unk> , one by Władysław Stanisław Reymont ; and works by Maria Konopnicka . 
 Kościuszko also appears in non @-@ Polish literature , including a sonnet by Samuel Taylor Coleridge , another by James Henry Leigh Hunt , poems by John Keats and Walter Savage Landor , and a work by Karl Eduard von <unk> . 
 In 1933 , the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp depicting an engraving of a statue of Kościuszko that stands in Washington , D.C. ' s Lafayette Square , near the White House . The stamp was issued on the 150th anniversary of Kościuszko 's naturalization as an American citizen . Poland has also issued several stamps in his honor . 
 There are statues of Kosciuszko in Poland at Kraków ( by Leonard Marconi ) , which was destroyed by German forces during the World War II occupation and was later replaced with a replica by Germany in 1960 and Łódź ( by Mieczysław <unk> ) ; in the United States at Boston , West Point , Philadelphia ( by Marian <unk> ) , Detroit ( a copy of Leonard Marconi 's Kraków statue ) , Washington , D.C. , Chicago , Milwaukee and Cleveland ; and in Switzerland at Solothurn . Kościuszko has been the subject of paintings by Richard Cosway , Franciszek Smuglewicz , Michał <unk> , Juliusz Kossak and Jan Matejko . A monumental Racławice Panorama was painted by Jan <unk> and Wojciech Kossak for the centenary of the 1794 Battle of Racławice . A commemorative monument was built in Minsk , Belarus in 2005 . 
 Geographic features that bear his name include Mount Kosciuszko , the tallest mountain in Australia . In the United States , places named after Kościuszko include Kosciusko Island in Alaska , Kosciusko County in Indiana , the city of Kosciusko in central Mississippi and numerous streets and parks . 
 Kościuszko has been the subject of many written works . The first biography of him was published in 1820 by Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz , who served beside Kosciuszko as his aide @-@ de @-@ camp and was also imprisoned in Russia after the uprising . English @-@ language biographies have included Monica Mary Gardner 's Kościuszko : A Biography , which was first published in 1920 , and a 2009 work by Alex <unk> titled The Peasant Prince : Thaddeus Kosciuszko and the Age of Revolution . 
 = Governor of Indiana = 
 The Governor of Indiana is the chief executive of the state of Indiana . The governor is elected to a four @-@ year term , and responsible for overseeing the day @-@ to @-@ day management of the functions of many agencies of the Indiana state government . The governor also shares power with other statewide executive officers , who manage other state government agencies . The governor works out of the Indiana Statehouse and holds official functions at the Indiana Governor 's Residence in the state capital of Indianapolis . 
 The 50th and current governor is Mike Pence , a Republican . 
 The position of governor has developed over the course of two centuries . It has become considerably more powerful since the mid @-@ 20th century after decades of struggle with the Indiana General Assembly and Indiana Supreme Court to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government . Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s , Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their counterparts in most other states . 
 = = Office = = 
 = = = Authority = = = 
 The governor 's powers are established in Article V of the Constitution of Indiana . Constitutionally , the governor has very limited executive authority to manage the government of the state ; most exercisable powers over state agencies are held by independent elected cabinet heads . 
 The governor works in concert with the state legislature ( the bicameral Indiana General Assembly , consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate ) and the state supreme court ( the Supreme Court of Indiana ) to govern the state . The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly . If vetoed , a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration . Unlike other states , most of which require a two @-@ thirds supermajority to override a veto , the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers . 
 One of the governor 's most important political powers is the ability to call a special session of the General Assembly . During a two @-@ year period , the assembly can meet on its own for no more than 91 days , and this often prevents them from passing all the legislation they intend to . This can give the governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with him or her in exchange for a special legislative session . 
 Among his other powers , the governor can call out the state defense force ( the Indiana Guard Reserve ) or the Indiana National Guard in times of emergency or disaster . The governor is also charged with the enforcement of all the state 's laws and the Indiana Code through the Indiana State Police . The governor also has the ability to grant a pardon or commutation of sentence of any person convicted of a crime in the state , except in cases of treason or impeachment . 
 In addition to constitutional powers , governors also have a considerable degree of statutory authority . Most of the authority exercised by governors on a daily basis is derived from statute , giving the General Assembly a great degree of power to expand or contract the governor 's authority . Historically , the party in control of the General Assembly would reassign control of agencies from the governor or to the governor based his party affiliation , and the party affiliation of the cabinet heads , which at times has left the governor with no direct control over state agencies . 
 The governor also can influence the state court system through the appointment of judges . In Indiana , when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court , Tax Court , and circuit courts , the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor , who chooses one . Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana ; if a vacancy occurs ( such as by death or resignation ) the governor may make an appointment , who holds the office until the next general election . The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting the makeup of the judiciary . 
 The annual salary of the governor of Indiana is US $ 111 @,@ 688 ( 2015 ) . Additionally , he receives $ 6 @,@ 000 annually for discretionary spending and expenses . 
 = = = Requirements = = = 
 To become governor of a state , a candidate must be a citizen of the United States and must have been a resident of the state in which they are running for the period of five consecutive years before the election . The candidate must also be at least 30 years old when sworn into office . The governor may not hold any other state or federal office during his term and must resign from any such position before being eligible to be sworn in as governor . Before taking the office , the candidate must swear an oath of office administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indiana , promising to uphold the Constitution and laws of the state . 
 = = = Term limits = = = 
 Once elected , a governor serves a four @-@ year term beginning on the date he is sworn into office ; inauguration day is the second Monday in January . He remains governor until his successor takes the oath of office . The governor 's term can be shorter if he resigns , dies , becomes incapacitated or impeached . There is no limit to how many terms a governor may serve ; however , the governor is limited to being elected to two consecutive terms at a time and may remain in office a maximum of eight years in any twelve @-@ year period . To be eligible to run for a third term , the governor would have to sit out for one election period . 
 = = = Succession = = = 
 If the governor becomes incapacitated , then the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana becomes acting @-@ governor until his recovery . Only two governors have become incapacitated during their terms , and current precedent is that the governor 's office is to notify the lieutenant governor , who will then make the decision to become acting @-@ governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter . The governor can resume his powers & duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office . If the governor resigns , dies , or is impeached , tried , and convicted , then the lieutenant governor becomes governor . If the office of the lieutenant governor is vacant , then the Senate Pro @-@ Tempore becomes governor . If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant , then the Senate must elect a new Pro @-@ Tempore to fill the governor 's office . 
 = = = Residence and offices = = = 
 The governor maintains an office on the first floor of the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis , and from there he manages all of the state 's agencies that are under his jurisdiction . He shares the building with the Indiana General Assembly and the Supreme Court of Indiana . The other elected executive officers , including the attorney general and the lieutenant governor , are also located in the statehouse , but most of the state 's bureaus are located in the state office building . Traditionally , the governor lives in the Indiana Governor 's Residence , also located in Indianapolis ; however , former governor Mitchell Daniels ' family maintained their private home , using the Governor 's Residence only for official functions . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Governors = = = 
 The first Governor of Indiana , Jonathan Jennings , was elected in August 1816 and assumed office in December of that year . The first capital was in Corydon , and the first three governors maintained homes and offices there . The capital was moved to Indianapolis in December 1824 . Governors originally served three @-@ years terms until the constitution was replaced in 1851 . The 1851 constitution extended terms to four years but banned governors from serving consecutive terms . The constitution was amended again in 1972 to allow governors to serve consecutive terms but limited them to two consecutive terms at a time . 
 There have been 50 Governors of Indiana . Republicans and Democrats have each held the position 21 times . Four have died while in office ; seven have resigned . Ten Lieutenant Governors have succeeded to become Governor . James B. Ray has been the only President of the Senate pro tempore to assume the office of Governor . 
 Jonathan Jennings was the first Governor to have an attempted impeachment brought against him in response to his actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary 's in 1819 , illegal under Indiana 's constitution . The evidence of his role was destroyed , and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped . The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor James B. Ray for a similar action in 1826 , but the action was also defeated 28 – 30 . 
 = = = Power shifts = = = 
 Historically , the office of Indiana 's Governor has been a weaker institution relative to the other branches of state government and also when compared to the role of governors of other U.S. states . During Indiana 's territorial period , there was a considerable resentment to the power wielded by the territorial governors , and in response the anti @-@ governor faction , which dominated the constitutional convention , created a weak executive position . The governor was not given complete authority over the militia , his term was set at three years , and most of his actions could be overridden by the General Assembly . The position was steadily weakened by the legislature , and his power was limited further by the constitution of 1851 . The governor 's authority to choose his own appointments for the state courts was removed , and the ability to appoint his own cabinet was ended . The cabinet was effectively made independent by making them elected popularly . The authority to propose budgets was revoked , and serving consecutive terms was banned . By comparison , the Supreme Court was made almost entirely independent , and the General Assembly assumed many of the powers taken from the governor . 
 Governors first began to assert their own power during the American Civil War as the General Assembly attempted to remove command of the militia from the governor . In response , the General Assembly was effectively suppressed , during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials , hire and remove state employees , and manage state finances . When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor , he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers . In 1889 , the General Assembly began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees . The issued ended when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the legislature , again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees . The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor 's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions . 
 With the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s , the governors again began to reassert authority . The Executive Reorganization Act was passed , returning the governor to a considerable level of appointment power . New state welfare and regulatory agencies were placed directly under the governor 's control , greatly expanding his role in running the state and creating a large number of patronage positions . The legislature responded by trying to create a merit system for public offices , but it was largely unable to effectively enforce it given the new scope of government agencies . The battle with the governor continued until 1941 , when the legislature rescinded the Executive Reorganization Act and replaced it with the State Administration Act , which placed most of the government under the control of elected commissioners and reduced the governor 's practical executive authority to commander of the militia and the executor of legislation . The matter was taken to the Supreme Court in the case of Tucker v. State of Indiana . The court ruled for the first time that the governor was in fact the Chief Executive of the state , and that the legislature could pass no law that infringed upon that right . The decision was a major shift from previous court decisions and granted governors a legal basis to resist future encroachment on their powers . 
 During the 1970s , a series of amendments was passed under popular governors that also increased their powers . The state courts were again made appointive , but selection of the candidates was granted to the court @-@ dominated Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission . However , the governor was given more control over the process in which he previously had none . Another amendment removed the ban on consecutive terms , allowing Indiana 's first consecutive term governors in over one hundred years . A third amendment granted the power to prepare a budget to a State Budgetary Agency , which was run by officials appointed by the governor . The significant authority this gave the governor over the budget was the " greatest transfer of power " to the governor yet , according to historian and professor of political science Linda Gugin . 
 Despite gaining considerable power during the mid twentieth @-@ century , the governor is still much weaker than those of other states . He has no line @-@ item veto authority , and the pocket @-@ veto was ruled unconstitutional . If a governor does not sign or reject a bill , it becomes law automatically . This led to a fist fight during the term of Claude Matthews , who was locked out of the House chambers to prevent him from returning a bill in time . Vetoes are also easily overridden , requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a super majority . The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees , but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions , they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system . The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor , and he has control over only half of the government 's agencies , such as the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles . Other large agencies , such as the Department of Administration , are under the control of the cabinet . 
 = = = Veto usage = = = 
 During the state 's early history , vetoes were seldom employed by governors primarily because they were seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority . Governor James Whitcomb was the first to make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session . Roger Branigin , who presided over a hostile legislature , made the most total vetoes of any governor , returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly . Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden , only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden . During the 1970s , for example , 117 bills were vetoed , but only eleven were overridden . Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions , which often do not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice . Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto , even in cases where they supported the bill originally . 
 = = = General Assembly relations = = = 
 The governor 's relationship with the General Assembly has typically been the determining factor in his success at enacting his agenda , although other factors also play an important role . In most of Indiana 's history , the governor has come to power at a time in which his party controlled the assembly . Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010 , thirty @-@ three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate . Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party , while in ninety @-@ eight sessions the governor 's party controlled the entire assembly . 
 Governors who had previously been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor . Three speakers of the house have become governor . Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly . He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption , accusing them of taking bribes from the Bank of Indiana . The legislature responded by overriding all his anti @-@ banking vetoes . He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term . 
 = = = Traits = = = 
 Except for James Whitcomb , all of Indiana 's governors have been married at the time of their election . Whitcomb married while in office . About half of the governors have been married multiple times , all due the death of their first wives . Three governors ' wives , including Whitcomb 's , died while their husbands were in office . Except for Jonathan Jennings and Thomas R. Marshall , all of the state governors have also had children . After leaving office , Marshall adopted a young boy . Only twenty of Indiana 's governors were native to the state . Seven were born in Pennsylvania , four born in Ohio , and four born in Kentucky . Other governors have come from Michigan , Virginia , New York , and Vermont . 
 Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison was appointed to office at age twenty @-@ seven , making him the youngest executive . James B. Ray , elevated at thirty @-@ one and reelected at thirty @-@ two , was the youngest governor to be elected to office . Evan Bayh , at age thirty @-@ four , is the only other governor under the age of forty to be elected . James D. Williams , at age sixty @-@ nine , was oldest governor to be elected and died in office at age seventy @-@ two . The average age of governors at the time of their election is fifty . 
 Thirty @-@ two of Indiana 's governors have served in the military . Veteran organizations have served as a gateway for the governorship . Ira J. Chase served as leader of the Grand Army of the Republic . Paul V. McNutt , Ralph F. Gates , and George N. Craig were leaders of the American Legion , whose national headquarters is in Indianapolis . Thirty governors have been lawyers by profession , and three have been farmers . Thirty received a college education , with eleven of them having attended Indiana University . Several governors have gone on to higher office , with nine serving in the United States Senate , and two serving as Vice President of the United States . 
 = = Gubernatorial elections = = 
 Under the original constitution of 1816 , the state held gubernatorial elections every three years . The first election was held before statehood was approved , in August 1816 . Until the constitution was replaced in 1851 , elections were held in October , and winners took office in December . In 1851 , Indiana adopted its second and current constitution , which banned governors from serving consecutive terms and lengthened terms to four years . Elections since then have been held on Election Day in November during years divisible by four , concurrent with presidential elections . In 1972 a constitutional amendment allowing governors to serve two consecutive four @-@ year terms was approved . 
 = Haakon Lie = 
 Haakon Steen Lie ( 22 September 1905 – 25 May 2009 ) was a Norwegian politician who served as party secretary for the Norwegian Labour Party from 1945 to 1969 . Coming from humble origins , he became involved in the labour movement at an early age , and quickly rose in the party system . After actively working for the resistance movement and the exiled government during World War II , he was elected to the second @-@ highest position in the party after the war , and his years in office were the most successful in the party 's history . 
 Lie is widely considered – along with Einar Gerhardsen – to be the architect of the post @-@ war success of the Labour Party , and of the Norwegian welfare state . At the same time , he has also been the subject of criticism for organising surveillance of Norwegian <unk> , in particular communists . Lie remained active in Norwegian public life , even after his 100th birthday , and in 2008 he celebrated his 103rd birthday with the release of a new biography , " Slik <unk> ser det <unk> " ( As I see it now ) . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Born 22 September 1905 into a family of Finnish origin in Oslo ( then named Kristiania ) , he was baptized Håkon Steen Lie . He would later change the spelling to Haakon during World War II . His father was fireman Andreas Lie ( 1870 @-@ 1942 ) and his mother was homemaker Karen <unk> <unk> ( 1871 @-@ 1952 ) . Though he describes his childhood as a happy one , his family was poor and , until 1916 , his father had to work 120 hours a week . With his parents , two brothers , and two sisters , he grew up at his fathers fire @-@ station sharing one room and a kitchen in the St. Hanshaugen neighborhood . Lie got involved with the labour movement at the age of sixteen , in 1921 . 
 Here he met some of his lifelong friends and colleagues : Martin Tranmæl , Oscar Torp and Einar Gerhardsen . When the Labour Party left the Third Communist International in 1923 , and was split between the new @-@ founded Communist Party and the remaining social democrats , Lie ended up on the latter wing . The bitter strife between the two factions strongly influenced his lifelong anti @-@ communist stance . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 After first attending Møllergata elementary school and later Ila elementary school , he graduated from Secondary school in 1925 and in 1927 , after giving up university studies , ( having attended the State School of Forestry in Kongsberg ) and a brief stint as an industrial worker , he became a forester . He was happy with this occupation , but after a bout of tuberculosis in 1927 , had to give it up as well , and started working as secretary for the party . In 1931 he was made leader of <unk> <unk> ( AOF , Workers ' Information Society ) , an institution recently created to promote education in the working class . Lie has cited the AOF as the proudest achievement of his career . 
 In the early 1930s he made journeys to both Germany and Russia . His experience with authoritarian states – both fascist and communist – helped reinforce his political outlook of a democracy / dictatorship dichotomy rather than a simple right / left one . During the Spanish Civil War in 1936 – 39 , he helped organise aid to those fighting the fascists and , during the winter of 1936 – 37 , he visited the country . At one point the former pacifist Lie also took flying lessons to actively participate in the conflict , but this plan was never carried out . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 When Norway was invaded by Germany in April 1940 , Lie immediately started organising resistance , taking charge of free radio broadcasts from various locations in the country . For two months this work kept him in constant movement around Norway , and on 7 June 1940 , when King Haakon VII and the government left the country for London , he was in Vadsø , replacing a broken transmitter . At this point further broadcasts became impossible , and Lie had to make his way south , through Finland and Sweden , to Oslo . Here he became involved in the underground labour movement , mainly through printing newspapers and spreading information . 
 After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , the occupying authority in Norway started cracking down harder on opposition . A strike over milk rations in September led to the arrest and execution of the two labour leaders Viggo Hansteen and Rolf <unk> . This was followed by several high @-@ profile arrests – among them Einar Gerhardsen – and Lie had to flee the country . He left his house only hours before the Germans appeared to arrest him . From Sweden he made his way to the United Kingdom , where he worked as a propaganda secretary for the exiled Norwegian labour movement in London . He made two visits to the United States to gather support and financial aid , the first time he went from New York to Seattle where he held a series of lectures and radio @-@ interviews before he travelled through Canada from the west- to the east coast . The second trip was as a labour attaché with diplomatic status . While Haakon was in exile , his brother Per , who was also a labour activist , was arrested in Norway in 1942 . He was imprisoned and eventually sent to Dachau , where he died from typhoid fever in March 1945 . 
 = = Party secretary = = 
 On 20 June 1945 , Lie returned to Norway . At the national convention of the Labour Party that same year , he was elected party secretary . While Gerhardsen became chairman and prime minister , and gradually assumed his role as " Father of the Nation " ( " <unk> " ) , Lie maintained party discipline and staked out the political strategy in the background . From his position at the head of the party he helped orchestrate the predominant position the party was to hold in the following years , with absolute parliamentary majorities won in the 1945 , 1949 , 1953 and 1957 elections . During the reconstruction of the post @-@ war years , he helped lead the party onto a more moderate path . Private versus public ownership of industry now became a practical , rather than an ideological question . The policy proved highly successful ; the country experienced unprecedented growth , as well as improved conditions for the working class , during his tenure . 
 = = = Anti @-@ communist surveillance = = = 
 Lie had been personally shaken by the post @-@ war Soviet suppression of the social @-@ democratic parties in Poland , Czechoslovakia and Hungary . He viewed Yugoslavia leader Josip Broz Tito as the " Martin Luther of communism " after Tito had openly defied the Soviet Union by chiselling out the Third Way . When the Soviets initiated a blockade of Yugoslavia following the Tito – Stalin split , Lie organized humanitarian aid @-@ shipments from Norway . Another concern was that the Pro @-@ Moscow Norwegian Communist Party ( NKP ) had was gaining support among leftist voters , with opinion polls showing an increase to 15 @.@ 4 % . As he put it : " It was voting based upon the myth of the Soviet Union as the land of peace and socialism - a myth which had to be broken down " . It was during this period that Lie , with support from the trade union center set up significant and wide @-@ ranging surveillance of Norwegian communists , ( a practice later deemed illegal by a government committee , the Lund commission ) . 
 Lie himself defended his hard @-@ line tactics , claiming communism had represented a threat to democracy as well as the party , famously exclaiming " The Labour Party is no damn Sunday school ! ( Norwegian : <unk> er <unk> ingen <unk> ! ) " . There were also external events that aided his cause . The Marshall Plan accepted in 1947 and the Norwegian membership in NATO from 1949 drew the nation closer to the United States . Meanwhile , the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 demonstrated the threat represented by the Soviet Union . Yet Lie was stronger in his support of the United States , and more fierce in his anti @-@ communism , than most within the Labour party . 
 In 1961 , a left @-@ wing splinter group who was previously centred around the party newspaper " <unk> " decided to break off and form a new party known as Socialist People 's Party ( SF ) . They were later to deny the Labour Party a majority in the 1961 elections as well as to bring down the third cabinet Gerhardsen as a result of the Kings Bay Affair . 
 = = = Feud with Gerhardsen = = = 
 Meanwhile , the relationship between Lie and Gerhardsen grew cooler . Gerhardsen was becoming far more amenable to the Soviets in part due to the influence of his wife , <unk> , who was highly sympathetic to the Soviet Union ( some even claiming she was a KGB informant ) . Gerhardsen had grown more and more frustrated at Lie 's hard @-@ line tactics against communists and perceived Soviet sympathisers , as well as his attempts to stifle foreign policy debate within the Central Committee . Lie on his part grew embittered over what he perceived was the Gerhardsen @-@ couple protecting key leftists , such as Trygve Bull . According to Bull , Lie and Gerhardsen hardly spoke to each other after 1957 . 
 At the national party convention of 1967 Gerhardsen openly attacked Lie , to which Lie reportedly responded by threatening to " break " Gerhardsen " like a louse " ( " <unk> skal <unk> deg som en <unk> " ) . Gerhardsen later regretted the attack , and later sent Lie a letter of apology - to which the latter never replied . Lie resigned as party secretary in 1969 , and Gerhardsen retired from active politics the same year . At was not until 1985 , at the behest of former defence minister Jens Christian Hauge , that the pair officially reconciled . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Lie remained active as a public commentator and in politics after his retirement from party politics , and even after his centenary . He led the losing campaign for Norwegian membership in the EEC in the early 1970s , and in 2000 he led a battle to prevent the privatisation of the national oil company Statoil . His preferred method of staying updated on current international events was through weekly readings of The Economist . 
 Influenced by the support he experienced from Jewish labour leaders in the United States , he was a supporter of the state of Israel , though he is highly critical of the Israeli government 's current treatment of the Palestinians and to the settlement of the West Bank . 
 Lie initiated Operation donor funds for construction of Israeli settlement called " <unk> Norge " ( Change to <unk> ) in memory of 28 children crashes in Hurum air disaster . 
 He wrote several books , among them the controversial memoir ... <unk> <unk> ser det ( " ... the way I see it " , 1975 ) , in which he strongly attacked Gerhardsen . He also wrote a two @-@ volume biography of his mentor Martin Tranmæl , Et <unk> av <unk> and <unk> ( " A Beacon of Resolve " , 1988 and " The Pathfinder " , 1991 ) . In his latest book , released in 2008 at 103 years of age , being traditionally a strong proponent of cooperation with the United States , he called for enhanced security cooperation between the Nordic countries and argued Norway should buy the Swedish JAS Gripen aircraft instead of the US @-@ made Joint Strike Fighter . 
 In 1970 , after retiring as party secretary , he acquired a patch of woodland where he could resume his passion for forestry . For many years he spent his winters in the US state of Florida , but eventually moved back permanently to Norway . 
 Lie died on 25 May 2009 , aged 103 , after a long illness . He had been hospitalised six months earlier . Friends of Israel in the Norwegian Labour Movement ( Norwegian : Venner av Israel i Norsk <unk> ) , planted a forest to his memory in Israel . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Lie was married twice – first in 1929 to Ragnhild Halvorsen ( 1905 @-@ 91 ) a companion from the labour youth movement . They divorced in 1951 because when he was in America he met Minnie Dockterman , who would be his future wife , thereby creating a scandal . He married Minnie Dockterman in 1952 ( 1912 – 99 ) . He left three daughters , two ; Gro ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) by his first wife and one ; Karen ( 1952 ) by the second wife . In addition he left five grandchildren as well as six great @-@ grandchildren . 
 = The Red Badge of Courage = 
 The Red Badge of Courage is a war novel by American author Stephen Crane ( 1871 – 1900 ) . Taking place during the American Civil War , the story is about a young private of the Union Army , Henry Fleming , who flees from the field of battle . Overcome with shame , he longs for a wound , a " red badge of courage , " to counteract his cowardice . When his regiment once again faces the enemy , Henry acts as standard @-@ bearer . 
 Although Crane was born after the war , and had not at the time experienced battle first @-@ hand , the novel is known for its realism . He began writing what would become his second novel in 1893 , using various contemporary and written accounts ( such as those published previously by Century Magazine ) as inspiration . It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of Chancellorsville ; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment , commonly known as the Orange Blossoms . Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894 , the novel was published in full in October 1895 . A longer version of the work , based on Crane 's original manuscript , was published in 1982 . 
 The novel is known for its distinctive style , which includes realistic battle sequences as well as the repeated use of color imagery , and ironic tone . Separating itself from a traditional war narrative , Crane 's story reflects the inner experience of its protagonist ( a soldier fleeing from combat ) rather than the external world around him . Also notable for its use of what Crane called a " psychological portrayal of fear " , the novel 's allegorical and symbolic qualities are often debated by critics . Several of the themes that the story explores are maturation , heroism , cowardice , and the indifference of nature . The Red Badge of Courage garnered widespread acclaim , what H. G. Wells called " an orgy of praise " , shortly after its publication , making Crane an instant celebrity at the age of twenty @-@ four . The novel and its author did have their initial detractors , however , including author and veteran Ambrose Bierce . Adapted several times for the screen , the novel became a bestseller . It has never been out of print and is now thought to be Crane 's most important work and a major American text .

 Stephen Crane published his first novel , Maggie : A Girl of the Streets , in March 1893 at the age of 22 . Maggie was not a success , either financially or critically . Most critics thought the unsentimental Bowery tale crude or vulgar , and Crane chose to publish the work privately after it was repeatedly rejected for publication . Crane found inspiration for his next novel while spending hours lounging in a friend 's studio in the early summer of 1893 . There , he became fascinated with issues of Century Magazine that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the Civil War . Frustrated with the dryly written stories , Crane stated , " I wonder that some of those fellows don 't tell how they felt in those scraps . They spout enough of what they did , but they 're as emotionless as rocks . " Returning to these magazines during subsequent visits to the studio , he decided to write a war novel . He later stated that he " had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out through most of his boyhood " and had imagined " war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers . " 
 At the time , Crane was intermittently employed as a free @-@ lance writer , contributing articles to various New York City newspapers . He began writing what would become The Red Badge of Courage in June 1893 , while living with his older brother Edmund in Lake View , New Jersey . Crane conceived the story from the point of view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war , only to become disillusioned by war 's reality . He took the private 's surname , " Fleming , " from his sister @-@ in @-@ law 's maiden name . He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with " every word in place , every comma , every period fixed . " Working mostly nights , he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning . Because he could not afford a typewriter , he carefully wrote in ink on legal @-@ sized paper , occasionally crossing through or overlying a word . If he changed something , he would rewrite the whole page . He later moved to New York City , where he completed the novel in April 1894 . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The title of Crane 's original , 55 @,@ 000 @-@ word manuscript was " Private Fleming / His various battles " , but in order to create the sense of a less traditional Civil War narrative , he ultimately changed the title to The Red Badge of Courage : An Episode of the American Civil War . In early 1894 , Crane submitted the manuscript to S. S. McClure , who held on to it for six months without publication . Frustrated , the author asked for the manuscript to be returned , after which he gave it to Irving Bacheller in October . An abbreviated version of Crane 's story was first serialized in The Philadelphia Press in December 1894 . This version of the story , which was culled to 18 @,@ 000 words by an editor specifically for the serialization , was reprinted in newspapers across America , establishing Crane 's fame . Crane biographer John Berryman wrote that the story was published in at least 200 small city dailies and approximately 550 weekly papers . In October 1895 , a version , which was 5 @,@ 000 words shorter than the original manuscript , was printed in book form by D. Appleton & Company . This version of the novel differed greatly from Crane 's original manuscript ; the deletions were thought by some scholars to be due to demands by an Appleton employee who was afraid of public disapproval of the novel 's content . Parts of the original manuscript removed from the 1895 version include all of the twelfth chapter , as well as the endings to chapters seven , ten and fifteen . The handwritten original of the novel , as well as dozens of published editions , manuscript correspondence , and additional material related to the book 's editorial and publication history , reside at the University of Virginia in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library . 
 Crane 's contract with Appleton allowed him to receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold . However , the contract also stipulated that he was not to receive royalties from the books sold in Great Britain , where they were released by Heinemann in early 1896 as part of its Pioneer Series . In 1982 , W. W. Norton & Company published a version of the novel based on Crane 's original 1894 manuscript of 55 @,@ 000 words . Edited by Henry Binder , this version is questioned by those who believe Crane made the original edits for the 1895 Appleton edition on his own accord . Since its initial publication , the novel has never gone out of print . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 On a cold day the fictional 304th New York Regiment awaits battle beside a river . Eighteen @-@ year @-@ old Private Henry Fleming , remembering his romantic reasons for enlisting as well as his mother 's resulting protests , wonders whether he will remain brave in the face of fear , or turn and run . He is comforted by one of his friends from home , Jim Conklin , who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled . During the regiment 's first battle , Confederate soldiers charge , but are repelled . The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again , this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee . Fearing the battle is a lost cause , Henry deserts his regiment . It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union 's victory . 
 Ashamed , Henry escapes into a nearby forest , where he discovers a decaying body in a peaceful clearing . In his distress , he hurriedly leaves the clearing and stumbles upon a group of injured men returning from battle . One member of the group , a " tattered soldier " , asks Henry where he is wounded , but the youth dodges the question . Among the group is Jim Conklin , who has been shot in the side and is suffering delirium from blood @-@ loss . Jim eventually dies of his injury , defiantly resisting aid from his friend , and an enraged and helpless Henry runs from the wounded soldiers . He next joins a retreating column that is in disarray . In the ensuing panic , a man hits Henry on the head with his rifle , wounding him . Exhausted , hungry , thirsty , and now wounded , Henry decides to return to his regiment regardless of his shame . When he arrives at camp , the other soldiers believe his injury resulted from a grazing bullet during battle . The other men care for the youth , dressing his wound . 
 The next morning Henry goes into battle for the third time . His regiment encounters a small group of Confederates , and in the ensuing fight Henry proves to be a capable soldier , comforted by the belief that his previous cowardice had not been noticed , as he " had performed his mistakes in the dark , so he was still a man " . Afterward , while looking for a stream from which to obtain water with a friend , he discovers from the commanding officer that his regiment has a lackluster reputation . The officer speaks casually about sacrificing the 304th because they are nothing more than " mule drivers " and " mud diggers . " With no other regiments to spare , the general orders his men forward . 
 In the final battle , Henry acts as the flag @-@ bearer after the color sergeant falls . A line of Confederates hidden behind a fence beyond a clearing shoots with impunity at Henry 's regiment , which is ill @-@ covered in the tree @-@ line . Facing withering fire if they stay and disgrace if they retreat , the officers order a charge . <unk> , Henry leads the men while entirely escaping injury . Most of the Confederates run before the regiment arrives , and four of the remaining men are taken prisoner . The novel closes with the following passage : 
 It rained . The procession of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train , despondent and muttering , marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low , wretched sky . Yet the youth smiled , for he saw that the world was a world for him , though many discovered it to be made of oaths and walking sticks . He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle . The sultry nightmare was in the past . He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war . He turned now with a lover 's thirst to images of tranquil skies , fresh meadows , cool brooks , an existence of soft and eternal peace . 
 Over the river a golden ray of sun came through the hosts of leaden rain clouds . 
 = = Historical accuracy and inspiration = = 
 Although Crane once wrote in a letter , " You can tell nothing ... unless you are in that condition yourself , " he wrote The Red Badge of Courage without any experience of war . He would , however , later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco @-@ Turkish and Spanish – American Wars . Nevertheless , the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in The Red Badge of Courage has often misled readers into thinking that Crane ( despite being born six years after the end of the Civil War ) was himself a veteran . While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically , Crane stated : " Of course , I have never been in a battle , but I believe that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field , or else fighting is a hereditary instinct , and I wrote intuitively ; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days " . 
 Crane drew from a variety of sources in order to realistically depict battle . Century 's " Battles and Leaders " series served as direct inspiration for the novel , and one story in particular ( Warren Lee Goss 's " Recollections of a Private " ) contains many parallels to Crane 's work . Thomas Beer wrote in his problematic 1923 biography that Crane was challenged by a friend to write The Red Badge of Courage after having announced that he could do better than Émile Zola 's La <unk> . This anecdote , however , has not been substantiated . The metaphor of the " red badge of courage " itself may have been inspired by true events ; historian Cecil D. Eby , Jr. noted that Union officer Philip Kearny 's insisted his troops wear bright red unit insignia patches , which became known as marks of valor and bravery . While the 304th New York Volunteer Infantry is fictional , many strategies and occurrences in the novel echo actual events during the Civil War . Details concerning specific campaigns during the war , especially regarding battle formations and actions during the Battle of Chancellorsville , have been noted by critics . 
 It is believed that Crane listened to war stories in the town square of Port Jervis , New York ( where his family at times resided ) told by members of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment , commonly known as the Orange Blossoms . The Orange Blossoms first saw battle at Chancellorsville , which is believed by local historians to have been the inspiration for the battle depicted in The Red Badge of Courage . Furthermore , there was a Private James Conklin who served in the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment , and Crane 's short story " The Veteran " , which was published in McClure 's Magazine the year after The Red Badge of Courage , depicts an elderly Henry Fleming who specifically identifies his first combat experience as having occurred at Chancellorsville . 
 = = Style and genre = = 
 The Red Badge of Courage has a distinctive style , which is often described as naturalistic , realistic , impressionistic or a mixture of the three . Told in a third @-@ person limited point of view , the novel reflects the inner @-@ experience of Henry Fleming , a young soldier who flees from combat , rather than upon the external world around him . The Red Badge of Courage is notable in its vivid descriptions and well @-@ cadenced prose , both of which help create suspense within the story . Critics in particular have pointed to the repeated use of color imagery throughout the novel , both literal and figurative , as proof of the novel 's use of Impressionism . Blue and gray uniforms are mentioned , as are yellow and orange sunlight , and green forests , while men 's faces grow red with rage or courage , and gray with death . Crane also uses animalistic imagery to comment upon people , nature , and war itself . For example , the novel begins by portraying the army as a living entity that is " stretched out on the hills , resting . " 
 While the novel takes place during a series of battles , The Red Badge of Courage is not a traditional Civil War narrative . Focusing on the complex internal struggle of its main character , rather than on the war itself , Crane 's novel often divides readers as to whether the story is intended to be either for or against war . By avoiding political , military , and geographic details of the conflict between the states , the story becomes divorced from its historical context . Notably lacking are the dates in which the action takes place , and the name of the battle ; these omissions effectively shift attention away from historical patterns in order to concentrate on the emotional violence of battle in general . The writer alluded to as much in a letter , in which he stated he wished to depict war through " a psychological portrayal of fear . " 
 Writing more than thirty years after the novel 's debut , author Joseph Conrad agreed that the novel 's main struggle was internal rather than external , and that Fleming " stands before the unknown . He would like to prove to himself by some reasoning process that he will not ' run from the battle ' . And in his <unk> regiment he can find no help . He is alone with the problem of courage . " Crane 's realistic portrayal of the psychological struck a chord with reviewers ; as one contemporary critic wrote for The New York Press : " At times the description is so vivid as to be almost suffocating . The reader is right down in the midst of it where patriotism is dissolved into its elements and where only a dozen men can be seen , firing blindly and grotesquely into the smoke . This is war from a new point of view . " 
 With its heavy use of irony , symbolism and metaphor , the novel also lends itself to less straightforward readings . As with many of Crane 's fictional works , the novel 's dialogue often uses distinctive local dialects , contributing to its apparent historicity ; for example , Jim Conklin muses at the beginning of the novel : " I s <unk> we must go <unk> ' ' round th ' <unk> jest t ' keep ' em from <unk> ' too <unk> , or t <unk> 'm , or something " . The ironic tone increases in severity as the novel progresses , especially in terms of the ironic distance between the narrator and protagonist . The title of the work itself is ironic ; Henry wishes " that he , too , had a wound , a red badge of courage " , echoing a wish to have been wounded in battle . The wound he does receive ( from the rifle butt of a fleeing Union soldier ) , however , is not a badge of courage but a badge of shame . 
 By substituting epithets for characters ' names ( " the youth " , " the tattered soldier " ) , Crane injects an allegorical quality into his work , making his characters point to a specific characteristic of man . There have been numerous interpretations concerning hidden meanings within The Red Badge of Courage . Beginning with Robert W. Stallman 's 1968 Crane biography , several critics have explored the novel in terms of Christian allegory . In particular , the death of Henry Fleming 's Christ @-@ like friend , Jim Conklin , is noted for evidence of this reading , as well as the concluding sentence of chapter nine , which refers to the sun as " fierce wafer " in the sky . John Berryman was one of the first critics to interpret the novel as a modern wasteland through which the protagonist plays the role of an Everyman . Still others read the novel as having a Naturalist structure , comparing the work to those by Theodore Dreiser , Frank Norris and Jack London . 
 = = Themes = = 
 As the title of the work suggests , the main theme of the novel deals with Henry Fleming 's attempt to prove himself a worthy soldier by earning his " red badge of courage " . The first twelve chapters , until he receives his accidental wound , expose his cowardice . The following chapters detail his growth and apparently resulting heroism . Before the onset of battle , the novel 's protagonist romanticized war ; what little he knew about battle he learned from books : " He had read of marches , sieges , conflicts , and he had longed to see it all " . Therefore , when confronted by the harsh realities of war , Henry is shocked , and his idealism falters . Finding solace in existential thoughts , he internally fights to make sense of the senseless world in which he finds himself . When he seems to come to terms with his situation , he is yet again forced into the fears of battle , which threaten to strip him of his enlightened identity . Joseph Hergesheimer wrote in his introduction to the 1925 Knopf edition of the novel that , at its heart , The Red Badge of Courage was a " story of the birth , in a boy , of a knowledge of himself and of self @-@ command . " 
 However , the text is ambiguous , making it questionable that Henry ever matures . As critic Donald Gibson stated in The Red Badge of Courage : Redefining the Hero , " the novel undercuts itself . It says there is no answer to the questions it raises ; yet it says the opposite .... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are ; it says he is a deluded fool . It says that Henry does not see things as they are ; but no one else does either . " Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry 's " spiritual change " by the end of the story , he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel 's enigmatic ending . Although Henry " progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph " , as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous " romantic notions , " " the education of the hero ends as it began : in self deception . " Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel 's heroism paradox , especially in terms of the introspective Henry 's lapse into unreasoning self @-@ abandon in the second half of the book . Dillingham stated that " in order to be courageous , a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities , reason and imagination , and act instinctively , even <unk> . " 
 The indifference of the natural world is a reoccurring theme in Crane 's work . At the beginning of the novel , as the regiments advance toward battle , the sky is described as being an innocuous " fairy blue . " In chapter seven , Henry notes the inexplicable tranquility of nature , " a woman with a deep aversion to tragedy " , even as the battle rages on . Similarly , Heaven itself is indifferent to the slaughter he encounters on the battlefield . The dichotomy between nature 's sweetness and war 's destructiveness is further described in chapter eighteen : " A cloud of dark smoke as from smoldering ruins went up toward the sun now bright and gay in the blue , enameled sky . " After his desertion , however , Henry finds some comfort in the laws of nature , which seem to briefly affirm his previous cowardice : 
 This landscape gave him assurance . A fair field holding life . It was the religion of peace . It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood .... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel , and he ran with chattering fear . High in a treetop he stopped , and , poking his head cautiously from behind a branch , looked down with an air of trepidation . The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition . There was the law , he said . Nature had given him a sign . The squirrel , immediately upon recognizing danger , had taken to his legs without ado . He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile , and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens . On the contrary , he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him .

 The Red Badge of Courage received generally positive reviews from critics on its initial publication ; in particular , it was said to be a remarkably modern and original work . Appleton 's 1895 publication went through ten editions in the first year alone , making Crane an overnight success at the age of twenty @-@ four . H. G. Wells , a friend of the author , later wrote that the novel was greeted by an " orgy of praise " in England and the United States . An anonymous reviewer for The New York Press wrote shortly after the novel 's initial publication that " One should be forever slow in charging an author with genius , but it must be confessed that The Red Badge of Courage is open to the suspicion of having greater power and originality than can be girdled by the name of talent . " The reviewer for The New York Times was impressed by Crane 's realistic portrayal of war , writing that the book " strikes the reader as a statement of facts by a veteran " , a sentiment that was echoed by the reviewer for The Critic , who called the novel " a true book ; true to life , whether it be taken as a literal transcript of a soldier 's experiences in his first battle , or ... a great parable of the inner battle which every man must fight . " 
 The novel , however , did have its initial detractors . Some critics found Crane 's young age and inexperience troubling , rather than impressive . For example , one reviewer wrote , " As Mr. Crane is too young a man to write from experience , the frightful details of his book must be the outcome of a very feverish imagination . " Crane and his work also received criticism from veterans of the war ; one in particular , Alexander C. McClurg , a brigadier general who served through the Chickamauga and Chattanooga campaigns , wrote a lengthy letter to The Dial ( which his publishing company owned ) in April 1896 , lambasting the novel as " a vicious satire upon American soldiers and American armies . " Author and veteran Ambrose Bierce , popular for his Civil War @-@ fiction , also expressed contempt for the novel and its writer . When a reviewer for The New York Journal referred to The Red Badge of Courage as a poor imitation of Bierce 's work , Bierce responded by congratulating them for exposing " the Crane freak " . Some reviewers also found fault with Crane 's narrative style , grammar mistakes , and apparent lack of traditional plot . 
 While it eventually became a bestseller in the United States , The Red Badge of Courage was more popular and sold more rapidly in England when it was published in late 1895 . Crane was delighted with his novel 's success overseas , writing to a friend : " I have only one pride and that is that the English edition of The Red Badge of Courage has been received [ sic ] with great praise by the English reviewers . I am proud of this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win . " Critic , veteran and Member of Parliament George Wyndham called the novel a " masterpiece " , applauding Crane 's ability to " stage the drama of man , so to speak , within the mind of one man , and then admits you as to a theatre . " Harold Frederic wrote in his own review that " If there were in existence any books of a similar character , one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind . But it has no fellows . It is a book outside of all classification . So unlike anything else is it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all " . Frederic , who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897 , juxtaposed the novel 's treatment of war to those by Leo Tolstoy , Émile Zola and Victor Hugo , all of whose works he believed to be " positively ... cold and ineffectual " when compared to The Red Badge of Courage .

 Crane himself later wrote about the novel : " I don 't think The Red Badge to be any great shakes but then the very theme of it gives it an intensity that the writer cant [ sic ] reach every day . " For the remainder of Crane 's short career ( he died from tuberculosis at the age of 28 ) The Red Badge of Courage served as the standard against which the rest of his works were compared . Appleton republished the novel again in 1917 , shortly after the US entered World War I , reissuing it three additional times that same year . 
 Since the resurgence of Crane 's popularity in the 1920s , The Red Badge of Courage has been deemed a major American text , and Crane 's most important work . While modern critics have noted Crane 's " anticipation of the modern spectacle of war " , others , such as Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim , believe the work to be " unquestionably the most realistic novel about the American Civil War " . Donald Gibson called the novel " ahead of its time " because it did " not conform to very many contemporary notions about what literature should be and do . " The novel has been anthologized numerous times , including in Ernest Hemingway 's 1942 collection Men at War : The Best War Stories of All Time . In the introduction , Hemingway wrote that the novel " is one of the finest books of our literature , and I include it entire because it is all as much of a piece as a great poem is . " Robert W. Stallman 's introduction to the Modern Library 's 1951 edition of The Red Badge of Courage contained one of the first modern assessments of the novel . 
 The novel has been adapted several times for the screen . A 1951 film by the same name was directed by John Huston , starring Medal of Honor @-@ winner Audie Murphy as Henry Fleming . Written by Huston and Albert Band , the film suffered from a troubled production history , went over budget , and was cut down to only seventy minutes despite objections from the director . A made @-@ for @-@ television movie was released in 1974 , starring Richard Thomas as Fleming , while the 2008 Czech film Tobruk was partly based on The Red Badge of Courage . 
 In 1957 , actor Edmond O 'Brien had a spoken @-@ word recording of The Red Badge of Courage ( Caedmon TC 1040 ) . Billboard said " Edmond O 'Brien brings intensity in the narrative portions and successfully impersonates the varied characters in dialog . " 
 The main character in the Nintendo 3DS Videogame Code Name : S.T.E.A.M. is named after and based upon Henry Fleming , the protagonist from the book The Red Badge of Courage . 
 = Philomela = 
 Philomela ( / <unk> / ) or Philomel ( / <unk> / ; Ancient Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) is a minor figure in Greek mythology and is frequently invoked as a direct and figurative symbol in literary , artistic , and musical works in the Western canon . 
 She is identified as being the " princess of Athens " and the younger of two daughters of Pandion I , King of Athens , and <unk> . Her sister , Procne , was the wife of King Tereus of Thrace . While the myth has several variations , the general depiction is that Philomela , after being raped and mutilated by her sister 's husband , Tereus , obtains her revenge and is transformed into a nightingale ( Luscinia <unk> ) , a migratory passerine bird native to Europe and southwest Asia and noted for its song . Because of the violence associated with the myth , the song of the nightingale is often depicted or interpreted as a sorrowful lament . Coincidentally , in nature , the female nightingale is mute and only the male of the species sings . 
 Ovid and other writers have made the association ( either fancifully or mistakenly ) that the etymology of her name was " lover of song , " derived from the Greek <unk> and <unk> ( " song " ) instead of <unk> ( " fruit " or " sheep " ) . The name means " lover of fruit , " " lover of apples , " or " lover of sheep . " 
 = = The story of Philomela in myth = = 
 The most complete and extant rendering of the story of Philomela , Procne , and Tereus can be found in Book VI of the Metamorphoses of the Roman poet Ovid ( Publius <unk> <unk> ) ( 43 BC – AD 17 / 18 ) , where the story reaches its full development during antiquity . It is likely that Ovid relied upon Greek and Latin sources that were available in his era such as the Bibliotheca of Pseudo @-@ Apollodorus ( 2nd century BC ) , or sources that are no longer extant or exist today only in fragments — especially Sophocles ' tragic drama Tereus ( 5th century BC ) . 
 According to Ovid , in the fifth year of Procne 's marriage to Tereus , King of Thrace and son of Ares , she asked her husband to " Let me at Athens my dear sister see / Or let her come to Thrace , and visit me . " <unk> his wife 's request , Tereus agreed to travel to Athens and escort Philomela , his wife 's sister , to Thrace . King Pandion of Athens , the father of Philomela and Procne , was apprehensive about letting his only remaining daughter leave his home and protection and asks Tereus to protect her as if he were her father . Tereus agrees . However , Tereus lusted for Philomela when he first saw her , and that lust grew during the course of the return voyage to Thrace . 
 Arriving in Thrace , he forced her to a cabin or lodge in the woods and raped her . After the assault , Tereus threatened her and advised her to keep silent . Philomela was defiant and angered Tereus . In his rage , he cut out her tongue and abandoned her in the cabin . In Ovid 's Metamorphoses Philomela 's defiant speech is rendered ( in an 18th @-@ century English translation ) as : 
 Rendered unable to speak because of her injuries , Philomela wove a tapestry ( or a robe ) that told her story and had it sent to Procne . Procne was incensed and in revenge , she killed her son by Tereus , Itys ( or <unk> ) , boiled him and served him as a meal to her husband . After Tereus ate Itys , the sisters presented him with the severed head of his son , and he became aware of their conspiracy and his cannibalistic meal . He snatched up an axe and pursued them with the intent to kill the sisters . They fled but were almost overtaken by Tereus at <unk> in Phocis . In desperation , they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus ' rage and vengeance . The gods transformed Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale . Subsequently , the gods would transform Tereus into a hoopoe . 
 = = = Variations on the myth = = = 
 It is typical for myths from antiquity to have been altered over the passage of time or for competing variations of the myth to emerge . With the story of Philomela , most of the variations concern which sister became the nightingale or the swallow , and into what type of bird Tereus was transformed . Since Ovid 's Metamorphoses , it has been generally accepted that Procne was transformed into a nightingale , and Philomela into a swallow . The description of Tereus as an " epops " has generally been translated as a hoopoe ( scientific name : Upupa epops ) . Since many of the earlier sources are no longer extant , or remain only fragments , Ovid 's version of the myth has been the most lasting and influenced most later works . 
 Early Greek sources have it that Philomela was turned into a swallow , which has no song ; Procne turns into a nightingale , singing a beautiful but sad song in remorse . Later sources , among them Ovid , Hyginus , and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo @-@ Apollodorus , and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was <unk> , Philomela was turned into a nightingale , and Procne into a swallow . Eustathius ' version of the story has the sisters reversed , so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne . 
 It is salient to note that in taxonomy and binomial nomenclature , the genus name of the martins ( the larger @-@ bodied among swallow genera ) is <unk> , a Latinized form of Procne . Other related genera named after the myth include the Crag Martins Ptyonoprogne , and Saw @-@ wings <unk> . Coincidentally , although most of the depictions of the nightingale and its song in art and literature are of female nightingales , the female of the species does not sing — it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song . 
 In an early account , Sophocles wrote that Tereus was turned into a large @-@ beaked bird whom some scholars translate as a hawk while a number of retellings and other works ( including Aristophanes ' ancient comedy , The Birds ) hold that Tereus was instead changed into a hoopoe . Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus was transformed into other birds than the hawk and hoopoe , including references by Dryden and Gower to the lapwing . 
 Several writers omit key details of the story . According to Pausanias , Tereus was so remorseful for his actions against Philomela and Itys ( the nature of the actions is not described ) that he kills himself . Then two birds appear as the women lament his death . Many later sources omit the Tereus ' tongue @-@ cutting mutilation of Philomela altogether . 
 According to Thucydides , Tereus was not King of Thrace , but rather from the city of <unk> in Phocis , a city inhabited by Thracians . He cites in proof of this that poets who mention the nightingale refer to it as a " <unk> bird . " It is thought that Thucydides commented on the myth in his famous work on the Peloponnesian War because Sophocles ' play confused the mythical Tereus with contemporary ruler Teres I of Thrace . 
 = = = Elements borrowed from other myths and stories = = = 
 The story of Philomela , Procne and Tereus is largely influenced by the lost tragedy Tereus of Sophocles . Scholar Jenny Marsh claims that Sophocles borrowed certain plot elements from Euripides drama Medea — notably a wife killing her child in an act of revenge against her husband — and incorporated them in his tragedy Tereus . She implies that the infanticide of Itys did not appear in the Tereus myth until Sophocles ' play and that it was introduced because of what was borrowed from Euripides . 
 It is possible that social and political themes have woven their way into the story as a contrast between Athenians who believed themselves to be the hegemonic power in Greece and the more civilized of the Greek peoples , and the Thracians who were considered to be a " barbaric race . " It is possible that these elements were woven into Sophocles ' play Tereus and other works of the period . 
 = = Appearances in the Western canon = = 
 The material of the Philomela myth has been used in various creative works — artistic and literary — for the past 2 @,@ 500 years . Over the centuries , the myth has been associated with the image of the nightingale and its song described as both exceedingly beautiful and sorrowful . The continued use of the image in artistic , literary , and musical works has reinforced this association . 
 = = = From antiquity and the influence of Ovid = = = 
 Beginning with Homer 's Odyssey , ancient dramatists and poets evoked the story of Philomela and the nightingale in their works . Most notably , it was the core of the tragedy Tereus by Sophocles ( lost , extant only in fragments ) , and later in a set of plays by <unk> , the nephew of the great playwright Aeschylus . In Aeschylus 's Agamemnon , the prophetess Cassandra has a visionary premonition of her own death in which she mentioned the nightingale and Itys , lamenting : 
 In his Poetics , Aristotle points to the ″ voice of the shuttle ″ in Sophocles ′ tragedy Tereus as an example of a poetic device that aids in the ″ recognition ″ — the change from ignorance to knowledge — of what has happened earlier in the plot . Such a device , according to Aristotle , is ″ contrived ″ by the poet , and thus is ″ inartistic . ″ . The connection between the nightingale 's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the poetry of Callimachus . Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “ lament of the nightingale ” . 
 While Ovid 's retelling of the myth is the more famous version of the story , he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he finished the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8 . Many of these sources were doubtless available to Ovid during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments . In his version , Ovid recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources . Because his is the most complete , lasting version of the myth , it is the basis for many later works . 
 In the 12th century , French <unk> ( troubadour ) Chrétien de Troyes , adapted many of the myths recounted in Ovid 's Metamorphoses into Old French . However , de Troyes was not alone in making use of Ovid 's material . Geoffrey Chaucer recounted the story in his unfinished work The Legend of Good Women and briefly alluded to the myth in his Troilus and Criseyde . John Gower included the tale in his Confessio Amantis . References to Philomela are common in the motets of the ars nova , ars <unk> , and ars <unk> musical eras of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries . 
 = = = In <unk> and Jacobean England = = = 
 Throughout the late Renaissance and <unk> eras , the image of Philomela and the nightingale incorporated elements of mourning and beauty after being subjected to an act of violence . In the long poem " The Steele Glas " ( 1576 ) , poet George Gascoigne ( 1535 – 1577 ) depicts " Philomel " as the representative of poetry ( <unk> ) , her sister <unk> as satire ( <unk> ) , and Tereus as " <unk> Delight . " The characterization of Philomela and the nightingale was that of a woman choosing to exercise her will in recovering her voice and resisting those forces which attempts to silence her . Critics have pointed to Gascoigne 's use of the Philomela myth as a personal appeal and that he was fighting in verse a battle with his enemies who violently opposed his poems . In his poem " The <unk> of <unk> " ( 1576 ) , the myth is employed to depict punishment and control . 
 In " The Nymph 's Reply to the Shepherd " , Sir Walter Raleigh ( 1554 – 1618 ) relays consolation regarding the nymph 's harsh rejection of the shepherd 's romantic advances in the spirit of " time heals all wounds , " by citing in the second stanza ( among several examples ) that eventually with the passage of time Philomel would become " dumb " to her own pain and that her attention would be drawn away from the pain by the events of life to come . 
 In Sir Philip Sidney 's ( 1554 – 1586 ) courtly love poem " The Nightingale " , Sydney 's narrator who is in love with a woman he cannot have compares his own romantic situation to that of Philomela 's plight and claims that he has more reason to be sad . However , recent literary criticism has labelled this claim as sexist and an unfortunate marginalization of the traumatic rape of Philomela . Sydney argues that the rape was an " excess of love " and less severe than being deprived of love as attested by the line , " Since wanting is more woe than too much having . " 
 Playwright and poet William Shakespeare ( 1564 – 1616 ) makes frequent use of the Philomela myth — most notably in his tragedy Titus Andronicus ( c . 1588 – 1593 ) where characters directly reference Tereus and Philomela in commenting on rape and mutilation of Lavinia by Aaron , Chiron , and Demetrius . Prominent allusions to Philomela also occur in the depiction of Lucrece in The Rape of Lucrece , in the depiction of Imogen in Cymbeline , and in Titania 's lullaby in A Midsummer Night 's Dream where she asks Philomel to " sing in our sweet lullaby " . In Sonnet 102 , Shakespeare addresses his lover ( the " fair youth " ) and compares his love poetry to the song of the nightingale , noting that " her mournful hymns did hush the night " ( line 10 ) , and that as a poet would " hold his tongue " ( line 13 ) in deference to the more beautiful nightingale 's song so that he " not dull you with my song " ( line 14 ) . Emilia Lanyer ( 1569 – 1645 ) , a poet who is considered by some scholars to be the woman referred to in the poetry of William Shakespeare as " Dark Lady " , makes several references to Philomela in her patronage poem " The Description of <unk> " in Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum ( 1611 ) . Lanyer 's poem , dedicated to Margaret Clifford , Countess of Cumberland and her daughter Lady Anne Clifford refers to Philomela 's " sundry <unk> " ( line 31 ) and later to her " mournful ditty " ( line 189 ) . 
 The image of the nightingale appears frequently in poetry of the period with it and its song described by poets as an example of " joyance " and gaiety or as an example of melancholy , sad , sorrowful , and mourning . However , many use the nightingale as a symbol of sorrow but without a direct reference to the Philomela myth . 
 = = = In Classical and Romantic works = = = 
 Poets in the Romantic Era recast the myth and adapted the image of the nightingale with its song to be a poet and “ master of a superior art that could inspire the human poet ” . For some romantic poets , the nightingale even began to take on qualities of the muse . John Keats ( 1795 – 1821 ) , in " Ode to a Nightingale " ( 1819 ) idealizes the nightingale as a poet who has achieved the poetry that Keats himself longs to write . Keats directly employs the Philomel myth in " The Eve of St. Agnes " ( 1820 ) where the rape of Madeline by <unk> mirrors the rape of Philomela by Tereus . Keats ' contemporary , poet Percy Bysshe Shelley ( 1792 – 1822 ) invoked a similar image of the nightingale , writing in his A Defence of Poetry that " a poet is a nightingale who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds ; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician , who feel that they are moved and softened , yet know not whence or why . ” 
 First published in the collection Lyrical Ballads , " The Nightingale " ( 1798 ) is an effort by Samuel Taylor Coleridge ( 1772 – 1834 ) to move away from associations that the nightingale 's song was one of melancholy and identified it with the joyous experience of nature . He remarked that " in nature there is nothing melancholy , " ( line 15 ) expressing hope " we may not thus profane / Nature ’ s sweet voices , always full of love / And joyance ! " ( lines 40 – 42 ) . 
 At the poem 's conclusion , Coleridge writes of a father taking his crying son outside in the night : 
 Coleridge , and his friend William Wordsworth ( 1770 – 1850 ) who called the nightingale a " fiery heart , " depicted the bird " as an instance of natural poetic creation , " and as the " voice of nature . " 
 Other notable mentions include : 
 In the poem " Philomela " ( 1853 ) by English poet Matthew Arnold ( 1822 – 1888 ) , the poet asks upon hearing the crying of a fleeing nightingale if it can find peace and healing in the English countryside far away from Greece , although lamenting its pain and passion " eternal . " 
 In his 1881 poem " The Burden of Itys " , Oscar Wilde describes Itys as the symbol of Greek art and pleasure is contrasted with Christ . The landscape of Greece is also compared to the landscape of England , specifically Kent and Oxford . 
 Algernon Charles Swinburne ( 1837 – 1909 ) wrote a poem called " <unk> " based on the story in which Philomela and Procne , after being transformed into the nightingale and swallow , ask when they will be able to forget the grief of having slain <unk> — the answer being they will forget when the world ends . 
 English poet Ann Yearsley ( 1753 – 1806 ) in lamenting the sufferings of African slaves invokes the myth and challenges that her song " shall teach sad Philomel a louder note , " in her abolitionist poem " A Poem on the Inhumanity of the Slave @-@ Trade " ( 1788 ) 
 In " A la Juventud Filipina " , Filipino national hero José Rizal ( 1861 – 1896 ) , used the image of Philomel as inspiration for young Filipinos to use their voices to speak of Spanish injustice and colonial oppression .

 The Philomela myth is perpetuated largely through its appearance as a powerful device in poetry . In the 20th century , American @-@ British poet T. S. Eliot ( 1888 – 1965 ) directly referenced the myth in his most famous poem , " The Waste Land " ( 1922 ) , where he describes , 
 Eliot employs the myth to depict themes of sorrow , pain , and that the only recovery or regeneration possible is through revenge . Several of these mentions reference other poets ' renderings of the myth , including those of Ovid and Gascoigne . Eliot 's references to the nightingales singing by the convent in " Sweeney and the Nightingales " ( 1919 – 1920 ) is a direct reference the murder of Agamemnon in the tragedy by Aeschylus — wherein the Greek dramatist directly evoked the Philomela myth . The poem describes Sweeney as a brute and that two women in the poem are conspiring against him for his mistreatment of them . This mirrors not only the elements of Agamemnon 's death in Aeschylus ' play but the sister 's revenge against Tereus in the myth . 
 In the poem " To the Nightingale " , Argentine poet and fabulist , Jorge Luis Borges ( 1899 – 1986 ) , who compares his efforts as a poet to the bird 's lament though never having heard it . He describes its song as " encrusted with mythology " and that the evolution of the myth has distorted it — that the opinions of other poets and writers have kept both poet and reader from actually hearing the original sound and knowing the essence of the song . 
 Several artists have applied Ovid 's account to new translations or reworkings , or adapted the story for the stage . British poet Ted Hughes ( 1930 – 1998 ) used the myth in his 1997 work Tales from Ovid ( 1997 ) which was a loose translation and retelling of twenty @-@ four tales from Ovid 's Metamorphoses . Both Israeli dramatist <unk> Levin ( in The Great Whore of Babylon ) and English playwright Joanna Laurens ( in The Three Birds ) wrote plays based on the story . Most recently the story was adapted into an opera by Scottish composer James Dillon in 2004 and a 1964 vocal composition by American composer Milton Babbitt with text by John Hollander . 
 Several female writers have used the Philomela myth as a vehicle for exploring the subject of rape , women and power ( empowerment ) , and feminist themes , including novelist Margaret Atwood in her novella Nightingale published in The Tent ( 2006 ) , Emma Tennant in her story " Philomela " , Jeannine Hall Gailey who uses the myth in several poems published in Becoming the <unk> ( 2006 ) , and Timberlake Wertenbaker in her play The Love of the Nightingale ( 1989 ) ( later adapted into an opera of the same name composed by Richard Mills ) .

 Harvey was born on 9 October 1969 in Bridport , Dorset , as the second child of Ray and Eva Harvey , who owned a stone quarrying business , and grew up on the family 's farm in <unk> . During her childhood , she attended school in nearby Beaminster , where she received guitar lessons from folk singer / songwriter Steve Knightley , and her parents introduced her to music that would later influence her work , including blues music , Captain Beefheart and Bob Dylan . 
 As a teenager , Harvey began learning saxophone and joined an eight @-@ piece instrumental group Bologne , based in Dorset . She was also a guitarist with folk duo the <unk> , with whom she wrote some of her earliest material . After finishing school , Harvey attended Yeovil College and attended a visual arts foundation course .

 In July 1988 , Harvey became a member of Automatic Dlamini , a band based in Bristol with whom she gained extensive ensemble @-@ playing experience . Formed by John Parish in 1983 , the band consisted of a rotating line @-@ up that at various times included Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver . Harvey had met Parish in 1987 through mutual friend Jeremy Hogg , the band 's slide guitarist . Providing saxophone , guitars and background vocals , she travelled extensively during the band 's early days , including performances in West Germany , Spain and Poland to support the band 's debut studio album , The D is for Drum . A second European tour took place throughout June and July 1989 . Following the tour , the band recorded Here Catch , <unk> His Father , their second studio album , between late 1989 and early 1990 . This is the only Automatic Dlamini material to feature Harvey , but remains unreleased , although bootleg versions of the album are in circulation . 
 In January 1991 , Harvey left to form her own band with former bandmates Ellis and Oliver ; yet she had formed lasting personal and professional relationships with certain members , especially Parish , whom she has referred to as her " musical soulmate . " Parish would subsequently contribute to , and sometimes co @-@ produce , Harvey 's solo studio albums and has toured with her a number of times . As a duo , Parish and Harvey have recorded two collaborative albums where Parish composed the music and Harvey penned the lyrics . Additionally , Parish 's girlfriend in the late 1980s was photographer Maria Mochnacz . She and Harvey became close friends and Mochnacz went on to shoot and design most of Harvey 's album artwork and music videos , contributing significantly to her public image . 
 Harvey has said of her time with Automatic Dlamini : " I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy to learn how to play the guitar . I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap . I was listening to a lot of Irish folk music at the time , so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff . It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people . " She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences , saying " after the experience with John 's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience , and I probably did learn that from him , amongst other things . " 
 = = = PJ Harvey Trio ; Dry and Rid of Me : 1991 – 1993 = = = 
 In January 1991 , following her departure from Automatic Dlamini , Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver . Harvey decided to name the trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as " nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound " , and also to allow her to continue music as a solo artist . The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars , Ellis on drums and backing vocals , and Oliver on bass . Oliver later departed to rejoin the still @-@ active Automatic Dlamini . He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan . The trio 's " disastrous " debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991 . Harvey later recounted the event saying : " we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there , and during the first song we cleared the hall . There was only about two people left . And a woman came up to us , came up to my drummer , it was only a three piece , while we were playing and shouted at him ' Don 't you realize nobody likes you ! We 'll pay you , you can stop playing , we 'll still pay you ! ' " 
 The band relocated to London in June 1991 when Harvey applied to study sculpture at Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design , still undecided as to her future career . During this time , the band recorded a set of demo recordings and distributed them to record labels . Independent label Too Pure agreed to release the band 's debut single " Dress " in October 1991 , and later signed PJ Harvey . " Dress " received mass critical acclaim upon its release and was voted Single of the Week in Melody Maker by guest reviewer John Peel , who admired " the way Polly Jean seems crushed by the weight of her own songs and arrangements , as if the air is literally being sucked out of them ... admirable if not always enjoyable . " However , Too Pure provided little promotion for the single and critics claim that " Melody Maker had more to do with the success of the " Dress " single than Too Pure Records . " A week after its release , the band recorded a live radio session for Peel on BBC Radio 1 on 29 October featuring " Oh , My Lover , " " Victory , " " Sheela @-@ Na @-@ Gig , " and " Water . " 
 The following February , the trio released " Sheela @-@ Na @-@ Gig " as their equally @-@ acclaimed second single and their debut studio album , Dry ( 1992 ) , followed in March . Like the singles preceding it , Dry received an overwhelming international critical response . The album was cited by Kurt Cobain of Nirvana as his sixteenth favourite album ever in his posthumously @-@ published Journals . Rolling Stone also named Harvey as Songwriter of the Year and Best New Female Singer . A limited edition double LP version of Dry was released alongside the regular version of the album , containing both the original and demo versions of each track , called Dry Demonstration , and the band also received significant coverage at the Reading Festival in 1992 . 
 Island ( PolyGram ) signed the trio amid a major label bidding war in mid @-@ 1992 , and in December 1992 the trio travelled to Cannon Falls , Minnesota in the United States to record the follow @-@ up to Dry with producer Steve Albini . Prior to recording with Albini , the band recorded a second session with John Peel on 22 September and recorded a version of Bob Dylan 's " Highway 61 Revisited , " and two new songs " Me Jane " and " Ecstasy . " The recording sessions with Albini took place at Pachyderm Recording Studio and resulted in the band 's major label debut Rid of Me in May 1993 . Rolling Stone wrote that it " is charged with aggressive eroticism and rock fury . It careens from blues to goth to grunge , often in the space of a single song . " The album was promoted by two singles , " <unk> Queenie " and " Man @-@ Size " , as well as tours of the United Kingdom in May and the United States in June , continuing there during the summer . 
 However , during the American leg of the tour , internal friction started to form between the members of the trio . Deborah Frost , writing for Rolling Stone , noticed " an ever widening personal gulf " between the band members , and quoted Harvey as saying " It makes me sad . I wouldn 't have got here without them . I needed them back then – badly . But I don 't need them anymore . We all changed as people . " Despite the tour 's personal downsides , footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long @-@ form video Reeling with PJ Harvey ( 1993 ) . The band 's final tour was to support U2 in August 1993 , after which the trio officially disbanded . In her final appearance on American television in September 1993 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , Harvey performed a solo version of " Rid of Me . " As Rid of Me sold substantially more copies than Dry , 4 @-@ Track Demos , a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist . In early 1994 , it was announced that U2 's manager , Paul McGuinness , had become her manager .

 As Harvey embarked on her solo career , she explored collaborations with other musicians . In 1995 she released her third studio album , To Bring You My Love , featuring former bandmate John Parish , Bad Seeds multi @-@ instrumentalist Mick Harvey and French drummer Jean @-@ Marc Butty , all of whom would continue to perform and record with Harvey throughout her career . The album was also her first material to be produced by Flood . Simultaneously a more blues @-@ influenced and more futuristic record than its predecessors , To Bring You My Love showcased Harvey broadening her musical style to include strings , organs and synthesisers . Rolling Stone said in its review that " Harvey sings the blues like Nick Cave sings gospel : with more distortion , sex and murder than you remember . To Bring You My Love was a towering goth version of grunge . " During the successive tours for the album , Harvey also experimented with her image and stage persona . 
 The record generated a surprise modern rock radio hit in the United States with its lead single , " Down by the Water . " Three consecutive singles — " C 'mon Billy " , " Send His Love to Me " and " Long Snake Moan " — were also moderately successful . The album was a commercial success selling one million copies worldwide including 370 @,@ 000 in the United States . It was also certified Silver in the United Kingdom within seven months of its release , having sold over 60 @,@ 000 copies . In the United States , the album was voted Album of the Year by The Village Voice , Rolling Stone , USA Today , People , The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times . Rolling Stone also named Harvey 1995 's Artist of the Year and Spin ranked the album third in The 90 Greatest Albums of the ' 90s , behind Nirvana 's Nevermind ( 1991 ) and Public Enemy 's Fear of a Black Planet ( 1990 ) . 
 In 1996 , following the international success of To Bring You My Love and other collaborations , Harvey began composing material that would end up on her fourth studio album , during what she referred to as " an incredibly low patch . " The material diverged significantly from her former work and introduced electronica elements into her song @-@ writing . During recording sessions in 1997 original PJ Harvey Trio drummer Rob Ellis rejoined Harvey 's band , and Flood was hired again as producer . The sessions , which continued into April the following year , resulted in Is This Desire ? ( 1998 ) . Though originally released to mixed reviews in September 1998 , the album was a success and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Performance . The album 's lead single , " A Perfect Day Elise , " was moderately successful in the United Kingdom , peaking at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart , her most successful single to date .

 In early 2000 Harvey began work on her fifth studio album Stories from the City , Stories from the Sea with Rob Ellis and Mick Harvey . Written in her native Dorset , Paris and New York , the album showcased a more mainstream indie rock and pop rock sound to her previous albums and the lyrics followed themes of love that tied into Harvey 's affection for New York City . The album also featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on three tracks , including his lead vocals on " This Mess We 're in . " Upon its release in October 2000 the album was a critical and commercial success , selling over one million copies worldwide and charting in both the United Kingdom and the United States . The album 's three singles — " Good Fortune " , " A Place Called Home " and " This Is Love " — were moderately successful . 
 The album also received a number of accolades including a BRIT Award nomination for Best Female Artist and two Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Performance for the album 's third single , " This Is Love " . However , most notably , Harvey was nominated for , and won , the 2001 Mercury Music Prize . The awards ceremony was held on the same day as the 11 September attacks on the United States and Harvey was on tour in Washington , D.C. , one of the affected cities , when she won the prize . Reflecting on the win in 2011 , she said : " quite naturally I look back at that and only remember the events that were taking place across the world and to win the prize on that day — it didn 't have much importance in the grand scheme of things " , noting " it was a very surreal day " . The same year , Harvey also topped a readers ' poll conducted by Q Magazine of the 100 Greatest Women in Rock Music . 
 During three years of various collaborations with other artists , Harvey was also working on her sixth studio album , Uh Huh Her , which was released in May 2004 . For the first time since 4 @-@ Track Demos ( 1993 ) , Harvey played every instrument — with the exception of drums provided by Rob Ellis — and was the sole producer . The album received " generally favourable reviews " by critics , though its production was often criticised . It was also a commercial success , debuting and peaking at number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and being certified Silver by the BPI within a month of its release . 
 Harvey also did an extensive world tour in promotion of the album , lasting seven months in total . For the tour , she formed a backing band consisting of Rob Ellis , bassist Dingo and future Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer and performed at various European summer festivals , including Glastonbury , as well as opening two shows for Morrissey . Selected recordings from the tour were included on Harvey 's first live DVD , On Tour : Please Leave Quietly , directed by Maria Mochnacz and released in 2006 .

 During her first performance since the Uh Huh Her tour at the Hay Festival of Literature & Arts on 26 May 2006 , Harvey revealed that her next studio album would be almost entirely piano @-@ based . Following the October release of The Peel Sessions 1991 – 2004 , a compilation of songs recorded from 1991 to 2000 during her radio sessions with John Peel , she began recording her seventh studio album White Chalk in November , together with Flood , John Parish , and Eric Drew Feldman in a studio in West London . White Chalk was released in September 2007 and marked a radical departure from her usual alternative rock style , consisting mainly of piano ballads . The album received favourable reviews , its style being described by one critic as containing " pseudo @-@ Victorian elements — drama , restraint , and antiquated instruments and sounds . " Harvey herself said of the album : " when I listen to the record I feel in a different universe , really , and I 'm not sure whether it 's in the past or in the future . The record confuses me , that 's what I like — it doesn 't feel of this time right now , but I 'm not sure whether it 's 100 years ago or 100 years in the future " , summing up the album 's sound as " really weird . " During the tour for the album Harvey performed without a backing band , and also began performing on an autoharp , which continues to be her primary instrument after guitar and has influenced her material since White Chalk . 
 In April 2010 , Harvey appeared on The Jools Holland Show to perform a new song titled " Let England Shake . " In a pre @-@ performance interview with Marr , she stated that the new material she had written had been " formed out of the landscape that I 've grown up in and the history of this nation " and as " a human being affected by politics . " Her eighth studio album Let England Shake was released in February 2011 , and received universal critical acclaim from critics . NME 's 10 / 10 review summarised the album as " a record that ventures deep into the heart of darkness of war itself and its resonance throughout England 's past , present and future " and other reviews also noted its themes and writing style as " bloody and forceful , " mixing " ethereal form with brutal content , " and " her most powerful . " Dealing with the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and other episodes from English history , the album featured John Parish , Mick Harvey and Jean @-@ Marc Butty as Harvey 's backing band and the quartet toured extensively in its promotion . Following the release of the album 's two well @-@ received singles — " The Words That <unk> Murder " and " The Glorious Land " — and the collection of short films by Seamus Murphy to accompany the album , Harvey won her second Mercury Music Prize on 6 September . The award marked her as the first artist to receive the award twice , entering her into The Guinness Book Of Records as the only artist to have achieved this . , and sales of Let England Shake increased 1 @,@ 190 % overnight following her win . On 23 September , Let England Shake was certified Gold in the United Kingdom and was listed as album of the year by MOJO and Uncut . 
 On 3 August 2013 Harvey released a song Shaker Aamer in support of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp detainee by the same name who was the last British citizen to be held there . The song describes in detail what Aamer endured during his four @-@ month hunger strike .

The album also listed her as Polly Jean Harvey , which in part affected the album 's sales . Harvey has also reflected on how the album was " an enormous turning point " and " lyrically , it moved me into areas I 'd never been to before . " In 1998 , she also performed lead vocals on " Airplane Blues , " as a soundtrack accompaniment to the <unk> art exhibition by Rebecca Goddard and Parish 's wife , Michelle Henning , which was released as the closing song on Parish 's second solo album How Animals Move in 2002 . Following the release of White Chalk , Harvey reunited with Parish to record A Woman a Man Walked By , released in March 2009 . Like Dance Hall at Louse Point , the album received positive reviews but also was a moderate commercial success , peaking at number 25 in the UK Albums Chart . 
 Aside from collaborations , Harvey has also embarked on a number of projects as a composer . In January 2009 , a new stage production of Henrik Ibsen 's Hedda Gabler opened on Broadway . Directed by Ian Rickson and starring Mary @-@ Louise Parker in the title role , the play featured an original score of incidental music written by Harvey . In November 2011 , Harvey also composed part of the score for the Young Vic 's long @-@ running production of Hamlet in London . In May 2012 , Harvey composed two songs , " Horse " and " Bobby Don 't Steal , " for Mark Cousins ' film What is This Film Called Love ? , which also features " To Bring You My Love . "

 Harvey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range . Harvey dislikes repeating herself in her music , resulting in very different @-@ sounding albums . In an October 2004 interview with Rolling Stone , she said : " when I 'm working on a new record , the most important thing is to not repeat myself ... that 's always my aim : to try and cover new ground and really to challenge myself . Because I 'm in this for learning . " While her musical style has been described as alternative rock , punk blues , art rock , and avant @-@ rock , she has experimented with various other genres including electronica , indie rock and folk music . 
 She is also known for changing her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle , creating a unique aesthetic that extends to all aspects of the album , from the album art to the live performances . She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album . Around the time of To Bring You My Love , for example , Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances . Her former fashion style , which consisted of simple black leggings , turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots , was replaced by ballgowns , catsuits , wigs and excessive make @-@ up . She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust @-@ style flashlight microphone . She denied the influence of drag , Kabuki or performance art on her new image , a look she affectionately dubbed " Joan Crawford on acid " in an interview with Spin in 1996 , but admitted that " it 's that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting , all at the same time , that appeals to me . I actually find wearing make @-@ up like that , sort of smeared around , as extremely beautiful . Maybe that 's just my twisted sense of beauty . " However , she later told Dazed & Confused magazine , " that was kind of a mask . It was much more of a mask than I 've ever had . I was very lost as a person , at that point . I had no sense of self left at all " , and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the To Bring You My Love tour . 
 At an early age , she was introduced by her parents to blues music , jazz and art rock , which , she told Rolling Stone in 1995 , would later influence her : " I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker , to Howlin ' Wolf , to Robert Johnson , and a lot of Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart . So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age , and that 's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older . I think the way we are as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children . " During her teenage years , she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell , Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet , although later stated that it was a phase when she was " having a bit of a rebellion against my parents ' record collection . " In her later teenage years , she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies , Television and Slint ( whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying " interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd . , Louisville , KY <unk> " ) . Though not as many critics have suspected , Patti Smith ; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as " lazy journalism . " However , recently Harvey has said that Smith is " so energising to see and so passionate with what she 's doing " . Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance , stating : " She is so exciting to watch , so full of energy and human raw quality " . She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music , Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone , classical composers like Arvo Pärt , Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki ; and Neil Young . As a lyricist , Harvey has cited numerous poets , authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter , T. S. Eliot , William Butler Yeats , James Joyce , Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth .

 Outside her better @-@ known music career , Harvey is also an occasional artist and actress . In 1998 she appeared in Hal Hartley 's film The Book of Life as Magdalena — a modern @-@ day character based on the Biblical Mary Magdalene — and had a cameo role as a Playboy Bunny in A Bunny Girl 's Tale , a short film directed by Sarah Miles , in which she also performs " Nina in Ecstasy " , an outtake from Is This Desire ? ( 1998 ) . Harvey also collaborated with Miles on another film , <unk> Fallout 1972 , which includes Harvey performing a cover of " When Will I See You Again . " 
 Harvey is also an accomplished sculptor who has had several pieces exhibited at the Lamont Gallery and the Bridport Arts Centre . In 2010 , she was invited to be the guest designer for the summer issue of Francis Ford Coppola 's literary magazine Zoetrope : All @-@ Story . The issue featured Harvey 's paintings and drawings alongside short stories by Woody Allen . Speaking of her artistic contributions to the magazine in 2011 , Harvey said : " the first opportunity I ever had to show any work was in this magazine . They were drawn while I was writing and recording the record ( Let England Shake ) . It does relate to the record in the way the cycle keeps happening . " 
 In December 2013 , Harvey gave her debut public poetry reading at the British Library . On 2 January 2014 PJ Harvey guest @-@ edited BBC Radio 4 's Today programme . 
 In October 2015 , PJ Harvey published her first collection of poetry , a collaboration with photographer Seamus Murphy , entitled The Hollow of The Hand . To create the book , PJ Harvey and Seamus Murphy made several journeys to Kosovo , Afghanistan , and Washington DC . Seamus Murphy had previously worked with PJ Harvey to create 12 Short Films for Let England Shake .

 Harvey has acquired a reputation for eccentricity to match her music ; for example , Steve Albini said she ate nothing but potatoes while making Rid of Me . But she rejects the notion that her song lyrics are autobiographical , telling The Times in 1998 : " the tortured artist myth is rampant . People paint me as some kind of black witchcraft @-@ practising devil from hell , that I have to be twisted and dark to do what I am doing . It 's a load of rubbish " . Similarly , she later told Spin : " some critics have taken my writing so literally to the point that they 'll listen to ' Down by the Water ' and believe I have actually given birth to a child and drowned her . " 
 In the early 1990s , Harvey was romantically involved with drummer and photographer Joe Dilworth . From 1996 to 1997 , following their musical collaborations , Harvey had a relationship with Nick Cave , and their subsequent break @-@ up influenced Cave 's follow @-@ up studio album The Boatman 's Call ( 1997 ) , with songs such as " Into My Arms , " " West Country Girl " and " Black Hair " being written specifically about her . 
 Harvey has one older brother , Saul , and four nephews through him . She said in 1995 that she would love to have children , stating : " I wouldn 't consider it unless I was married . I would have to meet someone that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with . That 's the only person who I would want to be the father of my children . Maybe that will never happen . I obviously see it in a very rational way but I 'd love to have children . "
