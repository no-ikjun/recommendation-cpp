 = = = Probability and measure theory = = = 
 Convex sets are often studied with probability theory . Each point in the convex hull of a ( non @-@ empty ) subset Q of a finite @-@ dimensional space is the expected value of a simple random vector that takes its values in Q , as a consequence of Carathéodory 's lemma . Thus , for a non @-@ empty set Q , the collection of the expected values of the simple , Q @-@ valued random vectors equals Q 's convex hull ; this equality implies that the Shapley – Folkman – Starr results are useful in probability theory . In the other direction , probability theory provides tools to examine convex sets generally and the Shapley – Folkman – Starr results specifically . The Shapley – Folkman – Starr results have been widely used in the probabilistic theory of random sets , for example , to prove a law of large numbers , a central limit theorem , and a large @-@ deviations principle . These proofs of probabilistic limit theorems used the Shapley – Folkman – Starr results to avoid the assumption that all the random sets be convex . 
 A probability measure is a finite measure , and the Shapley – Folkman lemma has applications in non @-@ probabilistic measure theory , such as the theories of volume and of vector measures . The Shapley – Folkman lemma enables a refinement of the Brunn – Minkowski inequality , which bounds the volume of sums in terms of the volumes of their summand @-@ sets . The volume of a set is defined in terms of the Lebesgue measure , which is defined on subsets of Euclidean space . In advanced measure @-@ theory , the Shapley – Folkman lemma has been used to prove Lyapunov 's theorem , which states that the range of a vector measure is convex . Here , the traditional term " range " ( alternatively , " image " ) is the set of values produced by the function . A vector measure is a vector @-@ valued generalization of a measure ; for example , if p1 and p2 are probability measures defined on the same measurable space , then the product function p1 p2 is a vector measure , where p1 p2 is defined for every event ω by 
 ( p1 p2 ) ( ω ) = ( p1 ( ω ) , p2 ( ω ) ) . 
 Lyapunov 's theorem has been used in economics , in ( " bang @-@ bang " ) control theory , and in statistical theory . Lyapunov 's theorem has been called a continuous counterpart of the Shapley – Folkman lemma , which has itself been called a discrete analogue of Lyapunov 's theorem . 
 = Kerry slug = 
 The Kerry slug or Kerry spotted slug , scientific name Geomalacus maculosus , is a rare species of medium @-@ sized to large air @-@ breathing land slug . It is a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc in the family Arionidae , the <unk> slugs . 
 An adult Kerry slug generally measures 7 – 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 2 in ) in length and is dark grey or brownish in colour , with yellowish spots . The internal anatomy of the slug shows some unusual features , and some characteristic differences from the genus Arion , which is the type genus of the family Arionidae . The Kerry slug was described in 1843 , rather late compared to many other relatively large land gastropods that form a part of the fauna of the British Isles ; this is one indication of this slug 's rarity and its secretive habits . 
 Although the distribution of this slug species does include some wild habitats in southwestern Ireland ( e.g. in County Kerry ) , the species is more widespread in north @-@ west Spain and from central to northern Portugal . However , it is not found anywhere between Ireland and Spain . The species appears to require environments that have high humidity and acidic soil ( soil with no calcium carbonate in it ) . The slug is mostly nocturnal or crepuscular , although in Ireland it is active on overcast days . It feeds on lichens , liverworts , mosses and fungi , which grow either on boulders or on tree trunks . 
 This rare species is officially protected by conservation laws in each of the three countries in which it occurs . However , the survival of the Kerry slug is nonetheless threatened because it lives only in completely wild , unspoiled habitat of a particular type : acidic woodlands and moorlands that support the species of lower plants on which the slug relies for food . This habitat type is itself at risk from a number of different factors , ranging from climate change to the construction of roads . Attempts have been made to establish breeding populations in captivity , to help ensure the survival of this slug species , but with only limited success . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Kerry slug is a gastropod , as are all other snails and slugs , including slugs and snails that live in saltwater , those that live in freshwater , and those that live on the land . This is a land slug which breathes air , a pulmonate . It is in the clade Stylommatophora , which means that its primitive eyes or eye spots are carried on the tips of its two upper tentacles . Despite superficial similarities , not all land slugs are in the same family or superfamily . The Kerry slug is an <unk> , or round @-@ backed slug ; it has no keel on its back , in contrast to the land slugs in the family <unk> and <unk> . It also shares numerous internal anatomical features with slug species in other genera within the family Arionidae , including the Arion slugs , which are most typical of the family . 
 The Kerry slug 's scientific name or binomial name is Geomalacus maculosus . It is in the genus Geomalacus , a name which literally means " earth mollusc " . Its specific name maculosus means " spotted " , from the Latin word macula " spot " . The English language vernacular name ( or common name ) is derived from the name of County Kerry , which is the county in the southwest of Ireland where this species was first collected , and which is also the type locality , as mentioned in the original description . 
 The scientific name of the species is also sometimes written as Geomalacus ( Geomalacus ) maculosus . This is because the genus Geomalacus contains two subgenera : the nominate subgenus ( subgenus of the same name ) Geomalacus and a second subgenus <unk> <unk> , 1890 . The subgenus Geomalacus contains only one species , the Kerry slug . The subgenus <unk> includes three species . 
 This slug species was originally described and named from specimens collected in Ireland . In 1842 , an Irish naturalist named William Andrews ( 1802 – 1880 ) sent material that he had found at Caragh Lake in County Kerry to the Irish naturalist George James Allman , who then introduced the slug to science as a new species . 
 The Kerry slug has been included in molecular phylogenetic studies since 2001 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The body length of adult slugs of this species is 7 – 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 2 in ) . However it is difficult to measure these slugs accurately because of their unusual startle response ( see the section entitled behaviour ) . Kerry slugs can also elongate themselves within crevices up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 8 in ) . " Official " measurements of this species vary ; for example , <unk> et al . ( 1983 ) give a range of measurements for the species : 6 – 9 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 6 in ) . The body of a fixed ( preserved ) adult specimen was 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) long with a mantle length of 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) . 
 The body of these slugs is glossy , and is covered on the left and right sides with about 25 longitudinal rows of polygonal <unk> ( very small knobs with outlines like polygons ) . These slugs are usually blackish or dark @-@ grey in colour , sometimes with indistinct darker bands . On each side of the body there can be two bands : one band just below the summit of the back , and the other band further down the side of the body . When these bands are present they usually extend the whole length of the body of the slug , and are overspread by numerous , somewhat oval , yellowish spots . These yellow spots are distributed more or less in five longitudinal zones . 
 Behind the animal 's head , the " shield " ( the shield @-@ shaped outer surface of the mantle ) is about a third of the length of the body when the slug is actively crawling and thus extended , but only about half of that when the slug is motionless and contracted . The shield is rounded in front , and bluntly pointed behind . The texture of the surface of this area resembles the underside of undyed leather . It is spotted with pale buff or whitish spots which are similar to those on the body , but more uniformly distributed . 
 The foot @-@ fringe ( a band of tissue around the edge of the foot ) is not very distinctly separated : it is very pale and somewhat expanded , with indistinct lines on it . The sole ( the underside ) of the foot is a pale grayish @-@ yellow in colour , and is divided into three indistinct bands , with the mid @-@ area being somewhat darker and more transparent than the side bands . There is a caudal mucous pit situated between the foot and the body on the upper surface of the tip of the tail . The pit ( which collects extra mucus ) is not very conspicuous , but it is triangular in shape and opens transversely ( i.e. from side to side ) . The mucous pit often carries a transparent yellowish ball of slime ( mucus ) . 
 The upper tentacles are smoky @-@ black or grey , short and thick , with oval ends , and have the usual eye spots at their tips . The genital pore ( or opening ) lies behind and below the right eye @-@ tentacle . The lower tentacles are pale translucent grey . The skin mucus is usually pale yellow , and varies in its degree of viscosity ( stickiness ) . The locomotory @-@ mucus ( mucus for crawling on ) is tenacious and usually colourless , but it can be yellowish because of having mixed with the body slime . 
 = = = Internal anatomy = = = 
 = = = = Shell = = = = 
 Most land slugs have , within the mantle , the remnants or residue of what was , in the evolutionary past , a larger external shell . In most slugs , this remnant takes the form either of a small internal shell ( a thin shelly plate ) , or a collection of calcareous ( chalky ) granules . In this species there is an internal shell or shell plate which resembles that found in land slugs of the genus <unk> . In other words , the shell plate in this species is oval in shape , solid , and chalky , with a transparent conchiolin ( horny ) base . The shell plate is usually somewhat convex above and concave beneath , with a few indistinct concentric lines of growth , and is covered outwardly with a very thin transparent periostracum ( a protein layer ) , and with the nucleus ( the oldest growth part ) situated near the front . In young Kerry slugs the shell is very thin and convex , abruptly cut off behind , and with an extremely thin layer that projects in front and contains minute granules . 
 The shell plate has been drawn differently by authors , but do at least show that it is a solid plate : 
 = = = = Various organ systems = = = = 
 The circulatory and excretory system are closely related , in that the heart is surrounded by the triangular kidney . The kidney has a <unk> ( layered ) structure and it has two ureters . In this slug species , the ventricle of the heart is directed towards , and is very close to , the anal and respiratory openings . The ventricle of the heart is further away and further back than it is in species of the related genus Arion , the type genus of the family Arionidae . 
 The gland above the foot , the <unk> gland , is deeply imbedded in the tissues , and reaches far back . The cephalic ( head ) gland known as the Semper 's organ is well developed , and shows as a pair of strong flattened lobes . The salivary and digestive glands are the same as those found in Arion species , but the vestigial osphradium ( kidney @-@ like structure ) within the mantle chamber is more distinct than it is in Arion species . 
 = = = = Muscles = = = = 
 As for the various muscles within the slug , the cephalic <unk> ( muscles for pulling in the head ) are very much the same as they are in Arion species . The right and left tentacular muscles , which pull in all four of the tentacles , divide early for the upper and lower tentacles , but only the muscles of the ommatophores ( the muscles of the two upper tentacles , which have eye spots ) are darkly pigmented . The right and left muscles that pull in the eyespot tentacles are attached at the base to the back edge of the mantle , on the right and left respectively . The pharyngeal ( throat ) retractor muscle is , as usual , <unk> ( split ) for attachment to the back of the buccal bulb ( mouth bulb ) , and the root of this muscle is fixed on the right side of the body , just behind where the right tentacular muscle is attached . 
 = = = = Reproductive system = = = = 
 Kerry slug is hermaphrodite as all other <unk> . Its reproductive system is diagnostic feature . The genus Geomalacus has a special feature : the atrium has a diverticulum . This atrial diverticulum is an elongated part of the atrium . The penis in the genus Geomalacus is reduced and lost as well its penial retractor muscle . The atrial diverticulum is a secondary penial structure and with its spermatheca retractor muscle acts as a copulatory organ instead . The other end of the spermatheca retractor muscle extends to the posterior end of the body . The atrial diverticulum has been proposed to be the morphological equivalent ( analogy , <unk> ) of a penis . 
 Geomalacus maculosus has an atrial diverticulum longer than the spermatheca duct , while Geomalacus <unk> has an atrial diverticulum shorter than the spermatheca duct . 
 Various authors have depicted the reproductive system of Kerry slug : Godwin @-@ Austen ( 1882 ) , <unk> ( 1891 ) , <unk> ( 1891 , 1894 ) , Taylor ( 1907 ) , Germain ( 1930 ) , Quick ( 1960 ) and Platts & Speight ( 1988 ) . Platts & Speight ( 1988 ) consider from previous authors depiction by Godwin @-@ Austen ( 1882 ) to be the most accurate , because other authors depicted atrium too short . 
 The Kerry slug 's reproductive organs are as follows : there is a small , compact , and darkly pigmented <unk> ( a combination of ovary and testis ) . There is a hermaphroditic duct ( male and female duct ) which is very long and greatly convoluted , and ends in a small spherical <unk> <unk> ( seminal vesicle ) . The albumen gland ( which creates albumen for the eggs ) is elongated and shaped like a tongue . The <unk> ( a duct that carries both eggs and sperm ) is very much twisted . The free oviduct ( duct that carries eggs only ) is rather long and thin , but without any enlargement . 
 The vas deferens ( carries sperm ) is very long , complexly twisted , and rolled up in the form of a bundle . The spermatheca ( for storing sperm ) is globular , with a short stem , but is quite distant from the genital pore ( where the whole elaborate system opens to the outside world ) . The spermatheca is distant from this opening because of the remarkable elongation of the atrium or vestibule ( a common area which is usually just inside the genital pore , the atrium is an area where both the male and the female systems open ) . There is a long retractor muscle from the vesicle , and its stem is fixed internally to the back of the slug in the median line ( midline of the body ) near the caudal end ( tail end ) of the body . The vas deferens and the spermatheca open nearly together into the far extremity of the atrium , which is prolonged in an attenuate form ( drawn out in length ) to an enormous extent . The very thin free oviduct ( egg @-@ carrying duct ) opens into the atrium much nearer the near end , where the muscular vestibule is greatly but irregularly enlarged , and connected to the oviduct by a number of muscular fibres . 
 Within the vagina ( the female organ which receives the copulatory organ during copulation ) there is a curious series of flattened folds , the central part has a pointed end which is situated close to the genital pore , and this pointed end may possibly be a <unk> ( a very much reduced version of an organ that makes love darts ) and thus may be the homologue ( a similar structure because of shared ancestry ) of the love dart in the Helicidae . 
 = = = = Apparatus for feeding = = = = 
 = = = = = Radula = = = = = 
 The radula is a feeding structure found only in molluscs . Typically it is a small but strong ribbon @-@ like structure with numerous complex rows of tiny teeth across it . The radula is situated inside the mouth . 
 In this species of slug , the radula is 8 mm ( 5 / 16 in ) long and 2 mm ( 1 / 16 in ) wide , and has 240 slightly curved transverse ( crosswise ) rows of denticles ( tiny teeth ) . Each row of teeth is composed of one median tooth and 10 lateral and marginal teeth on each side . The median teeth are small , and are clearly <unk> ( having one cusp ) , though they are slightly shouldered . The lateral teeth are bicuspid ( having two cusps ) but the <unk> ( next to the middle ) teeth are noticeably larger than the median row , and the <unk> ( an extra protrusion in the middle of the tooth ) is well developed . There is however , no distinction between the lateral and marginal series except that the <unk> ( extra little side protrusion ) present on the <unk> teeth recedes in position and slightly diminishes in size in the succeeding teeth up to about the twentieth row on the radula , but in the marginal series , the <unk> gradually grows in size and importance as the margin is approached , while the <unk> becomes almost correspondingly diminished , the outermost teeth showing a more embryonic ( more like that of an embryo ) character . 
 = = = = = Jaw = = = = = 
 The jaw measures about 1 mm ( 1 / 32 in ) from side to side , and is distinctly arcuate ( arched ) from front to rear , lunate ( crescent @-@ moon shaped ) in shape , but very wide , with broad and slightly rounded ends . The jaw is solid , dark @-@ brown and has about 10 broad flat ribs only in the middle part of the jaw . These ribs are absent or scarcely discernible on the side areas . Where the ribs meet the upper edge they sometimes form crenulations ( a scalloped effect ) and may also produce the same effect on the lower edge of the jaw . In other individuals the ribs extend all the way across the jaw , making both the upper and the cutting edges of the jaw clearly <unk> ( noticeably toothed in outline ) . 
 The alimentary canal of the digestive system forms two loops , as is true of all species within the family Arionidae . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Geomalacus maculosus has what is known as a disjunct distribution ( in other words , it occurs in discontinuous locations ) . This slug is found only in southwestern Ireland , north @-@ west Spain , and from central Portugal to northern Portugal . The presence of this slug in southwest Ireland might seem anomalous , but similar distribution patterns have been observed in a few other species of animals and plants . This particular disjunct distribution ( in Iberia and in Ireland without any intermediate localities ) is known as " Lusitanian " . 
 There has been speculation that the G. maculosus was introduced to Ireland from Iberia by prehistoric humans , as appears to have happened in the case of the Eurasian Pygmy Shrew . In support of this , the genetic diversity of the slug in Ireland was found to be greatly reduced compared with the Iberian populations . 
 = = = Ireland = = = 
 Within Ireland , this species of slug is known from areas with sandstone geology in West Cork and County Kerry , a total area of around 5 @,@ 800 km2 ( 2 @,@ 200 sq mi ) . In 2010 , a previously unknown population of the Kerry Slug was recorded in a third county , Co . Galway . 
 = = = = Protected sites = = = = 
 A significant proportion of the Kerry slug 's range in Ireland is protected by being included in Special Areas of Conservation ( SACs ) . Ireland 's response to the European environmental legislation concerning the slug is discussed in greater detail in the Conservation Measures section below . 
 A total of seven Special Areas of Conservation have been designated with the slug as a " selection feature " : 
 <unk> Harbour and Woodland 
 Caha Mountains 
 Sheep 's Head 
 Killarney National Park , Macgillycuddy 's Reeks and Caragh River Catchment 
 Lough <unk> and Lough <unk> 
 <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> Wood 
 Blackwater River ( Kerry ) . 
 In addition , St. <unk> 's Wood SAC ( which was designated in relation to other selection criteria ) was expanded in 2008 to protect Cascade Wood , a small area of woodland which is inhabited by the slug . 
 The species has also been recorded at other SACs where it is not a selection feature , for example <unk> Bog in County Cork . 
 = = = Iberia : Spain and Portugal = = = 
 Despite its first " discovery " at Caragh Lake , and its English common name of " Kerry slug " , Ireland is not at the centre of this slug species ' distribution ; instead the distribution of this slug is centred in continental Iberia . This slug has been known from northern Spain since 1868 , and from northern Portugal since 1873 . It was once reported as occurring in France , but this was never confirmed , and so that record is considered suspect .

 The distribution of this species in Spain includes coastal locations in Galicia , and extends through the Cantabrian Mountains as far east as Mount <unk> in the Basque Country . The localities in question fall within the boundaries of various autonomous communities : Galicia , Asturias , Cantabria , Castile and León ( provinces of León , Palencia and Zamora ) , and the Basque Country ( provinces of Biscay and Álava ) .

 Picos de Europa - This mountain range is divided between three autonomous communities . The three sites listed ( Picos de Europa , Picos de Europa ( Asturias ) , Picos de Europa en Castilla y León ) include protected areas in the Picos de Europa National Park , and a regional park in Castile and Leon which is also called Picos de Europa . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 This species of slug is primarily nocturnal , in other words it is usually only active at night . During the daylight hours , these slugs are usually hidden in crevices of rocks and under loose bark on trees . In Iberia , juvenile slugs of this species become active during twilight , and adults become active at night , especially on rainy or very humid nights . Ireland however is much further north , so the temperatures there are considerably cooler , there is more rain , and the air is often quite damp ; in Ireland this slug is sometimes active in the daytime as long as the weather is humid and overcast . 
 The Kerry slug has a defensive behavior that is very unusual in slugs . When attacked , most land slugs will simply retract the head and contract the body , but stay firmly attached to the substrate . In contrast , when this slug is threatened , it retracts its head , lets go of the substrate , rolls up completely , and stays contracted in a ball @-@ like shape . This is a unique feature among all the Arionidae , and among all slugs in Ireland . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Habitat = = = 
 Geomalacus maculosus lives only in wild habitats and thus it is never an agricultural pest , unlike some other slugs in the family Arionidae . 
 In Ireland this slug inhabits wild woodland with oak trees , and oligotrophic open moorlands , as long as there are boulders covered with lichens and mosses in these habitats . In Spain it usually occurs in granite mountains . 
 The Kerry slug usually prefers acidic soil and high humidity environments , living on moss and lichen @-@ covered rocks and trees ( mainly the chestnut Castanea sativa and some species of oak ) , under fallen wood and under bark of rotten wood . It may also occur in open areas , such as hydrophilic pastures near oligotrophic water bodies . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The food of Geomalacus maculosus includes lichens , liverworts , mosses , fungi ( Fistulina hepatica ) and bacteria that grow on boulders and on tree trunks . 
 In captivity , this species has been fed on porridge , bread , dandelion leaves , lichen Cladonia fimbriata and various vegetables : ( carrot , cabbage , cucumber , lettuce ) . It can be also carnivorous in captivity , and has been documented as devouring the snail <unk> pellucida . 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 The mating of this species is in head @-@ to @-@ head position with genital openings facing each other . Atria are shaped as a funnel with fluted edges after mating . As in Arion , sperm is transferred in a spermatophore . Eggs are laid in July to October in the wild , and from February to October in captivity . Self @-@ fertilisation is also possible in this species . The eggs are laid in clusters of 18 to 30 , and held together by a film of mucus . The egg masses are about 3 @.@ 5 × 2 cm in overall size . 
 The eggs are very large compared with the size of the animal , but vary within certain limits . The largest eggs are more elongate , being 8 @.@ 5 × 4 @.@ 25 mm ; the smallest eggs are more regularly oval , and are only 6 × 3 mm . All are semitranslucent milky @-@ white or opalescent when fresh , although some of the larger and more elongate ones show a somewhat transparent area at the smaller end . The opalescent ( the color changes with the light direction like an opal ) lustre becomes lost in a few days , and the eggs turn yellowish , and later brown , or black . 
 The young appear to hatch in from 6 to 8 weeks , at which period the spots on the body of the animal are barely present . However , the lateral bands are distinct and black , much more conspicuous than they are in mature slugs of this species . In juveniles the shield shows lyre @-@ shaped markings , as is the case in slugs of the genus Arion . However these lyre @-@ shaped markings become indistinct as the slugs grow larger . The slugs probably pass the winter in the sexually immature stage . The body of preserved juvenile specimens is up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) long with a mantle length of 10 mm . Juveniles reach maturity in 2 years , at a length about 2 @.@ 6 cm . The life span of Geomalacus maculosus in the wild is up to seven years , but the lifespan in captivity is rarely over three years . In numerous different localities in Spain , it was consistently found to be the case that no more than a very few individuals of the species were observed at any one time . 
 There were not known natural enemies of Geomalacus maculosus up to 2014 . Predators of Geomalacus maculosus include larvae of the third instar of the fly <unk> elata . 
 = = Threats to the survival of the species = = 
 The most serious threat to the species is probably modification of the habitat , which reduces its lichen and moss food sources . This can lead to the local disappearance of the species , which was documented in Spain . Other threats include : intensification of land use ( land reclamation , using of pesticides , overgrazing by sheep , removing of shrubs , building gardens , burning , and building roads and highways ) , tourism , general development pressure , coniferous forest plantations , the spread of invasive species of plants such as Rhododendron ponticum and habitat fragmentation ( see also <unk> 2006 ) . 
 Other potential dangers to the species include climate change and air pollution , because these negatively affect the lichens which are a food source for the slug . Climate change will probably affect the Iberian populations more seriously , because the climate there is already on the hot and dry side relative to Ireland , which is generally rather cool and damp .

 = = = International protection = = = 
 Because of its perceived rarity and its restricted distribution , Geomalacus maculosus is protected under the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats ( Bern Convention ) , EIS Bern Invertebrates Project . This decision was backed by studies of its distribution and ecology in Ireland which concluded that evidence of a decline in Iberia , plus uncertainty over its status in Ireland , tended to support its inclusion in the Convention . Since 2006 , Geomalacus maculosus has been considered a least concern species in the IUCN Red List , however , during 1994 to 2006 the slug was rated as vulnerable . 
 Geomalacus maculosus is also protected by the European Union 's Habitats Directive ( which was a response to the Bern Convention ) and has been listed as an Annex II and Annex IV species since 1992 . There are two principal mechanisms used by the Directive to protect habitats and species – the creation of Special Areas of Conservation ( SACs ) and the protection of species independently of their habitats by other means . It is probably in areas not specifically protected as SACs that threats to the Kerry slug will be greatest . Seven SACs have been designated for this species in Ireland and 49 SCIs in Spain . The Habitats Directive protects the Kerry slug outside the SACs by Article 12 ( 1 ) , which obliges European Union member states to : 
 establish ‘ a system of strict protection ’ for listed species 
 prohibit deliberate capture or killing 
 prohibit ‘ deliberate disturbance … particularly during the period of breeding , rearing , hibernation and migration ’ 
 prohibit ‘ deliberate destruction or taking of eggs from the wild ’ 
 prohibit the deliberate or non @-@ deliberate ‘ deterioration or destruction of breeding sites or resting places ’ .

 = = = Protection in Ireland = = = 
 In 1988 Platts and Speight noted that only three of the Irish sites where the slug occurred were protected : <unk> Forest , West Cork ; <unk> Wood Nature Reserve , South Kerry ; and Killarney National Park , North Kerry . They concluded that the species could not be adequately safeguarded with only three sites , and therefore they supported its inclusion in the Bern list , to which the Irish government is a signatory . 
 The Habitats Directive was transposed into Irish law by : 
 The EC ( Natural Habitats ) Regulations 1997 . This was the principal legislation transposing the Habitats Directive and upgraded the protection of the Kerry slug 's habitat by the designation of Special Areas of Conservation ( as listed in the distribution section above ) . 
 Adapting existing legislation . The Kerry slug has been protected since 1990 under the Irish Wildlife Act of 1976 ; it was added to the list of protected species by Statutory Instrument 112 / 1990 , and was the only gastropod so protected . The treatment of the Kerry Slug has been cited in the media as an example of hyper @-@ protectionism . However , The Wildlife Act does not protect the slug from authorised or unauthorised indirect damage , but only from wilful direct damage such as collecting . 
 The Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service published a Species Action Plan for the Kerry slug in January 2008 . Efforts were made to protect the slug from indirect damage arising , for example , from commercial forestry . However , following a legal challenge to Ireland 's transposition and implementation of the Habitats Directive , the Action Plan was superseded in May 2010 by a Threat Response Plan . The Threat Response Plan addressed issues which arose when the European Court of Justice held that Ireland was not protecting the species with the strictness that the directive required . 
 = = = = Monitoring = = = = 
 In a report to the European Commission covering 1988 – 2007 , the conservation status of the species in Ireland was declared " favourable ( FV ) " in all evaluated criteria ( range , population , habitat and future prospects ) . However , the validity of this assessment was put into question by the European Court of Justice ruling discussed above , which held that Ireland was not monitoring the slug properly . 
 The need to improve monitoring was discussed by the NPWS Threat Response Plan of 2010 , which recognised that population statistics were still deficient , particularly outside the SACs . As the Threat Response Plan noted , species monitoring is a process in which distribution and status of the subject are evaluated systematically over time . Under this definition no monitoring of the Kerry Slug had yet been undertaken in Ireland as of May 2010 . In order to take matters forward , the Kerry Slug Survey of Ireland , a collaboration between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Applied Ecology Unit at the National University of Ireland , Galway , researched a " suitable monitoring protocol " for the species . The Kerry Slug Survey 's investigations resulted in the publication of a guide to the population dynamics of the Kerry slug ; this guide was published as part of the Irish Wildlife Manual series in 2011 . 
 = = = Captive breeding = = = 
 Since 1990 , the species has been successfully bred in captivity . The Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust , a British conservation organisation , operates a captive breeding programme in <unk> at its " Endangered Species Breeding Unit " . The project is located not within the species ' normal range , but in England at the Martin Mere Wetland Centre . During the 1990s , slugs from the breeding programme were given out to a number of different zoos and individuals in order to set up their own breeding programmes , but unfortunately only a very few of those breeding groups survived . 
 = Michigan State Trunkline Highway System = 
 The State Trunkline Highway System consists of all the state highways in Michigan , including those designated as Interstate , United States Numbered ( US Highways ) , or State Trunkline highways . In their abbreviated format , these classifications are applied to highway numbers with an I- , US , or M- prefix , respectively . The system is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) and comprises 9 @,@ 669 miles ( 15 @,@ 561 km ) of trunklines in all 83 counties of the state on both the Upper and Lower peninsulas ( UP , LP ) , which are linked by the Mackinac Bridge . Components of the system range in scale from 10 @-@ lane urban freeways with local @-@ express lanes to two @-@ lane rural undivided highways to a non @-@ motorized highway on Mackinac Island where cars are forbidden . The longest highway is nearly 400 miles ( 640 km ) long , while the shortest is about three @-@ quarters of a mile ( about 1 @.@ 2 km ) . Some roads are unsigned highways , lacking signage to indicate their maintenance by MDOT ; these may be remnants of highways that are still under state control whose designations were decommissioned or roadway segments left over from realignment projects . 
 Predecessors to today 's modern highways include the foot trails used by Native Americans in the time before European settlement . Shortly after the creation of the Michigan Territory in 1805 , the new government established the first road districts . The federal government aided in the construction of roads to connect population centers in the territory . At the time , road construction was under the control of the township and county governments . The state government was briefly involved in roads until prohibited by a new constitution in 1850 . Private companies constructed plank roads and charged tolls . Local township roads were financed and constructed through a statute labor system that required landowners to make improvements in lieu of taxes . <unk> coordination of road planning , construction and maintenance was enacted in the late 19th century . 
 In the early 20th century , the constitutional prohibition on state involvement in roads was removed . The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) was created in 1905 , and the department paid counties and townships to improve roads to state standards . On May 13 , 1913 , the State Reward Trunk Line Highways Act was passed , creating the State Trunkline Highway System . The MSHD assigned internal highway numbers to roads in the system , and in 1919 , the numbers were signposted along the roads and marked on maps . The US Highway System was created in 1926 , and highways in Michigan were renumbered to account for the new designations . Legislation in the 1930s consolidated control of the state trunklines in the state highway department . During the 1940s , the first freeways were built in Michigan . With the introduction of the Interstate Highway system in the 1950s , the state aborted an effort to build the Michigan Turnpike , a tolled freeway in the southeast corner of the LP . Construction on Michigan 's Interstates started in the latter part of that decade and continued until 1992 . During that period , several freeways were canceled in the 1960s and 1970s , while others were delayed or modified over environmental and political concerns . Since 1992 , few additional freeways have been built , and in the early years of the 21st century , projects are underway to bypass cities with new highways . 
 = = Numbering = = 
 = = = Usage = = = 
 The letter M in the state highway numbers is an integral part of the designation and included on the diamond @-@ shaped reassurance markers posted alongside the highways . The state 's highways are referred to using an M @-@ n syntax as opposed to Route n or Highway n , which are common elsewhere . This usage dates from 1919 , when Michigan 's state trunklines were first signed along the roadways , and continues to this day in official and unofficial contexts . Michigan is one of only two states following this syntax , the other one being Kansas . 
 Although M @-@ n outside of Michigan could conceivably refer to other state , provincial , local , or national highways , local usage in those areas does not mimic the Michigan usage in most cases . In countries like the United Kingdom , M refers to motorways , analogous to freeways in the United States , whereas M @-@ numbered designations in Michigan simply indicate state trunklines in general and may exist on any type of highway . M @-@ numbered trunklines are designated along a variety of roads , including eight @-@ lane freeways in urban areas , four @-@ lane rural freeways and expressways , principal arterial highways , and two @-@ lane highways in remote rural areas . The system also includes M @-@ 185 on Mackinac Island , a non @-@ motorized road restricted to bicycles , horse @-@ drawn carriages and pedestrians . 
 The highest numbers used for highway designations include M @-@ 553 in the UP and Interstate 696 ( I @-@ 696 ) running along the northern Detroit suburbs . The lowest numbers in use are M @-@ 1 along Woodward Avenue in the Detroit area and US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) across the UP . Most M @-@ numbered trunkline designations are in the low 200s or under , but some have been designated in the low 300s . MDOT has not assigned a designation outside the Interstate System in the 400s at this time . No discernible pattern exists in Michigan 's numbering system , although most of the M @-@ numbered routes lower than 15 are typically located in or around the major cities of Detroit and Grand Rapids . 
 = = = Numerical duplication = = = 
 Unlike some other states , there are no formal rules prohibiting the usage of the same route number under different systems . Motorists using Michigan 's highways may encounter I @-@ 75 and M @-@ 75 , as well as both US 8 and M @-@ 8 . Many of the state 's US Highways were assigned numbers duplicating those of state trunklines when the US Highway System was created in 1926 . The introduction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s further complicated the situation , as each mainline Interstate designation has an unrelated M @-@ n trunkline counterpart elsewhere in the state . 
 Many former US Highways in Michigan have left an M @-@ numbered highway with the same number as a relic of their existence . For example , M @-@ 27 runs along a portion of former US 27 . In addition , there are two occurrences of original M @-@ numbered state routes which became US Highways with the same designations : all of M @-@ 16 became US 16 and most of M @-@ 10 from Detroit to Saginaw was assumed into the route of US 10 in 1926 . In fact , each iteration of M @-@ 10 has existed in whole or part along a former or future alignment of US 10 . 
 There are also instances of M @-@ numbered state highways that once existed as extensions of US Highways . M @-@ 25 was originally an extension of US 25 before the latter was decommissioned in Michigan , and M @-@ 24 was once an extension of US 24 before routing changes separated the two highways . M @-@ 131 was an extension of US 131 until US 131 was routed onto the former M @-@ 131 . There was also once an M @-@ 112 that served as an alternate routing for US 112 ( both have since been changed to I @-@ 94 and US 12 , respectively ) . 
 = = Highway systems = = 
 There are four types of highways maintained by MDOT as part of the overall State Trunkline Highway System . In addition , there are systems of roads maintained by the federal government and local counties . There are frequent overlaps between designations when different types of highways share the same stretch of pavement in concurrencies . As just one example of the phenomenon , the freeway between Flint and Standish carries both the I @-@ 75 and US 23 designations for around 75 miles ( 121 km ) . 
 = = = State Trunkline Highways = = = 
 The State Trunkline Highway System comprises four types of highways : Michigan 's portions of the Interstate Highway System and United States Numbered Highway System ( US Highways ) , and the regular state trunklines ; the fourth type , special routes , are variations of the other three types of highway , and are distinguished by special plates placed above the route marker . The plates indicate the routes as business or connector routes . Business loops and spurs of the Interstate Highway System use a special green version of the standard Interstate marker which places the word " Business " at the top where " Interstate " would otherwise appears . These business loops and spurs connect downtown districts to main highways after realignments and bypasses have routed the main highway out of the downtown area . Another category , connector routes , serve to connect two highways as their names suggest ; most of these connectors are unsigned . The highways names for special routes are formulated by prefacing the parent highway with the type of special route . The full names are commonly abbreviated like other highways : Business Loop Interstate 196 ( BL I @-@ 196 ) , Business M @-@ 60 ( Bus . M @-@ 60 ) or Connector M @-@ 44 ( Conn . M @-@ 44 ) . As of 2010 there are 9 @,@ 669 miles ( 15 @,@ 561 km ) of state trunklines in Michigan , making up about eight percent of the state 's roadways . Of that mileage , some 4 @,@ 415 miles ( 7 @,@ 105 km ) of state @-@ maintained highways are included in the National Highway System , which are highways selected for their importance to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . The state trunkline highways in Michigan carry approximately 51 percent of the state 's traffic , as of 2007 . 
 The highways in the system range in length from the unsigned Business Spur Interstate 375 ( BS I @-@ 375 ) at 0 @.@ 170 miles ( 0 @.@ 274 km ) and signed M @-@ 212 at 0 @.@ 732 miles ( 1 @.@ 178 km ) to I @-@ 75 at 395 @.@ 40 miles ( 636 @.@ 33 km ) . Some trunklines in Michigan are maintained by MDOT but bear no signage along the route to indicate so . These unsigned trunklines are mostly segments of former highway designations that have been moved or decommissioned . They remain under state control until their respective city or county accepts jurisdiction of the roadway from the state . 
 Highways in the state maintained by MDOT range from two @-@ lane rural highways up to 12 @-@ lane freeways . In addition to the Interstates , other trunklines are built to freeway standards . Sections of US 10 , US 23 , US 31 , US 127 and US 131 have been upgraded to freeway standards . All or part of several state trunklines are also freeways . In the Metro Detroit area , M @-@ 5 , M @-@ 8 ( Davison Freeway ) , M @-@ 10 ( Lodge Freeway ) , M @-@ 14 , M @-@ 39 ( Southfield Freeway ) , M @-@ 53 ( Van Dyke Freeway ) , and M @-@ 59 have such sections . In the rest of the state , M @-@ 6 near Grand Rapids , Conn . M @-@ 13 near Bay City , M @-@ 47 near Midland , M @-@ 60 near Jackson , and Bus . US 131 near Kalamazoo are also freeways , for all or part of their respective lengths . Sections of US 12 , M @-@ 20 , M @-@ 37 , M @-@ 46 , M @-@ 55 , M @-@ 66 and US 223 have been routed to run concurrently with other freeways as well . 
 As of January 2013 , there are three sources of revenue that contribute to the Michigan Transportation Fund ( MTF ) : fuel excise taxes , vehicle registration fees and federal aid . Michigan levies an excise tax of 18 @.@ 7 cents per gallon on gasoline and 15 cents per gallon on diesel fuel to generate approximately $ 955 million in revenue per year . Vehicle registrations account for about $ 868 million while federal aid from federal fuel taxes accounts for the last third of funding in Michigan . Money from the MTF is distributed between MDOT , county road commissions , city or village street departments and local public transit agencies . For fiscal year 2013 , MDOT has budgeted approximately $ 1 @.@ 2 billion on the highway system , including $ 273 @.@ 4 million in routine maintenance . The remainder financed major projects in terms of planning , right @-@ of @-@ way acquisition or construction . In terms of winter maintenance , MDOT classifies all state highways into two priority levels for snow removal , authorizing overtime to clear some highways in the state . 
 = = = County roads and other systems = = = 
 MDOT assigns the numbers for a parallel system of county @-@ designated highways in the state ; the numbers are assigned in a grid system by the department . These highways , while signed from connecting trunklines and shown on the official MDOT map , are maintained by the various counties . They were started in 1970 as a supplement to the main trunkline system and carry a letter @-@ number combination on the national standard pentagon @-@ shaped marker in blue and yellow . The letter component of the name corresponds to a zone of the state ; zones A – F are in the Lower Peninsula while G and H are in the Upper Peninsula . The numbers correspond to a numbered grid within each lettered zone . Other county systems are designated and maintained in each of the 83 counties , and signage and numbering practices vary . The state 's 533 incorporated cities and villages also maintain their own street networks , but townships in the state have no jurisdiction over roads . 
 The U.S. Forest Service and Federal Highway Administration designate Federal Forest Highways providing access to the handful of National Forests in the state . In addition , Michigan participates in the Great Lakes Circle Tour program , signing tours along the state @-@ maintained highway closest to Michigan 's Great Lakes shorelines . The Michigan Heritage Route System was created in 1993 to highlight trunklines with historic , recreational or scenic qualities ; the name was changed to Pure Michigan Byway on December 30 , 2014 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 The history of the highway system in Michigan dates back to the old Native American trails that crossed the state . These trails were pathways no wider than approximately 12 – 18 inches ( 30 – 46 cm ) , permitting single @-@ file traffic . Many of the modern highways in the state follow the path of these old trails , including the Great Trail from Fort Pitt to Fort Detroit which is now US 24 from Detroit to Toledo , Ohio . This trail connected with Braddock 's Road which led to the Atlantic Coast . 
 The Michigan Territory was established in 1805 , and the territorial governor established the first road districts . The districts built farm @-@ to @-@ market roads to serve the agricultural needs of the farming population of the area at the time ; they connected farmers with markets in their local communities . The local streets in the individual communities were the responsibility of those communities . At the same time , Detroit created 120 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 37 m ) rights @-@ of @-@ way for the five great avenues in the city following a fire . 
 Outside of Detroit , the situation was quite different . Maps of the territory were printed with the words " interminable swamp " across the interior until 1839 . Reports of the first explorers and government surveyors crossing the future state only seemed to confirm the assessment that Michigan land was unsuitable for agriculture or other productive activities . The few roads in the area were impassable for half of the year . The poor quality of the early roads meant that most transportation in the state was by way of the lakes and rivers at first . Commerce was limited to trade to and from Canada . 
 These roads proved inadequate to the needs of the military during the War of 1812 . Territorial Governor Lewis Cass lobbied the federal government for road construction funding to bolster defensive needs as well as aid in settlement of the territory . Military roads debuted in 1816 with the construction of the Detroit – Fort Meigs Road to Toledo as a response to transportation needs . More roads were built with Congressional appropriations in the 1820s and 1830s connecting Detroit to Port Huron , Saginaw , Grand Rapids and Chicago . 
 Townships were given authority to construct roads under the supervision of county commissioners in 1817 . This supervision was difficult since in one case , one county covered all of the Upper Peninsula and several of today 's counties in the Lower Peninsula . Direct supervision over construction was granted to the townships in 1827 , and federal involvement in road building ended with the 1837 grant of statehood . 
 The first state constitution encouraged state involvement in internal improvements like roads . The Panic of 1837 devastated the new state 's efforts , and the government defaulted on bond payments . Private construction companies built roads starting in 1844 to fill the void in long @-@ distance road construction left by the departure of the federal government . The first roads were corduroy roads ; to build these , logs of all sizes were placed across the road . The gaps between the logs were filled in with smaller logs or earth . In swampy or marshy areas , brush was laid down first for drainage . In time , the logs would rot , leaving large gaps to the roadway that would catch wagon wheels or draft animal feet . Later , roads were built with oak planks . The plank road companies had to be chartered by the state after passage of legislation in 1848 . According to the plank road law , these companies had to build their roads to a set of minimum specifications . These specifications included 2 – 4 rods ( 33 – 66 ft ; 10 – 20 m ) in total width , a road surface 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) wide with at least 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) made of 3 @-@ inch ( 8 cm ) planks . Later amendments to the law allowed the companies to substitute gravel for the planks . Starting with the enactment of a new state constitution in 1850 , the state was prohibited from being " a part to , or interested in , any work of internal improvement " ; this provision ended the state government 's involvement in Michigan 's roads . 
 The early plank roads were funded by tolls ; these fares were collected at turnstiles every few miles along the roads , at rates of $ 0 @.@ 02 / mile for wagons pulled by two animals ( equivalent to $ 0 @.@ 57 in 2015 ) . As time passed , the planks would warp and rot . The tolls were insufficient to fund the maintenance necessary to keep the roads in good repair . Even Mark Twain remarked , " The road could not have been bad if some unconscionable scoundrel had not now and then dropped a plank across it , " after a trip to Grand Rapids . The planks were removed over time and replaced with gravel roads . The longest chartered road was a distance of 220 miles ( 350 km ) from Zilwaukee to Mackinaw City by way of Traverse City ; the shortest was a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) near Sault Ste . Marie . 
 Townships continued to maintain and build local roads using the " statute labor system " . An able @-@ bodied man residing in a local road district was expected to pay his road taxes by performing 30 days of labor on the roads in his district . If he was unable to work off the tax , a rate of $ 0 @.@ 625 / day was assessed ( equivalent to $ 17 @.@ 78 in 2015 ) . This road maintenance was performed under the guidance of the township road overseer , a separate elected township official , according to the wishes of his constituents , often without any county @-@ level planning or coordination . Often the " improved roads " were in worse condition than unimproved roads due to the amateur nature of the maintenance . 
 An early form of federal aid contributed to the road network in the state starting in the 1850s . Congress granted certain forest and swamp lands to the state in 1850 . A stipulation on the grant stated that the proceeds from the lands would be used to reclaim them for use . The Michigan Legislature established several roads to be built by contractors , paid with the proceeds from the sale of the land adjoining the roads , or with land itself . Despite these efforts , only 1 @,@ 179 miles ( 1 @,@ 897 km ) of the 5 @,@ 082 miles ( 8 @,@ 179 km ) of plank roads authorized by the state were ever built by 89 of the 202 chartered plank road companies . 
 The tax system was partially reformed in 1881 , allowing for direct payment of road taxes instead of relying totally on the statute @-@ labor system . The first road district larger than the township level was created in Bay County in 1883 under Public Act 278 . This road district encompassed eight townships and provided for better coordination and planning of road construction . Other county systems were created in 1893 with passage of legislation which allowed other counties to follow the lead of Bay County . By 1900 , the plank roads were generally abandoned . While a few were still in good repair , most consisted of rotting logs with intermittent patches of gravel . Toll houses were empty shacks , and the ditches were clogged with duck ponds . Only 23 of the original 202 plank roads chartered by the state were still in operation . 
 The Good Roads Movement , borne out of the needs of the bicycle craze of the 1880s and 1890s , turned its attention towards the needs of automobiles at the turn of the century . Horatio S. " Good Roads " Earle , a state senator from Detroit was elected national president of the League of American <unk> in 1901 . Earle worked on a committee report that called for the removal of the prohibition on road improvements from the state constitution . That report also recommended the creation of a commission and system for state highways . 
 = = = Early 20th century = = = 
 The first state road agency , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) , was created on July 1 , 1905 . At first the department administered rewards to the counties and townships for building roads to state minimum specifications . In 1905 , there were 68 @,@ 000 miles ( 110 @,@ 000 km ) of roads in Michigan . Of these roads , only 7 @,@ 700 miles ( 12 @,@ 000 km ) were improved with gravel and 245 miles ( 394 km ) were macadam . The state 's statute labor system was abolished in 1907 . Instead , a property tax system was instituted with the funding only for permanent improvements , not maintenance . Rural farmers opposed the state 's efforts , and even Henry Ford was against the idea of reforming road construction and maintenance . In response to this opposition , the department 's work was decentralized ; standards for road improvement came from the state , but work was carried out by the townships and counties . The nation 's first mile of concrete roadway was laid along Woodward Avenue in 1909 between Six Mile and Seven Mile roads in Detroit ; this section of street was 17 feet 8 inches ( 5 @.@ 38 m ) wide and cost $ 14 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 2 @,@ 171 @,@ 400 in 2015 ) . 
 Passage of the State Reward Trunk Line Highways Act on May 13 , 1913 , provided for 3 @,@ 000 miles ( 4 @,@ 828 km ) of roadways in a state @-@ financed system . The system comprised 10 divisions , several of which had associated branches , that ran along existing roads throughout the state . After the creation of the system , the Huron Shore Road Association scheduled a Road Bee Day on June 13 , 1913 ; some 5 @,@ 000 men , 200 women , 3 @,@ 000 teams of horses and 750 automobiles participated in the effort that improved 200 miles ( 320 km ) of roads in the state . Further legislation at the time allowed for special assessment taxing districts for road improvements , taxation of automobiles based on weight and horsepower , and tree @-@ planting along highway roadsides . Congress passed the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 , and the state passed a constitutional amendment in 1917 to qualify for federal aid with state funding matches . 
 The first centerline was painted on a state highway in 1917 along the Marquette @-@ Negaunee Road which was designated Trunkline 15 , now County Road 492 in Marquette County . Winter maintenance started during World War I to keep 590 miles ( 950 km ) of strategic highways clear ; some $ 13 @,@ 200 ( equivalent to $ 1 @,@ 005 @,@ 300 in 2015 ) was appropriated with partial funding from the War Loan Board . 
 In 1919 , the legislature passed the Aldrich Act ; combined with the approval of the Bond Issue Act during an election that April , the MSHD was authorized to assume responsibility over the roadways that composed the State Trunkline Highway System . The state highway commissioner was required to sign the state trunkline highways , and Michigan become the second state after Wisconsin to do so . Alan Williams , Ionia County engineer , helped to design the diamond marker used to sign the highways ; he is also known for placing a picnic table alongside US 16 ( Grand River Avenue ) in 1929 south of Saranac , considered the first in the country . Other sources say that the first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US 2 near Iron River in 1919 – 20 . The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan avenues in Detroit on October 9 , 1917 . The tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before it was replaced in October 1920 with the world 's first four @-@ way traffic light . 
 While Michigan was the second state to post route designations along its highway system in 1919 , Michigan actually began assigning internal trunkline designations for internal inventory purposes as early as 1913 . From 1918 to 1926 , only the M @-@ numbered highway designations existed on state highways throughout Michigan , while the creation of the US Highway System in 1926 caused several existing designations to be either reassigned or retired altogether . Public Act 131 of 1931 allowed the MSHD to take control over the city and village streets that carried state highways through cities and villages in the state . The 1932 <unk> Act consolidated all of the township @-@ controlled roads into 83 county road commissions . On May 4 , 1935 , the state opened the first highway welcome center next to US 12 in New Buffalo near the Indiana state line ; Michigan was the first state in the country to do so at the time . 
 = = = Mid @-@ 20th century = = = 
 The state passed legislation in 1941 that authorized the creation of limited @-@ access roadways ; the MSHD could prohibit access to a state trunkline from the adjacent properties . Around the same time , single @-@ digit highways like M @-@ 9 were renumbered to set aside those numbers for future freeways in the state . During World War II , the Willow Run Expressway , the Detroit Industrial Expressway and the Davison Freeway were built , ushering in the beginnings of the state 's freeway system . These highway improvements were financed by the Defense Highway Act of 1941 to aid in national defense . After the war , the MSHD and the Good Roads Federation studied the highway needs of the state . Their study reported that road maintenance and improvement deteriorated since the Great Depression . It also stated that funding needed to be increased to deal with pressures from traffic increases after the war . 
 Public Act 51 of 1951 amended and clarified the current system of jurisdiction over roads in the state . The existing tri @-@ level system was maintained , splitting road jurisdiction between the state , counties and cities , as well as subdividing each level into several classifications . Further legislation redefined the exact distribution , but Act 51 set up a system to distribute road funding from gas taxes from a single funding source , currently the Michigan Transportation Fund . Funding was increased during the 1950s as the fuel taxes were increased . Whereas those revenues during the war dropped to levels barely sufficient to keep existing highways in usable condition , they were increased during the following decade to deal with increasing traffic . The state highway department was also authorized to sell bonds to provide funding for the proposed road improvements . 
 The Michigan Turnpike Authority ( MTA ) , an agency created in 1951 , proposed the construction of a toll freeway to run north – south in the state . The original termini for the Michigan Turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood . The state highway commissioner at the time , Charles Ziegler , distrusted a separate agency dealing with statewide road building at the time and worked to stall progress on any proposed turnpikes . He also opposed the idea because the state had three freeways under planning or construction . Ziegler and the MSHD announced plans for a full freeway to run north through the Lower Peninsula and continue across to the Upper Peninsula . This announcement derailed the efforts to build the Michigan Turnpike . The Interstate Highway System was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 , and the state had already designed several freeways for its portion of that system . Seizing the opportunity brought by a 1957 state law , the department sold $ 700 million in bonds ( equivalent to $ 14 @.@ 1 billion in 2015 ) in the late 1950s and early 1960s to finance land purchases and construction of the new freeways . The first Interstate Highway in the state was signposted in October 1959 when I @-@ 75 signs were first installed along the Detroit – Toledo Expressway . These signs replaced US 24A signage in the Monroe area , after the state received final approval for the numbering system to be used in the state . Michigan was the first state to complete a border @-@ to @-@ border Interstate Highway in 1960 with the completion of I @-@ 94 . The last gravel state highway was paved in the early 1960s as well ; bids were let in March 1962 to finish paving M @-@ 48 in Chippewa County . 
 The original goal of Michigan 's freeways was to connect every city with a population of more than 50 @,@ 000 people with a network of roads that would accommodate traffic at 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . Following the start of these highway improvements , the MSHD adopted a policy to allow traffic to use the state 's trunklines every day of the year regardless of the weather . The state also invested in improving non @-@ freeway roads in the highway system ; better materials and construction methods were used to improve safety and traffic flow throughout the state . 
 The post @-@ war years were also a period of major bridge building in the state . The Mackinac Bridge opened on November 1 , 1957 , the Portage Lake Lift Bridge , the largest double @-@ deck lift bridge was completed in August 1959 , and the International Bridge opened across the St. Marys River three years later on October 31 , 1962 . The State Highway Department started erecting mileposts along the Interstates in 1963 , and later expanded the practice to other freeways and used the mileages to number the interchanges along I @-@ 94 . 
 = = = Late 20th century = = = 
 Freeway construction continued through the 1970s . On April 6 , 1972 , the New Buffalo Welcome Center was relocated from its previous location next to US 12 to one adjacent to I @-@ 94 . Later that year , the state switched paint colors for its <unk> ; yellow was used for the lines separating directions of travel and white for lines separating lanes traveling in the same direction . Also in 1972 , a gas tax increase was passed to facilitate US and state highway improvement projects . The final section of I @-@ 75 between Alger and Roscommon was opened on November 1 , 1973 , in a dedication by Governor William G. Milliken , completing the longest highway in the state . In 1974 , the state implemented mileage @-@ based exit numbers along the remaining Interstates in Michigan . By late 1977 , the state highway department shifted its focus from construction of new highways to improvements of the existing system . 
 During the 1960s and 1970s , various freeway projects in the Detroit area were cancelled or scaled back in scope . The route of I @-@ 96 along Grand River Avenue was cancelled in response to freeway revolts in the city , and a new routing along the C & O Railroad right @-@ of @-@ way in Livonia was used instead . Plans to transfer the Davison Freeway in the 1970s to state control and extend it west to I @-@ 96 ( Jeffries Freeway ) and east to a Van Dyke Freeway ( extended M @-@ 53 ) were dropped . Another freeway project near Lansing , the Van Atta Connector , was proposed in 1961 to provide an eastern freeway beltway around East Lansing , but by 1981 the highway 's impact to neighboring elementary schools along with larger economic impacts led to the project 's cancellation . 
 The Michigan Highway Commission canceled the northern section of I @-@ 275 on January 26 , 1977 , after it spent $ 1 @.@ 6 million ( equivalent to $ 10 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) the year before purchasing land for the roadway . This northern section was not planned as an Interstate Highway at that time , bearing the designation M @-@ 275 instead . Opposition to construction came from various citizen 's groups , different levels of local government , and both The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press . The Detroit City Council , led by then @-@ Chairman Carl Levin , opposed the plan as well . Levin said at the time , " At last I think people are waking up to the dangers of more and more expressways . At some point we 've got to say enough . And I think we 've reached it . " The United States Department of the Interior reviewed the state 's environmental impact study of the project and stated the project " will cause irreparable damages on recreation lands , wetlands , surface waters and wildlife habitat . " The total project to link Farmington Hills with Davisburg with the 24 @-@ mile ( 39 km ) freeway would have cost $ 69 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 409 million in 2015 ) and saved drivers an estimated eight minutes off travel time around the city of Detroit . Other freeway projects cancelled during the 1970s included an extension of the US 131 freeway northward to Petoskey , an extension of the US 23 freeway from Standish to Alpena , and a freeway running across the southern Lower Peninsula toward Chicago . These ventures , along with the I @-@ 275 extension , were dropped over concerns related to rising construction costs , the environment and the Arab Oil Embargo . Even with these cancelled highways , several proposals were left to be completed . 
 At the end of the 1970s , MDOT took part in a FHWA @-@ backed initiative called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project , and the two agencies audited signage practices in the vicinity of the I @-@ 96 / M @-@ 37 and I @-@ 296 / US 131 interchange in Walker near Grand Rapids . MDOT determined that usage of the I @-@ 296 designation was " a potential source of confusion for motorists . " FHWA agreed with the department 's proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to the designation in April 1979 . MDOT then received permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) on October 13 , and from the FHWA on December 3 , 1979 , on the condition that MDOT would continue to use the designation on official documents . The approval explicitly retained the highway in the Interstate system for funding and other purposes . The last state map to show the I @-@ 296 designation was published in 1979 , as the 1980 map lacks any reference to the designation . 
 Following this program , the Reflective Systems Unit at MDOT reviewed the state of two- and three @-@ way concurrencies along the highway system in Michigan . They approached the department 's Trunkline Numbering Committee and the district traffic and safety engineers on October 19 , 1982 , for proposals to reduce or eliminate the various overlapping designations to " avoid driver confusion and save funds " . When the unit released its final recommendations on March 17 , 1983 , the memo recommended 19 changes to eliminate various concurrent routings , including the truncation of US 2 to St. Ignace , changes to the routing of US 10 , and the removal of US 33 from the state . These changes were implemented October 1983 , 1985 , and 1986 , respectively . Other changes recommended at the time , like the truncation of M @-@ 54 to remove it from the wrong @-@ way concurrency with M @-@ 83 near Birch Run , has never been implemented .

 The final section of the controversial I @-@ 696 opened at a cost of $ 436 million ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 06 billion in 2015 ) on December 15 , 1989 ; the freeway 's central segment was delayed over concerns related to its routing through Detroit 's northern suburbs . The 1 @,@ 241 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 997 km ) Interstate Highway network in Michigan was completed in 1992 with the last four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) of I @-@ 69 near the Lansing area . Since the completion of these freeways , a handful of major projects have added to the trunkline system and the end of the 20th and the start of the 21st centuries . A bypass of St. Johns along US 27 ( now US 127 ) opened on August 31 , 1998 . M @-@ 6 , a southern freeway bypass of Grand Rapids first proposed in the 1960s , was built between 1997 and 2004 ; that freeway was controversial based on the choice of a minority @-@ owned subcontractor and route location . Bypasses of Cadillac and Manton opened in 2001 and 2003 , extending the US 131 freeway northward . The final segment of the M @-@ 5 Haggerty Connector opened to traffic on November 1 , 2002 . Another venture was the construction of a new bridge over the Grand River in Ottawa County for a highway designated M @-@ 231 ; that highway opened in October 2015 . 
 = = Future = = 
 There are several future highway projects current in stages of planning or construction . One is looking at improvements to US 131 in St. Joseph County , which includes the bypass of Constantine that opened in October 2013 . MDOT continues to purchase parcels for right @-@ of @-@ way to be used for future upgrades of US 127 along the expressway section between Ithaca and St. Johns . 
 One project currently on hold would complete the St. Joseph Valley Parkway , a section of US 31 in Berrien County . The original plan for the freeway would have routed US 31 to connect directly into the I @-@ 196 / US 31 interchange on I @-@ 94 . Concerns over the habitat of the Mitchell 's Satyr butterfly meant this routing would need to be redesigned with a set of bridges to cross the habitat unobtrusively in the Blue Creek Fen . In 2001 , MDOT began a study of a new design alternative to route the US 31 freeway to connect with I @-@ 94 at the BL I @-@ 94 interchange just south of the I @-@ 196 / US 31 interchange . In the interim , MDOT built a 9 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 14 @.@ 6 km ) freeway segment north to Napier Avenue that was opened on August 27 , 2003 , at a cost of $ 97 million ( equivalent to $ 137 million in 2015 ) . 
 The United States Congress legislated a highway proposal in 1991 known as I @-@ 73 . Originally set to run along I @-@ 75 to Detroit , the definition was amended in 1995 to include a branch that would run along US 223 and US 127 to Grayling , then on a continuation along I @-@ 75 to Sault Ste . Marie . MDOT examined three options to build the freeway , but abandoned further study after June 12 , 2001 , diverting remaining funds to improvement of safety along the corridor . The department stated there was a " lack of need " for sections of the proposed freeway , and the project 's website was taken offline in 2002 . According to 2011 press reports , a group advocating on behalf of the freeway is working to revive the I @-@ 73 proposal in Michigan , but state and local governments continue to express disinterest in resurrecting the freeway .

 Hey Hey It 's Esther Blueburger is a 2008 Australian independent teen film written and directed by Cathy Randall . It stars Danielle Catanzariti , Keisha Castle @-@ Hughes and Toni Collette . The film follows Jewish 13 @-@ year @-@ old Esther ( Catanzariti ) , an outcast at her posh school , where she has no friends . That changes when she meets nonconformist Sunni ( Castle @-@ Hughes ) from the local public school . 
 With Esther 's character based loosely on her own adolescence , Randall was inspired to write the film 's script by what she saw as a lack of role models for teenage girls . In 2002 , the script earned her a fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School 's Feature Development Programme , where she developed the project , and it was later picked up by Tama Films . Randall returned to Australia for casting , and Catanzariti was eventually chosen in the lead role after she attended an audition for minor roles and extras . Production spanned from October to December 2006 , with filming taking place in Adelaide , South Australia and Sydney , New South Wales . 
 The film premiered on 10 February 2008 at the Berlin International Film Festival and was released in Australia on 20 March 2008 . It failed to earn back its A $ 6 million budget with a total domestic gross of approximately $ 800 @,@ 000 . The film attracted mixed reviews ; some critics praised the originality and the acting , though others found Randall 's direction dull and the script poorly written . Catanzariti won the Australian Film Institute 's Young Actor Award for her performance , and the film received a further three AFI nominations and a nomination for a Film Critics Circle of Australia Award .

 Esther Blueburger is a 13 @-@ year @-@ old Jewish outcast at her posh private school . Things are no better at home , where her twin brother is beginning to develop into a sociopath and her controlling mother pressures Esther to conform . She finds her only friend in a duck called Normal , and she frequently prays into a toilet asking God to " get me out of here " . After escaping her own Bat Mitzvah , Esther bumps into Sunni , a rebellious girl from the local public school , who she had observed and spoken to on previous occasions . 
 The two girls form a friendship , and Esther begins attending Sunni 's school , unbeknownst to her parents , under the guise of a Swedish exchange student . She revels in the easygoing nature of the public school and enjoys spending time with Sunni 's friends and Sunni 's laid @-@ back single mother , Mary , who works as a stripper . As Esther gains popularity and submits to numerous acts of peer pressure – including attacking a girl from her old school – her friendship with Sunni starts to deteriorate . At her old school , meanwhile , her classmates have been led to believe that she was chosen for an elite social experiment , and when she returns she is treated like royalty . 
 Esther later discovers that Mary has died in a motorcycle accident , and a grieving Sunni is transferred to Esther 's private school under her grandmother 's care . Ultimately deciding that being true to herself is more important than fitting in , Esther discards her pretenses and renews her friendship with Sunni .

 Cathy Randall 's script for Hey , Hey , It 's Esther Blueburger stemmed from her desire " to make a film about a kick @-@ ass chick , a heroine for teenagers and people of all ages " , wanting to take a female twist on The Catcher in the Rye 's Holden Caulfield . She said that she had " always been struck by the fact that there are not enough role models for teenage girls " . Esther 's character was drawn loosely from Randall 's own adolescence ; like Esther , she had a Bat Mitzvah , she had a twin brother and she attended both a private and a public school . She explained , however , that the story was " warped and twisted and filtered through my imagination so , in fact , it doesn 't feel like Esther resembles me at all " . 
 Based on her original script , Randall was awarded a fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School 's Feature Development Programme in 2002 . She said that , under the mentorship of the school 's faculty , " The screenplay evolved by becoming lighter and funnier and also the story and structure got tighter . " In 2003 , Randall was nominated for an Australian Writers ' Guild AWGIE Award for Best Unproduced Screenplay . Randall 's script was subsequently picked up by producer Miriam Stein and her production company , Tama Films . Stein said that " The script resonated with me from the start " , particularly because of her similar adolescent experience as a Jewish girl who felt like an outsider . Stein brought the film into production after recruiting Nice Pictures CEO Heather Ogilvie as executive producer , Los Angeles @-@ based Harry <unk> as associate producer and Buena Vista International to handle distribution in Australia and New Zealand .

 To cast the title character , the film 's producers worked with a casting agent to find experienced actors but also held open auditions for 12- to 15 @-@ year @-@ old girls in search of " a new face " . The producers had spent four months overseeing over 3 @,@ 000 girls ' auditions before Danielle Catanzariti attended a cattle call audition advertised in a local newspaper for minor roles and extras . Randall asked Catanzariti to stay behind and read a scene from the script ; she went to a number of callback auditions and was later offered the main role . Having been raised in the Catholic faith , Catanzariti took lessons in Jewish history and Hebrew to prepare for her Bar Mitzvah scenes . 
 Keisha Castle @-@ Hughes was Randall 's first choice for the role of Sunni based on her performance in the New Zealand film Whale Rider ( 2002 ) . Castle @-@ Hughes agreed to star in the film when she first read the script at age 13 , but was 16 by the time finance had been raised and filming began .

 Film industry magazine Screen International critic Peter Brunette noted that in spite of minor faults , the film was " an otherwise enjoyable piece of highly competent , commercial filmmaking , " which " should perform well in all markets , from theatrical through to ancillary . " In a review for The Age , Jake Wilson gave the film 3 stars out of 5 , describing it as " a quirky Australian coming @-@ of @-@ age story that gives the genre a good name " . He wrote that while it lacked the film " craft or <unk> " of other teen movies , the film broke the conventions of the genre . The Sydney Morning Herald 's Sandra Hall awarded Hey , Hey , It 's Esther Blueburger 3 out of 5 stars and thought that it was entertaining but " too polished " . She praised the acting , particularly from Danielle Catanzariti and Russell Dykstra , but felt that the script lacked spontaneity . Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton of At the Movies each gave the film 3 @.@ 5 stars out of 5 .

 Other critics were less positive .

He wrote , " If you think the title screams ' Go watch something else ' , just wait until you get a load of this lame local production . " Jim Schembri of The Age opined that the film was an example of " just how bad local [ Australian ] films can get " . In particular , he criticised the " stiff " performances , the " woeful " directing and the plot 's implausibility . Variety magazine 's Richard Kuipers wrote that the film was " sporadically amusing " and lacked " scripting smarts and pulling power across demographics " . He praised the soundtrack and Castle @-@ Hughes ' portrayal of Sunni , but felt that the film was brought down by dull cinematography and " uninspired dialogue and direction " . Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph noted that the film 's greatest downfall was that " the jokes aren 't funny enough and the sadness barely breaks your heart " . She complimented Toni Collette 's performance but felt that " her slight role is insufficient to make it fly the distance " .

 = Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act = 
 The Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act of 1956 ( Public Law 84 @-@ 830 ) was an Act of Congress passed to improve mental health care in the United States territory of Alaska . It became the focus of a major political controversy after opponents nicknamed it the " Siberia Bill " and denounced it as being part of a communist plot to <unk> and brainwash Americans . Campaigners asserted that it was part of an international Jewish , Roman Catholic or psychiatric conspiracy intended to establish United Nations @-@ run concentration camps in the United States . 
 The legislation in its original form was sponsored by the Democratic Party , but after it ran into opposition , it was rescued by the conservative Republican Senator Barry Goldwater . Under Goldwater 's sponsorship , a version of the legislation without the commitment provisions that were the target of intense opposition from a variety of far @-@ right , anti @-@ Communist and fringe religious groups was passed by the United States Senate . The controversy still plays a prominent role in the Church of Scientology 's account of its campaign against psychiatry . 
 The Act succeeded in its initial aim of establishing a mental health care system for Alaska , funded by income from lands allocated to a mental health trust . However , during the 1970s and early 1980s , Alaskan politicians systematically stripped the trust of its lands , transferring the most valuable land to private individuals and state agencies . The asset stripping was eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation , and a reconstituted mental health trust was established in the mid @-@ 1980s . 
 = = Background to the act = = 
 Alaska possessed no mental health treatment facilities prior to the passage of the 1956 Act . At the time of the Act 's passage , Alaska was not a U.S. state , being constituted instead as a territory of the United States . The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century . On June 6 , 1900 , the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans . In 1904 , a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital , privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland , Oregon , under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment . A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people , who would rule him sane or insane . The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland ; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required . 
 By the 1940s it was recognized that this arrangement was unsatisfactory . The American Medical Association conducted a series of studies in 1948 , followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950 . They highlighted the deficiencies of the program : commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic , and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families . In addition , an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company , which owned the hospital , had been padding its expenses . This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $ 69 @,@ 000 per year ( equivalent to over $ 588 @,@ 000 per year at 2007 prices ) . 
 The studies recommended a comprehensive overhaul of the system , with the development of an in @-@ state mental health program for Alaska . This proposal was widely supported by the public and politicians . At the start of 1956 , in the second session of the 84th Congress , Representative Edith Green ( D @-@ Oregon ) introduced the Alaska Mental Health Bill ( H.R. 6376 ) in the House of Representatives . The bill had been written by Bob Bartlett , the Congressional Delegate from the Alaska Territory who later became a U.S. Senator . Senator Richard L. Neuberger ( D @-@ Oregon ) sponsored an equivalent bill , S. 2518 , in the Senate . 
 = = Details of the bill = = 
 The Alaska Mental Health Bill 's stated purpose was to " transfer from the Federal Government to the Territory of Alaska basic responsibility for the hospitalization , care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska . " In connection with this goal , it aimed : 
 to modernize procedures for such hospitalization ( including commitment ) , care , and treatment and to authorize the Territory to modify or supersede such procedures ; 
 to assist in providing for the Territory necessary facilities for a comprehensive mental @-@ health program in Alaska , including inpatient and outpatient facilities ; 
 to provide for a land grant to the Territory to assist in placing the program on a firm long @-@ term basis ; and 
 to provide for a ten @-@ year program , of grants @-@ in @-@ aid to the Territory to enable the Territory gradually to assume the full operating costs of the program . 
 The bill provided for a cash grant of $ 12 @.@ 5 million ( about $ 94 million at 2007 prices ) to be disbursed to the Alaskan government in a number of phases , to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory . To meet the ongoing costs of the program , the bill transferred one million acres ( 4 @,@ 000 km ² ) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant @-@ in @-@ aid — the federal government owned about 99 % of the land of Alaska at the time . The trust would then be able to use the assets of the transferred land ( principally mineral and forestry rights ) to obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program . Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood . 
 In addition , the bill granted the Governor of Alaska authority to enter into reciprocal mental health treatment agreements with the governors of other states . Alaskans who became mentally ill in the lower 48 states would be properly treated locally until they could be returned to Alaska ; likewise , citizens of the lower 48 who fell mentally ill in Alaska would receive care there , before being returned to their home states . 
 The bill was seen as entirely innocuous when it was introduced on January 16 , 1956 . It enjoyed bipartisan support , and on January 18 it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives . It then fell to the Senate to consider the equivalent bill in the upper chamber , S. 2518 , which was expected to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on February 20 .

 = = = Initial opposition = = = 
 In December 1955 , a small anti @-@ communist women 's group in Southern California , the American Public Relations Forum ( APRF ) , issued an urgent call to arms in its monthly bulletin . It highlighted the proposed text of the Alaska Mental Health Bill , calling it " one that tops all of them " . The bulletin writers commented : " We could not help remembering that Siberia is very near Alaska and since it is obvious no one needs such a large land grant , we were wondering if it could be an American Siberia . " They said that the bill " takes away all of the rights of the American citizen to ask for a jury trial and protect him [ self ] from being railroaded to an asylum by a greedy relative or ' friend ' or , as the Alaska bill states , ' an interested party ' . " 
 The APRF had a history of opposing mental health legislation ; earlier in 1955 , it had played a key role in stalling the passage of three mental health bills in the California Assembly . It was part of a wider network of far @-@ right organizations which opposed psychiatry and psychology as being pro @-@ communist , anti @-@ American , anti @-@ Christian and pro @-@ Jewish . The Keep America Committee , another Californian " <unk> " group , summed up the anti @-@ mental health mood on the far right in a pamphlet issued in May 1955 . Calling " mental hygiene " part of the " unholy three " of the " Communistic World Government " , it declared : " Mental Hygiene is a subtle and diabolical plan of the enemy to transform a free and intelligent people into a cringing horde of zombies " . 
 The APRF 's membership overlapped with that of the much larger Minute Women of the U.S.A. , a nationwide organization of militant anti @-@ communist housewives which claimed up to 50 @,@ 000 members across the United States . In mid @-@ January 1956 , Minute Woman Leigh F. Burkeland of Van Nuys , California issued a bulletin protesting against the bill . It was mimeographed by the California State Chapter of the Minute Women and mailed across the nation . On January 24 , 1956 , the strongly anti @-@ Statist Santa Ana Register newspaper reprinted Burkeland 's statement under the headline , " Now — Siberia , U.S.A. " Burkeland issued a lurid warning of what the future might hold if the Alaska Mental Health Bill was passed by the Senate : 
 Is it the purpose of H.R. 6376 to establish a concentration camp for political prisoners under the guise of treatment of mental cases ? The answer , based on a study of the bill , indicates that it is entirely within the realm of possibility that we may be establishing in Alaska our own version of the Siberia slave camps run by the Russian government . … 
 This legislation , say its opponents , will place every resident of the United States at the mercy of the whims and fancies of any person with whom they might have a disagreement , causing a charge of ' mental illness ' to be placed against them , with immediate deportation to <unk> , U.S.A ! 
 = = = Further opposition = = = 
 After the Santa Ana Register published its article , a nationwide network of activists began a vociferous campaign to torpedo the Alaska Mental Health Bill . The campaigners included , among other groups and individuals , the white supremacist Rev. Gerald L. K. Smith ; Women for God and Country ; the For America League ; the Minute Women of the U.S.A. ; the right @-@ wing agitator Dan Smoot ; the anti @-@ Catholic former US Army Brigadier General Herbert C. Holdridge ; and L. Ron Hubbard 's Church of Scientology , which had been founded only two years earlier . 
 Increasingly strong statements were made by the bill 's opponents through the course of the spring and summer of 1956 . In his February 17 bulletin , Dan Smoot told his subscribers : " I do not doubt that the Alaska Mental Health Act was written by sincere , well @-@ intentioned men . Nonetheless , it fits into a sinister pattern which has been forming ever since the United Nations was organized . " Dr. George A. Snyder of Hollywood sent a letter to all members of Congress in which he demanded an investigation of the Alaska Mental Health Bill 's proponents for " elements of treason against the American people behind the front of the mental health program " . The Keep America Committee of Los Angeles similarly called the proponents of the bill a " conspiratorial gang " that ought to be " investigated , impeached , or at least removed from office " for treason . Retired brigadier general Herbert C. Holdridge sent a public letter to President Dwight Eisenhower on March 12 , in which he called the bill " a dastardly attempt to establish a concentration camp in the Alaskan wastes " . He went on : 
 This bill establishes a weapon of violence against our citizenry far more wicked than anything ever known in recorded history — far worse than the Siberian prison camps of the Czars or the Communists , or the violence of the Spanish Inquisition … The plot of wickedness revealed in this bill fairly reeks of the evil odor of the black forces of the Jesuits who dominate the Vatican , and , through officiates in our Government , dominate our politics . 
 For their part , America 's professional health associations ( notably the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association ) came out in favour of the bill . There was some initial opposition from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons , a small and extremely conservative body which opposed socialized medicine ; Dr. L. S. Sprague of Tucson , Arizona said in its March 1956 newsletter that the bill widened the definition of mental health to cover " everything from falling hair to ingrown toenails " . However , the association modified its position after it became clear that the AMA took the opposite view . 
 By March 1956 , it was being said in Washington , D.C. that the amount of correspondence on the bill exceeded anything seen since the previous high @-@ water mark of public controversy , the Lend @-@ Lease Act of 1941 . Numerous letter @-@ writers protested to their Congressional representatives that the bill was " anti @-@ religious " or that the land to be transferred to the Alaska Mental Health Trust would be fenced off and used as a concentration camp for the political enemies of various state governors . The well @-@ known broadcaster Fulton Lewis described how he had " received , literally , hundreds of letters protesting bitterly against the bill . I have had telephone calls to the same effect from California , Texas and other parts of the country . Members of Congress report identical reactions . " A letter printed in the Daily Oklahoman newspaper in May 1956 summed up many of the arguments made by opponents of the bill : 
 The advocates of world government , who regard patriotism as the symptom of a diseased mind , took a step closer to their goal of compulsory asylum ' cure ' for opponents of UNESCO , when , on January 18 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Alaska Mental Health Act . 
 The Act was prepared by the U.S. Department of Justice , Department of the Interior and the socialist @-@ oriented Department of Health , Education and Welfare . It closely follows the Model Code , drafted by the American Psychiatric association , which has been working with the World Health Organization , a specialized agency of the United Nations … 
 All of you who don 't want members of your family railroaded to an asylum had better start writing your senator , now . 
 During February and March 1956 , hearings were held before the Senate Subcommittee on Territories and Insular Affairs . Proponents and opponents of the bill faced off in a series of tense exchanges , with strong accusations being made against the people and groups involved in the bill 's introduction . Stephanie Williams of the American Public Relations Forum said that the bill would enable Russia to reclaim its former Alaskan territory : " [ It ] contains nothing to prevent Russia from buying the entire million acres — they already say Alaska belongs to them . " 
 Mrs. Ernest W. Howard of the Women 's Patriotic Committee on National Defense castigated the slackness of Congress for not picking up on the bill 's perceived dangers : " Those of us who have been in the study and research work of the United Nations , we feel that we are experts in this ... you as Senators with all the many commitments and the many requirements , are not able to go into all these things . " John Kaspar , a White Citizens ' Council organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton , Tennessee , declared that " almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing . " He argued that Jews were nationalists of another country who were attempting to " usurp American nationality " .

 The arguments of the bill 's opponents attracted little support in the Senate . The Eisenhower administration , the Alaska territorial government and mainstream religious groups were all in favor of the bill . The Alaska Presbyterian Church gave the bill its unanimous support , issuing a statement declaring : " As Christian citizens of Alaska we believe this is a progressive measure for the care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska . We deplore the present antiquated methods of handling our mentally ill . " It also urged the National Council of Churches to mobilize support for the bill . An overwhelming majority of senators of both parties were also supportive . The bill 's original author , Alaska Delegate Bob Bartlett , spoke for many of the bill 's proponents when he expressed his bafflement at the response that it had received : 
 I am completely at a loss in attempting to fathom the reasons why certain individuals and certain groups have now started a letter @-@ writing campaign … to defeat the act . I am sure that if the letter writers would consult the facts , they would join with all others not only in hoping this act would become law but in working for its speedy passage and approval . 
 Other senators expressed similar mystification at the agitation against the bill . Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington stated that he was " at a loss " to see how the bill affected religion , as its opponents said . Senator Alan Bible of Nevada , the acting chairman of the Subcommittee on Territories and Insular Affairs , told the bill 's opponents that nothing in the proposed legislation would permit the removal of any non @-@ Alaskan to the territory for confinement . 
 Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona proposed an amended bill that removed the commitment procedures in title I of the House bill and stated that " Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the transfer to Alaska , pursuant to any agreement or otherwise , of any mentally ill person who is not a resident of Alaska . " In effect , this eliminated the bill 's most controversial element — the provision for the transfer of mental patients from the lower 48 states to Alaska . The final recommendation of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs followed Goldwater 's lead that the bill be amended to strike all the controversial " detailed provisions for commitment , hospitalization , and care of the mentally ill of Alaska " included in title I of the original House bill . This amended proposal left only the transfer of responsibility for mental health care to the territory of Alaska and the establishment of land grants to support this care . The committee stressed that they were not invalidating the title I provisions of the original bill but that they had been misunderstood , a recurrent theme in supporters of the bill : 
 However , the proposed provisions were misunderstood by many persons in parts of the country other than Alaska . Partly as a result of this misunderstanding , but more because the members of the committee are convinced that the people of Alaska are fully capable of drafting their own laws for a mental health program for Alaska , the committee concluded that authority should be vested in them in this field comparable to that of the States and other Territories . 
 Thus amended , the Senate bill ( S. 2973 ) was passed unanimously by the Senate on July 20 , after only ten minutes of debate . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following the passage of the act , an Alaska Mental Health Trust was set up to administer the land and grants appropriated to fund the Alaskan mental health program . During the 1970s , the issue of the trust 's land became increasingly controversial , with the state coming under increasing pressure to develop the land for private and recreational use . In 1978 , the Alaska Legislature passed a law to abolish the trust and transfer the most valuable parcels of lands to private individuals and the government . By 1982 , 40 @,@ 000 acres ( 160 km2 ) had been conveyed to municipalities , 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 200 km2 ) transferred to individuals , and slightly over 350 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 400 km2 ) designated as forests , parks or wildlife areas . Around 35 percent of the land trust remained unencumbered and in state ownership . 
 In 1982 , Alaska resident Vern Weiss filed a lawsuit on behalf of his son , who required mental health services that were not available in Alaska . The case of Weiss v State of Alaska eventually became a class action lawsuit involving a range of mental health care groups . The Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the abolition of the trust had been illegal and ordered it to be reconstituted . However , as much of the original land had been transferred away , the parties had to undergo a long and complex series of negotiations to resolve the situation . A final settlement was reached in 1994 in which the trust was reconstituted with 500 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 000 km2 ) of original trust land , 500 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 000 km2 ) of replacement land , and $ 200 million to replace lost income and assets . 
 = = Scientology and the Alaska Mental Health Bill = = 
 The Alaska Mental Health Bill plays a major part in the Church of Scientology 's account of its campaign against psychiatry . The Church participated in the campaign against the Bill and still refers to it as the " Siberia Bill " . Scientology may also have provided an important piece of the " evidence " which the anti @-@ bill campaigners used — a booklet titled Brain @-@ Washing : A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on <unk> , which has been widely attributed to the anonymous authorship of L. Ron Hubbard ( see Brainwashing Manual ) . 
 = = = Scientology position = = = 
 The church 's official website asserts that the bill was " psychiatry 's attempt to establish a million @-@ acre ( 4 @,@ 000 km ² ) Siberia @-@ type camp for mental health patients in Alaska , far from the prying eyes of civil libertarians " which " presumably ... was far enough away from the well @-@ traveled roads of the world to allow psychiatrists to conduct their mind control and other experiments on a captive population , unhindered by the glare of publicity . " It would give psychiatrists the power to ensure that " Any man , woman or child could be seized and sent without trial to Alaska , deprived of human and civil rights and detained forever , all without trial or examination . " According to the Church 's Freedom Magazine : 
 the bill came to the attention of Scientologists in 1956 , only two years after the Church of Scientology had been established . … Scientologists responded with a campaign to inform the public of the very real threat to personal liberties and freedom of speech posed by the measure . If passed , it would have created a potential " gulag " where political undesirables could be dumped and simply forgotten . 
 The hope of creating this psychiatric slave state was shattered by Scientologists . Refusing to allow vested interests to destroy the right of every citizen to freely speak his opinions without fear of retaliation they instituted a huge grassroots letter campaign . This alerted the Senate to public opposition and testimony was presented at Senate Committee hearings on the bill . Ultimately , except for granting a small amount of money for Alaska to continue " treating " its few existing mental patients , the Senate rejected the Siberia bill and it was never heard of again . 
 Church officials have stated their belief that the American Psychiatric Association intensified its " interest in destroying Dianetics and Scientology organizations ... when the Church of Scientology actively opposed a bill whose introduction in Congress had been secure by the APA . ... The APA was well aware of who was behind the massive response that defeated the legislation , and they never forgot , as can be seen from some of the attacks its members generated . " 
 = = = Miscavige on Nightline = = = 
 Similarly , David Miscavige , the church 's leader , in 1992 told Ted Koppel in an interview on the Nightline program : 
 I don 't know if you 're aware that there was a plan in 1955 in this country , Ted , to repeat what was done in Russia . There was going to be a Siberia , U.S.A. set up on a million acres ( 4 @,@ 000 km ² ) in Alaska to send mental patients . They were going to lessen the commitment laws , you could basically get into an argument with somebody and be sent up there . This sounds very odd . Nobody 's ever heard about it . That 's in no small part thanks to the Church of Scientology . I must say , though , that when that bill was killed in Congress , the war was on with psychiatry where they declared war on us … 
 It was a major , major , major flap for the psychiatrists when it got voted down , because then the slogan around the country began , ' Siberia U.S.A. , ' and it was really the first time that psychiatry had been denigrated publicly , that they weren 't the science that they had been promoting themselves to be . And they took it upon themselves then to start dealing with anybody who would oppose them . 
 = = = Conspiracy theories = = = 
 In Ron 's Journal 67 , Hubbard identified " the people behind the Siberia Bill " , who he asserted were 
 less than twelve men . They are members of the Bank of England and other higher financial circles . They own and control newspaper chains , and they are , oddly enough , directors in all the mental health groups in the world which have sprung up . Now these chaps are very interesting fellows : They have fantastically corrupt backgrounds ; illegitimate children ; government graft ; a very unsavory lot . And they apparently , sometime in the rather distant past , had determined on a course of action . Being in control of most of the gold supplies of the planet , they entered upon a program of bringing every government to bankruptcy and under their thumb , so that no government would be able to act politically without their permission . 
 According to David Miscavige , the bill was the product of a conspiracy by the American Psychiatric Association . In a public address in 1995 , he told Scientologists that it was " in 1955 that the agents for the American Psychiatric Association met on Capitol Hill to ram home the infamous Siberia Bill , calling for a secret concentration camp in the wastes of Alaska . " It was " here that Mr. Hubbard , as the leader of a new and dynamic religious movement , knocked that Siberia Bill right out of the ring — inflicting a blow they would never forget . " The assertion that Scientologists defeated the bill is made frequently in Scientology literature . In fact , the original version of the bill with the offending Title I commitment provisions only passed the House of Representatives ; it was subsequently amended in conference to strike the commitment portion and retain the transfer of responsibility for mental health care . The revised bill passed easily without further changes . 
 = = = Contemporary publications = = = 
 Contemporary Church publications suggest that although Hubbard was tracking progress of the bill at least as early as February 1956 , Scientology did not become involved in the controversy until the start of March 1956 , over two months after the American Public Relations Forum had first publicized the bill . A March " Professional Auditor 's Bulletin " issued by Hubbard , who was staying in Dublin at the time , includes a telegram from his Washington @-@ based son L. Ron Hubbard , Jr. and two other Scientologists alerting him to the upcoming February Senate hearings : 
 HOUSE BILL 6376 <unk> JANUARY <unk> STOP GOES <unk> NEXT <unk> STOP BILL <unk> <unk> OF <unk> TO <unk> <unk> BY <unk> <unk> OF <unk> <unk> BEFORE <unk> <unk> ARE <unk> STOP <unk> WITH <unk> THAT <unk> BE <unk> AT <unk> STOP <unk> CAN BE <unk> FROM <unk> STOP BILL <unk> TO <unk> AT <unk> STOP BILL <unk> UP ONE <unk> <unk> <unk> [ sic ] IN <unk> FOR <unk> STOP LETTER AND BILL <unk> STOP WHAT ACTION YOU <unk> <unk> . 
 Although the church says that Scientologists led the opposition to the bill , the Congressional Record 's account of the Senate hearings into the bill does not mention the church . A contemporary review of the opposition to the bill likewise attributes the lead role elsewhere and to right @-@ wing groups , rather than the " civil liberties " organizations cited by the church : 
 Only a few organized groups got behind the hue and cry . Most influential was the libertarian Association of Physicians and Surgeons , and Dan Smoot 's newsletter . Right @-@ wing groups bombarded Congress with protests and demands for hearings . 
 = The Girl Strike Leader = 
 The Girl Strike Leader is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film deals with labor relations when Hal Stephens disguises himself and works in a factory he was given by his father . As a laborer , he falls in love with a young working girl named Lou and protects her against a manager . Lou leads a strike when wages are ordered to be cut by 10 % , but the strikers return to work on the verge of starvation . Lou , who resists , is saved by Hal who assumes control , restores the wages and removes the previous manager . 
 The film may have been inspired by the real 1909 strike of the New York City shirtwaist makers , but the strike ended without settlement . The scenario is bears the hallmarks of the successful dime novels with an improbable resolution . Released on July 8 , 1910 , the film has received attention for presenting labor issues , but the film is presumed lost . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from July 9 , 1910 . It states : " Hal Stephens , a wealthy young man , devotes all his time to enjoying himself , thereby earns the disapproval of his staid old father . The elder Stephen sees the young man start off on an auto trip with some gay friends , and decides to call a halt . He notifies his son by telegram that it is time he went to work , and presents him with the factory . This arouses the merriment of his friends , but Hal declares that he will buckle down and go to work . He tells his father , however , that he desires to start incognito , and the father consents . Hal enters the factory and goes to work as an ordinary laborer , his identity being unknown to all . He meets Lou , a young working girl , and falls in love with her . The manager of the place , one Conners , tries to make love to Lou , and Hal protects her . There is an order put up reducing salaries 10 % , and Lou induces the others to strike rather than to submit . The strikers , starved out , finally return to work , with the exception of Lou , who is defiant to the end . Hal finds her weeping on the steps of her home and tells her of his love . She agrees to marry him . After she has accepted him , he leads her to the factory , announces his identity , assumes possession , and restores wages to the old scale , after having discharged the rogue Conners . "

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . Michael S. Shull , author of Radicalism in American Silent Films , 1909 @-@ 1929 : A Filmography and History , believes the scenario was inspired by a New York City shirtwaist makers strike that began in the winter of 1909 . The strike would end without settlement , but it would be dramatized by Theresa Malkiel , a labor activist . The fictional autobiography written by Malkiel , The Diary of a Shirtwaist Striker , was serialized in New York Caller a socialist paper . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The only credit known for the cast is that of Mrs. George W. Walters in the role of a poor factory worker . Other members cast may have included the other leading players of the Thanhouser productions , Anna Rosemond , Frank H. Crane and Violet Heming .

 The single reel drama , approximate 1000 feet long , was released on July 8 , 1910 . Theaters in Indiana and Pennsylvania were among those which advertised the film , one specifically focusing on the film having dealing with " the labor question " . A review in The Moving Picture News was contained detailed praise of the film 's relevance and success in portraying the subject . The reviewer states , " This film strikes home . ... The situation has been lived in New York City . The strike and its miseries are not forgotten . Whoever arranged the story had a big , tender heart and knew what appeals to the masses . The glee with which the superintendent 's discomfiture was hailed by the audience spoke volumes . We wish some of the pictures were not quite so vividly black and white . <unk> the tenseness of the situation hit the cameraman . Be that as it may , one thing is certain - there is no melodrama , but scenes out of real life . " While the reviewer in this case refers to the scenario being drawn from real life , the happy ending is termed as a fantasy by reviewer in The Moving Picture World who states , " [ It is one ] of those pictures which thrill one despite their improbability . It may go in stories but never in fact , that an owner of a factory marries one of his girl employees , and a strike leader at that ... " 
 Nan <unk> , author of Ladies of Labor , Girls of Adventure : Working Women , Popular Culture , and Labor Politics at the Turn of the Twentieth Century says that the film relied on the dime novel formula as much as the labor @-@ capital conventions to depict its story . Kay Sloan , author of The Loud Silents : Origins of the Social Problem Film , confirms that the simplified plot of the film is of the dime novel order . Barbara <unk> , author of The Wayward Woman : Progressivism , Prostitution , and Performance in the United States , 1888 – 1917 , highlights that the girls are striking against the actions of Connor instead of the owner and that Lou is portrayed as attractive , defiant and virtuous . Steven J. Ross would cite this film as the first in a list of films that would progressively depict female labor activists as the agent of justice in contrast to the gender biases of film makers . 
 = Vampire folklore by region = 
 Legends of vampires have existed for millennia ; cultures such as the Mesopotamians , Hebrews , Ancient Greeks , and Romans had tales of demonic entities and blood @-@ drinking spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires . Despite the occurrence of vampire @-@ like creatures in these ancient civilizations , the folklore for the entity we know today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th @-@ century Southeastern Europe , particularly Transylvania as verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published . In most cases , vampires are revenants of evil beings , suicide victims , or witches , but can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire itself . Belief in such legends became so rife that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires . 
 = = Ancient beliefs = = 
 Tales of the undead consuming the blood or flesh of living beings have been found in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries . Today we know these entities predominantly as vampires , but in ancient times , the term vampire did not exist ; blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood ; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire . Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon , from the ghouls of Arabia to the goddess Sekhmet of Egypt . Indeed , some of these legends could have given rise to the European folklore , though they are not strictly considered vampires by historians when using today 's definitions . 
 = = = Mesopotamia = = = 
 Mesopotamia was an area rampant with superstition of blood @-@ drinking demons . The Persians were one of the first civilizations thought to have tales of blood @-@ drinking demons : creatures attempting to drink blood from men were depicted on excavated pottery shards . Ancient Babylonia had tales of the mythical Lilitu , synonymous with and giving rise to Lilith ( Hebrew <unk> ) and her daughters the <unk> from Hebrew demonology . Lilith was considered a demon and was often depicted as subsisting on the blood of babies . The legend of Lilith was originally included in some traditional Jewish texts : according to the medieval folk traditions , she was considered to be Adam 's first wife before Eve . In these texts , Lilith left Adam to become the queen of the demons ( she actually refused to be Adam 's subordinate and thus was banished from Eden by God himself ) and , much like the Greek striges , would prey on young babies and their mothers at night , as well as males . Because Hebrew law absolutely forbade the eating of human flesh or the drinking of any type of blood , Lilith 's blood drinking was described as exceptionally evil . To ward off attacks from Lilith , parents used to hang amulets around their child 's cradle . 
 An alternate version states the legend of Lilith / Lilitu ( and a type of spirit of the same name ) originally arose from Sumer , where she was described as an infertile " beautiful maiden " and was believed to be a harlot and vampire who , after having chosen a lover , would never let him go . Lilitu ( or the Lilitu spirits ) was considered to be an anthropomorphic bird @-@ footed , wind or night demon and was often described as a sexual predator who subsisted on the blood of babies and their mothers . Other Mesopotamian demons such as the Babylonian goddess Lamashtu , ( Sumer 's <unk> ) and Gallu of the <unk> group are mentioned as having vampiric natures . 
 Lamashtu is a historically older image that left a mark on the figure of Lilith . Many incantations invoke her as a malicious " Daughter of Heaven " or of Anu , and she is often depicted as a terrifying blood @-@ sucking creature with a lion 's head and the body of a donkey . Akin to Lilitu , Lamashtu primarily preyed on newborns and their mothers . She was said to watch pregnant women vigilantly , particularly when they went into labor . Afterwards , she would snatch the newborn from the mother to drink its blood and eat its flesh . In the <unk> texts she is described ; " Wherever she comes , wherever she appears , she brings evil and destruction . Men , beasts , trees , rivers , roads , buildings , she brings harm to them all . A flesh @-@ eating , bloodsucking monster is she . " Gallu was a demon closely associated with Lilith , though the word ( like " <unk> " ) is also used as a general term for demons , and these are " evil <unk> " or " evil Galli " . One incantation tells of them as spirits that threaten every house , rage at people , eat their flesh , and as they let their blood flow like rain , they never stop drinking blood . Lamashtu , Lilitu , and Gallu are invoked in different amulet texts , with Gallu showing up in Graeco @-@ Byzantine myth as <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> . There she appears as a child @-@ stealing and child @-@ killing female demon , in the manner of Lamia and Lilith . 
 = = = Ancient Greece = = = 
 Ancient Greek mythology contains several precursors to modern vampires , though none were considered undead ; these included the Empusa , Lamia , and striges ( the strix of Ancient Roman mythology ) . Over time the first two terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively . Empusa was the daughter of the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic , bronze @-@ footed creature . She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood . Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus . However Zeus ' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia 's offspring ; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night , sucking their blood . Like Lamia , the striges feasted on children , but also preyed on young men . They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general , and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix , a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood . The Romanian vampire breed named <unk> has no direct relation to the Greek striges , but was derived from the Roman term strix , as is the name of the Albanian <unk> and the Slavic <unk> , though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents . Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer 's epic Odyssey . In Homer 's tale , the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first . In the epic , when Odysseus journeyed into Hades , he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there could drink its blood and communicate . 
 = = = Ancient India = = = 
 In India , tales of <unk> , ghoul @-@ like beings that inhabit corpses , are found in old Sanskrit folklore . Although most <unk> legends have been compiled in the <unk> Pachisi , a prominent story in the Kathasaritsagara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one . The <unk> is described as an undead creature who , like the bat associated with modern @-@ day vampirism , hangs upside down on trees found on cremation grounds and cemeteries . <unk> , the returned spirits of evil @-@ doers or those who died insane , also bear vampiric attributes . 
 = = Medieval and early modern Europe = = 
 The 12th @-@ century English historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants , though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant . These tales are similar to the later folklore widely reported from Transylvania in the 18th century , which were the basis of the vampire legend that later entered Germany and England , where they were subsequently embellished and popularised . 
 During this time in the 18th century , there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in Transylvania , with frequent <unk> and grave diggings taking place to identify and kill the potential revenants ; even government officials were compelled into the hunting and staking of vampires . Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment , during which most folkloric legends were quelled , the belief in vampires increased dramatically , resulting in what could only be called a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe . The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734 , which spread to other localities . Two famous vampire cases , which were the first to be officially recorded , involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole from Serbia . Blagojevich was reported to have died at the age of 62 , but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food . When the son refused , he was found dead the following day . Blagojevich soon supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood . In the second case , Arnold Paole , an ex @-@ soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before , died while <unk> . After his death , people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Paole had returned to prey on the neighbours . 
 The two incidents were well @-@ documented : government officials examined the bodies , wrote case reports , and published books throughout Europe . The hysteria , which is commonly referred to as the " 18th @-@ Century Vampire Controversy " , raged for a generation . The problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so @-@ claimed vampire attacks , undoubtedly caused by the higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities , with locals digging up bodies and in some cases , staking them . Although many scholars reported during this period that vampires did not exist , and attributed reports to premature burial or rabies , superstitious belief continued to increase . Dom Augustine Calmet , a well @-@ respected French theologian and scholar , put together a comprehensive treatise in 1746 , which was ambiguous concerning the existence of vampires . Calmet amassed reports of vampire incidents ; numerous readers , including both a critical Voltaire and supportive demonologists , interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed . In his Philosophical Dictionary , Voltaire wrote : 
 These vampires were corpses , who went out of their graves at night to suck the blood of the living , either at their throats or stomachs , after which they returned to their cemeteries . The persons so sucked waned , grew pale , and fell into consumption ; while the sucking corpses grew fat , got rosy , and enjoyed an excellent appetite . It was in Poland , Hungary , Silesia , Moravia , Austria , and Lorraine , that the dead made this good cheer . 
 The controversy only ceased when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria sent her personal physician , Gerhard van Swieten , to investigate the claims of vampiric entities . He concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies , sounding the end of the vampire epidemics . Despite this condemnation , the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local superstition . 
 = = = Albania = = = 
 There are some vampire creatures in Albanian mythology . They include shtriga and dhampir . <unk> is a vampiric witch in traditional Albanian folklore that sucks the blood of infants at night while they sleep , and then turns into a flying insect ( traditionally a moth , fly or bee ) . Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained . The shtriga is often pictured as a woman with a hateful stare ( sometimes wearing a cape ) and a horribly disfigured face . The male noun for shtriga is <unk> or <unk> . Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga . A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday , rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave . They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass . She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim , the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it . If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth , it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga . 
 = = = Greece = = = 
 Bearing little resemblance to its Ancient Greek precursors , the modern Greek vrykolakas ( from a Slavic word meaning " werewolf " ) has much in common with the European vampire . Belief in vampires commonly called <unk> , vrykolakas , though also referred to as <unk> , <unk> , on Crete persisted throughout Greek history and became so widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries that many practices were enforced to both prevent and combat vampirism . The deceased were often exhumed from their graves after three years of death and the remains placed in a box by relatives ; wine was poured over them while a priest would read from scriptures . However , if the body had not sufficiently decayed , the corpse would be labeled a vrykolakas and dealt with appropriately . 
 In Greek folklore , vampirism could occur through various means : being excommunicated , desecrating a religious day , committing a great crime , or dying alone . Other causes included having a cat jump across one 's grave , eating meat from a sheep killed by a wolf , and being cursed . <unk> were usually thought to be indistinguishable from living people , giving rise to many folk tales with this theme . Crosses and <unk> ( blessed bread ) from the church were used as wards in different places . To prevent vampires from rising from the dead , their hearts were pierced with iron nails while resting in their graves , or their bodies burned and the ashes scattered . Because the Church opposed burning people who had received the <unk> of <unk> in the baptism ritual , cremation was considered a last resort . 
 = = = Hungary = = = 
 In Hungary , the belief in vampires has existed since the Middle Ages , and bloodthirsty creatures are mentioned all over the Inquisition 's notes . In the 12th century , Hungarian inquisitors interrogated a pagan shaman during a trial in the city of Sárospatak , who claimed the existence of a demon , which was called " <unk> " ( which means blood drinker ) . That demon was described as a wild entity that could eventually be called to destroy the enemies of the pagans . The Hungarian experts estimate that this word 's origin dates back to the period before the Hungarians ' arrival in Europe in 895 . The word has its roots in the ancient Turkish language , with which the Hungarians made contact during the late 8th century in the regions between Asia and Europe . 
 = = = Iceland = = = 
 The Icelandic <unk> ( plural draugar ) , is usually translated as " ghost " but unlike mainland ghosts Icelandic undead were believed to be corporeal . Icelandic scholars such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> Jakobsson have argued that the Icelandic draugur draugur has more in common with the eastern @-@ European vampire than it has with most beings categorized as ghosts . According to <unk> medieval Icelandic undead can be put into two categories . The first being " <unk> " or guardians , which are undead that stay in a certain place , usually their burial mound or home , and protect it and their treasures from thieves and trespassers . These draugar are depicted as being driven by greed and unwillingness to part with their worldy belongings and are in many way similar to dragons . The second category are " <unk> " ( A <unk> is a type of undead in Icelandic folklore , a human rib given life by drinking the blood of a witch and then sent out to steal milk and money . ) , parasitic ghosts who roam the earth and harass the living and try to drive them mad or even kill them , often by dragging them into their graves , and thereby turn their victims into more draugar . This comparison of Icelandic draugar to vampires is not entirely new as it was also made by Andrew Lang in 1897 when he called the draugur <unk> in Grettir 's Saga a vampire . There is also some similarity in the methods used to destroy draugar as those used against alleged vampires . Decapitation of the suspected corpse was common as was driving nails or sharp stakes into the body to pin it down or into the grave . 
 = = = Jewish traditions = = = 
 The Hebrew word " <unk> " ( literal translation is " leech " ) is synonymous with vampirism or vampires , as is " <unk> Dam " ( literally , " blood sucker " ) . Later vampire traditions appear among the European Jews of medieval Rhineland , in particular the medieval interpretation of Lilith . In common with vampires , this version of Lilith was held to be able to transform herself into an animal , usually a cat , and charm her victims into believing that she is benevolent or irresistible . However , she and her daughters usually strangle rather than drain victims , and in the Kabbalah , she retains many attributes found in vampires . A late 17th- or early 18th @-@ century Kabbalah document was found in one of the Ritman library 's copies of Jean de Pauly 's translation of the Zohar . The text contains two amulets , one for male ( <unk> ) , the other for female ( <unk> ) . The invocations on the amulets mention Adam , Eve , and Lilith , <unk> <unk> and the angels — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> 'el , and <unk> 'el . A few lines in Yiddish are shown as dialog between the prophet Elijah and Lilith , in which she has come with a host of demons to kill the mother , take her newborn and " to drink her blood , suck her bones and eat her flesh " . She informs Elijah that she will lose power if someone uses her secret names , which she reveals at the end . 
 Other Jewish stories depict vampires in a more traditional way . In " The Kiss of Death " , the daughter of the demon king <unk> snatches the breath of a man who has betrayed her , strongly reminiscent of a fatal kiss of a vampire . A rare story found in Sefer Hasidim # 1465 tells of an old vampire named <unk> who uses her hair to drain the blood from her victims . A similar tale from the same book describes staking a witch through the heart to ensure she does not come back from the dead to haunt her enemies . 
 = = = Romania = = = 
 Romanian vampires were known as <unk> ( from the Romanian word " mort " meaning " dead " or the Slavic word meaning " nightmare " ) and strigoi , with the latter classified as either living or dead . Live strigoi were described as living witches with two hearts or souls , sometimes both . <unk> were said to have the ability to send out their souls at night to meet with other strigoi and consume the blood of livestock and neighbours . Similarly , dead strigoi were described as reanimated corpses that also sucked blood and attacked their living family . Live strigoi became revenants after their death , but there were also many other ways of a person becoming a vampire . A person born with a caul , an extra nipple , a tail , or extra hair was doomed to become a vampire . The same fate applied to the seventh child in any family if all of his or her previous siblings were of the same sex , as well as someone born too early or someone whose mother had encountered a black cat crossing her path . If a pregnant woman did not eat salt or was looked upon by a vampire or a witch , her child would also become a vampire . So too would a child born out of wedlock . Others who were at risk of becoming vampires were those who died an unnatural death or before baptism . Finally , a person with red hair and blue eyes was seen as a potential strigoi . 
 Another type of Romanian vampire is <unk> . These types are humans born with a tail , and they can shape shift like a werewolf but they have control over their transformation . Their entire power is kept in their tail . In <unk> , the <unk> remain in their wolf form . 
 Romanian vampires were said to bite their victims over the heart or between the eyes , and sudden deaths could indicate the presence of a vampire . Graves were often opened five or seven years after burial and the corpse checked for vampirism , before being washed and reburied . 
 = = = Romani culture = = = 
 Among the Romani people , <unk> ( literally one who is dead ) are believed to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood , most often that of a relative or the person who had caused their death . Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased 's possessions instead of properly destroying them . Female vampires could return , lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite . Similar to other European beliefs , male vampires could father children , known as dhampirs , who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires . 
 Anyone who had a horrible appearance , was missing a finger , or had appendages similar to those of an animal was believed to be a vampire . A person who died alone and unseen would become a vampire , likewise if a corpse swelled or turned black before burial . Dogs , cats , plants or even agricultural tools could become vampires ; pumpkins or melons kept in the house too long would start to move , make noises or show blood . According to the late Serbian ethnologist <unk> <unk> , Roma people in Kosovo believed that vampires were invisible to most people , but could be seen by a twin brother and sister born on a Saturday who wore their clothes inside out . Likewise , a settlement could be protected by finding twins who could also see the vampire outdoors at night , who would have to flee immediately after they spotted it .

 The malign and succubus @-@ like <unk> <unk> from the Scottish Highlands and the <unk> <unk> of the Isle of Man , Scotland and Ireland are two fairy spirits with decidedly vampiric tendencies . Further Irish myths , alone or in combination , may have contributed to the storylines of Irish authors Sheridan Le Fanu and Bram Stoker : 
 The Dearg @-@ due ( literally " Red Blood Sucker " in Gaelic ) - a beautiful young woman who commits suicide when forced into a marriage and then rises from her grave to seek revenge by killing her father and husband . The <unk> of Portugal , which take the form of a bird at night and assail travellers , are other female vampiric spirits hostile to humans . 
 The legend of Droch @-@ fhola ( literally evil @-@ blood , and pronounced <unk> @-@ ola ) , and the Castle of Droch @-@ fhola ( Dún Droch @-@ fhola ) which guarded the <unk> Reeks Mountains of County Kerry 
 The legend of <unk> - an evil tyrant who repeatedly escapes his grave to spread terror ( and in some accounts to drink the blood of his subjects , to be one of the <unk> @-@ <unk> ( un @-@ dead ) , and to be killed only by with a sword of yew wood and to be buried upside @-@ down ) . 
 = = = Slavic Europe = = = 
 Some of the more common causes of vampirism in Slavic folklore include being a magician or an immoral person ; suffering an " unnatural " or untimely death such as suicide ; excommunication ; improper burial rituals ; an animal jumping or a bird flying over the corpse or the empty grave ( in Serbian folk belief ) ; and even being born with a caul , teeth , or tail , or being conceived on certain days . In southern Russia , people who were known to talk to themselves were believed to be at risk of becoming vampires . Slavic vampires were able to appear as butterflies , echoing an earlier belief of the butterfly symbolizing a departed soul . Some traditions spoke of " living vampires " or " people with two souls " , a kind of witch capable of leaving its body and engaging in harmful and vampiric activity while sleeping . 
 Among the beliefs of the East Slavs , those of the northern regions ( i.e. most of Russia ) are unique in that their undead , while having many of the features of the vampires of other Slavic peoples , do not drink blood and do not bear a name derived from the common Slavic root for " vampire " . Ukrainian and Belarusian legends are more " conventional " , although in Ukraine the vampires may sometimes not be described as dead at all , or may be seen as engaging in vampirism long before death . Ukrainian folklore also described vampires as having red faces and tiny tails . During cholera epidemics in the 19th century , there were cases of people being burned alive by their neighbours on charges of being vampires . 
 In South Slavic folklore , a vampire was believed to pass through several distinct stages in its development . The first 40 days were considered decisive for the making of a vampire ; it started out as an invisible shadow and then gradually gained strength from the blood it had sucked , forming a ( typically invisible ) jelly @-@ like , boneless mass , and eventually building up a human @-@ like body nearly identical to the one the person had had in life . This development allowed the creature to ultimately leave its grave and begin a new life as a human . The vampire , who was usually male , was also sexually active and could have children , either with his widow or a new wife . These could become vampires themselves , but could also have a special ability to see and kill vampires , allowing them to become vampire hunters . The same talent was believed to be found in persons born on Saturday . In the Dalmatian region of Croatia , there is a female vampire called a Mora or Morana , who drinks the blood of men , and also the <unk> / <unk> who are the recent @-@ dead " who have not lived piously . " They can be men or women who show themselves at crossroads , bridges , caves , and graveyards and frighten the locals by terrorizing their homes and drinking their blood . To be killed , a wooden stake must be thrust through them . In Croatia , Slovenia , the Czech Republic , and Slovakia , a type of vampire called <unk> , which literally translates to " drinker " , is used to describe a vampire who has led an evil and sinful life as a human and in turn , becomes a powerfully strong , cold @-@ blooded killer . Incest , especially between mother and son , is one of the ways in which a <unk> can be created , and then it usually comes back to <unk> its former family , who can only protect their homes by placing mashed garlic and wine at their windows and thresholds to keep it from entering . It can only be killed by fire while awake and by using the Rite of Exorcism if found in its grave during the day . In Bulgaria from the Middle Ages through to the beginning of the 20th Century , it was a common practice to pin corpses through the heart with an iron stake to prevent their return as a vampire . 
 To ward off the threat of vampires and disease , twin brothers would yoke twin oxen to a plow and make a furrow with it around their village . An egg would be broken and a nail driven into the floor beneath the bier of the house of a recently deceased person . Two or three elderly women would attend the cemetery the evening after the funeral and stick five hawthorn pegs or old knives into the grave : one at the position of the deceased 's chest , and the other four at the positions of his arms and legs . Other texts maintain that running backwards uphill with a lit candle and a turtle would ward off a stalking vampire . Alternately , they may surround the grave with a red woolen thread , ignite the thread , and wait until it was burnt up . If a noise was heard at night and suspected to be made by a vampire sneaking around someone 's house , one would shout " Come tomorrow , and I will give you some salt , " or " Go , pal , get some fish , and come back . " 
 One of the earliest recordings of vampire activity came from the region of Istria in modern Croatia , in 1672 . Local reports cited the local vampire <unk> <unk> of the village <unk> near <unk> as the cause of panic among the villagers . A former peasant , <unk> died in 1656 ; however , local villagers claimed he returned from the dead and began drinking blood from the people and sexually harassing his widow . The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart , but when the method failed to kill him , he was subsequently beheaded with better results .

 In Spain there are several traditions about beings with vampiric tendencies . In Asturias highlights the <unk> , which is described as an old vampire who sticks his single tooth and sucks the blood of its victims . Cantabria equivalent exists in the name <unk> . Catalonia is the legend of the Dip , an evil vampire dog . 
 In the Canary Islands there was also a belief in vampiric beings , here in the form of blood @-@ sucking witch . One such example is provided by the legend of the Witches of <unk> in Tenerife .

 Various regions of Africa have folkloric tales of beings with vampiric abilities : in West Africa the Ashanti people tell of the iron @-@ toothed and tree @-@ dwelling <unk> , and the Ewe people of the adze , which can take the form of a firefly and hunts children . The Eastern Cape region of South Africa has the <unk> , which can take the form of a large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning , and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the <unk> , an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail clippings of nobles .

 Female vampire @-@ like monsters are the <unk> of Trinidad , and the <unk> and <unk> of Colombian folklore , while the Mapuche of southern Chile have the bloodsucking snake known as the Peuchen . Aloe vera hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American superstition . Aztec mythology described tales of the <unk> , skeletal @-@ faced spirits of those who died in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living , driving them mad . 
 The Loogaroo is an example of how a vampire belief can result from a combination of beliefs , here a mixture of French and African <unk> or voodoo . The term Loogaroo possibly comes from the French loup @-@ <unk> ( meaning ' werewolf ' ) and is common in the culture of Mauritius . However , the stories of the Loogaroo are widespread through the Caribbean Islands and Louisiana in the United States . During the late 18th and 19th centuries , there was a widespread belief in vampires in parts of New England , particularly in Rhode Island and Eastern Connecticut . There are many documented cases of families <unk> loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family , although the term " vampire " was never actually used to describe the deceased . The deadly disease tuberculosis , or " consumption " as it was known at the time , was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves . The most famous , and most recently recorded , case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Mercy Brown , who died in Exeter , Rhode Island in 1892 . Her father , assisted by the family physician , removed her from her tomb two months after her death and her heart was cut out and burnt to ashes . 
 Among the Wyandots was the legend of the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> . A cross between what current fiction / legends portray as zombies and vampires , the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> was an evil spirit that inhabited recently dead bodies and caused the corpse to rise and devour the living . The redbud was believed to be an effective ward . 
 = = Asia = = 
 Rooted in older folklore , the modern belief in vampires spread throughout Asia with tales of ghoulish entities from the mainland , to vampiric beings from the islands of Southeast Asia . India also developed other vampiric legends . The <unk> or <unk> is the soul of a man who died an untimely death . It wanders around animating dead bodies at night , attacking the living much like a ghoul . In northern India , there is the <unk> , a vampire @-@ like creature with a head encircled by intestines and a skull from which it drank blood . Japan has no native legends about vampires . Japanese vampires made their first appearances in the Cinema of Japan during the late 1950s . 
 Legends of female vampire @-@ like beings who can detach parts of their upper body occur in the Philippines , Malaysia , Cambodia and Indonesia . There are two main vampire @-@ like creatures in the Philippines : the Tagalog mandurugo ( " blood @-@ sucker " ) and the Visayan manananggal ( " self @-@ <unk> " ) . The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that takes the form of an attractive girl by day , and develops wings and a long , hollow , thread @-@ like tongue by night . They use an elongated proboscis @-@ like tongue to suck fetuses off pregnant women . They also prefer to eat entrails ( specifically the heart and the liver ) and the phlegm of sick people . The manananggal is described as being an older , beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat @-@ like wings and prey on unsuspecting , sleeping pregnant women in their homes . The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim . 
 The Malaysian Penanggalan may be either a beautiful old or young woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means , and is most commonly described in local folklores to be dark or demonic in nature . She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood , typically from pregnant women . Malaysians would hang <unk> ( thistles ) around the doors and windows of houses , hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns . The <unk> is a similar being from Balinese folklore . A Pontianak , <unk> or <unk> in Indonesia , or <unk> in Malaysia , is a woman who died during childbirth and became undead , seeking revenge and terrorizing villages . She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck , which she sucked the blood of children with . Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off . Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads , eggs under each armpit , and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming <unk> . 
 In Cambodia , the Ab ( Khmer : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , similar to the Penanggalan is either a young or an old woman which detaches her head at night through windows of houses looking for lungs , hearts and blood of dead or alive animals and returns to her body in the day . Married Abs go to bed quickly and starts detaching their heads . Most of them do not allow anyone to go into the room and their husbands are afraid of them , some might even run away from the house . In movies , women turn into abs through a special holy water but according to local legends it is passed through heredity . Abs are considered to be afraid of humans but will run after them if they are afraid of her . She might get her intestines stuck into thorns . The Abs like a river go along a certain path and remembers it very carefully . 
 Jiangshi , sometimes called " Chinese vampires " by Westerners , are corpses that are usually reanimated due to magical reasons . In ancient China , people always had the preference of being buried in their hometowns , and when a person dies in a land that is not their hometown , their family members hire a sorcerer to bring back their deceased family member . The family commissions the sorcerer in their village to travel to the place of the person 's death , locate the corpse , and to write a spell and stick it upon the corpses 's face , in which the spell @-@ paper contains their name , birthdate , and some other words to reanimate the corpse . Once the paper is stuck upon the corpses 's face , the newly created jiangshi would follow the sorcerer by hopping around , in which the sorcerer would lead it back to its hometown for burial ( this was often a last @-@ resort choice used by families with not enough money to hire a cart to carry the corpse back ) . Usually , the sorcerer would travel by night , and would at least have around three jiangshi traveling with it . But when the written spell @-@ paper falls or is pulled off of the jiangshi ( in the case the sorcerer is not paid the agreed amount for his doings , he might rip off the jiangshi 's spell @-@ paper ) , it gains its own consciousness , and all the power that the sorcerer formerly had over it would be lost . Instead of being an obedient corpse that followed the sorcerer , the jiangshi would be rampant and dangerous . The freed jiangshi would begin killing living creatures to absorb life essence ( qì ) from their victims . They are said to be created when a person 's soul ( 魄 <unk> ) fails to leave the deceased 's body . 
 Some unusual features of the Chinese vampire include its long , curved fingernails , perhaps derived from the appearance of growing fingernails on corpses due to flesh recession , and its greenish @-@ white furry skin , perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses . Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia . Films like Encounters of the Spooky Kind and Mr. Vampire were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s . 
 In Sri Lanka the belief of Riri Yaka ( Blood Demon ) can be found . According to mythology , he tore his mother 's breast and emerged into the human world as a demon killing her . The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations . In most cases he is said to be a giant who towers over his human victims . In the primary form , his face is blue and splotched with blood . Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes . Blood pours from his nostrils and smoke billows from his ears . His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul . His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood . He is closely associated with Mara , the demon king of death . 
 = Implosion of Radio Network House = 
 The implosion of Radio Network House on 5 August 2012 was New Zealand 's first ever controlled building demolition by explosives . Like most other buildings in the Christchurch Central City , Radio Network House was damaged beyond repair in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake , and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority ( CERA ) added it to the demolition list in August 2011 . In July 2012 , it was announced that the building was going to be imploded , involving a specialist company from America with a large track record for this type of work . The right to push the button for the implosion was put up for auction on the TradeMe website , and became the auction with the third highest page views ever . The winning bid of NZ $ 26 @,@ 000 was made by a consortium of demolition contractors , who allowed the Child Cancer Foundation to nominate a six @-@ year @-@ old boy from Queenstown to trigger the event . The implosion , which was carefully monitored to assess the suitability of this approach for potential future applications , went without any problems and it is anticipated that this will have paved the way for many more implosions in New Zealand in general , and in Christchurch in particular . 
 = = Background = = 
 Radio Network House was a 14 @-@ storey office tower constructed in 1986 . The building was located at 155 Worcester Street , on the north side of the street and in the block between Manchester Street and Latimer Square . For its last twelve years Radio Network House was owned by Greg Hedges through his company Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd . 
 The building was first operated as the Christchurch studio for Television New Zealand ( TVNZ ) , who displayed their logo on the building . Shows such as What Now , After School , Simon Barnett 's quiz show Face the Music and later The Son of a Gunn Show were filmed in the tower block . TVNZ vacated the building in late 1998 following a decision to move all of their Christchurch @-@ produced shows to Wellington . In the late 1990s , Telstra New Zealand , the telecommunications company of Telstra in New Zealand , owned the naming rights to the building . After Clear Communications was acquired in December 2001 to form <unk> , the Clear logo was prominently displayed on the building . The building 's naming rights were sold to The Radio Network and it was renamed to Radio Network House during the ownership of Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd . At the time of demolition the logo of Newstalk ZB , a subsidiary of The Radio Network , was displayed on the building . 
 The Canterbury region was hit by a series of earthquakes , and the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake damaged the office building beyond repair . About 400 people worked in the building before the earthquakes . Following the earthquakes , the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority ( CERA ) was set up to manage the recovery process . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 On 30 August 2011 , CERA added Radio Network House to the list of buildings to be demolished . On 17 July 2012 , the local Canterbury newspaper The Press reported that implosion of Radio Network House had been approved by CERA . The same day , a press conference was held , where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media . The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love , who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion . Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition , Inc . , an American company based in Phoenix , Maryland , that has a track record of 9 @,@ 000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field . The implosion of Radio Network House was a test case , as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before , and there are still many more tall buildings to be demolished in Christchurch . The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition , Inc . , as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with . 
 Before demolition , buildings are stripped of their contents , including internal plasterboard linings . As the fees for dumping demolition waste have risen since the earthquakes , it is more economical for demolition contractors to produce ' clean ' demolition material . Holes were drilled into support columns of the building and filled with a total of some 60 kilograms ( 130 lb ) of explosives , which when set off , would destroy the support structure and cause the collapse of the building . A challenge for the demolition contractor was that explosives available in New Zealand are low @-@ velocity and low @-@ energy . 
 A representative from Ceres stated that the implosion would shorten the demolition process by some six weeks and would save money . Costs were around NZ $ 1m for the implosion , compared to some NZ $ 1.2m for a conventional demolition , with the owner 's building insurance covering the costs . The owner of the building , however , stated that the implosion was not a cheaper option for his company than a conventional demolition , but it " would save others thousands " . He likened the consent process to Christopher Columbus wanting to sail to America , with everybody telling him that it could not be done . 
 The owner of the Westende building , on the corner of Manchester and Worcester Street and some 80 metres ( 260 ft ) away from Radio Network House , threatened to seek a court injunction against the implosion . He raised concerns about potential seismic activity , possible damage to his new building , and noxious contaminants transferred by dust . The original Westende building had been destroyed in the first earthquake in 2010 and was one of the very few new buildings in the centre of Christchurch to have been rebuilt already . The concerns were dismissed by the demolition contractors and the threatened court action did not eventuate . 
 = = Auction = = 
 Soon after the announcement was made that the implosion had been approved , it was reported that the demolition contractors considered putting the right to push the button for the implosion up for auction , with the proceeds going to charity . " I 've seen them go for $ 6 @,@ 000 " is how one of the company representatives was quoted , but the issue of liability needed to be worked through . The auction was set up on the internet auction website TradeMe and went live on Tuesday , 24 July , at 11 am . It was set up with a $ 1 reserve ( meaning that theoretically , the right to push the button could have been sold for just $ 1 ) . The auction was hugely popular and within one hour , bidding had reached $ 6 @,@ 000 . Bidding reached $ 30 @,@ 000 , but some bids were considered illegitimate and TradeMe staff removed them , and in other cases , bidders themselves requested to be removed . 
 When the auction closed , it had received the third highest number of viewers of TradeMe auctions ever , at 459 @,@ 420 views . The winning bid was $ 26 @,@ 000 , placed by a consortium of seven demolition contractors who currently undertake demolitions in the Christchurch Central City ( D Construction , Dormer Construction , Jurgens Demolition , March Construction , Pro Tranz Contracting and <unk> Developments , Shilton and Brown Demolition , and Ward 's Demolition ) . They gave the right to choose a person to push the button to the Child Cancer Foundation , who nominated a six @-@ year @-@ old boy from Queenstown . 
 The charity chosen to receive the proceeds of the auction was the Canterbury Earthquake Heritage Buildings Fund , who passed the funds to the Isaac Theatre Royal in Gloucester Street , a heritage building registered as Category I by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust . The Government of New Zealand pledged to match donations towards the restoration of heritage buildings dollar for dollar , so the final amount received by the Isaac Theatre Royal was NZ $ 52 @,@ 000 .

 The demolition companies involved appealed to the public on the day prior to the implosion to stay away for health and safety reasons , and watch the proceedings on TV or the internet . Several television stations had live streams of the event , and The Press announced that they would post a video on their website shortly after the implosion . An exclusion zone was put in place to ensure that nobody would be within approximately 200 metres ( 660 ft ) of the building . 
 Despite the appeal , thousands of onlookers filled the street on Sunday morning of 5 August . <unk> at 8 am , a series of short explosions were heard , followed by another series a couple of seconds later . The building collapsed towards the north as planned , and the implosion manager from Controlled Demolition , Inc. was quoted as saying that " it went a bit further than I had hoped so I am lucky " . The explosions were heard around Christchurch . 
 One of CERA 's objectives in approving the implosion was to find out how the soil behaved , as Radio Network House was built on one of the worst soils in Christchurch . <unk> readings showed ground velocity of 12 mm / s , which is comparable to a large truck slowly driving across the demolition site . With any residual concerns about the performance of poor soils during building implosions removed , it will be much easier for other building owners to obtain consent from CERA . Further implosions are likely , with a representative from Controlled Demolition , Inc. describing the Christchurch market as a " target @-@ rich environment " . The Christchurch Central Police Station is the second building earmarked for implosion in early 2015 . 
 The implosion attracted global attention , with media in Australia , Canada , Ireland , South Africa and the United States covering the event . 
 = Emilia Plater = 
 Countess Emilia Plater ( <unk> @-@ Plater , Lithuanian : <unk> <unk> ) ( 13 November 1806 – 23 December 1831 ) was a Polish noblewoman and revolutionary from the lands of the partitioned Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . Raised in a patriotic Polish tradition , she fought in the November 1830 Uprising , during which she raised a small unit , participated in several engagements , and received the rank of captain in the Polish insurgent forces . Near the end of the Uprising , she fell ill and died . 
 Though she did not participate in any major engagement , her story became widely publicized and inspired a number of works of art and literature . She is a national heroine in Poland and Lithuania , all formerly parts of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth . She has been venerated by Polish artists and by the nation at large as a symbol of women fighting for the national cause . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Emilia Plater was born in Vilnius ( Wilno ) into a noble Polish – Lithuanian Plater family . Her family , of the Plater coat of arms , traced its roots to Westphalia , but was thoroughly Polonized . Much of the family relocated to Livonia during the 15th century and later to Lithuania , of which Vilnius is the capital . She is described as either Polish , Polish @-@ Lithuanian or Lithuanian . 
 Her parents , Franciszek Ksawery Plater and Anna von der Mohl ( Anna z <unk> ) , divorced when she was nine years old , in 1815 . She was brought up by distant relatives , Michał Plater @-@ <unk> and Izabela Helena <unk> zu <unk> , in their family 's manor <unk> near Daugavpils ( <unk> ) , then Inflanty ( now Latvia ) . Well @-@ educated , Plater was brought up to appreciate the efforts of Tadeusz Kościuszko and the Prince Józef Poniatowski . She was fascinated by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller , who she could read in the original German language . She was raised in an environment that valued the history of Poland , and her literary heroes included Princess Wanda and Adam Mickiewicz 's Grażyna . She also admired <unk> , a woman who became one of the icons of the Greek uprising against the Ottomans , a Polish fighter Anna <unk> <unk> , as well as Joan of Arc . These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in equestrianism and marksmanship , quite uncommon for early 19th @-@ century girls from aristocratic families . She was also deeply interested in the Ruthenian and Belarusian folk culture . She had contacts and friends in the Filaret Association . 
 In 1823 , one of her cousins was forcibly conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army as a punishment for celebrating the Constitution of 3 May ; this incident is said to be one of the key events in her life , and one that galvanized her pro @-@ Polish and anti @-@ Russian attitude . In 1829 , Plater began a grand tour throughout the historical Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , visiting Warsaw and Kraków , and the battlefield of Raszyn . Her mother died a year later ; her father remarried and refused to even meet his daughter . After the outbreak of the November Uprising against Imperial Russia , she became a vocal supporter of the anti @-@ Tsarist sentiments in the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania . She became one of a dozen or so females to join the Uprising , and the most famous of them all . 
 = = = Uprising = = = 
 A document from 25 March contains her note that joining the uprising was her sole idea , and that she had hoped that such a moment would come her entire life . She cut her hair , prepared a uniform for herself and organized and equipped a group of volunteers , speaking passionately after a mass on 29 March . On 4 April she signed a declaratory document marking her access to the local uprising forces . Her unit was composed of roughly 280 infantry , 60 cavalry and several hundred peasants armed with war scythes . 
 From the area of Daugavpils she entered Lithuania , where in April 1831 her unit is rumored to have seized the town of <unk> ( <unk> ) , although the historians are not sure this event really occurred . She planned to take Daugavpils , but after a reconnaissance mission discovered that the city was defended by a strong garrison and was impregnable to attack by such a small force as her own unit , that plan was abandoned . She then returned to Samogitia and headed for <unk> ( <unk> ) , where on 30 April she joined forces with the unit commanded by Karol Załuski . On May 4 , she fought at the battle of <unk> ( <unk> ) ; shortly afterwards , with Konstanty <unk> , she fought at <unk> ( <unk> ) . On 5 May , she witnessed General <unk> Chłapowski entering the area with a large force and taking command over all units fighting in the former Grand Duchy . 
 Chłapowski advised Plater to stand down and return home . She allegedly replied that she had no intention of taking off her uniform until her fatherland was fully liberated . Her decision was accepted and she was made a commanding officer of the 1st company of the Polish – Lithuanian 25th Infantry Regiment . She was promoted to the rank of captain , the highest rank awarded to a woman at that time . She spent some time in Kaunas ( Kowno ) , before the insurgents were forced to retreat in late June . 
 After the Polish units were defeated by the Russians at Šiauliai ( <unk> ) , Gen. Chłapowski decided to cross the border into Prussia and become interned there . Plater vocally criticized that decision , refused to follow orders and instead decided to try to break through to Warsaw and continue the struggle . However , soon after separating from the main force , accompanied by only two others , including her cousin ( or uncle , sources vary ) , <unk> Plater , she became seriously ill . She never recovered , and she died in a manor of the <unk> family in <unk> ( <unk> ) on 23 December 1831 . She was buried in the small village of Kapčiamiestis ( <unk> ) near Lazdijai ( <unk> ) . After the defeat of the uprising , her estate was confiscated by the Russian authorities . 
 Stefan <unk> , in a more critical treatment in the Polish Biographical Dictionary , notes that a lot of her exploits are poorly documented , and it is not always possible to separate legend from facts . He notes it is not certain she ever commanded any unit , and that her role as the commander of the 25th Regiment was more honorary than real ; he also notes that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield , distracting her comrades , and in at least one instance ( at the battle of Šiauliai ) , she was purposefully held behind front lines , as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Her death was widely publicised shortly afterwards by the Polish press , which contributed to her growing fame . Plater became one of the symbols of the uprising . The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland , Lithuania and abroad . Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem , Śmierć <unk> ( Death of a Colonel ) , although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life . Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills , portraying her as the ideal commander , worshiped by her soldiers . That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland . 
 Other literary works based on her life were published , mostly abroad , both by Polish emigres and by foreigners . Among them were Georg Büchner , Konstanty <unk> , Wacław <unk> , Tadeusz <unk> , Antoni Edward <unk> and Władysław Buchner . Józef <unk> published three successive versions of her biography in French . 
 She also became the theme of paintings by several artists of the epoch , among them <unk> <unk> , Achille <unk> , Philipp Veit , Francois de Villain and Wojciech Kossak . In 1842 , J. K. <unk> published a short biography of Plater in New York , under the title of Emily Plater , The Polish Heroine ; Life of the Countess Emily Plater . A lithograph by F. De <unk> , based on <unk> 's work , became one of the most recognizable portraits of her , popularizing her image as a delicate and noble female warrior . 
 She was depicted on the Second Polish Republic 's 20 złoty note . During World War II , a Polish female support unit , Emilia Plater 1st Independent Women 's Battalion ( 1 <unk> Battalion <unk> im . <unk> Plater ) , a part of the Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division was named in her honor ; its former members founded a village of <unk> in Lower Silesia . Several streets in Poland are named after her , including one in Warsaw . In 1959 , the MS Emilia Plater , a Polish Merchant Navy bulk carrier , was named after her . 
 Her life has also been a subject to studies from a feminist perspective , by scholars to point out the significance of her participation in the military conflict as a female going against the stereotype that only males can fight . 
 = Thomas Brassey = 
 Thomas Brassey ( 7 November 1805 – 8 December 1870 ) was an English civil engineering contractor and manufacturer of building materials who was responsible for building much of the world 's railways in the 19th century . By 1847 , he had built about one @-@ third of the railways in Britain , and by time of his death in 1870 he had built one in every twenty miles of railway in the world . This included three @-@ quarters of the lines in France , major lines in many other European countries and in Canada , Australia , South America and India . He also built the structures associated with those railways , including docks , bridges , viaducts , stations , tunnels and drainage works . 
 As well as railway engineering , Brassey was active in the development of steamships , mines , locomotive factories , marine telegraphy , and water supply and sewage systems . He built part of the London sewerage system , still in operation today , and was a major shareholder in Brunel 's The Great Eastern , the only ship large enough at the time to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable across the North Atlantic , in 1864 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Brassey family traced themselves back to a Norman ancestor from the town of <unk> in Lower Normandy who crossed to England with William the Conqueror in 1066 . Initially their home was at Bulkeley , near Malpas in Cheshire , where they lived for nearly 600 years . At some time , and certainly by 1663 , the family moved to Manor Farm in <unk> , a small settlement in the parish of Aldford , 6 miles ( 10 km ) south of Chester . Thomas Brassey was the eldest son of John Brassey , a prosperous farmer , and his wife Elizabeth . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Thomas Brassey was educated at home until the age of 12 , when he was sent to The King 's School in Chester . Aged 16 , he became an articled apprentice to a land surveyor and agent , William Lawton . Lawton was the agent of Francis Richard Price of Overton , Flintshire . During the time Brassey was an apprentice he helped to survey the new Shrewsbury to Holyhead road ( this is now the A5 ) , assisting the surveyor of the road . While he was engaged in this work he met the engineer for the road , Thomas Telford . When his apprenticeship ended at the age of 21 , Brassey was taken into partnership by Lawton , forming the firm of " Lawton and Brassey " . Brassey moved to Birkenhead where their business was established . Birkenhead at that time was a very small place ; in 1818 it consisted of only four houses . The business flourished and grew , extending into areas beyond land surveying . At the Birkenhead site a brickworks and lime kilns were built . The business either owned or managed sand and stone quarries in Wirral . Amongst other ventures , the firm supplied the bricks for building the custom house for the port which was developing in the town . Many of the bricks needed for the growing city of Liverpool were supplied by the brickworks and Brassey devised new methods of transporting his materials , including a system similar to the modern method of <unk> , and using a gravity train to take materials from the quarry to the port . When Lawton died , Brassey became sole manager of the company and sole agent and representative for Francis Price . It was during these years that he gained the basic experience for his future career . 
 = = Early contracts in Britain = = 
 Brassey 's first experiences of civil engineering were the construction of 4 miles ( 6 km ) of the New Chester Road at Bromborough , and the building of a bridge at Saughall Massie , on the Wirral . During that time he met George Stephenson , who needed stone to build the Sankey Viaduct on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . Stephenson and Brassey visited a quarry in <unk> , a village near Birkenhead , following which Stephenson advised Brassey to become involved in building railways . Brassey 's first venture into railways was to submit a tender for building the Dutton Viaduct on the Grand Junction Railway , but he lost the contract to William Mackenzie , who had submitted a lower bid . In 1835 Brassey submitted a tender for building the Penkridge Viaduct , further south on the same railway , between Stafford and Wolverhampton , together with 10 miles ( 16 km ) of track . The tender was accepted , the work was successfully completed , and the viaduct opened in 1837 . Initially the engineer for the line was George Stephenson , but he was replaced by Joseph Locke , Stephenson 's pupil and assistant . During this time Brassey moved to Stafford . Penkridge viaduct still stands and carries trains on the West Coast Main Line . 
 On completion of the Grand Junction Railway , Locke moved on to design part of the London and Southampton Railway and encouraged Brassey to submit a tender , which was accepted . Brassey undertook work on the section of the railway between Basingstoke and Winchester , and on other parts of the line . The following year Brassey won contracts to build the Chester and Crewe Railway with Robert Stephenson as engineer and , with Locke as the engineer , the Glasgow , Paisley and Greenock Railway and the Sheffield and Manchester Railway . 
 = = Early contracts in France = = 
 Following the success of the early railways in Britain , the French were encouraged to develop a railway network , in the first place to link with the railway system in Britain . To this end the Paris and Rouen Railway Company was established , and Locke was appointed as its engineer . He considered that the tenders submitted by French contractors were too expensive , and suggested that British contractors should be invited to tender . In the event only two British contractors took the offer seriously , Brassey and William Mackenzie . Instead of trying to outbid each other they tendered jointly , and their tender was accepted in 1841 . This set a pattern for Brassey , who from then on worked in partnership with other contractors in most of his ventures . Between 1841 and 1844 Brassey and Mackenzie won contracts to build four French railways , with a total mileage of 437 miles ( 703 km ) , the longest of which was the 294 @-@ mile ( 473 km ) Orléans and Bordeaux Railway . Following the French revolution of 1848 there was a financial crisis in the country and investment in the railways almost ceased . This meant that Brassey had to seek foreign contracts elsewhere . 
 = = = The collapse of the <unk> viaduct = = = 
 In January 1846 , during the building of the 58 @-@ mile ( 93 km ) long Rouen and Le Havre line , one of the few major structural disasters of Brassey 's career occurred , the collapse of the <unk> Viaduct . The viaduct was built of brick at a cost of about £ 50 @,@ 000 and was 100 feet ( 30 m ) high . The reason for the collapse was never established , but a possible cause was the nature of the lime used to make the mortar . The contract stipulated that this had to be obtained locally , and the collapse occurred after a few days of heavy rain . Brassey rebuilt the viaduct at his own expense , this time using lime of his own choice . The rebuilt viaduct still stands and is in use today . 
 = = " Railway mania " = = 
 During the time Brassey was building the early French railways , Britain was experiencing what was known as the " railway mania " , when there was massive investment in the railways . Large numbers of lines were being built , but not all of them were built to Brassey 's high standards . Brassey was involved in this expansion but was careful to choose his contracts and investors so that he could maintain his standards . During the one year of 1845 he agreed no less than nine contracts in England , Scotland and Wales , with a mileage totalling over 340 miles ( 547 km ) . In 1844 Brassey and Locke began building the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway of 70 miles ( 113 km ) , which was considered to be one of their greatest lines . It passed through the Lune Valley and then over Shap Fell . Its summit was 916 feet ( 279 m ) high and the line had steep gradients , the maximum being 1 in 75 . To the south the line linked by way of the Preston – Lancaster line to the Grand Junction Railway . Two important contracts undertaken in 1845 were the Trent Valley Railway of 50 miles ( 80 km ) and the Chester and Holyhead line of 84 miles ( 135 km ) . The former line joined the London and Birmingham Railway at Rugby to the Grand Junction Railway south of Stafford providing a line from London to Scotland which bypassed Birmingham . The latter line provided a link between London and the ferries sailing from Holyhead to Ireland and included Robert Stephenson 's tubular Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait . Also in 1845 Brassey received contracts for the Caledonian Railway which linked the railway at Carlisle with Glasgow and Edinburgh , covering a total distance of 125 miles ( 201 km ) and passing over Beattock Summit . His engineer on this project was George Heald . That same year he also began contracts for other railways in Scotland , and in 1846 he started building parts of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway between Hull and Liverpool , across the Pennines . 
 A contract for the Great Northern Railway was agreed in 1847 , with William Cubitt as engineer @-@ in @-@ chief , although much of the work was done by William 's son Joseph , who was the resident engineer . Brassey was the sole contractor for the line of 75 @.@ 5 miles ( 122 km ) . A particular problem was met in the marshy country of The Fens in providing a firm foundation for the railway and associated structures . Brassey was assisted in solving the problem by one of his agents , Stephen Ballard . Rafts or platforms were made of layers of faggot @-@ wood and peat sods . As these sank , they dispersed the water and so a firm foundation was made . This line is still in use and forms part of the East Coast Main Line . Also in 1847 Brassey began to build the North Staffordshire Railway . By this time the " railway mania " was coming to an end and contracts in Britain were becoming increasingly more difficult to find . By the end of the " railway mania " , Brassey had built one @-@ third of all the railways in Britain . 
 = = Expansion in Europe = = 
 Following the end of the " railway mania " and the drying up of contracts in France , Brassey could have retired as a rich man . Instead he decided to expand his interests , initially in other European countries . His first venture in Spain was the Barcelona and Mataró Railway of 18 miles ( 29 km ) in 1848 . In 1850 he undertook his first contract in the Italian States , a short railway of 10 miles ( 16 km ) , the Prato and Pistoia Railway . This was to lead to bigger contracts in Italy , the next being the Turin – Novara line of 60 miles ( 97 km ) in 1853 , followed by the Central Italian Railway of 52 miles ( 84 km ) . In Norway , with Sir Morton Peto and Edward Betts , Brassey built the Oslo to Bergen Railway of 56 miles ( 90 km ) which passes through inhospitable terrain and rises to nearly 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 829 m ) . In 1852 he resumed work in France with the Mantes and Caen Railway of 133 miles ( 214 km ) and , in 1854 , the Caen and Cherbourg Railway of 94 miles ( 151 km ) . The Dutch were relatively slow to start building railways but in 1852 with Locke as engineer , Brassey built the Dutch Rhenish Railway of 43 miles ( 69 km ) . Meanwhile , he continued to build lines in England , including the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway of 51 miles ( 82 km ) , the Hereford , Ross and Gloucester Railway of 50 miles ( 80 km ) , the London , Tilbury and Southend Railway of 50 miles ( 80 km ) and the North Devon Railway from Minehead to Barnstaple of 47 miles ( 76 km ) . 
 = = The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada = = 
 In 1852 Brassey took out the largest contract of his career , which was to build the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada . This line passed from Quebec , along the valley of the Saint Lawrence River , and then to the north of Lake Ontario to Toronto . The line totalled 539 miles ( 867 km ) in length . The consulting engineer for the project was Robert Stephenson and the company 's engineer for the whole undertaking was Alexander Ross . Brassey worked in partnership with Peto , Betts and Sir William Jackson . The line crossed the river at Montreal by the Victoria Bridge . This was a tubular bridge designed by Robert Stephenson and was the longest bridge in the world at the time , measuring some 1 @.@ 75 miles ( 3 km ) . The bridge opened in 1859 and the formal opening ceremony was carried out the following year by the Prince of Wales . The construction of the line caused considerable problems . The main problem was the raising of the necessary finance and at one stage Brassey travelled to Canada to appeal personally for assistance . Other difficulties arose from the severity of the Canadian winter , the waterways being frozen for around six months each year , and resistance from Canadian businessmen . The line was an engineering success but a financial failure , with the contractors losing £ 1 million . 
 = = = The Canada Works = = = 
 The contract for the Grand Trunk Railway included all the materials required for building the bridge and the railway , including the rolling stock . To manufacture the metallic components , Brassey built a new factory in Birkenhead which he called The Canada Works . A suitable site was found by George Harrison , Brassey 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , and the factory was built with a quay alongside to take ocean @-@ going ships . The works was managed by George Harrison with a Mr. Alexander and William Heap as assistants . The machine shop was 900 feet ( 274 m ) in length and included a blacksmiths ' shop with 40 furnaces , anvils and steam hammers , a <unk> ' shop , and fabrication , woodwork and pattern shops . There was also a well @-@ stocked library and a reading room for all the workforce . 
 The fitting shop was designed to manufacture 40 locomotives a year and a total of 300 were produced in the next eight years . The first locomotive , given its trial in May 1854 , was named Lady Elgin , after the wife of the Governor General of Canada of the time , the Earl of Elgin . For the bridge hundreds of thousands of components were required and all were manufactured in Birkenhead or in other English factories to Brassey 's specifications . These were all stamped and coded , loaded into ships to be taken to Quebec and then by rail to the site of the bridge for assembly . The central tube of the bridge contained over 10 @,@ 000 pieces of iron , perforated by holes for half a million rivets , and when it was assembled every piece and hole was true . 
 = = The Grand Crimean Central Railway = = 
 Brassey played a part in helping the English forces to success in the Crimean War . The Black Sea port of Sevastopol was held by the Russians . The British government , in alliance with the French and the Turks , sent an army of 30 @,@ 000 to Balaclava , another port in a neighbouring bay of the Black Sea , from which to attack Sevastopol . Sevastopol was besieged in September 1854 by the British and allied forces . It was hoped that the siege would be short but with the coming of winter the conditions were appalling and it was proving difficult to transport clothing , food , medical supplies and weaponry from Balaclava to the front . When news of the problem arrived in Britain , Brassey joined with Peto and Betts in offering to build a railway at cost to transport these necessary supplies . They shipped out the equipment and materials for building the railway , which had been intended for other undertakings , together with an army of navvies to carry out the work . Within seven weeks , in severe winter conditions , the railway from Balaclava to the troops besieging Sevastopol was completed . It then became possible to move supplies easily to the front and Sevastopol was finally taken in September 1855 . 
 = = Worldwide expansion = = 
 In addition to building more railways in Britain and in other European countries , Brassey undertook contracts in other continents . In South America his railways totalled 250 miles ( 402 km ) , in Australia 132 miles ( 212 km ) , and in India and Nepal 506 miles ( 814 km ) . 
 In 1866 there was a great economic slump , caused by the collapse of the bank of Overend , Gurney and Company , and many of Brassey 's colleagues and competitors became insolvent . However , despite setbacks , Brassey survived the crisis and drove ahead with the projects he already had in hand . These included the Lemberg and <unk> Railway in Austria which continued to be constructed despite the Austro @-@ Prussian War which was taking place in the locality . 
 From 1867 Brassey 's health was beginning to decline , but he continued to negotiate further contracts , including the <unk> and <unk> Railway in the Austrian Empire . In 1868 he suffered a mild stroke but he continued to work and in April 1869 he embarked on an extensive tour of over 5 @,@ 000 miles ( 8 @,@ 000 km ) in Eastern Europe . By the time of his death he had built one mile in every twenty miles of railway in the world . 
 = = Non @-@ railway contracts = = 
 Brassey 's works were not limited to railways and associated structures . In addition to his factories in Birkenhead , he built an engineering works in France to supply materials for his contracts there . He built a number of drainage systems , and a waterworks at Calcutta . Brassey built docks at Greenock , Birkenhead , Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness and London . His London docks were the Victoria Docks which had a water area of over 100 acres ( 40 ha ) . The contract for this was agreed in 1852 in partnership with Peto and Betts and the docks were opened in 1857 . Also included in the contract were warehouses and wine vaults totalling an area of about 25 acres ( 10 ha ) . The dockside machinery was worked by hydraulic power supplied by William Armstrong . The dock had links to Brassey 's London , Tilbury and Southend Railway and thereby to the entire British rail system . 
 In 1861 Brassey built part of the London sewerage system for Joseph Bazalgette . This was a stretch of the Metropolitan Mid Level Sewer of 12 miles ( 19 km ) which started at Kensal Green , passed under Bayswater Road , Oxford Street and Clerkenwell to the River Lea . It was one of the earliest ventures to use steam cranes . The undertaking was considered to have been one of Brassey 's most difficult . The sewer is still in operation today . He also worked with Bazalgette to build the Victoria Embankment on the north bank of the River Thames from Westminster Bridge to Blackfriars Bridge . 
 Brassey gave financial help to Brunel to build his ship The Leviathan , which was later called The Great Eastern and which in 1854 was six times larger than any other vessel in the world . Brassey was a major shareholder in the ship and after Brunel 's death , he , together with Gooch and Barber , bought the ship for the purpose of laying the first Transatlantic telegraph cable across the North Atlantic in 1864 . 
 Brassey had other ideas which were ahead of his time . He tried to interest the governments of the United Kingdom and Europe in the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel but this came to nothing . He also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Darién ( now the Isthmus of Panama ) but this idea similarly had no success . 
 = = Working methods = = 
 In most of Brassey 's contracts he worked in partnership with other contractors , in particular with Peto and Betts . The planning of the details of the projects was done by the engineers . Sometimes there would be a consulting engineer and below him another engineer who was in charge of the day @-@ to @-@ day activities . During his career Brassey worked with many engineers , the most illustrious being Robert Stephenson , Joseph Locke and Isambard Kingdom Brunel . The day @-@ to @-@ day work was overseen by agents , who managed and controlled the activities of the subcontractors . 
 The actual work was done by labourers , in those days known as navvies , supervised by gangers ( or foremen ) . In the early days the navvies were mainly English and many of them had formerly worked on building the canals . They were later joined by men from Scotland , Wales and Ireland . The number of Irish workers particularly increased following the potato famine . Brassey paid his navvies and gangers a wage and provided food , clothing , shelter and , in some projects , a lending library . On overseas contracts local labour would be used if it were available , but the work was often done or supplemented by British workers . The agent on the site had overall responsibility for a project . He had to be a man of great capability , working for a fee plus a percentage of the profits , with penalties for late finishing and inducements to complete the work early . 
 Brassey had considerable skill in choosing good men to work in this way and in delegating the work . Having taken on a contract at an agreed price he would make a suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs . If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money . If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable , Brassey would cover these additional costs . He used hundreds of such agents . At the peak of his career , for well over 20 years , Brassey was employing on average some 80 @,@ 000 people in many countries in four continents . 
 Despite this he had neither an office nor office staff , dealing with all the correspondence himself . Much of the detail of his works were held in his memory . He travelled with a personal valet and later had a cashier . But all his letters were written by him ; it is recorded that on one occasion after the rest of his party had gone to bed , 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight . Although he won a large number of contracts , his bids were not always successful . It has been calculated that for every contract awarded , around six others had been unsuccessful . 
 Brassey was given a number of honours to celebrate his achievements , including the French Légion d 'honneur , the Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and the Austrian Iron Crown ( the first time this had been awarded to a foreigner ) . 
 = = Marriage & progeny = = 
 In 1831 he married Maria Harrison , the second daughter of Joseph Harrison , a forwarding and shipping agent with whom he had come into contact during his early days in Birkenhead . Maria gave Thomas considerable support and encouragement throughout his career . She encouraged him to bid for the contract for Dutton Viaduct and , when that was unsuccessful , to apply for the next available contract . Thomas ' work led to frequent moves of home in their early years ; from Birkenhead to Stafford , Kingston upon Thames , Winchester and then Fareham . On each occasion Maria supervised the packing of their possessions and the removal . The Harrison children had been taught to speak French , while Thomas himself was unable to do so . Therefore , when the opportunity arose to apply for the French contracts , Maria was willing to act as interpreter and encouraged Thomas to bid for them . This resulted in moves to Vernon in Normandy , then to Rouen , on to Paris and back again to Rouen . Thomas refused to learn French and Maria acted as interpreter for all his French undertakings . Maria organised the education of their three sons . In time the family established a more @-@ or @-@ less permanent base in Lowndes Square , Belgravia , London . They had three sons , who all gained distinction in their own right : 
 Thomas Brassey , 1st Earl Brassey ( b . 1836 ) became a Liberal MP , Governor of Victoria and was created Earl Brassey in 1911 . 
 Henry Brassey ( b . 1840 ) was Liberal MP for Hastings . His son was Henry Brassey , 1st Baron Brassey of <unk> , a Conservative politician , who was elevated to the House of Lords in 1938 . 
 Albert Brassey ( b . 1844 ) was Conservative MP for Banbury . 
 a fourth son died in infancy . 
 = = Later years = = 
 In 1870 Brassey was told that he had cancer but he continued to visit his working sites . One of his last visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway , only a few miles from his first railway contract at Penkridge . In the late summer of 1870 he took to his bed at his home in St Leonards @-@ on @-@ Sea . There he was visited by members of his work force , not only his engineers and agents , but also his navvies , many of whom had walked for days to come and pay their respects . 
 When Brassey 's business friend , Edward Betts , became insolvent in 1867 , Brassey bought Betts ' estate at Preston Hall , Aylesford in Kent on behalf of his second son , Henry . 
 In 1870 Brassey purchased Heythrop Park , a baroque house situated in an estate of 450 acres ( 1 @.@ 8 km2 ) 15 miles ( 24 km ) northeast of Oxford as a wedding present for his third son , Albert . 
 On 8 December 1870 Thomas Brassey died from a brain haemorrhage in Victoria Hotel , St Leonards and was buried in the churchyard at <unk> , Sussex where a memorial stone has been erected . His estate was valued at £ 5 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 which consisted of " under £ 3 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 in UK " and " over £ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 " in a trust fund . The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes him as " one of the wealthiest of the self @-@ made Victorians " .

 It is not easy to be objective about the nature of Thomas Brassey 's character because the earliest biography by Helps was commissioned by the Brassey family and the latest , rather short , biography was written by his great @-@ great @-@ grandson , Tom Stacey . There is virtually no remaining material of value to a biographer available today . There is no private correspondence , there are no diaries and none of his personal reminiscences . 
 Judging by his achievements alone , he must have been a remarkable man . He had enormous drive , an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures , and extreme skill in organisation . He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise . He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament . Although he accepted honours from France and Austria , he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife . His great @-@ great @-@ grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them . 
 Walker , in his 1969 biography , tried to make an accurate assessment of Brassey using Helps and other sources . He found it difficult to discover anyone who had a bad word to say about him , either during his life or since . Brassey expected a high standard of work from his employees ; Cooke states that his " standards of quality were fastidious in the extreme " . There can be no doubt about some of his qualities . He was exceptionally hardworking , and had an excellent memory and ability to perform mental arithmetic . He was a good judge of men , which enabled him to select the best people to be his agents . He was scrupulously fair with his subcontractors and kind to his navvies , supporting them financially at their times of need . He would at times undertake contracts of little benefit to himself to provide work for his navvies . The only faults which his eldest son could identify were a tendency to praise traits and actions of other people he would condemn in his own family , and an inability to refuse a request . No criticism of him could be found from the engineers with whom he worked , his business associates , his agents or his navvies . He paid his men fairly and generously . 
 The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states " His greatest achievement was to raise the status of the civil engineering contractor to the eminence already attained in the mid @-@ nineteenth century by the engineer " . Walker regards him as " one of the giants of the nineteenth century " . 
 = = Commemorations = = 
 None of his three sons became involved in their father 's work and the business was wound up by administrators . The sons created a memorial to their parents in St Erasmus ' Chapel in Chester cathedral . This consists of a backcloth to the altar inscribed to their parents ' memory , and a bust of their father to the north of the altar . The memorial is by Sir Arthur Blomfield and the bust by M. <unk> . There is also a bust of Thomas in Chester 's Grosvenor Museum and plaques to his memory in Chester station . Streets named after him in Chester are Brassey Street and Thomas Brassey Close ( which is off Lightfoot Street ) . 
 In November 2005 , Penkridge celebrated the bicentenary of Brassey 's birth and a special commemorative train was run from Chester to Holyhead . In January 2007 , children from <unk> Junior School in Upton , Wirral celebrated the life of Brassey . In April 2007 a plaque was placed on Brassey 's first bridge at Saughall Massie . In the village of Bulkeley , near Malpas , Cheshire , is a tree called the ' Brassey Oak ' on land once owned by the Brassey family . This was planted to celebrate Thomas ' 40th birthday in 1845 . It was surrounded by four inscribed sandstone pillars tied together by iron rails but due to the growth of the tree these burst and the stones fell . They were recovered and in 2007 were replaced in a more accessible place with an information board .

 Hasaan Ibn Ali ( born William Henry Langford , Jr . ; May 6 , 1931 – 1980 ) was an American jazz pianist and composer . 
 Ibn Ali was strongly influenced by Elmo Hope , and his playing was rapid and intense , retaining a sense of rhythm even when his style became increasingly unconventional . Several recordings of his playing may exist , but only one – The Max Roach Trio Featuring the Legendary Hasaan – has been released . Ibn Ali built a reputation in Philadelphia , where he influenced musicians including John Coltrane , but he remained little known elsewhere . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 Hasaan Ibn Ali was born William Henry Langford , Jr. in Philadelphia on May 6 , 1931 . In 1946 ( aged 15 ) he toured with trumpeter Joe Morris 's rhythm and blues band . In 1950 he played locally with Clifford Brown , Miles Davis , J. J. Johnson , Max Roach , and others . Based in Philadelphia , Ibn Ali did freelance work and built a reputation locally as " an original composer and theorist " , in musicologist Lewis Porter 's words . The pianist played with Horace Arnold in New York City in 1959 , and again in 1961 – 62 , this time in a trio with Henry Grimes . According to Roach , on visits to New York , Ibn Ali went from club to club to play , and sometimes went to the drummer 's home in the middle of the night to continue playing , alone , on the piano there . 
 Ibn Ali remained an obscure figure until his only released recording , The Max Roach Trio Featuring the Legendary Hasaan , which was recorded on December 4 and 7 , 1964 , and released six months later . The trio contained Roach and bassist Art Davis , and the album consisted of seven tracks , all written by Ibn Ali . The recording opportunity was initiated by Roach , who used his influence with the owner of Atlantic Records to secure the session for Ibn Ali . Alan <unk> , in his liner notes to the album , wrote " For a while it appeared that it was Hasaan Ibn Ali 's destiny to be known – to those who had heard of him at all – as the extraordinary jazz pianist from Philadelphia who had never made a record . " After the album , Ibn Ali returned to obscurity . 
 According to music journalist Tom Moon , Ibn Ali was " Described by ( usually tolerant ) jazz musicians as eccentric and / or unstable " . Saxophonist <unk> Pope , who was mentored by Ibn Ali , stated that the pianist " was so advanced that musicians shied away from him . [ ... ] He was very dedicated , very sincere , but also very outspoken [ ... ] If he were in a club , and the pianist wasn 't making it , Hasaan would push him right off the bench and start playing himself . " 
 Ibn Ali had further studio sessions , with Pope , Art Davis and drummer Khalil Madi , on August 23 and September 7 , 1965 . However , the master tapes of the unreleased recordings were said to have been destroyed in a fire at the record label 's warehouse in 1976 . The Library of Congress has a 1964 recording of an Ibn Ali solo improvisation , recorded at Roach 's home . John Murph in JazzTimes described it in 2014 as " Thoroughly modern with a whimsical rhythmic undertow and wayward melodic passages , it sounds like a new Jason Moran composition . " 
 " Reckless with his health , Hasaan died young " , commented writer Geoffrey Haydon in 2002 . The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz states that Ibn Ali died in Philadelphia in 1980 ( aged 48 or 49 ) .

 A contemporary reviewer for The Glasgow Herald commented on Ibn Ali 's playing on the Atlantic album with Roach that " One 's first reaction is astonishment at the blazing finger technique , [ ... ] and the complete individuality of his harmonics [ sic ] " . AllMusic reviewer Scott Yanow described Ibn Ali 's playing on the album as " intense , somewhat virtuosic and rhythmic , yet often melodic in a quirky way " . 
 Drummer Sherman Ferguson said of Ibn Ali , " he was a prime example of somebody that was very avant @-@ garde in some ways , but he was always musical . So people of all ages liked his music , even when he played out . [ ... He ] had that thing , where he had a natural feeling . He got to the thing where it swung no matter what he was doing . " Saxophonist Benny Golson commented that Ibn Ali " became very skilled at the modern sounds , and then went right past them into something very esoteric . He went way out there . I guess you could say his brakes didn 't work . " 
 Jazz critic Kenny Mathieson described Ibn Ali as " An Elmo Hope acolyte with a rhythmic quirkiness that had him compared with [ Thelonious ] Monk and [ Herbie ] Nichols " . Ibn Ali himself credited Hope with being his main inspiration : " by meeting Mr Hope it was like talking to and having acquaintance with the mystery of music , who explained not by the ruler or lip but with music . So from him I heard how to learn . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Pope credits Ibn Ali with influencing saxophonist John Coltrane 's sheets of sound approach . Ibn Ali examined the possibilities of playing fourths , and of using " chord progressions that moved by seconds or thirds instead of fifths , in playing a variety of scales and arpeggios against each chord " – features later used extensively in Coltrane 's playing . A home recording of Ibn Ali playing with Coltrane and others in 1952 may exist . 
 Pope also commented that " every important musician who came out of this area [ Philadelphia ] in the fifties and sixties , including McCoy Tyner , learned from him . " 
 = Shifang protest = 
 The Shifang protest was a large @-@ scale environmental protest in the southwestern Chinese city of Shifang , Sichuan province , against a copper plant that residents feared posed environmental and public health risks . The protests spanned 1 – 3 July 2012 , and drew thousands of participants . Police were dispatched to break up the demonstrations , and reportedly shot tear gas and stun grenades into the crowd . Chinese authorities said some protesters has stormed a government building and smashed vehicles . Images and video of the protest circulated on the microblogs and social networking websites throughout China , some showing the protesters — many of them students — badly beaten . The protests ended late on 3 July when the local government announced that it had terminated construction of the metals plant and released all but six protesters who had been taken into custody . 
 The protest was notable for its size and the composition of its participants , as well as for its success in derailing the copper plant project . It was one of a growing number of large @-@ scale environmental protests in China that achieved success . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Shifang city area was among the most severely impacted by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake , suffering heavy loss of life and major damage to infrastructure . The centerpiece of the city 's economic revitalization efforts was to be the Sichuan Hongda Co . ' s copper smelting plant . The plant was to be one of the largest in the world , and its construction was intended to spur economic growth through the creation of thousands of jobs . China 's Ministry of Environmental Protection said the $ 1 @.@ 7 billion plant would refine 40 @,@ 000 tons of molybdenum and 400 @,@ 000 tons of copper annually . 
 Copper smelting and refining processes can produce a variety of toxic byproducts , including mercury , sulphur dioxide , and arsenic . Residents feared these pollutants would seep into the city 's air and water supply . Critics further charged that the government had not been transparent in reviewing or disclosing information on the plant 's potential environmental impact . Ma Jun , director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs , told The Guardian that the government " only released the short version of the plant 's environmental report , which did not have information about the solid waste and waste water . " Ma added : " Heavy metal projects are always highly polluting . Of course the public has concerns about this . " Residents of the city had reportedly filed petitions against the project , but authorities took no action . Reuters reported that although many local residents supported the efforts to create jobs , they were upset by the government 's lack of consultation with the public and failure to adequately address environmental concerns . 
 = = Protests = = 
 Construction on the Sichuan Hongda copper refinery began on 29 June with the company laying the foundation for the plant . Two days later , on 1 July , hundreds of student protesters assembled in front of municipal government buildings to protest the project . Protests grew on 2 and 3 July as thousands more citizens — including students from nearby <unk> city — demonstrated on the streets and in front of government offices demanding the suspension of the project . Protesters carried banners with slogans such as " Unite to protect the environment for the next generation " and " Safeguard our hometown , oppose the chemical factory 's construction . " The South China Morning Post reported that the protest swelled to have tens of thousands of participants . 
 Authorities and state @-@ run media reported that the protests turned violent , with demonstrators overturning police vehicles and throwing bricks at government buildings . Police were dispatched to quell the protests , firing tear gas and stun grenades into the crowd , and detaining 27 protesters . Images and video circulated online showing protesters bloodied and beaten , and police carrying batons and lobbing tear gas into the crowds . Witnesses told the South China Morning Post that about 8 @,@ 000 police were stationed along major roads , and that the security officers had used force to disperse the protests . 
 The local government announced on the morning of 3 July that the copper plant construction would be suspended . Protests continued into the evening , with demonstrators demanding the release of the detained protesters , most of whom were students . Late in the evening of 3 July , authorities released 21 of the 27 detained protesters . Protests subsided , though six remained in custody facing criminal and administrative charges for their role in the demonstrations . 
 Public demonstrations were briefly revived on 9 July amidst unverified rumors that a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl had been beaten to death during the protests . However , authorities consistently refuted reports of casualties or mass bloodshed , saying that only a few residents and police officers were injured . Local authorities also said that police had " exercised great restraint " in their handling of the protest . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Two months after the protests in Shifang , residents told the New York Times that there were no signs that the Sichuan Hongda project was being resuscitated , and that the city had been quiet since the demonstrations concluded . An executive with Sichuan Hongda told <unk> magazine on July 9 that it was unclear whether the construction for copper plant would go forward in the future , and whether it would be located in Sichuan province . 
 After the demonstrations , authorities were left to grapple with providing housing and compensation to approximately 2 @,@ 300 villagers whose land had been requisitioned to make room for the copper plant . Villagers from <unk> and <unk> , Shifang , reportedly received eviction notices in November 2011 and saw their homes demolished the following month . As of July 2012 , they had yet to receive promised compensation from the government . 
 During a Communist Party committee meeting on 25 October 2012 , authorities in Shifang decided to replace the local party secretary , Li <unk> . His position was assumed by former mayor Li Zhuo .

 = = = Role of students = = = 
 The Shifang protests were notable in part due to the composition of the demonstration , which was largely led and organized by young students . Although China experiences tens of thousands of large @-@ scale protests annually , student involvement in anti @-@ government protests has been rare since the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests . Leslie Hook of the Financial Times wrote that the protests " revealed a potentially important shift in the country 's politics : youth were at the forefront of the three @-@ day demonstration , exposing a new vein of activism in a generation seen by many as apathetic . " Environmental causes and land rights issues seemed particularly attractive to the " post 90s " generation , she wrote . Stanley Lubman wrote for the Wall Street Journal that " the protests may augur both a growing public anger over environmental degradation and a rise of political activism among China 's younger generation – trends that could lead in turn to an increase in legal challenges to the arbitrary behavior of local governments . " Chinese blogger Michael Anti explained the shift by saying that the generation born after 1990 is " the generation of social media so they embrace freedom of speech as their birthright . " 
 Alarmed by the participation of students in the demonstration , the state @-@ run Global Times newspaper ran an editorial on 6 July titled " Do not foment youngsters to protest . " The editorial exhorted young people to stay out of mass protests and political conflicts , and chastised adults who encouraged such behavior : " In every normal peaceful country , high school students should focus on school work . It is a revolutionary instinct to urge young students to join a mass protest ... It is immoral for adults to exploit the young for political ends . " The editorial was met with some derision on Chinese social media websites ; one netizen responded by drawing attention to images of young school children being organized to participate in political rallies supporting the ruling Communist Party . 
 = = = Importance of social media = = = 
 As the Shifang protest unfolded , government @-@ run media outlets were largely silent in covering developments in the city . On 3 July , for instance , the official media outlets People 's Daily and Xinhua News Agency carried minimal reports on either the protests or the local government 's promise to halt construction of the copper smelting plant . Social media platforms and text messaging thus became the primary means by which information on the protests were shared . According to the University of Hong Kong 's China Media Project , between 1 and 4 July , " there were around 5 @.@ 25 million posts on Sina Weibo containing ' Shifang ' . Of these about 400 @,@ 000 included images and close to 10 @,@ 000 included video . " 
 The protests gave rise a popular internet meme based on a photograph of a shield and baton @-@ wielding police officer , identified as Liu Bo , chasing a group of young protesters . Liu 's image was photoshopped into other scenes , depicting him chasing after actor Mark Wahlberg and Olympic hurdler Liu Xiang , or appearing in the background of Edvard Munch 's The Scream . The Atlantic 's Jessica Levine wrote that the image was " representative of a growing resentment toward alleged abuses by the People 's Armed Police , " noting that such memes can serve as a barometer of culture in an environment where freedom of speech is limited . " Because of the strictures on speech in China , memes tend to be a really effective way to spread a political message , " said Chinese social media expert and blogger An Xiao Mina . " If you use off @-@ the @-@ cuff , remixed humor , it 's a little easier to talk about such critical topics . " 
 = Gettysburg Address = 
 The Gettysburg Address is a speech by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln , one of the best @-@ known in American history . It was delivered by Lincoln during the American Civil War , on the afternoon of Thursday , November 19 , 1863 , at the dedication of the Soldiers ' National Cemetery in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , four and a half months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg . 
 Abraham Lincoln 's carefully crafted address , secondary to other presentations that day , was one of the greatest and most influential statements of national purpose . In just over two minutes , Lincoln reiterated the principles of human equality espoused by the Declaration of Independence and proclaimed the Civil War as a struggle for the preservation of the Union sundered by the secession crisis , with " a new birth of freedom " that would bring true equality to all of its citizens . Lincoln also redefined the Civil War as a struggle not just for the Union , but also for the principle of human equality . 
 Beginning with the now @-@ iconic phrase " Four score and seven years ago " — referring to the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 — Lincoln examined the founding principles of the United States as stated in the Declaration of Independence . In the context of the Civil War , Lincoln also memorialized the sacrifices of those who gave their lives at Gettysburg and extolled virtues for the listeners ( and the nation ) to ensure the survival of America 's representative democracy : that " government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . " 
 Despite the speech 's prominent place in the history and popular culture of the United States , the exact wording and location of the speech are disputed . The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address in Lincoln 's hand differ in a number of details , and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech . Modern scholarship locates the speakers ' platform 40 yards ( or more ) away from the Traditional Site within Soldiers ' National Cemetery at the Soldiers ' National Monument and entirely within private , adjacent Evergreen Cemetery . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1 – 3 , 1863 , reburial of Union soldiers from the Gettysburg Battlefield graves began on October 17 . David Wills , of the committee for the November 19 Consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg , invited President Lincoln : " It is the desire that , after the Oration , you , as Chief Executive of the nation , formally set apart these grounds to their sacred use by a few appropriate remarks . " Lincoln 's address followed the oration by Edward Everett , who subsequently included a copy of the Gettysburg Address in his 1864 book about the event ( Address of the Hon. Edward Everett At the Consecration of the National Cemetery At Gettysburg , 19th November 1863 , with the <unk> Speech of President Lincoln , and the Other Exercises of the Occasion ; Accompanied by An Account of the Origin of the Undertaking and of the Arrangement of the Cemetery Grounds , and by a Map of the Battle @-@ field and a Plan of the Cemetery ) . 
 During the train trip from Washington , D.C. , to Gettysburg on November 18 , Lincoln remarked to John Hay that he felt weak . On the morning of November 19 , Lincoln mentioned to John Nicolay that he was dizzy . In the railroad car the President rode with his secretary , John G. Nicolay , his assistant secretary , John Hay , the three members of his Cabinet who accompanied him , William Seward , John Usher and Montgomery Blair , several foreign officials and others . Hay noted that during the speech Lincoln 's face had ' a ghastly color ' and that he was ' sad , mournful , almost haggard . ' After the speech , when Lincoln boarded the 6 : 30 pm train for Washington , D.C. , he was feverish and weak , with a severe headache . A protracted illness followed , which included a vesicular rash and was diagnosed as a mild case of smallpox . It thus seems highly likely that Lincoln was in the prodromal period of smallpox when he delivered the Gettysburg address .

 The program organized for that day by Wills and his committee included :

 While it is Lincoln 's short speech that has gone down in history as one of the finest examples of English public oratory , it was Everett 's two @-@ hour oration that was slated to be the " Gettysburg address " that day . His now seldom @-@ read 13 @,@ 607 @-@ word oration began : 
 Standing beneath this serene sky , overlooking these broad fields now reposing from the labors of the waning year , the mighty Alleghenies dimly towering before us , the graves of our brethren beneath our feet , it is with hesitation that I raise my poor voice to break the eloquent silence of God and Nature . But the duty to which you have called me must be performed ; — grant me , I pray you , your indulgence and your sympathy . 
 And ended two hours later with : 
 But they , I am sure , will join us in saying , as we bid farewell to the dust of these martyr @-@ heroes , that wheresoever throughout the civilized world the accounts of this great warfare are read , and down to the latest period of recorded time , in the glorious annals of our common country , there will be no brighter page than that which relates the Battles of Gettysburg . 
 Lengthy dedication addresses like Everett 's were common at cemeteries in this era . The tradition began in 1831 when Justice Joseph Story delivered the dedication address at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge , Massachusetts . Those addresses often linked cemeteries to the mission of Union . 
 = = Text of Gettysburg Address = = 
 Shortly after Everett 's well @-@ received remarks , Lincoln spoke for only a few minutes . With a " few appropriate remarks " , he was able to summarize his view of the war in just ten sentences . 
 Despite the historical significance of Lincoln 's speech , modern scholars disagree as to its exact wording , and contemporary transcriptions published in newspaper accounts of the event and even handwritten copies by Lincoln himself differ in their wording , punctuation , and structure . Of these versions , the Bliss version , written well after the speech as a favor for a friend , is viewed by many as the standard text . Its text differs , however , from the written versions prepared by Lincoln before and after his speech . It is the only version to which Lincoln affixed his signature , and the last he is known to have written . 
 Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal . 
 Now we are engaged in a great civil war , testing whether that nation , or any nation so conceived and so dedicated , can long endure . We are met on a great battlefield of that war . We have come to dedicate a portion of that field , as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live . It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this . 
 But , in a larger sense , we can not dedicate , we can not consecrate , we can not hallow this ground . The brave men , living and dead , who struggled here , have consecrated it , far above our poor power to add or detract . The world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , but it can never forget what they did here . It is for us the living , rather , to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced . It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation , under God , shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . 
 = = Lincoln 's sources = = 
 In Lincoln at Gettysburg , Garry Wills notes the parallels between Lincoln 's speech and Pericles 's Funeral Oration during the Peloponnesian War as described by Thucydides . ( James McPherson notes this connection in his review of Wills 's book . Gore Vidal also draws attention to this link in a BBC documentary about oration . ) Pericles ' speech , like Lincoln 's , begins with an acknowledgment of revered predecessors : " I shall begin with our ancestors : it is both just and proper that they should have the honor of the first mention on an occasion like the present " ; then praises the uniqueness of the State 's commitment to democracy : " If we look to the laws , they afford equal justice to all in their private differences " ; honors the sacrifice of the slain , " Thus choosing to die resisting , rather than to live submitting , they fled only from dishonor , but met danger face to face " ; and exhorts the living to continue the struggle : " You , their survivors , must determine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field , though you may pray that it may have a happier issue . " In contrast , writer Adam Gopnik , in The New Yorker , notes that while Everett 's Oration was explicitly neoclassical , referring directly to Marathon and Pericles , " Lincoln 's rhetoric is , instead , deliberately Biblical . ( It is difficult to find a single obviously classical reference in any of his speeches . ) Lincoln had mastered the sound of the King James Bible so completely that he could recast abstract issues of constitutional law in Biblical terms , making the proposition that Texas and New Hampshire should be forever bound by a single post office sound like something right out of Genesis . " 
 Several theories have been advanced by Lincoln scholars to explain the provenance of Lincoln 's famous phrase " government of the people , by the people , for the people " . The Prologue to John Wycliffe 's first English translation of the Bible , which first appeared in 1384 , includes the phrase : 
 This Bible is for the government of the people , for the people and by the people . 
 In a discussion " A more probable origin of a famous Lincoln phrase " , in The American Monthly Review of Reviews , Albert Shaw credits a correspondent with pointing out the writings of William Herndon , Lincoln 's law partner , who wrote in the 1888 work Abraham Lincoln : The True Story of A Great Life that he had brought to Lincoln some of the sermons of abolitionist minister Theodore Parker , of Massachusetts , and that Lincoln was moved by Parker 's use of this idea : 
 I brought with me additional sermons and lectures of Theodore Parker , who was warm in his commendation of Lincoln . One of these was a lecture on ' The Effect of Slavery on the American People ' ... which I gave to Lincoln , who read and returned it . He liked especially the following expression , which he marked with a pencil , and which he in substance afterwards used in his Gettysburg Address : ' Democracy is direct self @-@ government , over all the people , for all the people , by all the <unk> 
 Craig R. Smith , in " Criticism of Political Rhetoric and Disciplinary Integrity " , suggested Lincoln 's view of the government as expressed in the Gettysburg Address was influenced by the noted speech of Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster , the " Second Reply to Hayne " , in which Webster famously thundered " Liberty and Union , now and forever , one and inseparable ! " Specifically , in this speech on January 26 , 1830 , before the United States Senate , Webster described the federal government as : " made for the people , made by the people , and answerable to the people " , foreshadowing Lincoln 's " government of the people , by the people , for the people " . Webster also noted , " This government , Sir , is the independent offspring of the popular will . It is not the creature of State legislatures ; nay , more , if the whole truth must be told , the people brought it into existence , established it , and have hitherto supported it , for the very purpose , amongst others , of imposing certain salutary restraints on State sovereignties . " 
 A source predating these others with which Lincoln was certainly familiar was Chief Justice John Marshall 's opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) , a case asserting federal authority to create a national bank and to be free from the State 's powers to tax . In asserting the superiority of federal power over the states , Chief Justice Marshall stated : " The government of the Union , then ( whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case ) , is , emphatically and truly , a government of the people . In form , and in substance , it emanates from them . Its powers are granted by them , and are to be exercised directly on them , and for their benefit . " Lincoln , a lawyer and President engaged in the greatest struggle of federalism , was ( more eloquently ) echoing the preeminent case that had solidified federal power over the States . 
 Wills observed Lincoln 's usage of the imagery of birth , life , and death in reference to a nation " brought forth " , " conceived " , and that shall not " perish " . Others , including Allen C. Guelzo , the director of Civil War Era studies at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania , suggested that Lincoln 's formulation " four score and seven " was an allusion to the King James Version of the Bible 's Psalms 90 : 10 , in which man 's lifespan is given as " <unk> years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be <unk> years " . 
 = = Five manuscripts = = 
 Each of the five known manuscript copies of the Gettysburg Address is named for the person who received it from Lincoln . Lincoln gave copies to his private secretaries , John Nicolay and John Hay . Both of these drafts were written around the time of his November 19 address , while the other three copies of the address , the Everett , Bancroft , and Bliss copies , were written by Lincoln for charitable purposes well after November 19 . In part because Lincoln provided a title and signed and dated the Bliss copy , it has become the standard text of Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address . 
 Nicolay and Hay were appointed custodians of Lincoln 's papers by Lincoln 's son Robert Todd Lincoln in 1874 . After appearing in facsimile in an article written by John Nicolay in 1894 , the Nicolay copy was presumably among the papers passed to Hay by Nicolay 's daughter Helen upon Nicolay 's death in 1901 . Robert Lincoln began a search for the original copy in 1908 , which resulted in the discovery of a handwritten copy of the Gettysburg Address among the bound papers of John Hay — a copy now known as the " Hay copy " or " Hay draft " . 
 The Hay draft differed from the version of the Gettysburg Address published by John Nicolay in 1894 in a number of significant ways : it was written on a different type of paper , had a different number of words per line and number of lines , and contained editorial revisions in Lincoln 's hand . 
 Both the Hay and Nicolay copies of the Address are within the Library of Congress , encased in specially designed , temperature @-@ controlled , sealed containers with argon gas in order to protect the documents from oxidation and continued deterioration . 
 = = = Nicolay copy = = = 
 The Nicolay copy is often called the " first draft " because it is believed to be the earliest copy that exists . Scholars disagree over whether the Nicolay copy was actually the reading copy Lincoln held at Gettysburg on November 19 . In an 1894 article that included a facsimile of this copy , Nicolay , who had become the custodian of Lincoln 's papers , wrote that Lincoln had brought to Gettysburg the first part of the speech written in ink on Executive Mansion stationery , and that he had written the second page in pencil on lined paper before the dedication on November 19 . Matching folds are still evident on the two pages , suggesting it could be the copy that eyewitnesses say Lincoln took from his coat pocket and read at the ceremony . Others believe that the delivery text has been lost , because some of the words and phrases of the Nicolay copy do not match contemporary transcriptions of Lincoln 's original speech . The words " under God " , for example , are missing in this copy from the phrase " that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom ... " In order for the Nicolay draft to have been the reading copy , either the contemporary transcriptions were inaccurate , or Lincoln would have had to depart from his written text in several instances . This copy of the Gettysburg Address apparently remained in John Nicolay 's possession until his death in 1901 , when it passed to his friend and colleague John Hay . It used to be on display as part of the American Treasures exhibition of the Library of Congress in Washington , D.C. 
 = = = Hay copy = = = 
 The existence of the Hay copy was first announced to the public in 1906 , after the search for the " original manuscript " of the Address among the papers of John Hay brought it to light . Significantly , it differs somewhat from the manuscript of the Address described by John Nicolay in his article , and contains numerous omissions and inserts in Lincoln 's own hand , including omissions critical to the basic meaning of the sentence , not simply words that would be added by Lincoln to strengthen or clarify their meaning . In this copy , as in the Nicolay copy , the words " under God " are not present . 
 This version has been described as " the most inexplicable " of the drafts and is sometimes referred to as the " second draft " . The " Hay copy " was made either on the morning of the delivery of the Address , or shortly after Lincoln 's return to Washington . Those who believe that it was completed on the morning of his address point to the fact that it contains certain phrases that are not in the first draft but are in the reports of the address as delivered and in subsequent copies made by Lincoln . It is probable , they conclude , that , as stated in the explanatory note accompanying the original copies of the first and second drafts in the Library of Congress , Lincoln held this second draft when he delivered the address . Lincoln eventually gave this copy to his other personal secretary , John Hay , whose descendants donated both it and the Nicolay copy to the Library of Congress in 1916 .

 The Everett copy , also known as the " Everett @-@ Keyes copy " , was sent by President Lincoln to Edward Everett in early 1864 , at Everett 's request . Everett was collecting the speeches at the Gettysburg dedication into one bound volume to sell for the benefit of stricken soldiers at New York 's Sanitary Commission Fair . The draft Lincoln sent became the third autograph copy , and is now in the possession of the Illinois State Historical Library in Springfield , Illinois , where it is currently on display in the Treasures Gallery of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum .

 The Bancroft copy of the Gettysburg Address was written out by President Lincoln in February 1864 at the request of George Bancroft , the famed historian and former Secretary of the Navy , whose comprehensive ten @-@ volume History of the United States later led him to be known as the " father of American History " . Bancroft planned to include this copy in Autograph Leaves of Our Country 's Authors , which he planned to sell at a Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Sanitary Fair in Baltimore . As this fourth copy was written on both sides of the paper , it proved unusable for this purpose , and Bancroft was allowed to keep it . This manuscript is the only one accompanied both by a letter from Lincoln transmitting the manuscript and by the original envelope addressed and franked by Lincoln . This copy remained in the Bancroft family for many years , was sold to various dealers and purchased by Nicholas and Marguerite Lilly Noyes , who donated the manuscript to Cornell in 1949 . It is now held by the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections in the Carl A. <unk> Library at Cornell University . It is the only one of the five copies to be privately owned . 
 = = = Bliss copy = = = 
 Discovering that his fourth written copy could not be used , Lincoln then wrote a fifth draft , which was accepted for the purpose requested . The Bliss copy , named for Colonel Alexander Bliss , Bancroft 's stepson and publisher of Autograph Leaves , is the only draft to which Lincoln affixed his signature . Lincoln is not known to have made any further copies of the Gettysburg Address . Because of the apparent care in its preparation , and in part because Lincoln provided a title and signed and dated this copy , it has become the standard version of the address and the source for most facsimile reproductions of Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address . It is the version that is inscribed on the South wall of the Lincoln Memorial . 
 This draft is now displayed in the Lincoln Room of the White House , a gift of Oscar B. Cintas , former Cuban Ambassador to the United States . Cintas , a wealthy collector of art and manuscripts , purchased the Bliss copy at a public auction in 1949 for $ 54 @,@ 000 ( $ 537 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) , at that time the highest price ever paid for a document at public auction . Cintas ' properties were claimed by the Castro government after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 , but Cintas , who died in 1957 , willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people , provided it would be kept at the White House , where it was transferred in 1959 . 
 Garry Wills concluded the Bliss copy " is stylistically preferable to others in one significant way : Lincoln removed ' here ' from ' that cause for which they ( here ) gave ... ' The seventh ' here ' is in all other versions of the speech . " Wills noted the fact that Lincoln " was still making such improvements " , suggesting Lincoln was more concerned with a perfected text than with an ' original ' one . 
 From November 21 , 2008 , to January 1 , 2009 , the Albert H. Small Documents Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History hosted a limited public viewing of the Bliss copy , with the support of then @-@ First Lady Laura Bush . The Museum also launched an online exhibition and interactive gallery to enable visitors to look more closely at the document .

 Another contemporary source of the text is the Associated Press dispatch , transcribed from the shorthand notes taken by reporter Joseph L. Gilbert . It also differs from the drafted text in a number of minor ways .

 Eyewitness reports vary as to their view of Lincoln 's performance . In 1931 , the printed recollections of 87 @-@ year @-@ old Mrs. Sarah A. Cooke Myers , who was 19 when she attended the ceremony , suggest a dignified silence followed Lincoln 's speech : " I was close to the President and heard all of the Address , but it seemed short . Then there was an impressive silence like our <unk> Friends Meeting . There was no applause when he stopped speaking . " According to historian Shelby Foote , after Lincoln 's presentation , the applause was delayed , scattered , and " barely polite " . In contrast , Pennsylvania Governor Curtin maintained , " He pronounced that speech in a voice that all the multitude heard . The crowd was hushed into silence because the President stood before them ... It was so Impressive ! It was the common remark of everybody . Such a speech , as they said it was ! " <unk> of soldiers ' remains from field graves into the cemetery , which had begun within months of the battle , was less than half complete on the day of the ceremony . 
 In an oft @-@ repeated legend , Lincoln is said to have turned to his bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon and remarked that his speech , like a bad plow , " won 't scour " . According to Garry Wills , this statement has no basis in fact and largely originates from the unreliable recollections of Lamon . In Garry Wills 's view , " [ Lincoln ] had done what he wanted to do [ at Gettysburg ] " . 
 In a letter to Lincoln written the following day , Everett praised the President for his eloquent and concise speech , saying , " I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion , in two hours , as you did in two minutes . " Lincoln replied that he was glad to know the speech was not a " total failure " . 
 Other public reaction to the speech was divided along partisan lines . The Democratic @-@ leaning Chicago Times observed , " The cheek of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly , flat and <unk> utterances of the man who has to be pointed out to intelligent foreigners as the President of the United States . " In contrast , the Republican @-@ leaning New York Times was complimentary and printed the speech . In Massachusetts , the Springfield Republican also printed the entire speech , calling it " a perfect gem " that was " deep in feeling , compact in thought and expression , and tasteful and elegant in every word and comma " . The Republican predicted that Lincoln 's brief remarks would " repay further study as the model speech " . On the sesquicentennial of the address , The Patriot @-@ News of Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , formerly the Patriot & Union , retracted its original reaction ( " silly remarks " deserving " the veil of oblivion " ) stating : " Seven score and ten years ago , the forefathers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed , so tainted by hubris , so lacking in the perspective history would bring , that it cannot remain unaddressed in our archives . ... the Patriot & Union failed to recognize [ the speech 's ] momentous importance , timeless eloquence , and lasting significance . The Patriot @-@ News regrets the error . " 
 Foreign newspapers also criticized Lincoln 's remarks . The Times of London commented : " The ceremony [ at Gettysburg ] was rendered ludicrous by some of the luckless sallies of that poor President Lincoln . " 
 Congressman Joseph A. Goulden , then an eighteen @-@ year @-@ old school teacher , was present and heard the speech . He served in the United States Marine Corps during the war , and later had a successful career in insurance in Pennsylvania and New York City before entering Congress as a Democrat . In his later life , Goulden was often asked about the speech , since the passage of time made him one of a dwindling number of individuals who had been present for it . He commented on the event and Lincoln 's speech in favorable terms , naming Lincoln 's address as one of the inspirations for him to enter military service . Goulden 's recollections included remarks to the House of Representatives in 1914 . 
 = = = Audio recollections = = = 
 William R. Rathvon is the only known eyewitness of both Lincoln 's arrival at Gettysburg and the address itself to have left an audio recording of his recollections . One year before his death in 1939 , Rathvon 's reminiscences were recorded on February 12 , 1938 , at the Boston studios of radio station <unk> , including his reading the address , itself , and a 78 rpm record was pressed . The title of the 78 record was " I Heard Lincoln That Day – William R. Rathvon , TR Productions " . A copy wound up at National Public Radio ( NPR ) during a " Quest for Sound " project in 1999 . NPR continues to air it around Lincoln 's birthday . 
 Like most people who came to Gettysburg , the Rathvon family was aware that Lincoln was going to make some remarks . The family went to the town square where the procession was to form to go out to the cemetery that had not been completed yet . At the head of the procession rode Lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen . Rathvon describes Lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground ; he also mentions the long eloquent speech given by Edward Everett of Massachusetts whom Rathvon accurately described as the " most finished orator of the day " . Rathvon then goes on to describe how Lincoln stepped forward and " with a manner serious almost to sadness , gave his brief address " . During the delivery , along with some other boys , young Rathvon wiggled his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of Mr. Lincoln and looked up into what he described as Lincoln 's " serious face " . Rathvon recalls candidly that , although he listened " intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly " , he explains , " <unk> , I could not recall any of it afterwards " . But he explains that if anyone said anything disparaging about " honest Abe " , there would have been a " junior battle of Gettysburg " . In the recording Rathvon speaks of Lincoln 's speech allegorically " echoing through the hills " . 
 = = = Photographs = = = 
 The only known and confirmed photograph of Lincoln at Gettysburg , taken by photographer David Bachrach was identified in the Mathew Brady collection of photographic plates in the National Archives and Records Administration in 1952 . While Lincoln 's speech was short and may have precluded multiple pictures of him while speaking , he and the other dignitaries sat for hours during the rest of the program . Given the length of Everett 's speech and the length of time it took for 19th @-@ century photographers to get " set up " before taking a picture , it is quite plausible that the photographers were ill @-@ prepared for the brevity of Lincoln 's remarks . 
 = = = Usage of " under God " = = = 
 The words " under God " do not appear in the Nicolay and Hay drafts but are included in the three later copies ( Everett , Bancroft , and Bliss ) . Accordingly , some skeptics maintain that Lincoln did not utter the words " under God " at Gettysburg . However , at least three reporters telegraphed the text of Lincoln 's speech on the day the Address was given with the words " under God " included . Historian William E. Barton argues that : 
 Every stenographic report , good , bad and indifferent , says ' that the nation shall , under God , have a new birth of freedom . ' There was no common source from which all the reporters could have obtained those words but from Lincoln 's own lips at the time of delivery . It will not do to say that [ Secretary of War ] Stanton suggested those words after Lincoln 's return to Washington , for the words were telegraphed by at least three reporters on the afternoon of the delivery . 
 The reporters present included Joseph Gilbert , from the Associated Press ; Charles Hale , from the Boston Advertiser ; John R. Young ( who later became the Librarian of Congress ) , from the Philadelphia Press ; and reporters from the Cincinnati Commercial , New York Tribune , and The New York Times . Charles Hale " had notebook and pencil in hand , [ and ] took down the slow @-@ spoken words of the President " . " He took down what he declared was the exact language of Lincoln 's address , and his declaration was as good as the oath of a court stenographer . His associates confirmed his testimony , which was received , as it deserved to be , at its face value . " One explanation is that Lincoln deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he spoke . Ronald C. White , visiting professor of history at the University of California – Los Angeles and professor of American religious history emeritus at the San Francisco Theological Seminary , wrote in this context of Lincoln 's insertion and usage of " under God " : 
 It was an uncharacteristically spontaneous revision for a speaker who did not trust extemporaneous speech . Lincoln had added impromptu words in several earlier speeches , but always offered a subsequent apology for the change . In this instance , he did not . And Lincoln included " under God " in all three copies of the address he prepared at later dates . " Under God " pointed backward and forward : back to " this nation " , which drew its breath from both political and religious sources , but also forward to a " new birth " . Lincoln had come to see the Civil War as a ritual of purification . The old Union had to die . The old man had to die . Death became a transition to a new Union and a new humanity . 
 The phrase " under God " was used frequently in works published before 1860 , usually with the meaning " with God 's help " .

 Outside the Cemetery and within sight of the cross @-@ walk , a historical marker proclaims : 
 Nearby , Nov. 19 , 1863 , in dedicating the National Cemetery , Abraham Lincoln gave the address which he had written in Washington and revised after his arrival at Gettysburg the evening of November 18 . 
 Directly inside the Taneytown Road entrance are located the Rostrum and the Lincoln Address Memorial . Neither of these is located within 300 yards of any of the five ( or more ) claimed locations for the dedicatory platform .

 Colonel W. Yates Selleck was a marshal in the parade on Consecration Day and was seated on the platform when Lincoln made the address . Selleck marked a map with the position of the platform and described it as " 350 feet almost due north of Soldiers ' National Monument , 40 feet from a point in the outer circle of lots where [ the ] Michigan and New York [ burial sections ] are separated by a path " . A location which approximates this description is 39 ° 49 @.@ 243 ′ N , 77 ° 13 @.@ 869 ′ W. 
 As pointed out in 1973 by retired park historian Frederick <unk> , the Selleck Site is 25 feet lower than the crest of Cemetery Hill , and only the crest presents a panoramic view of the battlefield . A spectacular view from the location of the speech was noted by many eyewitnesses , is consistent with the Traditional Site at the Soldiers ' National Monument ( and other sites on the crest ) but is inconsistent with the Selleck Site . 
 The Kentucky Memorial was erected in 1975 , is located directly adjacent to the Soldiers ' National Monument , and states , " Kentucky honors her son , Abraham Lincoln , who delivered his immortal address at the site now marked by the soldiers ' monument . " With its position at the center of the concentric rings of soldiers ' graves and the continuing endorsement of Lincoln 's native state the Soldiers ' National Monument persists as a credible location for the speech . 
 Writing a physical description of the layout for the Gettysburg National Cemetery under construction in November 1863 , the correspondent from the Cincinnati Daily Commercial described the dividing lines between the state grave plots as " the radii of a common center , where a flag pole is now raised , but where it is proposed to erect a national monument " . With the inclusion of this quotation <unk> inadvertently verifies a central principle of future photographic analyses — a flagpole , rather than the speakers ' platform , occupied the central point of the soldiers ' graves . In fact , the precision of the photo @-@ analyses relies upon the coincidence of position between this temporary flag pole and the future monument . 
 Confusing to today 's tourist , the Kentucky Memorial is contradicted by a newer marker which was erected nearby by the Gettysburg National Military Park and locates the speakers ' platform inside Evergreen Cemetery . Similarly , outdated National Park Service documents which pinpoint the location at the Soldiers ' National Monument have not been systematically revised since the placement of the newer marker . Miscellaneous web pages perpetuate the Traditional Site .

 Based upon photographic analysis , the Gettysburg National Military Park ( <unk> ) placed a marker ( near 39 ° 49 @.@ 199 ′ N 77 ° 13 @.@ 840 ′ W ) which states , " The speakers ' platform was located in Evergreen Cemetery to your left . " The observer of this marker stands facing the fence which separates the two cemeteries ( one public and one private ) . 
 In 1982 , Senior Park Historian Kathleen Georg Harrison first analyzed photographs and proposed a location in Evergreen Cemetery but has not published her analysis . Speaking for Harrison without revealing details , two sources characterize her proposed location as " on or near [ the ] Brown family vault " in Evergreen Cemetery . 
 William A. Frassanito , a former military intelligence analyst , documented a comprehensive photographic analysis in 1995 , and it associates the location of the platform with the position of specific modern headstones in Evergreen Cemetery . According to Frassanito , the extant graves of Israel Yount ( died 1892 ) ( 39 ° 49 @.@ 180 ′ N 77 ° 13 @.@ 845 ′ W ) , John Koch ( died 1913 ) ( 39 ° 49 @.@ 184 ′ N 77 ° 13 @.@ 847 ′ W ) , and George E.

 The GNMP marker , Wills ' interpretation of Harrison 's analysis , and the Frassanito analysis concur that the platform was located in private Evergreen Cemetery , rather than public Soldiers ' National Cemetery . The National Park Service 's National Cemetery Walking Tour brochure is one NPS document which agrees : 
 The Soldiers ' National Monument , long misidentified as the spot from which Lincoln spoke , honors the fallen soldiers . [ The location of the speech ] was actually on the crown of this hill , a short distance on the other side of the iron fence and inside the Evergreen Cemetery , where President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address to a crowd of some 15 @,@ 000 people . 
 While the GNMP marker is unspecific , providing only " to your left " , the locations determined by the Harrison / Wills analysis and the Frassanito analysis differ by 40 yards . Frassanito has documented 1 ) his own conclusion , 2 ) his own methods and 3 ) a refutation of the Harrison site , but neither the GNMP nor Harrison has provided any documentation . Each of the three points to a location in Evergreen Cemetery , as do modern NPS publications . 
 Although Lincoln dedicated the Gettysburg National Cemetery , the monument at the Cemetery 's center actually has nothing to do with Lincoln or his famous speech . Intended to symbolize Columbia paying tribute to her fallen sons , its appreciation has been commandeered by the thirst for a tidy home for the speech . Freeing the Cemetery and Monument to serve their original purpose , honoring of Union departed , is as unlikely as a resolution to the location controversy and the erection of a public monument to the speech in the exclusively private Evergreen Cemetery . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The importance of the Gettysburg Address in the history of the United States is underscored by its enduring presence in American culture . In addition to its prominent place carved into a stone cella on the south wall of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D.C. , the Gettysburg Address is frequently referred to in works of popular culture , with the implicit expectation that contemporary audiences will be familiar with Lincoln 's words . 
 In the many generations that have passed since the Address , it has remained among the most famous speeches in American history , and is often taught in classes about history or civics . Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address is itself referenced in another of those famed orations , Martin Luther King , Jr . ' s " I Have a Dream " speech . Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963 , King began with a reference , by the style of his opening phrase , to President Lincoln and his enduring words : " Five score years ago , a great American , in whose symbolic shadow we stand today , signed the Emancipation Proclamation . This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice . " 
 Phrases from the Address are often used or referenced in other works . The current Constitution of France states that the principle of the Republic of France is " gouvernement du peuple , par le peuple et pour le peuple " ( " government of the people , by the people , and for the people " ) , a literal translation of Lincoln 's words . Sun Yat @-@ Sen 's " Three Principles of the People " were inspired from that phrase as well . The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln has as its ship 's motto the phrase " shall not perish " . 
 U.S. Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts wrote of the address and its enduring presence in American culture after Lincoln 's assassination in April 1865 : " That speech , uttered at the field of Gettysburg ... and now sanctified by the martyrdom of its author , is a monumental act . In the modesty of his nature he said ' the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here ; but it can never forget what they did here . ' He was mistaken . The world at once noted what he said , and will never cease to remember it . " 
 U.S. President John F. Kennedy stated in July 1963 about the battle and Lincoln 's speech : " Five score years ago the ground on which we here stand shuddered under the clash of arms and was consecrated for all time by the blood of American manhood . Abraham Lincoln , in dedicating this great battlefield , has expressed , in words too eloquent for paraphrase or summary , why this sacrifice was necessary . " Sadly , Kennedy would meet the same fate as Abraham Lincoln only three days after the Gettysburg Address centennial . 
 In 2015 , the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation compiled Gettysburg Replies : The World Responds to Abraham Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address . The work challenges leaders to craft 272 word responses to celebrate Abraham Lincoln , the Gettysburg Address , or a related topic . One of the replies was by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson in which he made the point that one of Lincoln 's greatest legacies was establishing , in the same year of the Gettysburg Address , the National Academy of Sciences , which had the longterm effect of " setting our Nation on a course of scientifically enlightened governance , without which we all may perish from this Earth " . 
 = Hurricane Ileana ( 2006 ) = 
 Hurricane Ileana was the fourth of six major hurricanes in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season . Forming from a tropical wave on August 21 , Ileana tracked northwestward off the coast of Mexico throughout its duration . With favorable conditions for intensification , Ileana reached peak winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) within 48 hours of forming . Near peak intensity it passed near Socorro Island , and subsequently began to weaken due to cooler waters . On August 27 Ileana weakened to a remnant low , which dissipated two days later . The hurricane produced heavy rainfall along the Mexican coastline , causing flooding , and one person was killed due to strong waves . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 8 , which subsequently tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection . The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 16 , at which time convection increased along the wave axis . Three days later , a weak low pressure area formed along the wave , and early on August 20 some broad cyclonic turning was evident within the cloud pattern . Gradually , banding features developed around the area of deep convection , and the system was expect to develop further as it moved into an increasingly favorable environment . Convection increased late on August 20 , although it initially remained disorganized ; however , the thunderstorms consolidated near the low , and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression by 1200 UTC on August 21 , about 350 mi ( 560 km ) south @-@ southwest of Acapulco , Mexico . 
 A mid @-@ level ridge over Mexico caused the cyclone to track steadily northwestward . With warm water temperatures and low vertical wind shear , the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Ileana . Convection developed and organized into a central dense overcast , and with abundant low @-@ level moisture , rapid deepening was expected . An eye formed in the center of the convection , and Ileana attained hurricane status late on August 22 . On August 23 , about 48 hours after forming , Ileana reached major hurricane status and a peak intensity of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) about 60 mi ( 100 km ) southeast of Socorro Island . It also attained an atmospheric pressure of 955 mbar , as well as an eye diameter of 23 mi ( 37 km ) . 
 Initially , Ileana was forecast to intensify further to reach Category 4 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . After passing south of Socorro Island , the hurricane began a slow weakening trend due to cooler waters ; as the winds decreased , the eye expanded and the thunderstorms waned . The ridge to its north weakened , causing the storm to slow and turn more to the west @-@ northwest . Early on August 26 , Ileana weakened to tropical storm status . Later that day , convection decreased markedly , and early on August 27 it deteriorated to tropical depression status . By late on August 27 , Ileana had been without deep convection for about 18 hours , and so degenerated into a broad remnant low . It continued slowly westward , dissipating on August 29 about 830 mi ( 1340 km ) west @-@ northwest of Cabo San Lucas . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Hurricane Ileana never significantly impacted land , and no tropical cyclone warnings or watches for the storm . While near peak intensity , it passed 60 mi ( 100 km ) south of the unpopulated Socorro Island ; a station on the island recorded sustained winds of 59 mph ( 95 km / h ) , with gusts to 77 mph ( 125 km / h ) . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along the Mexican coastline , causing flooding in Nayarit , Jalisco , Colima , Michoacán , and Baja California Sur . High surf from Ileana reached the coast , killing one man near Cabo San Lucas despite warnings not to swim in the ocean . 
 = Pink Floyd : Live at Pompeii = 
 Pink Floyd : Live at Pompeii is a 1972 concert documentary film featuring the English psychedelic rock group Pink Floyd performing at the ancient Roman amphitheatre in Pompeii , Italy , directed by Adrian Maben . Although the band perform a typical live set from the era , the film is notable for having no audience . 
 The main footage in and around the amphitheatre was filmed over four days in October 1971 , using the band 's regular touring equipment , including studio @-@ quality 24 @-@ track tape recorders . Additional footage filmed in a Paris television studio the following December was added for the original 1972 release . The film was then re @-@ released in 1974 with additional studio material of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon , and interviews at Abbey Road Studios . 
 The film has subsequently been released on video numerous times , and in 2003 a " Director 's Cut " DVD appeared which combines the original footage from 1971 with more contemporary shots of space and the area around Pompeii , assembled by Maben . A number of notable bands have taken inspiration from the film in creating their own videos , or filming concerts without an audience . 
 = = Background = = 
 Pink Floyd had already experimented with filming outside the context of a standard rock concert , most notably an hour @-@ long performance in KQED TV studios in April 1970 . Adrian Maben had become interested in combining art with Pink Floyd 's music , and during 1971 , he attempted to contact the band 's manager , Steve O 'Rourke , to discuss the possibilities of making a film to achieve this aim . After his original plan of mixing the band with assorted paintings had been rejected , Maben went on holiday to Naples in the early summer . 
 During a visit to Pompeii , he lost his passport , and went back to the amphitheatre he had visited earlier in the day in order to find it . Walking around the deserted ruins , he thought the silence and natural ambient sounds present would make a good backdrop for the music . He also felt that filming the band without an audience would be a good reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter , where the films paid equal attention to performers and audiences . Through his contacts at the University of Naples , Maben managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming . 
 = = Filming = = 
 = = = Pompeii = = = 
 The performances of " Echoes " , " A Saucerful of Secrets " , and " One of These Days " were filmed from 4 to 7 October 1971 . O 'Rourke delivered a demo to Maben in order for him to prepare for the various shots required , which he finally managed to do the night before filming started . The choice of material was primarily the band 's , but while Maben realised it was important to include material from the band 's new album Meddle , he was also keen to include " Careful with That Axe , Eugene " and " A Saucerful of Secrets " , as he felt they would be good numbers to film . " Intro Song " was an early version of " Speak to Me " , which later appeared on The Dark Side of the Moon . 
 The band insisted on playing live , and brought their regular touring gear with them . Their roadie , Peter Watts , suggested that their 24 @-@ track recorder would produce a sound tantamount to that of a studio recording . In addition , it transpired that the natural echo of the amphitheatre provided good acoustics for the recording . The equipment was carried by truck from London , and took three days to reach Pompeii . When it arrived , it was discovered there was insufficient power to drive the equipment correctly , which blew every time it was plugged in . This issue plagued filming for several days , and was finally resolved by running a lengthy cable from the local town hall . 
 The first section of footage to be filmed were montage shots of the band walking around <unk> , mixed with shots of mud , which can be seen at various points in " Echoes " and " Careful with That Axe , Eugene " . For the live performances , the band recorded portions of the songs in sections , which were later spliced together . After each take , they listened to the playback on headphones . Maben closed all the entrances to the amphitheatre , but a few children managed to sneak in , and were allowed to watch the filming quietly from a distance . 
 = = = Paris = = = 
 The remaining songs were filmed in Studio <unk> , Paris , from 13 – 20 December and can be distinguished by the absence of Richard Wright 's beard . To fit in with the theme of the earlier work in Pompeii , the filming around <unk> , along with stock footage of waterfalls and lava and various shots of Roman mosaics and drawings from the Naples National Archaeological Museum were added into the Paris footage . Maben also filmed additional front projection footage for insertion into the Pompeii performances . While both the director and the band were disappointed with this footage , due to a lack of time and money , there was no alternative left but to use it . 
 During the filming in Paris , the band spontaneously suggested they would like to film a short blues with a howling dog , in the style of " Seamus " from Meddle . Maben knew Madonna <unk> , daughter of circus director Joseph <unk> , who was known to walk about Paris with a dog called Nobs . Accordingly , Nobs was invited into the studio , where the footage was filmed . 
 Maben subsequently did some of the editing of the final cut at home , due to financial constraints . He regretted doing this , as he felt it was important to separate his work and home life , but , at the time , he had no choice .
