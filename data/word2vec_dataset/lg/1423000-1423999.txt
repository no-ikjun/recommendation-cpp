 The song 's musical key is A ♭ . Its structure comprises two verses , a middle eight ( or bridge ) section , an instrumental passage ( over the verse melody ) , followed by a final verse that leads into a coda ( or outro ) and a formal ending . In his commentary on " Piggies " , musicologist Alan Pollack remarks on its abundance of classical music traits . These include the use of " arpeggio fragments " in Harrison 's opening guitar motif and the repetition of this four @-@ bar passage before each verse and the bridge – a device typical of Schubert 's various lieder and the works of other nineteenth @-@ century composers . During the song , the expected cycle of fifth notes in the major scale is interrupted through the inclusion of a <unk> ( C7 ) chord , which first appears at the end of the passage leading into the middle eight , before the melody drops down a tone to the minor ii ( B ♭ m ) chord . The same section 's first line ends with the surprise inclusion of a blues @-@ based riff , soon after which the C7 chord is used again in the ascent to the IV ( subdominant ) chord , helping to accentuate the phrase " damn good whacking " . 
 As a further example of the melody 's baroque characteristics , the bridge contains an implied but unfulfilled <unk> of VI . In addition , over the coda , the recurring four @-@ bar instrumental passage is partly shifted to a parallel minor , through the use of the more classically orientated A ♭ m chord , rather than its major equivalent as before . Following the instrumental coda , the song ends with the strings playing a <unk> ambiguous cadence , which Everett describes as an unexpected " diminished fourth away from tonic " . 
 = = = Lyrics = = = 
 Inglis writes that while the nursery rhyme form was Harrison 's musical source for " Piggies " , his lyrics adopt a political perspective , creating " a savage attack on the corporate greed of contemporary capitalism " . Conversely , author Andrew Hickey refutes the presence of any " profound moralistic statement " in the song . Instead , he identifies the message as similar in mood to the satirical style of Ray Davies of the Kinks , and the Bonzo Dog Doo @-@ Dah Band . 
 In the first verse , Harrison sings of " the little piggies " , for whom " life is getting worse " . In verse two , " the bigger piggies " are described as " stirring up " the dirt that those smaller animals " crawl " in , while they themselves are dressed in " starched white shirts " . According to music journalist Kit O 'Toole , whereas the song 's harpsichord @-@ led introduction " suggests a salon featuring royalty in their finery " , the lyrics immediately nullify this image in their depiction of pigs toiling in mud , thereby heightening the overall satirical effect . Everett comments that the same contrast between refined instrumentation and uncompromising subject matter was later adopted by Stevie Wonder for his track " Village Ghetto Land " , issued on Songs in the Key of Life ( 1976 ) . 
 During the middle eight , Harrison refers to the privileged pigs in their <unk> who " don 't care what goes on around " ; they appear devoid of empathy , and therefore deserve " a damn good whacking " . In the third verse , Harrison declares that piggies are " everywhere " , leading " piggy lives " . He presents a final image of couples dining , holding their cutlery before devouring bacon . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Recording = = = 
 The Beatles recorded the basic track for " Piggies " at EMI 's Abbey Road Studios in London on 19 September 1968 . After Harrison had performed the song alone on the Esher demo – playing acoustic guitar and whistling over the solo – the use of harpsichord on the official recording came about through happenstance . Acting as a producer in George Martin 's absence on some of the White Album sessions , Chris Thomas noticed the instrument set up in preparation for a later session , for a classical recording , in Abbey Road 's Studio 1 . With Harrison agreeing that a harpsichord part would suit the song , the Beatles ' session was moved there from Studio 2 . 
 The group taped eleven takes of " Piggies " before achieving the requisite performance . The line @-@ up on the track was Harrison on acoustic guitar , Thomas on harpsichord , McCartney on bass and Ringo Starr on tambourine . With only 4 @-@ track recording facilities available in Studio 1 , Lennon was present at the session but did not play on the basic track . Having attended London 's Royal Academy of Music as a child , Thomas performed the harpsichord solo in an authentic classical style , according to Pollack , who highlights how " the melody played by the last three fingers [ of the right hand ] alternates with a repeated note played by the thumb " . 
 = = = Overdubbing = = = 
 On 20 September , the recording was copied over to 8 @-@ track tape in Studio 2 , to allow for overdubbing . Harrison then added his lead vocal , together with harmony vocals on the last verse , creating a mock operatic chorus over the latter section . Through the combination of studio effects and overdubs , his vocal performance on the song consists of three contrasting segments ; in Inglis ' description , these comprise a " naturalistic " approach at the start of the track , " a distorted middle " and chorus singing at the end . To produce the sharp nasal sound over the middle eight , Harrison sang through a filter that limited the signal to a narrow , 3 @.@ 5 @-@ kilohertz band . Described by Everett as " remarkable " , the pitch of Harrison 's vocals in the final verse ranges from a low E ♭ bass note in one of the harmony parts , to a descant falsetto B ♭ 4 in the high harmony part . Lennon created a tape loop of pre @-@ recorded pig noises , sourced from EMI 's library , as well as supplying his own grunting sounds . Drum beats were also added , marking the transition from the solo into the third verse . 
 Final overdubs on the song were carried out at Abbey Road on 10 October , during the last week of recording for The Beatles . Having returned from his extended holiday , Martin wrote a string arrangement for four violins , two violas and two cellos . These parts were recorded during the same orchestral overdubbing session as for Lennon 's track " Glass Onion " . Towards the end of " Piggies " , Harrison added the spoken words " One more time " , before the orchestra played the last two chords . In his overview of the recording , author and critic Tim Riley interprets the " thick <unk> " delivery of this introduction to the " final grand cadence " as Harrison " smearing social elitists with their own symbols of ' high ' culture " . Everett refers to the contrast between the various classical elements and the combination of pig sounds and " rude " final cadence as representing an " Orwellian comparison of pigs to socially horrid , though outwardly refined , tyrants " . 
 Mixing on " Piggies " was completed on 11 October . The mono mix has the animal sounds appearing at different points in the song , relative to the stereo version . In addition , Harrison 's guitar is more prominent in the mono mix . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Apple Records , the Beatles ' EMI @-@ distributed record label , released The Beatles on 22 November 1968 , with " Piggies " sequenced as the fourth track on side two of the double LP . It appeared between two other songs with animal names in their titles – " Blackbird " and " Rocky Raccoon " . The animal @-@ themed sequencing was a deliberate decision on the part of Lennon and McCartney , who prepared the running order of the album 's 30 tracks , with Martin , after Harrison had left for Los Angeles to work with Apple signing Jackie Lomax . 
 According to author Mark Hertsgaard , " Piggies " " [ kept ] the Beatles ' countercultural flame alive " , as the song was embraced as an anti @-@ authoritarian anthem by the counterculture , following a year of protests and civil unrest in many Western countries . Among many such events in the United States , police officers clashed violently with anti @-@ Vietnam War demonstrators at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 1968 . Along with McCartney 's " Rocky Raccoon " , however , the song was also criticised by the radical New Left as an example of the Beatles resorting to whimsical parody instead of directly addressing contemporary issues . 
 Writing in the International Times , Barry Miles found " Piggies " " unsubtle " and likely to appeal to " those involved with Chicago 's pig @-@ police " . William Mann of The Times noted the recurring nature theme throughout the album , from brief mentions of monkeys , lizards , elephants and tigers , to song titles such as " Blackbird " and " Piggies " , and asked of Harrison 's characters : " are they Chicago police or just company directors ? " Melody Maker 's Alan Walsh admired the instrumentation on the recording and deemed " Piggies " to be " The Beatles ' satire track … a kick at upper @-@ class reactionaries or journalists ( or both ) " . In his unfavourable review of the White Album , in The New York Times , Mike Jahn considered that many of the tracks were " either so corny or sung in such a way that it is hard to tell whether [ the Beatles ] are being serious " , among which the words of Harrison 's song served as " an act of lyrical overstatement " . 
 Record Mirror remarked that the birdsong effects of " Blackbird " were replaced by " snorts and grunts " on " Piggies " , which the reviewer described as " a society beef ( or pork if you like ) " in the style of folk singer Roy Harper . Writing in Rolling Stone , Jann Wenner considered the song to be " an amazing choice to follow ' Blackbird ' " , given the contrast between the two pieces – " ' Blackbird ' so encouraging , ' Piggies ' so smug ( though accurate : ' what they need 's a damn good whacking ' ) . Ha ! " Wenner paired it with Starr 's " Don 't Pass Me By " , as lesser songs beside the " superb numbers " found elsewhere on the album , but added that " on their own , they 're totally groovy . " 
 = = Charles Manson interpretation = = 
 Musician and cult leader Charles Manson interpreted several songs on The Beatles as an inducement for his followers , known as the Manson Family , to carry out a series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969 . Inspired by the line " What they need 's a damn good whacking " , Manson adopted " Piggies " as one of the tracks to justify such attacks on the White bourgeoisie . Believing that the Beatles were instructing him through their music , Manson envisioned these attacks as the prelude to an apocalyptic racial war between the establishment and the Black community that would leave him and his followers to rule America on counterculture principles . At the scenes of the murders of Sharon Tate , Leno and Rosemary LaBianca , Gary Hinman and others , the words " Political Piggy " , " Pig " and " Death to Pigs " were written on the walls with the victims ' blood . In the case of the LaBianca murders , items of cutlery were inserted into the bodies in reference to the lyric " Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon " . 
 Speaking to Rolling Stone co @-@ founder David Dalton before his trial , Manson also drew parallels between the pig noises that close the track and a similar sound , followed by machine @-@ gun fire , that appears in Lennon 's White Album sound collage " Revolution 9 " . Like its rival counterculture publications Los Angeles Free Press and Tuesday 's Child , Rolling Stone initially supported Manson , Dalton contending that it was a case of the conservative @-@ minded authorities framing " some poor hippie guru " . According to author Steve Turner , " Piggies " " became notorious " as a result of the Manson Family 's 1971 murder trial , which was successfully prosecuted by Californian attorney Vincent Bugliosi . 
 Harrison was appalled at Manson 's interpretation of the song . He also found it disturbing that Manson came to define the long @-@ haired hippie type in the public 's eyes , after the prosecution 's case had resulted in widespread condemnation of rock music and the idealism associated with the late 1960s hippie movement . In his 1974 book Helter Skelter , Bugliosi says he was denied permission to quote from the lyrics of " Piggies " in the book , yet not so for the lyrics to certain songs by Lennon and McCartney . 
 = = Retrospective assessment and legacy = = 
 Writing in 1977 , Nicholas Schaffner said that , despite the " merciless stereotypes " presented in its lyrics , " Piggies " and Harrison 's three other White Album compositions " firmly established him as a contender " beside the Beatles ' principal songwriters , Lennon and McCartney . Four years later , Philip Norman described the song as " <unk> humorous " . Among more recent Beatles biographers , Ian MacDonald views " Piggies " as a " bludgeoning satire on straight society " , dismissing it as " dreadful " and " an embarrassing blot on [ Harrison 's ] discography " . 
 In his book Revolution : The Making of the Beatles ' White Album , Uncut critic David Quantick recognises the song 's musical qualities – describing it as " a powerful song , full of angry climaxes " with " a fine [ vocal ] performance … [ and ] a charming baroque feel " – yet he bemoans its " arrogant " and misanthropic message . Quantick concludes : " Although the Beatles preached peace and love and meant it , large parts of the White Album indicate that they could be a bit selective about it . " While acknowledging the sinister connotations that the song gained through its association with Manson , Ian Inglis considers that the intentions behind Harrison 's send @-@ up of capitalist consumerism were reasonable , but the track fails due to its lack of " subtlety or charm " . 
 In Andrew Hickey 's opinion , the " bad press " attached to " Piggies " is unjustified , given that Harrison 's " attitude of ' look at those squares with their boring lives ' " was commonplace among rock musicians in the 1960s . Hickey adds that the track contains one of its composer 's best vocal performances and deems the song to be " quite a fun little grotesquerie – a caricature , yes , but nowhere near as mean @-@ spirited as its detractors would claim " . Reviewing Harrison 's career in a 2002 issue of Goldmine magazine , Dave Thompson termed " Piggies " " whimsically foreboding " and grouped it with late @-@ period Beatles songs such as " Something " and " Long , Long , Long " that anticipated Harrison 's successes as a solo artist after the group 's break @-@ up in 1970 . Tim Riley describes the song 's narrative as " smug anti @-@ elitism outdone only by the dourness of John 's ' Glass Onion ' and ' Sexy Sadie ' " . With regard to George Martin 's contention that The Beatles should have been edited down to a single disc , however , he views " Piggies " as one of the White Album " essentials " contributed by Harrison , along with " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " and " Savoy Truffle " . 
 Among reviewers of the 2009 remastered album , Sean <unk> of Beats Per Minute cites the track as evidence that , despite the disharmonious atmosphere within the group during 1968 , " All four Beatles were working at their highest levels " , with Harrison " at his most acerbic on ' Piggies ' " . Mark Richardson of Pitchfork Media highlights the song as one of The Beatles ' " iffy jokes " that nevertheless succeed , due to the high standard of the band 's songwriting and the effective sequencing of the double album .

 Theo Bikel , an actor , folk singer and activist who was a delegate at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago , covered " Piggies " on his 1969 album A New Day . Reviewing the opening night of Bikel 's residency at the Troubadour in Los Angeles , in June 1970 , Billboard magazine described the song as one of " the more meaningful titles " that the singer had adopted from the work of popular acts such as the Beatles , the Rolling Stones and Donovan . The 1976 television adaptation of Vincent Bugliosi 's book , also titled Helter Skelter , features several Beatles songs , including " Piggies " and Harrison 's White Album track " Long , Long , Long " , both performed by the group <unk> . The song was also covered by <unk> <unk> , leader singer of the anarcho @-@ punk band Chumbawamba . Titled " Piggies in Revolution 9 " , <unk> 's version appeared on the 1989 album Fuck EMI , a multi @-@ artist compilation protesting EMI 's business practices , particularly the company 's involvement in cruise missile production . 
 Having become available on bootleg albums from 1991 onwards , Harrison 's 1968 demo was released on the Beatles ' Anthology 3 compilation in October 1996 . Recorded on an Ampex four @-@ track recorder , the demo features Harrison playing two acoustic guitar parts , and a double @-@ tracked lead vocal . Harrison performed " Piggies " throughout his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton and at his Natural Law Party concert in London in April 1992 . With synthesizers replicating the classical arrangement , a version recorded at the Tokyo Dome on 15 December 1991 appears on Harrison 's Live in Japan double album . 
 Phish included " Piggies " in their performance of The Beatles on Halloween 1994 , which was released in 2002 as Live Phish Volume 13 . The harpsichord from the original Beatles recording was mashed with Jay @-@ Z 's " Change Clothes " for a track on Danger Mouse 's The Grey Album in 2004 . For the Beatles ' 2006 remix album Love , compiled by Martin and his son Giles , the harpsichord and cello parts were mixed into the ending of " Strawberry Fields Forever " . 
 The song was covered by <unk> for The White Album Recovered , a CD distributed with the September 2008 issue of Mojo magazine . That same year , former Cars keyboardist Greg Hawkes issued a ukulele rendition on his album The Beatles Uke .

 The Beguiling is a comic shop in Toronto , Ontario , Canada . It specializes in underground and alternative comics , classic comic strip reprints , and foreign comics . It has built an international reputation for focusing on and promoting non @-@ superhero comics in the superhero @-@ dominated North American comic book market . 
 The store has made effort to promote comics culture in Toronto by organizing the annual Toronto Comic Arts Festival ( TCAF ) in <unk> with the Toronto Public Library , and by opening sister store Little Island Comics , the first North American comic shop aimed exclusively at children . 
 = = History = = 
 Founded in 1987 by Steve Solomos and Sean Scoffield on Harbord Street near the University of Toronto in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , The Beguiling quickly built a reputation for the diversity of its stock , focused on art @-@ oriented , avant @-@ garde , underground and alternative comics — " anything that is even peripherally comic book @-@ oriented " , according to current owner Peter Birkemoe . In the earliest days , much of the store 's income was made through mail order , as the material it dealt in was not mainstream . It also built a reputation for stocking the works of cartoonists such as Chester Brown and Julie Doucet , whose comics most stores would not handle due to the controversial nature of their contents . Well @-@ known Toronto @-@ based cartoonists such as the trio of Brown , Seth and Joe Matt became associated with the store , and sometimes depicted it in their comics . Others such as Jay Stephens made it their shop of choice . 
 In 1998 , Solomos and Scoffield decided to devote their time to creating art ( and later film production ) , and ownership was passed to Peter Birkemoe and Shane Chung , who expanded operations . In 1992 it relocated to a two @-@ floor Victorian building in <unk> Village in Toronto , and has since branched out into selling to libraries , organizing the Toronto Comic Arts Festival , and running another location , called Little Island Comics , which caters to children . 
 = = Description and reputation = = 
 The Beguiling is " a store with an agenda " , according to Birkemoe , and has been derided for some for its perceived elitism , which stems in part from its sponsoring of Crash , a journal of comics criticism that mainly condemned bad comics . Others , such as comics historian Charles Hatfield , have praised the store for its sense of history , saying , " You always leave the shop with a larger sense of what comics are about . " The Beguiling is patronized by an international audience . The store has made the top five retailer list in The Comics Journal , and among the awards it has received , it shared the inaugural Eisner Spirit of Retailing Award in 1993 , and it won the Joe Shuster Awards ' Harry Kremer Retailer Award in 2010 .

 In 2003 , Peter Birkemoe and Chris Butcher of The Beguiling first organized the Toronto Comic Arts Festival ( TCAF ) . Unusual in the world of comics conventions , TCAF is a free @-@ admission event . It focuses on alternative and independent comics , but includes other creative arts besides comics . Rather than being like a traditional comics convention , it is patterned after European festivals such as Angoulême , and the American Small Press Expo . The organizers considered Toronto to be a hotbed of alternative cartooning , but were concerned that most Torontonians associated comic books with superheroes . Their stated goal was " to present the quality and prestige of ... local and international artists in a package that 's respected and recognized " . The festival was biannual until 2009 , when in partnership with the Toronto Public Library it became an annual event . Starting that year , the festival took place at the Toronto Reference Library .

 As most North American comic shops focus on teenage and adult customers , and The Beguiling itself mainly on adults , the owners wanted to fill a void by opening the first children 's comic shop in North America , and possibly the world . Little Island Comics opened 6 September 2011 at 742 Bathurst Street in the Annex , close to The Beguiling . The shop was designed with children in mind , with bright colours and shelves at child @-@ height .

Constructed of red brick with sandstone trim and sandstone lintels and sills on the windows , the building has a foliate terracotta plaque bearing its name and date of construction . The fire station was closed as a firehouse in 1974 , when the current Fire Station Number 4 on Cottage Street opened . The interior of the building was greatly modified to accommodate offices and meeting rooms by the time of its listing on the national register . As of 2014 , the building is being used by the Catholic Charities of Providence . Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 .

A pair of matching single @-@ story wings with gable @-@ on @-@ hipped roofs project from the long sides of the building . The building has small hip @-@ roofed porches with arched openings on the main entrance and Broadway facing sides . Though constructed of red brick and pinkish mortar , sandstone was used for the window sills and lintels and the station 's trim . The building has detailed terracotta work , with an ornate foliate name and date plaque on the front gable and a string course at the base of the corbeled main entrance . Above the plaque is a semi @-@ circular window , and another round @-@ headed window is on the northern side . The northwest corner has a square hose drying / bell tower that also has its own round headed window . The station has been modified ; its two fire engine doors have been removed and replaced with modern garage doors . The pyramidal roof on the belfry which crowned the bell tower was " recently " removed at the time of its NRHP nomination in 1983 . 
 The interior of the firehouse has been greatly altered in the conversion to office and meeting room space by the time of its National Register of Historic Places nomination . The surviving details included the Queen Anne staircase and sunken panel doors . Though the interior has been greatly modified , it did not prevent its listing on the historic register .

 In 1974 , Fire Station Number 4 was replaced by a new Fire Station Number 4 located on 397 Cottage Street . This was not to be the only replacement of the firehouses which would be reused through the Community Development Block Grant program , which assisted in the adaptation in the late 1970s and into the 1980s . By the time of its nomination , the fire station had been re @-@ purposed as office and meeting space for city agencies .

 The IX Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race , held on 8 April 2007 at the Sepang International Circuit and the second race of the 2007 Formula One season . Reigning world champion Fernando Alonso won the race from second on the grid , with McLaren teammate Lewis Hamilton finishing second . This marked McLaren 's first one @-@ two finish since the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix . Previous race winner Kimi Räikkönen finished third . Räikkönen 's Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa started the race from pole position , but was passed by both McLarens in the first two corners of the first lap , eventually finishing in fifth place behind BMW 's Nick Heidfeld . 
 The Malaysian race was the first at which the two different tyre types used during the race were differentiated by a white stripe painted into the tread of the softer type , helping spectators to understand the race strategy of each driver .

 Pre @-@ race testing 
 The 2007 Malaysian Grand Prix was held at the Sepang International Circuit near Kuala Lumpur on 8 April , with practice and qualification for the race held on the two preceding days . It was preceded by a test session at the Sepang circuit attended by all the teams except the small Dutch team Spyker , who believed that it would not be possible to try upgrades on their car in time for the race . The test was scheduled to begin on 27 March 2007 and last for three days . The teams , which are all based in Europe , arrived at the test directly from the Australian Grand Prix , held nine days previously . Robert Kubica ( BMW Sauber ) , Kimi Räikkönen ( Scuderia Ferrari ) and Lewis Hamilton ( McLaren ) set the fastest times on the first , second and third days of the test , respectively ; the final day saw partly wet conditions . Due to the poor weather , the teams agreed to extend the testing by one day , with Heikki Kovalainen ( Renault F1 ) fastest . 
 Dispute over customer cars 
 The issue of teams using ' customer cars ' , that is cars obtained from other teams , surfaced before the race when Spyker protested the Scuderia Toro Rosso ( STR ) team 's use of cars they claimed had been designed by STR 's sister team , Red Bull Racing . The Concorde Agreement , which dictates the terms by which the teams compete in the Formula One world championship , requires teams to design their own cars . The Malaysian stewards rejected the protest , with the Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA , the sport 's governing body ) stating that " it would be entirely inappropriate for the Stewards to involve themselves in a matter being dealt with at the instigation and election of the <unk> , Spyker " . Red Bull threatened legal action over Spyker 's possession of their car designs to use as evidence against STR , but nothing materialised . The FIA did not investigate how Spyker obtained Red Bull 's car designs . 
 Flexible floors 
 The FIA introduced more stringent tests on the cars at the Malaysian race to ensure floor mounting systems used by Ferrari and BMW Sauber were not in breach of the regulations . After the first race of the season in Australia , the McLaren team had requested clarification of the rules regarding systems that allowed the front of the car 's <unk> to move upwards under aerodynamic loading at high speed . Autosport magazine reported that this movement would potentially increase straight line speed . Massa and Räikkönen said the performance of the Ferrari F2007 car would not be compromised in any way by the required modifications . 
 Tyre markings 
 The Malaysian race was the first at which the tyre compounds used on the cars were differentiated by a white stripe painted in the tyre treads . Since the beginning of the 2007 Formula One season , teams had been obliged to use two different kinds of tyre on each car during the race : a ' prime ' tyre and an ' option ' tyre . The prime tyre has a harder rubber compound and the option tyre a softer one . In general terms , a softer tyre is likely to grip better and provide a higher cornering speed . Conversely , a harder tyre will often be slower , but may last longer . Formula One cars typically use between two and four sets of tyres during a race and using harder tyres may allow fewer pit stops to change tyres . Track conditions , the car characteristics or driving style can reduce or even reverse these differences . In Australia two weeks earlier , the softer tyres were marked with a small white circle to facilitate understanding of each driver 's tyre strategy , but commentators and spectators were unable to distinguish the two compounds even at slow speeds . The idea of the white stripe was tested during the test session a week before the Malaysian round of the season . The white stripe was applied with paint marker pens . Over the weekend 160 pens were used . Overall reaction to this system was positive , with the Williams team 's technical director Sam Michael , who came up with the initial idea , calling it a " pretty good solution " . 
 = = = Practice = = = 
 The race was preceded by three practice sessions . Ferrari 's Felipe Massa set the pace in the first of two 90 @-@ minute practice sessions on Friday , with a time of 1 : 34 @.@ 972 , edging out McLaren 's Fernando Alonso by three @-@ tenths of a second . Alonso 's teammate Hamilton was third , with Ferrari 's other driver , Räikkönen , just behind in fourth . Nico Rosberg , Mark Webber , Jarno Trulli , Kazuki Nakajima , Ralf Schumacher , and Robert Kubica rounded out the top ten . 
 Massa was comfortably fastest in Friday 's second practice , setting a time of 1 : 35 @.@ 780 . The Renault team improved dramatically from first practice , with Giancarlo Fisichella second and Kovalainen third . Räikkönen was again fourth , followed by Rosberg , Alexander Wurz , Kubica and Schumacher . The McLarens of Hamilton and Alonso dropped to ninth and 12th respectively . McLaren boss Ron Dennis played down the times , saying the team was concentrating on tyre evaluation . 
 Dennis 's lack of concern was vindicated on Saturday , with Hamilton setting the fastest time in practice with a lap of 1 : 34 @.@ 811 . Massa finished the session a tenth of a second behind , with third placed Alonso a further half second behind . Kubica , Räikkönen , Rosberg and Heidfeld followed , with Super Aguri driver Anthony Davidson eighth fastest . Super Aguri are regarded as a sister team to the Honda F1 works team , who set only the 17th and 19th fastest times . The 2007 Super Aguri is widely thought to be an updated version of Honda 's 2006 car .

 For more details on the qualification process for this race , see 2006 Rule Changes : Qualifying 
 The qualifying session to determine the starting order for the race is held in three parts , six cars are eliminated after each of the first two parts . In the first part , the Spykers of Christijan Albers and Adrian Sutil set the slowest times of all . Spyker technical director Mike Gascoyne admitted that the team had " made a mistake " in missing the test at Sepang a week earlier . Scott Speed ( STR ) , Anthony Davidson ( Super Aguri ) , Rubens Barrichello ( Honda ) and Alex Wurz ( Williams ) were also eliminated . Davidson blamed STR driver Vitantonio Liuzzi for obstructing his qualifying lap , stating " he was pretty aware I was behind him " . Wurz was slowed by gear @-@ selection problems in his Williams . At the front , McLaren driver Alonso set the fastest time with a 1 : 34 @.@ 942 . His teammate Hamilton was second fastest , with the Ferraris third and fifth , split by Kubica 's BMW . 
 Rain threatened during the second part . Although it did not materialise , all the drivers posted quick laps early on to avoid having to set a time on a wet track . Alonso was again fastest with a 1 : 34 @.@ 057 . Hamilton , both Ferraris , BMW Saubers , and Toyotas , as well as Rosberg ( Williams ) and Webber ( Red Bull ) also passed through to the final part . Kovalainen ( Renault ) , Fisichella ( Renault ) , Coulthard ( Red Bull ) , Sato ( Super Aguri ) , Button ( Honda ) and Liuzzi ( STR ) were eliminated . 2006 champions Renault failed to get either car into the final part . Team engineering director Pat Symonds noted that " ... the overall level of performance is disappointing , but we now have to knuckle down and make the most of the situation we find ourselves in . " Button claimed Honda 's grid position of 15th was the " maximum we could possibly get " . 
 In the final part of qualifying , Massa set the fastest time , taking pole position from second placed Alonso in the last few seconds as rain began to fall , with Räikkönen completing the top three . Massa 's lap of 1 : 35 @.@ 043 marked tyre company Bridgestone 's 100th pole position in Formula One . Hamilton came fourth , over half a second behind the leading three . He conceded inexperience was to blame , saying that there were " some spots of rain on my visor , so I had to sort of let off " . Heidfeld qualified fifth , ahead of Nico Rosberg in sixth and teammate Kubica in seventh . The Toyotas of Trulli and Schumacher were eighth and ninth , with Webber completing the top ten . 
 Race stewards initially imposed a 10 @-@ place penalty on Coulthard and Barrichello , for changing their engines prior to qualification . Since 2006 , the engines of Formula One cars are required to last for two races . However , after further investigation they rescinded Coulthard 's penalty , as he had retired from the previous race and his change had been made before the start of the race weekend . Barrichello 's penalty stood .

 In contrast to the rain @-@ affected practice and qualifying sessions , the track was dry for the duration of the race . All of the drivers except Jenson Button , Jarno Trulli and the two Red Bull drivers started on the softer option tyre . The first lap was eventful : Alonso started better than polesitter Massa and was able to take the inside line into turn one and gain the lead . Hamilton passed Räikkönen for third into the first corner , then drove round the outside of Massa into turn two to take second place . Meanwhile , the suspension on Adrian Sutil 's Spyker failed at turn four , causing it to collide with Button 's Honda and retire from the race . Button continued after making an early pitstop to repair the damage . Liuzzi and Sato also collided at turn four , causing Liuzzi to pit for a new front wing . After the race the drivers blamed each other for the incident . 
 During the early laps , Massa appeared to have a faster car than Hamilton , and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren on the inside of turn four . His first attempt was on lap three , but Hamilton braked late and kept ahead of Massa into the following corner . Massa tried again at the same place on the next two laps . He passed Hamilton briefly into the turn on lap five , but overshot the corner and ran wide onto the grass . He dropped to fifth , behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW 's Nick Heidfeld . Hamilton apologised after the race for ' tricking ' Massa into the move . Albers , in the sole remaining Spyker , retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire . 
 While the two Ferraris were delayed behind Hamilton , Alonso was pulling away at the front , setting fastest laps on laps seven and fifteen . On lap 12 , Robert Kubica was the first man to pit for fuel and fresh tyres , however he reported traction control problems four laps later and lost places . Alonso had extended his lead over Hamilton to 15 seconds by the first round of pitstops . He had experienced radio problems before refuelling , but these were fixed during the stop . The Renaults were circulating in eighth and tenth by the pit stops , with Fisichella ahead of Kovalainen . Button was one of the few drivers who started on the slower harder tyre and was dropping down the field , as Takuma Sato passed the Briton . All of the front runners were on the same tyre strategy , with Räikkönen being the first front runner to pit . He found himself behind Fisichella as he exited . A short pit stop by Hamilton enabled him to come out of the pits ahead of the Renault , leaving a car between himself and Räikkönen during the pit window . Heidfeld 's late stop on lap 22 helped him stay ahead of Massa . The top five positions remained unchanged , however Hamilton 's different strategy enabled him to escape Räikkönen and close in on leader Alonso at a second per lap . Despite pitting on lap 20 , he set the fastest lap of the race on lap 22 in 1 : 36 @.@ 701 . 
 Kubica dropped to 13th as his traction control fault worsened , and a train of cars that wanted to pass developed behind him . Kovalainen 's performance was much better than at the previous round in Melbourne , and he attempted to pass Jarno Trulli for eighth . The top five again remained the same after the second round of stops . However , Hamilton 's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop , allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds . Nico Rosberg , running in sixth place after the stops , was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43 . David Coulthard also retired after problems with his brake pedal , the same problem that he experienced in the Friday practice session . 
 Alonso was able to extend his advantage in the closing stages , winning the race by 17 seconds . Although experiencing pressure from Räikkönen who was faster on the harder tyres , Hamilton was able to maintain second place behind Alonso , with Räikkönen claiming the final podium position . This was McLaren 's first victory since the 2005 Japanese Grand Prix , and the team 's first one @-@ two since the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix . Heidfeld and Massa secured fourth and fifth places respectively , 15 seconds behind Räikkönen . Heidfeld said later that beating Massa was " a fantastic experience " . Fisichella finished sixth , and claimed it felt like a podium given the performance of the car . Trulli was seventh , and rookie Kovalainen scored his first F1 point in eighth . Wurz managed to come through from 19th to ninth , with his opening stint elevating him to 11th place by his first pit stop . Although he claimed no points , he said later " it bodes well for Williams 's chances in the rest of the season " . tenth placed Mark Webber was the final driver to finish on the same lap as the leaders . Honda finished outside the points in 11th and 12th , with Barrichello ahead of Button . Despite the problems Button said he believed the team had made " a small step forward " . The Hondas were followed by Sato , Speed , Schumacher , Davidson and Liuzzi . 
 Alonso admitted he was surprised to win a race so early in his McLaren career , adding that winning for two different teams was very special . Hamilton said afterwards that this was his hardest race to date , while Räikkönen admitted he " did not have enough speed on the straight line to try to challenge either [ Hamilton or Alonso ] " . Räikkönen also had to protect his engine from overheating , caused by a water @-@ leak in the closing stages of the Melbourne race , with Räikkönen stating Ferrari had to " play on the safe side of that engine " . After their disappointing Malaysian race , Ferrari boss Jean Todt stated that they " will try to do a better job " in the next round in Bahrain .

 The MacBook was a brand of notebook computers manufactured by Apple Inc. from May 2006 to July 2011 , and relaunched in 2015 . It replaced the iBook series and 12 @-@ inch PowerBook series of notebooks as a part of the Apple @-@ Intel transition from PowerPC . Positioned as the low end of the MacBook family , below the premium ultra @-@ portable MacBook Air and the powerful MacBook Pro , the MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets . It was the best @-@ selling Macintosh ever . For five months in 2008 , it was the best @-@ selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores . Collectively , the MacBook brand is the " world 's top @-@ selling line of premium laptops . " 
 There have been four separate designs of the MacBook . The original model used a combination of polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after the iBook G4 . The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15 @-@ inch MacBook Pro ; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop 's unibody aluminum casing , but omitted FireWire , which hurt sales . A third design , introduced in late 2009 , had a polycarbonate unibody casing and no FireWire ports . 
 On July 20 , 2011 , the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchase as it had been effectively superseded by the MacBook Air whose starting price was lowered . Apple continued to sell the MacBook to educational institutions until February 2012 . 
 A new , redesigned MacBook line was launched on March 9 , 2015 . Available in silver , gold or space grey , it is thinner than the MacBook Air and removes the traditional MagSafe charging port ( along with all other ports , except the headphone jack ) in favor of the multi @-@ purpose USB Type @-@ C port . It also features a Retina Display . On April 19 , 2016 , Apple updated the 12 @-@ inch Retina MacBook with new sixth @-@ generation Intel Core M processors , longer battery life and a new rose gold option .

 The original MacBook , available in black or white colors , was released on June 28 , 2006 , and used the Intel Core Duo processor and <unk> chipset , with Intel 's GMA 950 integrated graphics on a 667 MHz front side bus . Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the Core 2 Duo processor and the <unk> chipset , with Intel 's GMA <unk> integrated graphics on an 800 MHz system bus . Sales of the black polycarbonate MacBook ceased in October 2008 , after the introduction of the aluminum MacBook . 
 While thicker than its predecessor – the iBook G4 – the MacBook is wider than the 12 @-@ inch model due to its widescreen display . In addition , the MacBook was one of the first ( the first being the MacBook Pro ) to adopt Apple 's MagSafe power connector and it replaced the iBook 's mini @-@ VGA display port with a mini @-@ DVI display port . The iBook 's discrete graphics chip was initially replaced by an integrated Intel GMA solution , though the latest revisions of the MacBook were upgraded with the more powerful Nvidia GeForce 9400M and later the <unk> . 
 While the MacBook Pro largely followed the industrial design standard set by the PowerBook G4 , the MacBook was Apple 's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display , the sunken keyboard design and the non @-@ mechanical magnetic latch . With the late 2007 revision , the keyboard received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the iMac , by adding the same keyboard short @-@ cut to control multimedia , and removing the embedded numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys . 
 A more expensive black model was offered until the introduction of the unibody aluminum MacBook . The polycarbonate MacBook was the only Macintosh notebook ( until the new 2015 model ) to be offered in more than one color since the iBook G3 ( Clamshell ) .

 The polycarbonate Intel MacBook is easier for users to fix or upgrade than its predecessor .

 In February 2007 , the MacBook was recalled because the graphics card and hard drive caused the computer to overheat , forcing the unit to shut down . 
 Some early polycarbonate MacBook models suffered from random shutdowns ; Apple released a firmware update to resolve these random shutdowns . 
 There were also cases reported of discolored or chipping <unk> . There were many instances of the edges of the palm rest and screen bezel splitting and thin strips peeling off . In such cases , Apple asked affected owners to contact <unk> . 
 There were problems with batteries on some models from 2007 not being read by the MacBook . This is caused by a logic board fault and not a fault with the battery . 
 In February 2010 , Apple announced a recall for MacBooks bought between 2006 – 2007 for hard drive issues . This is caused by heat and other problems .

 On October 14 , 2008 , Apple announced a MacBook featuring a new Nvidia chipset at a Cupertino , California press conference with the tagline : " The spotlight turns to notebooks " . 
 The chipset brought a 1066 MHz system bus , use of DDR3 system memory , and integrated Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics up to five times faster than the original MacBooks ' Intel chipset . Other changes include a display which uses LED backlights ( which replace the fluorescent tube backlights used in the previous model which contain mercury ) and arsenic @-@ free glass , a new Mini DisplayPort ( replacing the polycarbonate MacBook 's mini @-@ DVI port ) , a multi @-@ touch glass trackpad which also acts as the mouse button , and the removal of the FireWire 400 port ( thus it doesn 't support Target Disk Mode , used for data transfers or operating system repairs without booting the system ) .

 Although Gizmodo concluded it to be " our favorite MacBook to date , " they did claim , at this time , its display was inferior to that found on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air , alleging a smaller viewing angle , washed @-@ out colors , and dimmer backlighting .

Charlie Sorrel of Wired News reached an identical conclusion about the MacBook display , citing its poor contrast and lack of vertical angle in comparison with the MacBook Pro and even the older white MacBook . Peter Cohen wrote an article discussing the loss of the FireWire port for Macworld , saying " The absence of FireWire ports is certainly an inconvenience for some users .

 = Dutch brick = 
 Dutch brick is a type of brick made in the Netherlands , or similar brick , and an architectural style of building with brick developed by the Dutch . The brick , made from clay dug from river banks or dredged from river beds and fired over a long period of time , was known for its durability and appearance . 
 Traditional Dutch brick architecture is characterized by rounded or stepped gables . The brick was imported as ballast into Great Britain and the colonies in the east of America . Trinity College , Dublin , Ireland , founded in 1591 , was originally built of red Dutch brick . Dutch brickmakers emigrated to New Netherland in America , where they built kilns for firing bricks locally . Bricks were being burned in New Amsterdam ( New York ) by 1628 , but the imported bricks were of better quality . At first the bricks were used only for chimneys , but they were later used to face the lower story of the house , and then the entire house . Most of the surviving " Dutch Colonial " houses in New York do not in fact follow Dutch architectural practices , but there are several examples in Albany County which do . 
 Bricks were also exported by the Dutch for major buildings in their colonies in the east and around the world . The Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town , South Africa , was built in 1666 , and its entrance was made of the small yellow bricks called <unk> ( IJssel stones ) . Christ Church in Malacca , Malaysia , the oldest Dutch church building outside the Netherlands , was made of Dutch bricks that had been brought as ballast in ships from the Netherlands , coated with Chinese plaster . 
 = = Background and manufacture = = 
 The word " brick " may be of Dutch origin . A 1901 dictionary of architecture defines " brick " as " a regularly shaped piece of clay hardened in the sun or by the heat of a kiln and intended for building ; commonly one of very many pieces of uniform size . " The " Dutch Brick " is described as " a hard , light @-@ coloured brick originally made in Holland [ sic ] and used in England for pavements ; hence a similar brick made in England . " 
 Until well into the twentieth century the manufacture of brick in the Netherlands ( and elsewhere ) used manual labor mostly , and the low @-@ paid workers involved in the industry were as marginal socially as the manufacturing industry geographically — the raw materials were gathered on river banks , and the firing of the bricks took place well away from towns and farms to lessen any nuisance caused by fire and smoke . Workers , as was noted in municipal reports , often already belonged to the lower levels of society and were frequently simply let go at the end of the season , adding to the municipal burdens : " As the number of brick kilns increases , so does poverty , " according to the 1873 report of the <unk> municipality , near Nijmegen , on the Waal river . 
 The clay for the bricks was dug from river banks ( of the Waal , Rhine , and IJssel rivers ) and other open @-@ air locations , and was left outside ( in a mound called the <unk> ) through the winter so that any organic material could decay ; the weather ( rain , frost , drought ) helped make the clay more manageable . At the end of this period the clay was mixed with sand and other materials , a process done by foot , by workers stomping on the clay . It was then molded into the proper shape by an artisan , the <unk> ( " brickmaker " ) . Children handed the brickmaker the raw material and removed the shaped bricks . Child labor was common in the industry : until well into the nineteenth century children eight years old and younger worked 16 hours per day , and children four years old stacked and carried bricks for hours at a stretch . Molds were moistened with water and strewn with sand to enable the shaped brick to be more easily removed . The " raw " or " green " stones were laid out in long rows to dry and when they were dry enough they were stood up on their side so the bottom could dry ; this work was often done by women and children . Often it was the women who did the much heavier labor of moving the dried bricks to the ovens , hauling wheelbarrows with loads of up to 80 kilograms , and stacking and preparing the ovens and tending to the fire ( which burned peat or coal ) . Ovens came in two types — a single @-@ use construction of the kind used in the production of charcoal , and a more permanent type , basically consisting of two walls one meter and a half thick . Ovens could hold up to a million bricks . Masonry bricks were fired between 900 ° C ( 1 @,@ 650 ° F ) and 1 @,@ 125 ° C ( 2 @,@ 057 ° F ) , <unk> between 1 @,@ 150 ° C ( 2 @,@ 100 ° F ) and 1 @,@ 250 ° C ( 2 @,@ 280 ° F ) . Typically , bricks were baked at low heat for two weeks to remove all remaining moisture from the clay , and then for four weeks at a higher temperature , followed by two weeks of cooling down . 
 Since the <unk> was partially vitrified by being fired at a higher temperature it was harder than the standard . <unk> were imported into England for use as paving . 
 Small , yellow Dutch bricks used to be imported into the United States , and as of 1840 there were still old buildings in New York faced in these bricks . They were considered superior in appearance and in durability . An 1888 report noted that " in New York and other Atlantic cities we find houses built of brick brought from Holland [ sic ] fully two hundred years ago , without a flaw or sign of decay , and apparently as firm and sound as when first laid in the wall . " 
 = = Europe = = 
 Houses found today in Zeeland are closer in appearance to the fine Dutch brick houses of New York than are houses from other parts of the Netherlands . Brick farm houses built separately from barns are found in Zeeland , but none have survived in other locations . Unlike the common practice in New York , the farm houses in Zeeland do not have separate outside doors for each room . The Dutch also used bricks to pave the roads , or <unk> , in the Netherlands . 
 By the 1640s the Dutch were considered to be the leaders in Europe both in making bricks and in bricklaying . The Summer Garden in Saint Petersburg , Russia , exhibits the work of Dutch brickmakers and bricklayers . Saint Michael 's Castle , built in Saint Petersburg between 1797 and 1801 for the Emperor Paul I , is " an enormous quadrangular pile , of red Dutch brisk , rising from a massy basement of hewn granite . " Sans Souci , the palace built for Frederick the Great in Potsdam , was built with a facade of rich red Dutch brick . 
 In recent years the Dutch brick industry has attracted unwelcome attention from the European Union ( EU ) competition authorities . In the early 1990s the industry had excess capacity due to technological advances , competition from other materials and an economic slowdown . Producers with combined market share of 90 % agreed to reduce capacity , shutting down the older and inefficient plants . The producers compensated those who closed plants . However , the agreement also included fixing production quotas and fining members who produced more than their quota . The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU .

 Imported Dutch brick was often used in buildings in England in the 17th and 18th centuries . In Dartmouth , a house built in 1664 for mariner Robert <unk> had traditional timber @-@ framed architecture but included elaborate star @-@ shaped chimney stacks made from imported Dutch brick . Houses in Topsham , Devon , also used Dutch brick for chimneys , window heads and dressing . One house from the late 17th century in Dutch Court in Topsham is built entirely of Dutch brick . The ports of Exeter and Topsham both shipped wool to the Netherlands , and the returning ships brought bricks as ballast from Amsterdam or Rotterdam . 
 Trinity College , Dublin , Ireland , founded in 1591 , was originally built of red Dutch brick . <unk> House in Naas , County Kildare , Ireland , was built by John Allen for Thomas Wentworth , 1st Earl of Strafford ( 1593 – 1641 ) using Dutch brick " of the most superior manufacture " . The Red House in <unk> , Ireland , was built of red Dutch brick in 1710 by the Dutch architect <unk> for the Uniacke family .

 In general , bricks were not imported to the American colonies . Probably none were imported to Virginia and Maryland , but in New England there was one possible example in New Haven , and there are records documenting the shipment of 10 @,@ 000 bricks to Massachusetts Bay in 1628 and several thousand bricks being shipped to New Sweden . It is possible that the terms " Dutch brick " and " English brick " referred to the size of the locally @-@ made bricks , with the Dutch bricks being the smaller . However , in New Netherland there are records of brick being imported from the Netherlands as ballast in 1633 , and of continued shipments until the American Revolution ( 1765 – 1783 ) . Bricks were being burned in New Amsterdam ( New York ) by 1628 , but the imported bricks were of better quality . At first , the bricks were used only for chimneys , but they were later used to face the lower story of the house , and then the entire house . 
 Dutch brickmakers emigrated to New Netherland , where they built kilns for firing bricks locally . In New Amsterdam , brick was used for the director general 's house , the counting house , the city tavern and other important buildings . Houses were gable @-@ ended , often with stepped designs , and the bricks ranged in color from yellow or red to blue or black . An account of New York published in 1685 said , " The town is broad , built with Dutch brick , consisting of above five hundred houses , the meanest not valued under an hundred pounds . " A New Englander who visited New York in 1704 , forty years after the Dutch had yielded the town to the British , admired the appearance of the glazed brickwork of the houses of " diverse <unk> and laid in Checkers " . In 1845 there was still a one @-@ story Dutch brick house built in 1696 in Flatbush , Brooklyn . The date and the owner 's initials were formed by blue and red glazed bricks . 
 A view of part of Albany , New York , as it was in 1814 shows a mixture of Dutch , English and Federal styles , although Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English @-@ style houses . One house in the Dutch style was said to date from the American Revolution . If so , it would have been one of the last genuine Dutch @-@ style houses to be built in the United States , reflecting the conservative Dutch culture of Albany at that time . 
 Most of the surviving " Dutch Colonial " houses in New York do not in fact follow Dutch architectural practices , but there are seven in Albany County that do . The houses have a wood frame with brick walls as a decorative shell . They each have two parapet gables edged with " mouse <unk> " ornamental brickwork . All the Dutch brick buildings used iron wall anchors spread across several bricks to tie the brick shell to the wooden frame of the house . Sometimes the anchor gives the date of construction . The brickwork of the houses incorporated various designs including spear shapes and a form like a fleur @-@ de @-@ lis .

 Dutch bricks and brickwork were also imported and utilized in other colonies throughout the Dutch Empire in Asia , Africa , and the Caribbean . Fort Zeelandia was built on a small island off Tainan in Formosa ( Taiwan ) between 1624 and 1634 after the Dutch acquired Formosa from China as a trading colony . It was built using bricks from Batavia ( Jakarta ) , where the Dutch East India Company had its headquarters . After a siege in 1662 , the Dutch surrendered the fort to Koxinga , a Ming dynasty general . The fort was destroyed by an explosion in 1873 when a shell from a British warship blew up the ammunition storehouse . The masonry was later used for other purposes . All that remains is part of the southern wall . 
 The Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town , South Africa , was built in 1666 . The gateway was built in 1682 , with a pediment and two pilasters of grey @-@ blue stone , and an entrance made of the small yellow bricks called <unk> ( IJssel stones ) . 
 Christ Church , Malacca , Malaysia , is the oldest Dutch church building outside the Netherlands . It was built by the local Dutch burghers after the town had been taken from the Portuguese , and was completed in 1753 . The church covers 82 by 41 feet ( 25 by 12 m ) , with a ceiling 40 feet ( 12 m ) high . The foundations were local laterite blocks . The walls , which are massive , were made of Dutch bricks that had been brought as ballast in ships from the Netherlands , and they were coated with Chinese plaster . 
 On the island of Sint Eustatius in the Netherlands Antilles , the houses were built from local volcanic stone , from imported wood , or from red or yellow Dutch brick imported from the Netherlands . The traditional masonry houses were both large and solid . The country house of Johannes de Graaff , who commanded Sint Eustatius from 1776 to 1781 , features a 33 @.@ 6 @-@ by @-@ 9 @.@ 7 @-@ foot ( 10 @.@ 2 by 3 @.@ 0 m ) duck pond made of brick .

 Judge John Deed is a British legal drama television series produced by the BBC in association with One @-@ Eyed Dog for BBC One . It was created by G.F. Newman and stars Martin Shaw as Justice Sir John Deed , a High Court judge who tries to seek real justice in the cases before him . It also stars Jenny Seagrove as the barrister Jo Mills QC , frequently the object of Deed 's desire . A pilot episode was broadcast on 9 January 2001 , followed by the first full series on 26 November 2001 . The sixth and last series concluded on 18 January 2007 . The programme then went on an indefinite break after Shaw became involved in another television programme , and he and Seagrove expressed a wish for the format of the series to change before they filmed new episodes . By 2009 , the series had officially been cancelled . 
 The factual accuracy of the series is often criticised by legal professionals and journalists ; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court . The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury not to let the series influence their view of trials — referring to an episode where Deed <unk> rules when called up for jury service . A complaint was made by a viewer about one episode claiming biased and incorrect information about the MMR vaccine , leading the BBC to unilaterally ban repeats of it in its original form . All six series ( with the exception of the two banned episodes from Series Five ) have been released on DVD in the UK .

 Sir John Deed ( played by Martin Shaw ) is a recently appointed High Court judge who actively seeks justice in the cases before him , while at the same time trying to rekindle an old romance with former pupil Jo Mills QC , who regularly appears in his court . Deed is described by creator and writer G.F. Newman as a character who " speaks out against all the petty rules and bureaucracy that frustrates us all but that most of us don 't speak out against " . Because of Deed 's unorthodox actions , he is often hampered in his pursuit of justice by several more conventional @-@ minded characters , including his ex @-@ wife , barrister Georgina " George " Channing QC ( played by Caroline <unk> ) ; her father Appeals Court Judge , Lord Justice ( Sir Joseph ) Channing ( played by Sir Donald Sinden ) , fellow High Court Judges Mr Justice ( Sir Monty ) Everard ( played by Simon Ward ) and Mr Justice ( Sir Michael ) Niven ( played by Trevor Bowen ) , the Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor 's Department ( LCD , later Department of Constitutional Affairs ) Sir Ian Rochester ( played by Simon Chandler ) ; and later the Home Secretary Neil Haughton MP ( played by Nick Reding and later Aneirin Hughes ) . 
 Other recurring characters include Deed 's rebellious , animal rights activist daughter Charlie ( played by Louisa <unk> ) , who is initially a law student but later progresses to the courts ; Deed 's police friend , deputy assistant commissioner Row <unk> ( played by Christopher Cazenove ) ; and his clerk , Rita " Coop " Cooper ( played by Barbara Thorn ) , who is often on hand to temper some of his more radical ideas . Rita " Coop " was involved in many scenes of the show and was shown frequently in Judge John Deed advertisements . The first three series of the programme have a self @-@ contained structure , with a trial reaching its conclusion by the end of an episode . In later years , the series added a serialised format , with stories running over a number of episodes and a greater focus on the personal lives of characters other than Deed , with the main case concluding in each episode .

 Newman devised his new series to highlight what he believed to be an out @-@ of @-@ touch judiciary and show " solutions " ( a style that is different from , yet paradoxically similar to his previous work , such as his 1970s series Law and Order , which was heavily critical of the police , with Judge John Deed being heavily critical of the corrupt Establishment ) . Newman wrote the series intending to give the audience an exploration of the law without patronising them or getting caught up in an explanation of legal proceedings . A full series was commissioned before the pilot was broadcast . The series has been credited with renewing the " cop genre " by moving the story from a " maverick detective " to a high court judge , though as a comparison to Newman 's previous work , a Guardian writer called it " rather soft " and doubted , from seeing the pilot , whether it would provoke questions in the House of Commons like Law and Order did , while the show went on to provoke much hostility from many vested interests which it revealed to be corrupt or negligent . 
 Sets were constructed on the soundstages at Bushey , Hertfordshire for the courtroom , Deed 's chambers and the main characters ' houses . Exterior court scenes were filmed at the Crown Court in Aylesbury . Location filming was also done at West Herts College for scenes in " My Daughter , Right or Wrong " ( 2006 ) and at various locations , including The Hague City Hall , ( as film location for the International Criminal Court building in The Hague ) for " War Crimes " ( 2007 ) . The robes worn by Deed in the sixth series were authentic ones from Stanley Ley , a specialist legal outfitters , and cost £ 7 @,@ 600 . Theme music was composed for the series by Debbie Wiseman . The music , entitled " Judge John Deed " , was performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and is described as a " stunning march @-@ like theme that echoed throughout each of the programmes supplying pageantry to the Judge 's sometimes @-@ nefarious activities " . It was released commercially on Wiseman 's compilation album , Something Here , and as a single piece on online music retailers . From 2005 to 2007 , television promotions for the series have been accompanied by the piano hook from " <unk> " by Nina Simone . 
 29 episodes were produced ; the pilot , three series of four episodes , two series of six episodes and one series of two two @-@ part serials . All episodes were written and produced , and occasionally directed , by Newman . At the time the sixth series concluded , the future of the series was in doubt ; the BBC had announced an intention to use Martin Shaw in a range of new projects and it was apparent that the one @-@ off adaption of Alan Hunter 's Inspector Gently novels ( starring Shaw as the eponymous inspector ) would be commissioned for a full series . Jenny Seagrove clarified the situation , stating that the producers wanted to continue but she and Shaw were " taking a sabbatical " until the formula of the series was changed , implying that its future lay in the multi @-@ part format introduced in series six . In April 2009 , Shaw told BBC Breakfast that the series had been officially cancelled by the BBC because of financial cutbacks across the corporation . The six years the series was broadcast makes it the longest @-@ running BBC legal drama .

 Judge John Deed regularly formed the backbone of the BBC One winter schedule . The pilot and first series were broadcast on Tuesday evenings at 8 p.m. , with the second , third and fourth series moving to Thursday evenings ( 8 : 30 p.m. for the first two and 8 p.m. for the latter , though one episode in series three was postponed for over a month ) . The fifth series moved to Friday nights , and the sixth was shown two nights a week , with the first part of the story on Tuesday nights and concluding the following Thursday . This series was also the first to be simulcast on BBC HD . Occasionally , due to a clash with regional programming , it has aired at different times on BBC One Scotland ; series two was delayed for sometimes over a week while series three began a half @-@ hour earlier . Series five had a six @-@ day delay . 
 Ratings for the series peaked with its first episode at 9 @.@ 1 million but it continued to regularly draw in around 6 million viewers for later episodes . The series has been shown internationally by , amongst others , Canvas ( Belgium ) , BBC Canada and BBC Prime . In 2004 , Variety reported an American remake was set to be produced for NBC ; Michael <unk> was to produce the series , which would follow a federal court judge in Washington , D.C. who would preside over terrorism and civil rights cases . There have been no further developments since the announcement was made in 2004 .

 Judge John Deed presents a fictionalised version of the English legal system . The British Film Institute 's Screenonline notes that " Almost every week , Deed is seen presiding over cases being prosecuted by his ex @-@ wife or defended by his on @-@ off girlfriend ( with occasionally help from his daughter ) " , highlighting how unlikely it would be for a real judge to have so many conflicts of interest in his court . It also notes that Deed 's faults , such as his affairs with his therapist and with Francesca Rochester , prevent him from being " a completely idealised heroic figure " , and the fact that because all of his family and friends practise law , he is firmly entrenched in the legal system that he is constantly fighting against . Deed has been accused of hypocrisy , particularly for using his connections to bail Charlie after she destroyed GM crops in " <unk> Justice " . There is a belief in some legal circles that , although Judge John Deed is arguably the most unrealistic of contemporary legal dramas , viewers see Deed as an aspirational character taking on a corrupt establishment . Despite being picked apart by legal professionals , the cast and Newman were invited to the annual dinner of the Association of Women Barristers in 2006 as part of a drive to raise the profile and attract new members to the group . 
 The series ' creative interpretation of the law has led to a misconception by the public of what real law is like ( cf . CSI effect ) ; in the second <unk> Taylor trial , the presiding judge warned the jury that if they copied Deed 's actions in the then @-@ recent episode " One Angry Man " ( 2006 ) , in which Deed investigated a case and interviewed witnesses while sitting on a jury , they would " simply derail the whole process " .

 The 2006 series caused controversy for the misguided information presented in " Silent Killer " ( 2006 ) , which suggested a link between TETRA radio emissions and motor neurone disease . Statements were released by the TETRA Industry Group and the MND Association , the latter emphasising that while there is some evidence to suggest a link , it is not a single contributory factor . " Heart of Darkness " ( 2006 ) was criticised for portraying a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism , and the BBC received complaints on the matter . The Editorial Complaints Unit ruled that the episode had contravened the BBC 's " obligation of due impartiality on matters of public controversy " and that the episode would not be repeated in its original form . The episode was cited in From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel , an internal BBC report on impartiality in its output that was published in June 2007 , a section of which highlighted that the name of the <unk> character bore more than a passing resemblance to that of Dr Andrew Wakefield . 
 Television pundits have criticised the writing of the programme ; Robert Hanks of The Independent calls the scripts " often corny , even painfully so " , using Monty Everard 's line " You 'll come to regret crossing swords with me , sir ! " from " Health Hazard " ( 2003 ) as an example . Hanks also wrote about what he called " moral oversimplification " of the storylines ; the same episode featured " a wealthy and self @-@ important businessman — who had already been banned from talking on a mobile phone while driving — ran over and killed a mother and her two small children while talking on his mobile phone to his mistress , to whom he was explaining that he had to take his wife to a function at — the icing on this shabby cake — Downing Street . He then legged it and subsequently faked mental illness to avoid a trial ; a gambit that might have worked had Deed not cunningly threatened to send him to Broadmoor , at which point the man stood up and started protesting vociferously " . The series is frequently lampooned for its dialogue and unlikely scenarios . Andy Hamilton called the dialogue " the funniest on TV " and David Mitchell selected it as his " TV hell " in the series TV Heaven , Telly Hell . Deed 's " swashbuckling " persona has been satirised on the sketch series Dead Ringers . Despite the criticism given to the programme , the series is praised as being at its best when tackling topical issues , such as the MMR vaccine , human exposure to telephone masts and incestuous relationships . 
 The production style also rates highly ; writing in The Guardian , Mark Lawson called the pilot " glossier and more populist than Newman 's earlier work " . Wry reference is made to Deed and Jo 's relationship , with Lawson writing that Deed " is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC " . Writing on the programme 's accessibility to an audience , Nancy Banks @-@ Smith of The Guardian calls it " talkative in the way television plays used to be when they had something to say . But it is notable that , in a profession famous for obfuscation , Deed uses only the most pellucid English " . Banks @-@ Smith has also drawn attention to the masculine skew the programme has ; " Judge John Deed [ … ] is catnip to the ladies . These are <unk> called Georgie , Charlie , Jo and — when Rita defies abbreviation — Coop " .

 = Battle of Milne Bay = 
 The Battle of Milne Bay ( 25 August – 7 September 1942 ) , also known as Operation RE or the Battle of Rabi ( <unk> ) by the Japanese , was a battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II . Elite Japanese naval troops , known as Kaigun Tokubetsu Rikusentai ( Special Naval Landing Forces ) , with two small tanks attacked the Allied airfields at Milne Bay that had been established on the eastern tip of New Guinea . Due to poor intelligence work , the Japanese miscalculated the size of the predominantly Australian garrison and , believing that the airfields were only defended by two or three companies , initially landed a force roughly equivalent in size to one battalion on 25 August 1942 . The Allies , forewarned by intelligence from Ultra , had heavily reinforced the garrison . 
 Despite suffering a significant setback at the outset , when part of their small invasion force had its landing craft destroyed by Allied aircraft as they attempted to land on the coast behind the Australian defenders , the Japanese quickly pushed inland and began their advance towards the airfields . Heavy fighting followed as they encountered the Australian Militia troops that formed the first line of defence . These troops were steadily pushed back , but the Australians brought forward veteran Second Australian Imperial Force units that the Japanese had not expected . Allied air superiority helped tip the balance , providing close support to troops in combat and targeting Japanese logistics . Finding themselves heavily outnumbered , lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties , the Japanese withdrew their forces , with fighting coming to an end on 7 September 1942 . 
 The battle is considered to be the first major battle in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces . Although Japanese land forces had experienced local setbacks elsewhere in the Pacific earlier in the war , unlike at Milne Bay , these actions had not forced them to withdraw completely and abandon their strategic objective . Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air . As a result of the battle , Allied morale was boosted and Milne Bay was developed into a major Allied base , which was used to mount subsequent operations in the region . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Geography = = = 
 Milne Bay is a sheltered 97 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 250 km2 ) bay at the eastern tip of the Territory of Papua ( now part of Papua New Guinea ) . It is 22 miles ( 35 km ) long and 10 miles ( 16 km ) wide , and is deep enough for large ships to enter . The coastal area is flat with good aerial approaches , and therefore suitable for airstrips , although it is intercut by many tributaries of rivers and mangrove swamps . Owing to the swampy lands and high rainfall , about 200 inches ( 5 @,@ 100 mm ) per year , the area is prone to malaria and flooding . After floods , the coastal plains become " virtually impassable quagmires of glutinous mud " , and the ground is not suited for development . The bay is bounded to its north and south by the Stirling Ranges , which at points rise to 3 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 – 1 @,@ 520 m ) and are covered in Kunai grass and dense scrubland . The main area of firm ground suitable for construction and development is found directly at the head of the bay . In 1942 this area was occupied by plantations of palm oil , coconuts and cocoa , as well as a number of jetties and villages , connected by what was described by Major Sydney Elliott @-@ Smith of the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit ( ANGAU ) as a " modest ' road ' system " that was , in actuality , only a dirt track 10 – 12 metres ( 33 – 39 ft ) wide . The area was sparsely populated , although there were a number of villages along the track . <unk> was situated the farthest east , and together with Gili Gili in the west , it bounded <unk> , Waga Waga , <unk> , KB Mission , Rabi and Kilarbo .

 The Japanese thrust into the Pacific region had begun in early December 1941 with attacks against British and Commonwealth forces in the Battle of Hong Kong and the Malayan campaign , and against the US Pacific Fleet , much of which was caught at anchor in Pearl Harbor . They rapidly advanced south , overwhelming resistance in Malaya , capturing Singapore in February 1942 , and successfully occupying Timor , Rabaul and the Dutch East Indies . While a Japanese naval operation aimed at capturing Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May , elsewhere American forces in the Philippines capitulated , and Japanese forces advanced towards India through Burma . 
 Although the Japanese had been defeated in the Coral Sea , another attempt at capturing Port Moresby was anticipated . The Allied Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific Area , General Douglas MacArthur , decided to establish airbases to protect Port Moresby . To the west , he authorised the construction of an airbase at Merauke in Netherlands New Guinea . Another , codenamed " Boston " was authorised to the east in the largely unexplored Abau – Mullins Harbour area on 20 May . Any Japanese force approaching Port Moresby by sea would have to sail past these bases , allowing them to be detected and attacked earlier ; but the base in the east had other advantages too . Bombers flying missions to Rabaul and other Japanese bases to the north from there would not have to overfly the Owen Stanley Range , and would not be subject to the vagaries of the weather and air turbulence over the mountains . For that reason , an airstrip suitable for heavy bombers was desired so that they could stage there from Port Moresby and bases in northern Australia . 
 The Commander in Chief of Allied Land Forces , General Sir Thomas Blamey , selected a garrison for Boston on 24 May . The troops were informed that their mission was only to defend against Japanese raids , and in the event of a major attack they would destroy everything of value and withdraw . The Boston project fell through , as a reconnaissance of the area gave an unfavourable report and Elliott @-@ Smith suggested Milne Bay as a more suitable alternative site . A party of twelve Americans and Australians set out to explore Milne Bay in a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat on 8 June . They were impressed by the flat areas , the roads and the jetties , all of which would ease airbase construction . On receipt of a favourable report from the party , MacArthur 's General Headquarters ( GHQ ) cancelled Boston on 11 June and substituted Milne Bay . Milne Bay was given the codename " Fall River " . The use of place names as code names proved to be unwise , as some supplies were mistakenly sent to the real Fall River , in Massachusetts .

 The first troops arrived at Milne Bay from Port Moresby in the Dutch KPM ships <unk> and Bontekoe , escorted by the sloop HMAS Warrego and the corvette HMAS Ballarat on 25 June . <unk> docked at a pontoon wharf made from petrol drums hastily constructed by Papuan workers recruited by ANGAU , who assisted in unloading the ships . The troops included two and a half companies and a machine gun platoon from the 55th Infantry Battalion of the 14th Infantry Brigade , the 9th Light Anti @-@ Aircraft Battery with eight Bofors 40 mm guns , a platoon of the US 101st Coast Artillery Battalion ( Anti @-@ Aircraft ) with eight .5 inch machine guns , and two 3 @.@ 7 inch anti @-@ aircraft guns of the 23rd Heavy Anti @-@ Aircraft Battery . Company E of the 46th Engineers of the US Army Corps of Engineers arrived on Bontekoe with airbase construction equipment . Some 29 KPM ships had escaped to Australia after the fall of the Dutch East Indies . They were manned by Dutch and Javanese crews , and were the lifeline of the garrison at Milne Bay , making roughly two out of every three voyages there during the campaign , the remainder being by Australian , British and US ships . Five KPM ships would be lost during the fighting in Papua . 
 Work on the first airfield , which became known as No. 1 Airstrip , had commenced on 8 June , with Papuan workers under the supervision of ANGAU and US 96th Engineer Separate Battalion personnel clearing the area near Gili Gili . Company E of the 46th Engineers began working on it on 30 June . In addition to the runway , they had to build camouflaged dispersal areas for 32 fighters , taxiways and accommodation for 500 men . To support the airbase and the garrison , a platoon was diverted to working on the docks and roads . Although the channels in Milne Bay allowed deep draught ships to approach within 40 feet ( 12 m ) of the shore , they had to be unloaded onto pontoons and the stores manhandled onto vehicles , a labour @-@ intensive process . 
 Three Kittyhawks from No. 76 Squadron RAAF landed on the airstrip on 22 July , while additional aircraft from No. 76 and also No. 75 Squadron RAAF arrived on 25 July . They found that only 4 @,@ 950 by 80 feet ( 1 @,@ 509 by 24 m ) of the 6 @,@ 000 @-@ by @-@ 100 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 829 by 30 m ) runway was covered with Marsden Matting , and that water was frequently over it . Landing aircraft sprayed water about , and sometimes skidded off the runway and became bogged . 
 With No. 1 Airstrip operational , work began on two more airfields . Some 5 @,@ 000 coconut trees were removed for No. 2 Airstrip , and the site was levelled and graded , but its use first required the construction of at least two 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) bridges , so work moved to No. 3 Airstrip near Kilarbo . Its construction was undertaken by the 2nd Battalion of the US 43rd Engineers ( less Company E ) , which arrived on 4 August . That day Japanese aircraft began to bomb and strafe Milne Bay , focusing upon attacking the airfields and the engineers as they worked . Four Zeros and a dive bomber attacked No. 1 Airstrip . One Kittyhawk was destroyed on the ground , while a Kittyhawk from No. 76 Squadron shot down the dive bomber . Following this , the Australians established a workable radar system to provide early warning . On 11 August , 22 Kittyhawks intercepted 12 Zeroes . Despite their numerical advantage , the Australians lost three Kittyhawks , while claiming four Japanese Zeros shot down . 
 On 11 July , troops of the 7th Infantry Brigade , under the command of Brigadier John Field , began arriving to bolster the garrison . The brigade consisted of three Militia battalions from Queensland , the 9th , 25th and 61st Infantry Battalions . They brought with them guns of the 4th Battery of the 101st Anti @-@ Tank Regiment , the 2 / 6th Heavy Anti @-@ Aircraft Battery , and the 2 / 9th Light Anti @-@ Aircraft Battery , along with the first Australian engineer unit , the 24th Field Company . Field assumed command of " Milne Force " , a task force which exercised operational control over all Allied air , land and naval forces in the area , but only when an attack was imminent . He reported directly to Blamey 's Allied Land Forces in Brisbane rather than New Guinea Force in Port Moresby . His most urgent tasks were of an engineering nature . While the American engineers built the airstrips and wharves , the Australians worked on the roads and accommodation . The small force of sappers had to be augmented by infantry and Papuan labourers . 
 Although malaria was known to be endemic in the Milne Bay area , precautions taken against the disease were haphazard . Men wore shorts and kept their sleeves rolled up . Their mosquito repellent cream was ineffective , quinine was in short supply and many men arrived without their mosquito nets , which were stowed deep in the ships ' holds and took several days to unload . A daily dosage of 10 grains ( 0 @.@ 65 g ) was prescribed but Field 's troop were told not to take their quinine until they had been in the area a week . By this time , many had become infected with the disease . The Director of Medicine at Allied Land Forces Headquarters was Brigadier Neil Hamilton Fairley , an expert on tropical medicine . He visited Port Moresby in June , and was alarmed at the ineffectiveness of the measures being taken to combat the disease , which he realised was capable of destroying the entire Allied force in Papua . He made sure that the 110th Casualty Clearing Station left Brisbane for Milne Bay with a fully equipped pathological laboratory and a large quantity of anti @-@ malarial supplies , including 200 @,@ 000 quinine tablets . Unfortunately , some equipment was lost or ruined in transit , and the danger from malaria was not yet appreciated at Milne Bay . 
 The 55th Infantry Battalion 's companies were already badly afflicted by malaria and other tropical diseases , and were withdrawn and sent back to Port Moresby in early August , but the garrison was further reinforced with Second Australian Imperial Force troops of Brigadier George Wootten 's 18th Infantry Brigade of the 7th Division , which began arriving on 12 August , although it would not be complete until 21 August . This veteran brigade , which had fought in the Siege of Tobruk earlier in the war , consisted of the 2 / 9th , 2 / 10th and 2 / 12th Infantry Battalions . Anti @-@ aircraft and artillery support was provided by the 9th Battery of the 2 / 3rd Light Anti @-@ Aircraft Regiment , the US 709th Anti @-@ Aircraft Battery and the 9th Battery of the 2 / 5th Field Regiment , while various signals and logistics troops provided further support . 
 With two brigades now at Milne Bay , Major General Cyril Clowes was appointed to command Milne Force , which was placed under the control of New Guinea Force , now commanded by Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell , on 12 August . Clowes ' headquarters was formed in Sydney at the end of July and was flown up to Milne Bay . He arrived with some of his staff on 13 August , but had to wait until the rest arrived before he could formally assume command of Milne Force on 22 August . By this time there were 7 @,@ 459 Australian and 1 @,@ 365 US Army personnel at Milne Bay , of whom about 4 @,@ 500 were infantry . There were also about 600 RAAF personnel . 
 Clowes assigned the inexperienced 7th Infantry Brigade a defensive role , guarding key points around Milne Bay from seaborne or airborne attack , and kept the veteran 18th Infantry Brigade in reserve , ready to counterattack . Lacking accurate maps and finding that their signals equipment was unreliable in the conditions , the Australian command and control system consisted largely of cable telephones , or where there was not enough line available , runners . The soft ground made movement by road and even on foot difficult . 
 = = = Japanese = = = 
 Japanese aircraft soon discovered the Allied presence at Milne Bay , which was appreciated as a clear threat to Japanese plans for another seaborne advance on Port Moresby , starting with a landing at Samarai Island in the China Strait , not far from Milne Bay . On 31 July the commander of the Japanese XVII Army , Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake , requested that Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa 's 8th Fleet capture the new Allied base at Milne Bay instead . Mikawa therefore altered his plans for the Samarai operation , and substituted the capture of Milne Bay , which was codenamed Operation RE , and scheduled for the middle of August . Operation RE received a high priority after aircraft from the 25th Air Flotilla discovered the new Milne Bay airfields on 4 August , but was then postponed due to the American landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August . 
 Under the misconception that the airfields were defended by only two or three companies of Australian infantry ( 300 – 600 men ) , the initial Japanese assault force consisted of only about 1 @,@ 250 personnel . The Imperial Japanese Army was unwilling to conduct the operation as it feared that landing barges sent to the area would be attacked by Allied aircraft . Following an argument between Army and Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) officers , it was agreed that the Navy would have responsibility for the landing . As a result , the assault force was drawn from the Japanese naval infantry , known as Kaigun Rikusentai ( Special Naval Landing Forces ) . Some 612 naval troops from the 5th Kure Special Naval Landing Force ( SNLF ) , led by Commander Masajiro Hayashi , were scheduled to land on the east coast near a point identified by the Japanese as " Rabi " , along with 197 men from the 5th Sasebo SNLF , led by Lieutenant Fujikawa . It was planned that a further 350 personnel from the 10th Naval Landing Force , along with 100 men from the 2nd Air Advance Party , would land via barge on the northern coast of the peninsula at <unk> , in Goodenough Bay , from where it would strike out over the mountains of the Stirlings to attack the Australians from behind . Following the battle , the chief of staff of the Japanese Combined Fleet , Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki , assessed that the landing force was not of a high calibre as it contained many 30- to 35 @-@ year @-@ old soldiers who were not fully fit and had " inferior fighting spirit " . Naval support was to be provided by the 18th Cruiser Division under the command of Rear Admiral <unk> Matsuyama . The Japanese enjoyed some initial advantage in the form of possessing two Type @-@ 95 light tanks . After an initial attack , however , these tanks became marooned in the mud and abandoned . They also had control of the sea during the night , allowing reinforcement and evacuation . 
 = = = Allied intelligence advantage = = = 
 Countering these Japanese tactical advantages , the Allies enjoyed the strategic advantage of possessing superior intelligence about Japanese plans . The Japanese knew very little about Allied forces at Milne Bay , while the Allies received advance warning that the Japanese were planning an invasion . In mid @-@ July codebreakers under the command of Commander Eric Nave informed MacArthur that toward the end of August the Japanese planned to attack Milne Bay . They provided detailed information about the numbers of soldiers to expect , which units would be involved , their standard of training , and the names of the ships that the Japanese had allocated to the operation . MacArthur 's Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence , Brigadier General Charles A. Willoughby , had anticipated a Japanese reaction against Milne Force , and interpreted the Japanese reconnaissance on 4 August as foreshadowing an operation . After Allied Naval Forces Ultra decrypted a message that disclosed that a Japanese submarine picquet line had been established to cover the approaches to Milne Bay , Willoughby predicted that an attack was imminent . In response , MacArthur rushed the 18th Infantry Brigade to Milne Bay . Major General George Kenney , the commander of the Allied Air Forces , ordered air patrols stepped up over the likely Japanese invasion routes . He also ordered pre @-@ emptive air strikes against the Japanese airfields at Buna on 24 and 25 August , which reduced the number of Japanese fighters available to support the attack on Milne Bay to just six .

 Over the course of 23 and 24 August , aircraft from the 25th Air Flotilla carried out preparatory bombing around the airfield at Rabi . The main Japanese invasion force left Rabaul on 24 August , under Matsuyama 's command , at 7 : 00 am . The fleet was made up of two light cruisers , Tenryū and Tatsuta , as well as three destroyers , Urakaze , Tanikaze and Hamakaze , in concert with the transports , <unk> Maru and <unk> Maru , and the submarine chasers CH @-@ 22 and CH @-@ 24 . 
 At 8 : 30 am on 24 August , Milne Bay GHQ was alerted by an RAAF Hudson bomber near <unk> Island , off the Trobriand Islands , and coastwatchers that a Japanese convoy was approaching the Milne Bay area . HMAS Arunta – escorting the transport SS Tasman – left the Milne Bay area and sailed for Port Moresby after learning of the invasion force . Reports of the second Japanese convoy , consisting of seven barges , which had sailed from Buna carrying the force that would land at <unk> were also received at this time . In response to this sighting , after the initially poor weather had cleared , 12 RAAF Kittyhawks were scrambled at midday . The barges were spotted beached near Goodenough Island where the 350 troops of the 5th Sasebo SNLF , led by Commander <unk> , had gone ashore to rest . The Australian pilots then proceeded to strafe the barges and , over the course of two hours , destroyed them all and stranded their former occupants . 
 After the initial sighting , the main invasion force , consisting of the heavy naval screening force and the two transports , remained elusive until the morning of 25 August . In an effort to intercept it , US B @-@ 17s operating from bases at Mareeba and Charters Towers in Queensland , were dispatched , although they were unable to complete their mission as bad weather closed in . Later in the afternoon , a number of Kittyhawks and a single Hudson bomber strafed the convoy and attempted to bomb the transports with 250 lb ( 110 kg ) bombs near Rabi Island . Only limited damage was caused to the convoy and no ships were sunk . After this , due to the withdrawal of the only Allied naval presence in the area – Arunta and Tasman – an RAAF tender was sent to act as a picket in the bay , ready to provide early warning of the approaching Japanese . 
 Meanwhile , earlier in the day , Clowes decided to shorten his lines and passed the order for D Company , 61st Infantry Battalion , which had been sent to <unk> in the east , to withdraw back behind ' B ' Company at KB Mission and reposition itself at the No. 3 Airstrip at Gili Gili . A shortage of water craft , however , delayed D Company 's departure until the evening of 25 / 26 August after requisitioning three luggers <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . At around 10 : 30 pm , the Japanese main force , consisting of over 1 @,@ 000 men and two Type 95 Ha @-@ Go tanks , had made landfall near Waga Waga , on the northern shore of the bay ; due to an error in navigation they came ashore about 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) east of where they had intended , placing them further away from their objective . Nevertheless , they quickly sent out patrols to secure the area , rounding up local villagers , and established a beachhead . 
 Later that evening , two of the small water craft that D Company were using to withdraw to Gili Gili encountered the Japanese landing force . In the firefight that followed , one of the craft – <unk> – was forced to beach and its occupants forced to return to take to the jungle on foot , eventually reaching Gili Gili some time later ; the other , <unk> , was holed and of its passengers , 11 were killed either in the engagement or by the Japanese following their capture .

 By dawn of 26 August , advancing west along the coast with armoured support , the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company , 61st Infantry Battalion , around KB Mission . The Japanese force moved through the jungle at the edge of the coastal track , and was headed by two light tanks . Although they lacked anti @-@ armour weapons , the Australians were able to turn back the Japanese attack . At this stage , the Japanese suffered a serious setback when their base area was heavily attacked at daylight by RAAF Kittyhawks and a Hudson aircraft , along with B @-@ 25s , B @-@ 26s and B @-@ 17s from the US Fifth Air Force . As a result of the attack , a number of Japanese troops were killed , while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed and a number of landing barges were beached near the KB Mission . Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system , the destruction of the landing barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions . The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced to turn back due to bad weather . 
 Nevertheless , the Japanese were still pressing on the 61st Infantry Battalion 's positions throughout the day . Field , who had command responsibility for the local area , decided to send two platoons from the 25th Infantry Battalion to provide support . Later , the remaining two rifles companies from the 61st were also dispatched , along with their mortar platoon . The muddy track meant that the Australians were unable to move anti @-@ tank guns into position ; however , as a stop @-@ gap measure quantities of sticky bombs and anti @-@ tank mines were moved up to the forward units . At 4 : 45 pm , with air and artillery support , the Australians launched a minor attack upon the Japanese forward positions which were located about 600 yards ( 550 m ) to the east of the mission , pushing the Japanese back a further 200 yards ( 180 m ) . Weary from the day 's fighting , though , they withdrew to <unk> , west of the mission . 
 The Australians then attempted to break contact and withdraw towards a creek line where they hoped to establish a defensive line as darkness came . The Japanese stayed in close contact with the Australians , harassing their rear elements . The men from B Company then sought to establish their position , while the 2 / 10th Infantry Battalion made preparations to move eastwards towards <unk> , passing through the lines of the 25th and 61st Infantry Battalions . In the early evening , Japanese ships shelled the Australian positions and later , at 10 : 00 pm , the Japanese launched a heavy attack on the Australians which continued sporadically through the night . By 4 : 00 am the following morning , the Japanese began to employ infiltration and deception techniques to try to outflank the Australian positions . Anticipating an armoured attack at dawn , the Australians withdrew back to the Gama River , which was situated 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the west . During the night , the destroyer Hamakaze entered the bay to make contact with the Japanese troops and land supplies . The landing force had been out of radio contact since 2 : 00 pm , and the destroyer was unable to raise it with either her radio or visual signalling devices . As a result , Hamakaze departed Milne Bay at 2 : 30 am without having landed any supplies . 
 Shortly after dawn , in the air , a Japanese force consisting of eight dive bombers with 12 Zero fighter escorts attacked the Allied airfield at Gili Gili . One of the attacking aircraft was shot down , while only a small amount of damage was inflicted . Meanwhile , around the mission as the Japanese reconnoitred Australian positions , the 2 / 10th Infantry Battalion , consisting of just 420 men , was ordered to the Gama River by Clowes . This operation was badly planned and did not have a clear purpose ; it was launched as both a reconnaissance in force and a counter @-@ attack , but evolved into an attempt to establish a blocking force at KB Mission . Moreover , while the Australians had no knowledge of the strength or intentions of the Japanese , no force would be able to reinforce the battalion once it moved outside the main defensive lines near the airstrips . The 2 / 10th 's forward patrols made contact with the 61st Infantry Battalion at around 10 : 30 am on 27 August and , upon arrival at around 5 : 00 pm , they began to establish their position ; with only limited entrenching tools , they found the going difficult . At this point , the troops from the 25th and 61st Battalion were ordered to pull back , having lost 18 men killed and a further 18 wounded , along with an unknown number missing in action . 
 At 8 : 00 pm the Japanese sent two Type 95 tanks with bright headlights into the plantation . The men from the 2 / 10th tried to disable them with sticky bombs , but due to the humid conditions the bombs failed to adhere to the Japanese armour . In the fighting that followed over the course of two and a half hours , the Australians suffered heavy casualties . Receiving indirect fire support from the 2 / 5th Field Regiment 's 25 pounder guns situated near Gili Gili , they repelled four frontal attacks . However , by midnight the Japanese were inside the Australian position and in the confusion the 2 / 10th withdrew in some disorder to a number of scattered positions on the west bank of the Gama , which they reached by about 2 : 00 am on 28 August . A further assault , however , by tank @-@ mounted infantry forced them back further , moving back through the 61st and 25th Infantry Battalions towards No. 3 Airstrip , which was still under construction , south of Kilarbo . During the brief engagement around KB Mission , they had lost 43 men killed and another 26 wounded . 
 As the 2 / 10th withdrew , the 25th Infantry Battalion , which had moved forward from Gili Gili to relieve the 61st , deployed around the airstrip and at Rabi , <unk> Creek and Kilarbo , laying mines in key locations . The airstrip proved a perfect defensive location , offering a wide , clear field of fire , while at its end , thick mud served to prevent the movement of Japanese tanks . Around dawn the advancing Japanese troops reached the airstrip and , under the cover of field artillery and mortars , they launched an attack . Although the Australians did not know it , the tanks that were supporting the attack became stuck in the mud and were subsequently abandoned ; they would later be discovered by an Australian patrol on 29 August . Meanwhile , troops from the 25th and 61st Infantry Battalions , along with Americans from the 709th Anti @-@ Aircraft Battery turned back the attacking Japanese infantry . Further strafing by Kittyhawks followed , and the Japanese were forced to fall back 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) to the east of Rabi . 
 Following this , for the next two days there was a lull in the fighting . During this time , the Australians consolidated their defences . The 61st Infantry Battalion , despite being seriously depleted from the previous fighting , were ordered back to the perimeter around the airstrip , subsequently deploying around Stephen 's Ridge , tying in with the 25th Battalion 's positions between the coast and <unk> Creek . Fire support was provided by mortars from the 25th along with Vickers machine guns from the 61st and .30 and .50 calibre machine guns mounted on the American half @-@ tracks . The American engineers and anti @-@ aircraft gunners became the first American troops to engage in ground combat in New Guinea . 
 Elsewhere , the 2 / 12th Infantry Battalion began moving forward from <unk> to enable it to join the fighting later as a counterattacking force . They , along with the 2 / 9th , were subsequently tasked to carry out an attack from No. 3 Airstrip to KB Mission . Meanwhile , the Japanese also sought to reconfigure their forces and Mikawa decided to reinforce the forces that were already ashore . These reinforcements , consisting of 567 men from the 3rd Kure SNLF and 200 from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF , left Rabaul on 28 August . At around 4 : 30 pm an RAAF patrol spotted the Japanese convoy – consisting of one cruiser and nine destroyers – and subsequently reported this to the Allied headquarters . Believing that further landings were about to occur , Clowes cancelled his plans to begin a counterattack with the troops from the 18th Brigade . Orders were also passed for the 30 Kittyhawks at Gili Gili to be flown off to Port Moresby in case the Japanese succeeded in breaking through to the airfield . The attack did not take place , though , and consequently early in the morning on 29 August they returned , albeit minus two aircraft which had crashed during the move . 
 The Japanese convoy arrived off Waga Waga at 8 : 15 pm on 29 August , and began landing troops and supplies . While this was taking place the warships shelled Allied positions around Gili Gili and by 11 : 30 pm , had completed their landing . The shelling was not significant , however , and no casualties resulted from it . Throughout 30 August , the Australians carried out patrolling operations while the Japanese laid up in the jungle in preparation for an attack that night . 
 Later that night the Japanese began forming up along the track at the eastern end of No. 3 Airstrip by the sea , and at 3 : 00 am on 31 August they launched their attack . Advancing over open ground and illuminated by flares fired by the Australians , the first Japanese attack was repelled by heavy machine gun and mortar fire from 25th and 61st Infantry Battalions as well as the 46th Engineer General Service Regiment , and artillery fire from the Australian 2 / 5th Field Regiment . A further two banzai charges were attempted only to meet the same fate , with heavy Japanese casualties , including the Japanese commander , Hayashi . At this point , Commander Minoru Yano , who had arrived with the Japanese reinforcements on 29 August , took over from Hayashi , and after the survivors of the attack had reformed in the dead ground around <unk> Creek , he led them about 200 yards ( 180 m ) north of the airstrip in an attempt to outflank the 61st Infantry Battalion 's positions on Stephen 's Ridge . After running into a platoon of Australians who engaged them with Bren light machine guns , the Japanese withdrew just before dawn to the sounds of a bugle call . The Japanese troops who survived this attack were shocked by the heavy firepower the Allied forces had been able to deploy , and the assault force was left in a state of disarray . 
 = = = Australian counterattack = = = 
 Early on 31 August , the 2 / 12th Infantry Battalion began moving towards KB Mission , with ' D ' Company leading the way and struggling through muddy conditions along the track , which had been turned into a quagmire due to the heavy rain and equally heavy traffic . After passing through the 61st Infantry Battalion 's position , at around 9 : 00 am they began their counterattack along the north coast of Milne Bay . As the Australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties . They also encountered several Japanese soldiers who tried to lure the Australians in close for attack by pretending to be dead . In response , some Australians systematically bayoneted and shot the bodies of Japanese soldiers . At noon , the 9th Infantry Battalion , a Militia unit from the 7th Infantry Brigade , dispatched two companies to occupy some of the ground that the 2 / 12th had regained around No. 3 Airstrip and the mission . 
 Making slow going amidst considerable resistance , the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission late in the day . A force of Japanese remained there , and the Australians attacked with bayonets fixed . In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded . The Australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission . Meanwhile , the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2 / 12th to continue its advance the following morning . 
 That night , a force of around 300 Japanese who had been falling back since they had run into the 61st Infantry Battalion on Stephen 's Ridge , encountered positions manned by the 2 / 12th and 9th Infantry Battalions around the Gama River . In a surprise attack , the Australians inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese . After the battle the Australians estimated that up to 90 had been killed . Following this the Japanese began to employ infiltration techniques in an attempt to pass through the numerous listening posts that had been set up along the side of the track which formed the front of one side of the 2 / 12th 's position . Elsewhere , at the mission , starting at around 8 : 00 pm , they carried out harassment operations in an effort to distract the Australians and assist their comrades to try to break through the Australian positions from the Gama River . This lasted throughout the night . 
 The following morning , 1 September , the 2 / 12th Infantry Battalion went on the offensive again , while a force of seven Kittyhawks attacked the Japanese headquarters around Waga Waga . By this time , the Japanese had abandoned the objective of reaching the airfields and instead sought only to hold off the Australians long enough to be evacuated . This information was not known by the Allies , however , who were in fact expecting the Japanese to undertake further offensive action . In this regard , the 2 / 9th , initially with orders to join the 2 / 12th 's counterattack , was delayed an extra day after an erroneous intelligence report from MacArthur 's headquarters warning Clowes of a renewed Japanese attack forced him to briefly adopt a more defensive posture . The attack did not occur and , as a result , on 2 September the 2 / 9th was moved by barge up to the KB Mission . The next day it took over from the 2 / 12th and led the Australian advance . With the Japanese position at Milne Bay close to collapse , on 2 September Yano sent a radio message to the headquarters of the 8th Fleet which stated : " [ w ] e have reached the worst possible situation . We will together calmly defend our position to the death . We pray for absolute victory for the empire and for long @-@ lasting fortune in battle for you all " . 
 The terrain in this part of the bay offered significant advantage to defending forces , lined as it was with numerous creeks which slowed movement and obscured firing lanes . Throughout 3 September , the 2 / 9th Infantry Battalion came up against significant resistance ; in one engagement that took place around mid @-@ morning along a stream to the west of <unk> Creek they lost 34 men killed or wounded as they attempted to force their way across a creek . Engaged with sustained machine gun fire , the two assault platoons withdrew back across the creek while elements of another company that was in support moved to the northern flank . Launching their assault , they found that the Japanese had withdrawn , leaving about 20 of their dead . 
 Following this , the 2 / 9th advanced a further 500 yards ( 460 m ) , reaching Sanderson 's Bay , before deciding to set up their night location . That night Japanese ships again shelled Australian positions on the north shore of the bay , but without causing any casualties among the defenders . 
 On 4 September , the Australian advance continued as the 2 / 9th moved up the coast either side of the coastal track . After about one hour , the advance company struck a Japanese defensive position at <unk> . Throughout the day the Australians worked to outflank the position before launching an attack at 3 : 15 pm . During this action , one of the 2 / 9th 's sections was held up by fire from three Japanese machine gun positions . Corporal John French ordered the other members of the section to take cover before he attacked and destroyed two of the machine guns with grenades . French then attacked the third position with his Thompson submachine gun . The Japanese firing ceased and the Australian section advanced to find that the machine gunners had been killed and that French had died in front of the third position . He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his " cool courage and disregard of his own personal safety " which " saved members of his section from heavy casualties and was responsible for the successful conclusion of the attack " . By the end of the 4th , the Japanese force included only 50 fully fit soldiers ; all the other surviving troops were either incapacitated or could only offer token resistance . In addition , the commanders of all the Japanese companies had been killed and only three or four platoon leaders remained . 
 = = = Japanese withdrawal = = = 
 Following the fighting on 31 August , the Japanese forces ashore had reported the situation to their headquarters at Rabaul . In response , plans were made to send the Aoba Detachment , which comprised the Army 's 4th Infantry Regiment and an artillery company , to Rabi to complete the capture of the airfield . However , they were not scheduled to arrive until 11 September and so it was planned in the meantime to reinforce Yano 's men with 130 men from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF . An abortive attempt was made to land these troops on 2 September and then again on 4 September . By that time , however , as further reports were received by the Japanese headquarters , it became apparent that Yano 's troops would not be able to hold out until the Aoba Detachment could arrive . As a result , on 5 September , the Japanese high command ordered a withdrawal . This was carried out from the sea that evening . 
 Meanwhile , six Beauforts of No. 100 Squadron RAAF had arrived at Milne Bay on 5 September . An additional three Beaufighters of No. 30 Squadron RAAF , the first to operate this aircraft , joined them the following day . The Beauforts were tasked with providing additional support against further landings and undertaking anti @-@ shipping missions . On 6 September , the Allied offensive reached the main camp of the Japanese landing force , fighting a number of minor actions against small groups that had been left behind after the evacuation . 
 Shortly after ten on the evening of 6 September , as the freighter <unk> was continuing unloading cargo under her lights , the port came under fire from the Japanese cruiser Tenryū and the destroyer Arashi with <unk> receiving about ten hits from the cruiser and rolling onto her side . The Japanese ships also shelled shore positions at Gili Gili and Waga Waga and illuminated , but did not fire on , the hospital ship Manunda which was displaying her hospital ship colours and lights . The next night , two Japanese warships – a cruiser and a destroyer – bombarded Australian positions causing a number of casualties for 15 minutes before leaving the bay ; it would be their final act in the battle . During the mopping up operations that followed , patrols by Australian troops tracked down and killed a number of Japanese troops who were attempting to trek overland to Buna . 
 The 350 Japanese troops who had been stranded on Goodenough Island after their barges were destroyed on 24 August were not rescued until late October . An attempt to evacuate the force on 11 September ended in failure when the two destroyers assigned to this mission were attacked by USAAF aircraft , resulting in the loss of Yayoi . Two further attempts to rescue the force on 13 and 22 September were unsuccessful , though supplies were air @-@ dropped on Goodenough Island . A submarine landed further supplies and evacuated 50 sick personnel on 3 and 13 October . As part of the preparations for the attack on Buna and Gona , the 2 / 12th Infantry Battalion was assigned responsibility for securing Goodenough Island on 19 October . The battalion landed on the island three days later . A series of small engagements on 23 and 24 October cost the Australian force 13 killed and 19 wounded , and the Japanese suffered 20 killed and 15 wounded . The remaining Japanese troops were evacuated by two barges to nearby Fergusson Island on the night of 24 October , and the light cruiser Tenryū rescued them two days later . After securing the island , the 2 / 12th began work on building Vivigani Airfield on its east coast . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Base development = = = 
 The Allies continued to develop the base area at Milne Bay in support of the counter @-@ offensive along the northern coast of Papua and New Guinea . The American base became US Advanced Sub Base A on 21 April 1943 , US Advance Base A on 14 August and US Base A on 15 November . Its Australian counterpart , the Milne Bay Base Sub Area , was formed on 14 June 1943 . Two 155 @-@ millimetre ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) coastal guns with searchlights were provided to protect the base from naval threats . New roads were built and the existing ones upgraded to make them passable in the wet conditions . A meteorological record was set on 29 April 1944 , when 24 inches ( 610 mm ) of rain fell in a 24 @-@ hour period . By June 1944 , there was over 100 miles ( 160 km ) of road in the area . 
 A bitumen @-@ surfaced second runway was built at No. 1 Airstrip by No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF , after which the original runway was only used for emergencies and taxiing . The minefield around No. 3 Airstrip was lifted and the airstrip was completed , with revetments and <unk> for 70 medium bombers . A new wharf , known as Liles ' wharf after the American engineer who supervised its construction , was built in September and October 1942 . This was capable of handling Liberty ships . Henceforth ships could sail direct to Milne Bay from the United States , reducing the pressure on Australian ports and saving two or three days ' sailing time plus the time taken to unload and then reload the cargo on smaller ships . PT boats were based at Milne Bay from December 1942 , and a transhipment and staging area , overhaul facilities for PT boats , a destroyer base and Station Hospital were also constructed . Milne Bay was used as a staging area for mounting the landing at Lae in September 1943 , and the New Britain Campaign in December . The base at Milne Bay remained operational until the end of the war . 
 = = = War crimes = = = 
 During the Australian counterattack , the advancing troops found evidence that the Japanese had committed a number of war crimes at Milne Bay , specifically the execution of prisoners of war ( POWs ) and civilians . None of the 36 Australian troops who were captured by the Japanese survived ; a number of them were found to have been executed with some showing signs of having been mutilated as well . In addition , at least 59 civilians were also murdered between 25 August and 6 September ; included in this were a number of Papuan women who were sexually assaulted before being killed . The war crimes committed at Milne Bay hardened Australian soldiers ' attitudes towards Japanese troops for the remainder of the war . Historian Mark Johnston has written that " the Australians ' relentless killing of Japanese then and thereafter owed much to a determination both to retaliate in kind and to take revenge for Japanese atrocities and rumoured maltreatment of POWs " . 
 Later , the Australian Minister for External Affairs , Dr. H. V. Evatt , commissioned a report by William Webb on war crimes committed by the Japanese . Webb took depositions about the Milne Bay incident from members of the Allied forces who had been present , and used them to form part of his report . In 1944 this was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission , which had been set up by the Allies following the Moscow Declaration . Evidence about the crimes was presented to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal on 2 January 1947 , but no Japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during the fighting at Milne Bay . 
 = = = Results = = = 
 The Australians estimated Japanese casualties to be around 700 to 750 killed in action , and a Japanese source reported 625 killed in action . Of the 1 @,@ 943 Japanese soldiers that were landed at Milne Bay , ships from the Japanese 18th Cruiser Division managed to evacuate 1 @,@ 318 personnel , including 311 who were wounded . The Australians suffered 373 casualties , of which 167 were killed or missing in action . US forces lost 14 personnel killed and several wounded . 
 Although Allied casualties during the battle had been light , in the wake of the battle , Milne Bay suffered an epidemic of malaria that posed a threat to the base as great as that from the Japanese attack . Over one @-@ sixth of Milne Force , including Clowes , came down with the disease . The incidence of malaria soared to 33 per thousand per week in September ( equivalent to 1 @,@ 716 per thousand per annum ) , and to 82 per thousand per week in December ( equivalent to 4 @,@ 294 per thousand per annum ) . At this rate , the whole force could have been incapacitated in a matter of months . It placed enormous strain on the medical units and the supplies of anti @-@ malarial drugs . The Chief Pathologist of New Guinea Force , Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford went to see Blamey , who was now in personal command of New Guinea Force , and told him that 1 @,@ 000 men and a large quantity of anti @-@ malarial supplies were urgently required at Milne Bay to avert a disaster . Blamey took a personal interest in the matter . He expedited supply shipments , and made the required personnel available . The arrival of quantities of the new drug atebrin allowed this more effective drug to be substituted for quinine . The incidence of malaria dropped dramatically after December , the month in which atebrin became the official Australian prophylactic drug , and by March 1943 the crisis had passed . After this , the incidence of malaria amongst the garrison at Milne Bay was similar to other bases in Papua and New Guinea . 
 Strategically , as a result of the fighting around Milne Bay , Japanese operations within the region were constrained . The defeat at Milne Bay kept them from bypassing the holding action that the Australians were conducting on the Kokoda Track . Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air . The Japanese commanders were then forced to change their plans in the region , shifting their focus towards repelling the US forces that had landed on Guadalcanal , while maintaining a smaller effort around Buna – Gona , under Major General Tomitarō Horii . Once they had retaken Guadalcanal , they planned to reinforce Horii 's forces and launch a reinvigorated attack on the Australians around Port Moresby . In the end , subsequent defeats at Buna – Gona and on Guadalcanal did not allow them to implement these plans , as the Allies gained the ascendency in the region throughout late 1942 and the Japanese were forced to fall back to the northern coast of New Guinea . In the aftermath of the battle , a large amount of intelligence was also gained by the Allies , providing their planners with a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese and their equipment . It also demonstrated that the Militia were an effective fighting force . 
 The most significant result , though , was the effect that the victory had on the morale of Allied servicemen elsewhere in Asia and the Pacific , especially those on the Kokoda Track , and British troops fighting in Burma . Although the Japanese had previously suffered minor local defeats , such as the first landing at Wake Island and the Battle of the Tenaru on Guadalcanal , these actions , unlike Milne Bay , had not resulted in complete Japanese withdrawal and the abandonment of the military campaign . The Allied victory at Milne Bay therefore represented the first " full @-@ scale defeat [ of the Japanese ] on land " . 
 In Australia , initial public reaction to the victory at the time was one of cautious optimism . An article in The Canberra Times from early September 1942 labelled the victory a " tonic surprise " , and while highlighting the example as a portent of future battlefield success by Australian forces in the region , also pointed out the task that lay ahead of the Australians in New Guinea remained a " major problem " . Most significantly , though , it highlighted the importance of morale in turning the tide in the war , describing it as " the bridge that must carry all the vast and complicated effort being directed towards victory " . Another article , which appeared in The West Australian at the same time , while also preparing the Australian public for the tough fighting that would follow in New Guinea , hailed the victory at Milne Bay as a " turning point " , the instance of which signalled an end of a " rearguard campaign " and the start of an Allied offensive in the region . 
 Amongst individual Australian soldiers , the news of the victory helped to dispel some of the notions about the invincibility of the Japanese soldier that had developed in the psyche of Allied soldiers following the defeats of early 1942 , and which had impacted on Allied planning up to that point . Some of these notions would remain until the end of the war , but the news of Milne Bay allowed some soldiers to rationalise the Japanese soldiers ' past victories as being the result of tangible factors , such as numerical superiority , that could be overcome , rather than innate factors associated with the intangible qualities of the Japanese soldier that were not so easily overcome . After this , amongst the Allies there was " a sense that fortune 's wheel was turning " , and although leaders such as Blamey emphasised the difficulties that lay ahead , a feeling of confidence in eventual victory emerged . MacArthur warned the War Department that success was attributable to good intelligence that allowed him to concentrate a superior force at Milne Bay , and might not be repeatable . 
 After the war , the Australian Army commemorated the battle through the awarding of a battle honour titled " Milne Bay " to a number of the units that took part . The units chosen were the 9th , 25th , 61st , 2 / 9th , 2 / 10th and 2 / 12th Infantry Battalions . The two RAAF fighter squadrons that had taken part in the fighting were also singled out for praise by the Australian commanders for their role in the battle . Rowell stated : " the action of 75 and 76 Squadrons RAAF on the first day was probably the decisive factor " , a view Clowes endorsed in his own report .

 The Cormier wrestling family is a group of Canadian brothers who competed in professional wrestling . They were born in New Brunswick and wrestled primarily in Canada . They also competed in the United States and had stints in several other countries . On many occasions , the <unk> wrestled together as tag team partners . Two of the brothers were also involved in promoting wrestling . The family has been honored by the Cauliflower Alley Club , a social organization composed of people in the wrestling business , for their contributions to the sport . Jean @-@ Louis died in 2008 , and Yvon died in 2009 ; Leonce and Romeo still wrestle occasionally . 
 = = Family = = 
 The Cormier brothers were the sons of Edmond Cormier and Bernadette Doucette . They grew up on a farm in what is now Memramcook , New Brunswick . Four of the brothers had long careers as professional wrestlers , while a fifth , Malcolm Cormier , competed briefly before becoming a referee . None of the brothers wrestled under the family surname , however , as they all adopted ring names . One of the brothers explained that the brothers ' real names were too hard to pronounce , so they adopted other names that were easier for international fans . Yvon Cormier was given the name The Beast , Jean @-@ Louis was known as Rudy Kay , Leonce took the name Leo Burke , and Romeo competed as Bobby Kay . Malcolm , the oldest of the brothers involved in wrestling , used the name Mel <unk> while working as a referee . 
 The brothers often competed together in various promotions ; in the Eastern Sports Association ( ESA ) , which Jean @-@ Louis ( Rudy ) owned , they scripted the feuds so that the four brothers often faced a common opponent . A heel ( villain ) wrestler would face Rudy and emerge victorious from a series of matches ; they would then do the same with Bobby and then Leo before facing The Beast . They also held numerous tag team titles together .

 Yvon Cormier , competing mainly as The Beast , made his professional wrestling debut in 1963 . He has been described as " probably the most @-@ travelled " of the brothers , but most of his title victories came in the Maritimes . He held the ESA International Tag Team Championship eight times , including at least one reign with each of his three brothers . He also competed internationally , including stints in the United States , Japan , and Australia . He was known for his strength and demonstrations of his power . During his career , he wrestled against seven world champions . Yvon Cormier died of bone marrow cancer on March 4 , 2009 .

 Jean @-@ Louis Cormier , who was given the ring name Rudy Kay because he resembled a retired wrestler who had used the same name , spent much of his career balancing his roles as promoter and wrestler . He helped found the ESA in 1969 and operated shows under the title International Wrestling ( IW ) . He won five tag team championships while teaming with The Beast and held two titles as a singles wrestler . He retired from active competition in 1982 and died of septicemia on May 25 , 2008 .

 = Peter , King of Hungary = 
 Peter Orseolo , or Peter the Venetian ( Hungarian : <unk> Péter ; 1010 or 1011 – 1046 , or late 1050s ) , was King of Hungary twice . He first succeeded his uncle , King Stephen I , in 1038 . His favoritism towards his foreign courtiers caused an uprising which ended with his 1041 deposition . Peter was restored in 1044 by Henry III , Holy Roman Emperor . He accepted the Emperor 's suzerainty during his second reign , which ended in 1046 after a pagan uprising . Hungarian chronicles are unanimous that Peter was executed by order of his successor , Andrew I , but the chronicler Cosmas of Prague 's reference to his alleged marriage around 1055 suggests that he may also have survived his second deposition .

 = = = Before 1038 = = = 
 Peter was born in Venice , the only son of Doge Otto Orseolo . His mother was a sister of Stephen I , the first king of Hungary ; historian Gyula Kristó suggests that he was born in 1010 or 1011 . The Venetians rose up and deposed Otto Orseolo in 1026 . Peter did not follow his father , who fled to the Byzantine court in Constantinople ; he instead went to Hungary , where his uncle appointed him commander of the royal army . 
 Emeric , Stephen 's only son to survive infancy , died in an accident in 1031 . Stephen 's cousin Vazul had the strongest claim to the throne , but the King overlooked him and named Peter as his heir . On Stephen 's order , Vazul was blinded shortly thereafter and his three sons – Levente , Andrew and Béla – exiled , which strengthened Peter 's right of succession . The King asked Peter to take an oath respecting the property of his wife , Queen Giselle , suggesting that Peter 's relationship with his aunt was tense . 
 = = = First rule ( 1038 – 1041 ) = = = 
 Peter succeeded King Stephen I , who died on 15 August 1038 , and adopted an active foreign policy . Hungarian troops plundered Bavaria in 1039 and 1040 , and invaded Bohemia in 1040 to assist Duke <unk> I against Holy Roman Emperor Henry III . Hungarian chronicles recount that Peter preferred the company of Germans ( " who roared like wild beasts " ) and Italians ( " who chattered and <unk> like swallows " ) , which made him unpopular among his subjects . He introduced new taxes , seized Church revenue and deposed two bishops . 
 <unk> , Peter confiscated Queen Giselle 's property and took her into custody . She sought help from Hungarian lords , who blamed one of Peter 's favorites ( Budo ) for the monarch 's misdeeds and demanded that Budo be put on trial . When the King refused , the lords seized and murdered his unpopular advisor and deposed the monarch in 1041 . They elected a new king , Samuel Aba , who was a brother @-@ in @-@ law or another nephew of King Stephen I. 
 As soon as he began to rule , Peter threw aside every trace of the forbearance befitting a monarch 's majesty , and in consort with Germans and Latins raged with Teutonic fury , treating the nobles of the kingdom with contempt and devouring the wealth of the land " with a proud eye and an insatiable heart . " Fortifications , castles , and every office in the kingdom was taken away from the Hungarians and given to Germans or Latins . In addition , Peter was extremely debauched , and his hangers @-@ on behaved with shameful and unbridled lust , violently assaulting the wives and daughters of the Hungarians wherever the king travelled . No one at the time could feel sure of the chastity of his wife or daughter in the face of the importunity of Peter 's courtiers . 
 = = = Exile ( 1041 – 1044 ) = = = 
 Peter first fled to Austria , seeking the protection of his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Margrave Adalbert . He approached Emperor Henry III for help against Samuel Aba . The new Hungarian monarch invaded Austria in February 1042 , but Adalbert routed Aba 's troops . Henry III launched his first expedition against Hungary in early 1042 . His forces advanced north of the Danube to the river Garam ( Hron , Slovakia ) . The Emperor planned to restore Peter , but the locals were strongly opposed . Accordingly , the Emperor appointed another ( unnamed ) member of the Hungarian royal family to administer the territories . 
 In the autumn King Henry also invaded Hungary , destroyed Hainburg and Pressburg and either laid waste or received the surrender of the northern region of the Danube as far as the River Gran , because rivers and marshes protected the southern region . Part of the army twice encountered attacking Hungarians and wrought great slaughter . After the subjection of the Hungarians of that territory , since they refused to accept Peter , he installed for them as duke one of their number who was at that time in exile among the Bohemians . 
 The Emperor returned to Hungary in the early summer of 1044 , and was joined in his advance by many Hungarian lords . The decisive battle was fought on 5 June at Ménfő ( near Győr ) , where Samuel Aba 's forces were defeated . Although Aba escaped from the battlefield , Peter 's supporters soon captured and killed him . 
 = = = Second rule ( 1044 – 1046 ) = = = 
 Following Samuel Aba 's death , Emperor Henry entered Székesfehérvár and restored Peter . Peter introduced Bavarian law in his realm , which suggests that Hungary became an imperial fief . He accepted the Emperor 's suzerainty on Whitsun 1045 , giving his royal lance to his overlord ( who returned to Hungary ) . A number of plots to overthrow Peter indicate that he remained unpopular . Two of King Stephen I 's maternal cousins ( <unk> and <unk> ) conspired against Peter in 1045 , but the King had them arrested , tortured and executed . Bishop Gerard of Csanád invited Vazul 's exiled sons to the country . An uprising by pagan commoners ended Peter 's second rule in 1046 . Peter planned to flee again to the Holy Roman Empire , but Vazul 's son Andrew ( who had returned to Hungary ) invited him to a meeting at Székesfehérvár . The deposed king soon realised that Andrew 's envoys actually wanted to arrest him . He fled to a fortified manor at <unk> , but his opponent 's supporters seized it and captured him three days later . All 14th @-@ century Hungarian chronicles attest that Peter was blinded , which caused his death . However , the near @-@ contemporary Cosmas of Prague relates that Judith of Schweinfurt , widow of Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia who was expelled by her son , fled to Hungary and married Peter about 1055 " as an insult to " her son " and all the Czechs " . If the latter report is reliable , Peter survived the ordeal and died during the late 1050s . He was buried in the cathedral of Pécs . 
 The following autumn the Hungarians remembered their former treachery and set up a certain Andreas as their king . They killed the many foreigners who had fought for King Peter ; they inflicted various injuries on him and his wife and finally they deprived Peter of his eyes and sent him , together with his wife , to be kept in a certain place . At the same time many foreigners in that country were despoiled , exiled and killed . 
 King Peter , seeing that the Hungarians had with one mind taken the part of Dukes Andreas and Levente , took flight with his [ Germans ] towards <unk> , intending to cross from there into Austria , but he could not escape . For the Hungarians had been beforehand and had occupied the gateways and <unk> of the kingdom ; moreover the ambassador of Duke Andreas called King Peter back under the pretext of wishing to come to a peaceable and honourable agreement with him . Believing him , King Peter returned [ ... ] . When he turned aside to the village of <unk> , the aforesaid ambassador wished to take him in an ambush and to bring him bound to Duke Andreas ; but having knowledge of this , Peter took refuge in a mansion and defended himself bravely for three days . At last all his soldiers were killed by arrows and he himself was taken alive ; he was blinded and brought to Alba , where in great pain he soon ended his life .

 The name and family of Peter 's wife are unknown , but Gyula Kristó suggests that she was of German origin .

On the other hand , Kristó writes that Cosmas 's report may suggest that Peter survived his blinding . The following family tree presents Peter the Venetian 's ancestors and his relatives who are mentioned in the article :

 = The Lives of a Bengal Lancer ( film ) = 
 The Lives of a Bengal Lancer is a 1935 American epic @-@ adventure @-@ drama film loosely adapted from the 1930 autobiography of the same name by British author Francis Yeats @-@ Brown . The film is a Paramount picture directed by Henry Hathaway and written by Grover Jones , William Slavens McNutt , Waldemar Young , John L. Balderston and <unk> Abdullah . 
 The plot of the film , which bears little resemblance to Brown 's book , tells the story of a group of British cavalrymen and high @-@ ranking officers desperately trying to defend their stronghold and headquarters at Bengal against the rebellious natives during the days of the British Raj . It stars Gary Cooper as Lieutenant Alan McGregor , Franchot Tone as Lieutenant John Forsythe , Richard Cromwell as Lieutenant Donald Stone , Guy Standing as Colonel Tom Stone and Douglass Dumbrille as the rebel leader Mohammed Khan , who utters the frequently misquoted line " We have ways to make men talk . " 
 Production and planning of the film began in 1931 and Paramount expected the film to be released that same year . However , due to a film stock crisis in which most of the location footage deteriorated due to the high temperatures , the project was delayed for four years . The motion picture was released in American cinemas in January 1935 . 
 The film 's release was met with positive reviews and good box office results . The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards , winning Assistant Director , with other nominations including Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture . It grossed $ 49 million ( 2008 equivalent of $ 1 @.@ 5 million in the 1930s ) at the box office . Historian John Reid has described the film as " one of the greatest adventure films of all time " .

 On the northwest frontier of India during the British Raj , Scottish Canadian Lieutenant Alan McGregor ( Gary Cooper ) , in charge of newcomers , welcomes two replacements to the 41st Bengal Lancers , Lieutenant John Forsythe ( Franchot Tone ) and Lieutenant Donald Stone ( Richard Cromwell ) , the son of the unit 's commander , Colonel Tom Stone ( Guy Standing ) . Lieutenant Stone volunteered to serve on the Indian front solely in the belief that his father specifically sent for him , while Lieutenant Forsythe , an experienced cavalrymen and somewhat of a teasing character , is simply sent off as a replacement for an officer who recently died . After the formal introduction , Lieutenant Stone realizes his father never actually sent for him during a heated argument , a discovery that breaks his heart . In attempt to show impartiality , the colonel treats his son very coldly , which is misinterpreted and causes frustration and resentment in the young officer . 
 Lieutenant Barrett ( Colin Tapley ) has been disguised as a native rebel in order to spy on Mohammed Khan ( Douglass Dumbrille ) , and reports that Khan has been preparing an uprising against the British and is planning to intercept and steal a future military transport of two million rounds of ammunition . When Khan discovers the British regiment knows of his plan , he orders his beautiful slave to seduce and then kidnap Lieutenant Stone , in an attempt to extract sensitive information about the ammunition caravan from him . When the colonel refuses to attempt his rescue , McGregor and Forsythe , appalled by the " lack of concern " the colonel has for his own son , leave the camp at night without orders . Disguised as common natives trying to sell blankets , they are recognized by the beautiful slave , who has met the two men before at a civil event , and are captured . During a seemingly friendly interrogation , Khan says " we have ways of making men talk " and proceeds to have the prisoners tortured ; their nails are ripped off and the sensitive skin underneath is burned . While McGregor and Forsythe , despite the agonizing pain , refuse to speak , Stone cracks and reveals what he knows . As a result , the ammunition is captured . 
 After receiving news about the stolen ammunition , Colonel Stone prepares his regiment for battle . From their cell , the captives see the outmatched Bengal Lancers deployed to assault Khan 's fortress . They manage to escape and ultimately destroy the ammunition tower , and young Stone redeems himself by killing Khan with a dagger . With their ammunition gone and headquarters in ruins as a result of the battle , the remaining rebels surrender . However , McGregor , who was mainly responsible for the destruction of the ammunition tower , is killed in the assault . To recognize their battlefield bravery and military effort , Forsythe and Lieutenant Stone are awarded the Distinguished Service Order and McGregor posthumously receives the prestigious Victoria Cross , with McGregor 's horse awarded the medal on his behalf .

 German dictator Adolf Hitler told British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in 1937 that one of his favorite films was The Lives of a Bengal Lancer , which he had seen three times .

Jill is featured in several Resident Evil games including Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis , Resident Evil : The Umbrella Chronicles , Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil : Revelations , where she is in conflict against the shadowy company Umbrella Corporation and its splinter groups . Jill is also a founding member and key field operative of the paramilitary organization BSAA . 
 Jill has received favorable critical reception , having been described as " a classic example " of a female horror game character , and featuring on numerous top character lists . She is also widely regarded as one of the most attractive female protagonists in video games , and has sparked video game internet memes . The film series ' version of Jill was portrayed by Sienna Guillory and based on the game character 's various incarnations .

 Jill Valentine first appears as one of two playable main protagonists of the original Resident Evil game ( 1996 ) , in which she is an explosives expert of Raccoon Police Department 's Special Tactics And Rescue Service ( STARS ) and a partner to Chris Redfield . Jill 's family ethnic background is half @-@ French , half @-@ Japanese , and she is a former operative of the U.S. Army 's secretive special unit known as Delta Force , where she was an explosives expert . Before the game begins , the STARS , including Jill 's Alpha team , are deployed to investigate a series of bizarre murders in the Arklay Mountains , a fictional area , where they discover and enter Umbrella Corporation 's Arklay Research Facility biological warfare site . Inside , with Chris missing , Jill initially works with Barry Burton , another Alpha team member , as they inspect the mansion and battle its undead residents . Eventually , she and Chris discover that STARS commander , Captain Wesker , had betrayed them . After defeating the monster Tyrant released by Wesker , Jill escapes the self @-@ destructing mansion in Brad Vickers ' helicopter along with Chris , Barry and the Bravo team 's sole survivor Rebecca Chambers . 
 Jill returns as the protagonist of Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis ( 1999 ) , where she is forced to side with a mercenary named Carlos Oliveira , a member of the Umbrella Corporation 's paramilitary force who was betrayed by their employer . Through the game , Jill and Carlos cooperate to escape from the now @-@ dead Raccoon City before it is destroyed with a nuclear strike by the U.S. government . Along the way , they fight Nemesis , a modified Tyrant super soldier sent by Umbrella to dispose of the remaining STARS members . After several encounters with Nemesis , Jill is infected with the <unk> T @-@ virus , though Carlos is able to procure a vaccine from the nearby hospital . Finally , Jill defeats Nemesis and Barry Burton returns to Raccoon City to bring her and Carlos to safety moments before the city 's destruction . Jill is also featured as a playable character in the " Heroes Mode " multiplayer section of the non @-@ canon spin @-@ off game Resident Evil : Operation Raccoon City ( 2012 ) . 
 Emerging alive from the Raccoon City outbreak , Jill becomes the founding member of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance ( BSAA ) under the United Nations . In Resident Evil : The Umbrella Chronicles ( 2007 ) , she works with Chris Redfield to expose and destroy the Umbrella Corporation by raiding their research facility in Russia , defeating Umbrella 's newest bioweapon creature , T @-@ <unk> . Jill is also the sole protagonist in Resident Evil : Genesis ( 2008 ) , an alternative @-@ story version of the original Resident Evil game . Before the events of Resident Evil 5 ( 2009 ) , Jill apparently dies while saving Chris during a confrontation with Wesker . During the game , however , Chris finds information suggesting that she may still be alive . Eventually , he discovers that Jill is under control of Wesker , who used Jill 's DNA and the remnants of the T @-@ virus within her body to perfect his new Uroboros virus . Chris and his new partner Sheva Alomar manage to subdue Jill and free her from Wesker 's influence . Jill then works with a fellow BSAA agent Josh Stone , Sheva 's mentor , to assist Chris and Sheva in defeating Wesker . Demand from fans wishing to play as Jill led to two additional DLC scenarios ( also included in the Gold Edition of Resident Evil 5 ) : Lost in Nightmares , showing the events leading up to Jill 's disappearance , and Desperate Escape , showing her fight to escape the facility she was being held in . She is also one of the playable characters in Resident Evil : The Mercenaries 3D ( 2011 ) , an action game based on " The Mercenaries " minigame from Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5 . 
 In Resident Evil : Revelations ( 2012 ) , set in 2005 , Jill goes on a rescue mission to save Chris from the grip of the bioterrorist group Il Veltro , following a transmission from a luxury cruise ship Queen Zenobia , which turns out to be a trap set for her . Jill and her new partner , Parker <unk> , now out of contact and uninformed of the dire situation they face , find the ship infested with a new breed of leech @-@ like zombies , infected with a new , stronger strain of the T @-@ virus : the T @-@ Abyss virus . Meanwhile , Chris and his new partner Jessica make their way to the ship to find Jill and some answers .

During this mission Jill is exposed to the T @-@ Abyss and receives an experimental vaccine . 
 Outside of the Resident Evil series , Jill appears as a player character in the crossover fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom 2 : New Age of Heroes ( 2000 ) , wearing her STARS uniform . She returns as a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 : Fate of Two Worlds and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 ( 2011 ) , where her design is based on her appearance in Resident Evil 5 , available as downloadable content . In addition , she also makes a guest appearance in Under the Skin ( alongside Carlos and Nemesis ) and has a character card in the SNK vs. Capcom : Card Fighters Clash series . She also appears as a playable character in the crossover tactical role @-@ playing games Project X Zone and its sequel , wearing her costume from Revelations , and in the browser @-@ based social game Onimusha Soul ( 2013 ) , where she was re @-@ designed to fit the feudal Japan theme . 
 = = = Design and portrayal = = = 
 During development of the original Resident Evil , Jill was conceived as physically weaker than the game 's male protagonist Chris Redfield , but she was given more skills and weapons to compensate for this . The game 's director Shinji Mikami said about Jill and Claire Redfield : " I don 't know if I 've put more emphasis on women characters , but when I do introduce them , it is never as objects . In some games , they will be peripheral characters with ridiculous breast physics . I avoid that sort of obvious eroticism . I also don 't like female characters who are submissive to male characters , or to the situation they 're in . I won 't portray women in that way . I write women characters who discover their interdependence as the game progresses , or who already know they are independent but have that tested against a series of challenges . " The development team for Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis , which was also overseen by Mikami , said Jill was deliberately designed to make her " beautiful for everybody " and appeal to both male and female gamers , as males would find her physically attractive and females would see her as a tough role model . 
 For the 2002 remake of Resident Evil , Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi said the team wanted Jill to be " a little cuter " so that " her action and atmosphere has charm " . Her facial and physical appearance from the remake onwards is based on Canadian model and actress Julia Voth , and her body was scanned into computers to make her look as much like Voth as possible . Character designer Kenichiro Yoshimura said that he " made Jill 's face as much similar as I could to the model actress face . " However , so that she remains a tough character , her body is designed to be " not skinny , more like muscular " . She post a picture of herself cosplaying Jill on her Instagram page . 
 On the subject of changes to Jill and Chris Redfield 's appearance in Resident Evil 5 , production director Yasuhiro Anpo said that he tried " to preserve their image and imagined how they would have changed over the passage of time " and so they " made a new design that retained their signature color — green for Chris , blue for Jill — to carry over the same look from the past . The facial structures are mainly based on the visuals of the Nintendo GameCube version , and we added various details to these in order to develop a realistic structure . " Jill 's character model was paler than usual in this entry to the series and her hair was blonde , both of which were explained in @-@ universe as being due to a pigment abnormality sustained while her body was under experimentation . Capcom producer Jun Takeuchi said Jill 's unlockable " classic look " STARS uniform from the original game was his favorite extra costume in Resident Evil 5 . 
 Jill was voiced by Catherine Disher in Resident Evil 3 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 . Heidi Anderson voiced her in the 2002 GameCube remake of the first game . Patricia Ja Lee , who provided the voice and motion capture in The Umbrella Chronicles , Resident Evil 5 and all of its later released downloadable content ( DLC ) , and Resident Evil : The Mercenaries 3D , compared physical part of the auditions for the role to applying to the LAPD . Lee said that although she did her research and " looked up the previous Jills " , she was given a lot of freedom to reinvent the character due to the changes that Jill underwent in @-@ universe . Kari Wahlgren assumed the role in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 ; Michelle Ruff lent her voice to the character in Resident Evil : Revelations and Resident Evil : Operation Raccoon City . Ruff said about her role : " Jills 's voice says a lot about her personality . I kept her in my lower register . She 's all business and not ' girly ' at all . Almost military @-@ ish . "

 Jill was one of the first two player characters in the Resident Evil series . In the original game , Jill plays very differently to Chris as she runs slower , can take less damage and is less accurate with firearms , but has two more inventory slots and an access to stronger weapons ( including starting armed with a gun , while Chris begins with only a knife ) . She also carries a <unk> capable of opening many doors and caches , knows how to play piano ( which is useful in @-@ game ) , and is aided by the overprotective Barry . In the game 's 2002 remake , she has a taser as her personal defensive weapon . In Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis , Jill will enter the " Live Selection Mode " during certain sections of the game , in which the player is prompted to quickly choose between one of two possible actions ( the choice of action affects the direction of the game and story , including which ending the player receives ) . It was also during this game that Jill became the first character to be able to perform a quick 180 @-@ degree turn , which has since become a staple of the series . 
 In Marvel vs. Capcom 2 , Jill is a very fast and agile character that is able to summon monsters to attack her opponent . She can also heal the player 's active character if she is summoned as a support character .

Guillory was set to appear in the sequel , Resident Evil : Extinction , but she had commitments to other work . Later , producers Paul W. S. Anderson and Jeremy Bolt decided to have Claire Redfield appear alongside the film 's lead , Alice . Guillory said she was " incredibly proud to be a part of this " and felt " there is no greater motivator than knowing you 're going to be squaring off against Milla Jovovich [ Alice ] in a cat @-@ suit months after giving birth to twins , " but she had problems with Jill 's " boob @-@ <unk> " mind control device prop during the fifth film 's production .

 Jill Valentine has been received favorably by critics as the Resident Evil series ' main female protagonist , and remains one of its most recognizable characters . Jill was described as the " best super heroine this side of Lara Croft " by Duluth News Tribune in 2002 and " as widely seen by Resident Evil fans as the series ' character of all characters " by Official PlayStation Magazine Australia in 2004 . She was chosen as one of the 20 " muses " of video games by Brazilian magazine <unk> in 2001 . In 2008 , GameDaily ranked her as their tenth most favorite Capcom character of all time and used her as an example for the archetype " smart and sexy heroine " . In the Guinness World Records Gamer 's Edition of 2011 , Jill was voted the 43rd most popular video game character of all time . She was also recognized by Guinness World Records 2013 : Gamer 's Edition as " the first female player character in a survival @-@ horror game " . That same year , Complex and GamingBolt both included her among the greatest video game mascots , and GamesRadar staff included this " highly capable officer " among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcom 's history . 
 In 2005 , Bonnie Ruberg of The Escapist called her " a classic example " of horror game female characters who fill the role of the heroine , as " she 's tightly clothed , but not outrageously so , and she can shoot herself a mean zombie . " In 2007 , Jill was listed by Tom 's Hardware among the 50 greatest female characters in video game history , described there as " a true survivor and an elite fighting machine , not to mention a drop @-@ dead gorgeous brunette . " GameDaily listed Jill among the ten " babes who should meet your mom " , where she was described as both noble and confident even as having a questionable fashion sense , as well as the " chicks who will kick your ass " ( along with Ada , Claire and Sheva ) , and ranked her as 26th among the " 50 hottest game babes " . According to GamesRadar 's Brett Elston , Jill has " emerged as perhaps the most sensible design of the period [ of mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s ] , being both tough and sexy without shedding her clothes at the first sign of trouble . " In 2009 , Elston listed her among the 11 heroines that " embody the best of videogame girls " , also confessing that Jill was his first game crush for " her normal name , normal build and normal demeanor , trapped in the most abnormal of situations . " In 2010 , James Hawkins of Joystick Division ranked Jill as the second top " badass lady " in video games , chosen for her perseverance . In the 2011 " battle of the beauties " feature , Complex pitted Jill against Claire Redfield in the category " zombie killer " , choosing her over Claire . In 2012 , Nathan Misa of MMGN graded her the fifth top " hottest and modest " female protagonists in gaming , writing that in the original game Jill was " portrayed realistically and appropriately . " That same year , Adam Dodd of Cheat Code Central chose this " sultry S.T.A.R.S. member " among " many capable women in the Resident Evil series " for his list of top ten " badass " women of video games , <unk> that " Jill is a fan favorite for a reason , as she 's an intimidating mix of brains and beauty , and it certainly helps that she knows her way around a gun . " In 2013 , Jill was ranked as 30th on the list greatest heroine in video game history by Michael Rougeau of Complex , and Tom 's Guide 's Marshall <unk> included her among top ten video game female protagonists , writing that " equally good at gunning down the undead and solving tricky puzzles , Jill set a high standard for heroines in survival @-@ horror games : smart , capable and devoted to her partners . " That same year , the " smart and resourceful " Jill was also similarly ranked as the tenth best female protagonist in gaming by the staff of GamesTM , who stated : " When you think of a lead protagonist for the series , your mind might jump to Chris Redfield or Leon S. Kennedy , but she ’ s the most consistent character throughout the series . When you need a gigantic genetically altered zombie taking down , she 's the girl to do it . " Schuyler J. <unk> of The Escapist included her on his 2014 list of eight " most badass videogame ladies " . 
 One of the celebrated aspects of Jill 's role in the series has been her ongoing partnership with Chris Redfield . James Hawkins of Joystick Division graded Chris and Jill as the fifth top duo in video game history , as " the two of them together make a force that cannot be slowed by even the most sophisticated undead forces . " He explained why the partnership worked so well : " Jill Valentine represents the more intellectual protagonist — the kind that survives on a sharp mind , a thrifty expenditure of resources , and sheer cleverness [ that ] contrasts perfectly Chris Redfield 's machismo " . In 2012 , Brittany Vincent of Complex ranked them as the 15th " most ass @-@ kicking " game duo saying , " Forget Chris and Sheva . Jill is where it 's at " , while PlayStation Universe opined that the duo together form " the nucleus " of the whole series .

In 2008 News.com.au named her as the number one sexiest video game character of all time , noting her popularity with both male and female gamers for different reasons . That same year , she was also featured ninth on the list of top " video game game vixens " by Spike TV , seventh on Virgin Media 's list of top " game babes " , and seventh on Chip 's top " girl of gaming " list . In 2010 Videogamer.com included Jill on the list of top video game crushes , stating that " she sure as hell picked the lock to our heart .

 In 2008 , GamesRadar placed her among the top 20 " overlooked game babes " , stating that " her affinity for adolescent head gear gives her a Blossom vibe that the world has long since rejected for its lack of sex appeal , " with Stephen Pierce calling her " like a big dirty <unk> [ sic ] but with slightly longer hair , no dick and a set of tits . " In 2009 , Jesse Schedeen from IGN named her as one of the characters in all media " who deserve better " due to her treatment in the films and lack of appearances since Resident Evil 3 until a small role in Resident Evil 5 , her roles being " stolen " by Alice and Sheva . Resident Evil 6 producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi wrote in 2012 they have " heard a lot of love for Jill and Claire recently and people asking if they ’ ll be in the next Resident Evil . "

 The line " You were almost a Jill sandwich " , spoken by Barry Burton in the first Resident Evil game after Jill was almost crushed by a falling ceiling trap , sparked an Internet meme of " Jill Sandwich " . Another Jill and Barry @-@ related meme is " Master of Unlocking " , which is based on a dialog line that was featured in the original game and was removed in the remake . UGO featured both of these " hilariously dumb " scenes on their list of the 25 worst cutscenes in gaming history in 2011 , Chris Hoffman from GamesRadar included it among Capcom 's greatest contributions to gaming history in 2013 , and Dave Cook of NowGamer ranked " Jill Sandwich " as the 14th greatest video game meme in 2014 . 
 These memes were referenced by Capcom in the mobile game Resident Evil : Uprising and in the unrelated game Dead Rising ; in 2012 , Complex included Dead Rising 's location named " Jill 's Sandwiches " on a list of the best Easter eggs in video games . The sandwich meme is referenced in Resident Evil : Revelations 2 by Claire , and the unlocking meme is also referenced in the game by Barry . Bandai included the " Master of Unlocking " ( AC @-@ 011 ) card in its Resident Evil collectible card game adaptation . Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami 's non @-@ Capcom game Evil Within features a player trophy called " Master of Unlocking " . 
 = Arena ( web browser ) = 
 The Arena browser ( also known as the Arena WWW Browser ) was an early testbed Web browser and Web authoring tool for Unix . Originally authored by Dave Raggett in 1993 , the browser continued its development at CERN and the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing . As a testbed browser , Arena was used in testing the implementation for HTML version 3 @.@ 0 , Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) , Portable Network Graphics ( PNG ) , and libwww . Arena was widely used and popular at the beginning of the World Wide Web . 
 Arena , which predated Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , featured a number of innovations used later in commercial products . It was the first browser to support background images , tables , text flow around images , and inline mathematical expressions . 
 The Arena browser served as the W3C 's testbed browser from 1994 to 1996 when it was succeeded by the Amaya project . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1993 , Dave Raggett , then at Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) in Bristol , England devoted his spare time to developing Arena on which he hoped to demonstrate new and future HTML specifications . Development of the browser was slow because Raggett was the lone developer and HP , which like many other computer corporations at the time , was unconvinced that the Internet would succeed and thus did not consider investing in web browser development . Raggett demonstrated the browser at the first World Wide Web Conference in Geneva , Switzerland in 1994 and the 1994 <unk> conference in Prague to show text flow around images , forms , and other aspects of HTML later termed as the HTML + specification . Raggett subsequently partnered with CERN , to develop Arena further as a proof of concept browser for this work . Using the Arena browser , Dave Raggett , Henrik <unk> Nielsen , Håkon Wium Lie and others demonstrated text flow around a figure with captions , resizable tables , image backgrounds , HTML math , and other features . At the Web World conference in Orlando , in early 1995 , Raggett demonstrated the different new features of Arena . 
 Since July 1994 Lie was integrating libwww and CSS and helping Raggett . In October 1995 , Yves <unk> joined the team for a year to provide support for HTML form and style sheet development . 
 Arena was originally released for Unix , and although there was talk of a Windows and Macintosh port , neither came to fruition . 
 Despite its time of development , Arena is in certain areas a relatively modern browser ; because it functioned as a testbed , it saw the implementation of new technologies long before they became mainstream , e.g. CSS . Arena implemented many elements of the <unk> and <unk> specification including math elements that were deprecated in <unk> , HTML tables , and experimental style sheets .

 The development history and the source code of earlier software builds are not well documented , because the developers didn 't want to distribute the source code until they considered the browser to be stable . In version 0 @.@ 95 , support for inline JPEG images was added . In version 0 @.@ 96 , support was added for the FTP , <unk> , and Gopher protocols , as well as experimental support for CSS .

 The W3C published 5 versions of the Arena beta @-@ 1 between 27 November 1995 and 8 February 1996 improving 16 @-@ bit operating system support and <unk> CSS ( which was still a Working Draft ) . The W3C and the <unk> , a French national research institution , gave additional funding to develop CSS . To better implement and write CSS , an experimental style sheet for Arena was developed . On 22 May 1996 , the W3C announced that Amaya will replace Arena as their new testbed and that the W3C was looking for a new maintainer because the W3C didn 't have the resources for two testbeds .

 Beta @-@ 2 had two builds ( beta @-@ 2a : 28 February 1996 and beta @-@ 2b : 21 March 1996 ) and introduced a new API for communicating with other applications .

Between the two beta @-@ 3 releases the W3C was already looking at a new testbed and switched later to the Amaya browser . Beta @-@ 3 was the last involvement of the W3C in the development of Arena . On 17 February 1997 , Yggdrasil Computing took over the role of developing the browser . 
 = = = Yggdrasil phase = = = 
 On 17 February 1997 , the W3C approved Yggdrasil to coordinate future development of Arena . Development was taken over by Yggdrasil , with the idea to turn Arena into an open source X Window System browser licensed under the GNU General Public License . Yggdrasil licensed an X emulator from Pearl Software to port Arena to Windows , although these builds were never released . Yggdrasil didn 't provide any official binaries at this time , because they didn 't want to expand the community with alpha @-@ quality software . Although users would be able to run Arena by compiling it from the published source code , volunteers created unofficial finished binaries . Yggdrasil had planned to implement browsing features that were already standard in competitive web browsers , which resulted in the new bookmarks feature in version 0 @.@ 3 @.@ 18 on 7 April 1997 . 
 Development stopped in late 1998 , with the final release being on 25 November 1998 . The W3C did not consider demonstration projects to be high priority , and thus , the Arena browser was entirely shut down in favor of outside Linux @-@ community development .

 Arena has three different systems for the version numbering .

 Although Arena ran well , there were inconsistent reports about the speed of Arena . 
 The biggest problems were that Arena couldn 't handle forms , and that the PNG support was broken from version 0 @.@ 3 @.@ 07 on . Earlier Arena releases had full alpha @-@ channel support , but only with using Arena 's own " sandy " background pattern .

 Soft & Cuddly is a horror arcade adventure game released for the ZX Spectrum home computer , developed by John George Jones and published by The Power House . It was released in September 1987 in the United Kingdom and in early 1988 in Spain . The player assumes the role of a man armed with a laser gun and a jet pack , whose mother , the Android Queen , has been dismembered . The player 's task is to locate the scattered body parts of the Android Queen and sew her back together . 
 Jones had previously developed a gruesome game called Go to Hell . In an interview Jones stated that he developed the game for his own amusement ; he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game . The original , pre @-@ release , version of the game featured more grisly images . Reviewers praised the game 's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics . Some reviewers criticized the game 's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and akin to a horror movie by others . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Soft & Cuddly is a surreal arcade adventure game set in a fantasy horror world of 256 rooms . The player controls the son of the Android Queen . The Queen has imprisoned her husband , the player character 's father , in a refrigerator . The Queen has been dismembered in an accident , leaving her husband in danger of being attacked by evil spirits . 
 The object of the game is to collect the eight pieces of the Android Queen 's body then stitch her back together again . The player must first find and approach the refrigerator in order to be told where the first body part can be found . Once this has been returned to the player 's trapped father , the next body part location will be revealed . Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned to the refrigerator , the player must find a needle and thread in order to restore the Android Queen . The location of the refrigerator is randomized at the beginning of each new game . 
 The game world consists of a number of rooms and passages with background scenery including a machine which stretches four conjoined babies and men being torn apart on racks . The game 's rooms are filled with enemies and traps such as spiked ceilings , falling anvils and airborne spinning blades . The player character is armed with a laser gun and a jet pack which is used to fly around the game world . The laser can overheat and become inoperable for a time if not used sparingly . Scenery and surfaces can be degraded then destroyed by repeated laser fire , allowing access to adjacent rooms which would otherwise be unreachable or require a detour . The player starts each game with three lives ; the game 's display features a heart strength indicator which is reduced each time the player is injured . If the player loses all their heart strength , their heart stops , resulting in a lost life . Players can render themselves invisible and invincible for a limited period three times on a single life . When the player character is invisible , he can fire the laser in order to determine his current location .

 Soft & Cuddly was developed for The Power house by John George Jones . Jones had previously developed Go to Hell for Triple Six . Go to Hell was published in 1985 and featured " ... revolting , crude and downright vile images . " When interviewed by Sinclair User , in the October 1987 issue , the programmer was asked " Whatever possessed you to write a game like Soft and Cuddly ... " . To this Jones responded , " I didn 't write the game because I 'm a horrible person , I wrote it to amuse myself . " Jones also stated " I love the reaction people give , I can 't stand ' nice ' inoffensive things ... " . The original version of the game was more gruesome ; the babies were being torn apart rather than stretched and " ... the sheep was bouncing up and down on a corpse . " When asked how long he would retain interest in computers , Jones stated that he had already lost interest . Soft & Cuddly was released by The Power house during September 1987 in the United Kingdom . The game was later released in Spain during the first quarter of 1988 . The game featured in a competition printed in the November 1987 issue of Sinclair User . The first prize was a day in the company of The Power House 's staff including a trip to the London Dungeon . Other prize winners received a copy of Soft & Cuddly or a poster of the game 's inlay artwork .

 Soft & Cuddly received average review scores from critics . The game 's graphics were praised ; Sinclair User reviewer Jim Douglas stated " Graphically , it is certainly unusual , and occasionally brilliant . " Crash magazine 's three reviewers also praised the graphics but raised some issues . Nick Roberts described them as smooth and slick , but stated that they were " a mite sketchy " . Roberts also stated " colour is used very well . " Paul Sumner stated " There are some cleverly @-@ animated and attractively @-@ coloured graphics " . Robin Candy said they are the game 's greatest asset . 
 Reviewers held differing opinions on the game 's setting and themes . Sumner stated the game is " dragged down by distasteful graphics and a horribly grim inlay . " Roberts described the game as " sick " , adding " I only recommend Soft & Cuddly to those of you who cut your toenails with a carving knife ! " Douglas was critical of the game 's themes ; he described playing Soft & Cuddly as " watching very large and unpleasant graphics jigging up and down like a box of offal " . Tony Lee of Your Sinclair was more positive , stating , " This is a very sick game indeed , but fortunately I have a very sick sense of humour . " 
 The overall game received a more positive reception from Lee and MicroHobby magazine 's reviewer as opposed to the reviewers from Crash and Sinclair User . MicroHobby 's reviewer called Soft & Cuddly a typical arcade adventure with a performance worthy of a horror movie . Douglas stated , " The actual playing of the game is , unfortunately , a rather tiresome business . " He criticized the game for consisting of character movement coupled with occasional item gathering . Douglas described the game 's enemies as being " bog standard cannon fodder aliens " , saying " they drift around being annoying and sapping your energy . " Candy stated that " It 's very easy to get into , but boring . " He added that exploration is the best part of the game but becomes repetitive . Sumner stated " all there is to Soft & Cuddly is graphics . The gameplay is repetitive . " Lee said that the game is fun ; " I love this one . " 
 = Prickly shark = 
 The prickly shark ( Echinorhinus cookei ) is one of the two species of sharks in the family <unk> ( the other one is the bramble shark ) , found in the Pacific Ocean over continental and insular shelves and slopes , and in submarine canyons . Bottom @-@ dwelling in nature , it generally inhabits cool waters 100 – 650 m ( 330 – 2 @,@ 130 ft ) deep , but it also frequently enters shallower water in areas such as Monterey Bay off California . This stocky , dark @-@ colored shark grows up to 4 @.@ 0 m ( 13 @.@ 1 ft ) long , with two small dorsal fins positioned far back on its body and no anal fin . It is characterized by a dense covering of thorn @-@ like dermal denticles , hence its common name . 
 <unk> active , the prickly shark rests during the day in deeper offshore waters and performs a diel migration to shallower inshore waters at dusk . Individual sharks have a small home range and tend to remain within a given local area . This species consumes a variety of bony and cartilaginous fishes , and cephalopods . Since it moves slowly , it may use suction to capture prey . It is aplacental viviparous , with females producing sizable litters . The prickly shark is not known to be dangerous to humans and has minimal economic value . It is caught incidentally by commercial deepwater fisheries , which are expanding and may potentially threaten its population . Thus , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as Near Threatened . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Austrian ichthyologist Viktor <unk> described the prickly shark as a new species in two separate publications : a brief German account in a 1928 volume of Anzeiger der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien and a more detailed English account in a 1930 volume of Bishop Museum Bulletin . <unk> named the shark in honor of C. Montague Cooke Jr . , a conchologist at the Bishop Museum . However , prickly sharks were continually misidentified as bramble sharks ( E. brucus ) and referred to as such in scientific literature until 1960 , when Jack Garrick redescribed the species . Since the original holotype from Kauai , Hawaii had been lost , Garrick designated a 2 @.@ 0 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) long male from Palliser Bay , New Zealand as a new type specimen . Other common names for this species include Cook 's bramble shark and spinous shark . 
 = = Description = = 
 The prickly shark has a flabby and cylindrical body , with the adults markedly bulkier than juveniles , and a short , moderately flattened head . The nostrils are placed far apart and preceded by small flaps of skin . The spiracles are tiny and positioned well behind the eyes , which lack nictitating membranes . The mouth forms a broad arch , with very short furrows at the corners . There are 21 – 25 and 20 – 27 tooth rows in the upper and lower jaws respectively . The knife @-@ like teeth each have a strongly angled main cusp flanked by up to three smaller cusplets on either side ; the lateral cusplets are absent in young sharks . There are five pairs of gill slits , with the fifth pair the longest . 
 The lateral line runs along each side of body in a conspicuous furrow . The pectoral fins are short , while the pelvic fins are relatively large with long bases . The first dorsal fin is small and originates at or behind the level of the pelvic fin origins ; the second dorsal fin is similar to the first and positioned close behind . The anal fin is absent , and the stout caudal peduncle lacks depressions at the caudal fin origins . The caudal fin has a longer upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin , and an indistinct lower lobe . The skin has a dense , uniform covering of non @-@ overlapping dermal denticles measuring up to 0 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) across , which are never fused together as in the bramble shark . Each denticle is thorn @-@ like , with strong ridges running down the central spine and radiating out over the star @-@ shaped base . The denticles beneath the snout are very fine in adults . The prickly shark is plain brown or gray , often with a purplish tint , and has black trailing margins on the fins . The underside is paler , most obviously on the snout and around the mouth . It may reach a length of 4 @.@ 0 m ( 13 @.@ 1 ft ) . The maximum recorded weight is 266 kg ( 586 lb ) for a 3 @.@ 1 m ( 10 ft ) long female . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The prickly shark is widely distributed around the Pacific Ocean . In the western and central Pacific , it has been reported off Japan , Taiwan , Victoria and Queensland in Australia , and New Zealand , as well as around the islands of Palau , New Caledonia , Tonga , Hawaii , and possibly the Gilberts . In the eastern Pacific , it is known to occur from Oregon to El Salvador ( including the Gulf of California ) , around the Cocos and Galapagos Islands , and off Peru and Chile . This species generally seems to be uncommon ; an exception is in Monterey Canyon off California , where sharks of both sexes are abundant throughout the year . 
 Favoring cooler temperatures of 5 @.@ 5 – 11 ° C ( 41 @.@ 9 – 51 @.@ 8 ° F ) , the prickly shark is mostly found below depths of 100 – 200 m ( 330 – 660 ft ) , particularly in the tropics . It has been recorded from at least 650 m ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) down and may occur much deeper , possibly to 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) . On the other hand , at higher latitudes it frequently enters shallow inshore waters ; for example , in Monterey Canyon it can be consistently found at depths of 15 – 35 m ( 49 – 115 ft ) , and off Moss Landing one individual was captured in water only 4 m ( 13 ft ) deep . This shark inhabits continental and insular shelves and slopes , where it swims close to the bottom . It can also be found inside submarine canyons , close to the walls . It prefers areas with a muddy or sandy substrate . It is tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels , allowing it to inhabit oceanic basins inaccessible to other sharks . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The prickly shark is a slow swimmer and has been observed hovering just above the sea floor . A tracking study in Monterey Canyon found that this species exhibits strong diel migration patterns . The sharks were inactive during the day , resting in discrete refuge areas located near the sea floor in deep , offshore waters . They became active at dusk , swimming towards the coast to the head of the canyon and rising into the water column ; this upward movement is likely related to feeding on schooling fishes . Individual sharks seldom strayed from the local area and had very small home ranges , no more than 2 @.@ 2 km2 ( 0 @.@ 85 sq mi ) . The prickly sharks in Monterey Canyon regularly form aggregations that may number over thirty . 
 The size and structure of the prickly shark 's mouth and pharynx suggests that it uses suction to capture prey . This species feeds on a variety of benthic and pelagic bony fishes , including hake , flounders , rockfishes , lingcod , <unk> , mackerel , and herring , and on cartilaginous fishes , including <unk> ( <unk> ) , spiny dogfish ( Squalus acanthias ) , young bluntnose sixgill sharks ( Hexanchus griseus ) , and ghost catshark ( <unk> ) egg cases . Octopuses and squid , including the Humboldt squid ( <unk> gigas ) are also consumed . Young prickly sharks may themselves fall prey to the bluntnose sixgill shark , while adults likely face few threats . Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous , with the unborn young sustained by yolk . There is only one known record of a pregnant female , which was gestating 114 embryos ; this ranks among the largest known litters from any shark . The young are probably under 40 cm ( 16 in ) long at birth . The length at sexual maturity has not been precisely determined but is thought to be around 2 @.@ 0 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) for males and 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 0 m ( 8 @.@ 2 – 9 @.@ 8 ft ) for females . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Interactions with divers show that the prickly shark behaves <unk> towards humans , either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached . It is susceptible to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls , gillnets , or line gear . It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened , citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries . 
 = The Notorious B.I.G. = 
 Christopher George <unk> Wallace ( May 21 , 1972 – March 9 , 1997 ) , better known by his stage names The Notorious B.I.G , Biggie , or Biggie Smalls , was an American rapper . He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time . 
 Wallace was raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City . When he released his debut album Ready to Die in 1994 , he became a central figure in the East Coast hip hop scene and increased New York 's visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop was dominant in the mainstream . The following year , Wallace led his childhood friends to chart success through his protégé group , Junior M.A.F.I.A. While recording his second album , Wallace was heavily involved in the growing East Coast – West Coast hip hop feud . 
 On March 9 , 1997 , Wallace was killed by an unknown assailant in a drive @-@ by shooting in Los Angeles . His double @-@ disc album Life After Death , released 16 days later , rose to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts and was certified Diamond in 2000 , one of the few hip hop albums to receive this certification . Wallace was noted for his " loose , easy flow " , dark semi @-@ autobiographical lyrics and storytelling abilities . Two more albums have been released since his death . He has certified sales of 17 million units in the United States .

 = = = 1972 – 94 : Early life , arrests , career beginnings and first child = = = 
 Born in St. Mary 's Hospital in Brooklyn on May 21 , 1972 , as the only child of Voletta Wallace , a Jamaican preschool teacher , and Selwyn George <unk> , a welder and small @-@ time Jamaican politician . His father left the family when Wallace was two years old , and his mother worked two jobs while raising him . Wallace grew up in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn , New York City on 226 St. James Place near the border of Bedford @-@ Stuyvesant , considered at the time to be within the latter neighborhood 's boundaries . At the Queen of All Saints Middle School , Wallace excelled in class , winning several awards as an English student . He was nicknamed " Big " because of his overweight size by age 10 . He said he started dealing when he was around the age of 12 . His mother , often away at work , did not know of her son 's drug sales until Wallace was an adult . 
 At his request , Wallace transferred out of the Roman Catholic Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School to attend the state @-@ funded George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School , which future rappers DMX , Jay @-@ Z and Busta Rhymes also attended at the time . According to his mother , Wallace was still a good student , but he developed a " smart @-@ ass " attitude at the new school . At seventeen , Wallace dropped out of school and became further involved in crime . In 1989 , he was arrested on weapons charges in Brooklyn and sentenced to five years ' probation . In 1990 , he was arrested on a violation of his probation . A year later , Wallace was arrested in North Carolina for dealing crack cocaine . He spent nine months in jail before making bail . 
 Wallace began rapping when he was a teenager . He entertained people on the streets and performed with local groups the Old Gold Brothers and the Techniques . After being released from jail , Wallace made a demo tape under the name Biggie Smalls , a reference to a character in the 1975 film Let 's Do It Again as well as his stature ; he stood at 6 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 91 m ) and weighed as much as 300 to 380 pounds ( 140 – 170 kg ) according to differing accounts . The tape was reportedly made with no serious intent of getting a recording deal , but was promoted by New York @-@ based DJ Mister Cee , who had previously worked with Big Daddy Kane , and was heard by the editor of The Source . 
 In March 1992 , Wallace was featured in The Source 's Unsigned Hype column , dedicated to aspiring rappers , and made a recording off the back of this success . The demo tape was heard by Uptown Records A & R and record producer Sean Combs , who arranged for a meeting with Wallace . He was signed to Uptown immediately and made an appearance on label mates , Heavy D & the Boyz ' " A <unk> Niggas " ( from the album Blue Funk ) . Soon after signing his recording contract , Combs was fired from Uptown and started a new label . Wallace followed and in mid @-@ 1992 , signed to Combs ' new imprint label , Bad Boy Records . 
 On August 8 , 1993 , Wallace 's longtime girlfriend gave birth to his first child , T <unk> . Wallace had split with the girlfriend for some time before T <unk> 's birth . Wallace wanted his daughter to complete her education , despite being a high school dropout himself . Wallace said that if his mother had promised him what he promised his daughter , everything she wanted , Wallace would have been not only a graduate but also at the top of his class . He continued selling drugs after the birth to support his daughter financially . Once Combs discovered this , he forced Wallace to quit . 
 Later in the year , Wallace gained exposure on a remix to Mary J. Blige 's single " Real Love " , under the pseudonym The Notorious B.I.G. He recorded under this name for the remainder of his career , after finding the original moniker " Biggie Smalls " was already in use . " Real Love " peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was followed by a remix of Blige 's " What 's the 411 ? " . He continued this success , to a lesser extent , on remixes with Neneh Cherry ( " Buddy X " ) and reggae artist Super Cat ( " Dolly My Baby " , also featuring Combs ) in 1993 . In April 1993 , his solo track , " Party and Bullshit " , appeared on the Who 's the Man ? soundtrack . In July 1994 , he appeared alongside LL Cool J and Busta Rhymes on a remix to label mate Craig Mack 's " Flava in Ya Ear " , reaching No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 . 
 = = = 1994 : Ready to Die and marriage = = = 
 On August 4 , 1994 , Wallace married R & B singer Faith Evans after they met at a Bad Boy photoshoot . Five days later , Wallace had his first pop chart success as a solo artist with double A @-@ side , " Juicy / Unbelievable " , which reached No. 27 as the lead single to his debut album . 
 Ready to Die was released on September 13 , 1994 , and reached No. 13 on the Billboard 200 chart , eventually being certified four times Platinum . The album , released at a time when West Coast hip hop was prominent in the U.S. charts , according to Rolling Stone , " almost single @-@ handedly ... shifted the focus back to East Coast rap " . It immediately gained strong reviews and has received much praise in retrospect . In addition to " Juicy " , the record produced two hit singles : the Platinum @-@ selling " Big Poppa " , which reached No. 1 on the U.S. rap chart , and " One More Chance " featuring Faith Evans , a loosely related remix of an album track and its best selling single . 
 Busta Rhymes claimed to have seen Wallace giving out free copies of Ready to Die from his home , which Rhymes reasoned as " his way of marketing himself . " Around the time of the album 's release , Wallace became friends with Tupac Shakur , also a rapper . Cousin Lil ' Cease recalled the pair being close , often traveling together whenever they were not active in furthering their careers . According to him , Wallace was a frequent guest at Shakur 's home and they constantly spent time together when Shakur was in California or Washington , D.C .. It was claimed by <unk> , an Oakland emcee , that Wallace 's style was inspired by that of Shakur . Wallace also formed a friendship with Shaquille O 'Neal , O 'Neal remembering his first time hearing Wallace , during listening to the song " Gimme the Loot " , where Wallace mentioned him in the lyrics and thereby attracted O 'Neal to his music . O 'Neal requested a collaboration with Wallace , which resulted in the song " You Can 't Stop the Reign " . Sean Combs related that Wallace would not do collaborations with " anybody he didn 't really respect " , adding that Wallace paid O 'Neal " respect by shouting him out . " Daz Dillinger said in 2015 that Wallace and he were " cool " . Wallace would travel to meet with him , Dillinger remembering serving him weed and recording two songs with him .

 In August 1995 , Wallace 's protégé group , Junior M.A.F.I.A. ( " Junior Masters At Finding Intelligent Attitudes " ) , released their debut album Conspiracy . The group consisted of his friends from childhood and included rappers such as Lil ' Kim and Lil ' Cease , who went on to have solo careers . The record went Gold and its singles , " Player 's Anthem " and " Get Money " both featuring Wallace , went Gold and Platinum . Wallace continued to work with R & B artists , collaborating with R & B groups 112 ( on " Only You " ) and Total ( on " Can 't You See " ) , with both reaching the top 20 of the Hot 100 . By the end of the year , Wallace was the top @-@ selling male solo artist and rapper on the U.S. pop and R & B charts . In July 1995 , he appeared on the cover of The Source with the caption " The King of New York Takes Over " , a reference to his Frank White alias from the 1990 film King of New York . At the Source Awards in August 1995 , he was named Best New Artist ( Solo ) , Lyricist of the Year , Live Performer of the Year , and his debut Album of the Year . At the Billboard Awards , he was Rap Artist of the Year . 
 In his year of success , Wallace became involved in a rivalry between the East and West Coast hip hop scenes with Shakur , now his former friend . In an interview with Vibe in April 1995 , while serving time in Clinton Correctional Facility , Shakur accused Uptown Records ' founder Andre Harrell , Sean Combs , and Wallace of having prior knowledge of a robbery that resulted in him being shot five times and losing thousands of dollars worth of jewelry on the night of November 30 , 1994 . Though Wallace and his entourage were in the same Manhattan @-@ based recording studio at the time of the shooting , they denied the accusation . Wallace said : " It just happened to be a coincidence that he [ Shakur ] was in the studio . He just , he couldn 't really say who really had something to do with it at the time . So he just kinda ' leaned the blame on me . " In 2012 , a man named Dexter Isaac , serving a life sentence for unrelated crimes , claimed that he attacked Shakur that night and that the robbery was orchestrated by James Rosemond aka Jimmy Henchman . 
 Following his release from prison , Shakur signed to Death Row Records on October 15 , 1995 . Bad Boy Records and Death Row , now business rivals , became involved in an intense quarrel . 
 = = = 1996 : More arrests , Tupac Shakur 's death and second child = = = 
 Wallace began recording his second studio album in September 1995 . The album , recorded in New York , Trinidad , and Los Angeles , was interrupted during its 18 months of creation by injury , legal wranglings and the highly publicized hip hop dispute in which he was involved . During this time , he also worked with R & B / pop singer , songwriter and producer Michael Jackson for the HIStory album . Lil ' Cease claimed in 2013 that Wallace denied his wishes to meet Jackson , citing that he did not " trust Michael with kids " . 
 On March 23 , 1996 , Wallace was arrested outside a Manhattan nightclub for chasing and threatening to kill two autograph seekers , smashing the windows of their taxicab and then pulling one of the fans out and punching them . He pleaded guilty to second @-@ degree harassment and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service . In mid @-@ 1996 , he was arrested at his home in Teaneck , New Jersey , for drug and weapons possession charges . 
 In June 1996 , Shakur released " Hit ' Em Up " , a diss song in which he claimed to have had sex with Wallace 's wife ( at the time estranged ) and that Wallace copied his style and image . Wallace referred to the first claim about his wife 's pregnancy on Jay @-@ Z 's " Brooklyn 's Finest " where he raps : " If Faye ( Faith Evans , his wife at the time ) have twins , she 'd probably have two ' <unk> . Get it ? 2Pac 's ? " However , Wallace did not directly respond to the record during his lifetime , stating in a 1997 radio interview that it was " not [ his ] style " to respond . 
 Shakur was shot multiple times in a drive @-@ by shooting in Las Vegas , Nevada , on September 7 , 1996 , and died six days later on September 13 , 1996 of complications from the gunshot wounds . Rumors of Wallace 's involvement with Shakur 's murder were reported almost immediately . A two @-@ part series Chuck Philips wrote for the Los Angeles Times in 2002 , " Who Killed Tupac Shakur ? " , based on police reports and multiple sources reported that " the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier " and that Wallace paid for the gun . His family publicly denied the report , producing documents purporting to show that the rapper was in New York and New Jersey at the time . The New York Times called the documents inconclusive , stating : 
 The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy 's House , indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the night Shakur was shot . They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session , was In and out / sat around and laid down a ref , shorthand for a reference vocal , the equivalent of a first take . But nothing indicates when the documents were created . And Louis Alfred , the recording engineer listed on the sheets , said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late @-@ night session , not during the day . He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot . We would have heard about it , Mr. Alfred said . " 
 Moreover , Philips ' article was based on multiple sources . As the Assistant Managing Editor of the LA Times Mark <unk> wrote : " Philips ' story has withstood all challenges to its accuracy , ... [ and ] remains the definitive account of the Shakur slaying . " Faith Evans remembered her husband calling her the night of Shakur 's death and crying due to him being in shock . Evans added , " I think it ’ s fair to say he was probably afraid , given everything that was going on at that time and all the hype that was put on this so @-@ called beef that he didn ’ t really have in his heart against anyone . " Wayne Barrow , Wallace 's co @-@ manager at the time , said Wallace was recording the song " Nasty Girl " the night Shakur was shot . Shortly after Shakur 's death , he met with Snoop Dogg , who claimed that Wallace played the song " Somebody Gotta Die " for him , in which Snoop Dogg was mentioned , and declared he never hated Shakur . 
 On October 29 , 1996 , Faith Evans gave birth to Wallace 's son , Christopher " C.J. " Wallace , Jr . The following month , Junior M.A.F.I.A. member Lil ' Kim released her debut album , Hard Core , under Wallace 's direction while the two were having a " love affair " . Lil ' Kim recalled being Wallace 's " biggest fan " and her being " his pride and joy . " In a 2012 interview , Lil ' Kim said Wallace prevented her from doing a remix of the Jodeci single " Love U 4 Life " by locking her in a room and according to her , Wallace stated that she was not " gonna go do no song with them , " likely because of the group 's close affiliation with Tupac and Death Row Records . 
 = = = 1997 : Life After Death and car accident = = = 
 During the recording sessions for his second album , tentatively named " Life After Death ... ' Til Death Do Us Part " , later shortened to Life After Death , Wallace was involved in a car accident that shattered his left leg and temporarily confined him to a wheelchair . The injury forced him to use a cane . He and Lil ' Cease were arrested for smoking marijuana in public and had their car repossessed . Wallace chose a Chevrolet Lumina rental SUV as a substitute , despite Lil ' Cease 's objections . The vehicle had brake problems before the accident but Wallace dismissed them . According to Lil ' Cease , Wallace 's leg was shattered when they hit a rail along with Lil 's Cease 's jaw . Wallace spent months in a hospital following the accident and had to complete therapy . Despite his hospitalization , he continued to work on the album . The accident was referred to in the lyrics of " Long Kiss Goodnight " : " Ya still tickle me , I used to be as strong as Ripple be / Til Lil ' Cease crippled me . " 
 In January 1997 , Wallace was ordered to pay US $ 41 @,@ 000 in damages following an incident involving a friend of a concert promoter who claimed Wallace and his entourage beat him up following a dispute in May 1995 . He faced criminal assault charges for the incident which remains unresolved , but all robbery charges were dropped . Following the events of the previous year , Wallace spoke of a desire to focus on his " peace of mind " . " My mom ... my son ... my daughter ... my family ... my friends are what matters to me now " . 
 = = Death and funeral = = 
 Wallace traveled to Los Angeles in February 1997 , to promote his upcoming second studio album and film a music video for its lead single , " Hypnotize " . The album , Life After Death , was scheduled for release on March 25 , 1997 . 
 On March 7 , he presented an award to Toni Braxton at the 1997 Soul Train Music Awards in Los Angeles and was booed by some of the audience . The following evening , March 8 , Wallace attended an after party hosted by Vibe magazine and Qwest Records at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles . Other guests included Faith Evans , Aaliyah , Sean Combs , and members of the Bloods and Crips gangs . 
 On March 9 , Wallace left in a GMC Suburban SUV at 12 : 30 a.m. ( PST ) . By 12 : 45 a.m. ( PST ) , the streets were crowded with people leaving the event . Wallace 's SUV stopped at a red light at the corner of Wilshire Blvd & South Fairfax Ave 50 yards ( 46 m ) from the museum . A dark colored Chevrolet Impala SS pulled up alongside Wallace 's SUV . The driver of the Impala , a black male dressed in a blue suit and bow tie , rolled down his window , drew a 9mm blue @-@ steel pistol and fired at the SUV . Four bullets hit Wallace . His entourage rushed him to Cedars @-@ Sinai Medical Center , where doctors performed an emergency thoracotomy , but he was pronounced dead at 1 : 15 a.m. ( PST ) , six months after Tupac Shakur was killed . 
 Wallace 's autopsy was released to the public in December 2012 , over a decade after his death . According to the report , three of the four shots were not fatal . The first bullet hit in his left forearm and traveled down to his wrist ; the second hit him in the back , missing all vital organs , and exited through his left shoulder ; and the third hit his outer left thigh and left through his inner thigh . The report said that the third bullet struck " the left side of the scrotum , causing a very shallow , 3 ⁄ 8 inch [ 10 mm ] linear laceration . " The fourth bullet was fatal , entering through his right hip and striking several vital organs , before stopping in his left shoulder area . That bullet struck his colon , liver , heart and upper lobe of his left lung . 
 Wallace 's murder remains unsolved and there are many theories regarding the identities and motives of the murderers . Immediately after the shooting , reports surfaced linking Wallace 's murder to the murder of Tupac Shakur , because of the similarities in the drive @-@ by shootings and the involvement of Shakur and Wallace in the East Coast – West Coast hip hop rivalry . In 1997 , Los Angeles Times authors Chuck Philips and Matt <unk> reported that the key suspect was a member of the Crips acting in service of a personal financial motive . 
 Biggie 's funeral was held on March 18 , 1997 at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in Manhattan . There were among 350 mourners at the funeral , including Queen Latifah , Flava Flav , Mary J. Blige , Lil ' Kim , Lil ' Cease , Run – D.M.C. , DJ Kool Herc , Busta Rhymes , Salt @-@ N @-@ Pepa , DJ <unk> , Foxy Brown , Sister <unk> and others . After the funeral , his body was cremated and the ashes were given to his family . 
 = = Posthumous releases = = 
 Sixteen days after his death , Wallace 's double @-@ disc second album was released as planned with the shortened title of Life After Death and hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 charts , after making a premature appearance at No. 176 due to street @-@ date violations . The record album featured a much wider range of guests and producers than its predecessor . It gained strong reviews and in 2000 was certified Diamond , the highest RIAA certification awarded to a solo hip hop album . 
 Its lead single , " Hypnotize " , was the last music video recording in which Wallace would participate . His biggest chart success was with its follow @-@ up " Mo Money Mo Problems " , featuring Sean Combs ( under the rap alias " Puff Daddy " ) and Mase . Both singles reached No. 1 in the Hot 100 , making Wallace the first artist to achieve this feat posthumously . The third single , " Sky 's The Limit " , featuring the band 112 , was noted for its use of children in the music video , directed by Spike Jonze , who were used to portray Wallace and his contemporaries , including Sean Combs , Lil ' Kim , and Busta Rhymes . Wallace was named Artist of the Year and " Hypnotize " Single of the Year by Spin magazine in December 1997 . 
 In mid @-@ 1997 , Combs released his debut album , No Way Out , which featured Wallace on five songs , notably on the third single " Victory " . The most prominent single from the record album was " I 'll Be Missing You " , featuring Combs , Faith Evans and 112 , which was dedicated to Wallace 's memory . At the 1998 Grammy Awards , Life After Death and its first two singles received nominations in the rap category . The album award was won by Combs ' No Way Out and " I 'll Be Missing You " won the award in the category of Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group in which " Mo Money Mo Problems " was nominated . 
 Wallace had founded a hip hop supergroup called The Commission , which consisted of Jay @-@ Z , Lil ' Cease , Combs , Charli Baltimore and himself . The Commission was mentioned by Wallace in the lyrics of " What 's Beef " on Life After Death and " Victory " from No Way Out but never completed an album . A song on Duets : The Final Chapter titled " <unk> Want ( The Commission ) " featuring Jay @-@ Z was based on the group . 
 In December 1999 , Bad Boy released Born Again . The album consisted of previously unreleased material mixed with guest appearances including many artists Wallace had never collaborated with in his lifetime . It gained some positive reviews but received criticism for its unlikely pairings ; The Source describing it as " compiling some of the most awkward collaborations of his career " . Nevertheless , the album sold 2 million copies . Wallace appeared on Michael Jackson 's 2001 album , Invincible . Over the course of time , his vocals were heard on hit songs such as " Foolish " by Ashanti and " <unk> Niggas " in 2002 , and the song " Runnin ' ( Dying to Live ) " with Shakur the following year . In 2005 , Duets : The Final Chapter continued the pattern started on Born Again , criticized for the lack of significant vocals by Wallace on some of its songs . Its lead single " Nasty Girl " became Wallace 's first UK No. 1 single . Combs and Voletta Wallace have stated the album will be the last release primarily featuring new material . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Wallace mostly rapped on his songs in a deep tone described by Rolling Stone as a " thick , jaunty grumble " , which went deeper on Life After Death . He was often accompanied on songs with ad libs from Sean " Puffy " Combs . On The Source 's Unsigned Hype , his style was described as " cool , nasal , and filtered , to bless his own material " . 
 Allmusic describe Wallace as having " a talent for piling multiple rhymes on top of one another in quick succession " . Time magazine wrote Wallace rapped with an ability to " make multi @-@ syllabic rhymes sound ... smooth " , while <unk> describes Wallace 's rhythmic style as " effusive . " Before starting a verse , Wallace sometimes used onomatopoeic vocables to " warm up " ( for example " <unk> " at the beginning of " Hypnotize " and " Big Poppa " and " <unk> " after certain rhymes in songs such as " My Downfall " ) . 
 Lateef of <unk> notes that Wallace had , " intense and complex flows " , <unk> Starr of Onyx says , " Biggie was a master of the flow " , and Bishop Lamont states that Wallace mastered " all the hemispheres of the music " . " Notorious B.I.G. also often used the single @-@ line rhyme scheme to add variety and interest to his flow " . Big Daddy Kane suggests that Wallace didn 't need a large vocabulary to impress listeners – " he just put his words together a slick way and it worked real good for him " . Wallace was known to compose lyrics in his head , rather than write them down on paper , in a similar way to Jay @-@ Z. 
 Wallace would occasionally vary from his usual style . On " Playa Hater " from his second album , he sang in a slow @-@ falsetto . On his collaboration with Bone Thugs @-@ n @-@ Harmony , " Notorious Thugs " , he modified his style to match the rapid rhyme flow of the group . 
 = = = Themes and lyrical content = = = 
 Wallace 's lyrical topics and themes included mafioso tales ( " Niggas Bleed " ) , his drug dealing past ( " 10 Crack Commandments " ) , materialistic bragging ( " Hypnotize " ) , as well as humor ( " Just Playing ( Dreams ) " ) , and romance ( " Me & My Bitch " ) . Rolling Stone named Wallace in 2004 as " one of the few young male songwriters in any pop style writing credible love songs " . 
 Guerilla Black , in the book How to Rap , describes how Wallace was able to both " glorify the upper echelon " and " [ make ] you feel his struggle " . According to Touré of The New York Times in 1994 , Wallace 's lyrics " [ mixed ] autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty " . Marriott of The New York Times ( in 1997 ) believed his lyrics were not strictly autobiographical and wrote he " had a knack for exaggeration that increased sales " . Wallace described his debut as " a big pie , with each slice indicating a different point in my life involving bitches and niggaz ... from the beginning to the end " . 
 Ready to Die is described by Rolling Stone as a contrast of " bleak " street visions and being " full of high @-@ spirited fun , bringing the pleasure principle back to hip @-@ hop " .

 Allmusic wrote that the success of Ready to Die is " mostly due to Wallace 's skill as a storyteller " ; in 1994 , Rolling Stone described Wallace 's ability in this technique as painting " a sonic picture so vibrant that you 're transported right to the scene " . On Life After Death Wallace notably demonstrated this skill on " I Got a Story to Tell " , creating a story as a rap for the first half of the song and then retelling the same story " for his boys " in conversation form .

 = The Ring ( South Park ) = 
 " The Ring " is the thirteenth season premiere of the American animated television series South Park . The 182nd overall episode of the series , it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 11 , 2009 . In the episode , Kenny and his new girlfriend are encouraged by the Jonas Brothers to wear purity rings , which is secretly a marketing tactic by Disney to sell sex to young girls . 
 The episode was written and directed by series co @-@ founder Trey Parker and is rated TV @-@ MA L in the United States . It was the first South Park episode to premiere in 16 : 9 and high definition . Parker and Stone were not very familiar with the Jonas Brothers before they wrote " The Ring " , which was inspired by the recent release of Jonas Brothers : The 3D Concert Experience . The two argued over whether to open the season with this episode or an episode focusing on the economic recession ( " Margaritaville " ) , but eventually decided they needed more time to craft a script for the latter . 
 " The Ring " portrays Disney as a corporation using the ruse of family @-@ friendly morals to disguise their primary motive of profit , particularly through the portrayal of Mickey Mouse as a foul @-@ mouthed , greedy , and physically violent company president . The episode received generally positive reviews and , according to Nielsen Media Research , was seen by 3 @.@ 41 million viewers the week it was broadcast . The publicist for the Jonas Brothers specifically forbade reporters from asking the band about the episode ; although Nick Jonas said they did not watch it , he did say it was an honor to be included in the show . " The Ring " was released on DVD and Blu @-@ ray along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16 , 2010 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 To the amazement of all the other boys , Kenny has a girlfriend , fifth grader Tammy Warner . Butters hears a rumor that Tammy is a slut because she gave another male student a " B.J. " in a T.G.I. Friday 's parking lot , so Stan , Kyle , and Cartman , hoping to spare Kenny 's feelings , decide to warn him . To their bewilderment , Kenny 's reaction is excitement and happiness . Kenny invites Tammy to go with him to T.G.I. Friday 's after school , at which point she confesses that the rumor about her is true , but , not noticing his delight , explains that the only reason she did it was because she became aroused after watching the Jonas Brothers perform . Consequently , Kenny , hoping she will give him a " B.J. " as well , takes Tammy to a Jonas Brothers concert at the Pepsi Center , with his friends disgusted by his intent ; Cartman claims that " the most bacteria @-@ ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman . " 
 After the concert , Tammy and several other girls are invited backstage , where they think the Jonas Brothers want to have sex with them . Instead , they convince girls to wear purity rings as a pledge to abstinence and tell them to get all of their friends to start wearing them as well because " That is just the way we roll " which is a reference to one of their songs . To appease his girlfriend , Kenny reluctantly begins wearing a purity ring . As Kenny becomes dull as a result and ceases to spend time with his friends , it is revealed that the Jonas Brothers are being forced to wear and promote purity rings by their boss , a fearsome , greedy , sadistic , and foul @-@ mouthed Mickey Mouse , who verbally berates and violently beats them when they complain that the rings are overshadowing their music and projecting the wrong message . Mickey explains that the rings allow him to sell sexual stimulation to young girls while giving the false appearance of innocence and purity . Concerned for their friend , Stan , Kyle , and Cartman attempt to confront the Jonas Brothers at a televised appearance in Denver , but Mickey , mistaking the boys for secret agents hired by DreamWorks ( or Michael Eisner ) to sabotage the televised appearance , tranquilizes them and takes them prisoner . 
 When the boys regain consciousness , they are backstage at the Jonas Brothers ' 3D concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre . Mickey interrogates them and eventually threatens them with a chainsaw , refusing to believe they are not working for another company . As Mickey once again rants about his true intentions , this time insulting the Jonas Brothers ' fans and Christians , Kyle stealthily turns on the microphone and Cartman raises the curtain , broadcasting Mickey 's rant to both the concert @-@ goers and the national television audience . The crowd turns on Mickey and the Jonas Brothers leave the stage in a huff . An enraged Mickey inflates to an enormous size and begins spitting fire and destroying Denver . Tammy and Kenny remove their purity rings , and Tammy suggests they go to T.G.I. Friday 's . The show immediately cuts to Kenny 's funeral , where the audience learns that he contracted syphilis after receiving a <unk> from his girlfriend Tammy Warner and died .

 " The Ring " was written and directed by series co @-@ founder Trey Parker . It was first broadcast on March 11 , 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central , and then aired two days later on satellite Paramount Comedy in the United Kingdom . It was the first episode of South Park 's thirteenth season and the first episode to be broadcast in high @-@ definition ( HD ) . Parker and Stone argued over whether to start the season with a Jonas Brothers episode or a show about the economic recession , which they had been planning to do for some time . Stone argued they should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time , but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script , and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener . Stone ultimately agreed , and later admitted it was the right decision . An episode about the economy entitled " Margaritaville " was shown later in the season . By March 8 , three days before the episode premiered , the script was only half @-@ finished and the animation was not yet complete , in keeping with the practice of show creators Parker and Matt Stone to finish episodes upon last @-@ minute deadlines ; Stone said of the practice , " We don 't do a live show , but we kind of harness some of that energy . We kind of need that to work . We 're , like , ' We have to do something right now . It 's going on the air in just a few minutes . ' " 
 The Jonas Brothers characters were voiced by Parker and Stone , with Parker providing the voices for Kevin and Nick , and Stone voicing Joe , although the two switched characters on some lines . Parker also provides the voice of Mickey Mouse in " The Ring " . Parker and Stone were inspired to make the episode by the Jonas Brothers : The 3D Concert Experience film , which was released the previous month . Because they were unfamiliar with the band , they spent a large amount of time watching Jonas Brothers concert clips online , which they found unoriginal and not very enjoyable . Parker said one of the Comedy Central employees told them that after she took her young daughter to see the concert film , the girl said , " Mommy , my giney tickles " . Parker thought the story was hilarious and worked the exact line into the episode . 
 = = Theme = = 
 Reviewers and commentators have described " The Ring " as not just a parody of the Jonas Brothers and their songs ( The songs parodied include " S.O.S " and " Burnin ' Up " ) , but also of the ethos of the Walt Disney Company . The episode portrays Disney as a corporation using the ruse of family @-@ friendly morals to disguise their primary motive of profit ; reviewers and articles said this point is further illustrated by the use of Mickey Mouse , a cartoon symbol for the wholesome Disney image , as a foul @-@ mouthed , contemptuous , greedy , all @-@ powerful and violent character . Specifically , the episode targets Disney 's marketing tactic of the band members pledging abstinence through purity rings , which the script suggests is used to subliminally sell sex to young girls , while simultaneously appeasing the ethical standards of their parents and taking advantage of their fearful desire to protect their daughters , as Mickey had said . Parker and Stone said after watching footage of the Jonas Brothers , he found their embracing of purity rings particularly fascinating , especially since they were simultaneously stirring sexual feelings in young girls . 
 The episode further illustrates the greed of corporate culture by portraying Mickey as capitalizing on religion for profit , while secretly mocking it in a particularly cruel tone : " I 've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now ! And do you know why ? Because Christians are retarded ! They believe in a talking dead guy ! " " The Ring " ends with a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek cautionary message against engaging in oral sex , depicting Kenny 's death from a sexually transmitted disease in the final moments of the episode . When asked whether Stone really believed purity rings were " lame " , as they were portrayed in " The Ring " , he said , " Well , I don 't know . I didn 't have one in high school , and I was still lame . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The Jonas Brothers are parodied in " The Ring " and play a prominent role in the episode 's plot . In a television column written before " The Ring " was broadcast , Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post suggested Parker and Stone were using the Jonas Brothers in the thirteenth season debut as a means of improving the show 's ratings ; Comedy Central executives insisted Jonas Brothers fans do not fit into South Park 's demographic of males between the ages 18 and 49 . The scenes with the Jonas Brothers using hoses to shoot foam into the faces of their female fans were inspired by actual scenes in Jonas Brothers : The 3D Concert Experience . Matt Stone said some viewers found it so unusual they believed the writers made it up themselves . The Walt Disney Company , the Disney Channel and the Mickey Mouse cartoon character are also prominently featured , and spoofed , in the episode ; even when Mickey Mouse says callous things or physically assaults people , he follows up most sentences with the character 's trademark high @-@ pitched " Ha @-@ ha ! " laugh , which in context comes off like a nervous tic . 
 The show Grey 's Anatomy is mocked in " The Ring " ; Kenny and Tammy , and the other characters who wear purity rings , develop a strong affinity for the show as they become more boring . ( Incidentally several actors and actresses connected to Disney have appeared in the Disney @-@ produced Grey 's Anatomy , broadcast on a Disney @-@ owned network . ) Those characters also frequently watch movies from Netflix , the popular online DVD rental service ; the company is referenced in one of the episode 's semi @-@ parodies of a Jonas Brothers song " I 've Got a Ring " ( which parodies " SOS " ) : " Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we can cook a meal and sit around and watch Netflix ? " T.G.I. Friday 's , a real @-@ life American restaurant chain , is referenced several times as the place where Tammy gave her ex @-@ boyfriend a <unk> . A can of Dr. Pepper appears repeatedly in the South Park Elementary cafeteria ; David <unk> of The Philadelphia Inquirer said of the product placement , " I never thought I 'd see this type of crass commercialism turn up on South Park , which may be the most brazenly iconoclastic show TV has ever seen . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original American broadcast , " The Ring " was watched by 3 @.@ 41 million viewers , according to the Nielsen Media Research , making it the second most @-@ watched Comedy Central production of the week , behind the Comedy Central Roast of Larry the Cable Guy , which was seen by 4 @.@ 08 million viewers . " The Ring " outperformed the March 11 and 12 episodes of The Daily Show , which received wide media coverage due to an ongoing feud between Daily Show host Jon Stewart and CNBC pundit Jim Cramer , who was a guest in the latter episode . 
 The thirteenth season premiere received generally positive reviews . Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker gave the episode a positive review , showing approval of Kenny 's misadventure , saying " thus did South Park ultimately come down on the side of religion and sexual freedom , with lots of big laughs in the bargain .... Trey and Matt are off to a great 13th @-@ season start . " James Poniewozik of Time said " The Ring " was better than any of the twelfth season episodes . Poniewozik said the episode , " demonstrated that the cartoon is best when it focuses on the four kids and when it is driven by a white @-@ hot moral fury " . Travis Fickett of IGN also particularly applauded the Disney satire , which he said , " elevates this beyond shock humor and into sharp satire . " IGN gave the episode an 8 @.@ 4 score out of 10 . 
 Brad Trechak of TV Squad called " The Ring " a highlight of the season . Josh Modell of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- grade , although he said it tended to become " heavy @-@ handed " with its moral near the end . Modell said he particularly liked the reactions from the young girls at the Jonas Brothers concert , Kenny 's enthusiastic response to his girlfriend 's promiscuity and the line from the Jimmy <unk> character : " If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore , I 'd want you to tell me . " In its list of top television moments for the week , TV Guide listed as number seven a line of dialogue from " The Ring " spoken by Butters : " A ring that says you 'll be together but not have sex . Isn 't that called a wedding ring ? " 
 Sonny Bunch of The Washington Times said , " The episode was both funny and smart , a wry commentary on the inherent <unk> of marketing a rebellious art form infused with sexuality to children who have no business being sexually active themselves . " Tamar Anitai , a blogger for MTV , said the episode was " hilarious " . He said " The South Park writers actually appeared to sympathize , if not side with , the Jonas Brothers ... In the end , Disney and Christianity ended up getting a far more severe skewering than the Jonas Brothers . " Alan Sepinwall , television writer for The Star @-@ Ledger , said he thought the Mickey Mouse character was used as an effective satirical device for corporate greed , but said he was not particularly impressed with the overall episode because " its targets — the Jonas Brothers , and the Disney company for using them to sell sex to little girls with impunity — were so easy to hit " . In contrast , Parents Television Council ( PTC ) , criticized the episode for such elements , and they named this episode the " Worst Cable Content of the Week " . 
 According to a news report by Canwest News Service , the Jonas Brothers ' publicist specifically forbade reporters from asking the band members about the South Park episode . Nick Jonas told the Orlando Sentinel that the band had not seen the episode : " We are always open to make fun of ourselves . For us , we 're so focused on what we 're doing with this tour and our album , we didn 't have much time to see it . " 
 In a 2016 AMA on Reddit , Nick Jonas reflected on the episode . " When it first came out I didn 't think it was funny to be honest , but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time , so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on , " he said . " But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around , it was very funny to me and I 've actually watched the episode a few times . "

 Shantae is a series of platform video games developed by WayForward Technologies , with the first title having originally been distributed by Capcom . The main character of the series , a half @-@ genie named Shantae , was created by Erin Bozon , while the games themselves were created from this character by her husband Matt Bozon . The series currently consists of three games : Shantae ( 2002 ) , Shantae : Risky 's Revenge ( 2010 ) and Shantae and the Pirate 's Curse ( 2014 ) . A future Shantae game , Shantae : Half @-@ Genie Hero , was announced in September 2013 with plans to be released winter 2016 . 
 Set in the fictional world of Sequin Land , the series follows Shantae as she tries to protect her hometown Scuttle Town , and more generally Sequin Land as a whole , from various threats , which generally involve to some extent her nemesis , the lady pirate Risky Boots . The setting , despite various fantasy , dark fantasy and steampunk elements , mostly displays oriental @-@ inspired esthetics . All games involve collecting new powers and items , which vary from game to game , to strengthen Shantae and unlock access to new areas . 
 Although releasing to strong reviews , the first game sunk into obscurity , its poor sales generally being attributed to its late release on the Game Boy Color , which at the time had already been replaced by the Game Boy Advance . After several years in the vault , the series resurfaced in 2010 with Risky 's Revenge , and has since enjoyed more commercial success and a growth in popularity . The entire series has always met with constant critical support , and is considered the flagship series of WayForward Technologies and sometimes the American indie video gaming scene as a whole . 
 = = History = = 
 The character of Shantae was created by Erin Bell , the future wife of Matt Bozon , the game 's creator . In 1994 , while both were engaged , Erin got a flash of inspiration while coming back from her camp counsellor days , and created the character , naming her " Shantae " after one of the campers , as well as developed her dancing abilities . Matt later asked her what she would come up with if she was to create a video game character , and she introduced him to Shantae . Matt liked the idea and fleshed out the mythology and cast of the game . Erin also imagined that the character could summon or charm animals by belly @-@ dancing . This would later become the basis for the transformation dances . Matt has provided two contradictory stories about how the idea for the hair whip came to be ; in one , he said he was inspired by the nine @-@ foot @-@ long hair of his future wife , while in the other he claims that Erin 's sketches already featured Shantae using her hair as a weapon when she showed him the original concept . 
 Matt Bozon has stated that his main influences for the game series are Castlevania , Aladdin , Mega Man , The Legend of Zelda and anime , mostly Ranma ½ which he claims as a heavy influence , and others like Nadia : The Secret of Blue Water , Hayao Miyazaki 's films , and G1 Pokémon , as well as 80s cartoons like <unk> or The Transformers , while Erin Bozon 's main influence was I Dream of Jeannie . The signature catchphrase from the franchise , " Ret @-@ 2 @-@ Go " , was created by a friend of them who kept using it when they were working on animation clean up for the Warner Bros. animated film The Iron Giant , and the expression made its way into the script as an inside joke . Matt also elaborated a bit on the development of Sky 's character , who was initially named " Twitch " and had a different appearance . She was altered later on in development , and the original Twitch character served as the basis for a similarly @-@ named character and her friend in Shantae and the Pirate 's Curse . 
 When asked about whether the Shantae series was conceived as pushing feminist values because of its strong female cast , Matt Bozon acknowledged that he liked to portray the Shantae world as having the girls " run the show " and not be defined solely by their appearances . While he admitted that the female characters near @-@ universally had a deliberately sexy design to them , and the male characters often displayed a variety of weaknesses , he also said that he just liked depicting Shantae 's world this way " for no precise reason " , and that it was certainly possible that strong male characters could appear later in the franchise 's future .

 Plans for a sequel to Shantae started soon after its release . Shantae Advance , also known as Shantae 2 : Risky Revolution , was a sequel that was in development for the Game Boy Advance , but was canceled after not being picked up by a publisher . A demo of the first world was developed , and while not released to the public , WayForward streamed a full playthrough of it on October 3 , 2013 , as part of a promotion for the crowdfunding of Half @-@ Genie Hero . 
 Shantae Advance was planned to consist of eight chapters of gameplay split over seven towns , six islands , and six labyrinths ; this was estimated to take about twenty hours to play through . In addition to the regular gameplay , six minigames and a multiplayer battle mode were planned . Four of the labyrinths were supposed to be based on the four seasons ; the first labyrinth , which was featured in the demo , was based on autumn , and its hub room was filled with falling autumn leaves . The story of Shantae Advance involved Risky having her <unk> dig under Sequin Land , and putting a pillar in the middle , allowing the land to be rotated . This could be used in the gameplay to rotate the world , lining up the foreground with objects in the background , thus giving the player access to new areas . 
 New gameplay elements for Shantae Advance included the ability to move between the foreground and background , swimming , flying in 3D on the back of Sky 's bird Wrench , and some new forms for Shantae to transform into ; these included a new version of the spider , a crab , and a mermaid ; the first two are under consideration to be brought back for Shantae : Half @-@ Genie Hero , and the latter was brought back in Risky 's Revenge . As with the original game , Shantae Advance was developed by Matt Bozon on his own time .

 Another attempt at a Shantae sequel was Shantae : Risky Waters , a game planned for the Nintendo DS with experimental gameplay taking advantage of the double screen function of the console . Plans were scrapped after WayForward failed to find a publisher as well . 
 = Time on Earth = 
 Time on Earth is the fifth studio album by the pop @-@ rock band Crowded House . Tracks have been produced by both Ethan Johns and Steve Lillywhite and the album was released on 30 June 2007 in Australia , 2 July in the United Kingdom and 10 July in North America . Time on Earth is the band 's first studio album since 1993 , and marks the reunion of the band eleven years after they disbanded and features new drummer Matt Sherrod in place of the original drummer , Paul Hester , who took his own life in 2005 . 
 As the first studio album from the group in fourteen years , Time on Earth has been subject to much speculation . Upon its release the album garnered positive critical reception and reached Platinum status within weeks of release in Australia , and Gold status in its second week of release in New Zealand . To promote the album , the group toured internationally , beginning by performing at Coachella music festival and at Live Earth in July . For further promotion , three singles were released from the album , " Don 't Stop Now " , " She Called Up " and " Pour Le Monde " , and a special tour edition of the album was released in Australia in November 2007 featuring an extra CD with eleven songs from a concert from the album 's North American tour .

 The album was originally intended to be frontman Neil Finn 's third solo release . In the wake of Paul Hester 's death , as well as preparations for the release of the live album Farewell to the World , the band members were drawn together and their friendship was reinvigorated . In 2006 , Neil Finn invited bassist Nick Seymour to participate in the recording of his new album and subsequent tour . In the initial phase , various session musicians filled parts , such as studio musician Joey Waronker on drums and British soul singer Beth Rowley provided backup vocals for the song " Transit Lounge . " After recording a complete album with Ethan Johns in the producer and drummer 's seat and Seymour contributing substantially throughout the process , Finn decided Crowded House would reform and that Time on Earth would be the band 's fifth studio album . The title Time on Earth takes its name from a song of the same name that was not included in the album . 
 With new drummer Matt Sherrod and returning multi @-@ instrumentalist Mark Hart now involved as members of the official line @-@ up , the band returned to the studio to record four additional tracks with producer Steve Lillywhite . Hart and Sherrod also contributed retroactively to some of the material produced by Ethan Johns . In its final form , the album features tracks mixed by Johns , Lillywhite and Tchad Blake . Guitarist Johnny Marr was involved in the recording of " Even a Child " , which he co @-@ wrote , and " Don 't Stop Now " . 
 = = = Recording and production = = = 
 Due to the transient nature of the album , gradually adapting from a solo venture into a band effort , the recording process used was somewhat unorthodox in that it encompassed various session musicians for the majority , while the " central line @-@ up " of Finn , Seymour , Hart and Sherrod only performed on four tracks , which includes " Don 't Stop Now " , the album 's lead single , and " She Called Up " , the following single . Before this point , most of the album was produced by Ethan Johns ; however , from enlisting Sherrod and calling upon Hart to return , the prolific producer Steve Lillywhite took over .
