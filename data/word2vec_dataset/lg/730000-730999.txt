 In the late 1820s Balzac dabbled in several business ventures , a penchant his sister blamed on the temptation of an unknown neighbour . His first enterprise was in publishing which turned out cheap one @-@ volume editions of French classics including the works of Molière . This business failed miserably , with many of the books " sold as waste paper " . Balzac had better luck publishing the Memoirs of the Duchess of <unk> , with whom he also had a love affair . 
 Balzac borrowed money from his family and friends , and tried to build a printing business , then a typefounder enterprise . His inexperience and lack of capital caused his ruin in these trades . He gave the businesses to a friend ( who made them successful ) but carried the debts for many years . As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50 @,@ 000 francs to his mother . 
 Balzac never lost his penchant for une bonne <unk> . It resurfaced painfully later when — as a renowned and busy author — he traveled to Sardinia in the hopes of reprocessing the slag from the Roman mines there . Near the end of his life Balzac was captivated by the idea of cutting 20 @,@ 000 acres ( 81 km2 ) of oak wood in Ukraine and transporting it for sale in France . 
 = = = La Comédie Humaine and literary success = = = 
 After writing several novels , in 1832 Balzac conceived the idea for an enormous series of books that would paint a panoramic portrait of " all aspects of society " . The moment the idea came to him , Balzac raced to his sister 's apartment and proclaimed : " I am about to become a genius " ! Although he originally called it Etudes des Mœurs ( Study of Mores ) , it eventually became known as La Comédie Humaine , and he included in it all the fiction that he had published in his lifetime under his own name . This was to be Balzac 's life work and his greatest achievement . 
 After the collapse of his businesses , Balzac traveled to Brittany and stayed with the De Pommereul family outside Fougères . There he drew inspiration for Les Chouans ( 1829 ) , a tale of love gone wrong amid the Chouan royalist forces . Although Balzac was a supporter of the Crown , Balzac paints the counter @-@ revolutionaries in a sympathetic light — even though they are the center of the book 's most brutal scenes . This was the first book Balzac released under his own name , and it gave him what one critic called " passage into the Promised Land " . It established him as an author of note ( even if its historical fiction @-@ genre imitates that of Sir Walter Scott ) and provided him with a name outside his past pseudonyms . 
 Soon afterwards , around the time of his father 's death , Balzac wrote El Verdugo — about a 30 @-@ year @-@ old man who kills his father ( Balzac was 30 years old at the time ) . This was the first work signed " Honoré de Balzac " . He followed his father in the surname Balzac but added the aristocratic @-@ sounding nobiliary particle to help him fit into respected society , a choice based on skill rather than by right . " The aristocracy and authority of talent are more substantial than the aristocracy of names and material power " , he wrote in 1830 . The timing of the decision was also significant ; as Robb explained : " The disappearance of the father coincides with the adoption of the nobiliary particle . A symbolic inheritance . " Just as his father had worked his way up from poverty into respectable society , Balzac considered toil and effort his real mark of nobility . 
 When the July Revolution overthrew Charles X in 1830 , Balzac declared himself a Legitimist , supporting King Charles ' Royal House of Bourbon , but not without qualifications . He felt that the new July Monarchy ( which claimed widespread popular support ) was disorganized and unprincipled , in need of a mediator to keep the political peace between the King and insurgent forces . He called for " a young and vigorous man who belongs neither to the Directoire nor to the Empire , but who is 1830 incarnate .... " He planned to be such a candidate , appealing especially to the higher classes in Chinon . But after a near @-@ fatal accident in 1832 ( he slipped and cracked his head on the street ) , Balzac decided not to stand for election . 
 1831 saw the success of La Peau de chagrin ( The Wild Ass 's Skin or The Magic Skin ) , a fable @-@ like tale about a despondent young man named Raphaël de Valentin who finds an animal skin which promises great power and wealth . He obtains these things , but loses the ability to manage them . In the end , his health fails and he is consumed by his own confusion . Balzac meant the story to bear witness to the treacherous turns of life , its " serpentine motion " . 
 In 1833 Balzac released Eugénie Grandet , his first best @-@ seller . The tale of a young lady who inherits her father 's miserliness , it also became the most critically acclaimed book of his career . The writing is simple , yet the individuals ( especially the bourgeois title character ) are dynamic and complex . 
 Le Père Goriot ( Old Father Goriot , 1835 ) was his next success , in which Balzac transposes the story of King Lear to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money . The centrality of a father in this novel matches Balzac 's own position — not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary , Jules <unk> , but also the fact that he had fathered a child , Marie @-@ Caroline Du Fresnay , with his otherwise @-@ married lover , Maria Du Fresnay , who had been his source of inspiration for Eugénie Grandet . 
 In 1836 Balzac took the helm of the Chronique de Paris , a weekly magazine of society and politics . He tried to enforce strict impartiality in its pages and a reasoned assessment of various ideologies . As Rogers notes , " Balzac was interested in any social , political , or economic theory , whether from the right or the left . " The magazine failed , but in July 1840 he founded another publication , the Revue Parisienne . It produced three issues . 
 These dismal business efforts — and his misadventures in Sardinia — provided an appropriate milieu in which to set the two @-@ volume Illusions perdues ( Lost Illusions , 1843 ) . The novel concerns Lucien de Rubempré , a young poet trying to make a name for himself , who becomes trapped in the morass of society 's darkest contradictions . Lucien 's journalistic work is informed by Balzac 's own failed ventures in the field . <unk> et <unk> des <unk> ( The Harlot High and Low , 1847 ) continues Lucien 's story . He is trapped by the Abbé Herrera ( Vautrin ) in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status . The book undergoes a massive temporal rift ; the first part ( of four ) covers a span of six years , while the final two sections focus on just three days . 
 Le Cousin Pons ( 1847 ) and La Cousine Bette ( 1848 ) tell the story of Les Parents <unk> ( The Poor Relations ) . The conniving and wrangling over wills and inheritances reflect the expertise gained by the author as a young law clerk . Balzac 's health was deteriorating by this point , making the completion of this pair of books a significant accomplishment . 
 Many of his novels were initially serialized , like those of Dickens . Their length was not predetermined . Illusions Perdues extends to a thousand pages after starting inauspiciously in a small @-@ town print shop , whereas La Fille aux yeux d 'or ( The Girl with the Golden Eyes , 1835 ) opens with a broad panorama of Paris but becomes a closely plotted novella of only fifty pages . 
 = = = Work habits = = = 
 Balzac 's work habits are legendary — he did not work quickly , but toiled with an incredible focus and dedication . His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon , then sleep until midnight . He then rose and wrote for many hours , fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee . He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch ; he claimed to have once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle . 
 Balzac revised obsessively , covering printer 's proofs with changes and additions to be reset . He sometimes repeated this process during the publication of a book , causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher . As a result , the finished product quite often was different from the original text . Although some of his books never reached completion , some — such as Les <unk> ( The Government Clerks , 1841 ) — are nonetheless noted by critics . 
 Although Balzac was " by turns a hermit and a vagrant " , he managed to stay in tune with the social spheres which nourished his writing . He was friends with Théophile Gautier and Pierre @-@ Marie @-@ Charles de Bernard du Grail de la Villette , and he was acquainted with Victor Hugo . Nevertheless , he did not spend as much time in salons and clubs of Paris like many of his characters . " In the first place he was too busy " , explains Saintsbury , " in the second he would not have been at home there .... [ H ] e felt it was his business not to frequent society but to create it " . However he often spent long periods at the Château de Saché , near Tours , the home of his friend Jean de <unk> , his mother 's lover and father to her youngest child . Many of Balzac 's tormented characters were conceived in the chateau 's small second @-@ floor bedroom . Today the chateau is a museum dedicated to the author 's life . 
 = = = Marriage and sentimental life = = = 
 In 1833 , as he revealed in a letter to his sister , Balzac entered into an illicit affair with fellow writer Maria Du Fresnay , who was then aged 24 . Her marriage to a considerably older man ( Charles du Fresnay , Mayor of Sartrouville ) had been a failure from the outset . In this letter , Balzac also reveals that the young woman had just come to tell him she was pregnant with his child . In 1834 , 8 months after the event , Maria Du Fresnay 's daughter by Balzac , Marie @-@ Caroline Du Fresnay , was born . This revelation from French journalist Roger Pierrot in 1955 confirmed what was already suspected by several historians : the dedicatee of the novel Eugénie Grandet , a certain " Maria " , turns out to be Maria Du Fresnay herself . 
 In February 1832 Balzac received an intriguing letter from Odessa — with no return address and signed simply " L 'Étrangère " ( " The Foreigner " ) — expressing sadness at the cynicism and atheism in La Peau de Chagrin and its negative portrayal of women . His response was to place a classified advertisement in the Gazette de France , hoping that his anonymous critic would see it . Thus began a fifteen @-@ year correspondence between Balzac and " the object of [ his ] sweetest dreams " : Ewelina Hańska . 
 Ewelina ( née Rzewuska ) was married to a nobleman twenty years her senior , Marshal Wacław Hański , a wealthy Polish landowner living near Kiev . It had been a marriage of convenience to preserve her family 's fortune . In Balzac Countess Ewelina found a kindred spirit for her emotional and social desires , with the added benefit of feeling a connection to the glamorous capital of France . Their correspondence reveals an intriguing balance of passion , propriety and patience ; Robb says it is " like an experimental novel in which the female protagonist is always trying to pull in extraneous realities but which the hero is determined to keep on course , whatever tricks he has to use " . 
 Marshal Hański died in 1841 , and his widow and her admirer finally had the chance to pursue their affections . A rival of the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt , Balzac visited Countess Hańska in St. Petersburg in 1843 and won her heart . After a series of financial setbacks , health problems and objections from Tsar Nicholas I , the couple finally received permission to wed . On 14 March 1850 , with Balzac 's health in serious decline , they travelled by carriage from her family seat at <unk> Park in Volhynia to St. Barbara 's Catholic Church in Berdychiv ( Russia 's former banking city in present @-@ day Ukraine ) , where they were married by Abbot <unk> . The ten @-@ hour journey to and from the ceremony took a toll on both husband and wife : her feet were too swollen to walk , and he endured severe heart trouble . 
 Although he married late in life , Balzac had already written two treatises on marriage : Physiologie du Mariage and Scènes de la Vie <unk> . These works lacked firsthand knowledge ; Saintsbury points out that " <unk> cannot talk of [ marriage ] with much authority " . In late April the newly @-@ weds set off for Paris . His health deteriorated on the way , and Ewelina wrote to her daughter about Balzac being " in a state of extreme weakness " and " sweating profusely " . They arrived in the French capital on 20 May , his fifty @-@ first birthday . 
 Five months after his wedding , on Sunday , 18 August 1850 , Balzac died . His mother was the only one with him when he expired ; Eve de Balzac ( formerly Countess Hańska ) had gone to bed . He had been visited that day by Victor Hugo , who later served as a pallbearer and the <unk> at Balzac 's funeral . 
 Balzac is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris . At his memorial service , Victor Hugo pronounced " Today we have people in black because of the death of the man of talent ; a nation in mourning for a man of genius " . The funeral was attended by " almost every writer in Paris " , including Frédérick Lemaître , Gustave Courbet , Dumas père and Dumas fils , as well as representatives of the Légion d 'honneur and other dignitaries . 
 Later , a statue ( called the Monument à Balzac ) was created by the celebrated French sculptor Auguste Rodin . Cast in bronze , the Balzac Monument has stood since 1939 nearby the intersection of Boulevard Raspail and Boulevard Montparnasse at Place Pablo @-@ Picasso . Rodin featured Balzac in several of his smaller sculptures as well . 
 = = Writing style = = 
 The Comédie Humaine remained unfinished at the time of his death — Balzac had plans to include numerous other books , most of which he never started . He frequently <unk> between works in progress , and " finished articles " were frequently revised between editions . This piecemeal style is reflective of the author 's own life , a possible attempt to stabilize it through fiction . " The vanishing man " , wrote Sir Victor Pritchett , " who must be pursued from the rue Cassini to ... Versailles , Ville d 'Avray , Italy , and Vienna can construct a settled dwelling only in his work " . 
 = = = Realism = = = 
 Balzac 's extensive use of detail , especially the detail of objects , to illustrate the lives of his characters made him an early pioneer of literary realism . While he admired and drew inspiration from the Romantic style of Scottish novelist Walter Scott , Balzac sought to depict human existence through the use of particulars . In the preface to the first edition of Scènes de la Vie privée , he wrote : " the author firmly believes that details alone will henceforth determine the merit of works " . Plentiful descriptions of décor , clothing , and possessions help breathe life into the characters . For example , Balzac 's friend Henri de Latouche had a good knowledge of hanging wallpaper . Balzac transferred this to his descriptions of the Pension Vauquer in Le Père Goriot , making the wallpaper speak of the identities of those living inside . 
 Some critics consider Balzac 's writing exemplary of naturalism — a more pessimistic and analytical form of realism , which seeks to explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment . French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac the father of the naturalist novel . Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens , the naturalist sees through a clear glass — precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works . 
 = = = = Characters = = = = 
 Balzac sought to present his characters as real people , neither fully good nor fully evil , but completely human . " To arrive at the truth " , he wrote in the preface to Le Lys dans la <unk> , " writers use whatever literary device seems capable of giving the greatest intensity of life to their characters " . " Balzac 's characters " , Robb notes , " were as real to him as if he were observing them in the outside world " . This reality was noted by playwright Oscar Wilde , who said : " One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of [ Illusions Perdues protagonist ] Lucien de Rubempré .... It haunts me in my moments of pleasure . I remember it when I laugh " . 
 At the same time , the characters depict a particular range of social types : the noble soldier , the scoundrel , the proud workman , the fearless spy , the alluring mistress . That Balzac was able to balance the strength of the individual against the representation of the type is evidence of the author 's skill . One critic explained that " there is a center and a circumference to Balzac 's world " . 
 Balzac 's use of repeat characters , moving in and out of the Comédie 's books , strengthens the realist representation . " When the characters reappear " , notes Rogers , " they do not step out of nowhere ; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which , for an interval , we have not been allowed to see " . He also used a realist technique which French novelist Marcel Proust later termed " retrospective illumination " , whereby a character 's past is revealed long after she or he first appears . 
 A nearly infinite reserve of energy propels the characters in Balzac 's novels . Struggling against the currents of human nature and society , they may lose more often than they win — but only rarely do they give up . This universal trait is a reflection of Balzac 's own social wrangling , that of his family , and an interest in the Austrian mystic and physician Franz Mesmer , who pioneered the study of animal magnetism . Balzac spoke often of a " nervous and fluid force " between individuals , and Raphaël de Valentin 's decline in La Peau de Chagrin exemplifies the danger of withdrawing from other people 's company . 
 = = = = Place = = = = 
 Representations of the city , countryside , and building interiors are essential to Balzac 's realism , often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters ' lives follow a particular course ; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist . Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages . As he did with the people around him , Balzac studied these places in depth , traveling to remote locations and comparing notes that he had made on previous visits . 
 The influence of Paris permeates La Comédie : nature defers to the artificial metropolis , in contrast to descriptions of the weather and wildlife in the countryside . " If in Paris " , Rogers says , " we are in a man @-@ made region where even the seasons are forgotten , these provincial towns are nearly always pictured in their natural setting " . Balzac said , " the streets of Paris possess human qualities and we cannot shake off the impressions they make upon our minds . " His labyrinthine city provided a literary model used later by English novelist Charles Dickens and Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky . The centrality of Paris in La Comédie Humaine is key to Balzac 's legacy as a realist . " Realism is nothing if not urban " , notes critic Peter Brooks ; the scene of a young man coming into the city to find his fortune is ubiquitous in the realist novel , and appears repeatedly in Balzac 's works , such as Illusions Perdues . 
 = = = Perspective = = = 
 Balzac 's literary mood evolved over time from one of despondency and chagrin to that of solidarity and courage — but not optimism . La Peau de Chagrin , among his earliest novels , is a pessimistic tale of confusion and destruction . But the cynicism declined as his oeuvre developed , and the characters of Illusions Perdues reveal sympathy for those who are pushed to one side by society . As part of the 19th @-@ century evolution of the novel as a " democratic literary form " , Balzac wrote that " les livres sont faits pour tout le monde " ( " books are written for everybody " ) . 
 Balzac concerned himself overwhelmingly with the darker essence of human nature and the corrupting influence of middle and high societies . His mission was to observe humankind in its most representative state , frequently wandering through the streets incognito among the masses of Parisian society to undertake his research . He used incidents from his life and the people around him , in works like Eugénie Grandet and Louis Lambert . 
 = = = Politics = = = 
 Balzac was a legitimist ; in many ways , his views are the antithesis of Victor Hugo 's democratic republicanism . Nevertheless , his keen insight regarding working @-@ class conditions earned him the esteem of many Socialists and Marxists . Engels declared that Balzac was his favorite writer . Marx 's work Das Kapital also makes constant reference to the works of Balzac and urged Engels to read Balzac 's work The Unknown Masterpiece . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Balzac influenced writers of his time and beyond . He has been compared to Charles Dickens and is considered one of Dickens ' significant influences . Literary critic W. H. Helm calls one " the French Dickens " and the other " the English Balzac " , while another critic , Richard Lehan , states that " Balzac was the bridge between the comic realism of Dickens and the naturalism of Zola " . 
 Gustave Flaubert was also substantially influenced by Balzac . Praising his portrayal of society while attacking his prose style , Flaubert once wrote : " What a man he would have been had he known how to write ! " While he disdained the label of " realist " , Flaubert clearly took heed of Balzac 's close attention to detail and unvarnished depictions of bourgeois life . This influence shows in Flaubert 's work L <unk> <unk> which owes a debt to Balzac 's Illusions Perdues . " What Balzac started " , observes Lehan , " Flaubert helped finish " . 
 Marcel Proust similarly learned from the Realist example ; he adored Balzac and studied his works carefully , although he criticised what he perceived as Balzac 's " vulgarity " . Balzac 's story Une <unk> de ma Vie ( An Hour of my Life , 1822 ) , in which minute details are followed by deep personal reflections , is a clear forebear of the style which Proust used in À la recherche du temps perdu . However , Proust wrote later in life that the contemporary fashion of ranking Balzac higher than Tolstoy was " madness . " 
 Perhaps the author most affected by Balzac was American expatriate novelist Henry James . In 1878 James wrote with sadness about the lack of contemporary attention paid to Balzac , and lavished praise on him in four essays ( in 1875 , 1877 , 1902 , and 1913 ) . In 1878 James wrote : " Large as Balzac is , he is all of one piece and he hangs perfectly together " . He wrote with admiration of Balzac 's attempt to portray in writing " a beast with a hundred claws " . In his own novels James explored more of the psychological motives of the characters and less of the historical sweep exhibited by Balzac — a conscious style preference ; he stated : " the artist of the Comédie Humaine is half smothered by the historian " . Still , both authors used the form of the realist novel to probe the machinations of society and the myriad motives of human behavior . 
 Balzac 's vision of a society in which class , money and personal ambition are the key players has been endorsed by critics of both left @-@ wing and right @-@ wing political persuasions . Marxist Friedrich Engels wrote : " I have learned more [ from Balzac ] than from all the professional historians , economists and statisticians put together " . Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as Walter Benjamin and Camille Paglia . He was also praised by James Baldwin , who said 1984 : " I ’ m sure that my life in France would have been very different had I not met Balzac . [ He taught me ] the way that country and its society works . " In 1970 Roland <unk> published S / Z , a detailed analysis of Balzac 's story Sarrasine and a key work in structuralist literary criticism . 
 Balzac has also influenced popular culture . Many of his works have been made into popular films and television serials , including : Travers Vale 's Père Goriot ( 1915 ) , Les Chouans ( 1947 ) , Le Père Goriot ( 1968 BBC mini @-@ series ) , and La Cousine Bette ( 1974 BBC mini @-@ series , starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren ; 1998 film , starring Jessica Lange ) . He is included in François Truffaut 's 1959 film , The 400 Blows . Truffaut believed Balzac and Proust to be the greatest French writers .

 U.S. Highway 6 ( US 6 ) is an east – west U.S. Highway which runs 319 miles ( 513 km ) across the U.S. state of Iowa . The route is signed in places as the Grand Army of the Republic Highway . Like all state highways in Iowa , it is maintained by the Iowa Department of Transportation . The route begins at the Missouri River crossing at Council Bluffs . From there , it travels east through Oakland and Atlantic . North of Atlantic , the highway overlaps Interstate 80 ( I @-@ 80 ) until De Soto . Between De Soto and Adel , the highway overlaps US 169 before splitting off to the east towards Des Moines . Through the Des Moines area , the highway runs about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north or south of the I @-@ 35 / I @-@ 80 corridor . 
 At Altoona , the route again overlaps I @-@ 80 until Newton , where it splits away from I @-@ 80 . The highway passes near or through the cities of Kellogg , Grinnell , Victor , Marengo , the Amana Colonies , and Tiffin before entering the Coralville / Iowa City area . Through Coralville and Iowa City , US 6 has no direct access to I @-@ 80 , I @-@ 380 , or US 218 ; other routes like Iowa Highway 1 ( Iowa 1 ) and Iowa 965 provide direct access . From Iowa City , the highway heads to the east @-@ southeast through West Liberty and <unk> . Near Wilton , the route heads north to I @-@ 80 where it again overlaps to Davenport . At Davenport , US 6 then follows I @-@ 280 and US 61 before entering the city . On the eastern side of Davenport , it joins I @-@ 74 and enters Bettendorf before leaving Iowa for Illinois . 
 Dating back to 1910 , the route US 6 follows was originally the Great White Way and River @-@ to @-@ River Road . Both were auto trails which connected Council Bluffs and Davenport . When the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926 , the highway was designated U.S. Highway 32 . US 32 was renumbered in 1931 as US 6 was extended to the west coast . As the Interstate Highway System expanded in the 1950 @-@ 1970s , US 6 's importance as a cross @-@ state route was diminished by I @-@ 80 . As a result , the least @-@ traveled sections of the route were moved onto I @-@ 80 and control of the vacated sections of highway was given to local jurisdictions .

 As I @-@ 80 and US 6 approach the Quad Cities metropolitan area , the speed limit drops again to 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . Just within the city limits of Davenport is the I @-@ 280 interchange . US 6 exits to the south to join I @-@ 280 . US 61 also joins I @-@ 280 at this interchange , but from the opposite direction . US 6 only overlaps I @-@ 280 / US 61 for four @-@ fifths mile ( 1 @.@ 3 km ) before exiting onto Kimberly Road . Heading southeast into Davenport , US 6 is a two @-@ lane highway for three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) . At Fairmount Street , it becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway and straightens out to head due east . Near <unk> Mall , it intersects Northwest Boulevard , which becomes Iowa 130 at I @-@ 80 , and both one @-@ way legs , Welcome Way southbound and Brady Street northbound , of US 61 Business , which prior to 2010 was US 61 . US 6 briefly dips to the southeast and straightens out again towards I @-@ 74 . The highway joins I @-@ 74 and heads to the south towards Moline , Illinois . For about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , I @-@ 74 / US 6 forms the boundary of Davenport and Bettendorf . The two routes completely enter Bettendorf and descend into the Mississippi River valley , where they meet US 67 at a complex series of exit and entrance ramps . They then ascend the Iowa @-@ Illinois Memorial Bridge , known locally as the I @-@ 74 Bridge , and cross the Mississippi River into Illinois . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the U.S. Highway System came into being in 1926 , roads in Iowa were maintained and promoted by local organizations which sought to drive traffic into their communities . Two such organizations created virtually parallel routes connecting Council Bluffs and Davenport via Des Moines . The routes , the southern Great White Way and northern River @-@ to @-@ River Road , eventually merged into the Whiteway @-@ 7 @-@ Highway . The new route followed the Great White Way from Council Bluffs to Des Moines and the River @-@ to @-@ River Road from Des Moines to Davenport . In 1926 , the Whiteway @-@ 7 @-@ Highway became US 32 , which itself became US 6 in 1931 . For a time , US 6 was the busiest highway in the state . After I @-@ 80 was built near US 6 , portions of the U.S. Highway were moved onto the Interstate Highway . Interest in the original US 6 corridor has grown in the 21st century by people who seek to drive traffic back into their communities . 
 = = = Great White Way = = = 
 The Great White Way was formed in 1910 by the White Pole Auto Club . The route was built along the Chicago , Rock Island & Pacific Railroad between Council Bluffs and Des Moines . Members of the auto club painted poles along the route white , which lead the route to be known as the White Pole Road . The Great White Way passed through Oakland , Atlantic , Adair , De Soto , and Valley Junction . In late 1912 , the Great White Way was extended east to Davenport , passing through Pella , <unk> , Washington , and Muscatine . In 1913 , when the Iowa State Highway Commission began registering named trails longer than 25 miles ( 40 km ) , the Great White Way Association paid the $ 5 @.@ 00 fee ( $ 120 @.@ 00 in 2016 dollars ) to become the first official registered highway route on July 30 , 1914 . When the primary highway system was created , the Great White Way was assigned Primary Road No. 2 . 
 In 2002 , a group of residents from Adair , Casey , Menlo , Stuart , and Dexter formed a new group to promote the White Pole Road . Their intention was to bring visitors to their towns by diverting some traffic from the nearby I @-@ 80 / US 6 corridor to the south and onto the historic road . Poles painted white up to nine feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) high line the 26 @-@ mile ( 42 km ) drive . White Pole Road logo signs in each town give a short history of the town and their founders . 
 = = = River @-@ to @-@ River Road = = = 
 The River @-@ to @-@ River Road ( RRR ) was also created in 1910 and also connected Council Bluffs and Davenport via Des Moines . This route , however , traveled a more northern route than the Great White Way . The route passed through Neola , Elk Horn , Guthrie Center , Adel , Des Moines , Newton , Marengo , Iowa City , and Wilton . The route 's origins trace back to the 1909 – 10 winter season which brought , on average , 11 inches ( 28 cm ) of snow more than the previous year , which was followed by an unusually dry spring . Coupled with the advent of the Ford Model T , many Iowans complained about the lack of good roads in the state . Governor B.F. Carroll convened a Good Roads convention on March 8 – 9 , 1910 , to discuss the condition of roads in his state . It was then that the route of the RRR was decided among the convention delegates . Further influencing the River @-@ to @-@ River corridor was an announcement from the American Automobile Association that the annual Glidden Tour would pass through Iowa . Gov. Carroll arranged for farmers who lived along the route to drag all 380 miles ( 610 km ) of the road on the Saturday prior to the tour 's arrival at precisely 9 am . Work was finished in one hour . 
 When the highway commission started accepting registered routes , the RRR association planned to register their route as soon as possible . But miscommunication between association members and with the highway commission delayed the actual registration for years . The route became official on April 16 , 1918 . When the primary highway system was created , the River @-@ to @-@ River Road was assigned Primary Road No. 7 . 
 = = = Whiteway @-@ 7 @-@ Highway = = = 
 In 1922 , the Whiteway @-@ 7 @-@ Highway Association filed an application to register the Whiteway @-@ 7 @-@ Highway with the Iowa State Highway Commission . The commission was concerned with the Whiteway @-@ 7 's similarity to the Great White Way 's name and route markings . The Great White Way was marked with a 6 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) stripe , while the Whiteway @-@ 7 would be marked with a 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) stripe with a black circle containing a white seven . Another concern with the new route was since its name contained the number seven , the route would be assigned along Primary Road Nos. 2 and 7 . On September 25 , 1922 , the highway commission gave the Great White Way from Des Moines to Council Bluffs , which would become part of the Whiteway @-@ 7 @-@ Highway , the number 7 and gave the River @-@ to @-@ River Road 's western half number 2 . Eight months later , the Iowa State Highway Commission reversed course and restored Primary Road Nos. 2 and 7 to their original roadways . Although disappointed , the Whiteway @-@ 7 @-@ Highway Association responded by removing the number from their name . On November 27 , 1925 , the route officially became the Whiteway Highway . 
 = = = U.S. Numbered Highways = = = 
 On November 11 , 1926 , members of the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the plan to create a system of interstate highways across the country . Iowa 's Whiteway Highway would take on the designation of US 32 . For four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years , US 32 spanned from Chicago to Council Bluffs . Meanwhile , Roosevelt Highway Association was pushing to have US 6 extended westward . On June 8 , 1931 , all of the Iowa portion of US 32 was absorbed into a newly extended US 6 , which had previously connected Erie , Pennsylvania , and Cape Cod . The new US 6 also replaced US 38 in Nebraska and Colorado . By the end of 1937 , US 6 extended from coast to coast . At the time , it and US 30 were the only cross country highways to bear a single route number across the country . 
 When the last segment of highway between Adel and Des Moines was paved in 1931 , US 6 became the fourth paved road to cross the state . In the early 1940s , US 6 was the most heavily traveled route in the state . The state highway commission recorded that on average , over 1900 vehicles using the road at any rural point . That compares to nearly 3000 vehicles using US 6 daily in 2012 . 
 On April 29 , 1947 , the Iowa General Assembly approved an act designating US 6 as the Grand Army of the Republic Highway , a distinction the route shares in other states . Governor Robert D. Blue dedicated the <unk> Highway at the Old Capitol on September 28 , 1947 . In attendance were the last two surviving Iowa veterans of the Civil War . In the 1950s , the Iowa State Highway Commission began to straighten the route . A section of the highway between Grinnell and Ladora was straightened , which resulted in Brooklyn and Victor being bypassed . Between Dexter and West Des Moines , US 6 swapped alignments with Iowa 90 in 1958 . In 1961 , US 6 was routed onto the new Interstate 80 from the Iowa 90 interchange to the Baxter exit , currently exit 159 . Iowa 90 was extended onto the old US 6 alignment . However , in 1967 , those changes were reversed and US 6 was taken off I @-@ 80 and put back on the road which had been Iowa 90 . Iowa 90 was assigned the section of US 6 between what 's now exit 106 along I @-@ 80 and exit 69 along I @-@ 35 . 
 = = = Abandoned sections = = = 
 Since the 1970s , portions of US 6 have been moved permanently onto I @-@ 80 . The first section , between US 71 and Adair , was rerouted in 1972 . The abandoned section became an extended Iowa 83 and CR G30 in Adair County . In 1980 , three lengthy sections were moved onto the Interstate : 26 miles ( 42 km ) in western Iowa between Adair and Dexter , 25 miles ( 40 km ) in central Iowa between Altoona and Newton , and 20 miles ( 32 km ) in eastern Iowa between Wilton and Davenport . All three sections were originally kept as state highways , but in 1991 , when the Iowa Department of Transportation first showed the new state highways ' designations on the state highway map , the central section already had been turned over to Polk and Jasper counties . The western segment was numbered Iowa 925 and the eastern segment Iowa 927 . 
 On July 1 , 2003 , 15 miles ( 24 km ) between Dexter and Adel were turned over to Dallas County . US 6 , which had previously split away from I @-@ 80 at the Dexter exit , was continued along I @-@ 80 to the US 169 interchange at De Soto , and then along US 169 to Adel . The former segments , Iowa 925 and Iowa 927 , were turned over to their respective counties as well .

 Bieber first began his career through YouTube , posting videos of his performances in singing competitions for family members who could not attend . As his popularity on the website grew , he was discovered by his eventual manager Scooter Braun , who flew Bieber to Atlanta , Georgia to consult with recording artist Usher . He provided him with an audition for L.A. Reid of Island Records , and signed a recording contract in October 2008 . In April 2009 , after recording his debut single " One Time " , Usher described Bieber as a " young phenomenon " and " definitely a priority for me and Island Def Jam . " Bieber later described the record 's title as " the only way [ he ] could really describe it " , adding that it represented " so many elements of [ his ] world " . 
 When recording My World , Bieber expressed a desire to " grow as an artist " and have " [ his ] fans grow with [ him ] " . Musically , the project incorporates pop and R & B styles , similar to the catalogs of Michael Jackson , Stevie Wonder , Chris Brown , Usher , and Ne @-@ Yo . Entertainment Weekly described the record as featuring " sugary puppy @-@ love ballads and dinky dance @-@ pop confections " . Bieber looked to address a variety of lyrical themes , which he described as " songs that teens can relate to " and " just stuff that happens in everyday life " . 
 The introductory track " One Time " discusses an admiration of a female and a desire to become her significant other . " Favorite Girl " shares a similar sentiment , describing the object of his affection as his " prized possession " . The ballad " Down to Earth " was inspired by the divorce of Bieber 's parents , and was written to reassure fans in a similar situation " that it wasn 't because of something they did " . " Bigger " details an aspiration to work past the difficulties a relationship experiences . It was noted for experimenting with New jack swing elements that were prominent in Michael Jackson 's eighth studio album Dangerous , and was also described as a " P.Y.T. rip " . Bieber felt that " One Less Lonely Girl " was " really important [ that ] these girls have something so they can be one less lonely girl " . The track was compared to Chris Brown 's " With You " and Beyoncé 's " Irreplaceable " . " First Dance " features vocals from Usher , and garnered comparisons to Jackson 's " You Are Not Alone " . My World closes with " Love Me " , which samples The Cardigans ' " Lovefool " and was described by MTV News as a " widescreen club track that is full of bubbly synths and Bieber 's now @-@ signature croon " .

 " One Time " was released on 7 July 2009 , as the lead single from My World . It received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who complimented Bieber 's vocals , but noted a lack of originality . The track peaked at number seventeen on the US Billboard Hot 100 , and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for sales exceeding one million copies . Internationally , it peaked at number twelve of the Canadian Hot 100 , where it was later certified platinum for sales over 10 @,@ 000 units . The song also reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart . It attained moderate success in other European territories , peaking within the top thirty in singles charts in Austria , Belgium , and Germany . An accompanying music video was released on 24 November 2009 , and depicted Bieber throwing a party in Usher 's house in his absence . 
 " One Less Lonely Girl " was released on 30 November 2009 , as the second single from My World . It was met with a generally positive response , where Bieber 's vocals were deemed strong enough to overshadow generic lyrical content . The track peaked at numbers ten and fifteen in the United States and Canada , respectively , and was certified platinum in the former country . Internationally , the song charted in the top thirty in Belgium and Germany . Its accompanying music video was released on 30 November 2009 , and depicts Bieber searching for his crush , who had left her scarf at the local laundromat . " Love Me " and " Favorite Girl " were released as promotional singles to the iTunes Store prior to the release of My World . They peaked at numbers thirty @-@ seven and twenty @-@ six on the Billboard Hot 100 , respectively .

 At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , My World received an average score of 65 , based on six reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . Andy Kellman from Allmusic complimented the material as being " the kind of age @-@ appropriate content that would fill out a release from a younger Chris Brown or a junior version of Ne @-@ Yo " , adding that his charisma made up for lacking lyrical depth . Writing for Billboard , a reviewer opined that the strength of the material opened the possibility of Bieber " racking up more hits in the next decade to come " . Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commended " Love Me " as a " killer electro @-@ glam groove " and expressed a desire to see Bieber 's " swagger " advance with age . The New York Times 's Jon Caramanica provided a favorable review , describing " One Less Lonely Girl " as an " uncomplicatedly beautiful and earnest " track . 
 Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone selected " First Dance " , " Bigger " , and " Love Me " as his personal stand @-@ out tracks from the project . Toronto Star 's Ashante Infantry described Bieber 's vocals as those of a " young Chris Brown with overdubbed New Edition @-@ style harmonies " , adding that the production and songwriting worked well with his " earnest pubescent vocals " . Writing for The Boston Globe , Marc Hirsch provided a mixed review , commenting that Bieber was " indistinguishable " from the popular mainstream artists , but noted " Down to Earth " as an " essential " track from the record . Alison Stewart from The Washington Post was pleased that Bieber co @-@ wrote several of the tracks , but was less optimistic of the prominent use of Auto @-@ Tune . At the Juno Awards of 2010 , My World was nominated for the Album of the Year and the Pop Album of the Year , but lost to Crazy Love by Michael Bublé in both categories .

 = Wallkill Valley Rail Trail = 
 The Wallkill Valley Rail Trail is a 23 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 38 @.@ 1 km ) rail trail and linear park that runs along the former Wallkill Valley Railroad rail corridor in Ulster County , New York . It stretches from Gardiner through New Paltz , Rosendale , and Ulster to the Kingston city line . The trail is separated from the Walden – Wallkill Rail Trail by two state prisons in Shawangunk , though there have been plans to bypass these facilities , and to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with other regional rail trails . 
 Plans to create the rail trail began as early as 1983 , when New Paltz considered uses for the then @-@ defunct Wallkill Valley corridor ; the railroad had ceased regular traffic in 1977 , and by 1983 had begun to remove its tracks . In 1991 , a local land trust purchased the 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) section of the former rail corridor between New Paltz and Gardiner , and conveyed the New Paltz section to the town and village of New Paltz . The trail was formally opened between New Paltz and Gardiner in 1993 , though Gardiner did not purchase its section from the trust until 2007 . The length of the trail was effectively doubled by a county land seizure in 2009 , extending the walkway north from Rosendale through Ulster to Kingston . The extension included the Rosendale trestle , a 940 @-@ foot ( 290 m ) bridge across the Rondout Creek . There are several other bridges that carry the trail , though none are as long . 
 The trail serves hikers , joggers , bikers , horseback riders , and cross @-@ country skiers . It passes through several historic districts , such as Huguenot Street in New Paltz , and the Binnewater Historic District and Snyder Estate in Rosendale . The trail also traverses U.S. Route 44 ( concurrent with State Route 55 ) , and state routes 299 and 213 . Several natural features are visible from clearing along the trail , such as the Shawangunk Ridge to the west , and the Plattekill Creek between New Paltz and Gardiner . The trail passes through dense vegetation , and is frequented by many types of animals and overwintering birds . 
 = = History = = 
 Stretching 33 miles ( 53 km ) from Montgomery to Kingston , the Wallkill Valley Railroad operated from 1866 until its last regular freight run on December 31 , 1977 . During the 1980s , its owner , Conrail , began to salvage the former corridor 's steel rails and sell off sections of the rail bed . State law mandated that in such sales , offers be made first to the state , then to the involved counties and municipalities . The state bought a 1 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) portion of rail bed between Shawangunk and Gardiner in November 1985 for the construction of the Shawangunk Correctional Facility in the hamlet of Wallkill . 
 While Montgomery and Shawangunk purchased their sections of the railroad – 2 @.@ 0 and 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 and 3 @.@ 7 km ) , respectively – in 1985 , eventually creating the 3 @.@ 22 @-@ mile ( 5 @.@ 18 km ) Walden – Wallkill Rail Trail , the towns of New Paltz , Gardiner and Rosendale initially declined to purchase their sections of the rail line . The town of Shawangunk has been evaluating plans to bypass the state prison to connect the Walden – Wallkill and Wallkill Valley trails since 2004 , and such a connection was listed as a project in a 2008 county @-@ wide transportation plan . The latest proposal involves diverting the trail along Birch Road . The Wallkill Valley Rail Trail was the seventeenth rail trail created in New York state , and became a National Recreation Trail in 2007 . 
 = = = New Paltz and Gardiner = = = 
 Converting the former corridor to a rail trail was first considered in a 1983 environmental report commissioned by the town of New Paltz . The study considered repurposing the corridor as a road for cars , but determined that the right @-@ of @-@ way , " lend [ ing ] itself to multiple and simultaneous ' people @-@ oriented ' transit " , was " ideally suited for use as a trail for hiking , strolling , running , cycling and cross @-@ country skiing " . In 1988 , New Paltz invited a local non @-@ profit , the Wallkill Valley Land Trust , to acquire the portion of the rail line between New Paltz and Gardiner . The Wallkill Valley Land Trust in turn requested assistance from The Trust for Public Land , and the purchase was completed on January 18 , 1991 . 
 While the town and village of New Paltz immediately purchased their sections from the Wallkill Valley Land Trust – roughly 4 and 3 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 and 4 @.@ 8 km ) , respectively – Gardiner did not purchase its 6 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) section until much later . Portions of the New Paltz – Gardiner section were informally open since June 1991 , but the formal opening ceremony of the full 12 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 19 @.@ 6 km ) trail between New Paltz and Gardiner took place on October 9 , 1993 . 
 The Gardiner section was in such a state of disrepair in 2004 that the Wallkill Valley Land Trust almost closed it . Gardiner received a $ 100 @,@ 000 grant from the New York State Office of Parks , Recreation and Historic Preservation in December 2006 , and the purchase was completed in 2007 . The state provided an additional $ 5 @,@ 000 to maintain the trail . 
 Purchasing the section allowed Gardiner to fix the drainage problems that had deteriorated the surface of the trail , and to ban the use of motor vehicles , something the Wallkill Valley Land Trust had not done . Though the section was worth $ 307 @,@ 300 , the Wallkill Valley Land Trust sold it to Gardiner for $ 70 @,@ 000 . 
 In 2009 and 2010 , the Tea Party movement held protests along the Gardiner section of the trail . In November 2009 , New Paltz received grants from the Greenway Conservancy , a state organization , to fund several rail trail – related projects . This included $ 17 @,@ 750 to create a link between the New Paltz section of the trail and the Hudson Valley Rail Trail in nearby Lloyd , which was in turn being extended eastward to the Poughkeepsie Bridge ; the connection with the bridge was completed in October 2010 . The Wallkill Valley Railroad had considered such a connection after the bridge opened in 1889 , but never built one . The grants also included $ 7 @,@ 000 to create 400 feet ( 120 m ) of ADA @-@ accessible trail , to connect the parking area of a local park , named after Sojourner Truth , with the rail trail . The town had intended to connect the parking area with the trail since the late 1990s , but concerns over traffic , as well as state requirements , had added to the time and cost of the path ; it was completed by June 2010 . The connections are part of a county @-@ wide plan to create a bicycle path along NY 299 , to link regional rail trails . 
 = = = Rosendale = = = 
 The Rosendale portion of the rail bed runs 11 @.@ 5 miles ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) from Rosendale through Ulster to Kingston and contains the 940 @-@ foot ( 290 m ) Rosendale trestle . The trestle rises 150 feet ( 46 m ) above the Rondout Creek and State Route 213 , and also spans the former Delaware and Hudson Canal . At the time of its construction it was the highest span bridge in the United States . 
 Conrail sold the Rosendale section , including the bridge , in 1986 to a private businessman , John E. Rahl , for one dollar . Rahl maintained that the purchase granted him the right to " restore rail service on the whole Wallkill line " , and to joint ownership of Conrail . Between 1989 and 1991 , Rahl installed planking and guard rails on the southern half of the bridge , which was then opened to the public . He intended to allow bungee jumping off the bridge , and did so until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws . Douglas Hase , an entrepreneur who had run both bungee jumping and hot air ballooning companies , tried unsuccessfully in 2003 and 2004 to get a variance for such a venture . 
 After Rahl failed to pay $ 13 @,@ 716 in property taxes over a period of three years , Ulster County foreclosed on the 63 @.@ 34 @-@ acre ( 25 @.@ 63 ha ) property on April 15 , 2009 . The Wallkill Valley Land Trust and Open Space Conservancy placed a bid on the land parcels comprising the Rosendale section on April 22 , 2009 , and agreed to pay all outstanding taxes before receiving full ownership on July 8 , 2009 , with the intention of adding it to the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail . Following an engineering survey , the bridge was closed to the public in June 2009 for repairs . Renovations are now compete ( 2013 ) and the full length of the bridge is now open . 
 Canopy Development , a green development company from Northampton , Massachusetts , owns a portion of the former rail bed in Rosendale . It has agreed to establish a right @-@ of @-@ way , rerouting the trail to allow public access . Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool , which will be bypassed . The Mohonk Preserve and Open Space Conservancy were given a $ 20 @,@ 000 state grant in March 2011 to maintain the portion of the trail by Kingston . By the end of summer 2013 , the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale @-@ Kingston extension was opened to the public , completing the entire 23 @.@ 7 mile rail trail . 
 A regional business association has proposed a link between the trail , in Rosendale , and a series of regional rail trails . The proposal would create a 35 @-@ mile ( 56 km ) network of rail trails across the towns of <unk> , Rochester , and <unk> . Several involved towns have been working toward accomplishing such a connection . 
 = = Route = = 
 The trail begins at Denniston Road , in the southern part of the town of Gardiner . Movement farther south is impossible , because the corridor south of Denniston Road is fenced off by barbed wire . After roughly 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) , it crosses Sand Hill Road before approaching the hamlet of Gardiner at the 2 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) mark . Once in the hamlet , the trail intersects U.S. Route 44 ( concurrent with State Route 55 ) . 
 Located within the hamlet are a defunct , former dairy creamery and the site of the former Gardiner railroad station . Built in 1881 and opened the following year , the creamery was one of the dairies that transported its products to New York City by way of the Wallkill Valley Railroad . It was originally the property of the Borden family , but closed in the 1920s , and has since been renovated as an apartment complex . The former Gardiner railroad station ceased operations when the rail line closed . It became a sporting goods store by 1981 , a video store by the early 1990s , and an antique store by 1995 . The station burned down on October 10 , 2002 . 
 The trail crosses Phillies Bridge Road 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the hamlet , with an overpass carrying the trail over Forest Glen Road 3 ⁄ 4 mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) farther . The road overlies the Catskill Aqueduct and Delaware Aqueduct . Originally supported by trestles and a stone foundation , the overpass was rebuilt in 1910 during the construction of the Catskill Aqueduct . The reconstruction removed the trestles and added a concrete foundation . Though a local legend holds that the bridge was originally built in response to the death of a prominent woman at the Forest Glen railroad crossing , it is more likely that it was built to maintain the rail line at a consistent grade . A little over 1 ⁄ 10 mile ( 0 @.@ 16 km ) from the bridge is the site of the former Forest Glen station . The trail crosses Bridge Creek Road and Old Ford Road about 1 ⁄ 4 and 1 mile ( 0 @.@ 40 and 1 @.@ 61 km ) from the Forest Glen bridge , respectively , before entering the town of New Paltz . 
 Shortly after entering New Paltz , the trail crosses a bridge over Plattekill Creek . The masonry for the bridge was completed by late June 1870 , and trestle work was done by July . Originally made of wood , the bridge was accidentally set on fire in 1880 by ashes or sparks from a passing train . This prompted the railroad to coat its rail ties with tin while replacing its wooden bridges with ones made of stone . The bridge 's original abutments were made of Shawangunk conglomerate . It was rebuilt in 1912 , and crosses the Plattekill Creek at a height of 35 feet ( 11 m ) . The Shawangunk Ridge is visible from the bridge . 
 Plains Road is shortly after the bridge , and the trail continues for 3 ⁄ 10 mile ( 0 @.@ 48 km ) before crossing Cedar Lane . It crosses Plains Road again after another 1 1 ⁄ 5 miles ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) , reaching the Sojourner Truth park in the village of New Paltz . The trail is connected to the park via a small footbridge constructed in 2010 by the Alexandria , Minnesota – based construction company <unk> . It has a weight limit of 5 short tons ( 4 @.@ 5 t ) and is able to withstand earthquakes . 
 At the edge of the park , the trail crosses Water Street and enters the Water Street Market , a " restored area of boutiques , galleries , and cafés " . It then crosses State Route 299 and passes La Stazione , the former railroad station . The refurbished depot had been originally built in 1870 , rebuilt after a 1907 fire , and sold to private interests in 1959 . The building was in a state of disrepair by the early 1980s , but renovated in 1988 and converted to an Italian restaurant in 1999 . Over the next 1 ⁄ 2 mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) , the trail passes North Front Street , Broadhead Avenue , and Mulberry Street . After another 1 ⁄ 2 mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) the trail traverses Huguenot Street , a historic district containing colonial @-@ era stone houses . Some of the houses date to the late 1600s . 
 About 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from Huguenot Street , the trail reaches the 413 @-@ foot ( 126 m ) Springtown bridge spanning the Wallkill River . The bridge was originally made of wood and completed by the middle of December 1870 , but was rebuilt between 1880 and 1881 , using iron , by Clarke , Reeves & Co . It was rated by the superintendent of the Wallkill Valley Railroad to be safe for rail traffic as fast as 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) . The bridge 's decking and benches were put in place in 1993 by volunteers and members of the nearby <unk> community in the hamlet of <unk> . The design of the bridge 's railings was influenced by equestrians to better accommodate horses . Immediately after the bridge is Springtown Road . 
 The trail continues west of the Wallkill River . Roughly 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the Springtown bridge , the trail crosses <unk> Road . Another 3 ⁄ 10 mile ( 0 @.@ 48 km ) farther , it reaches the New Paltz – Rosendale boundary line , continuing another 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) on formerly private property to Mountain Road in the hamlet of Rosendale . Restorations to the Rosendale trestle were completed , and the bridge was opened to the public in June , 2013 . This added 11 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) over the Rondout Creek to Kingston , crossing Interstate 87 and terminating by State Route 32 . The extension passes through the town of Ulster and includes four small bridges between Rosendale and Kingston .

 The road between the former railroad station and Water Street Market was the first site of a new town crosswalk system that opened on March 29 , 2008 . Under the new system , pedestrians can use flags placed in roadside containers to signal traffic . The trail connects with the Sojourner Truth park , which has had access to the Wallkill River for kayaking and canoeing since April 27 , 2003 . The Minnewaska Preserve and Mohonk Preserve , featuring 60 miles ( 97 km ) of combined walkways , can be reached through New Paltz . In the past , students at nearby SUNY New Paltz have used the trail for " legend [ ary , ] massive keg parties [ and ] ... opportunities to be romantic " . As part of an August 2010 art exhibit depicting concealed weapons laws , the Samuel <unk> Museum of Art placed pieces of the exhibit throughout areas of New Paltz expected to have heavy pedestrian traffic , including the rail trail . 
 The trail connects to the Binnewater Historic District in Rosendale . The district was the location of several local quarries which opened throughout the region after the 1825 discovery of rocks capable of producing Rosendale cement in the nearby hamlet of High Falls . At its peak , the district was producing 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 barrels a year and employed 5 @,@ 000 people . 
 Though the Binnewater rail station was once part of the historic district , it was located too close to Binnewater Road and was hit repeatedly by trucks until it fell apart in May 1989 . The station was subsequently demolished by the county highway department . Another historic district , the Snyder Estate , runs along the Rosendale section . The Snyder Estate is a former mining site once used by all four major regional cement producers . The Rosendale trestle has been the site of numerous picnics , barbecues , and at least one wedding . One person has tried bungee jumping off the bridge without a restraining cord . 
 Several shale outcrops are visible along the trail , with views of the Shawangunk Ridge to the west ; the <unk> tower of the Mohonk Mountain House is visible on one of the cliffs . Parking for the trail is provided at a municipal lot on Farmers Turnpike in Gardiner . In New Paltz , there are parking lots at the Sojourner Truth park , off Springtown Road , at the Huguenot Historical Society , and at a Board of Cooperative Educational Services ( BOCES ) conference center . The trail runs parallel to state routes 208 and 32 ; there are two park and rides on Route 32 , a 63 @-@ spot lot in New Paltz , and a 58 @-@ spot lot in Rosendale . There are two bicycle shops along the trail in both Gardiner and New Paltz . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 Flora along the northern end of the trail includes sumac ( Rhus ) and honeysuckle ( Lonicera ) shrubs , American elm ( Ulmus americana ) , <unk> aspen ( Populus <unk> ) and quaking aspen ( Populus tremuloides ) . As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south , there are occurrences of sugar maple ( Acer saccharum ) , American beech ( Fagus grandifolia ) , tulip @-@ tree ( Liriodendron tulipifera ) and black birch ( Betula lenta ) .

 = Evolution of lemurs = 
 The evolutionary history of lemurs occurred in isolation from other primates , on the island of Madagascar , for at least 40 million years . Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini , which branched off from other primates less than 63 mya ( million years ago ) . They share some traits with the most basal primates , and thus are often confused as being ancestral to modern monkeys , apes , and humans . Instead , they merely resemble ancestral primates . 
 Lemurs are thought to have evolved during the Eocene or earlier , sharing a closest common ancestor with lorises , pottos , and galagos ( lorisoids ) . Fossils from Africa and some tests of nuclear DNA suggest that lemurs made their way to Madagascar between 40 and 52 mya . Other mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence comparisons offer an alternative date range of 62 to 65 mya . An ancestral lemur population is thought to have inadvertently rafted to the island on a floating mat of vegetation , although hypotheses for land bridges and island hopping have also been proposed . The timing and number of hypothesized colonizations has traditionally hinged on the phylogenetic affinities of the aye @-@ aye , the most basal member of the lemur clade . 
 Having undergone their own independent evolution on Madagascar , lemurs have diversified to fill many niches normally filled by other types of mammals . They include the smallest primates in the world , and once included some of the largest . Since the arrival of humans approximately 2 @,@ 000 years ago , lemurs are now restricted to 10 % of the island , or approximately 60 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 23 @,@ 000 square miles ) , and many face extinction . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini . Like other strepsirrhine primates , such as lorises , pottos , and galagos , they share ancestral traits with early primates . In this regard , lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates ; however , lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes , but evolved independently on Madagascar . 
 Primates first evolved sometime between the Middle Cretaceous and the early Paleocene periods on either the supercontinent of Laurasia or in Africa . According to molecular clock studies , the last common ancestor of all primates dates to around 79 @.@ 6 mya , although the earliest known fossil primates are only 54 – 55 million years old . The closest relatives of primates are the extinct plesiadapiforms , the modern colugos ( commonly and inaccurately named " flying lemurs " ) , and treeshrews . Some of the earliest known true primates are represented by the fossil groups <unk> , Eosimiidae , and Adapiformes . 
 The relationship between known fossil primate families remains unclear . A conservative estimate for the divergence of haplorhines ( tarsiers , monkeys , apes , and humans ) and strepsirrhines is 58 to 63 mya . A consensus is emerging that places omomyids as a sister group to tarsiers , <unk> as a stem group to simians ( non @-@ tarsier haplorhines ) , and Djebelemur , an African genus likely to be related to an early Asian branch of cercamoniine adapiforms , as a stem group to modern strepsirrhines , including lemurs . In 2009 , a highly publicized and scientifically criticized publication proclaimed that a 47 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old adapiform fossil , Darwinius masillae , demonstrated both adapiform and simian traits , making it a transitional form between the prosimian and simian lineages . Media sources inaccurately dubbed the fossil as a " missing link " between lemurs and humans . 
 Lemurs were traditionally thought to have evolved during the Eocene ( 55 to 37 mya ) based on the fossil record , although molecular tests suggest the Paleocene ( 66 to 56 mya ) or later . Until recently , they were thought to have descended directly from the diverse group of adapiforms due to several shared postcranial traits , as well as long snouts and small brains . Although adapiforms also had lemur @-@ like auditory bullae , a prosimian characteristic , they had smaller brains and longer snouts than lemurs . There are also several other morphological differences . Most noticeably , adapiforms lack a key derived trait , the toothcomb , and possibly the toilet @-@ claw , found not only in extant ( living ) strepsirrhines but also in tarsiers . Unlike lemurs , adapiforms exhibited a fused mandibular symphysis ( a characteristic of simians ) and also possessed four premolars , instead of three or two . 
 Comparative studies of the cytochrome b gene , which are frequently used to determine phylogenetic relationships among mammals — particularly within families and genera — have been used to show that lemurs share common ancestry with lorisoids . This conclusion is also corroborated by the shared strepsirrhine toothcomb , an unusual trait that is unlikely to have evolved twice . If adapiforms were the ancestors of the living strepsirrhines , then the last common ancestor of modern strepsirrhines would have to predate the early Eocene , a view supported by molecular phylogenetic studies by Anne D. Yoder and <unk> Yang in 2004 , which showed that lemurs split from lorises approximately 62 to 65 mya . These dates were confirmed by more extensive tests by Julie Horvath et al. in 2008 . These molecular studies also showed that <unk> diversified before the modern lorisoids . Using a more limited data set and only nuclear genes , another study in 2005 by Céline Poux et al. dated the split between lemurs and lorises at 60 mya , lemur diversification at 50 mya , and the lemur colonization of Madagascar somewhere between these two approximate dates . However , the 2003 discovery of fossil lorisoids at the Fayum Depression in Egypt pushed the date of lorisoid divergence back to the Eocene , matching the divergence dates predicted by Yoder and Horvath . 
 The fossil record tells a different story . Although it cannot show the earliest possible date for the appearance of a taxonomic group , other concerns have arisen about these vastly earlier divergence dates predicted independently of the fossil record . First , palaeontologists have expressed concerns that if primates have been around for significantly more than 66 million years , then the first one @-@ third of the primate fossil record is missing . Another problem is that some of these molecular dates have overestimated the divergence of other mammalian orders , such as Rodentia , suggesting primate divergence might also be overestimated . One of the oldest known strepsirrhines , Djebelemur , dates from the early Eocene of northern Africa and lacks a fully differentiated toothcomb . Based on fossils and other genetic tests , a more conservative estimate dates the divergence between lemurs and lorises to around 50 to 55 mya . 
 To complicate the ancestry puzzle , no terrestrial Eocene or Paleocene fossils have been found on Madagascar , and the fossil record from both Africa and Asia around this time is not much better . Fossil sites in Madagascar are restricted to only five windows in time , which omit most of the Cenozoic , from 66 mya to ~ 26 @,@ 000 years ago . What little fossil @-@ bearing rock exists from this vast span of time is dominated by marine strata along the west coast . The oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene . 
 = = = Colonization of Madagascar = = = 
 Once part of the supercontinent Gondwana , Madagascar broke away from eastern Africa , the likely source of the ancestral lemur population , about 160 mya and then from Antarctica between 80 and 130 mya . Initially , the island drifted south from where it split from Africa ( around modern Somalia ) until it reached its current position between 80 and 90 mya . Around that time , it split with India , leaving it isolated in the Indian Ocean and separated from nearby Africa by the Mozambique Channel , a deep channel with a minimum width of approximately 560 km ( 350 mi ) . These separation dates and the estimated age of the primate lineage preclude any possibility that lemurs could have been on the island before Madagascar pulled away from Africa , an evolutionary process known as vicariance . In support of this , mammalian fossils on Madagascar from the Cretaceous ( see Mesozoic mammals of Madagascar ) include gondwanatheres and other mammalian groups that would not have been ancestral to lemurs or the other endemic mammals present on the island today . 
 With Madagascar already geographically isolated by the Paleocene and lemur diversification dating to the same time , an explanation was needed for how lemurs had made it to the island . In the 19th century , prior to the theory of continental drift , scientists including Philip Sclater , Étienne Geoffroy Saint @-@ Hilaire , and Ernst Haeckel suggested that Madagascar and India were once part of a southern continent — named Lemuria by Sclater — that has since disappeared under the Indian Ocean . By the early 20th century , oceanic dispersal emerged as the most popular explanation for how lemurs reached the island . The idea first took shape under the anti @-@ plate tectonics movement of the early 1900s , when renowned paleontologist William Diller Matthew proposed the idea in his influential article " Climate and Evolution " in 1915 . In the article , Matthew could only account for the presence of lemurs in Madagascar by " rafting " . In the 1940s , American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term " sweepstakes dispersal " for such unlikely events . 
 As plate tectonics theory took hold , oceanic dispersal fell out of favor and was even considered by many researchers to be " miraculous " if it occurred . Despite the low likelihood of its occurrence , oceanic dispersal remains the most accepted explanation for numerous vertebrate colonizations of Madagascar , including that of the lemurs . Although unlikely , over long periods of time terrestrial animals can occasionally raft to remote islands on floating mats of tangled vegetation , which get flushed out to sea from major rivers by floodwaters . 
 Any extended ocean voyage without fresh water or food would prove difficult for a large , warm @-@ blooded ( homeothermic ) mammal , but today many small , nocturnal species of lemur exhibit <unk> , which allows them to lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves . Such a trait in a small , nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and could have been passed on to its descendants . However , this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date , and could have evolved on Madagascar in response to the island 's harsh environmental conditions . 
 Because only five terrestrial orders of mammals have made it to the island , each likely to have derived from a single colonization , and since these colonizations date to either the early Cenozoic or the early Miocene , the conditions for oceanic dispersal to Madagascar seem to have been better during two separate periods in the past . A report published in January 2010 supported this assumption by demonstrating that both Madagascar and Africa were 1 @,@ 650 km ( 1 @,@ 030 mi ) south of their present @-@ day positions around 60 mya , placing them in a different ocean gyre and reversing the strong current that presently flows away from Madagascar . The currents were even shown to be stronger than they are today , shortening the rafting time to approximately 30 days or less , making the crossing much easier for a small mammal . Over time , as the continental plates drifted northward , the currents gradually changed , and by 20 mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed . 
 Since the 1970s , the rafting hypothesis has been called into question by claims that lemur family Cheirogaleidae might be more closely related to the other Afro @-@ Asian strepsirrhines than to the rest of the lemurs . This idea was initially based on similarities in behavior and molar morphology , although it gained support with the 2001 discovery of 30 ‑ million @-@ year @-@ old Bugtilemur in Pakistan and the 2003 discovery of 40 ‑ million @-@ year @-@ old Karanisia in Egypt . Karanisia is the oldest fossil found that bears a toothcomb , whereas Bugtilemur was thought to have a toothcomb , but also had even more similar molar morphology to Cheirogaleus ( dwarf lemurs ) . If these relationships had been correct , the dates of these fossils would have had implications on the colonization of Madagascar , requiring two separate events . The most parsimonious explanation , given the genetic evidence and the absence of toothcombed primates in European fossil sites , is that stem strepsirrhines evolved on the Afro @-@ Arabian landmass , dispersing to Madagascar and more recently from Africa to Asia . More recently , the structure and general presence of the toothcomb in Bugtilemur has been questioned , as well as many other dental features , suggesting it is most likely an adapiform . 
 An alternative form of oceanic dispersal that had been considered was island hopping , where the lemur ancestors might have made it to Madagascar in small steps by colonizing exposed seamounts during times of low sea level . However , this is unlikely since the only seamounts found along the Davie Ridge would have been too small in such a wide channel . Even though the Comoro Islands between Africa and Madagascar are significantly larger , they are too young , having been formed by volcanic activity only around 8 mya . A land bridge between Madagascar and Africa has also been proposed , but a land bridge would have facilitated the migration of a much greater sampling of Africa 's mammalian fauna than is endemic to the island . Furthermore , deep trenches separate Madagascar from the mainland , and prior to the Oligocene , sea level was significantly higher than today . 
 A variant of the land bridge hypothesis has been proposed in an attempt to explain both how a land bridge could have formed , and why other mammalian orders failed to cross it . Geological studies have shown that following the collision of India and Asia , the Davie Fracture Zone had been pushed up by tectonic forces , possibly high enough to create a land bridge . Indeed , core samples along the Davie Fracture Zone suggest that at least parts of the Mozambique Channel were above sea level between 45 and 26 mya , or possibly as early as 55 mya . Following the Indian @-@ Asian collision , the fault type changed from a strike @-@ slip fault to a normal fault , and seafloor spreading created compression along the Davie Fracture Zone , causing it to rise . By the early Miocene , the East African Rift created tension along the fault , causing it to subside beneath the ocean . The divergence dates of many Malagasy mammalian orders formerly fell within this window . Old World monkeys , dogs , and cats did not diverge or arrive in Africa until later in the Miocene . However , more recent dating of divergence of the Malagasy mammalian clades falls outside of this land bridge window , and a much greater diversity of mammal groups would be expected on Madagascar had the land bridge been present during that stretch of time . 
 The dating of the lemur colonization is controversial for the same reasons as strepsirrhine evolution . Using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences , a single colonization has been estimated at 62 to 65 mya based on the split between the aye @-@ aye and the rest of the lemurs . On the other hand , the sparse fossil record and some estimates based on other nuclear genes support a more recent estimate of 40 to 52 mya . Furthermore , a fossil strepsirrhine primate from Africa , Plesiopithecus , may suggest that the aye @-@ aye and the rest of the lemurs diverged in Africa , which would require at least two colonization events . 
 Once safely established on Madagascar , with its limited mammalian population , the lemurs were protected from the increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups . Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene , and their intelligence , aggression , and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in Africa and Asia , ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids . 
 = = = Diversification = = = 
 The ancestral lemur that colonized Madagascar is thought to have been small and nocturnal . More specifically , it is thought to have had adapiform @-@ like cranial anatomy — particularly the cranial foramina and the middle ear — comparable to that of lemurids , while being similar to cheirogaleids in dentition and postcranial anatomy . 
 Nothing definitive is known about the island 's biogeography at the time of the colonization , however , the paleoclimate ( ancient weather patterns ) may have been affected by Madagascar 's location below the subtropical ridge at 30 ° S latitude and disruption of the weather patterns by India as it drifted northward . Both would have created a drying effect on Madagascar , and as a result , the arid spiny bush that is currently found in the south and southwest of Madagascar would have dominated the island . This would have placed strong selection pressure for drought tolerance on the inhabitants of the island between the Cretaceous and the Eocene . As Madagascar edged above the subtropical ridge and India moved closer to Asia , the climate became less dry and the arid spiny bush retreated to the south and southwest . 
 Lemurs have diversified greatly since first reaching Madagascar . The aye @-@ aye and its extinct relations are thought to have diverged first , shortly after colonization . According to molecular studies , there have since been two major episodes of diversification , from which all other known extant and extinct family lineages emerged . The remaining families diverged in the first diversification episode , during a 10 to 12 million @-@ year window between the Late Eocene ( 42 mya ) and into the Oligocene ( 30 mya ) . The dates for this divergence window span the Eocene – Oligocene extinction event , during which time climate cooling took place and changes in ocean currents altered weather patterns . Outside of Madagascar , these dates also coincide with the divergence of the lorisoid primates and five major clades of squirrels , all occupying niches similar to those of lemurs . The dates do not suggest that increased predation drove family @-@ level divergence since the first carnivores arrived on the island between 24 and 18 mya . The precise relationship between the four of the five families of lemurs is disputed since they diverged during this narrow and distant window . Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae , some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first , while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off . 
 The second major episode of diversification occurred during the Late Miocene , approximately 8 to 12 mya , and included the true lemurs ( Eulemur ) and the mouse lemurs ( Microcebus ) . This event coincided with the beginning of the Indian monsoons , the last major change in climate to affect Madagascar . The populations of both the true lemurs and mouse lemurs were thought to have diverged due to habitat fragmentation when humans arrived on the island roughly 2 @,@ 000 years ago . Only recently has molecular research shown a more distant split in these genera . Most surprising were the mouse lemurs , a group which is now thought to contain cryptic species , meaning they are indistinguishable from each other based solely on appearance . In contrast , true lemurs are easier to distinguish and exhibit sexual dichromatism . Studies in karyology , molecular genetics , and biogeographic patterns have also assisted in understanding their phylogeny and diversification . Although the divergence estimates for these two genera are imprecise , they overlap with a change to a wetter climate in Madagascar , as new weather patterns generated monsoons and likely influenced the plant life . 
 This difference in evolutionary divergence between the two genera may be due to differences in their activity patterns . True lemurs are often diurnal , allowing potential mates to distinguish each other as well as other related species visually . Mouse lemurs , on the other hand , are nocturnal , reducing their ability to use visual signals for mate selection . Instead , they use olfactory and auditory signaling . For these reasons , true lemurs may have evolved sexual dichromatism while mouse lemurs evolved to be cryptic species . 
 = = Distribution and diversity = = 
 Since their arrival on Madagascar , lemurs have diversified both in behavior and morphology . Their diversity rivals that of the monkeys and apes found throughout the rest of the world , especially when the recently extinct subfossil lemurs are considered . Ranging in size from the 30 g ( 1 @.@ 1 oz ) Madame Berthe 's mouse lemur , the world 's smallest primate , to the extinct 160 – 200 kg ( 350 – 440 lb ) Archaeoindris fontoynonti , lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion , varying levels of social complexity , and unique adaptations to the local climate . They went on to fill many niches normally occupied by monkeys , squirrels , woodpeckers , and large grazing ungulates . In addition to the incredible diversity between lemur families , there has also been great diversification among closely related lemurs . Yet despite separation by geographical barriers or by niche differentiation in sympatry , occasionally hybridization can occur . Lemur diversification has also created generalist species , such as the true lemurs of northern Madagascar , which are very adaptable , mostly nondescript , and found throughout most of the island 's forests . 
 Most of the 99 living lemur taxa are found only on Madagascar . Two species , the common brown lemur ( Eulemur fulvus ) and the mongoose lemur ( Eulemur mongoz ) , can also be found on the Comoro Islands , although it is assumed that both species were introduced to the islands from northwestern Madagascar by humans within the last few hundred years . Molecular studies on Eulemur fulvus fulvus ( from the mainland ) and E. f. <unk> ( from the Comoro Islands ) and on Comoro and mainland mongoose lemurs have supported this assumption by showing no genetic differences between the two populations . Because all lemurs , including these two brown lemur species , are only native to the island of Madagascar , they are considered to be endemic . 
 Historically , lemurs ranged across the entire island inhabiting a wide variety of habitats , including dry deciduous forests , lowland forests , spiny thickets , subhumid forests , montane forest , and mangrove . Today , their collective range is restricted to 10 % of the island , or approximately 60 @,@ 000 km2 ( 23 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . Most of the remaining forests and lemurs are found along the periphery of the island . The center of the island , the Hauts @-@ Plateaux , was converted by early settlers to rice paddies and grassland through slash @-@ and @-@ burn agriculture , known locally as tavy . As erosion depleted the soil , the cyclical forest regrowth and burning ended as the forest gradually failed to return . Today , the level of floral diversity increases with precipitation , from the dry southern forests to the wetter northern forests to the rainforests along the east coast . Increased foliage corresponds to increased faunal diversity , including the diversity and complexity of lemur communities . 
 Having evolved in Madagascar 's challenging environment , replete with poor soils , extreme shifts in poor , seasonal plant productivity , and devastating climatic events such as extended droughts and annual cyclones , lemurs have adopted unique combinations of unusual traits to survive , distinguishing them significantly from other primates . In response to limited , seasonal resources , lemurs may exhibit seasonal fat storage , <unk> ( including torpor and hibernation in some cheirogaleids ) , small group sizes , low encephalization ( relative brain size ) , <unk> ( activity both day and night ) , and / or strict breeding seasons . <unk> , extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are thought to have resulted in three other relatively common lemur traits : female dominance , sexual monomorphism ( lack of size differences between the sexes ) , and male – male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism ( conflict ) , such as sperm competition . 
 The arrival of humans on the island 1 @,@ 500 to 2 @,@ 000 years ago has taken a significant toll , not only on the size of lemur populations , but also on their diversity . Due to habitat destruction and hunting , at least 17 species and 8 genera have gone extinct and the populations of all species have decreased . A couple of species once thought to have gone extinct have since been rediscovered . The hairy @-@ eared dwarf lemur ( Allocebus <unk> ) was only known from five museum specimens , most collected in the late 19th century and one in 1965 . It was rediscovered in 1989 and has since been identified in five national parks , although it is very rare within its range . Likewise , the greater bamboo lemur ( Prolemur simus ) was thought to be extinct as recently as the late 1970s , but a population was located near Ranomafana National Park in the late 1980s . Historically , it had a much wider geographic distribution , shown by subfossil remains , but today it remains one of the world 's 25 most endangered primates . One distinctive morph ( possibly a species or subspecies ) of sifaka , has not been so fortunate , having been extirpated from all known localities . Unless trends change , extinctions are likely to continue . 
 Until recently , giant species of lemur existed on Madagascar . Now represented only by recent or subfossil remains , they were modern forms and are counted as part of the rich lemur diversity that evolved in isolation . Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in lemurs today . All 17 extinct lemurs were larger than the extant forms , some weighing as much as 200 kg ( 440 lb ) , and are thought to have been active during the day . Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance , they also filled ecological niches that no longer exist or are now left unoccupied . Large parts of Madagascar , which are now devoid of forests and lemurs , once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20 species covering the full range of lemur sizes .

 = 2015 Monaco Grand Prix = 
 The 2015 Monaco Grand Prix , formally known as the Grand Prix de Monaco 2015 , was a Formula One motor race that was held on 24 May 2015 at the Circuit de Monaco , a street circuit that runs through the principality of Monaco . It was the sixty @-@ second running of the race as a World Championship event , and seventy @-@ third running overall . 
 Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton entered the race with a twenty @-@ point lead over teammate and defending race winner Nico Rosberg in the Drivers ' Championship , with Mercedes having a seventy @-@ point lead over Ferrari in the Constructors ' Championship . 
 World Champion Lewis Hamilton secured his first ever Monaco pole position during Saturday 's qualifying . In the race , Nico Rosberg took his third consecutive win at Monaco , second win of the season , and the tenth of his career , while Sebastian Vettel finished second . Championship leader Hamilton , who had led for most of the race , moved from first into third place following a " pit stop misjudgement " during a late safety car period , for which his team , Mercedes , later apologised . The renewed McLaren @-@ Honda partnership scored its first points since Honda 's return to the sport . With Rosberg 's victory , he was able to reduce his deficit in the World Drivers ' Championship to ten points . 
 = = Report = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Ahead of the race weekend , Mercedes announced they had extended their contract with world champion Lewis Hamilton for three additional years , keeping him at the team until the end of the 2018 season . 
 Revisions to the Tabac corner at the harbour section of the race track meant that the drivers now entered the turn slightly earlier , shortening the track by 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) compared to previous years , and making the corner slightly tighter and slower . The corner had seen a race @-@ stopping accident involving Pastor Maldonado and Max Chilton in 2013 , leading to the changes being made . This resulted in the circuit being officially classified as a new layout . The barrier on the right of the swimming pool chicane was moved back , with new kerbs , to allow for a better view of the corner . Much of the track was resurfaced before the event . As in Australia and Singapore , the pit lane speed limit for the duration of the event was reduced to 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) , instead of the standard 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) , due to the confined nature of the circuit . The race schedule for the weekend was different in Monaco compared to the other races on the calendar . The first two free practice sessions were held on Thursday instead of Friday . 
 Tyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow @-@ marked soft compound tyre as the harder " prime " tyre and the red @-@ marked super @-@ soft compound tyre as the more elastic " option " tyre , just as they did the previous three seasons . It was the first time in the 2015 season that the super @-@ soft compound would be used at a race weekend . 
 = = = Free practice = = = 
 As per the regulations for 2015 , three practice sessions were held , two one and a half @-@ hour sessions on Thursday and another one @-@ hour session on Saturday morning . After a thunderstorm on Wednesday night , the first of the two free practice sessions held on Thursday morning , started with every driver setting their installation laps on intermediate tyres . The track soon dried up , and the cars changed to slick tyres . Nico Rosberg had an early shunt when he clipped his front wing exiting the Tabac corner though he did not sustain considerable damage to his car . The two Mercedes drivers swapped places at the top of the time sheets for most of the session , until late improvements pushed Rosberg down the order to finish ninth , more than a second off his team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton . Rookie Max Verstappen surprised the paddock by finishing second , two @-@ tenths of a second down on Hamilton . The Renault @-@ powered cars all finished within the top seven , while the Williams team ended the session in tenth and seventeenth , owing to the car not being well suited for wet and low @-@ temperature conditions . 
 The second session on Thursday afternoon saw considerably less running than the first . A red flag was shown ten minutes into practice after Roberto Merhi crashed on the exit of the tunnel . During the stoppage , rain began to fall , keeping most drivers in the garage when practice was restarted . It was not until ten minutes from the end of the session that the drivers took to the track again , but under damp conditions they managed times that were slower than the pace set at the beginning . Lewis Hamilton finished the session fastest , more than seven @-@ tenths of a second in front of his team mate . Toro Rosso confirmed their high pace with Carlos Sainz , Jr. and Max Verstappen in sixth and seventh respectively , while McLaren proved they might challenge for points as predicted , with Fernando Alonso in eighth place . 
 The third practice on Saturday morning was interrupted midway through the session when Kimi Räikkönen crashed his Ferrari at Sainte <unk> . His team mate Sebastian Vettel set the fastest lap during the session , ahead of the Mercedes ' of Rosberg and Hamilton . Hamilton reported problems with his car , believed by his race engineer to be caused by over @-@ pressured tyres . The two Renault @-@ powered teams , Red Bull and Toro Rosso , confirmed their strong pace by placing all four cars in the top ten . 
 = = = Qualifying = = = 
 Qualifying consisted of three parts , 18 , 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively , with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions . The first part ( Q1 ) saw a " a surprise casualty " when Valtteri Bottas failed to cross the line for his final lap in time , leaving him seventeenth on the grid . The two Manor Marussias finished last , as they had in every qualifying session they participated in up to that point during the 2015 season . Joining them on the sidelines were the two Saubers of Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson , split by Bottas . 
 While McLaren once again succeeded in advancing both cars into Q2 , Fernando Alonso 's car stopped in the first corner due to an electrical fault at the start of the second session , and he took no further part in qualifying . Team mate Jenson Button was more successful , missing out on Q3 when his second fast lap was interrupted by Nico Rosberg going off at Sainte <unk> . The second Williams of Felipe Massa completed a problematic Saturday for the team , claiming only 14th on the grid , while Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean also did not make it into Q3 . 
 The third part of qualifying , contested by the top ten drivers , started with drops of rain falling , meaning all drivers took to the track quickly . Sergio Pérez , who made his first Q3 appearance of the 2015 season , had only one set of super @-@ soft tyres left and finished seventh . Lewis Hamilton took an early lead with his first run and team mate Nico Rosberg was denied a chance to challenge him for pole position when he made a mistake in turn one during his second fast lap . The two Red Bulls separated the two Ferraris , leaving Kimi Räikkönen with another disappointing qualifying performance down in sixth . It was the first pole position for Hamilton in Monaco , who called it " incredibly special " . 
 Carlos Sainz , Jr . , who had qualified in eighth position , was adjudged to have missed a call to go to the weigh bridge during the first part of qualifying . Following the session , he was given a penalty which required him to start the race from the pit lane . 
 = = = Race = = = 
 At the start of the race Hamilton , Rosberg and Vettel maintained their grid positions into the first corner , while Daniil Kvyat managed to overtake team @-@ mate Daniel Ricciardo for fourth . Trying to get past Nico Hülkenberg on the inside of turn five , Fernando Alonso made contact with Hülkenberg , who hit the wall but was able to continue , though at the back of the field . Alonso was reprimanded with a five @-@ second penalty to serve at his first pit stop . Meanwhile , Felipe Massa made contact with Pastor Maldonado , damaging his front wing . Massa came into the pits for a new wing and equipped the harder tyre compound . Maldonado suffered from brake problems in the early laps , eventually retiring on lap seven . 
 By lap ten , Hamilton had built a three @-@ second lead over his teammate Rosberg , who was an additional 1 @.@ 7 seconds ahead of Vettel . While some drivers came into the pits for their first regular stop as early as lap 13 , the top runners stayed out until lap 37 , when Vettel was the first to come in , followed by Rosberg and Hamilton one lap later respectively . Following the stops , Hamilton led Rosberg by seven seconds . Max Verstappen dropped down the order when a problem at the rear of the car caused him to be stationary for 31 seconds during his stop on lap 30 . Fernando Alonso , who had been running in ninth place , retired from the race with a gearbox failure on lap 43 . By lap 45 , Hamilton had extended his lead to ten seconds , while Rosberg remained two seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel . 
 By lap 59 , Verstappen on the fast super @-@ soft tyres was chasing Lotus ' Romain Grosjean for tenth position , with Verstappen making several attempts to pass over the following laps . At the beginning of lap 64 , coming into turn one , Verstappen crashed into the back of the Lotus , sending him flying into the barriers . While he was able to walk away from the accident without injuries , a " Virtual Safety Car " condition was called by the race director to allow marshals to safely recover the damaged car . This was the first time a Virtual Safety Car had been used in Formula One . Shortly thereafter , the regular safety car was sent out on track . Lewis Hamilton , who had been leading the race by almost twenty seconds , was pitted apparently with the intention of returning him to the track ahead of his pursuers . The Mercedes <unk> crew , however , miscalculated the gap allowing Rosberg to take the lead while Hamilton emerged from the pit exit lane marginally behind Vettel who had stayed out under the safety car behind Rosberg . With the safety car coming into the pits on lap 70 of 78 , Rosberg retained the lead unchallenged going on to win the Monaco Grand Prix for a third consecutive time whereas Hamilton finished third , unable to overtake Vettel for second position . Daniel Ricciardo had also pitted under the safety car , and on fresh tyres he was able to pass Kimi Räikkönen in controversial circumstances . His teammate Kvyat then let him past in order to give him the chance to try and pass third @-@ placed Hamilton . When Ricciardo was unable to overtake , he handed fourth place back to Kvyat . Ricciardo set the fastest lap of the race in the process . Jenson Button finished eighth , scoring four championship points for himself and the McLaren team , the first points for the renewed McLaren @-@ Honda partnership since their return at the start of the 2015 season . 
 = = = Post @-@ race = = = 
 Following the race , Mercedes apologised to Hamilton for the pit call , which commentators such as <unk> 's Keith <unk> , Formula One correspondent for The Guardian Paul Weaver , and former Formula One driver David Coulthard felt cost him the victory . Team boss Toto Wolff told the press : " We got our numbers wrong . We thought we had the gap for Lewis to take fresh tyres and come back out in the lead behind the safety car , ahead of Nico and covering off any risk of another competitor taking fresh tyres . But the calculation was incorrect and he came out in third place . " Indeed , more than half of the teams pitted at least one car when the safety car was deployed , just as Hamilton did . However , he as race leader caught up with the safety car quicker and lost a considerably larger amount of time on his way into the pits , leading to him coming out behind Rosberg and Vettel . 
 During the post @-@ race press conference , Hamilton revealed the decision to pit him was made after he had voiced concern over the heat in his tyres , being under the false impression that his rivals behind had already pitted for the softer compound . When asked whether he would have full confidence in the team 's strategy decisions in the future , he answered " yes " . At the podium interviews , conducted by Martin Brundle , Rosberg admitted his victory " was just a lot of luck " and added that " Lewis drove brilliantly and he would have also deserved the win for sure " . Rosberg became the fourth driver overall , and the first since Ayrton Senna , to win the Monaco Grand Prix three times in a row . 
 Following the accident with Romain Grosjean , the race stewards handed Max Verstappen a five @-@ place grid penalty for the next race , the Canadian Grand Prix . For the first time in his Formula One career , Verstappen also had two penalty points added to his FIA Super Licence . Verstappen was criticised for his actions by fellow driver Felipe Massa , who said that he deserved the penalty . Verstappen reacted by insisting that he had done nothing wrong , instead pointing to Massa 's own accident at the 2014 Canadian Grand Prix , where Massa had crashed into the back of Sergio Pérez in similar fashion . Immediately following the race , Verstappen had accused Grosjean of " brake @-@ testing " him , a claim denied by Grosjean , who insisted that he had braked even later than the lap before . 
 The race results meant that Nico Rosberg moved closer towards his teammate 's championship lead , now ten points behind Hamilton . Sebastian Vettel followed another 18 points behind . Meanwhile , in the Constructors ' Championship , Mercedes extended their lead over Ferrari to 84 points .

 = = Cancer and death = = 
 Pausch was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent a Whipple procedure ( pancreaticoduodenectomy ) on September 19 , 2006 , in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the disease . He was told in August 2007 to expect a remaining three to six months of good health . He soon moved his family to Chesapeake , Virginia , a suburb near Norfolk , to be close to his wife 's family . On March 13 , 2008 , Pausch advocated for greater federal funding for pancreatic cancer before the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor , Health and Human Services , Education , and Related Agencies . In the week prior to this , he had been hospitalized in order to have needle aspiration of pleural effusion in his right lung . 
 On May 2 , 2008 , a positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan showed that he had very tiny ( 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) or less ) metastases in his lungs and in some of the lymph nodes in his chest . He also had metastases in his peritoneal and <unk> cavities . On June 26 , 2008 , Pausch indicated that he was considering stopping further chemotherapy because of the potential adverse side effects . He was , however , considering some immuno @-@ therapy @-@ based approaches . On July 24 , on behalf of Pausch , a friend anonymously posted a message on Pausch 's webpage stating that a biopsy had indicated that the cancer had progressed farther than had been indicated by recent PET scans and that Pausch had " taken a step down " and was " much sicker than he had been " . The friend also stated that Pausch had then enrolled in a hospice program designed to provide palliative care to those at the end of life . 
 Pausch died from pancreatic cancer at his family 's home in Chesapeake , Virginia on July 25 , 2008 , at the age of 47 . He is survived by his wife , Jai , and their three children , Dylan , Logan , and Chloe .

 Pausch delivered his " Last Lecture " , titled " Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams " , at CMU on September 18 , 2007 . He gave an abridged version of his speech on The Oprah Winfrey Show in October 2007 . The talk was modeled after an ongoing series of lectures where top academics are asked to think deeply about what matters to them , and then give a hypothetical " final talk " , with a topic such as " what wisdom would you try to impart to the world if you knew it was your last chance ? " Before speaking , Pausch received a long standing ovation from a large crowd of over 400 colleagues and students . When he motioned them to sit down , saying , " Make me earn it " , someone in the audience shouted back , " You did ! " 
 During the lecture , Pausch offered inspirational life lessons , and performed push @-@ ups on stage .

 The Public Relations Society of America ( PRSA ) is a nonprofit trade association for public relations professionals headquartered in New York City . It was founded in 1947 by combining the American Council on Public Relations and the National Association of Public Relations Councils . That year it had its first annual conference and award ceremony . In the 1950s and 1960s , the society created its code of conduct , accreditation program and a student society called the Public Relations Student Society of America . In the 1970s and 1980s , its membership attained a stronger female demographic and the society had its first female Presidents . PRSA created a definition of public relations in 1982 , which was updated with a crowd @-@ sourced version in 2011 . 
 PRSA is governed by a Leadership Assembly that consists of delegates representing its membership , a board of directors and various committees and task forces . Positions are elected and served on a volunteer basis . PRSA hosts an accreditation program , industry awards , networking events and a code of conduct . PRSA also advocates on behalf of the public relations industry for changes in education and for the credibility of the profession . 
 = = History = = 
 The Public Relations Society of America was formed in 1947 by combining the American Council on Public Relations and the National Association of Public Relations Councils . The society had its first annual conference in Philadelphia , where Richard Falk was given PRSA 's first " annual citation " for advancing the field of public relations . Several ethical violations in the field led to discussions about ethics within the society . At the 1952 annual conference , a speaker used Adolf Hitler as an example of the potential abuse of communications . The society published its first code of conduct and its first Anvil awards two years later . The code of conduct was later ratified in 1959 and again in 1963 . PRSA merged with the American Public Relations Association in 1961 and started its accreditation program for public relations professionals the next year . The Public Relations Student Society of America ( <unk> ) was created in 1967 based on suggestions by Professor Walter Seifer of Ohio State University . 
 In the 1970s to early 1980s , PRSA 's female membership base increased , coinciding with more women pursuing a career in the field . PRSA had its first female President in 1972 and a second female President in 1983 . In 1981 , 78 percent of PRSA 's student society were women , up from 38 percent in 1968 . The society grew to 9 @,@ 000 members by 1981 , up from 4 @,@ 500 members in 1960 . In 1977 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) said PRSA 's code of conduct inhibited fair competition by requiring members not to solicit clients from other members . It issued a consent order that required PRSA to remove content from its code of conduct that contained sexist language , discouraged soliciting clients from other members or encouraged price @-@ fixing activities . PRSA 's first definition of public relations was created in 1982 as " Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other . ” In 1986 , PRSA 's then President Anthony Franco resigned from his post after it was revealed he was accused of insider trading by the Securities Exchange Commission . The PRSA 's philanthropy arm , the PRSA Foundation , was founded in 1990 . 
 In 1994 O 'Dwyer from the O 'Dwyer 's PR trade journal alleged that PRSA was violating copyright laws by lending articles from USA Today , The New York Times , O 'Dwyer 's and others to members . Although O 'Dwyer has been a critic of PRSA since the 1970s , this is often considered the beginning of a long @-@ term dispute between PRSA and O 'Dwyer that PR News described as a " never @-@ ending back @-@ and @-@ forth . " In 1996 and 2011 O 'Dwyer criticized PRSA on issues such as financial transparency , auditing and spending in the context of proposed increases in membership dues . PRSA said the increases were caused by an increase in services to members . 
 In 2000 , PRSA and the Institute of Public Relations signed a mutual declaration saying the two would work together in areas like ethics , education , accreditation , professional development and new media . The society started two efforts to revise its definition of public relations in 2003 and 2007 , but neither moved forward . In November 2011 , PRSA led an initiative called Public Relations Defined , in order to create a crowd @-@ sourced definition of public relations . 927 submissions were made on PRSA 's website filling in the blanks to the statement : " Public relations ( does what ) with or for ( whom ) to ( do what ) for ( what purpose ) . ” The winning definition was : " a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organisations and their bodies . " According to the Chartered Institute of Public Relations ( CIPR ) " reactions to the new PRSA definition were mixed and views vigorously debated . " 
 In 2011 PRSA publicized accusations that O 'Dwyer had been eavesdropping on PRSA 's conference calls . Later that year PRSA started refusing O 'Dwyer entrance to their events and sent a 23 @-@ page letter to O 'Dwyer describing his behavior as disruptive and unethical . The National Press Club tried to negotiate his entrance unsuccessfully . 
 = = Organization = = 
 PRSA is organized as a 501 ( c ) ( 6 ) not @-@ for @-@ profit organization and governed by a set of bylaws . A Chair is nominated each year and elected based on a vote of the Leadership Assembly . The Leadership Assembly consists of one delegate for every 100 members , as well as anyone that holds an elected office . Elected positions within PRSA are held on a volunteer @-@ basis . A Board of Directors can propose membership fee changes that must be approved by the assembly . The board has the authority to create or dissolve task forces and committees as well as revoke or reward membership status . PRSA 's Board of Ethics and Professional Standards and the Universal Accreditation Board make recommendations on the code of conduct and accreditation programs respectively . PRSA has more than 100 chapters in ten districts , 300 student chapters and 14 interest groups . 
 Since the 1970s , the PRSA had restricted the right to sit in the group 's national assembly or to seek election to the national board to those possessing an APR certification . The requirement for the assembly was dropped in 2004 , but was maintained for those seeking board membership . In 2010 a revolt led by Richard Edelman and a group calling itself " the Committee for a Democratic PRSA " called for the restriction to be scrapped . The attempt to overturn the rule was defeated in a vote during that year 's session of the assembly . In 2003 a proposal to amend the society 's bylaws to allow non @-@ accredited professionals to run for PRSA 's offices was defeated , but the motion passed the following year .

 PRSA hosts an accreditation program called APR ( accreditation in public relations ) that evaluates a PR professional in four categories : research , planning , implementation and evaluation . Accreditation is usually granted to candidates with five to seven years of experience upon completion of written and oral examinations . About 20 percent of PRSA 's members are accredited . PRSA hosts the Anvil awards , which are issued based on four components : research , planning , execution and evaluation . The Gold Anvil is awarded to individuals . The Silver Anvil is awarded for strategy and the Bronze for tactics . It also issues awards such as Grand Gold Pick , Rookie of the Year , Lifetime Achievement and PR person of the year . 
 PRSA 's Public Relations Journal was published from October 1945 to 1995 . Its original mission statement was " to carry articles that deal with fundamental public relations problems , as they currently press for solution . " The journal was comparable to a text @-@ heavy academic periodical . PRSA still publishes The Strategist and Tactics . The Strategist is a quarterly glossy magazine intended for executives , while Tactics is a monthly news tabloid . 
 The Public Relations Society of America publishes a code of ethics . Members that violate the code may have their membership revoked , usually under its mandate that members " not engage in any practice which tends to corrupt the integrity of channels of public communication " and that members act " in accord with public welfare . " The code also expects PRSA members to identify the source of their communications , avoid derogatory methods and avoid abusing insider information . According to the code of conduct , members should " protect and advance the free flow of accurate and truthful information ; foster informed decision @-@ making through open communication ... and work to strengthen the public 's trust in the profession . " The code states that members " adhere to the highest standards of accuracy and truth . " A story in CBS criticized the code : " Show me a PR person who is ' accurate ' and ' truthful , ' and I 'll show you a PR person who is unemployed . " The code of ethics has been revised in 1954 , 1959 , 1963 , 1977 , 1983 , 1988 and 2000 .

 The Public Relations Society of America and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication commissioned studies in 1975 and 1987 on the state of public relations in education . They found that too many classes were taught by educators with little or no experience in the field and that most didn 't have a post @-@ graduate degree . Several standards in education were established by the studies , including that 75 percent of coursework for PR professionals be outside the major . In 1991 , PRSA hosted a Task Force on the Structure and Role on Public Relations , which found that public relations teachers still lacked practical experience . In 1993 PRSA published a Professional Career Guide , which classified skills and knowledge that were needed at five different levels of someone 's career . PRSA also advocates that MBA programs include communications programs , so business executives will be more prepared for a crisis . 
 PRSA advocates for the trust , credibility and respect of public relations as a profession , believing that PR can facilitate open communication that allows for an informed public and supports the democratic process . In 1999 , a National Credibility Index from PRSA found that PR professionals were among the least credible of professions as a spokesperson . The PRSA objected to the actions of the <unk> Group in 2011 , when the PR firm threatened to blacklist media that gave Duke Nukem negative reviews . In 2012 a Senate subcommittee investigated the communications and advertising spend of eleven government agencies . PRSA opposed the investigation , presenting that the effort dismissed the value of public relations in government .

 " Thumbelina " ( Danish : Tommelise ) is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen first published by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen , Denmark with " The Naughty Boy " and " The Traveling Companion " in the second installment of Fairy Tales Told for Children . " Thumbelina " is about a tiny girl and her adventures with <unk> and marriage @-@ minded toads , moles , and cockchafers . She successfully avoids their intentions before falling in love with a flower @-@ fairy prince just her size . 
 " Thumbelina " is chiefly Andersen 's invention , though he did take inspiration from tales of miniature people such as " Tom Thumb " . " Thumbelina " was published as one of a series of seven fairy tales in 1835 which were not well received by the Danish critics who disliked their informal style and their lack of morals . One critic , however , applauded " Thumbelina " . The earliest English translation of " Thumbelina " is dated 1846 . The tale has been adapted to various media including television drama and animated film . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the first English translation of 1847 by Mary Howitt , the tale opens with a beggar woman giving a peasant 's wife a <unk> in exchange for food . Once planted , a tiny girl , Thumbelina ( Tommelise ) , emerges from its flower . One night , Thumbelina , asleep in her walnut @-@ shell cradle , is carried off by a toad who wants the miniature maiden as a bride for her son . With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly , Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son , and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag beetle who later discards her when his friends reject her company . 
 Thumbelina tries to protect herself from the elements , but when winter comes , she is in desperate straits . She is finally given shelter by an old field mouse and tends her dwelling in gratitude . The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor , a mole , but Thumbelina finds repulsive the prospect of being married to such a creature because he spent all his days underground and never saw the sun or sky . The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage , saying the mole is a good match for her , and does not listen to her protests . 
 At the last minute , Thumbelina escapes the situation by fleeing to a far land with a swallow she nursed back to health during the winter . In a sunny field of flowers , Thumbelina meets a tiny flower @-@ fairy prince just her size and to her liking , and they wed . She receives a pair of wings to accompany her husband on his travels from flower to flower , and a new name , Maia . 
 In Hans Christian Andersen 's version of the story , a bluebird had been viewing Thumbelina 's story since the beginning and had been in love with her since . In the end , the bird is heartbroken once Thumbelina marries the flower @-@ fairy prince , and flies off eventually arriving at a small house . There , he tells Thumbelina 's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself and chronicles the story in a book . 
 = = Background = = 
 Hans Christian Andersen was born in Odense , Denmark on 2 April 1805 to Hans Andersen , a shoemaker , and Anne Marie <unk> . An only and a spoiled child , Andersen shared a love of literature with his father who read him The Arabian Nights and the fables of Jean de la Fontaine . Together , they constructed panoramas , pop @-@ up pictures , and toy theatres , and took long jaunts into the countryside . 
 Andersen 's father died in 1816 , and from then on , Andersen was left to his own devices . In order to escape his poor , illiterate mother , he promoted his artistic inclinations and courted the cultured middle class of Odense , singing and reciting in their drawing @-@ rooms . On 4 September 1819 , the fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Andersen left Odense for Copenhagen with the few savings he had acquired from his performances , a letter of reference to the ballerina Madame Schall , and youthful dreams and intentions of becoming a poet or an actor . 
 After three years of rejections and disappointments , he finally found a patron in Jonas Collin , the director of the Royal Theatre , who , believing in the boy 's potential , secured funds from the king to send Andersen to a grammar school in Slagelse , a provincial town in west Zealand , with the expectation that the boy would continue his education at Copenhagen University at the appropriate time . 
 At Slagelse , Andersen fell under the tutelage of Simon Meisling , a short , stout , balding thirty @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old classicist and translator of Virgil 's Aeneid . Andersen was not the quickest student in the class and was given generous doses of Meisling 's contempt . " You 're a stupid boy who will never make it , " Meisling told him . Meisling is believed to be the model for the learned mole in " Thumbelina " . 
 Fairy tale and folklorists Iona and Peter Opie have proposed the tale as a " distant tribute " to Andersen 's confidante , Henriette Wulff , the small , frail , hunchbacked daughter of the Danish translator of Shakespeare who loved Andersen as Thumbelina loves the swallow ; however , no written evidence exists to support the theory . 
 = = Publication and critical reception = = 
 Andersen published two installments of his first collection of Fairy Tales Told for Children in 1835 , the first in May and the second in December . " Thumbelina " was first published in the December installment by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen . " Thumbelina " was the first tale in the booklet which included two other tales : " The Naughty Boy " and " The Traveling Companion " . The story was republished in collected editions of Andersen 's works in 1850 and 1862 . 
 The first reviews of the seven tales of 1835 did not appear until 1836 and the Danish critics were not enthusiastic . The informal , chatty style of the tales and their lack of morals were considered inappropriate in children ’ s literature . One critic however acknowledged " Thumbelina " to be “ the most delightful fairy tale you could wish for . ” 
 The critics offered Andersen no further encouragement . One literary journal never mentioned the tales at all while another advised Andersen not to waste his time writing fairy tales . One critic stated that Andersen " lacked the usual form of that kind of poetry [ ... ] and would not study models " . Andersen felt he was working against their preconceived notions of what a fairy tale should be , and returned to novel @-@ writing , believing it was his true calling . The critical reaction to the 1835 tales was so harsh that he waited an entire year before publishing " The Little Mermaid " and " The Emperor 's New Clothes " in the third and final installment of Fairy Tales Told for Children . 
 = = English translations = = 
 Mary Howitt was the first to translate " Tommelise " into English and published it as " Thumbelina " in Wonderful Stories for Children in 1846 . However , she did not approve of the opening scene with the witch , and , instead , had the childless woman provide bread and milk to a hungry beggar woman who then rewarded her hostess with a <unk> . 
 Charles Boner also translated the tale in 1846 as " Little Ellie " while Madame de Chatelain dubbed the child ' Little <unk> ' in her 1852 translation . The editor of The Child 's Own Book ( 1853 ) called the child throughout , ' Little Maja ' . H. W. <unk> was probably the translator responsible for the name , ' Thumbelina ' . His widely published volumes of Andersen 's tales appeared in 1864 and 1866 . Mrs. H.B. <unk> translated the name as ' Little Tiny ' in the late @-@ nineteenth century . 
 In the twentieth century , Erik Christian Haugaard translated the name as ' <unk> ' in 1974 , and Jeffrey and Diane Crone Frank translated the name as ' <unk> ' in 2005 . Modern English translations of " Thumbelina " are found in the six @-@ volume complete edition of Andersen 's tales from the 1940s by Jean Hersholt , and Erik Christian Haugaard ’ s translation of the complete tales in 1974 . 
 = = Commentaries = = 
 For fairy tale researchers and folklorists Iona and Peter Opie , " Thumbelina " is an adventure story from the feminine point of view with its moral being people are happiest with their own kind . They point out that Thumbelina is a passive character , the victim of circumstances whereas her male counterpart Tom Thumb ( one of the tale ’ s inspirations ) is an active character , makes himself felt , and exerts himself . 
 Folklorist Maria Tatar sees “ Thumbelina ” as a runaway bride story and notes that it has been viewed as an allegory about arranged marriages , and a fable about being true to one ’ s heart that upholds the traditional notion that the love of a prince is to be valued above all else . She points out that in Hindu belief , a thumb @-@ sized being known as the innermost self or soul dwells in the heart of all beings , human or animal , and that the concept may have migrated to European folklore and taken form as Tom Thumb and Thumbelina , both of whom seek transfiguration and redemption . She detects parallels between Andersen ’ s tale and the Greek myth of Demeter and her daughter , Persephone , and , notwithstanding the pagan associations and allusions in the tale , notes that " Thumbelina " repeatedly refers to Christ ‘ s suffering and resurrection , and the Christian concept of salvation . 
 Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager indicates that “ Thumbelina ” was the first of Andersen 's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different , and , as a result of being different , becomes the object of mockery . It was also the first of Andersen 's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen ’ s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble . 
 Roger Sale believes Andersen expressed his feelings of social and sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds . The Little Mermaid , for example , has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright . In “ Thumbelina ” , Andersen suggests the toad , the beetle , and the mole are Thumbelina ’ s inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior . Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply different . He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority . 
 Jacqueline Banerjee views the tale as a failure story . “ Not surprisingly , “ she writes , “ ” Thumbelina “ is now often read as a story of specifically female empowerment . “ Susie Stephens believes Thumbelina herself is a grotesque , and observes that “ the grotesque in children ’ s literature is [ ... ] a necessary and beneficial component that enhances the psychological welfare of the young reader “ . Children are attracted to the cathartic qualities of the grotesque , she suggests . Sidney Rosenblatt in his essay " Thumbelina and the Development of Female Sexuality " believes the tale may be analyzed , from the perspective of Freudian psychoanalysis , as the story of female masturbation . Thumbelina herself , he posits , could symbolize the clitoris , her rose petal <unk> the labia , the white butterfly " the budding genitals " , and the mole and the prince the anal and vaginal openings respectively .

 " The Rain King " is the eighth episode of the sixth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on January 10 , 1999 . " The Rain King " was written by Jeffrey Bell and directed by Kim Manners . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " The Rain King " earned a Nielsen household rating of 12 @.@ 5 , being watched by 21 @.@ 2 million people in its initial broadcast . Critical reception to the episode was mostly mixed , with results ranging from negative to positive . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In the episode , Mulder and Scully are asked to investigate the strange weather phenomena occurring in a small town . They find a man , Daryl Mootz , who claims to produce the rain . 
 " The Rain King " was written by Jeffrey Bell , his first script for the show . The episode was originally purchased as a freelance script , but Bell was later hired on as a full @-@ time writer . Grapevine , Piru , and Culver City , California stood in for the fictional town of Kroner , Kansas during filming . The episode required several elaborate special effect sequences to create heart @-@ shaped hail as well as to simulate a flying cow . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On Valentine 's Day in Kroner , Kansas , Sheila Fontaine and Daryl Mootz get into an argument . Fontaine had put their engagement news in the paper , but Mootz had wanted to keep it a secret for as long as the drought makes business poor . After the argument , Mootz goes for a drunken drive but crashes after heart @-@ shaped hailstones wreck his car . 
 Six months later , Mulder and Scully arrive in Kroner by request of the mayor . For several months a terrible drought has plagued the region . However , Mootz , now styling himself as " The Rain King " , seems to have the power to control the weather . For a hefty sum , he is able to make it rain . Mulder and Scully obtain a client list and head to the local television station to talk to the weatherman , Holman Hardt . Hardt admits that while Mootz 's talents are odd , he appears to truly have the power to control the weather . Mulder and Scully , both skeptical , attend one of Mootz 's rituals . Despite their preconceived notions , Mulder and Scully witness Mootz bring rain to a dry farm . 
 Mulder and Scully check into a motel , where a cow crashes through the roof of Mulder 's room . After the incident , a tearful Sheila confesses that the cow might have been her fault . She admits that she 's experienced a strange history of weather @-@ related phenomena , and believes that she can unconsciously control the weather . Mulder assures her otherwise . During the conversation , Hardt over @-@ hears that Mootz was drunk the night of the accident , and is relieved . Immediately , Mootz 's rain powers seem to disappear . 
 It is revealed that Holman Hardt is actually the one controlling the weather . All of the bizarre weather was the side @-@ effect of his long @-@ silent love for Sheila . He felt guilty that his weather @-@ related problem caused Mootz to crash his car , so he would cause it to rain for Mootz . Once he realized Mootz had been drunk the night of the accident , however , he stopped . Unfortunately , Mulder begins to unintentionally attract Sheila , resulting in a massive thunderstorm that materializes due to the meteorologist 's emotions . At the town 's high school reunion , however , Hardt admits his love for Sheila , who accepts him . The storm stops , and Hardt and Sheila live happily ever after .

 = = = Writing = = = 
 " The Rain King " was the first episode written by then @-@ new X @-@ Files writer Jeffrey Bell . Bell , who never intended to work in television , sent the production staff three script ideas because he was a fan of the show . The staff agreed to buy one — which eventually became " The Rain King " — as a freelance script . Bell worked with Frank Spotnitz , John Shiban , and Vince Gilligan to edit the script by " boarding " it , a process where note cards are used to flesh out the story . The group of men pitched the story idea to series creator Chris Carter in August , and Bell was later hired as a show writer . 
 The script went through considerable changes . Bell was unaware that his character of Daryl Mootz would " steal the show " . In addition , the relationship between Holman and the FBI agents grew stronger in subsequent drafts . In the final draft , Bell attempted to parallel the emotional state of Mulder and Scully with Hardt . He said , " Here you have a guy who 's affecting the weather because he 's repressing his emotions [ ... ] and who better to help him than two people whose emotions are repressed and never express their feelings for each other ? " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The scene in which Daryl Mootz crashes his car after being hit with heart @-@ shaped hail was filmed on a " lonely road " near Grapevine , California . The road was so seldom used that the Caltrans highway officials reportedly had no problem shutting down the entire road for the crew to film the scene . Director Kim Manners was very happy with the way the filming turned out , although he did note that the hardest shot to get was of the car crashing into the pole , because the car kept correcting itself and crashing at an undesired angle . 
 Ilt Jones , the series ' location manager , decided to use Piru , California as a stand @-@ in for Kroner , Kansas — a fictitious city named after Bell 's college roommate . " How the Ghosts Stole Christmas " would later be filmed in the same town . The climactic scenes in Kroner 's high school were filmed at an actual abandoned high school in Culver City , California . Corey Kaplan and her art team were tasked with turning the derelict gym into a believable reunion set . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 Property master Tom Day and costume designer Christine Peters were tasked with making a one @-@ legged version of Clayton Rohner , who portrayed Mootz . Day constructed a fake prosthetic leg and Peters created a harness that pulled Rohner 's actual leg out of the camera 's sight . The harness was later described as " painful " . 
 The scene that featured a cow crashing through Mulder 's roof was elaborately orchestrated . Initially , Jones approached the owner of a motel called the Sierra <unk> Motel and requested that it be used in the episode . A deal was made that stated that the production staff could cut a hole in the roof for the episode in exchange for a brand @-@ new roof after the episode was filmed . Duke <unk> , The X @-@ Files construction coordinator , later said that the " fun part " was " calling local roofers and explaining just what kind of damage they 'd be repairing for us " . 
 Special effects producer Bill Millar acquired several cows , put them in a field , and photographed them for reference . Using digital technology he animated one of the cows to create the effect of it being sucked upwards . Finally , a " cow puppet " was dropped on a re @-@ creation of Mulder 's motel room at Fox Studios . Millar noticed that the cow puppet 's color was different than his computer generated cow , forcing him to quickly change the color . Kim Manners later stated that his biggest regret with the episode is that he did not have David Duchovny respond " Got milk ? " after the cow crashed through his roof .

 " The Rain King " premiered on the Fox network on January 10 , 1999 . Following its initial American broadcast , the episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 12 @.@ 5 , with an 18 share — meaning that roughly 12 @.@ 5 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 18 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . It was viewed by 21 @.@ 20 million viewers . " The Rain King " was both the highest rated episode of Season 6 and the last episode of The X @-@ Files to be viewed by more than 20 million viewers . The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on April 25 , 1999 and received 0 @.@ 75 million viewers , making it the third most watched episode that week . Fox promoted the episode with the tagline " Mulder 's been abducted , infected , and discredited . Tonight , he faces his greatest peril ever ... a woman in love . " 
 Critical reception was mostly mixed , with results ranging from negative to positive . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examination : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 – 9 of the X @-@ Files wrote positively of the episode , saying , " ' The Rain King ' was cute . Very cute . [ … ] And yet I never found myself suffering from cuteness overload . In fact , I laughed and smiled the entire way through . " Starpulse named " The Rain King " as the ninth best X @-@ Files episode and praised the lighter approach to the paranormal , saying that the episode was an " ingenious way to use the paranormal motif of the show for something other than thrills " . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B + " grade . Despite criticizing the show for " filming in the land of sunshine and lemon drops " and " border [ ing ] on that overly twee independent movie vibe " , Handlen noted that " the episode ’ s essential sweetness has enough snarky asides from our heroes [ … ] that it never goes completely off the rails . " He did , however , note that the episode 's placement , after a string of several humorous episodes , hurt its reception ; he argued that , had it appeared in an earlier , darker season , the entry would now be viewed as " a cock @-@ eyed classic " . 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , gave the episode a mixed review and rated the episode three out of five . The two praised the scene featuring the cow getting sucked up by the tornado , calling it " really , very funny " and " comic genius " , but noted that " a romantic comedy cannot work by flying cows alone . " Shearman and Pearson cited casting flaws as to why the episodes as not able to live up to its potential . Other reviews were more negative . In a review of the seventh season episode " Brand X " , Sarah <unk> from 11th Hour Magazine cited " The Rain King " as one of the worst episodes of The X @-@ Files . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four . Vitaris heavily criticized the " flying cow " scene — noting that the scene was both " poorly executed " and " offensive " for turning the death of a creature into a joke — as well as the final scene , which , according to her , featured a " false pastel sky " . Andy Meisler , in The End and the Beginning noted that the episode was poorly received by fans on the Internet .

 Blair Anderson Wark , VC , DSO ( 27 July 1894 – 13 June 1941 ) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest decoration for gallantry " in the face of the enemy " that can be awarded to members of the British and other Commonwealth armed forces . A quantity surveyor and member of the Citizens Military Force , Wark enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 5 August 1915 , for service in the First World War . After initially being employed in the defence of the Suez Canal , his battalion was shipped to the Western Front ; it was here that Wark would be twice decorated for his bravery and leadership . Having received the Distinguished Service Order in 1917 for his actions at the Battle of Polygon Wood , Wark was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1918 for his leadership and gallantry when in temporary command of his battalion over a three @-@ day period , while conducting operations against the Hindenburg Line . 
 Returning to Australia after the war , Wark resumed work as a quantity surveyor and established his own business . A respected member of Australian society , he held several positions and directorships in various companies and charities , before re @-@ enlisting for service in the Second World War . Promoted to lieutenant colonel , Wark assumed command of the 1st Battalion ( City of Sydney 's Own Regiment ) , but died suddenly at Puckapunyal Camp , Victoria , of coronary heart disease at the age of 46 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Wark was born in Bathurst , New South Wales , on 27 July 1894 , the fourth child of Alexander Wark , a gas engineer from Scotland , and his native @-@ born wife Blanche Adelaide Maria ( née Forde ) . He was educated at Fairleigh Grammar School , Bathurst , and St. Leonard 's Superior Public School before attending Sydney Technical College , where he studied quantity surveying . 
 In the twelve months prior to July 1912 , Wark was a senior cadet in the Australian Army Cadets , rising to the rank of sergeant within his unit . During this time , he was working as a quantity surveyor before he enlisted in the 18th North Sydney Infantry , Citizen Military Force . Promoted to corporal in early 1913 , he received a commission as a second lieutenant on 16 August , and for the subsequent year was assigned to full @-@ time defence duties in the port of Sydney .

 On 5 August 1915 , Wark enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force , and was posted as a lieutenant to C Company of the newly raised 30th Battalion . He proceeded to the Sydney suburb of Liverpool , where he attended an infantry school before training at the Royal Military College , Duntroon . On 9 November , the 30th Battalion embarked for Egypt aboard the troopship HMAT <unk> <unk> . Upon arrival in December , the battalion was tasked with the defence of the Suez Canal where , on 20 February 1916 , Wark was promoted to captain . 
 In June 1916 , the battalion departed from Alexandria to join the British Expeditionary Force in France for service on the Western Front ; they arrived at Marseilles on 23 June . The 30th Battalion 's first major action began with the outbreak of the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916 . The unit was originally designated with providing carrying parties for supplies and ammunition during the battle , but was subsequently pulled into the fighting . Wark commanded a company during the action , until being evacuated to the 7th Stationary Hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg . He was transferred to the 3rd London General Hospital in England three days later , and moved again to the 5th Australian Auxiliary Hospital , <unk> House , Welwyn , on 7 August . Recovered by September , Wark was discharged and granted leave before returning to France and the 30th Battalion later that month . 
 On 9 October 1916 , Wark was attached to the 32nd Battalion , a position that became permanent on 18 November . The 32nd Battalion saw no major offensive action for the remainder of the year , and on 2 January 1917 , Wark gained admission to the Army Infantry School . By February he was back with the 32nd Battalion , and took part in actions at <unk> Trench during March . For these , and further actions at Fromelles , Wark was recommended for the Distinguished Service Order , but the award was never made . He was promoted to major on 27 April , and in June was granted six days of leave to Paris . 
 In late September and early October , Wark commanded a company in the Ypres sector of Belgium during the Battle of Polygon Wood . On 29 September — the first day of the battle — Wark 's men successfully repelled the leading waves of a German counter @-@ attack and , with artillery support , drove off the remainder . Over the following three days , his constant patrolling and personal reconnaissance of the German positions enabled him to ascertain when they were massing for further counter @-@ attacks ; on one occasion he dispersed the assembling German troops with rifle fire and grenades . For his actions during the battle , Wark was awarded the Distinguished Service Order , the details of which were published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 3 June 1918 . 
 Granted sixteen days leave to the United Kingdom from 3 November , Wark was selected for a senior officers ' course at Aldershot , England , in January 1918 . On graduation he rejoined the 32nd Battalion in March as its second @-@ in @-@ command , and was Mentioned in the Despatches of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig on 7 April . Throughout June and July , Wark temporarily commanded the 32nd Battalion , which had played little part in the German Spring Offensive . The battalion took part in the Battle of Amiens on 8 August , and " was subsequently involved in the operations that continued to press the retreating Germans through August and into September " .

 From 29 September to 1 October 1918 , Wark assumed temporary command of the 32nd Battalion , leading the unit in the 5th Division 's attack against the Hindenburg Line at Bellicourt , and the subsequent advance through Nauroy , Etricourt , Magny La Fosse and Joncourt . This series of battles became the 32nd Battalion 's final actions for the war , and it was during this period that Wark earned his Victoria Cross . 
 The 32nd Battalion was to commence its attack at Bellicourt at 09 : 00 on 29 September , and move south through the village . Due to mist and smoke from a preceding artillery barrage , visibility was poor . When the advance was held up by two German machine guns , Wark ordered a tank to neutralise them . On reaching the southern end of St Quentin Canal tunnel , Wark came across two hundred troops of the American 117th Infantry Regiment who appeared to be leaderless , and attached them to his own command . A short time later , with visibility still poor , he appropriated armoured reinforcements and began an advance on the village of Nauroy . As the fog began to lift , Wark organised his troops for an attack on the village from a southerly direction . By 11 : 30 , the battalion had taken the village , along with forty Germans as prisoners of war . 
 Shortly afterwards , Wark observed a battery of German 77 mm guns firing on his rear companies , causing heavy casualties . Collecting a party of his men , he rushed the battery and succeeded in capturing four guns in conjunction with ten crewmen . With only two men , he pushed forward and surprised fifty Germans near Magny @-@ la @-@ Fosse who subsequently surrendered . At 15 : 00 , he halted his battalion near Joncourt , and sent out patrols which found the town still occupied by enemy forces . The 32nd Battalion responded by withdrawing slightly and strengthening its line . At 17 : 30 , the Germans launched a counter @-@ attack that was repulsed with the assistance of the 31st Battalion , together with some men from the 46th Infantry Division . 
 At 07 : 00 the next day , the 32nd Battalion attacked once more , advancing 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 yd ) to a point just north of Etricourt . Under heavy shelling and machine gun fire , they established a line between Joncourt and Etricourt . On 1 October , at 06 : 00 , with a company attached from the 30th Battalion , the 32nd Battalion launched an attack that cut through Joncourt . Leading from the front , Wark dashed forward and silenced machine guns that were causing heavy casualties ; this enabled the 5th Division to complete its task of forcing through to the Beaurevoir Line . 
 The full citation for Wark 's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette on 26 December 1918 , reading : 
 War Office , 26th December , 1918 
 His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers , N.C.O. ' s and Men : — 
 Maj. Blair Anderson Wark , D.S.O. , 32nd Bn . , A.I.F. 
 For most conspicuous bravery , initiative and control during the period 29th <unk> to 1st Oct. 1918 , in the operations against the Hindenburg Line at Bellicourt and the advance through Nauroy , Etricourt , Magny La Fosse and Joncourt . 
 On 29th Sept . , after personal reconnaissance under heavy fire , he led his command forward at a critical period and restored the situation . Moving fearlessly at the head of , and at times far in advance of , his troops , he cheered his men on through Nauroy , thence towards Etricourt . Still leading his assaulting companies , he observed a battery of <unk> guns firing on his rear companies and causing heavy casualties . Collecting a few of his men , he rushed the battery , capturing four guns and ten of the crew . Then moving rapidly forward with only two <unk> , he surprised and captured fifty Germans near Magny La Fosse . 
 On 1st Oct. , 1918 , he again showed fearless leading and gallantry in attack , and without hesitation and regardless of personal risk dashed forward and silenced machine guns which were causing heavy casualties . 
 Throughout he displayed the greatest courage , skilful leading and devotion to duty , and his work was invaluable . 
 The 32nd Battalion was resting and retraining away from the frontline when the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918 . On 5 January 1919 , Wark was granted leave to the United Kingdom , where he accepted his Victoria Cross from King George V on 13 February . Returning to his unit six days later , Wark was then assigned to the 30th Battalion , and sent back to England in preparation for demobilisation . On 31 May 1919 , Wark married Phyllis <unk> Munro at St George 's Parish Church , Worthing , Sussex ; ten days later , he boarded HT Port Lyttleton to return to Australia , where he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 28 September 1919 . Two of Wark 's brothers also served in the First World War , both in the 56th Battalion ; Alexander was a sergeant , while Keith , a recipient of the Distinguished Conduct Medal , rose to the rank of lieutenant . 
 = = Later life = = 
 On demobilisation Wark resumed business as a quantity surveyor in Sydney , later becoming a principal of Thompson & Wark , quantity surveyors . In June 1920 , he was in charge of ten fellow Victoria Cross recipients when they were introduced to the Prince of Wales at Government House , during the latter 's visit to Australia . Wark became a respected member of Australian society , holding several honorary public positions , including director of the Royal North Shore Hospital , life governor of the New South Wales Benevolent Society , and a councillor of the National Roads and Motorists ' Association of New South Wales . He was a committee member of the Hawkesbury River Race Club , as well as holding directorships in various insurance and petroleum companies . 
 In 1922 , Wark and Phyllis divorced ; five years later , on 10 December 1927 , he married Catherine Mary Davis at St Stephen 's Presbyterian Church , Sydney . The pair later had one son and two daughters . On 17 April 1940 , Wark returned to active duty in the Second World War , and was appointed to the 1st Battalion ( City of Sydney 's Own Regiment ) as a major . On 26 July , he was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the battalion . While bivouacked at Puckapunyal Camp , Victoria , he died suddenly of coronary heart disease on 13 June 1941 . The medical officer attending later concluded : " The cause of death in my opinion was angina pectoris , the fatal attack having been brought on by physical exertion during a night exercise under very cold conditions . " He was cremated on 16 June at Eastern Suburbs Crematorium , Sydney , after a full military funeral , and his ashes were interred at Woronora Cemetery , Sydney . Wark 's Victoria Cross is currently on display at the Queensland Museum , South Bank .

 Series co @-@ creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk began working on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production . Murphy wanted to do the opposite of what he 'd done previously and thus began his work on the series . He stated : " We 're doing some squeaky clean , sweet , optimistic , non @-@ cynical piece , I wanted to do something that sorta tapped into the different side of my personality . " Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre , stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers . He said : " You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards . " The dark tone of the series was influenced by the 1970s ABC soap opera Dark Shadows , which Murphy 's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up . In addition , the series draws inspiration from classic horror films such as Roman Polanski 's Rosemary 's Baby and Stanley Kubrick 's The Shining . 
 In February 2011 , FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Murphy and Falchuk , with both as episode writers and Murphy as director . Dante Di Loreto was announced as executive producer . Production on the series began in April 2011 . On July 18 , 2011 , FX officially announced the project had been picked up to series . On August 3 , 2011 , it was announced that Tim Minear , Jennifer Salt , James Wong and Jessica Sharzer had joined the series as writers . 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 Casting announcements began in March 2011 , with Connie Britton first to be cast , portraying female lead Vivien Harmon . Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien . When Ryan Murphy presented the role to her he said : " This is something we 've never seen you do before . It will be turning what you 've just been doing on its ear . " She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately decided to take the part . Denis O 'Hare joined the cast in late March as Larry Harvey . Jessica Lange joined the cast in April as Constance , marking her first regular role on television . Lange was attracted to the role because it didn 't require a 22 episode commitment . " That was huge for me ! " she said . " I wasn 't about to commit to , you know , six months . It was cable , rather than network ... I 've been offered network [ shows ] before , and determined not to do it , just because I can 't make that kind of time commitment . " 
 Dylan McDermott was cast as the lead , Ben Harmon , in late April 2011 . His character was initially described as " a handsome and masculine but sensitive therapist who loves his family but has hurt his wife . " McDermott stated that he wanted to do the role to break away from his previous role as Bobby Donnell in the ABC series The Practice . " This was exactly why I wanted to do this show – to change it up and do a different kind of character , " he said . " People think of me as the guy from The Practice ... I wanted to turn that [ notion ] on its head and hopefully I 'm doing that [ with this show ] . " 
 In May 2011 , Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters were the last lead actors to be cast , portraying Violet Harmon and Tate Langdon , respectively . Farmiga said that she loved Violet " immediately " and that " she had spunk to her , she had attitude . " Ryan Murphy has described Tate as the " true monster " of the series , adding : " To Evan 's great credit and the credit of the writers , I think Evan 's done an amazingly difficult job making a monster sympathetic . " 
 The pilot episode was shot on location in a house in Country Club Park , Los Angeles , California , which serves as the haunted house and crime scene in the series . Designed and built around 1908 by Alfred Rosenheim , the president of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of Architects , the Tudor or Collegiate Gothic @-@ style single family home was previously used as a convent .

 Ultime grida dalla savana ( 1975 ) ( English : Final Cry of the Savanna ) , also known as La Grande caccia and by its English title Savage Man Savage Beast , is a Mondo documentary directed by Antonio Climati and Mario Morra . Filmed all around the world , its central theme focuses on hunting and the interaction between man and animal . More specifically , the film documents various forms of hunting that can be found in the world and how humans and animals can both become the hunter or prey . Like many Mondo films , the filmmakers claim to document real , bizarre and violent behavior and customs , although some scenes were actually staged . It is narrated by Italian novelist Alberto Moravia . 
 This was the first film of Climati 's and Morra 's Savage Trilogy , which also includes Savana violenta ( This Violent World ) and Dolce e selvaggio ( Sweet and Savage ) . The best known film of the trilogy , Ultime grida dalla savana became influential in exploitation cinema by use of cinematographic techniques that were repeated in numerous subsequent Mondo films . Two scenes in particular , a lion attack on a tourist in Namibia and the murder of an indigenous man by a group of mercenaries in South America , have gained notoriety as genuine footage of human death . The film also sparked a rivalry between the team of Climati and Morra and the brothers Alfredo and Angelo Castiglioni . These two teams became the forerunners of the second generation of Mondo cinema . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The film is a depiction of various scenes , usually violent or bizarre , that somehow relate to hunting . Each scenario is presented one after the other with little regard for narrative continuity . The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive . The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag , which he ultimately shoots , kills , and beheads . Afterwards , one of the numerous scenes of anti @-@ hunting gatherings is shown , this one in Cape Cod . The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting , where a monkey is killed by a leopard , and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda . The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa . Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs . Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game , including antelope , buffalo , and elephants , in the savanna . Religious ceremonies are also shown , where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope , and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals . Lastly , two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post @-@ mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead . 
 Other hunting traditions then follow , again rooted in religion . The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act in which they copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt , and a stag hunt in France , rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls , is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place , during which the hunters and dogs chase and ultimately kill a fleeing stag . In a fox hunt , the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat . Their efforts are then connected to species conservation , and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation , Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo . A collage of other conservation efforts is shown , including the tagging of white rhinoceroses , grizzly bears and elephants , which are shot with morphine darts . Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked . Tourists on Africans <unk> then come to view the conservation efforts , which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals ' violent instincts . This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions . 
 Another anti @-@ hunting demonstration becomes the film 's focus , this time on the Isle of Wight . Nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators , and this is contrasted with ancient hunter @-@ gathering groups , who had strict rules concerning nudity . The narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people , so did their rules toward nudity . Also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting , thousands of farm @-@ raised animals had to die to support them . The focus changes to Humboldt penguins , which cannot hunt because of polluted waters , and thus seem detached and without focus . This effect is compared to modern day Eskimos , who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy . To reverse the process , several groups of men go out and revive their hunting ways . Reflected in this is a montage of gun ownership , which the film relates to feelings of masculinity , followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from Africa . To offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching , warriors from the <unk> tribe celebrate the " Ceremony of Life " , in which they masturbate with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river , hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply . Attention shifts to large electronic probes in the Peruvian savanna used to measure the winds of El Niño for optimal fishing conditions . Fishing birds are also electronically tagged so the prime fishing areas can be located based on the birds ' fishing habits . This fish frenzy in South America is reflected in the salmon run in Alaska , where <unk> bears hunt and fight for prey . 
 An examination of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows , where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game , such as rabbits and pheasants . Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted , this time with cheetahs . To demonstrate the cheetah 's speed and effectiveness , a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged , in which the birds are hunted down and killed . The next animal collaborators are dogs , which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd . In cities , however , stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers , which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active , but the prey has changed . Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys , but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development . In one such instance , mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios , one of which they torture , castrate and murder . Various scenes of wildlife are then shown , after which orangutans are hunted to be sold to zoos . The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik <unk> , an ecologist , and wolves , the group of animals he wishes to save .

 As their former cinematographer , Climati drew influence from the Mondo films of Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi . The cinéma vérité styled camera work used in Ultime grida dalla savana was previously used in Africa addio in a scene in which the film crew is nearly killed during an uprising in newly independent Ethiopia . The inclusion of lingering Technicolor shots and violence towards animals is also a feature of Jacopetti 's Mondo cane series . Some scenes were also directly lifted from Africa addio and reused in Ultime grida dalla savana . David Kerekes and David Slater , authors of Killing for Culture : An Illustrated History of Death Film from Mondo to Snuff , also note that , " Savage Man Savage Beast is a slight return to the more encyclopaedic world view of mondo cinema which was prevalent in the 60s , " demonstrating Climati 's early roots in Mondo cinema . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The songs and musical score used in the film were composed and written by Carlo <unk> and Gilbert Kaplan . The songs were sung by Kaplan and Ann Collin . The music resembles Riz Ortolani 's score from Africa addio , as most tracks are of a light and upbeat nature , particularly during the opening and closing credits . The arrangement of music to enhance atmosphere and create comic effect also mimics the compositions in Africa addio . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 The film was released in Italy on 24 October 1975 , and internationally in 1976 . The film fared well in Asia ; in 1976 , Ultime grida dalla savana was outgrossed in Hong Kong only by Jaws . Despite this , reception to the film from mainstream movie critics is almost completely negative , although it is well accepted by critics in exploitation film circles : Mark Goodall calls the film a " remarkable , pseudo @-@ philosophical mondo examination of hunting fixated on the cyclical , the ( inter ) relationship of the hunter and the hunted " , and Kerekes & Slater also comment that it was , " The success of Savage Man ... Savage Beast [ that ] inaugurated the ' savage ' trilogy . " 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 The content of the film , particularly the graphic violence and human death , has been criticized as too explicit and exploitative . Robert Firsching of Allmovie states : 
 The reason for the film 's notoriety , however , is a collection of grainy 16 mm images depicting the horrific round @-@ up , mutilation , castration , and slaughter of a group of tribesmen by white mercenaries . As appalling and revolting a sequence as ever depicted in a documentary film , the massacre footage marked something of a turning point in the development of the mondo subgenre , which moved increasingly toward snuff @-@ like collections of death and mutilation . 
 Time Out Film Guide made similar criticisms of the film 's content , calling it " [ a ] bloody , blatantly exploitative mess of a movie " , and says it is " just another opportunity to <unk> at raw scenes of sex and ( more especially ) violence " . Due to its graphic content , the film was also used by James Ferman at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts as an example of the need for film censorship . 
 The inclusion of several staged or scripted scenes has made the film a target for critical condemnation . Numerous scenes have been proven fake , including the anti @-@ fox hunting campaign involving the fictional " Wild Fox Association " and the murder of the indigenous men by mercenaries . During another wildlife rally , the fabrication of the scene is apparent with the presence of Italian porn star Ilona Staller . The lion attack on Pit Dernitz is also suspected of being a fabrication by film historians . 
 Although staged footage has been included since the early history of Mondo cinema , these scenes are nonetheless targets for critical <unk> . Kerekes and Slater call the anti @-@ fox hunt sequence " self @-@ parody " , and Goodall labels the same scene as " ludicrous " . The staged scenes of human death have also been criticized for being more exploitative than educational . Aside from his criticism of the film 's staged footage , Goodall also points out the reuse of sequences of African tribal hunting and poaching from Africa addio as a flaw of the film . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 Due to its graphic content , Ultime grida dalla savana has encountered censorship issues with certain countries ' film boards . In Australia , the Office of Film and Literature Classification ( OFLC ) banned both an uncut and cut version of the film in 1976 . An appeal filed later that year was denied . Ten years later , the home video distributor Palace Video brought the same cut print before the film board and it received an R18 + rating . The cuts include segments from the lion attack , the torture and murder of the indigenous man by mercenaries , the death of a fox by a pack of hounds , and the death of a stag by a hunter in the opening scene . 
 The film faced similar censorship problems for its theatrical release in the United Kingdom , where it was released as <unk> . In 1976 , nearly 10 minutes were cut before it was passed with an X @-@ rating by the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) . Various scenes of animal cruelty , a race between cheetahs and ostriches , the lion attack , and the mercenaries ' hunt of Amazonian natives were all cut from the British release . The scenes of animal cruelty were targeted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( RSPCA ) to be cut from the film , specifically the hunt and disembowelment of a puma . Also in 1976 , the <unk> <unk> , the Finnish film classification board , banned the film in Finland in its entirety for the inclusion of scenes of genuine human death . 
 = = Influence = = 
 The release of Ultime grida dalla savana initiated a rivalry between Climati and Morra and two other Italian Mondo film makers , Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni . These two filmmaking teams became the frontrunners of the Mondo genre in the late seventies and early eighties . The <unk> had made two previous Mondo films , Africa <unk> and Africa ama , before the release of Ultime grida dalla savana . They later released three additional films : Magia nuda in 1975 , Addio <unk> uomo in 1978 , Africa dolce e selvaggio in 1982 . Climati and Morra made two follow @-@ up films to Ultime grida dalla savana . The first followup , Savana violenta , also known as Savage Man Savage Beast no . 2 , was released in 1976 . Savana violenta was slightly less graphic in its depiction of violence . The last film , Dolce e selvaggio , was released in 1983 and consisted partly of outtakes and recycled footage from Climati and Morra 's two previous films . Each subsequent release by the two parties would attempt to outperform the previous films with more explicit and shocking content . 
 The scenes of human death , which were shot in a manner that resembled an observational documentary , became influential in exploitation cinema , as several subsequent films would use similar filming techniques to lend certain scenes a sense of increased realism . The Mondo film Addio <unk> uomo , directed by the brothers Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni , includes a scene of " amateur footage " that mimics the scene in which mercenaries hunt natives in Ultime grida dalla savana . This scene , in which an African bushman is captured , tortured , and castrated by a rival tribe , has also been proven staged . Again in 1978 , the death film Faces of Death included fabricated " amateur footage " that is a reenactment of the death of Pit Dernitz , replacing lions with a bear . Firsching and Goodall also note that Ultime grida dalla savana was a transitional film within the genre , as it , " provided a vital link between the ' classic ' <unk> of the early @-@ mid 1960s and the much crueller <unk> of the mid 1970s and beyond . " 
 Director Ruggero Deodato also used this camera style prolifically in his film Cannibal Holocaust , in which a group of filmmakers goes missing after they head into the South American rain forest to make a documentary on local cannibal tribes . In the film , only the team 's footage is recovered , which is all shot in the cinéma vérité style that resembles the " amateur footage " in Ultime grida dalla savana . The footage from Cannibal Holocaust proved so realistic that Deodato was arrested for making a snuff film . Charges were ultimately dropped when he produced the supposedly slain actors for the courts .

 The Victoria Rooms , also known as the Vic Rooms , houses the University of Bristol 's music department in Clifton , Bristol , England , on a prominent site at the junction of Queens Road and Whiteladies Road . The building , originally assembly rooms , was designed by Charles Dyer and was constructed between 1838 and 1842 in Greek revival style , and named in honour of Queen Victoria , who had acceded to the throne in the previous year . An eight column Corinthian portico surmounts the entrance , with a classical relief sculpture designed by Musgrave Watson above . The construction is of dressed stonework , with a slate roof . A bronze statue of Edward VII , was erected in 1912 at the front of the Victoria Rooms , together with a curved pool and several fountains with sculptures in the Art Nouveau style . 
 The Victoria Rooms contain a 665 @-@ seat auditorium , a lecture theatre , recital rooms , rehearsal rooms and a recording studio . Jenny Lind and Charles Dickens performed at the Victoria Rooms . It was also the venue for important dinners and assemblies , including banquets to commemorate the opening of the Clifton Suspension Bridge and the <unk> anniversary of Cabot 's discovery of North America , meetings which led to the establishment of the University College , Bristol , an early congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and <unk> " at @-@ homes " . The building was purchased and given to the University in 1920 as a home for the student union and , circa 1924 , it spent a brief period as a cinema . Following a fire in 1934 , the building was refurbished by the University . It remained as the base of the student union until purpose built facilities were opened in Queens Road in the 1960s . The Victoria Rooms then became an exhibition and conference centre , before housing the music department in 1996 . They remain in use in the 21st century for concerts , exhibitions , plays , recitals and lectures .

 The Victoria Rooms , also known colloquially as the Vic Rooms , are situated at the junction of Queen 's Road and Whiteladies Road , in Clifton , Bristol , " occupying one of the finest sites in Clifton , " according to a 1906 visitor 's guide . Gomme , in Bristol : an architectural history ( 1979 ) , described it as a key building on a prominent intersection . The building was designed as assembly rooms by Charles Dyer . The foundation stone was laid on 24 May 1838 , the 19th birthday of Queen Victoria , in whose honour the building was named . Building works in the Greek revival style , incorporating an eight @-@ columned Corinthian portico which is 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) tall , were completed in 1842 . It is constructed of ashlar ( dressed stone work ) with steps leading up to the portico . The roof is of slate . Two sloping ramps were built to allow the passage of carriages into the building . The pediment in the blind attic above the columns has a relief carving attributed to Musgrave Watson " depicting Wisdom in her chariot ushering in the morning , and followed by the Three Graces " , according to Andrew Foyle in Pevsner 's Guide . He adds that the main hall was disappointingly remodelled in 1935 , following a fire the previous year . In 1838 , the design of the interior was described as " nothing either particularly remarkable or new in regard to design " in the Civil Engineer and Architects ' Journal . In 1849 , the interior of the hall was described by Chilcott , in his Descriptive history of Bristol as being decorated in a Greek theme , to match the exterior of the building . Gomme describes the pediment sculpture as " Minerva in car driven by Apollo , accompanied by the Hours and Graces " , attributing the sculpture to Jabez Tyley . Henry Lonsdale , writing in 1866 , explains this anomaly by revealing that Tyley created the sculpture in Bath Stone from a plaster of paris model by Watson . The architecture of the building is described by English Heritage as " a product of European trends of the time , moving away from Neoclassicism and towards Roman Corinthian design . " It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II * listed building . 
 Inside the main entrance is a vestibule which then leads via an octagonal room , with a bowed cast @-@ iron railed balcony and a domed ceiling , to the main auditorium . A correspondent of the Bristol Mercury , in 1846 , described an ingenious central heating system consisting of a cast iron stove which heated and circulated air , " using less than half a cwt . [ 25 kilograms ( 55 lb ) ] of Welsh anthracite in twenty @-@ four hours " , kept the interior of the building some 30 to 40 ° F ( 16 to 22 ° C ) higher than the external temperature . Much of the interior was remodelled in the mid @-@ 20th century , although some period plaster decorations remain in the Regency room . From 1873 the main auditorium housed a large organ originally built for the Royal Panopticon of Arts and Science in Leicester Square , from where it was removed to St Paul 's Cathedral and thence to the Victoria Rooms . In July 1899 it was decided to replace this with an electric organ , which could be played from a keyboard at a considerable distance from the organ itself . The organ was built by Norman & Beard , and was first played by Edwin <unk> on 31 October 1900 ; On 1 December 1934 , a fire started under the stage of the great hall or auditorium , quickly spreading . The Times reported that " The brigades were able to no more than prevent the fire from extending to the Lesser Hall and the recreation rooms . The fine electric organ was completely destroyed . " 
 In the 21st century , the building houses a 665 @-@ seat auditorium and rehearsal rooms . The auditorium is approximately 418 square metres ( 4 @,@ 500 sq ft ) , with an adjacent lecture theatre of some 119 square metres ( 1 @,@ 280 sq ft ) and a recital room of 139 square metres ( 1 @,@ 500 sq ft ) . The purpose built composition and recording studios are in regular use for research and the creation of works . Other facilities include a bar , common rooms , a resource centre and practice rooms . 
 = = Forecourt = = 
 The building was originally surrounded by iron railings as shown in 19th century photographs , but these are no longer there , possibly removed during the Second World War as part of a nationwide scrap drive . 
 A memorial statue of Edward VII , designed by Edwin Alfred Rickards and executed by Henry Poole RA , was erected in 1912 at the front of the Victoria Rooms , together with a curved pool , lamps , steps , balustrades , ornamental crouching lions and fountains with sculptures in the Art Nouveau style . Two sphinxes , which had previously guarded the building , were removed for these new works . The statue and fountains are regarded as fine examples of Rickards and Poole 's work and have been Grade II * listed . An interesting feature of the fountains is that the water flow is controlled by an anemometer " so that on windy days the pressure is reduced in order that the water does not blow across the adjacent roadway .

 The Victoria Rooms were opened on 24 May 1842 ; building had begun in 1838 , and cost £ 23 @,@ 000 . The money was raised by a " body of Conservative citizens " . Jenny Lind and Charles Dickens were just two of the artists known to have performed there . Numerous private subscription balls were held at the rooms , in competition with those organised at the assembly rooms in the Mall , Clifton . This rivalry occasioned disputes between the promoters and accusations of prejudice and snobbery . Other uses included what was the first public demonstration of electric lighting in Bristol in 1863 . It was also the scene for large banquets , such as that to celebrate the opening of the Clifton Suspension Bridge in 1864 , and the celebrations , in 1897 , of the four hundredth anniversary of John Cabot 's discovery of North America . 
 On 11 June 1874 the Victoria Rooms hosted a meeting to promote what was described as a College of Science and Literature for the West of England and South Wales , which became University College , Bristol , an educational institution which existed from 1876 to 1909 . It was the predecessor institution to the University of Bristol , which gained a Royal Charter in 1909 . The meeting was attended by the then President of the British Association and Sir William Thompson ( later Lord Kelvin ) . This meeting has been described as a partial success , as it gained the support of Albert Fry and Lewis Fry , members of the influential Fry family ( the Fry name being known for the chocolate business set up by their grandfather and developed by their father Joseph Storrs Fry ) . Lewis Fry was a Quaker , lawyer and later a Liberal and Unionist Member of Parliament from 1885 – 1892 and 1895 @-@ 1890 for the constituency Bristol North . In 1898 the third congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was held at the rooms . 
 In the early twentieth century , Annie Kenney and Clara Codd , local organisers of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( the suffragettes ) used the Victoria Rooms to host " at homes " , to which all were invited . In 1920 , the rooms were purchased from the original private company by wealthy local industrialist Sir George Wills and given to the University to house the students ' union . It appears that the University briefly leased the building for use as the Clifton Cinema which was situated there in March 1924 , when local photographer Reece Winstone took a photograph . All seats were priced at 1 / 3d . The Victoria Rooms remained the base for the student union until 1964 when a purpose @-@ built facility was constructed in nearby Queen 's Road . The building then became a conference and exhibition centre , hosting occasional concerts such as those by Pink Floyd in 1967 and 1969 . In 1987 the building housed the first incarnation of the Exploratory founded by Richard Gregory – a hands @-@ on science centre and precursor of At @-@ Bristol – until 1989 . The University Music Department was moved into the Victoria Rooms in 1996 . 
 The venue , in the 21st century , has a regular programme of concerts , theatrical performances , lectures and conferences , serving a similar purpose to that for which the building was constructed in the nineteenth century . 
 = Election Special = 
 Election Special is the fifteenth studio album by American musician Ry Cooder , released on August 16 , 2012 , by Perro Verde Records and Nonesuch Records . After his 2011 album Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down , Cooder continued writing topical and storyline @-@ inspired songs . Displeased with the Republican Party and its financial supporters , he also wanted to write an album that would address listeners during the United States presidential election of 2012 , which he believed to be a critical event in the country 's history . Election Special was recorded mostly at Drive @-@ By Studios in North Hollywood and produced by Cooder . 
 Election Special is an American roots and blues rock album of protest songs with music characterized by upbeat melodies , simple instrumentation , and sparse arrangements . Cooder played all of the instruments , including bass , guitar , and mandolin , with the exception of drums by his son Joachim . A deeply political album , it expands on the socio @-@ political musings and current event topics of Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down with forthright , satirical lyrics and song @-@ form vignettes . Cooder 's songwriting exhibits liberal and populist sentiments and draws on older musical sources such as broadside ballads and country blues . 
 Election Special was intended to be released a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention , and Cooder released two of its songs to political media outlets . He also felt cynical about the commercial aspect of making albums and did not tour for the album , citing disinterest in playing large concert venues . Upon its release , Election Special received generally positive reviews from music critics , who complimented its topical protest songs and Cooder 's musicianship . It peaked at number 164 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US , but charted significantly higher in other countries . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 2011 , Cooder recorded Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down after being inspired by a headline about bankers and other affluent people profiting from bank bailouts and the resulting recession during the late @-@ 2000s . Released in August to critical acclaim , it showcased Cooder 's return to his early work 's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption , various economic victims , and an emerging class war . With the album finished , Cooder had developed a penchant for writing such songs and wanted to continue writing more storyline @-@ inspired songs . A month after the album 's release , Cooder had his first short @-@ story collection , Los Angeles Stories , published by City Lights Bookstore . In June 2012 , he joined Time political columnist Joe Klein on the latter 's road trip across the United States , speaking out to people in towns about the state of the nation and its forthcoming presidential election in 2012 . 
 With Election Special , Cooder wanted to write an album with direct lyrics and encourage urgency in listeners during the US presidential election of 2012 . He felt that the election season was " the time of decision in this country ... the most critical time in the history of the country " . When asked about concerns over " preaching to the choir " , Cooder said in an interview for the Los Angeles Times , " I thought I should have a record that says , ' This here record is for you during election time . ' Rather than be vague and poetic , let 's just call this what it is . That way I may get people 's attention . That 's the idea . " Cooder drew on music he grew up listening to such as Depression @-@ era songs and sought to appropriate contemporary subject matter to them . When writing the album , he also touched on the Occupy movement , which he felt optimistic about , saying that " There 's a sign of something . Those people are having conversations , and the conversations become issues and the issues become talked about . Pretty soon , the rest of the world picks up on it , even the politicians . " 
 Cooder 's displeasure with the Republican Party and its financial supporters , particularly the Koch Brothers , also inspired his songwriting . He found the party to be " insanely dangerous " to Barack Obama 's presidency and the US , and said of them in an interview for The Guardian , " in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they <unk> or don 't know their history or they say silly things : that 's just an act , and it 's a useful act . Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are , first of all , that corporations have taken over the country . " He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians , saying that " I don 't write books and give speeches but with a four @-@ minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest a different point of view . It 's like looking around the corner , and that 's what songs are good at sometimes . They hit you with a new thought – assuming that people will listen . " 
 Cooder recorded most of Election Special at Drive @-@ By Studios , the living room of engineer Martin Pradler 's house in North Hollywood . Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth , California . Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations . The album was produced entirely by Cooder . He performed most of the album himself , playing bass , guitar , and mandolin . His son Joachim contributed on drums , and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song " Take Your Hands off It " . At Drive @-@ By Studios , Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed , single @-@ take performances , which he felt helped him channel the songs ' respective characters more efficiently . He later said of his approach to developing the songs , " The way I think these songs can work is if you don 't ponder over it too hard , because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous @-@ combustion effect . What I want to do is get a certain attitude in the voice , and I can only do that once . By take two , I 'm startin ' to think about it . By take three , I 'm startin ' to map it out – it 's gone . It 's spoiled , y 'see ? So I need to get through this fast . " He first recorded the song " The Wall Street Part of Town " in November 2011 . On June 7 , 2012 , the album 's release was announced for a date in August , intended to be a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention .

 Election Special is an American roots and blues rock album of protest songs . It is characterized by upbeat melodies , simple instrumentation , and swinging , sparse arrangements . Music journalist Robin Denselow describes Election Special as " musically ... very much a DIY album , " while Matt Snow of Mojo compares Cooder to Tom Waits as a " gloves @-@ off DIY <unk> in wood , steel , and string . " The album 's music also incorporates folk , roots rock , and , most prominently , blues styles . Music writers compare the album 's mix of folk and blues styles to Cooder 's earlier , distinguishing albums . Zeth Lundy of the Boston Phoenix characterizes Cooder as a " Keith Richards / Woody Guthrie hybrid " on Election Special . 
 The deeply political album expands on the socio @-@ political musings of Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down . Cooder 's forthright lyrics exhibit satire , dark humor , and bitter , apprehensive feelings about current events , including Guantanamo Bay , the Occupy movement , the shooting of Trayvon Martin , Barack Obama 's plight as US President , and the election of 2012 . He addresses these topics through song @-@ form vignettes , which express his anti @-@ Republican party perspective . Cooder 's songwriting also reappropriates lyrics from older musical sources , including protest songs , broadside ballads , and country blues . Nick Coleman of The Independent describes it as " heartfelt and unencumbered with musicological pedantry " , while the newspaper 's Andy Gill comments that Cooder " employs demotic " language and " variations of the blues ... to carry his broadsides . " Jeff Schwager of PopMatters cites Robert Johnson and Woody Guthrie as influences on Cooder 's songcraft for the album . 
 Music writers characterize Cooder 's sentiments and political stance on the album as liberal and populist . Joseph Jon Lanthier of Slant Magazine observes " liberal convictions " and a " bleeding heart " in his lyrics , which he says express " reductive sympathy for President Obama and suspicions that fat cats are perverting the Bill of Rights " . Music essayist Robert Christgau writes that Cooder " <unk> [ ies ] the Popular Front mindset to the messy compromises of electoral politics , and all the must @-@ hears illuminate the 2012 presidential election rather than merely referencing it " . Bud Scoppa of Uncut calls the album " an impassioned screed against the dumbing down of America " and comments that Cooder eschews conventional " preaching " for " three @-@ dimensional characters whose beliefs and opinions span the political spectrum of America in 2012 . " Allmusic 's Thom Jurek cites it as " the most overtly political album of Cooder 's career " to due its " soapbox style " and feels that the songs " express what he considers to be , as both an artist and a pissed @-@ off citizen , the high @-@ stakes historical gamble of the 2012 presidential and congressional contest . " 
 " Mutt Romney Blues " is a three @-@ chord , acoustic Delta blues song . Drawing parallels between the Mitt Romney dog incident and his political " plans and schemes " , the song criticizes Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and is sung from the perspective of the Romney family 's dog . Cooder was inspired by Al Sharpton 's quote " how he treated his dog tells you a lot about him " , and found the dog to be " a useful character ... when you view it in the light of the blues . Like a servant , a <unk> , someone very low in the social order . He 's just begging to be let down [ from the car roof ] . " Bud Scoppa of Uncut characterizes the song as " the musical equivalent of a political cartoon " . " Brother Is Gone " is poignantly styled as a sad folktale and features a haunting mandolin riff , a rueful tone , and wounded vocals . Its lyrics attribute the conservative Koch Brothers to the Deal with the Devil myth , which Cooder adapted from Robert Johnson 's " Cross Road Blues " . The lyrics cite their " crossroads " as " the prairie town of Wichita " , where Koch Industries is headquartered . He said in an interview that " the only logical explanation for the Brothers I could come up with is , they made their deal at the crossroads with Satan . " AllMusic 's Thom Jurek cites it as " among the finest songs [ Cooder ] ' s written . " 
 " The Wall Street Part of Town " incorporates mandolin , Americana guitar riffs , and offers encouragement to protesters . Literary journalist Alec Wilkinson writes that the song 's narrator is " looking for refuge in the part of town where the wind always blows at your back and the ground tilts in your favor . " " Guantanamo " features cascading guitar by Cooder and handclaps . The song is about the nadir of human depravity . A slow , 12 @-@ bar blues lament , " Cold Cold Feeling " features juke joint , bottleneck guitar , and lyrics placing Barack Obama as the narrator singing his blues in the White House . Cooder meant to draw sympathy from listeners for Barack Obama . Geoff Cowart of musicOMH draws similarities of the song to " the voodoo blues of Screaming Jay Hawkins " . " Going to Tampa " is a string band country song in Alla breve meter . Using scathing humor and burlesque lyrical elements , the song 's farcical lyrics depict a fictional hijacking of the 2012 Republican National Convention by the Tea Party , as Cooder accuses both parties of racism and social engineering . 
 Titled after the " drinking the Kool @-@ Aid " metaphor , " Kool @-@ Aid " has a dark electric blues style , noir musical vibes , and lyrics about the politically misguided lower middle class who support Republican tax cuts for the rich . The song 's narrative follows a young American who accepts the Bush administration 's pro @-@ war stance , heads off to a foreign land willing to fight any person of color , and returns to his home jobless . According to writer James C. McKinley , Jr . , the song continues a theme Cooder established on Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down : " the idea of poor whites who have been let down by the politicians they have supported . " It also paraphrases the lyrics to the Western swing standard " Cocaine Blues " , and touches on the controversial stand @-@ your @-@ ground law , which Cooder viewed as " new Jim Crow laws – the stand @-@ your @-@ ground law is already responsible for about 80 shooting deaths of African Americans . " " The 90 and the 9 " repurposes the gospel hymn of the same name and the worker songs of Joe Hill with apocalyptic themes , an anti @-@ war narrative , and a depiction of modern union workers as part of the lower 99 % of income distribution in the US . Cooder was inspired to write the song by military recruitment of high schoolers in his native Los Angeles . " Take Your Hands off It " has a defiant tone , prominent guitar , and lyrics that rousingly defend constitutional rights .

 Cooder 's fifteenth album , Election Special was first released in the Netherlands on August 16 , 2012 . It was subsequently released as a digital download to iTunes on August 17 by Perro Verde Records and Nonesuch Records . The album 's physical release in Germany was also on August 17 . It followed on August 20 in the United Kingdom and Ireland , and on August 21 in North America and Australia . Its pre @-@ order from Nonesuch Records ' website was bundled with a campaign button and bumper sticker designed similarly to the album artwork . 
 Cooder released " The Wall Street Part of Town " as a free download on November 21 , 2011 . The song , which he wrote in support of the Occupy movement , was also aired that month on Democracy Now ! and Jon Wiener 's radio show on KPFK in Los Angeles . After reading her article on Larry McCarthy 's affiliation with the pro @-@ Romney Restore Our Future group , Cooder sent " Going to Tampa " to Jane Mayer of The New Yorker in February 2012 ; the song makes reference to McCarthy 's Willie Horton ad during the 1988 presidential campaign . Mayer subsequently posted the song on SoundCloud and the magazine 's website on February 10 . Cooder also sent " Mutt Romney Blues " to Brave New Films , who subsequently produced a music video for the song . Released virally on February 17 , the video features clips of Romney and a cartoonish <unk> of the 1983 incident with his dog , who is in a car rooftop carrier singing the song . 
 Prior to the album 's release , Cooder played a union hall in San Francisco for a longshoremen 's union , which according to him , " got every turn of phrase . They 'd never heard of me before or any of my records , but they understood all of these lyric things immediately . Because they 've been educated in the union , you know what I mean ? Because they lived it . " On October 14 , Cooder performed at This Land Is Your Land , a concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington , D.C. in tribute to Woody Guthrie . Cooder did not tour in promotion of Election Special , as the Kennedy Center was his last show . In an interview for The Strand at the time , he expressed disinterest in playing larger concert venues for the album , finding them more suitable for " fame " purposes rather than spreading a political message . Cooder remarked on the album 's potential with listeners in general in an interview for Uncut , saying that : 
 Election Special charted at number 164 on the US Billboard 200 , on which it spent one week . It was Cooder 's fourth @-@ highest charting album in the US . It attained higher charting in other countries . In the United Kingdom , the album debuted at number 41 on the UK Albums Chart , and at number five on the Official Record Store Chart . It also debuted at number 25 on the Scottish Albums Chart . Election Special reached its highest position in Norway , where it peaked at number nine . It has charted for four weeks and reached number 28 in the Netherlands .

 Election Special received generally positive reviews from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 77 , based on 17 reviews . In Rolling Stone , David Fricke called the record a " vigorously partisan gem of gritty picking and black humor ... protest music delivered with a patriot 's gifts – the American @-@ roots beauty and expert fire in Ry Cooder 's playing – and long memory . " Desmond Traynor from State hailed Cooder as a " master craftsman " and declared , " social comment once again becomes high art , in the finest American tradition . " Nick Coleman of The Independent found the album engaging and stated , " You might even argue that this and its predecessors ... represent the most cogent work of [ Cooder 's ] long career . " Robin Denselow of The Guardian said that Cooder uses humor and melodies to complement his " anger , protest and concern " . Jeff Schwager of PopMatters found its stories " timeless " and commented that " it 's guaranteed to please anyone inclined to give it a sympathetic listen " . AllMusic 's Thomas Jurek wrote that the album " serves two purposes : one is that it is the most organic record he 's issued in almost two decades ; and , more importantly , it restores topical protest music to a bona fide place in American cultural life . " James C. McKinley , Jr. of The New York Times cited both Election Special and its predecessor as the " most topical " albums Cooder has recorded , while Bud Scoppa of Uncut asserted that he " has never before made an album as immediate as Election Special " because of immediate and cleverly written narratives . 
 In a mixed review , Q criticized Cooder 's " means of conveying " his message and stated , " The fine lyrics have to fight against some weary @-@ sounding arrangements . " Slant Magazine 's Joseph Jon Lanthier called the lyrics " limp " and panned the album as " misfiring , wannabe agitprop " , writing that , " though Cooder 's clearly singing and playing from his bleeding heart on Election Special , the results make one wish that he 'd pass both his mic and his guitar back to his brain . " Geoff Cowart of musicOMH found its message and music to be " weak " and Cooder to be " overly preachy , " commenting that " despite some first @-@ class guitar playing ... the tunes come off second @-@ best to the partisan grudge match . " In his consumer guide for MSN Music , Christgau said protest songs in general are " hard to nail even in the moment " and felt that some of the album 's songs " just don 't twist the screw tight enough " , but quipped , " I give [ Cooder ] extra credit for both preaching to the converted and doing his damnedest to rally the holier @-@ than @-@ thou .

Lee attended the University of South Carolina and graduated with a degree in English and a minor in education . During his college years he developed an interest in music after being inspired by the John Prine album , Great Days . During this period he began playing the guitar and bass as part of a band ( Hot Lava Monster ) and listening to the music of Donny Hathaway , Joni Mitchell , Luther Vandross , Bill Withers and Otis Redding . 
 = = Career = = 
 After returning to Philadelphia , Lee worked as a second grade school teacher at the Mary McLeod Bethune School and as a bartender at local music venues . He performed at " open mic " events in the area and , through his contacts with promoters , was hired as an opening act for artists like Mose Allison and B.B. King . 
 In 2003 , Lee 's manager sent a four @-@ song demo CD to several record labels , and the representative at Blue Note Records was " immediately struck by his [ Lee 's ] voice " . Afterwards , Norah Jones heard Lee 's music while visiting the record company and invited Lee to be the opening act for her 2004 tour . 
 The friendship between Lee 's manager and the manager for Bob Dylan resulted in Lee touring with Dylan as his opening act in early 2005 . Later Lee began touring on his own and recorded his self @-@ titled and " widely praised " debut album of " subtle , folky soul " which included vocals and instrumentation by Norah Jones and members of her band . After it was released , the album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart and Lee was named one of Rolling Stone 's " Top 10 Artists to Watch . " One song from the album , called " Colors " , appeared on the TV show Grey 's Anatomy and in the film Just Like Heaven . Lee 's music received additional media attention when he performed on late night TV shows such as the Late Show with David Letterman and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno . 
 In 2006 , Lee recorded his second album , Supply and Demand which was produced by Barrie Maguire . An NPR Music reviewer described it as having " more complicated instrumentation and production " than his prior work . The song " Shout Out Loud " was released as a single and peaked at No. 76 on the Billboard 200 , and another song , called " Sweet Pea " , was used in an AT & T ad campaign . 
 Lee 's third studio album , Last Days at the Lodge was released in 2008 and re @-@ emphasized " his grounding in folk and soul " . The album peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 chart and Lee performed at the Change Rocks , voter registration rally for Barack Obama , in Philadelphia that summer . 
 In 2011 , Lee released his fourth album on Blue Note Records , entitled Mission Bell which was produced by Joey Burns of Calexico . The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart , number one on the Digital Albums chart , number two on the Internet chart and number one on the Amazon Top @-@ Selling Albums and iTunes charts . The album 's single , " Windows are Rolled Down " , became a top 10 hit on USA Today 's adult @-@ alternative chart . However , the album also has the dubious distinction of being the lowest selling , number one Billboard album as of 2011 selling only 40 @,@ 000 copies . Guest artists on the album included Lucinda Williams , Willie Nelson , Priscilla Ahn , <unk> Brown , James Gadson , and Sam Beam . The album was described by critics as tunes placed in " a stark landscape , enveloped by rustling percussion and reverberant drones " with tones and lyrics that were more optimistic than prior albums . Other critics called it " a restless album with a gentle soul " and " another fine showcase for his [ Lee 's ] elegant , soothing songwriting " . 
 Lee appeared at Farm Aid 2013 and on the compilation album , The Music Is You : A Tribute to John Denver . He released his fifth studio album , Mountains Of Sorrow , Rivers Of Song in October 2013 .

 Lee 's " folksy , bluesy sound " has been compared to that of John Prine and Norah Jones . His music is said to utilize the " supple funk of his vocals and arid strum of his guitar " while recalling " the low @-@ volume , early- ' 70s acoustic soul of stars like Bill Withers and Minnie <unk> " . A New York Times music critic described Lee as having a " honeyed singing voice – light amber , mildly sweet , a touch of grain " which he features " squarely , without much fuss or undue strain " in his " 1970s folk rock and rustic soul " musical song craft . According to a music writer at ABC News , Lee " has that folksy , bluesy vibe , with a bit of country twang " and a voice that is " ever soulful " . Simultaneously Lee has been both lauded and dismissed as the " male Norah Jones " and his lyrics are said to convey " the complexities of everyday emotions " without falling into flowery imagery . Lee 's songs have appeared on a number of TV shows including Parenthood .

 Roy " Wrong Way " Riegels ( April 4 , 1908 – March 26 , 1993 ) played for the University of California , Berkeley football team from 1927 to 1929 . His wrong @-@ way run in the 1929 Rose Bowl is often cited as the worst blunder in the history of college football . That one play overshadowed Riegels ' football talents , since he earned first team All @-@ America honors and served as team captain for the Bears in 1929 . Riegels ' notability has been shared by motivational speakers who use his life as an example of overcoming setbacks . 
 = = Background = = 
 The 1920s saw the first golden age of California football , as the Golden Bears went 50 straight games without a defeat from 1920 to 1925 , with a record of 46 wins and 4 ties . As of 2010 , this is the 3rd longest unbeaten ( not to be confused with winning ) streak in NCAA history . The 1920 – 1924 squads were so dominant that they were nicknamed " The Wonder Teams , " and were coached by Andy Smith . One of the stars during this era was Brick Muller and the University later established a freshman leadership group called the Brick Muller Society . Cal won four Pacific Coast Conference championships and made three trips to the Rose Bowl during this decade , in 1921 ( 28 – 0 win over Ohio State ) , 1922 ( 0 – 0 tie with Washington & Jefferson ) , and 1929 ( 8 – 7 loss to Georgia Tech ) . 
 Riegels played center on the 1928 University of California football team which had 6 – 1 – 2 record going into the Rose Bowl game . Riegels led the Golden Bears in conference minutes played that season , and he was voted onto the All @-@ Coast team . He was a good blocker , but his strength was playing " roving center " on defense , similar to present day middle linebacker position . Cal 's coach Nibs Price gave credit to Riegels as the smartest player he ever coached . Cal 's Rose Bowl opponent was undefeated and had outscored its opponents 213 points to 40 after nine games played . The Rose Bowl game was broadcast nationally by radio during this time . 
 = = The game = = 
 On January 1 , 1929 , the Golden Bears faced the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena , California , USA . Midway through the second quarter , Riegels , who played center on both offensive and defensive lines and who was then playing in a role similar to that of the modern defensive nose guard or nose tackle , picked up a fumble by Tech 's Jack " Stumpy " Thomason . Just 30 yards away from the Yellow Jackets ' end zone , Riegels was somehow turned around and ran 69 yards in the wrong direction . The following describes what transpired from Riegels perspective : 
 I was running toward the sidelines when I picked up the ball , " Riegels told The Associated Press . " I started to turn to my left toward Tech 's goal . Somebody shoved me and I bounded right off into a tackler . In pivoting to get away from him , I completely lost my bearings . 
 Teammate and quarterback Benny Lom chased Riegels , screaming at him to stop . Known for his speed , Lom finally caught up with Riegels at California 's 3 @-@ yard line and tried to turn him around , but he was immediately hit by a wave of Tech players and tackled back to the 1 @-@ yard line . The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone , but Tech 's Vance Maree blocked Lom 's punt for a safety , giving Georgia Tech a 2 – 0 lead . 
 During Roy 's wrong way run , Georgia Tech 's coach Bill Alexander said to his excited players who were jumping up and down near the Tech bench : " Sit down . Sit down . He 's just running the wrong way . Every step he takes is to our advantage " Broadcaster Graham McNamee , who was calling the game on the radio , said during Roy 's wrong way run : " What am I seeing ? What 's wrong with me ? Am I crazy ? Am I crazy ? Am I crazy ? " After the play , Riegels was so distraught that he had to be talked into returning to the game by coach Nibs Price for the second half . Roy said " Coach , I can 't do it . I 've ruined you , I 've ruined myself , I 've ruined the University of California . I couldn 't face that crowd to save my life . " Coach Price responded by saying " Roy , get up and go back out there — the game is only half over . " 
 Riegels did play , and he turned in a stellar second half performance , including blocking a Tech punt . In addition , Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point , but that was not enough . Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8 – 7 . Georgia Tech 's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game , which increased the significance of Roy 's mistake . In spite of the loss , the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up , return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the game , coach Nibs Price defended Riegels , saying " It was an accident that might have happened to anyone . " That one play overshadowed Riegels ' football talents . Georgia Tech center and captain Peter Pund said Riegels was " the best center I have played against all year . He 's a <unk> , and he never quit . " Riegels would take his spot as team captain during his senior year , earning All @-@ America honors , and he helped the Bears to a 7 – 1 – 1 record during the following season . Later , the NCAA football rules committee would pass a rule barring a player from advancing a recovered fumble once it hits the ground , which remained in place for several decades . According to one contemporary article , there were approximately 4 @,@ 500 stories totaling an estimated 250 @,@ 000 column inches written about Riegels ' wrong way run in newspapers across the United States . 
 Riegels gained notoriety from his wrong way run , but he was able to capitalize on his blunder , parodying his famous run in vaudeville acts . The opening sequence of the 1929 Frank Capra movie Flight is based on Riegels and uses photographs of him . In 1965 , the movie John Goldfarb , Please Come Home was released and the lead character performs a similar blunder in his college years , earning the name " Wrong Way " Goldfarb . In 2011 , a picture book written by Dan Gutman was published with title " The Day Roy Riegels Ran the Wrong Way , " which provides play @-@ by @-@ play description of this moment in sports history . 
 Looking back on the play years later , <unk> said " I was embarrassed when I realized what I had done . I wanted a hole to open in the ground so I could jump in it . But that soon passed , and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle . Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since , except in cases when people tried to exploit it . " Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life . Riegels once said : " All the times I 've run across or heard people saying ' wrong way , ' even though they weren 't referring to me , I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me . I still don 't understand how I did it . " Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened . Riegels once joked " If I had to do it again , I 'd still run in the same direction , for I surely thought I was going the right way . " Riegels also said " You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60 @,@ 000 people , and it 's pretty hard to lie out of it . " When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen 's Club 42 years later , Riegels quipped , " Believe me , I feel I 've earned this . " 
 Riegels sent letters to athletes who made similar mistakes . For example , Riegels sent a letter to Paramount High School 's Jan <unk> in 1957 , who had intercepted a pass only to run it 55 yards into his own end zone , resulting in a safety for Centennial High , who won the game 9 – 7 . Riegels wrote in the letter : " For many years I 've had to go along and laugh whenever my wrong @-@ way run was brought up , even though I 've grown tired listening and reading about it . But it certainly wasn 't the most serious thing in the world . I regretted doing it , even as you do , but you 'll get over it . " In addition , during an NFL game in 1964 between the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers , Minnesota defensive end Jim Marshall ran a recovered fumble 66 yards into his own end zone ( resulting in a safety , but the Vikings won 27 – 22 ) . Riegels reportedly later sent Marshall a letter reading " Welcome to the club " . 
 In later years , Riegels said his blunder made him a better person . " I gained true understanding of life from my Rose Bowl mistake , " he said in an interview with the Pasadena Star . " I learned you can bounce back from misfortune and view it as just something adverse that happened to you . " 
 In 1991 , Riegels was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame . He was posthumously elected to Cal 's Hall of Fame in 1998 . In 2003 , a panel from the College Football Hall of Fame and CBS Sports chose Riegels ' " Wrong way run in the Rose Bowl " one of six " Most Memorable Moments of the Century . "

 = Jharokha Darshan = 
 Jharokha Darshan was a daily practice of addressing the public audience ( darshan ) at the balcony ( jharokha ) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India . It was an essential and direct way of communicating face @-@ to @-@ face with the public , and was a practice which was adopted by the Mughal emperors . The balcony appearance in the name of Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha @-@ i darshan was adopted by the 16th @-@ century Mughal Emperor Akbar , even though it was contrary to Islamic injunctions . Earlier , Akbar 's father Emperor Humayun had also adopted this Hindu practice of appearing before his subjects at the jharokha to hear their public grievances . 
 Darshan is a Sanskrit word which means " sight " and " beholding " ( also means : " the viewing of an idol or a saint " ) which was adopted by Mughals for their daily appearance before their subjects . This also showed a Hindu influence , It was first practiced by Humayun before Akbar adopted it as a practice at sunrise . Jharokha is an easterly facing " ornate bay @-@ window " , canopied , throne @-@ balcony , the " balcony for viewing " ( an oriel window projecting out of the wall ) provided in every palace or fort where the kings or emperors resided during their reign . Its architecture served not only the basic need for lighting and ventilation but also attained a divine concept during the reign of Mughals . The jharokha appearances by the Mughals have been depicted by many paintings . 
 Giving Jharokha Darshan from this jharokha was a daily feature . This tradition was also continued by rulers who followed Akbar ( r . 1556 – 1605 CE ) . Jahangir ( r . 1605 – 27 CE ) and Shah Jahan ( r . 1628 – 58 CE ) also appeared before their subjects <unk> . However , this ancient practice was discontinued by Aurangzeb during his 11th year of reign as he considered it a non @-@ Islamic practice , a form of idol worship . In Agra Fort and Red Fort , the jharokha faces the Yamuna and the emperor would stand alone on the jharokha to greet his subjects . 
 Mughal emperors during their visits outside their capital used to give Jharokha Darshan from their portable wooden house known as Do @-@ Ashiayana Manzil . 
 During the Delhi Durbar held in Delhi on 12 December 1911 , King George V and his consort , Queen Mary , made a grand appearance at the jharokha of the Red Fort to give a " darshan " to 500 @,@ 000 common people .

 = = = During Humayun 's reign = = = 
 The Hindu practice of appearing before the people at the jharokha was started by Humayun , though the practice is generally credited to Akbar . Humayun had fixed a drum beneath the wall so that the petitioners assembled below the jharokha could beat it to draw his attention . 
 = = = During Akbar 's reign = = = 
 Akbar 's daily practice of worshiping the sun in the early morning at his residence in Agra Fort led him to initiate the Jharokha Darshan . Hindus , who used to bathe in the river at that hour greeted Akbar when he appeared on the jharokha window for sun worship . It was also the period when Akbar was promoting his liberal religious policy , and in pursuance of this liberal approach he started the Jharokha Darshan . Thereafter , Akbar would religiously start his morning with prayers and then attend the Jharokha Darshan and greet the large audience gathered every day below the jharokha . He would spend about an hour at the jharokha " seeking acceptance of imperial authority as part of popular faith " , and after this he would attend the court at the Diwan @-@ i @-@ Aam for two hours attending to administrative duties . 
 The crowd of people assembled below the balcony generally consisted of soldiers , merchants , craft persons , peasants , and women and sick children . As the balcony was set high , the king would stand on a platform so that people gathered below could reassure themselves that he was alive and that the empire was stable ; even when the sovereign was ill . He felt that it was necessary to see them publicly at least once a day in order to maintain his control , and guard against immediate anarchy . It also had a symbolic purpose . During this time people might make personal requests directly to Akbar , or present him with petitions for some cause . Akbar , therefore , began appearing at the jharokha twice a day and would hear the complaints of the people who wished to speak to him . Sometimes , while the emperor gave his Jharokha Darshan , he would let out a thread down the jharokha so that people could tie their complaints and petitions seeking his attention and justice . It was an effective way of communication and information exchange process , which <unk> , a contemporary of Akbar noted Jharokha Darshan worked effectively under Akbar who spent about four and half hours regularly in such darshan . Akbar 's paintings giving Jharokha Darshan are also popular . 
 = = = During Jahangir 's reign = = = 
 Akbar 's son , Emperor Jahangir , also continued the practice of Jharokha Darshan . In Agra Fort , the jharokha window is part of the structure which represents the Shah Burj , the Royal Tower . The tower is in the shape of an octagon and has a white marble pavilion . During Jahangir 's time and even more frequently under Shah Jahan 's rule this jharokha was used for giving darshan . During Jahangir 's Jharokha Darshan , hanging a string to tie petitions , was also practiced . This was also a Persian system under <unk> . Jahangir elaborated on this system by adopting a golden chain to tie the petitions but Aurangzeb stopped it . Nur Jahan , Jahangir 's wife , was also known to have sat for the Jharokha Darshan and conducted administrative duty with the common people and hearing their pleas . Jahangir was fully dedicated to the practice and made it a point to conduct the Jharokha Darshan even if he was sick ; he had said " even in the time of weakness I have gone every day to the jharokha , though in great pain and sorrow , according to my fixed custom . " 
 Jahangir 's painting giving Jharokha Darshan shows him sitting at the jharokha in a side profile , bedecked with jewelry and wearing a red turban in the background of a pale purple coloured cushion . 
 = = = During Shah Jahan 's reign = = = 
 Emperor Shah Jahan maintained a rigorous schedule during his entire thirty years rule and used to get up at 4 AM and , after ablutions and prayers , religiously appeared at the jharokha window to show himself to his subjects . During his stay in Agra or Delhi , huge crowds used to assemble to receive his darshan below the balcony . He would appear before the public 45 minutes after sunrise . His subjects would bow before him which he would reciprocate with his imperial salute . There was one particular group of people known as <unk> ( akin to the guilds of <unk> of the Roman Empire ) who were " servile " to the king and who would take their food only after they had a look at the face of the emperor which they considered as auspicious . More than half an hour had to be spent by the King at the balcony as it was the only time people could submit petitions to the king directly through the chain let down for the purpose ( which was drawn up by attendants ) of receiving such petitions by passing the nobles of the court . At one time in 1657 when Shah Jahan was sick he could not appear for the Jharokha Darshan which spread speculations of his death . 
 There were times when people used to gather below the jharokha window to hold protest demonstrations to place their grievances before the emperor . One such incident occurred in 1641 in Lahore when people who were affected by famine and were starving pleaded before Shah Jahan to provide famine relief . 
 It is also said of Shah Jehan that his Islamic orthodoxy was more than that of his father or his grandfather and that he was skeptical to carry out the function of Jharokha Darshan as it could be misconstrued as worship of the sun . However , this practice was so deep @-@ rooted with in the " Mughal Kingship and State " that he was compelled to continue this practice . 
 = = = During Aurangzeb 's reign = = = 
 There is a proof that Aurangzeb continued the Mughal practice of Jharokha Darshan in a painting dated 1710 in which he is shown at the jharokha with two noblemen in attendance in the foreground . In this painting , the emperor is painted in a side profile and has a white <unk> ( upper garment ) attire adorned with a turban in a background of blue colour . In 1670 , Hindus had assembled at the jharokha to protest against the jizya tax imposed on them by Aurangzeb . However , Aurangzeb who was a " puritanical " and practiced strict Islamic codes of conduct in his personal life , stopped this practice on the basis that it was idolization of human beings . He stopped this practice during the 11th year of his rule . He also felt that it was " savouring of the Hindu ceremony of darshan " .

 Do @-@ Ashiayana Manzil was a portable wooden house used by the Mughal emperors during their visits outside their capital . This was a double storied house built with a platform supported over 16 pillars , of 6 yards height . Pillars were 4 cubits in height joined with nuts and bolts which formed the upper floor . This functioned as a sleeping quarter for the king and also for worship and holding Jharokha Darshan , and considered it an emulation of Hindu practice .
