 = Soeprapto ( prosecutor ) = 
 Mr. Raden Soeprapto ( 27 March 1894 – 2 December 1964 ) was the fourth Attorney General of Indonesia . Born in Trenggalek , East Java , Soeprapto studied law in Jakarta , finding work in the legal system soon after graduating in 1920 . After transferring often , in the early 1940s he had reached Pekalongan and become the head of the court for Native Indonesians . Escaping Pekalongan during Operatie Product with the help of a prisoner he had just sentenced , Soeprapto made his way to Yogyakarta and began to work as a prosecutor . When the government moved to Jakarta in 1950 , Soeprapto went with it . In January 1951 , he was selected to be Prosecutor General of Indonesia , serving until 1 April 1959 . 
 As prosecutor general , Soeprapto was noted for trying state ministers and generals despite them outranking him , a quality which Amir Hasan <unk> of the Prosecutors ' Commission finds lacking from subsequent officeholders . He was declared " Father of the Prosecutor 's Office " on 22 July 1967 , with a bust of him erected outside the Prosecutor General 's Office . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Soeprapto was born in Trenggalek , East Java , Dutch East Indies on 27 March 1894 to <unk> , a tax collector , and his wife . He took his elementary studies at a <unk> <unk> School , then considered better than schools for Native Indonesians , eventually graduating in 1914 . He then moved to Batavia ( modern day Jakarta ) , where he studied at <unk> with future state minister Wongsonegoro . 
 After graduating from the <unk> in 1920 , Soeprapto went directly to working at the Landraad ( court for Native Indonesians ) in his hometown . For fifteen years he worked at Landraad in various locations , including in Surabaya , Semarang , Bandung , and Denpasar . He eventually rose to Head of the Landraad in Cirebon and Kuningan , serving from 1937 to 1941 . From there , he transferred to the Landraad for Salatiga and <unk> , then to Besuki , before settling as head of the <unk> in Pekalongan . 
 Although Soeprapto was able to lead the court peacefully during the Japanese occupation , after the start of the Indonesian National Revolution the situation in Pekalongan became unstable . Although the nascent army was able to hold the peace during riots at the end of 1945 , when the Dutch began a major assault on Java , Soeprapto was forced to flee south to Indonesian @-@ held areas with his family . In this , Soeprapto was assisted by Kutil , a man whom he had only recently sentenced to death , and Kutil 's other captive accomplices . Soeprapto 's wife later remembered that Kutil and his men had " carried briefcases containing paperwork related to their cases ... and even [ Soeprapto 's ] children , without showing any vengeance . " Although Kutil and his men escaped after evacuating , they were later recaptured , with Soeprapto serving as a witness against them . 
 After his escape from Pekalongan , Soeprapto and his family first went to Cirebon . They then went to Yogyakarta , where Soeprapto became a judge at the high court . He later began work as a prosecutor , rising quickly through the ranks ; several of his coworkers attributed it to the Kutil case , where Soeprapto demonstrated that he believed in the supremacy of law . 
 = = Prosecutor general and later career = = 
 In 1950 , Soeprapto returned to Jakarta and continued his work as a prosecutor . In January 1951 , he was chosen to replace <unk> as Prosecutor General of Indonesia . At the time , the prosecutor general 's office was a division of the Ministry of Justice , and as such Soeprapto was under the Minister of Justice . 
 During his time as prosecutor general , Soeprapto handled several high @-@ profile cases , going after ministers and generals that outranked him politically . In 1953 , he brought Sultan Hamid II , then a minister without portfolio , to trial for his involvement in the APRA Coup d 'état ; Hamid was sentenced to 10 years in prison by Supreme Court Justice <unk> <unk> on 8 April 1953 . Soeprapto also investigated Head of the Armed Forces Abdul Haris Nasution for his involvement in the affair . Other cases included the trials of revolutionary groups and foreigners accused of undermining the Indonesian government . He also oversaw an increasing number of prosecutors , drawn from Indonesian law schools . 
 However , Soeprapto also came into conflict with Minister of Justice Moeljatno over the role of the prosecution . Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general 's office , under the control of the Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period , was in a similar station after independence ; on the other hand , Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet . This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice , which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers . However , the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957 . 
 After eight years , Soeprapto was honourably dismissed on 1 April 1959 @.@ the dismissal has been reported in several sources to be related to the acquittal of / dropping of charges against two foreigners , <unk> and Schmidt , who had been accused of undermining the government ; <unk> died in prison , and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did not appeal . As he had not been given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities ; at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta . His wife later noted that this led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno 's regime . 
 Soeprapto married three times . He first married <unk> of Purworejo , with whom he had a son . He then married <unk> <unk> of Bogor , with whom he had a daughter . His last marriage was to <unk> , with whom he had two sons and two daughters . He died on 2 December 1964 , and was buried at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in Jakarta .

 Soeprapto was posthumously declared the " Father of the Prosecutor 's Office " on 22 July 1967 by Prosecutor General <unk> , which was formally recognized by Letter of Recommendation Number KEP @-@ 061 / <unk> / 1967 . That same year , a bust of him was placed in front of the prosecutor general 's office in Jakarta . Several streets are named after Soeprapto , including in Gresik , Malang , and Surabaya . 
 Amir Hasan <unk> of the Prosecutors ' Commission stated in 2010 that Soeprapto was an example of what a prosecutor general should be : firm , knowledgeable , and unwilling to allow outside intervention in his investigations – even from the president . This quality , he said , was lacking in subsequent officeholders . The following year , <unk> Warman Adam of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences stated that there had yet to be another prosecutor general like Soeprapto , for – rather than investigating cases of corruption and keeping politics out of the position – subsequent holders of the office had often been corrupt themselves .

 Midnight Sun ( 1940 – 65 ) was one of the leading sires of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed , and a two @-@ time World Grand Champion in 1945 and 1946 . He was trained by Fred Walker and lived almost all his life at Harlinsdale Farm in Franklin , Tennessee . 
 Midnight Sun sired approximately 2 @,@ 600 foals in his life , one of which became the three @-@ time World Grand Champion The Talk of the Town . Of the horses that have won the annual Tennessee Walking Horse World Grand Championship since 1949 , only four were not of Midnight Sun 's bloodline .

 Midnight Sun was foaled on June 8 , 1940 , out of a mostly Standardbred mare named Ramsey 's Rena , and sired by the stallion Wilson 's Allen . He was a solid black stallion who matured to just under 16 hands ( 64 inches , 163 cm ) and weighed 1 @,@ 350 pounds ( 610 kg ) , unusually stout for his breed . His original name was Joe Lewis Wilson . 
 Through his sire Midnight Sun was a great @-@ grandson of Black Allan , also known as Allan F @-@ 1 , who was the foundation sire of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed . Midnight Sun 's half @-@ brother on his sire 's side , Strolling Jim , became the first ever National Champion in 1939 , and three of his other siblings were early champions as well . In 1944 Midnight Sun was bought by Wirt and Alex Harlin for $ 4 @,@ 400 and taken to their Harlinsdale Farm . 
 Midnight Sun was trained by Fred Walker . He became the first Tennessee Walking Horse to win the World Grand Championship title when it was first awarded in 1945 , and he followed up that win with another World Grand Championship the next year , in 1946 , making him the second repeat winner after Haynes Peacock , his half @-@ brother . At the time , the stake carried a purse of $ 1 @,@ 000 . 
 Midnight Sun was known for his calm disposition ; it wasn 't uncommon for <unk> at his home , Harlinsdale Farm near Franklin , Tennessee , to let visiting children ride him bareback , so they could say they rode a two @-@ time world grand champion . In 1956 he was bought by Eleanor and Geraldine Livingston at the Harlinsdale Farm dispersal sale , for $ 50 @,@ 000 . The <unk> stipulated that Midnight Sun be kept at Harlinsdale under the same routine he had had for most of his life . He continued to stand at stud on the farm until his death , and was handled and groomed nearly all his life by Red Laws , who died within a year of the horse 's death . Midnight Sun was never turned out , and Laws once said , " Somebody had hold of him all his life . " In all , he lived at Harlinsdale Farm for 21 years . Midnight Sun died of colic on November 7 , 1965 , and was buried at Harlinsdale Farm , where his grave is still visible today .

 = Cabbage = 
 Cabbage or headed cabbage ( comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea ) is a leafy green or purple biennial plant , grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense @-@ leaved heads . It is descended from the wild cabbage , B. oleracea var. oleracea , and is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower ( var. botrytis ) , <unk> sprouts ( var. <unk> ) and savoy cabbage ( var. <unk> ) . Cabbage heads generally range from 0 @.@ 5 to 4 kilograms ( 1 to 9 lb ) , and can be green , purple and white . Smooth @-@ leafed firm @-@ headed green cabbages are the most common , with smooth @-@ leafed red and crinkle @-@ leafed savoy cabbages of both colors seen more rarely . It is a multi @-@ layered vegetable . Under conditions of long sunlit days such as are found at high northern latitudes in summer , cabbages can grow much larger . Some records are discussed at the end of the history section . 
 It is difficult to trace the exact history of cabbage , but it was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC , although <unk> were not developed until the 16th century . By the Middle Ages , it had become a prominent part of European cuisine . Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant 's life cycle , but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year , and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross @-@ pollination . Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies , as well as to multiple pests , and bacterial and fungal diseases . 
 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) reports that world production of cabbage and other brassicas for 2011 was almost 69 million metric tons ( 68 million long tons ; 75 million short tons ) . Almost half of these crops were grown in China , where Chinese cabbage is the most popular Brassica vegetable . Cabbages are prepared in many different ways for eating . They can be pickled , fermented for dishes such as sauerkraut , steamed , stewed , sautéed , braised , or eaten raw . Cabbage is a good source of vitamin K , vitamin C and dietary fiber . Contaminated cabbage has been linked to cases of food @-@ borne illness in humans . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 Cabbage ( Brassica oleracea or B. oleracea var. capitata , var. tuba , var. <unk> or var. <unk> ) is a member of the genus Brassica and the mustard family , Brassicaceae . Several other cruciferous vegetables ( sometimes known as cole crops ) are considered cultivars of B. oleracea , including broccoli , collard greens , <unk> sprouts , <unk> and sprouting broccoli . All of these developed from the wild cabbage B. oleracea var. oleracea , also called <unk> or field cabbage . This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today , as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics , such as large heads for cabbage , large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli . The varietal epithet capitata is derived from the Latin word for " having a head " . B. oleracea and its derivatives have hundreds of common names throughout the world . 
 " Cabbage " was originally used to refer to multiple forms of B. oleracea , including those with loose or non @-@ existent heads . A related species , Brassica rapa , is commonly named Chinese , <unk> or celery cabbage , and has many of the same uses . It is also a part of common names for several unrelated species . These include cabbage bark or cabbage tree ( a member of the genus <unk> ) and cabbage palms , which include several genera of palms such as <unk> , Roystonea oleracea , Acrocomia and Euterpe <unk> . 
 The original family name of brassicas was Cruciferae , which derived from the flower petal pattern thought by medieval Europeans to resemble a crucifix . The word brassica derives from <unk> , a Celtic word for cabbage . Many European and Asiatic names for cabbage are derived from the Celto @-@ Slavic root cap or <unk> , meaning " head " . The late Middle English word cabbage derives from the word <unk> ( " head " ) , from the Picard dialect of Old French . This in turn is a variant of the Old French <unk> . Through the centuries , " cabbage " and its derivatives have been used as slang for numerous items , occupations and activities . Cash and tobacco have both been described by the slang " cabbage " , while " cabbage @-@ head " means a fool or stupid person and " <unk> " means to be exhausted or , vulgarly , in a vegetative state . 
 = = Description = = 
 Cabbage seedlings have a thin taproot and cordate ( heart @-@ shaped ) cotyledon . The first leaves produced are ovate ( egg @-@ shaped ) with a lobed petiole . Plants are 40 – 60 cm ( 16 – 24 in ) tall in their first year at the mature vegetative stage , and 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 0 m ( 4 @.@ 9 – 6 @.@ 6 ft ) tall when flowering in the second year . Heads average between 1 and 8 pounds ( 0 @.@ 5 and 4 kg ) , with fast @-@ growing , earlier @-@ maturing varieties producing smaller heads . Most cabbages have thick , alternating leaves , with margins that range from wavy or lobed to highly dissected ; some varieties have a waxy bloom on the leaves . Plants have root systems that are fibrous and shallow . About 90 percent of the root mass is in the upper 20 – 30 cm ( 8 – 12 in ) of soil ; some lateral roots can penetrate up to 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) deep . 
 The inflorescence is an unbranched and indeterminate terminal raceme measuring 50 – 100 cm ( 20 – 40 in ) tall , with flowers that are yellow or white . Each flower has four petals set in a perpendicular pattern , as well as four sepals , six stamens , and a superior ovary that is two @-@ celled and contains a single stigma and style . Two of the six stamens have shorter filaments . The fruit is a <unk> that opens at maturity through dehiscence to reveal brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape . Self @-@ pollination is impossible , and plants are cross @-@ pollinated by insects . The initial leaves form a rosette shape comprising 7 to 15 leaves , each measuring 25 – 35 cm ( 10 – 14 in ) by 20 – 30 cm ( 8 – 12 in ) ; after this , leaves with shorter petioles develop and heads form through the leaves cupping inward . 
 Many shapes , colors and leaf textures are found in various cultivated varieties of cabbage . Leaf types are generally divided between crinkled @-@ leaf , loose @-@ head <unk> and smooth @-@ leaf firm @-@ head cabbages , while the color spectrum includes white and a range of greens and purples . Oblate , round and pointed shapes are found . 
 Cabbage has been selectively bred for head weight and morphological characteristics , frost hardiness , fast growth and storage ability . The appearance of the cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding , with varieties being chosen for shape , color , firmness and other physical characteristics . Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage . Scientific research into the genetic modification of B. oleracea crops , including cabbage , has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance . Genetically modified B. oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture . 
 = = History = = 
 Although cabbage has an extensive history , it is difficult to trace its exact origins owing to the many varieties of leafy greens classified as " brassicas " . The wild ancestor of cabbage , Brassica oleracea , originally found in Britain and continental Europe , is tolerant of salt but not encroachment by other plants and consequently inhabits rocky cliffs in cool damp coastal habitats , retaining water and nutrients in its slightly thickened , turgid leaves . According to the triangle of U theory of the evolution and relationships between Brassica species , B. oleracea and other closely related kale vegetables ( cabbages , kale , broccoli , Brussels sprouts , and cauliflower ) represent one of three ancestral lines from which all other brassicas originated . 
 Cabbage was probably domesticated later in history than Near Eastern crops such as lentils and summer wheat . Because of the wide range of crops developed from the wild B. oleracea , multiple broadly contemporaneous <unk> of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe . <unk> cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated , before 1000 BC , by the Celts of central and western Europe . 
 Unidentified brassicas were part of the highly conservative unchanging Mesopotamian garden repertory . 
 It is believed that the ancient Egyptians did not cultivate cabbage , which is not native to the Nile valley , though a word <unk> 't in Papyrus Harris of the time of Ramesses III , has been interpreted as " cabbage " . Ptolemaic Egyptians knew the cole crops as <unk> , under the influence of Greek <unk> , which had been a familiar plant to the Macedonian antecedents of the Ptolemies ; By early Roman times Egyptian artisans and children were eating cabbage and turnips among a wide variety of other pulses and vegetables . 
 The ancient Greeks had some varieties of cabbage , as mentioned by Theophrastus , although whether they were more closely related to today 's cabbage or to one of the other Brassica crops is unknown . The headed cabbage variety was known to Greeks as <unk> and to Romans as brassica or <unk> ; the open , leafy variety ( kale ) was known in Greek as <unk> and in Latin as <unk> . 
 Chrysippus of <unk> wrote a treatise on cabbage , which Pliny knew , but it has not survived . The Greeks were convinced that cabbages and grapevines were inimical , and that cabbage planted too near the vine would impart its unwelcome odor to the grapes ; this Mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today . 
 Brassica was considered by some Romans a table luxury , although Lucullus considered it unfit for the senatorial table . The more traditionalist Cato the Elder , espousing a simple , Republican life , ate his cabbage cooked or raw and dressed with vinegar ; he said it surpassed all other vegetables , and approvingly distinguished three varieties ; he also gave directions for its medicinal use , which extended to the cabbage @-@ eater 's urine , in which infants might be rinsed . Pliny the Elder listed seven varieties , including Pompeii cabbage , Cumae cabbage and <unk> cabbage . According to Pliny , the Pompeii cabbage , which could not stand cold , is " taller , and has a thick stock near the root , but grows thicker between the leaves , these being <unk> and narrower , but their tenderness is a valuable quality " . The Pompeii cabbage was also mentioned by Columella in De Re <unk> . Apicius gives several recipes for <unk> , tender cabbage shoots . The Greeks and Romans claimed medicinal usages for their cabbage varieties that included relief from gout , headaches and the symptoms of poisonous mushroom ingestion . The antipathy towards the vine made it seem that eating cabbage would avoid drunkenness . Cabbage continued to figure in the materia medica of antiquity as well as at table : in the first century AD Dioscorides mentions two kinds of <unk> with medical uses , the cultivated and the wild , and his opinions continued to be paraphrased in herbals right through the 17th century . 
 At the end of Antiquity cabbage is mentioned in De <unk> <unk> ( " On the Observance of Foods " ) of <unk> , a Greek doctor at the court of Theodoric the Great , and cabbage appears among vegetables directed to be cultivated in the <unk> de <unk> , composed c . 771 @-@ 800 that guided the governance of the royal estates of Charlemagne . 
 In Britain the Anglo @-@ Saxon cultivated <unk> . When round @-@ headed cabbages appeared in 14th @-@ century England they were called <unk> and <unk> , words drawn from Old French and applied at first to refer to the ball of unopened leaves , the contemporaneous recipe that commences " Take cabbages and quarter them , and seethe them in good broth " , also suggests the tightly headed cabbage . 
 Manuscript illuminations show the prominence of cabbage in the cuisine of the High Middle Ages , and cabbage seeds feature among the seed list of purchases for the use of King John II of France when captive in England in 1360 , but cabbages were also a familiar staple of the poor : in the lean year of 1420 the " Bourgeois of Paris " noted that " poor people ate no bread , nothing but cabbages and turnips and such dishes , without any bread or salt " . French naturalist Jean Ruel made what is considered the first explicit mention of head cabbage in his 1536 botanical treatise De Natura Stirpium , referring to it as <unk> <unk> ( " head @-@ <unk> " ) , Sir Anthony Ashley , 1st Baronet , did not disdain to have a cabbage at the foot of his monument in Wimborne St Giles . 
 In Istanbul Sultan Selim III penned a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek ode to cabbage : without cabbage the halva feast was not complete . Cabbages spread from Europe into Mesopotamia and Egypt as a winter vegetable , and later followed trade routes throughout Asia and the Americas . The absence of Sanskrit or other ancient Eastern language names for cabbage suggests that it was introduced to South Asia relatively recently . In India , cabbage was one of several vegetable crops introduced by colonizing traders from Portugal , who established trade routes from the 14th to 17th centuries . Carl Peter Thunberg reported that cabbage was not yet known in Japan in 1775 . 
 Many cabbage varieties — including some still commonly grown — were introduced in Germany , France , and the Low Countries . During the 16th century , German gardeners developed the savoy cabbage . During the 17th and 18th centuries , cabbage was a food staple in such countries as Germany , England , Ireland and Russia , and pickled cabbage was frequently eaten . <unk> was used by Dutch , Scandinavian and German sailors to prevent scurvy during long ship voyages . 
 Jacques Cartier first brought cabbage to the Americas in 1541 – 42 , and it was probably planted by the early English colonists , despite the lack of written evidence of its existence there until the mid @-@ 17th century . By the 18th century , it was commonly planted by both colonists and native American Indians . Cabbage seeds traveled to Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet , and were planted the same year on Norfolk Island . It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the Sydney Markets . 
 There are several Guinness Book of World Records entries related to cabbage . These include the heaviest cabbage , at 57 @.@ 61 kilograms ( 127 @.@ 0 lb ) , heaviest red cabbage , at 19 @.@ 05 kilograms ( 42 @.@ 0 lb ) , longest cabbage roll , at 15 @.@ 37 meters ( 50 @.@ 4 ft ) , and the largest cabbage dish , at 925 @.@ 4 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 040 lb ) .

 = = Cultivation = = 
 Cabbage is generally grown for its densely leaved heads , produced during the first year of its biennial cycle . Plants perform best when grown in well @-@ drained soil in a location that receives full sun . Different varieties prefer different soil types , ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay , but all prefer fertile ground with a pH between 6 @.@ 0 and 6 @.@ 8 . For optimal growth , there must be adequate levels of nitrogen in the soil , especially during the early head formation stage , and sufficient phosphorus and potassium during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves . Temperatures between 4 and 24 ° C ( 39 and 75 ° F ) prompt the best growth , and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting ( flowering ) . Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures ( a process called <unk> ) only occurs if the plant is past the juvenile period . The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) . <unk> allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering . In certain climates , cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower , a practice that was common in the eastern US . 
 Plants are generally started in protected locations early in the growing season before being transplanted outside , although some are seeded directly into the ground from which they will be harvested . Seedlings typically emerge in about 4 – 6 days from seeds planted 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) deep at a soil temperature between 20 and 30 ° C ( 68 and 86 ° F ) . Growers normally place plants 30 to 61 cm ( 12 to 24 in ) apart . Closer spacing reduces the resources available to each plant ( especially the amount of light ) and increases the time taken to reach maturity . Some varieties of cabbage have been developed for ornamental use ; these are generally called " flowering cabbage " . They do not produce heads and feature purple or green outer leaves surrounding an inner grouping of smaller leaves in white , red , or pink . Early varieties of cabbage take about 70 days from planting to reach maturity , while late varieties take about 120 days . Cabbages are mature when they are firm and solid to the touch . They are harvested by cutting the stalk just below the bottom leaves with a blade . The outer leaves are trimmed , and any diseased , damaged , or necrotic leaves are removed . Delays in harvest can result in the head splitting as a result of expansion of the inner leaves and continued stem growth . Factors that contribute to reduced head weight include : growth in the compacted soils that result from no @-@ till farming practices , drought , waterlogging , insect and disease incidence , and shading and nutrient stress caused by weeds . 
 When being grown for seed , cabbages must be isolated from other B. oleracea subspecies , including the wild varieties , by 0 @.@ 8 to 1 @.@ 6 km ( 0 @.@ 5 to 1 mi ) to prevent cross @-@ pollination . Other Brassica species , such as B. rapa , B. <unk> , B. nigra , B. <unk> and Raphanus sativus , do not readily cross @-@ pollinate . 
 = = = Cultivars = = = 
 There are several cultivar groups of cabbage , each including many cultivars : 
 Savoy – Characterized by crimped or curly leaves , mild flavor and tender texture 
 Spring Greens – Loose @-@ headed , commonly sliced and steamed 
 Green – Light to dark green , slightly pointed heads . This is the most commonly grown cultivar . 
 Red – Smooth red leaves , often used for pickling or stewing 
 White , also called Dutch – Smooth , pale green leaves 
 Some sources only delineate three cultivars : savoy , red and white , with spring greens and green cabbage being subsumed into the latter .

 Due to its high level of nutrient requirements , cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies , including boron , calcium , phosphorus and potassium . There are several physiological disorders that can affect the <unk> appearance of cabbage . Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown , but the outer leaves look normal . Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib . In pepper spot , tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins , which can increase during storage . 
 Fungal diseases include <unk> , which causes weak or dying transplants ; Fusarium yellows , which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves ; and <unk> ( see <unk> <unk> ) , which leads to sunken areas on stems and gray @-@ brown spotted leaves . The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A. <unk> cause dark leaf spots in affected plants . They are both <unk> and airborne , and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest . <unk> solani causes the post @-@ emergence disease <unk> , resulting in killed seedlings ( " damping @-@ off " ) , root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads . 
 One of the most common bacterial diseases to affect cabbage is black rot , caused by <unk> campestris , which causes chlorotic and necrotic lesions that start at the leaf margins , and wilting of plants . <unk> , caused by the <unk> slime mold @-@ like organism <unk> brassicae , results in swollen , club @-@ like roots . Downy mildew , a parasitic disease caused by the oomycete <unk> parasitica , produces pale leaves with white , brownish or olive mildew on the lower leaf surfaces ; this is often confused with the fungal disease powdery mildew . 
 Pests include root @-@ knot nematodes and cabbage maggots , which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves ; aphids , which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves ; harlequin bugs , which cause white and yellow leaves ; thrips , which lead to leaves with white @-@ bronze spots ; striped flea beetles , which riddle leaves with small holes ; and caterpillars , which leave behind large , ragged holes in leaves . The caterpillar stage of the " small cabbage white butterfly " ( Pieris rapae ) , commonly known in the United States as the " imported cabbage worm " , is a major cabbage pest in most countries . The large white butterfly ( Pieris brassicae ) is prevalent in eastern European countries . The diamondback moth ( <unk> <unk> ) and the cabbage moth ( <unk> brassicae ) thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe , where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops . In India , the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide . Destructive soil insects include the cabbage root fly ( Delia <unk> ) and the cabbage maggot ( <unk> brassicae ) , whose larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans . 
 Planting near other members of the cabbage family , or where these plants have been placed in previous years , can prompt the spread of pests and disease . Excessive water and excessive heat can also cause cultivation problems . 
 = = Production = = 
 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) combines cabbage and other brassicas for reporting purposes . Total world production of all brassicas for calendar year 2012 was 70 @,@ 104 @,@ 972 metric tons ( 68 @,@ 997 @,@ 771 long tons ; 77 @,@ 277 @,@ 504 short tons ) . The nations with the largest production were China , which produced 47 percent of the world total , and India , which produced 12 percent . China and India used a surface area of 980 @,@ 000 hectares ( 2 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 acres ) and 375 @,@ 000 hectares ( 930 @,@ 000 acres ) , respectively , to grow these crops ; the total global surface area used for cabbage and related Brassica crops in 2012 was 2 @,@ 391 @,@ 747 hectares ( 5 @,@ 910 @,@ 140 acres ) . The largest yields were from South Korea , which harvested 71 @,@ 188 @.@ 6 kilograms per hectare , Ireland ( 68 @,@ 888 @.@ 9 kg / ha ) , and Japan ( 67 @,@ 647 @.@ 1 kg / ha ) . 
 Cabbages sold for market are generally smaller , and different varieties are used for those sold immediately upon harvest and those stored before sale . Those used for processing , especially sauerkraut , are larger and have a lower percentage of water . Both hand and mechanical harvesting are used , with hand @-@ harvesting generally used for cabbages destined for market sales . In commercial @-@ scale operations , hand @-@ harvested cabbages are trimmed , sorted , and packed directly in the field to increase efficiency . Vacuum cooling rapidly <unk> the vegetable , allowing for earlier shipping and a fresher product . Cabbage can be stored the longest at − 1 to 2 ° C ( 30 to 36 ° F ) with a humidity of 90 – 100 percent ; these conditions will result in up to six months of longevity . When stored under less ideal conditions , cabbage can still last up to four months .

 Cabbage consumption varies widely around the world : Russia has the highest annual per capita consumption at 20 kilograms ( 44 lb ) , followed by Belgium at 4 @.@ 7 kilograms ( 10 lb ) , the Netherlands at 4 @.@ 0 kilograms ( 8 @.@ 8 lb ) , and Spain at 1 @.@ 9 kilograms ( 4 @.@ 2 lb ) . Americans consume 3 @.@ 9 kilograms ( 8 @.@ 6 lb ) annually per capita . 
 Cabbage is prepared and consumed in many ways . The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it , though many cuisines pickle , stew , <unk> or <unk> cabbage . Pickling is one of the most popular ways of preserving cabbage , creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi , although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage ( B. rapa ) . Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads , while smooth @-@ leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing . Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking , while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat . In Poland , cabbage is one of the main food crops , and it features prominently in Polish cuisine . It is frequently eaten , either fresh or as sauerkraut , as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as <unk> ( stuffed cabbage ) and <unk> ( filled pasta ) . Other eastern European countries , such as Hungary and Romania , also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient . In India and Ethiopia , cabbage is often included in spicy salads and <unk> . In the United States , cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw , followed by market use and sauerkraut production . 
 The characteristic flavor of cabbage is caused by glucosinolates , a class of sulfur @-@ containing glucosides . Although found throughout the plant , these compounds are concentrated in the highest quantities in the seeds ; lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue , and they decrease as the tissue ages . Cooked cabbage is often criticized for its pungent , unpleasant odor and taste . These develop when cabbage is overcooked and hydrogen sulfide gas is produced . 
 = = Nutrients and phytochemicals = = 
 Cabbage is an excellent source of vitamin C and vitamin K , containing more than 20 % of the Daily Value ( DV ) for each of these nutrients per serving ( right table of USDA nutrient values ) . Cabbage is also a good source ( 10 – 19 % DV ) of vitamin B6 and folate , with no other nutrients having significant content per 100 gram serving ( table ) . 
 Basic research on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have anti @-@ disease effects . Such compounds include <unk> and other glucosinolates which may stimulate the production of detoxifying enzymes during metabolism . Studies suggest that cruciferous vegetables , including cabbage , may have protective effects against colon cancer . 
 Purple cabbage contains anthocyanins which are under preliminary research for potential anti @-@ carcinogenic properties . Cabbage is also a source of indole @-@ 3 @-@ <unk> , a chemical under basic research for its possible properties . 
 = = = Herbal medicine = = = 
 In addition to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable , cabbage has been used historically as a medicinal herb for a variety of purported health benefits . The Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative , and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning , for eye salves , and for <unk> used to help bruises heal . In Cato the Elder 's work De Agri Cultura ( " On Agriculture " ) , he suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage . The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable , recommending it for drunkenness — both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol , and to cure hangovers . Similarly , the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine . This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid @-@ 20th century . 
 The cooling properties of the leaves were used in Britain as a treatment for trench foot in World War I , and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses . Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts , and increase the duration of breast feeding . Other medicinal uses recorded in Europe folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism , sore throat , hoarseness , colic , and melancholy . In the United States , cabbage has been used as a hangover cure , to treat abscesses , to prevent sunstroke , or to cool body parts affected by fevers . The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and , when tied around the neck of children , to relieve croup . Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts , pneumonia , appendicitis , and ulcers .

 = Iron Duke @-@ class battleship = 
 The Iron Duke class was a group of four dreadnought battleships built for the British Royal Navy before the First World War . The class comprised four ships : Iron Duke , Marlborough , Benbow , and Emperor of India . Launched from October 1912 to November 1913 , this was the third class of Royal Navy super @-@ dreadnoughts . The ships were essentially repeats of the King George V @-@ class battleships ; they retained the same ten 13 @.@ 5 inch ( 34 @.@ 3 cm ) guns in five twin gun turrets on the centreline . However , the Iron Dukes had improved armour and a more powerful secondary armament of 6 @-@ inch weapons instead of the 4 @-@ inch mounted on the earlier ships . 
 The four ships were the most advanced battleships in the Royal Navy at the outbreak of the First World War , though they were soon surpassed by the five ships of the Queen Elizabeth class . They all saw extensive service during the war with the Grand Fleet , where Iron Duke acted as the flagship for the fleet commander , Admiral John Jellicoe . Three of the ships , Iron Duke , Benbow , and Marlborough , were present at the Battle of Jutland ; the Emperor of India missed the battle by being in dock for periodic refit . The four Iron Duke @-@ class battleships saw limited active duty following the end of the war ; they were all demilitarised under the terms of the London Naval Treaty signed in 1930 . Iron Duke was reduced to a training and depot ship and lasted in that role until 1946 when she was scrapped . Benbow was scrapped in 1931 and Marlborough followed in 1932 . Emperor of India was sunk as a gunnery target in 1931 .

 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Iron Duke @-@ class ships were 622 feet 9 inches ( 189 @.@ 9 metres ) long overall , and had a beam of 90 ft ( 27 @.@ 4 m ) and a draught of 29 ft ( 8 @.@ 8 m ) . This was an increase of 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 7 m ) in length and 1 ft ( .3 m ) in width over the preceding King George V @-@ class ships . The Iron Dukes displaced 25 @,@ 000 long tons ( 25 @,@ 400 tonnes ) . This was some 2 @,@ 000 tons ( 2 @,@ 032 tonnes ) heavier than the preceding King George Vs , and was primarily due to the increase in calibre of the secondary battery . 
 The ships were powered by four @-@ shaft Parsons turbines . Steam was provided to the turbines by 18 Babcock & Wilcox or Yarrow boilers . The engines were rated at 29 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower and delivered a top speed of 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ; 24 @.@ 7 mph ) . Iron Duke and her sisters had a fuel storage capacity of 3 @,@ 200 long tons ( 3 @,@ 300 t ) of coal and 1 @,@ 030 long tons ( 1 @,@ 050 t ) of oil . This enabled a maximum range of 7 @,@ 780 nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 410 km ; 8 @,@ 950 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 = = = = Primary battery = = = = 
 The Iron Duke @-@ class ships mounted a main battery of ten 13 @.@ 5 inch ( 34 @.@ 3 cm ) Mk V ( H ) guns in five twin gun turrets , all mounted on the centreline . Two turrets were placed in a superfiring pair forward ( " A " and " B " turrets ) , one turret amidships — the " Q " turret — directly after the two funnels , and two in a superfiring pair aft of the rear superstructure ( " X " and " Y " turrets ) . The gun houses used were Mk II turrets that weighed 600 tons ( 610 tonnes ) and allowed for depression to − 5 ° and elevation to 20 ° . Despite this , the range dials on the gunsights at the time of construction were graduated to 15 degrees ; super @-@ elevating cams and prisms to allow the full elevation of the guns to be used were issued some time after the Battle of Jutland . The forward and aft gun turrets could train 150 ° in either direction from the centreline , while the " Q " had a much more limited range . It could engage targets on an arc from between 30 ° to 150 ° from the centerline on either beam of the ship . 
 The guns had a rate of fire of between 1 @.@ 5 – 2 rounds per minute . The Mk V " Heavy " gun fired a variety of shells , including high explosive and armour @-@ piercing rounds ; they all weighed 1 @,@ 400 lb ( 635 kg ) . The guns were loaded with <unk> propellant charges that weighed 297 lb ( 135 kg ) ; these were stored in silk bags . This provided a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 491 fps ( 759 meters per second ) . At maximum elevation of 20 ° , the guns had a range of 23 @,@ 740 yards ( 21 @,@ 710 m ) , though at the maximum effective elevation of 15 ° , the range was somewhat shorter , at approximately 20 @,@ 000 yd ( 18 @,@ 290 m ) . At a range of 10 @,@ 000 yd ( 9 @,@ 144 m ) , the gun could penetrate up to 12 @.@ 5 in ( 318 mm ) of Krupp cemented steel armour , the type used on contemporary German dreadnoughts . 
 = = = = Secondary battery = = = = 
 The secondary battery consisted of twelve 6 @-@ inch ( 15 @.@ 2 cm ) Mk VII guns mounted in casemates in the hull around the forward superstructure . These guns were chosen because the 4 @-@ inch ( 10 @.@ 2 cm ) guns on earlier battleships were deemed to be too weak and have too short a range to effectively combat torpedo boats with newer , more powerful torpedoes . Admiral Jackie Fisher had opposed the idea of increasing the secondary battery , though he retired from the post of First Sea Lord in 1910 . As a result , the Iron Dukes , which were designed in 1911 , received the larger 6 inch gun . 
 These guns fired 100 lb ( 45 @.@ 4 kg ) shells at a rate of between 5 – 7 per minute . The shells were fired with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 775 fps ( 846 mps ) , though the guns were capable of higher velocities . It was reduced in order to standardize the performance of all the 6 inch guns in Royal Navy service , which would simplify range calculations for guns of the calibre . The guns could elevate to 20 ° , which enabled a maximum range of 15 @,@ 800 yd ( 14 @,@ 450 m ) . 
 There were some significant problems with the casemate guns early on , however . They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas . The plates were easily washed away , though , and without them , water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding . This problem was compounded by the fact that they had been mounted too low in the hull , which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas . The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates .

 Iron Duke was the first British battleship to be mounted with anti @-@ aircraft weaponry . In 1914 , two 3 in ( 7 @.@ 62 cm ) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure , primarily to defend against German airships . The guns fired between 12 – 14 rounds per minute , and were expected to fire approximately 1 @,@ 250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary . The shells fired were 12 @.@ 5 lb ( 5 @.@ 67 kg ) with a high @-@ explosive warhead . They were manually operated , and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23 @,@ 500 ft ( 7 @,@ 160 m ) . 
 As was customary for capital ships of the period , the Iron Duke @-@ class ships were equipped with submerged torpedo tubes . The ships carried four 21 in ( 53 @.@ 3 cm ) tubes , two on each beam . These launched Mk II torpedoes that carried a 515 lb ( 234 kg ) TNT warhead . They had two speed settings ; 31 kn ( 57 km / h ; 36 mph ) and 45 kn ( 83 km / h ; 52 mph ) . At 31 knots , the range was 10 @,@ 750 yd ( 9 @,@ 830 m ) , though at 45 kn the range was considerably reduced , to 4 @,@ 500 yd ( 4 @,@ 110 m ) . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The Iron Duke @-@ class battleships had an armour belt that was 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) thick in the central area of the ship , where the ammunition magazines , machinery spaces , and other vital parts of the ship were located . The belt tapered down to 102 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) towards the bow and stern . The barbettes that contained the main gun turrets were 254 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) on the sides and 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) on the rear , where shells were less likely to hit . The turrets themselves were 280 mm ( 11 in ) thick on the sides . The ships ' armoured deck was between 25 – 65 mm ( 1 – 2 @.@ 5 in ) thick . After the battle of Jutland in May 1916 , some 820 tonnes of armour was added to the ships , primarily to thicken the deck around the main battery turrets , as well as to increase the bulkheads in the ammunition magazines . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Iron Duke was laid down on 12 January 1912 in the Portsmouth Dockyard . She was launched exactly 10 months later , on 12 October 1912 ; fitting out work commenced thereafter , and was finished by March 1914 . She was then commissioned into the British Home Fleet , as the flagship of Admiral George Callaghan . Marlborough was the second ship of the class to be built . She followed Iron Duke by nearly two weeks ; Marlborough was laid down at the Devonport Dockyard on 25 January 1912 and launched on 24 October 1912 . Fitting out work proceeded somewhat slower on the ship , which wasn 't finished until June 1914 . 
 Benbow was laid down at Beardmore on 30 May 1912 , more than 5 months after her older sisters . She was launched on 12 November 1913 and completed by October 1914 . Emperor of India , the last of the four battleships , was originally ordered under the name Delhi . She was laid down at Vickers the day after Benbow , on 31 May 1912 . She was launched on 27 November 1913 , and completed by November 1914 .

 Upon commissioning , Iron Duke was assigned to the Home Fleet as the fleet flagship . After the outbreak of the First World War , the Royal Navy was reorganized ; the Home Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet were combined to form the Grand Fleet ; Iron Duke retained her position as fleet flagship , under John Jellicoe . The ship took part in all of the major fleet actions , though only one of them ended in combat — the sortie on 31 May that resulted in the Battle of Jutland . At Jutland , Iron Duke was assigned to the 3rd Division of the 4th Battle Squadron , and was stationed in the centre of the British line . 
 Following the end of the war , Iron Duke was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet . During 1919 – 20 , the ship operated in the Black Sea in support of the White Russians during the Russian Civil War . The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 mandated that Iron Duke be removed from the active roster . However , she remained with the fleet for a short time , having been transferred to the Atlantic Fleet in 1926 . This duty assignment lasted 3 years , after which she was removed from active service . She was demilitarised , to be used as a training ship . Two of her gun turrets and a good deal of her armour were removed , and her speed was reduced to 18 kn ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) through the removal of some of her boilers . She was later used as a depot ship in Scapa Flow , starting in 1939 . After the outbreak of the Second World War that year , her remaining guns were removed to be used in shore defences . Luftwaffe bombers attacked her on 17 October 1939 ; while they scored no direct hits , several near misses caused significant damage . After repairs were effected , the ship resumed her duties as a depot vessel until the end of the war . She was finally sold for scrapping in 1946 . 
 = = = Marlborough = = = 
 Marlborough was the most heavily engaged ship of the class during the battle of Jutland ; she fired a total of 162 heavy @-@ calibre shells , out of a total of 292 for the entire class . She was assigned to the 6th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron , towards the rear of the British line . She served as the flagship of Vice Admiral Cecil Burney . During the battle , she was hit by a torpedo amidships ; the torpedo tore a hole that was 21 m by 6 m ( 70 ft by 20 ft ) . Despite the damage , she was able to keep her position in the line , though her speed was reduced to 17 kn ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . Marlborough continued to fire her main guns until the list increased to the point that prevented her guns from being effectively employed . The ship eventually withdrew to the Humber , where she undertook 3 months of repairs . 
 Post @-@ war , Marlborough joined Iron Duke in the Mediterranean , where she remained until 1926 . She was then transferred to the Atlantic Fleet ; her tour of duty there lasted until 1929 , at which point she was withdrawn from active duty . The ship was sold for scrapping in 1932 .

 Like her sisters , Benbow was assigned to the Grand Fleet for the duration of the First World War . She was assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron on 10 December 1914 . Benbow was the flagship of Admiral Doveton Sturdee , the commander of the 4th Division of the 4th Battle Squadron , during the battle of Jutland . The 4th Division was directly ahead of the 3rd Division , where Admiral Jellicoe commanded the fleet from Benbow 's sister Iron Duke . Throughout the battle the ship remained undamaged . Like Iron Duke and Marlborough , Benbow was transferred to the Mediterranean in 1919 , and she provided artillery support to White Russian forces in the Black Sea . She followed Marlborough to the Atlantic Fleet in 1926 ; she too was stricken in 1929 and sold for scrap .

 Emperor of India was also assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron , in December 1914 . She missed Jutland because she was in dock for a periodic refit . After the end of the war , she was transferred to the Mediterranean along with the other three ships of the class . Emperor of India returned to England in 1922 for a refit , after which she resumed her duties in the Mediterranean . She likewise joined the Atlantic Fleet in 1926 , alongside her sisters , and stricken in 1929 . Instead of being scrapped , however , she was used as a gunnery target , and sunk in 1931 . She was raised shortly thereafter and sold to ship breakers on 6 February 1932 . 
 = USS New Ironsides = 
 USS New Ironsides was a wooden @-@ hulled broadside ironclad built for the United States Navy during the American Civil War . The ship spent most of her career blockading the Confederate ports of Charleston , South Carolina , and Wilmington , North Carolina , in 1863 – 65 . New Ironsides bombarded the fortifications defending Charleston in 1863 during the First and Second Battles of Charleston Harbor . At the end of 1864 and the beginning of 1865 she bombarded the defenses of Wilmington in the First and Second Battles of Fort Fisher . 
 Although she was struck many times by Confederate shells , gunfire never significantly damaged the ship or injured the crew . Her only casualty in combat occurred when she was struck by a spar torpedo carried by the CSS David . Eight crewmen were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in 1865 . The ship was destroyed by fire in 1865 after she was placed in reserve . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 After the United States received word of the construction of the Confederate casemate ironclad , CSS Virginia , Congress appropriated $ 1 @.@ 5 million on 3 August to build one or more armored steamships . It also ordered the creation of a board to inquire into armored ships . The U.S. Navy advertised for proposals for " iron @-@ clad steam vessels of war " on 7 August and Gideon Welles , the Secretary of the Navy , appointed the three members of the Ironclad Board the following day . Their task was to " examine plans for the completion of iron @-@ clad vessels " . They evaluated 17 different designs , but recommended only three on 16 September . 
 The three ironclad ships differed substantially in design and degree of risk . The USS Monitor was the most innovative design by virtue of its low freeboard , shallow @-@ draft iron hull , and total dependence on steam power . The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret , something that had not previously been tested by any navy . Its designer John Ericsson 's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved . The wooden @-@ hulled USS Galena 's most novel feature was her armor of interlocking iron rails . The New Ironsides was much influenced by the French ironclad Gloire and was the most conservative design of the three , which copied many of the features of the French ship . The well @-@ known Philadelphia engine @-@ building firm of Merrick & Sons made the proposal for New Ironsides , but they did not have a slipway so they subcontracted the ship to William Cramp and Sons . William Cramp claimed credit for the detailed design of the ship 's hull , but the general design work was done by Merrick & Sons . 
 New Ironsides was 230 feet ( 70 @.@ 1 m ) long between perpendiculars and 249 feet 6 inches ( 76 @.@ 0 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 57 feet 6 inches ( 17 @.@ 5 m ) and a draft of 15 feet 8 inches ( 4 @.@ 8 m ) . The ship displaced 4 @,@ 120 long tons ( 4 @,@ 190 t ) , 495 long tons ( 503 t ) more than her designed displacement . To minimize her draft , New Ironsides was given a wide beam and a flat bottom . She had a rectangular ram that projected 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) forward from her bow . The ship 's crew consisted of 449 officers and men . 
 A two @-@ piece articulated rudder was fitted to New Ironsides , but it proved unsatisfactory in service as the ship became more unmanageable as her speed increased . The rudder was blamed at the time , but the very full shape of the ship 's hull aft was the most likely cause as it screened the rudder from the flow of water behind the hull . The ship 's hull was coppered to reduce fouling . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 New Ironsides had two simple horizontal two @-@ cylinder direct @-@ acting steam engines driving a single brass 13 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) propeller . Steam was provided by four horizontal fire @-@ tube boilers at a working pressure of 20 – 25 psi ( 138 – 172 kPa ; 1 – 2 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines produced 1 @,@ 800 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 300 kW ) which gave the ship a maximum speed around 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) . New Ironsides carried 350 long tons ( 360 t ) of coal and her propeller could be disengaged to reduce drag while under sail alone . The ship was barque @-@ rigged with three masts that were used only for long @-@ distance voyages , and were removed , with their rigging , once on station . The best speed under sail and steam together was only about 7 knots ( 13 km / h ; 8 @.@ 1 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ship 's main armament was originally going to consist of 16 smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted on the gun deck . However , the navy was less than impressed by the performance of 9 @-@ inch Dahlgrens during the Battle of Hampton Roads and wanted more powerful 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) guns . Accordingly , the design changed while the ship was under construction to accommodate fourteen 11 @-@ inch Dahlgren guns and two muzzle @-@ loading 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) , 150 @-@ pounder Parrott rifles . Two 5 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) , 50 @-@ pound Dahlgren rifles were fitted on the upper deck as chase guns . They were replaced by 60 @-@ pound Dahlgren rifles by October 1864 . 
 Each 11 @-@ inch gun weighed approximately 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) . They could fire a 136 @-@ pound ( 61 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a range of 3 @,@ 650 yards ( 3 @,@ 340 m ) at an elevation of 15 ° . The muzzle @-@ loading Parrott rifles fired a 152 @-@ pound ( 68 @.@ 9 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 200 ft / s ( 370 m / s ) . The 17 @-@ caliber guns weighed 16 @,@ 300 pounds ( 7 @,@ 400 kg ) each . The 50 @-@ pounder Dahlgren rifles weighed approximately 5 @,@ 600 pounds ( 2 @,@ 500 kg ) . The small size of the gun ports limited the guns , however , to a maximum elevation of 4 @.@ 5 ° which reduced their range to less than 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) . 
 The existing wooden carriages for 11 @-@ inch guns were too long to fit in New Ironsides 's cramped battery . A new iron carriage was built where the gun rode in a cradle that slid on iron rails . The new carriages pivoted at the gun ports to minimize the size of the ports . Two compressors , or clamps , were fitted to squeeze the rails and increase friction between the rails and the cradle , but these were not strong enough to handle the recoil force when the gun was fired . Two more compressors were fitted as well as rope <unk> to restrain the guns , but neither was entirely satisfactory . The problem was not resolved until December 1862 when strips of ash wood were placed underneath the compressors ; the friction of iron on wood was double that of iron on iron and the increased friction solved the problem . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 New Ironsides had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick . Below the waterline it was reduced to 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . It reached 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) above the waterline and 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) below . Above the belt the 170 @-@ foot ( 51 @.@ 8 m ) battery was protected by 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch armor , but the bow and stern were left unprotected . Although not initially part of the design , transverse bulkheads were added during construction to protect the ends of the battery . They consisted of 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) of wrought iron backed by 12 inches ( 305 mm ) of white oak . The deck was three inches of yellow pine beneath 1 inch ( 25 mm ) of wrought iron . Mirroring French practice , the armor plates were secured to the ship 's hull and deck by countersunk screws . The armor plates were cut with a groove on each side and an iron bar was inserted between each plate to better distribute the shock of impact . The side armor was backed by 21 inches ( 533 mm ) of wood . A conning tower with three @-@ inch sides was also added during construction . It was placed behind the funnel and the mainmast , and had no visibility directly forward . It was small and could only fit three people . 
 Each of the ship 's gun ports was protected by two armored shutters , each 4 inches ( 102 mm ) thick . Each shutter rotated on an axle at its top operated from inside the battery . In combat these shutters frequently cracked or broke when hit ; rarely was a shutter jammed in either the open or closed position . 
 = = Construction = = 
 New Ironsides was named in honor of USS Constitution , which earned the nickname " Old Ironsides " during her engagement with HMS Guerrière in the War of 1812 . As Constitution herself was still in commission , the name was unavailable for a new ship . 
 Merrick & Sons was awarded a $ 780 @,@ 000 contract for the ship on 15 October 1861 for delivery in nine months . A $ 500 penalty was imposed for each day past 15 July 1862 that the ship was delayed . Commodore Charles Stewart sponsored the ship as she was launched on 10 May 1862 . She was commissioned on 21 August , but the navy did not invoke the penalty for late delivery . On 27 September the navy paid Merrick & Sons $ 34 @,@ 322 @.@ 06 for " extras " , presumably the armored bulkheads , shutters , and conning tower not included in the original specifications .

 The day after New Ironsides was commissioned , she sailed for Hampton Roads where Rear Admiral Goldsborough had been requesting her since July . He feared a Confederate sortie down the James River to attack his ships and did not believe that his armored sloop Galena and the prototype ironclad Monitor would be enough . On 31 August , Secretary Welles ordered New Ironsides back to Philadelphia for post @-@ trial repairs . Her voyage to Hampton Roads had revealed problems with her steering , gun recoil , and lack of speed . A start was made on the gun recoil problem when she was ordered to return to Hampton Roads on 23 September , but the other two problems proved to be intractable . She was kept ready to respond to a Confederate attack with steam up while mechanics were sent to fix the recoil problems and the crew was training . 
 New Ironsides joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Port Royal , South Carolina , on 17 January 1863 . When she first arrived , the ship exchanged her masts and rigging for poles suitable for signaling . Rear Admiral Du Pont ordered that the ship 's funnel be cut down to improve the visibility from the conning tower , but the fumes from the funnel nearly asphyxiated the men in the conning tower and on the gun deck , and the funnel had to be restored . He also attempted to move the 18 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 18 t ) conning tower to a better position , but it was too heavy for the equipment available . 
 The day after the Confederate casemate ironclads CSS <unk> and CSS Palmetto State sortied and briefly captured two Union ships on 31 January , New Ironsides was ordered to patrol off Charleston Harbor . The ship remained at Charleston for the rest of the year except for brief intervals at Port Royal . She participated in the First Battle of Charleston Harbor on 7 April 1863 , when nine Union ironclads entered the harbor and conducted a prolonged , but inconclusive , bombardment of Fort Sumter . New Ironsides served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Du Pont during the battle . He and his staff occupied the conning tower during the engagement , which forced the ship 's captain to command the ship from the gun deck . Admiral Du Pont 's pilot was unfamiliar with New Ironsides ' quirks , and the channel used during the attack was shallower in places than her deep draft ; she maneuvered erratically and had to anchor several times to avoid going aground . The monitors Catskill and Nantucket collided with New Ironsides as they attempted to move past her , but no damage was suffered by any of the ships . As the ship was withdrawing she anchored directly over a Confederate " torpedo " ( mine ) that was filled with 3 @,@ 000 pounds ( 1 @,@ 360 kg ) of gunpowder that failed to detonate . During the bombardment New Ironsides fired only a single broadside , but she was hit over 50 times in return without significant damage or casualties . 
 New Ironsides repeatedly bombarded Confederate positions in the successful campaign to take Fort Wagner on Morris Island beginning with the Second Battle of Fort Wagner on 18 July through the next two months and the Second Battle of Charleston Harbor . During this time the ship was the target of a failed spar torpedo boat attack on 21 August . While resupplying ammunition on 8 September , New Ironsides was called to provide cover for the monitor Weehawken which had grounded between Fort Sumter and Cummings Point . New Ironsides anchored 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) in front of Fort Moultrie and forced the Confederate gunners to seek cover ; she fired 483 shells and was struck at least 70 times . The ship also contributed crewmen for the landing party that unsuccessfully attempted to seize Fort Sumter on the night of 8 – 9 September . Between July and October New Ironsides fired 4439 rounds and was hit by at least 150 heavy projectiles , none of which inflicted any significant damage or casualties . 
 Another spar torpedo attack was made by the semi @-@ submersible CSS David on the night of 5 October 1863 . The attack was successful , but the damage was minor , and only one man later died of his wounds . New Ironsides remained on station until 6 June 1864 when she returned to Port Royal preparatory to a return to Philadelphia for repairs and a general overhaul . Her masts and rigging were replaced and most of the ship 's crew with time remaining on their enlistments were transferred to other ships in the squadron . The ship arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 24 June and was decommissioned six days later to begin her refit . 
 New Ironsides completed her overhaul in late August 1864 , now under the command of Commodore William Radford , but did not join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in Hampton Roads until October when her crew finished gunnery training . She participated in a major assault in December on Fort Fisher , North Carolina , in an effort to stop blockade running into the port of Wilmington . Though this attack was called off on Christmas Day after an extensive bombardment , the Union fleet returned to resume the operation on 13 January 1865 . New Ironsides was one of several warships that heavily shelled Fort Fisher , preparing the way for a ground assault that captured the position on 15 January . Afterward and for the next few months , New Ironsides supported Union activities on the James River . She was decommissioned on 6 April 1865 and was laid up at League Island , Philadelphia , where , on the night of 16 December 1865 , New Ironsides was destroyed by a fire . The ship was towed to shallow water where she burned and sank . Her wreck was salvaged and her boilers were offered for sale in 1869 .

 Mass Effect 2 is an action role @-@ playing game where the player assumes the role of Commander Shepard . Shepard 's gender , appearance , history and combat @-@ training are determined by the player before the game begins . The game features a variety of missions that the player must complete to progress . During the missions , Shepard is usually assisted by two AI squad members that the player can indirectly control through orders . Combat takes place in real @-@ time , but the player can pause the game at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use . Unlike most of the missions , Arrival introduces a new assignment that involves Shepard to fight solo almost the entire time , even though there is a short section where the player is assisted by a character . The mission also contains three in @-@ game upgrades that the player can research to enhance aspects of the game 's weapons and armor , as well as three new achievements . The first achievement requires the player to complete the first part of the mission without being detected by enemies ; the second achievement involves the player to survive all the waves in a specific battle ; and the third one is unlocked by completing Arrival . Upon completing the mission , the player is awarded with experience points . If a sufficient amount of experience is obtained , the player can upgrade powers of the entire squad . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mass Effect 2 : Arrival is set within the Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century , where interstellar travel is possible through the use of mass transit devices called Mass Relays . Commander Shepard is sent on a mission to rescue Dr. Amanda Kenson , an allied agent who claimed to have found evidence of an imminent invasion of Reapers , a highly advanced machine race of synthetic @-@ organic starships encountered in the first Mass Effect game . Shepard successfully rescues Kenson , who explains that she discovered a Reaper artifact which gave her visions of the imminent invasion . Shepard asks to see the proof and is taken to the artifact , which is located inside a complex on the surface of a large asteroid . Upon arriving at the artifact , Shepard has a vision of the Reaper fleet approaching a Relay . Just as Shepard starts to get up from the experience , Kenson detains and imprisons him / her in a medical lab . It is then revealed that despite her stated precautions , Kenson and her entire team became indoctrinated from having spent too much time studying the artifact . 
 Shepard eventually manages to escape the medical lab and reach the control room , where he / she sets the asteroid on course to hit the Relay from where the Reapers will soon be coming . In retaliation , Kenson plans to destroy the asteroid by overloading the reactor core of the facility , but Shepard ultimately stops her . Shepard then contacts his / her starship and escapes shortly before the asteroid hits the Relay , resulting in the destruction of an entire system . Shepard is later met by Admiral Steven Hackett , their superior officer , who explains that he / she has to go to Earth and face the consequences , setting the stage for Mass Effect 3 .

 Mass Effect 2 : Arrival was developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts . During development of Mass Effect 2 , Bioware stated that downloadable content was becoming a fundamental part of the company 's overall philosophy . The pack was accidentally revealed on February 21 , 2011 by the addition of three new achievements in a patch for the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 . BioWare later stated that the addition of the achievements was intentional , but assumed they would be " invisible " . On March 14 , 2011 , the pack was formally confirmed to be in development via a brand new screenshot . BioWare explained that its purpose is to act as a bridge for Mass Effect 3 . Although the base where most of the pack 's events take place is located on an asteroid , early plans suggested that it would be set on an ocean planet . The base would be underwater and Shepard would reach the main level by submarine . Each section of the base would be in different " containers " , and would have a similar sense to James Cameron 's 1989 film The Abyss . The pack was released on March 29 , 2011 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 . The soundtrack was composed by Sonic Mayhem duo Sascha Dikiciyan and Cris Velasco , the same composers that penned the music from Mass Effect 2 's earlier downloadable content Kasumi - Stolen Memory .

 Mass Effect 2 : Arrival received generally mixed reviews from critics . GameSpot Senior Editor Kevin VanOrd called Arrival " a disappointing conclusion to a beloved series ' second chapter . " He stated that the pack lacks elements of choice and character development , which are core features of the Mass Effect series . He nonetheless found the atmospheric environments still praiseworthy , especially the final battleground , which " seems to break the laws of physics but nonetheless gives the shooting excellent visual context . " Kristine Steimer of IGN enjoyed the challenge of fighting alone , as it " never bordered on frustrating " , but also admitted the pack fundamentally consisted of linear combat sequences . 
 Game Revolution 's Eduardo Reboucas mainly criticized the story . He felt that " characters don 't offer a lot of explanation and the little that is given seems more like a hastily put @-@ together excuse to shoot up some fools and push some buttons on the way . " He also pointed out that none of the conversation paths influence the game , and " [ give ] no sense of closure or importance . " Despite the criticism , he praised BioWare 's talent for the pack 's great atmosphere , stating " you 'll never be bored by the visuals in The Arrival . " 
 Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer highlighted positively the first part of the mission . He remarked the game " [ does ] a decent job of allowing you to feel like you 're being stealthy as you negotiate your way past guards , usually by looking around for not @-@ very @-@ hidden alternate routes . " He however criticized the final two thirds for being very linear and repetitive , and also reacted negatively to the game 's insistence on having to fight solo almost the entire time . He explained that Mass Effect 2 is a squad game , where players " [ use ] fluid team strategy to cope with different situations " , but fighting solo means that players " have to deal with every encounter in the exact same way . " Brad Gallaway , reviewer of GameCritics , concluded that the relatively short mission and included extras were not enough to justify the pack 's $ 7 USD price tag . Mass Effect 2 : Arrival was nominated for Best DLC ( downloadable content ) at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards , but lost to Portal 2 : Peer Review .

 Atalante was laid down at Cherbourg in June 1865 and launched on 12 April 1867 . Her sea trials began on 1 April 1869 and she joined the reserve at Brest on 11 July 1869 . Atalante was commissioned on 23 February 1870 and was initially assigned to the Evolutionary Squadron before transferring to the Northern Squadron in July 1870 at the outbreak of the Franco @-@ Prussian War . The squadron was ordered to lift its blockade of the Prussian North Sea ports on 16 September and return to Cherbourg . Atalante went back into reserve in November 1870 , but she was recommissioned the following year . 
 She was named as the flagship of the Pacific Squadron on 1 July 1872 under command of Rear Admiral Baron Roussin . On 14 August Atalante sailed from Lorient for the Pacific and did not return until 27 February 1874 . She was placed into reserve upon her arrival , but was recommissioned on 28 December 1875 as the flagship of the China Squadron under Rear Admiral Veron . She departed Lorient on 10 January 1876 , but returned on 16 May 1878 . The ship spent the next four years in reserve before being recommissioned on 3 July 1882 for service with the Cochinchina Division ( French : division navale de <unk> ) . 
 Atalante was transferred to the new Tonkin Coast Division ( French : division navale des <unk> du Tonkin ) when it was formed in 1883 . During 18 – 21 August 1883 she participated in the Battle of Thuan An . This was an attack by the French on the forts defending the mouth of the Perfume River , leading to the Vietnamese capital of Huế in an attempt to intimidate the Vietnamese government . Atalante was assigned to bombard the North Fort by the French commander , Vice Admiral Amédée Courbet . After two days of bombardment a landing party from the ship captured the fort .

 The ship was assigned to the Far East Squadron ( French : escadre de l 'Extrême @-@ Orient ) under Admiral Courbet when it was formed by the amalgamation of the Tonkin Coast and Far Eastern Divisions in June 1884 in preparation for the Sino @-@ French War of 1884 – 85 . In early September 1884 Atalante was in Huế , but she carried Admiral Courbet to Keelung on 23 September . The ship was paid off into reserve in Saigon in 1885 and condemned two years later . She fell into such a state of disrepair that " she foundered one night and gradually sank into the mud . " 
 = Santa Santita = 
 Santa Santita , or Magdalena , The Unholy Saint , is a 2004 Filipino film starring Angelica Panganiban and Jericho Rosales , directed by Laurice Guillen . The film follows Malen , the daughter of an intercessor , her love affair with a hustler and gigolo , and her confrontation of the evil within her life . Based on a script by Jerry <unk> , the film was picked up by Guillen in 2000 but did not start production because an appropriate actress for Malen could not be found . After picking Panganiban , Guillen began work , and the eventual film was released on November 17 , 2004 , in the Philippines and March 11 , 2005 , internationally . Receiving good reviews from Variety and the Philippine Daily Inquirer , Santa Santita was one of only two films to be rated as Grade A by the Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines , and represented the Philippines at the <unk> festival in Italy and the Bangkok International Film Festival . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Malen ( Angelica Panganiban ) is the daughter of <unk> ( Hilda <unk> ) , a widowed intercessor at Quiapo Church in Manila . Selling religious charms as a way of meeting men , Malen falls for Mike ( Jericho Rosales ) , a gigolo and hustler . Mike hustles both for his own survival and that of his son , but also because " he knows essentially he 's just strong enough and unscrupulous enough " to do so . After her mother takes umbrage at Malen 's assumed promiscuity , she moves out of <unk> 's house and stays with Mike . When her mother then dies of a heart attack , Malen feels guilt and becomes an intercessor despite having previously sworn the profession off . 
 Initially met with mistrust by her colleagues , one of whom exclaims that " She is defiling prayer " , Malen heals a child with a hole in its heart through her prayers , despite not even praying seriously . This meets with additional hostility , both from the other intercessors and the clergy , and when Malen dreams of having stigmata , she is forced to confront the problems with her own life , something which comes to a climax when she is asked to bring Mike 's dead son back to life . A side plot involves Father Tony ( Johnny Delgado ) , an alcoholic priest who lives with Mike . Initially his drinking partner , Mike begins to taunt the priest about his failures as the film goes on . At the end of the film , Mike is sent to prison for killing a man after a traffic accident , while Tony 's interactions with Malen convince him that he is addicted to alcohol , prompting him to return to his parish and continue serving as a priest .

 The script was written by Jerry <unk> , influenced by the poem The Hound of Heaven , and won first prize at the scriptwriting competition hosted by the Film Development Council of the Philippines in 2000 . This attracted the attention of Laurice Guillen , who bought the script ( the first time in her career that she had done so ) and signed on to direct the eventual film . The script was brought to Star Cinema , who became interested in producing it , but production stalled due to difficulties finding an appropriate actress to play Malen . Guillen stated that " Since she was a Magdalene , she had to be sexy but she also had to be much more than that .... I was shown many sexy actresses , some of them name stars , but I couldn 't find my Santa @-@ Santita . I felt that the role should go to someone relatively new , who had no fixed image , so that there would be no expectations " . An additional problem was over the religious content of the film , which met with controversy . Guillen eventually found Angelica Panganiban to play Malen , and after five years without production , work on the film began for <unk> Pictures International , whose CEO stated that " the majority of Filipinos , the so @-@ called masses , are not the targets of this movie . Those who frequent the <unk> and look for fresh material in the movies are " . The title , Santa Santita , translates as " saint who is not really a saint " . 
 The scenes were primarily shot in Quiapo , Manila , church scenes were recorded in <unk> and dream sequences in <unk> , Ilocos Norte . Guillen noted the stress of recording in Quiapo , due to the large number of extras , the already crowded nature of the area and the small size of the time periods during which they were allowed to film in the church itself .

 The film was previewed to good reviews , and after an initial release in the Philippines on November 17 , 2004 , opened in cinemas in Manhattan , San Diego and Honolulu on March 11 , 2005 , as Magdalena , The Unholy Saint . It was given good reviews by both Filipino and American magazines and newspapers ; Variety magazine 's reviewer noted that " Performances are solid , and former child actress Panganiban is impressive as a young woman who finds herself with a vocation she never asked for ....

 Other reviewers were more cautionary ; the New York Times wrote that " the aim of the filmmaker seems unclear , with Magdalena at first celebrated for her <unk> and then exalted for her sudden saintliness " and describing the story as " <unk> eventful " . The Manila Bulletin noted that while the film is about belief ( or lack thereof ) in miracles , " the effort to explore this issue is not brought into fulfilling fruition . We keep on hoping something else more significant would happen later in the film to invoke the viewers own feelings about faith and an all @-@ seeing , all @-@ merciful God , but this never comes " . Although Rosales and Panganiban were praised for their acting , the reviewer felt that there was " just no combustible chemistry between the two of them " . 
 The Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines gave the film a Grade A rating , making it one of only two films to qualify into that category at that point , and the only film to qualify in 2004 . This rating gave Santa Santita a 100 percent rebate on amusement taxes , and is only awarded to films that the Board feels can " revitalize the moribund industry " . The movie represented the Philippines at the <unk> festival in Italy , and was also shown at the Sine ! Sine ! Film Fest in San Francisco . It was a finalist in the Catholic Mass Media Awards , and represented the Philippines at the Bangkok International Film Festival . 
 = Ismet Popovac = 
 Dr. Ismet Popovac ( died 21 August 1943 ) was a Bosnian Muslim ( Bosniak ) military commander who led a Muslim Chetnik militia known as the Muslim People 's Military Organization ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> nacionalna <unk> organizacija , MNVO ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War II . A physician and lawyer by profession , he was a member of a cultural society known as <unk> prior to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941 . He was also the mayor of the town of Konjic prior to the invasion and was allegedly a candidate for Vladko Maček 's electoral list , but was left without a job in the Yugoslav state government after the creation of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939 . 
 In 1941 , Popovac joined the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović . As a proponent of Bosnian Muslim collaboration with the Chetniks , he suggested that the Chetniks recruit Muslims into their ranks . In October 1942 , he enlisted Italian aid in fighting the Yugoslav Partisans , and later visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre took the lives of 543 – 2 @,@ 500 Muslim and Croat civilians . In early 1943 he led an attack against a Muslim village , before being killed by either the Partisans , Chetniks , or an assassin in the vicinity of the town of Trebinje later that year . 
 = = Early life = = 
 From the Herzegovinian town of Nevesinje , Ismet Popovac was a physician and lawyer by profession . He finished medical school in Belgrade and was a vocal supporter of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during this time . Prior to the outbreak of World War II he was a member of the pro @-@ Serb and pro @-@ monarchy cultural society known as <unk> , whose members were often persecuted by non @-@ Serbs because of their political inclinations . Popovac was also the mayor of the Bosnian town of Konjic , and allegedly a candidate for Vladko Maček 's electoral list , but was left without a job in the state government after the creation of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939 . 
 = = Joining the Chetniks = = 
 On 6 April 1941 , Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia . Poorly equipped and poorly trained , the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated . Afterwards , Yugoslavia was dismembered , with Serbia being reduced to its pre @-@ 1912 borders and placed under a government of German military occupation . Milan Nedić , a pre @-@ war politician who was known to have pro @-@ Axis leanings , was then selected by the Germans to lead the collaborationist Government of National Salvation in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia . Meanwhile , the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Pavelić , who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini 's Italy , was appointed Poglavnik ( leader ) of an Ustaše @-@ led Croatian state – the Independent State of Croatia ( often called the NDH , from the Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska ) . The NDH combined almost all of modern @-@ day Croatia , all of modern @-@ day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern @-@ day Serbia into an " Italian @-@ German quasi @-@ protectorate . " NDH authorities , led by the Ustaše militia , subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb , Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state . As a result , two resistance movements emerged – the royalist and Serb Chetniks , led by Colonel Draža Mihailović , and the multi @-@ ethnic , Communist Yugoslav Partisans , led by Josip Broz Tito . 
 That year , Popovac and fellow Muslim leader Mustafa Pašić joined the Chetniks . Popovac hoped to achieve independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina through his cooperation and , according to one Serb Chetnik , his " main goal was to protect the Muslims , rather than to struggle for the Serb nation and Serb affairs . " He later wrote to Mihailović , suggesting that Bosnian Muslims be recruited into the Chetnik ranks . This proposal was met with support from pro @-@ Serb , anti @-@ Communist Muslim leaders in several Bosnian towns . However , as more Muslims began joining the Partisans , the Chetniks increasingly began considering Muslims to be their enemies . Chetnik atrocities against Muslim civilians subsequently increased in the late spring of 1941 . Due to these actions , and due to Muslims , especially those in eastern Bosnia , being branded by the Chetniks as " Turks " and " Ustaše cronies , " the Chetniks found few Muslim recruits . 
 = = Muslim People 's Military Organization = = 
 In late 1942 , a Muslim Chetnik militia known as the Muslim People 's Military Organization ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> nacionalna <unk> organizacija , MNVO ) was formed in Herzegovina following a meeting between Popovac and Bosnian Serb Chetnik leaders Dobroslav Jevđević and Petar Baćović . The militia was placed under the control of Popovac , <unk> <unk> and Mustafa Pašić . It was part of a greater Muslim autonomist circle and in September 1942 an assembly of Herzegovinian Muslim notables in Mostar declared : " We <unk> and Bosnians are nobody 's property and we recognize the right of nobody to persecute us ; so , insofar as our brothers in Zagreb do not wish to accede to our demands , we shall seek protection of our interests from other big powers from the ranks of our allies . " In October of that year , Popovac enlisted Italian aid in fighting the Yugoslav Partisans . This resulted in the establishment of a Bosnian Muslim quisling force that operated as part of the Anti @-@ Communist Volunteer Militia . It was reported that Popovac had " won the majority of the Muslims to his purpose " in the Mostar , Konjic , Nevesinje and Gacko districts . Eventually , he came to be seen as one of " the principal representatives of the pro @-@ Chetnik Muslim current " in Bosnia . 
 That October , during Operation Alfa , a joint Chetnik – Italian attack against the Partisans , the Chetniks massacred 543 – 2 @,@ 500 Muslim and Croat civilians in Prozor . Several days later , Popovac arrived in the town to console the Bosnian Muslim population and to advise the Chetniks there against committing further atrocities . While there , he also attempted to convince local Muslims to join the Chetnik ranks , but was unsuccessful due to the extent of Chetnik atrocities against the Muslim population . On 31 December , in face of widespread Muslim opposition to the Chetniks ' genocidal nature , Popovac and his MNVO declared a resolution in Kalinovik , vowing allegiance to King Petar II and Mihailović , and claiming Bosnian Muslims as " an integral part of Serbdom " and the MNVO as " part of the Chetnik movement led by Draža Mihailović , Minister of the Army , Navy and Air Forces . " 
 In January 1943 , Popovac led an attack which resulted in the capture of a Muslim village that was guarded by a large force of Muslim volunteers . That same month more Chetnik massacres against Bosnian Muslims were carried out , especially in east Bosnia in the areas of Koraj , Bijeljina , Srebrenica , Višegrad , Foča , Goražde , Vlasenica , and around the Drina river . His militia cooperated with Chetnik units in fighting the Partisans during the Axis @-@ led Case White operation in January to March 1943 , but did not distinguish itself . During the operation itself Chetniks continued their efforts to exterminate the Muslims . Nonetheless , Popovac and Pašić continued seeking Muslim recruits . They declared in their " Address to the Brethren Muslims of Čajniče and Other Nearby Districts " that the main goal of the Chetniks was " the intelligent and honest protection of Muslim interests " and " securing a safe future for our people with the highest principles of Islam : freedom of religion , holiness of the family , respect for private property , social justice , and democratic political freedom . " Furthermore , they dismissed the claim that Muslims were collectively responsible for Ustaše crimes and said " Muslims are bound to the brethren of the Orthodox religion by blood and land . " 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Popovac was killed on 21 August 1943 . Sources vary on the circumstances of his death . Historian Marko Attila Hoare states that he was killed by members of the Partisan 10th Herzegovinian Brigade , Professor Jozo Tomasevich writes that he was killed by an assassin and Zdravko <unk> and Mihael <unk> claim that he was killed by the Chetniks in the vicinity of Trebinje after objecting to the killing of Muslims . 
 By December 1943 , it is estimated that 4 @,@ 000 of Mihailović 's Chetniks were Bosnian Muslims . This number accounted for eight percent of all of Mihailović 's soldiers . In 1944 , Mihailović appealed to the Muslims to fight against the Communists , citing the example of Popovac and other Muslim Chetniks . 
 = Paavo Nurmi = 
 Paavo Johannes Nurmi ( Finnish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 13 June 1897 – 2 October 1973 ) was a Finnish middle- and long @-@ distance runner . He was nicknamed the " Flying Finn " as he dominated distance running in the early 20th century . Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres , and won nine gold and three silver medals in his twelve events in the Olympic Games . At his peak , Nurmi was undefeated at distances from 800 m upwards for 121 races . Throughout his 14 @-@ year career , he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10 @,@ 000 m . 
 Born into a working @-@ class family , Nurmi left school at 12 to provide for his family . In 1912 , he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program . Nurmi started to flourish during his military service , setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics . After a silver medal in the 5000 m , he took gold in the 10 @,@ 000 m and the cross country events . In 1923 , Nurmi became the first , and so far only , runner to hold the world record in the mile , the 5000 m and the 10 @,@ 000 m races at the same time . He went on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races , and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics . Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave , Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals , but embittered , as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10 @,@ 000 m . 
 Struggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925 , Nurmi found his long @-@ time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers . At the 1928 Summer Olympics , Nurmi recaptured the 10 @,@ 000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase . He then turned his attention to longer distances , breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25 @-@ mile marathon . Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal , as his idol Kolehmainen had done . In a controversial case that strained Finland – Sweden relations and sparked an inter @-@ IAAF battle , Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status . Two days before the opening ceremonies , the council rejected his entries . Although he was never declared a professional , Nurmi 's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running . 
 Nurmi later coached Finnish runners , raised funds for Finland during the Winter War , and worked as a haberdasher , building contractor , and share trader , eventually becoming one of Finland 's richest people . In 1952 , he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki . Nurmi 's speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the " Phantom Finn " , while his achievements , training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle and long distance runners . Nurmi , who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand , has been credited for introducing the " even pace " strategy and analytic approach to running , and for making running a major international sport . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Nurmi was born in Turku , Finland , to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda <unk> Laine . Nurmi 's siblings , <unk> , <unk> , Martti and Lahja , were born in 1898 , 1902 , 1905 and 1908 , respectively . In 1903 , the Nurmi family moved from <unk> into a 40 @-@ square @-@ meter apartment in central Turku , where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932 . The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long @-@ distance runner Alfred <unk> . They regularly ran or walked six kilometres ( four miles ) to swim in <unk> , and back , sometimes twice a day . By the age of eleven , Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5 : 02 . Nurmi 's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later . The family struggled financially , renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room . Nurmi , a talented student , left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery . Although he stopped running actively , he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku . He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles . 
 At 15 , Nurmi rekindled his interest in athletics after being inspired by the performances of Hannes Kolehmainen , who was said to " have run Finland onto the map of the world " at the 1912 Summer Olympics . He bought his first pair of sneakers a few days later . Nurmi trained primarily by doing cross country running in the summers and cross country skiing in the winters . In 1914 , Nurmi joined the sports club <unk> <unk> and won his first race on the 3000 metres . Two years later , he revised his training program to include walking , sprints and calisthenics . He continued to provide for his family through his new job at the Ab . H. Ahlberg & Co workshop in Turku , where he worked until he started his military service at a machine gun company in the Pori Brigade in April 1919 . During the Finnish Civil War in 1918 , Nurmi remained politically passive and concentrated on his work and his Olympic ambitions . After the war , he decided not to join the newly founded Finnish Workers ' Sports Federation , but wrote articles for the federation 's chief organ and criticized the discrimination against many of his fellow workers and athletes . 
 In the army , Nurmi quickly impressed in the athletic competitions : While others marched , Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle on his shoulder and a backpack full of sand . Nurmi 's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non @-@ commissioned officers , but he was favoured by the superior officers , despite his refusal to take the soldier 's oath . As the unit commander Hugo <unk> was a known sports aficionado , Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice . Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks ; he ran behind trains , holding on to the rear bumper , to stretch his stride , and used heavy iron @-@ clad army boots to strengthen his legs . Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection . In March 1920 , he was promoted to corporal ( <unk> ) . On 29 May 1920 , he set his first national record on the 3000 m and went on to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July .

 Nurmi made his international debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp , Belgium . He took his first medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m . This would remain the only time that Nurmi lost to a non @-@ Finnish runner in the Olympics . He went on to win gold medals in his other three events : the 10 @,@ 000 m , sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute , the cross country race , beating Sweden 's Eric Backman , and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor <unk> defeat the British and Swedish teams . Nurmi 's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku . Nurmi , however , was given a scholarship to study at the <unk> industrial school in Helsinki . 
 Buoyed by his defeat to Guillemot , Nurmi 's races became a series of experiments which he analyzed meticulously . Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps , Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance . He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to a point where the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless . Nurmi set his first world record on the 10 @,@ 000 m in Stockholm in 1921 . In 1922 , he broke the world records for the 2000 m , the 3000 m and the 5000 m . A year later , Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile . His feat of holding the world records for the mile , the 5000 m and the 10 @,@ 000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since . Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m , winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record . After excelling in mathematics , Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games . 
 Nurmi 's trip to the 1924 Summer Olympics was endangered by a knee injury in the spring of 1924 , but he recovered and resumed training twice a day . On 19 June , Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the <unk> Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour , setting new world records for both distances . In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris , Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster . His only challenger , Ray Watson of the United States , gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy <unk> , Henry Stallard and Douglas Lowe , still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds . The 5000 m final started in less than two hours , and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola , who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10 @,@ 000 m . Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world @-@ record pace . Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock , Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass . The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel . On the home straight , Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind . 
 In the cross country events , the heat of 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ) , caused all but 15 of the 38 competitors to abandon the race . Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers . One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium , until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious . Early leader Wide was among those who blacked out along the course , and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital . Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half . As Finland looked to have lost the team medal , the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium , but was barely moving forward . An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish , and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track , thinking he had reached the finish line . After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while , he turned into the right direction , realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold . Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed , and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games . 
 In the 3000 m team race on the next day , Nurmi and Ritola again finished first and second , and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth . Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events , but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10 @,@ 000 m , the distance that was dearest to him . After returning to Finland , Nurmi set a 10 @,@ 000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years . He now held the 1500 m , the mile , the 3000 m , the 5000 m and the 10 @,@ 000 m world records simultaneously . 
 = = = U.S. tour and 1928 Olympics = = = 
 In early 1925 , Nurmi embarked on a widely publicised tour of the United States . He competed in 55 events ( 45 indoors ) during a five @-@ month period , starting at a sold @-@ out Madison Square Garden on 6 January . His debut was a copy of his feats in Helsinki and Paris . Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m , again setting new world records for both distances . Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances . He won 51 of the events , abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event ; a half @-@ mile race at the Yankee Stadium , where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich . Helffrich 's victory ended Nurmi 's 121 @-@ race , four @-@ year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards . Although he hated losing more than anything , Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich . The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States , and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House . Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out . 
 Nurmi struggled to maintain motivation for running , heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems . He quit his job as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively . As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer , his financial advisors included Risto Ryti , director of the Bank of Finland . In 1926 , Nurmi broke Wide 's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm , despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide . Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again . In October 1926 , he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany 's Otto Peltzer . This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m . In 1927 , Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland @-@ Sweden international , cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna . Nurmi ended his season and threatened , until late November , to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics . At the 1928 Olympic trials , Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino <unk> , and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances . He added steeplechase to his program , although he had only tried the event twice before , the latest being a two @-@ mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships . 
 At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam , Nurmi competed in three events . He won the 10 @,@ 000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past him on the home straight . Before the 5000 m final , Nurmi injured himself in his qualifying heat for the 3000 m steeplechase . He fell on his back at the water jump , spraining his hip and foot . Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up , and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win , which Duquesne gracefully refused . In the 5000 m , Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead . Nurmi , looking more exhausted than ever before , only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver . Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day . Struggling with the hurdles , Nurmi let Finland 's steeplechase specialist Toivo <unk> escape into the distance . On the final lap , he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world @-@ record setting <unk> ; Nurmi 's time also bettered the previous record . Although Ritola did not finish , Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals . 
 = = = Move to longer distances = = = 
 Nurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that " this is absolutely my last season on the track . I am beginning to get old . I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it . " However , Nurmi continued running , turning his attention to longer distances . In October , he broke the world records for the 15 km , the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin . Nurmi 's one @-@ hour record stood for 17 years , until <unk> Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945 . In January 1929 , Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn . He suffered his first @-@ ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile . Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925 , and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him . In 1930 , he set a new world record for the 20 km . In July 1931 , Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen , Lauri Virtanen and <unk> Iso @-@ <unk> , and breaking the world record on the now @-@ rare two miles . He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes . Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10 @,@ 000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles , stating that he " won 't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event . " 
 In April 1932 , the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation ( IAAF ) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation . The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing , but agreed to launch an investigation . It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch , and the Associated Press wrote that " there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question . " A week later , the Finnish <unk> Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi , finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism . Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games . 
 On 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials . Not drinking a drop of liquid , he ran the old @-@ style ' short marathon ' of 40 @.@ 2 km ( 25 miles ) in 2 : 22 : 03 @.@ 8 — on the pace to finish in about 2 : 29 : 00 , just under Albert Michelsen 's marathon world record of 2 : 29 : 01 @.@ 8 . At the time , he led Armas Toivonen , the eventual Olympic bronze medalist , by six minutes . Nurmi 's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon . Confident that he had done enough , Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon . The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10 @,@ 000 m and the marathon . The Guardian reported that " some of his trial times were almost unbelievable , " and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury . Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal , as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War . 
 = = = 1932 Olympics and later career = = = 
 Less than three days before the 10 @,@ 000 m , a special commission of the IAAF , consisting of the same seven members that had suspended Nurmi , rejected the Finn 's entries and barred him from competing in Los Angeles . Sigfrid Edström , president of the IAAF and chairman of its executive council , stated that the full congress of the IAAF , which was scheduled to start the next day , could not reinstate Nurmi for the Olympics but merely review the phases and political angles related to the case . The AP called this " one of the slickest political maneuvers in international athletic history " , and wrote that the Games would now be " like Hamlet without the celebrated Dane in the cast . " Thousands protested against the action in Helsinki . Details of the case were not released to the press , but the evidence against Nurmi was believed be the sworn statements from German race promoters that Nurmi had received $ 250 – 500 per race when running in Germany in autumn 1931 . The statements were produced by Karl Ritter von Halt after Edström had sent him increasingly threatening letters , warning that if evidence against Nurmi is not provided , he " will unfortunately have to take stringent action against the German Athletics Association . " 
 On the eve of the marathon , all the entrants of the race except for the Finns , whose positions were known , filed a petition asking Nurmi 's entry to be accepted . Edström 's right @-@ hand man Bo <unk> , secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation , approached the Finnish officials and stated that he might be able to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition . However , Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional , he must have the right to participate in the race officially . Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier , Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes . The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional , but the council 's authority to <unk> an athlete was upheld on a 13 – 12 vote . However , due to the close vote , the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm . Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi 's amateur status , and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden . A year earlier , controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland @-@ Sweden athletics international . After Nurmi 's suspension , Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939 . 
 Nurmi refused to turn professional , and continued running as amateur in Finland . In 1933 , he ran his first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926 . At the IAAF meet in August 1934 , Finland launched two proposals that lost . The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds in violation of the IAAF amateur code . With a 12 – 5 vote , with many not voting , Nurmi 's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite . Less than three weeks later , Nurmi retired from running with a 10 @,@ 000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934 . Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14 @-@ year top @-@ level career . In cross country running , his win streak lasted 19 years . 
 = = Later life = = 
 While active as a runner , Nurmi was known to be secretive about his training methods . Always running alone , he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him . Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him . After ending his career , Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin . In 1935 , Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40 – 38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden . However , Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals , three silvers and a bronze at the Games . In 1936 , Nurmi also opened a men 's clothing store ( haberdashery ) in Helsinki . It became a popular tourist attraction , and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi . The Finn spent his time in the back room , running another new business venture ; construction . As a contractor , Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each . Within five years , he was rated a millionaire . His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi 's flats , at half price . Nurmi also made money on the stock market , eventually becoming one of Finland 's richest people . 
 In February 1940 , during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union , Nurmi returned to the United States with his protégé <unk> <unk> , who had become the first man to run the 10 @,@ 000 m under 30 minutes , to raise funds and rally support to the Finnish cause . The relief drive , directed by former president Herbert Hoover , included a coast @-@ to @-@ coast tour by Nurmi and <unk> . Hoover welcomed the two as " ambassadors of the greatest sporting nation in the world . " While in San Francisco , Nurmi received news that one of his apprentices , 1936 Olympic champion Gunnar <unk> , had been killed in action . Nurmi left for Finland in late April , and later served in the Continuation War in a delivery company and as a trainer in the military staff . Before he was discharged in January 1942 , Nurmi was promoted first to a staff sergeant ( <unk> ) and later to a sergeant first class ( <unk> ) . 
 In 1952 , Nurmi was persuaded by Urho Kekkonen , Prime Minister of Finland and former chairman of the Finnish Athletics Federation , to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . His appearance astonished the spectators , and Sports Illustrated wrote that " his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd . When he came into view , waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium , rising to a roar , then to a thunder . When the national teams , assembled in formation on the infield , saw the flowing figure of Nurmi , they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren , dashing toward the edge of the track . " After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron , Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen , who lighted the beacon in the tower . In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics , Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners . 
 Nurmi felt that he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman , but his interest in running never died . He even returned to the track himself a few times . In 1946 , he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in a benefit for the victims of the Greek Civil War . Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden , invited by the New York Athletic Club . In 1962 , Nurmi predicted that welfare countries would start to struggle in the distance events : " The higher the standard of living in a country , the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble . I would like to warn this new generation : ' Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy . Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise . Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances . ' " In 1966 , he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland , reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists , and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something . Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s , led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka <unk> . He had complimented the running style of Virén , and advised <unk> to concentrate on Kipchoge <unk> . 
 Although he accepted an invitation from President Lyndon B. Johnson to revisit the White House in 1964 , Nurmi lived a very secluded life until the late 1960s when he began granting some press interviews . On his 70th birthday , Nurmi agreed to an interview for Yle , Finland 's national public @-@ broadcasting company , only after learning that President Kekkonen would act as the interviewer . Suffering from health problems , with at least one heart attack , a stroke and failing eyesight , Nurmi at times spoke bitterly about sports , calling it a waste of time compared to science and art . He died in 1973 in Helsinki and was given a state funeral . Kekkonen attended the funeral and praised Nurmi : " People explore the horizons for a successor . But none comes and none will , for his class is extinguished with him . " At the request of Nurmi , who enjoyed classical music and played the violin , <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> ( The <unk> Violin ) was played during the ceremony . Nurmi 's last record fell in 1996 ; his 1925 world record for the indoor 2000 m lasted as the Finnish national record for 71 years . 
 = = Personal life and public image = = 
 Nurmi was married to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen from 1932 to 1935 . Laaksonen , who was not interested in athletics , opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933 , " [ H ] is concentration on athletics at last forced me to go to the judge for a divorce . " Matti Nurmi did become a middle @-@ distance runner , and later a " self @-@ made " businessman . Nurmi 's relationship with his son was termed " uneasy " . Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete , and the two never discussed his running career . As a runner , Matti was at his best in the 3000 m , where he equaled his father 's time . In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the " three <unk> " ( Salsola , Salonen and <unk> ) broke the world record for the 1500 m , Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best , 2 @.@ 2 seconds slower than his father 's world record from 1924 . Hollywood actress <unk> Nurmi , best known as the horror icon " Vampira " , was often referred to as Paavo Nurmi 's niece . However , the kinship is not supported by official documents . 
 Nurmi enjoyed the Finnish sports massage and sauna @-@ bathing traditions , crediting the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924 . He had a versatile diet , although he had practiced vegetarianism between the ages of 15 and 21 . Nurmi , who identified as <unk> , was known to be " taciturn " , " stony @-@ faced " and " stubborn " . He was not believed to have had any close friends , but he had occasionally socialized and showed his " sarcastic sense of humour " among the small circles he knew . Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak , Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media , stating later on his 75th birthday , " [ W ] <unk> fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten <unk> . " French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi 's intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi " is ever more serious , reserved , concentrated , pessimistic , fanatic . There is such coldness in him and his self @-@ control is so great that never for a moment does he show his feelings . " Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him <unk> <unk> ( The Great Silent One ) , and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi 's persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists : " Even to them , he was never quite real . He was enigmatic , sphinx @-@ like , a god in a cloud . It was as if he was all the time playing a role in a drama . " 
 Nurmi was more responsive to his fellow athletes than to the media . He exchanged ideas with sprinter Charley Paddock and even trained with his rival Otto Peltzer . Nurmi told Peltzer to forget his opponents : " Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete . " Nurmi was known to emphasize the importance of psychological strength : " Mind is everything ; muscle , pieces of rubber . All that I am , I am because of my mind . " Regarding Nurmi 's track antics , Peltzer found that " in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track . Stopwatch in hand , lap after lap , he ran towards the tape , subject only to the laws of a mathematical table . " <unk> Johnny Kelley , who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics , said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first , the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name : " He grabbed <unk> of me — he was so excited . I couldn 't believe it ! " 
 Nurmi 's speed and elusive personality led to nicknames such as the " Phantom Finn " , the " King of Runners " and " Peerless Paavo " , while his mathematical prowess and use of a stopwatch led the press to characterize him as a running machine . One newspaperman dubbed Nurmi " a mechanical Frankenstein created to annihilate time . " Phil <unk> noted that " his own innovation — the tactic of pacing himself with a stopwatch — both inspired and troubled people in an era when the robot was becoming symbolic of the modern soulless human being . " Among the popular newspaper rumours about Nurmi was that he had a " freakish heart " with a very low pulse rate . During the debate over his amateur status , Nurmi was joked to have " the lowest heartbeat and the highest asking price of any athlete in the world . "

 Nurmi broke 22 official world records on distances between 1500 m and 20 km ; a record in running . He also set several more unofficial ones for a total of 58 . His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s . Nurmi 's record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964 , swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996 , and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008 . Nurmi 's record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo <unk> won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960 . Time selected Nurmi as the greatest Olympian of all time in 1996 , and IAAF named him among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012 . 
 Nurmi introduced the " even pace " strategy to running , pacing himself with a stopwatch and spreading his energy uniformly over the race . He reasoned that " when you race against time , you don 't have to sprint . Others can 't hold the pace if it is steady and hard all through to the tape . " Archie Macpherson stated that " with the stopwatch always in his hand , he elevated athletics to a new plane of intelligent application of effort and was the harbinger of the modern scientifically prepared athlete . " Nurmi was considered a pioneer also in regards to training ; he developed a systematic all @-@ year @-@ round training program that included both long @-@ distance work and interval running . Peter Lovesey wrote in The Kings of Distance : A Study of Five Great Runners that Nurmi " accelerated the progress of world records ; developed and actually came to personify the analytic approach to running ; and he was a profound influence not only in Finland , but throughout the world of athletics . Nurmi , his style , technique and tactics were held to be infallible , and really seemed so , as successive imitators in Finland steadily improved the records . " <unk> Nelson , founder of Track & Field News , credited Nurmi for popularizing running as a spectator sport : " His imprint on the track world was greater than any man ’ s before or after . He , more than any man , raised track to the glory of a major sport in the eyes of international fans , and they honored him as one of the truly great athletes of all sports . 
 Nurmi 's achievements and training methods inspired future track stars of many generations . Emil Zátopek chanted " I am Nurmi ! I am Nurmi ! " when he trained as a child , and based his training system on what he was able to find out about Nurmi 's methods . Lasse Virén idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet him for the first time on the day that Nurmi died . <unk> El <unk> was inspired to become a runner so that he could " repeat the achievements of the great man of whom his grandfather spoke . " He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games . Nurmi 's influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena . At the 1928 Olympics , Kazimierz Wierzyński won the lyric gold medal with his poem Olympic Laurel that included a verse on Nurmi . In 1936 , Ludwig <unk> and his horse Nurmi won the individual and team gold medals in eventing . 
 A bronze statue of Nurmi was sculpted by <unk> Aaltonen in 1925 . The original is held at the art museum <unk> , but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku , in Jyväskylä , in front of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne , Switzerland . In a widely publicized prank by the students of the Helsinki University of Technology , a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300 @-@ year @-@ old wreck of the Swedish war ship Vasa when it was lifted from the bottom of the sea in 1961 . Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée <unk> in 1926 and by Carl <unk> , whose 1937 work <unk> ( Runners ) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide . <unk> om Nurmi ( The Book about Nurmi ) , released in Sweden in 1925 , was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman . Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939 , while Finnair named its first DC @-@ 8 Paavo Nurmi in 1969 . Nurmi 's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970 . 
 Paavo Nurmi Marathon , held annually since 1969 , is the oldest marathon in Wisconsin and the second @-@ oldest in the American Midwest . In Finland , another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi 's hometown of Turku since 1992 , along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957 . Finlandia University , an American college with Finnish roots , named their athletic center after Nurmi . A ten @-@ mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987 . The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto , composer Jean Sibelius , Enlightenment thinker Anders <unk> and author Elias Lönnrot , respectively . The Nurmi bill was replaced by a new 20 @-@ mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993 . In 1997 , a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the Paavo Nurmi Stadium . Twenty world records have been set at the stadium , including John Landy 's records on the 1500 m and the mile , Nurmi 's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek 's record on the 10 @,@ 000 m . In fiction , Nurmi appears in William Goldman 's 1974 novel Marathon Man as the idol of the protagonist , who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi . The opera on Nurmi , Paavo the Great . Great Race . Great Dream . , written by Paavo <unk> and composed by Tuomas <unk> , debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000 . In a 2005 episode of The Simpsons , Mr. Burns brags that he once <unk> Nurmi in his antique motorcar .

 Anjem Choudary ( Urdu : <unk> <unk> ; born 1967 ) is a British Muslim social and political activist . He was previously a solicitor and served as the chairman of the Society of Muslim Lawyers , and , until it was proscribed , the spokesman for Islam4UK . 
 With Omar Bakri Muhammad , he helped form an Islamist organisation , al @-@ Muhajiroun . The group organised several anti @-@ Western demonstrations , including a banned protest march in London for which Choudary was <unk> to appear in court . The UK government banned Al @-@ Muhajiroun and Choudary was present at the launch of its intended successor , <unk> Sunnah wal <unk> . He later helped form Al Ghurabaa , which was also banned . Choudary then became the spokesman for Islam4UK . He receives little support from mainstream UK Muslims and has been largely criticised in the country 's media . 
 A critic of the UK 's involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , Choudary praised those responsible for the 11 September 2001 and 7 July 2005 attacks . He supports the implementation of Sharia law throughout the UK and marched in protest at the Jyllands @-@ Posten cartoons controversy , following which he was prosecuted for organising an unlawful demonstration . He was investigated , but not charged , for his comments in 2006 regarding Pope Benedict XVI . Choudary is currently on trial for allegedly inviting support of a proscribed organisation , namely the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in the UK on 18 January 1967 , Anjem Choudary is the son of a Welling market trader and is of Pakistani descent . He attended Mulgrave Primary School , in Woolwich . He enrolled as a medical student at the University of Southampton , where he was known as Andy , but failed his first @-@ year exams . Responding to claims that he was a " party animal " who joined his friends in " getting stoned " , in 2014 Choudary commented " I admit that I wasn 't always practising ... I committed many mistakes in my life . " He switched to law and spent his final year as a legal student ( 1990 – 1991 ) at Guildford , before moving to London to teach English as a second language . He found work at a legal firm and completed his legal qualifications to become a lawyer . Choudary became the chairman of the Society of Muslim Lawyers , but was removed from the roll of solicitors ( the official register of legal practitioners ) in 2002 . 
 Choudary first came to public attention in 1999 , when The Sunday Telegraph identified him as having been involved in the recruitment of Muslim trainees leaving Britain to fight abroad . He told the newspaper " before they go abroad to fight for organisations like the IIF , the volunteers are trained in Britain . Some of the training does involve guns and live ammunition . " 
 = = Organisations = = 
 = = = Al @-@ Muhajiroun = = = 
 Choudary embraced Islamism and , with the Islamist militant leader Omar Bakri Muhammed , co @-@ founded al @-@ Muhajiroun a Salafi Wahabi organization . The two men had met at a local mosque , where Bakri was giving a tafsir ( an interpretation of the Qur 'an ) . In 2002 , following a bazaar organised by al @-@ Muhajiroun ( advertised by leaflet and word of mouth ) , Choudary gave a talk on education at Slough . His lecture outlined his ideas for a parallel system of Islamic education in the UK and included elements of the group 's ideology . In the same year , although they were refused a permit by the then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone , on 25 August the group held a rally in London . Choudary was <unk> to Bow Street Magistrates ' Court in January 2003 , on charges which included " exhibiting a notice , advertisement or any other written or pictorial matter " , " using apparatus for the amplification of sound " , " making a public speech or address " and " organising an assembly " . 
 In 2003 or 2004 he organised an Islamic @-@ themed camping trip , at which Bakri lectured , on the 54 @-@ acre ( 220 @,@ 000 m2 ) grounds of the <unk> Islamiyah School in East Sussex . Advertised by word @-@ of @-@ mouth , the trip was attended by 50 Muslim men , most of whom were members of al @-@ Muhajiroun . Bakri later claimed the camp 's activities included lectures on Islam , football and paintballing . In September 2006 , following allegations that it was used in the training and recruitment of terrorists , police searched the school . According to testimony from Al Qaeda suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp , in 1997 and 1998 Abu Hamza and groups of around 30 of his followers held training camps at the school , which included training with <unk> rifles and handguns , and a mock rocket launcher . No arrests were made , and students and faculty were allowed to return on 23 September 2006 , the first day of Ramadan . 
 The UK government had investigated expelling Bakri even before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 , and in July 2003 the headquarters of al @-@ Muhajiroun , and the homes of Bakri and Choudary , were raided by the police . The following year , under new anti @-@ terrorist legislation , the government announced that it wanted to ban al @-@ Muhajiroun . In 2005 Bakri learned that he was at risk of prosecution for his support of the 7 July 2005 London bombers , and in August left the UK for Lebanon , where he claimed that he was on holiday . After leaving a television station where he said " I will not return to Britain unless I want to go there as a visitor or as a tourist " , he was detained by Lebanon 's general security department and held in a Beirut prison . Several days later , Bakri was excluded from returning to Britain by the Home Secretary , Charles Clarke , on the grounds that his presence in Britain was " not conducive to the public good . " Choudary condemned the decision and demanded to know what Bakri had done to justify the ban . He claimed that ministers were inventing rules to ensure that Bakri could not return . In November Choudary and three other followers of Bakri were deported from Lebanon , and returned to the UK . Choudary blamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for orchestrating their deportations , claiming that the four were there to help Bakri set up a madrasah . 
 Following his deportation , Choudary attended the launch in London of <unk> Sunnah wal <unk> , the intended successor organisation to al @-@ Muhajiroun . Choudary said that Bakri was not on the committee of the new group , but that " we would love for the sheikh to have a role . " The organisation operates mainly through an invitation @-@ only internet forum , to which Choudary contributes under the screen name Abou <unk> . A reporter visiting the site found calls for holy war , and recordings by Osama Bin Laden , Ayman al @-@ Zawahiri , and Omar Bakri Mohammed . 
 Al @-@ Muhajiroun attempted a relaunch in June 2009 at Conway Hall , in Holborn . Several speakers were invited to share a platform with Choudary , but some later claimed that they had been invited under false pretences . When the group refused to allow women into the meeting , the chairman of the society which runs the hall cancelled the event . He was heckled by many of those in the audience . Choudary took the microphone from the chairman and led chants of " sharia for UK " , saying in reference to the exclusion of women : " Jews and Christians will never make peace with you until you either become like them or adopt their ways . " Outside the hall , Choudary criticised British society , and predicted that Muslims would make up the majority within one or two decades . When asked why , if society was so bad , he lived here , he replied : " We come here to civilise people , get them to come out of the darkness and injustice into the beauty of Islam . " 
 = = = Al Ghurabaa = = = 
 Choudary was also a spokesman for Al Ghurabaa , believed to have been an offshoot of al @-@ Muhajiroun . It was proscribed in 2006 by the then Home Secretary John Reid . Choudary was outraged : " The easy option when one is losing an argument is to ban the opposition voice . ... We [ al @-@ Ghurabaa ] are not a military organisation ; we have only been vociferous in our views — views concerning everything from the government 's foreign policy in Iraq and Afghanistan to the host of draconian laws , which they ’ ve introduced against us in this country . " 
 = = = Islam4UK = = = 
 In November 2008 , Choudary organised a meeting of the then recently formed Islam4UK , which , according to its website , was " established by sincere Muslims as a platform to propagate the supreme Islamic ideology within the United Kingdom as a divine alternative to man @-@ made law " , and to " convince the British public about the superiority of Islam ... thereby changing public opinion in favour of Islam in order to transfer the authority and power ... to the Muslims in order to implement the <unk> ’ ah ( here in Britain ) " . According to Ed Husain , co @-@ founder of the counter @-@ terrorism think @-@ tank the Quilliam Foundation , Islam4UK was a " splinter group of al @-@ Muhajiroun and Hizb ut @-@ Tahrir , the originators of extremism in Britain . " The meeting , advertised as a conference to " rise to defend the honour of the Muslims " , was held at the Brady Arts and Community Centre in Tower Hamlets . Choudary then announced that Bakri would be speaking , via a video @-@ conference link , although technical problems meant that his address was instead given over a telephone line . When asked by a Muslim woman how the comments of one of the event 's speakers could be justified , with regards to Islam being a religion of peace , Choudary stated , " Islam is not a religion of peace ... It is a religion of submission . We need to submit to the will of Allah . " 
 With the announcement by Islam4UK that it planned to hold a protest march through Wootton Bassett ( known for the military funeral repatriations of dead British soldiers returning from the war in Afghanistan ) , Choudary said " You may see one or two coffins being returned to the UK every other day , but when you think about the people of Afghanistan its a huge number [ being killed ] in comparison [ ... ] I intend to write a letter to the parents of British soldiers telling them the reality of what they died for . " Choudary 's open letter was published on 3 January 2010 . It explained his reasons for proposing the march , endorsed his religious beliefs , and claimed that UK politicians had been lying about the war . Choudary wrote that the proposed march was to " engage the British public 's minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in body bags and the real cost of the war . " In an interview with Sky News , he stated that the location was chosen to effect a level of media attention which " it would not have gained anywhere else " . The proposal was condemned by the British Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , who said that to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be " completely inappropriate " . The Minhaj @-@ ul @-@ Quran International UK centre in Forest Gate also condemned the proposal , as did the Muslim Council of Britain , which stated that it " condemns the call by the fringe extremist group Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett . " The planned march was cancelled by the group , on 10 January 2010 . 
 From 14 January 2010 , Islam4UK was proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 , making membership illegal and punishable by imprisonment . Choudary condemned the order . In an interview on BBC Radio he said " we are now being targeted as an extremist or terrorist organisation and even banned for merely expressing that " and " I feel this is a failure of the concept of democracy and freedom . " Following his arrest and subsequent release in September 2014 on suspicion of encouraging terrorism , Choudary claimed he was questioned about his membership of or support for proscribed groups including Islam4UK and <unk> , both of which the government believes are successors to al @-@ Muhajiroun . 
 = = Views = = 
 Choudary referred to the 11 September 2001 terrorists as " magnificent martyrs " . In 2003 he said that al @-@ Muhajiroun would " encourage people to fulfil their Islamic duties and responsibilities " , although he also said that the group was a political movement and not responsible for individual actions . In 2004 he said that a terror attack on British soil was " a matter of time " . He refused to condemn the 7 July 2005 London bombings , but accused the Muslim Council of Britain ( who had ) of " selling their souls to the devil " . He blamed the 2013 murder of Lee Rigby , an off @-@ duty British soldier , on British foreign policy . 
 Choudary has voiced support for the Muslim community in Somalia , who , he claims , have been " violated " by Christian @-@ backed Ethiopians , and has also called for other members to fight jihad . 
 The Wall Street Journal describes Choudary as a supporter of " the fundamentalist strain of Islamic teaching known as <unk> " . He believes in the primacy of Islam over all other faiths , and the implementation of Sharia Law , in its entirety , in the UK . In 2001 he stated that his allegiance is to Islam , and not a country . He believes that , for a true Muslim , " a British passport is no more than a travel document . " In October 2006 he addressed an audience at Trinity College , Dublin to oppose the motion that " This house believes that Islamist violence can never be justified " . In February 2008 the Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , commented that " as a matter of fact certain provisions of sharia are already recognised in our society and under our law " . Choudary responded by saying that Sharia " has to be adopted wholesale " , and that " it will come either by embracing Islam because it is the fastest growing religion in the country , or by an Islamic country conquering Britain or by elements embracing Islam and imposing it . " 
 In 2008 he spoke of the " flag of Sharia " flying over Downing Street by 2020 , claimed that some Muslim families in east London were having " 10 or 12 children each " , and that hundreds were converting to Islam each day . Choudary has spoken against elements of the Christian faith . In December 2008 he posted a sermon on an Islamic website , in which he stated : " Every Muslim has a responsibility to protect his family from the misguidance of Christmas , because its observance will lead to hellfire . Protect your Paradise from being taken away – protect yourself and your family from Christmas " . 
 In an interview with Iran 's Press TV ( which was subsequently posted online on 11 April 2013 ) , Choudary stated " As Muslims , we reject democracy , we reject secularism , and freedom , and human rights . We reject all of the things that you espouse as being ideals ... There is nothing called a republic in Islam . When we talk about the <unk> 'a , we are talking about only the <unk> 'a . We are talking about rejecting the U.N. , the IMF , and the World Bank . " 
 In 2013 the British pressure group Hope not Hate presented a report which identified Choudary as " a serious player on the international Islamist scene " , saying that although there was no evidence that he was directly responsible for instigating any terrorist plots , " he helped shape the mindset of many of those behind them " and " through his networks linked them up to terror groups and supporters across the world . " Choudary dismissed the claims as " fanciful " , that if they were true , UK security services would have arrested him . 
 In September 2014 , Choudary described Abu Bakr al @-@ Baghdadi , leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , as " the caliph of all Muslims and the prince of the believers " . 
 On 5 August 2015 , Choudary was charged with one offence under section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for inviting support of a proscribed organisation , namely Islamic State , between June 2014 and March 2015 . An expected trial date until 7 March 2016 has been given . His trial was postponed to 27 June 2016 , and is expected to last no more than four weeks .

 Choudary has regularly attended public marches and , following a protest march outside the Danish Embassy in London on 3 February 2006 , held in response to the Jyllands @-@ Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy , he was a member of a panel of interviewees on the BBC news programme Newsnight . He defended Muslims in Britain , saying that " we live in peace with the host community , we are not allowed to target people here " , and claimed that the police had inspected and allowed the controversial placards used in the demonstration . Choudary was criticised by his fellow panellists , who included Ann Cryer , then MP for Keighley , <unk> Khan , of the al @-@ Nisa Muslim Women 's Group ( who accused him of demonising Islam ) , Sayeeda Warsi , the vice @-@ chair of the Conservative Party , Professor Tariq Ramadan ( who claimed that Choudary 's actions were designed to evoke a strong response from the media ) , and Roger <unk> , the leader of the UK Independence Party . On 15 March 2006 he was among five men arrested in connection with the demonstration , which had been organised by al Ghurabaa . He was arrested again on 4 May at Stansted Airport for an alleged breach of bail , and charged with organising the protest without notifying police . He was bailed to appear before Bow Street Magistrates Court on 11 May . On 4 July 2006 he was convicted and fined £ 500 with £ 300 court costs . 
 The following day , at an Al Ghurabaa press conference at the Al Badr centre in Leyton , Choudary claimed that the blame for the London bombings lay with the British government , and said that the then Prime Minister , Tony Blair , had " blood on his hands " . He also urged Muslims to defend themselves against perceived attacks by " whatever means they have at their disposal " , and referred to the 2 June 2006 Forest Gate raid in which Mohammed Abdul <unk> was shot in the shoulder . He encouraged Muslims not to co @-@ operate with the police under any circumstances . Local council leader Clyde <unk> criticised Choudary 's comments , stating " I am sure the vast majority of Waltham Forest residents do not support these views . " Several days later , on 9 June 2006 , Choudary organised a demonstration outside the Forest Gate police station in London , to protest against the arrest of the two Forest Gate men . The men 's families said that an extremist protest would " only give another opportunity for our community to be portrayed in a negative light " and sent a statement to more than twenty mosques ( read to worshippers during prayers ) urging them to disassociate themselves from the event . About 35 men and 15 women attended the demonstration . 
 In September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI gave a speech on the question of the " reasonableness " of the Christian faith , to the University of Regensburg in Germany . In the Regensburg lecture he spoke about rationality in faith , and cited comments by the fourteenth @-@ century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos , who , as the Pope put it , said " show me just what Mohamed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached . " The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world , including the parliament of Pakistan which condemned the Pope for his comments , and which sought an apology from him . Following the speech , on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral , where he told reporters " Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment . " The Daily Mail reported him as saying : " I am here [ to ] have a peaceful demonstration , but there may be people in Italy and other parts that would carry that out . " The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments , but concluded that " no substantive offences " were committed during the demonstration . The Shadow Home Secretary , David Davis , who had called for action to be taken against Choudary , said : " It is quite disgraceful . It sends out a message to Muslim extremists that we , as a country , do not have the moral courage to stand up to them . " 
 He attempted to enter France to demonstrate against the French government 's decision to ban the burka , but was stopped at the port of Calais . His passport was seized and he was issued documents banning him from France indefinitely . 
 On 13 December 2013 Choudary led a march in Brick Lane , organised by the east London @-@ based Sharia Project , demanding a ban on alcohol being sold by Muslim establishments . An East London Mosque official , speaking of the patrols , identified The Shariah Project as " strongly linked " to Anjem Choudary 's banned group Al @-@ Muhajiroun . Abu <unk> of The Shariah Project had predicted " hundreds " would join the demonstration , claiming that groups of Muslims would come from as far away as the Midlands to take part . In the event , only a few dozen protesters took part in the march . Choudary afterwards explained its purpose : “ What we did is we posted a notice to the shop owners saying that under Sharia and under the Koran the sale of alcohol is prohibited and if one were to also drink alcohol , that would be 40 lashes . We were there to teach them that just because they are living among non @-@ Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain , and so they should be aware that just because it is not Sharia today , they can ’ t just do whatever they like . ” Choudary said that the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies .

 Choudary has been largely criticised by most UK newspapers , some of whom describe him as an extremist , or radical cleric or preacher . In January 2010 , Guardian contributor Mehdi Hasan wrote : " Is Choudary an Islamic scholar whose views merit attention or consideration ? No . Has he studied under leading Islamic scholars ? Nope . Does he have any Islamic qualifications or credentials ? None whatsoever . So what gives him the right to pontificate on Islam , British Muslims or ' the hellfire ' ? Or proclaim himself a ' sharia judge ' ? " , and claimed that Choudary was " as unrepresentative of British Muslim opinion , as he is of British anti @-@ war opinion . " 
 The Conservative Party leader David Cameron said that Choudary " is one of those people who needs to be looked at seriously in terms of the legality of what he 's saying because he strays , I think , extremely close to the line of encouraging hatred , extremism and violence . " 
 Salma <unk> , then leader of the Respect Party , said in 2010 of Choudary : " He is a bigot whose goal in life is to provoke division . He engages in these provocations because he is deeply hostile to any coming together of Muslims and non @-@ Muslims . For him , the fact that a majority of the British people – Muslim and non @-@ Muslim – oppose the war in Afghanistan is not something to be celebrated , but is something to be feared . " Rod Liddle , writing in The Spectator , said : " Anjem <unk> ... is one of those thick @-@ as @-@ mince gobby little <unk> who could only possibly come from Britain . " Conservatives in the United States have also been critical of Choudary . Fox News host Sean Hannity called Choudary " one sick , miserable , evil S.O.B. " during a segment on his show discussing the 2011 Egyptian protests . 
 Choudary has received little support from the mainstream Muslim community . However , in January 2010 Jamie Bartlett , a writer for the Telegraph , speculated that he might have " some " support among the minority of Muslims in the UK who could be considered to hold conservative views . The following year , Peter Oborne , defending Baroness Warsi 's criticism of how British Muslims have been treated , singled out Choudary as an exception to the majority that were " decent people " . 
 Tabloid criticism of Islam4UK and Choudary since news of the proposed march first became public has , generally , been vitriolic , calling him a " hate preacher " . In January 2010 , appearing on the BBC 's The Daily Politics , he was asked by its presenter , Andrew Neil , for his opinions on the banning of Islam4UK , before being asked to comment on his financial status , claiming that it was " relevant to our viewers " . Choudary told Neil that his finances were a personal matter , and that he was " doing something , and I don 't want to discuss that with you . I 'm not on Jobseeker 's allowance , but at the same time I have family allowance , I have very firmly held views which I 'm propagating at the same time . " Responding to the media 's criticism of him , Choudary said " I do believe that people have been whipped up into an anti @-@ Islam anti @-@ Muslim frenzy . "

 In 1996 , Choudary married <unk> Akhtar , or <unk> , who was then 22 years old and had recently joined al @-@ Muhajiroun , which he led at the time . She later became the group 's head of women . The couple have four children . 
 = Thorne and Hatfield Moors = 
 Thorne and Hatfield Moors form the largest area of lowland raised peat bog in the United Kingdom . They are situated in South Yorkshire , to the north @-@ east and east of Doncaster near the town of Thorne , and are part of Hatfield Chase . They had been used for small @-@ scale extraction of peat for fuel from medieval times , and probably much earlier , but commercial extraction of the peat for animal bedding began in the 1880s . The peat was cut on the moors and , once it had dried , transported to several works on 3 ft ( 914 mm ) narrow gauge tramways , always called trams locally . The wagons were pulled by horses to works at Creyke 's Siding , Moorends , Medge Hall , Swinefleet and Hatfield . There was also a network of canals supplying the Moorends Works . 
 The industry suffered a downturn between the two world wars , as working horses were replaced by lorries and peat demand dropped , but after the Second World War peat was used by the horticultural industry in increasing volumes , and harvesting expanded again . From 1947 , experiments were made with locomotives on the tramways , and they soon replaced horses . A total of 23 had worked on the system by the time it was closed down . The extraction process was mechanised in the 1960s , with the introduction of machines that could cut and stack the peat turves . In 1981 mechanical loading of the turves into the trains was introduced . Surface milling of the peat was introduced in 1985 , which completely stripped the surface of large areas of the moors . 
 Some environmental bodies considered the moors to be worthless , but tireless campaigning by William Bunting after the Second World War , culminating in direct action by a group known as Bunting 's Beavers in 1972 , resulted in a change of policy . The nature of the moor habitat has gradually been recognised as an ecological resource . From 1971 the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust has managed a small area of Crowle Moor for conservation , and the Nature Conservancy Council bought another small area in 1985 . A major change occurred in 1994 , when Fisons company gave English Nature 2 @,@ 340 acres ( 946 ha ) of moorland , although they retained the right to continue extracting peat on some of it . By 2002 , Scotts owned the cutting rights but most cutting of peat effectively ended in 2001 , since the government buy @-@ out in 2002 of the extraction rights from Scotts occurred before the cutting season had begun . Removal of peat stockpiled on the moors continued into 2006 . Since then the moors have been managed as a National Nature Reserve by Natural England . Scotts still have a works at Hatfield , which processes imported peat . 
 = = Location = = 
 Thorne Moors and Hatfield Moors together cover an area of some 8 @,@ 201 acres ( 3 @,@ 319 ha ) , and are a small remnant of a much larger wetland system that once covered around 770 square miles ( 2 @,@ 000 km2 ) known as the Humberhead Levels . The moors lie to the east of the town of Thorne and the M18 motorway . Thorne Moors are situated to the north of the <unk> motorway , while Hatfield Moors lie to the south of that road . Although much reduced in size , they are still the largest area of lowland raised peat bog in the United Kingdom . 
 Thorne Moors are also called Swinefleet Moors , and both terms describe Crowle Moor , Goole Moor , Rawcliffe Moor , Snaith and Cowick Moor , and Thorne Waste collectively . 
 = = History = = 
 The moors had been used as a source for domestic fuel , in the form of peat , since at least the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , and probably as early as the Roman or pre @-@ Roman periods . In the early 1800s , peat was still being formed : William Harrison reported that a short time after moving to Thorne , a rise in the surface of the moors has obscured Crowle Church , previously visible from his home . 
 The area saw major changes in its hydrology in the 1630s , as a result of the drainage works of Cornelius Vermuyden . The River Don was routed northwards from Stainforth , passing to the west of the moors ; the River Idle routed along the southern edge of Hatfield Chase , and a new channel was cut for the River <unk> , which was isolated from the surrounding land by new flood banks . These works had less effect on Thorne Moors , which became isolated from Hatfield Moors with the completion of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1802 , running in an east @-@ west direction between them . The moors were " warped " during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , a process by which silt @-@ laden floodwater from the River Trent and the River Ouse was allowed to cover the land , resulting in silt building up on the surface . The Swinefleet Warping Drain can still be seen , running along the eastern edge of the moors , and connecting to the Ouse below Goole . It was last used for this purpose just before the First World War , in connection with land reclamation near Medge Hall , Crowle . This was the last known occasion on which warping was used in the moors to the south of the Humber . 
 The Thorne Moors Improvement Company was set up in 1848 , authorised by the Thorne Moor Drainage and Improvement Act . They were charged with improving parts of the bog . Their activities increased in the 1880s , when they began to lease areas to companies who extracted the peat commercially for use as animal bedding . In order to do this , ditches had to be cut to begin the process of drainage . As the extent of the workings increased , a Dutch company cut canals in the peat . Horses pulled barges from canal paths alongside in order to remove the peat from the moors . Subsequently , a network of small railways were constructed along the canals to transport the peat . 
 Until the mid @-@ twentieth century , all peat was cut by hand . Although the effects of the industry on the ecology of the moors were serious , hand cutting mainly affected the surface of the moors . It left behind trenches and ditches , which soon became waterlogged , and were re @-@ colonised to become part of the diverse habitat . Once the cutting process was mechanised , peat could be cut from a greater depth , and at a faster rate , resulting in less ability for the moors to recover . Mechanical peat cutting was introduced to the moors in the early 1960s , and the process was similar to hand cutting , in that the peat was extracted over a small area but to a considerable depth . More destructive to the ultimate regeneration of the moors was the introduction of peat milling in 1985 , where a thin layer of peat was stripped from a wider area . Thus in 1910 , around 56 tonnes per acre were extracted from 1 @,@ 240 acres ( 500 ha ) of the moors , whereas in 1985 the yield was 10 tonnes per acre over double that area . As early as the late 1960s , academics and conservation agencies expressed concerns that the moors had been so badly damaged by peat extraction and farming that they were not worth saving . 
 = = = Environmental campaigning = = = 
 A scheme to cover the moors with ash from coal @-@ fired power stations , and possibly municipal rubbish , was proposed in 1962 , and again in 1969 . Another plan of the 1960s was to build a regional airport on the moors ; this proposal was revived in 1971 . Further ash @-@ tipping schemes were voiced in 1974 , as was a third plan for an airport in 1976 . There were also plans to use the moor as a dump for colliery waste in 1978 , when Thorne Colliery was upgraded and reopened . 
 = = = = William Bunting = = = = 
 Although official attitudes did not place much value on the moors , William Bunting moved to Thorne after the Second World War and became an advocate for moor preservation . Thought to be rude and irascible , he began a campaign to recognise the ecological importance of the moors . He asserted that the enclosures of the 1800s , when common rights were replaced by private ownership , had been illegal , as was much of the commercial exploitation of his time . He seemed to have a good deal of evidence to support his claims , and took several major utilities to court over acts which he felt were illegal . He won a series of high @-@ profile cases , which he used as publicity to advance the case for conserving the moors . In 1972 , Bunting began direct action , aided by local residents , local naturalists , and students . During the week , the peat extraction company Fisons would cut drains to begin the process of lowering the water table . During the weekends , Bunting 's Beavers , as his team became known , would walk onto the moors and construct dams across the new ditches , to retain the water levels . By the summer , the Beavers appeared to be winning the battle , and their activities were featured on BBC television . Fisons dynamited eighteen of the dams , but the activists were undeterred and began rebuilding them . Finally , Fisons conceded defeat , and negotiated with the Nature Conservancy Council on the future management of the moors in 1974 . The government granted some 4 @,@ 560 acres ( 1 @,@ 845 ha ) Site of Special Scientific Interest status in 1981 . Although this had little immediate effect , it has contributed to subsequent appreciation of the area and its importance as an ecological resource . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 The first small step towards conservation of the moors occurred in 1971 , when an agreement was reached between the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust and Fisons on the management of 144 acres ( 58 ha ) on Crowle Moor . In 1985 , the Nature Conservancy Council bought 180 acres ( 73 ha ) of Thorne Waste , which had been part of the area worked by a canal network . The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust purchased a total of 290 acres ( 118 ha ) in 1987 , which included the area they had been managing since 1971 . The first large @-@ scale transfer of land occurred in 1994 , when Fisons gave 2 @,@ 340 acres ( 946 ha ) to English Nature , the successor to the Nature Conservancy Council . The agreement allowed Fisons to lease back the active peat fields from English Nature , and to continue to extract peat until 2025 . However , they agreed to leave a minimum of 20 inches ( 50 cm ) of peat , so that the moors could recover once extraction ceased . Areas that were not being worked were managed for conservation . At this time , English Nature also took control of parts of Hatfield Moors . The areas they managed were designated as the Humberhead <unk> National Nature Reserve in 1995 , and were extended by another 370 acres ( 150 ha ) in the following year . 
 Most extraction of peat from the moors had ended by 2004 , after the peat extraction rights , then owned by Scotts , had been bought by the government for £ 17 million . A small @-@ scale operation was still active in 2005 . 
 Environmentalists continued to campaign for recognition of the ecological value of the moors . In 2002 the government agreed to buy the peat extraction rights from The Scotts Company ( now trading as The Scotts Miracle @-@ Gro Company ) . The agreement was signed in April , before the cutting season began , and no cutting occurred on Thorne Moors after 2001 . <unk> of cut peat continued to be removed from the moors until 2005 . Scotts worked with English Nature to return worked areas to a condition where they could start to regenerate , until their involvement with this contract on Thorne Moors ended in March 2006 . Since 2005 , 4 @,@ 020 acres ( 1 @,@ 625 ha ) of Thorne Moors have been designated as a National Nature Reserve . This includes the area bought by the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust , which now manage most of Crowle Moor on behalf of Natural England , the successor to English Nature . 
 Limbert and Roworth have commented that , unlike other peat areas , such as the Somerset Levels , where recording of the industrial heritage has been systematic , the recording of the industrial archaeology of Thorne and Hatfield Moors has been notably scarce . A guide to the industrial history of South Yorkshire published in 1995 made no mention of peat at all . The canals dug by the Dutch and operated until the 1920s have been mentioned by canal historians such as Charles Hadfield , but have never been investigated systematically . The railways have received a little more attention in the specialist press , and some of the locomotives have been preserved . The history of the workers has been partially recorded through the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Oral History Project . In contrast , the ecology of the moors has been better documented , through the publication of the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Papers , first published by the Doncaster Naturalists Society in 1987 . Since 1989 , the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Conservation Forum have taken over this responsibility . These papers now run to eight volumes , and the forum has also published technical papers on many aspects of the moors . 
 = = Peat industry = = 
 By the mid @-@ eighteenth century , there was a small but established peat industry on the moors . George Stovin recorded that labourers dug peat turves in the summer , which were dressed by their wives and children , before being exported by boat through Thorne sluice and the River Don . The product was transported to Gainsborough , Leeds , Lincoln and York . The boats used were double @-@ ended , about 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) long , and traveled by canals dug into the peat , the chief of which was called Boating Dyke . Up to forty boats were operating in the 1790s , but competition from coal , which was a more efficient fuel , resulted in a decline , and only eight or nine boats were still operating in the 1820s . Internal canals on the moors had ceased to be used by the 1830s , with turves being transported by cart to Thorne or to the Stainforth and Keadby Canal . 
 There followed a period when improvement of the moors for agriculture was considered the way to proceed . An entrepreneur named John Gossip bought 3 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 ha ) of moor near Lindholme , and set about warping it with silt from an old river bed near Lindholme Lake . The cost proved excessive , and he installed a stationary steam engine and narrow gauge railway tracks , on which small wagons were pushed by hand , to aid the work . He ran into financial difficulties , however , and the land was repossessed by his backers . The main emphasis of the Thorne Moor Improvement Company , set up in 1848 , was the " draining , warping and otherwise improving " of Thorne Waste , but the railway across the moors proposed by the Great Northern Railway Company , which was to provide transport for the products of the improved land , did not materialise , and little was achieved . 
 Two drains were built , of which the most successful was the Swinefleet Warping Drain , pioneered by Ralph Creyke and <unk> <unk> , and authorised by an Act of Parliament . Opened in 1821 , poor @-@ quality land was reclaimed for around forty years . The other scheme was Durham 's Warping Drain , to the north of Thorne , which ran westwards to a sluice on the River Don . The drain was completed in 1856 by Makin Durham , but he failed to achieve much reclamation of the peat moors . He died in 1882 , just as ideas to use the peat commercially began to replace the concept of attempting to make the moors suitable for agriculture . The change was brought about by an agricultural depression and the high price of straw for animal bedding . 
 Peat was more absorbent than straw , and as there were huge numbers of working horses at the time , it was promoted as a replacement for straw . It could also be used for packing of fruit , as a replacement for sandbags , for fertiliser and as potting compost , as well as the manufacture of paraffin , creosote and tar . The owners of Thorne and Hatfield Moors leased their lands to peat companies , whose workers would dig drains , cut the turves , and stack them up to allow them to dry , so that they were ready for sale . The product was in competition with imports from the Netherlands , and the Dutch Griendtsveen Company set up the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Company in 1893 , a holding company which would buy up companies operating in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom . The works at Moorends kept its ledgers in Dutch and English , and a number of Dutch workers relocated to Thorne . By 1899 , there were some 120 Dutch workers , forming a community of 300 with their wives and children , and there was concern among local people that they would lose their own jobs . Dutch tools and working practices were introduced , and the immigrants cut around 14 miles ( 23 km ) of canals to transport peat to the mill at Moorends . The iron barges used on the canals were 40 feet ( 12 m ) long , and were double ended , as they could not be turned round . A total of twelve were built in the Netherlands , and remained in use until 1922 , when Moorends Mill burnt down . The barges were cut up , and the mill was not rebuilt , although some of the other buildings were used as <unk> until 1956 . 
 = = = Amalgamation = = = 
 In 1896 , the British Moss Litter Company was formed , from an amalgamation of the Hatfield Chase Peat Moss Litter Company , the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Company , and most of the other companies working on the moors . They gained control of works at Creyke 's Siding and Moorends to the west , Medge Hall to the south , Swinefleet to the east , and Old Goole in the north , together with the mill on Hatfield Moors . Old Goole mill closed in 1902 , although peat was stored there for another twelve years . The new company did not have complete control of the moors , as there were several small independent peat works on Crowle Moor . The company was restructured in 1899 , by winding up the original company and creating a new one with the same name but additional working capital . At the same time , Swinefleet Works was formally purchased , whereas it had been leased by the old company . Sales of peat rose steadily from 39 @,@ 444 tons in 1893 to 74 @,@ 948 tons in 1898 . 
 Following the end of the First World War , sales of peat began to decline , as working horses were replaced by motor lorries and tractors . The British Moss Litter Company bought up two other companies who were extracting peat in Crowle Moor in 1935 . Most peat was sold as bales , with ' fine ' peat being used by gardeners and the growing of mushrooms and ' litter ' being used for animal bedding , while ' tailings ' were used for floor covering at show @-@ jumping events and for bulking up feed for cows . Around one @-@ fifth was not baled , and was used for various purposes , including the production of <unk> , for health cures at Harrogate baths , and the purifying of gas by gas companies , for which it was mixed with iron ore at Creyke 's Siding . By the late 1940s , it was finding a new market as litter for battery hen houses , and by then around 90 per cent was baled . 
 The works at Creyke 's Siding was closed in the early 1960s , after fire destroyed much of it , Swinefleet Works was damaged by fire in 1962 , and a fire on the moors at Hatfield destroyed huge stocks of dried peat . Despite this , the agricultural supplies company Fisons bought the operation in February 1963 , and began upgrading the works at Swinefleet and Hatfield . Medge Hall works was in need of new machinery , and did not have good access for lorries , and so was closed in 1966 . By the time a management buyout occurred in July 1994 , Fisons was making £ 3 @.@ 8 million profit annually on a turnover of £ 47 million . The new owners traded as Levington Horticulture , but on 1 January 1998 , were taken over by the American garden products company Scotts . 
 = = = Transport = = = 
 Creyke 's Siding and Moorends Works were both located close to the main railway line from Doncaster to Goole ( Hull and Doncaster Branch ) , and were served by sidings . Medge Hall Works was similarly close to the line from Doncaster to Grimsby , and was also served by a siding . Swinefleet Works had their own 3 ft 7 in ( 1 @,@ 093 mm ) gauge tramway , which ran northwards to a wharf on the River Ouse near Swinefleet Clough . The line was around 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) long , and had a single steam engine , built by Webster , Jackson & Co. of Goole . The Goole and Marshland Light Railway and the Isle of Axholme Light Railway were authorised by Light Railway Orders in 1898 and 1899 , and became the Axholme Joint Railway after a takeover by two larger companies in 1901 . Following discussions , to try to alleviate a level crossing of the tramway and the new railway , a siding was constructed to Swinefleet Works , and the tramway was lifted in 1903 . The railway company also built a 5 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) branch from Epworth in 1909 , in the hope of gaining the peat traffic from Hatfield Works , but they continued to cart their output north to Maud 's Bridge , on the Doncaster to Scunthorpe line . The railway built a loading dock in 1911 , and still did not gain the traffic , but finally in 1913 , agreed to build a siding into the works in exchange for all the peat traffic . Thus all of the British Moss Litter Company 's works could export their produce by rail . 
 A system of horse @-@ drawn tramways was used to move the peat across the moor from at least the 1890s , since the lines are marked on the 1890 Ordnance Survey maps , and Booth includes a picture of Moorends Works taken in the 1890s , showing both 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) wagons and the 3 ft ( 914 mm ) gauge wooden peat wagons used internally . Rotherham includes an engraving of a peat wagon in his book , consisting of a farm cart , still with its road wheels attached , but with a four @-@ wheeled bogie under each of the axles to allow it to be pulled along the rails by two horses . However , no indication of a date is given . The rails were quite light , at 9 or 12 pounds per yard ( 4 @.@ 5 or 6 @.@ 0 kg / m ) , but were gradually increased to 18 pounds per yard ( 8 @.@ 9 kg / m ) , and by the 1980s , when locomotives were in use , rails of 30 pounds per yard ( 15 kg / m ) were installed . The flat @-@ bottomed rails were initially made of iron , but were later replaced by steel rails . The tracks were referred to locally as trams , rather than tramways . 
 = = = Locomotives = = = 
 The first use of powered vehicles on the tramways occurred in 1947 , when one of the fitters at Moorends Works built a machine from a wooden wagon frame and parts from an Austin Swallow car . Although trials were carried out in which peat wagons were towed , it was mainly used to transport personnel around the moors . It had an 8 @-@ horsepower ( 6 @.@ 0 kW ) engine , was later based at Swinefleet Works , and was derelict by 1960 . The first purpose @-@ built locomotive was also based at Swinefleet , and was bought in 1955 . It was probably built by James & Frederick Howard of Bedford , and was a four @-@ wheeled machine , fitted with a petrol engine , which was replaced by a Dorman diesel engine within a year as petrol was rationed at the time , due to the Suez Canal crisis . It was sufficiently successful that two horses were retired , and the company soon realised that the cost of owning locomotives was much less than the cost of owning horses , since they did not need to be fed and watered when not actually working . 
 The company ordered two new locomotives from the Lincoln @-@ based firm of Ruston and Hornsby in 1959 . They were described as class <unk> locomotives by the manufacturer , and were fitted with 31 @.@ 5 hp ( 23 @.@ 5 kW ) two @-@ cylinder engines . One went to Swinefleet , after which the Howard machine was scrapped , and the other went to Medge Hall . A third locomotive of the same type was then ordered for Hatfield Works , allowing the horses there to be retired . The Medge Hall engine was transferred to Swinefleet when the works closed in 1966 . 
 The next acquisition of locomotives took place after the British Moss Peat Company was acquired by Fisons in 1963 . They ordered three 8 @.@ 5 hp ( 6 @.@ 3 kW ) machines from R A Lister and Company , who were based in Dursley , Gloucestershire . They consisted of little more than an engine and driver 's seat mounted on a chassis , and were used on the moors where the peat was loaded into wagons , only returning to the works for maintenance . Two were delivered to Swinefleet in 1964 , and one went to Hatfield . A second machine for the Hatfield operation was ordered in 1967 . Wooden peat trucks were gradually phased out following the purchase of 100 steel wagons in 1963 and 1964 . They were manufactured in Leeds by Robert Hudson ( <unk> ) Ltd , and were subsequently fitted with a fine inner mesh , to enable them to carry fragmented peat rather than turves . The new wagons had a side @-@ opening door , and a tippler was installed to allow them to be emptied automatically . 
 = = = Mechanisation = = = 
 On the moors , when dried turves were ready to be collected , temporary track sections were laid at right angles to the main line , and a portable turntable was installed . A rake of twelve wagons could then be moved onto the temporary track , one at a time , to be filled by a ' filling gang ' . Each wagon held about a ton , and once all twelve had been manoeuvred over the turntable back onto the main line , they would be pulled to the works by horses . With the advent of the small Lister engines , a new system was used , where three curved sections of track were used , the end one being clipped onto the top of the main line track . The engines could then push a line of forty or fifty wagons onto the temporary track . Cutting of the peat was mechanised from 1963 , with the introduction of German peat @-@ cutting machines , and by 1970 , all hand cutting had ceased . Loading of the turves into wagons was also initially by hand , but gradually ' sod collectors ' were introduced , which at Swinefleet had a 25 @-@ yard ( 23 m ) conveyor and at Hatfield a 44 @-@ yard ( 40 m ) one . These enabled a single side track to serve a much wider section of moor , without having to move the track . Loading turves onto the start of the conveyor was still done manually , but it became difficult to find people who wanted to do the work , and so <unk> loaders were used to load peat directly into the wagons . The success of this process at Hatfield in 1981 lead to it being used at Swinefleet as well . 
 The next development was the introduction of surface milling , which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year . Once an area had been drained , all vegetation was removed from the surface , and a thin layer of peat was removed by a mechanical harvester . It was stockpiled on the moors , and later loaded into wagons by a <unk> loader , to be bagged at the works . Most peat by this time was used for compost or in <unk> . The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods , and the mesh @-@ sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it . A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun , but by 1989 , solid steel wagons were being fabricated , reusing the frames from the original wagons . All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990 , with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards . Trains of the new wagons were much heavier , particularly when loaded with milled peat , and the existing locomotives were inadequate . Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives , and three machines were ordered from <unk> of Germany . Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990 , and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991 . Each consisted of a CHL @-@ 60G master unit , rated at 65 kilowatts ( 87 hp ) with a bonnet and cab , and a CHL @-@ <unk> slave unit , looking more like a flat @-@ bed truck , with a second hydraulic motor . They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced , with the four @-@ axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track , and they were very popular with their operators . By the late 1990s , they were wearing out , and enquiries were made , with a view to purchasing replacements . Alan Keef designed a Bo @-@ Bo locomotive for use of the moors , but the cost was too great , and the company rebuilt two of the <unk> locomotive and slave units . The work included replacing the original 5 @-@ cylinder engines with 6 @-@ cylinder models , improving the sanding gear and driver 's seating arrangements , and fitting a more reliable air @-@ conditioning system for the cab . Lack of funds prevented the third <unk> being upgraded . They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005 , and on Hatfield Moors until 2006 . They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased , and were still there in 2008 . 
 In 1935 , there were 20 miles ( 32 km ) of tracks on Thorne Moors , with 150 peat wagons and 18 flat wagons . There was an additional 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) of temporary track . 50 peat wagons and six flat wagons ran on 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) of permanent track on Hatfield Moors , where there were 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) of temporary track . By 1989 , there were about 8 miles ( 13 km ) of permanent track on Hatfield Moors , and double that on Thorne Moors . Following the arrival of the Dutch workers in the 1890s , the community continued to expand with the arrival of workers from the Netherlands until about 1912 , but most had returned to their country of origin by 1914 . In the 1930s , the British Moss Litter Company employed around 160 people , and haulage was achieved by twelve horses . During the Second World War , the Ministry of Supply ran the works , and the workforce dropped to 138 , although there were still twelve horses . After the war , several of the men were assisted by their wives , who helped with the stacking of the peat , but did not get paid for their labour . Numbers had dropped to 118 by the 1960s , although a number of unpaid wives were still working on the moors . With the increasing sales of peat for gardeners , the workforce increased to 185 by the mid @-@ 1970s , swelled by up to 90 contract workers during busy periods . The total annual output of dried peat at this time was around 45 @,@ 000 tonnes , produced from 400 @,@ 000 tonnes of wet peat , all of it going to the horticultural industry . Swinefleet Works stopped production in July 2000 , and was fully decommissioned by September . Subsequently , peat from Thorne Moors was transferred to Hatfield for processing .

 Several redundant locomotives were bought for preservation by Cliff Lawson of Tring . The group included three machines made by Ruston and Hornsby , two made by Hunslet , and two made by Lister . The eighth engine bought was the <unk> , which was a hybrid made from the frames of two machines . Restoration involved splitting the components apart , and using them to rebuild both of the original locomotives , resulting in nine locomotives being preserved . Lawson re @-@ gauged all of them to 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) , and they have all been restored to working order . Lister <unk> was loaned to the Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery in 2007 . 
 The Crowle <unk> Railway is hoping to relay a stretch of track near Crowle , and run some of the original locomotives on it . The Society has obtained one of the original Simplex locomotives and two of the <unk> , including all three slave units . 
 = OS MX3000 = 
 MX3000 is an electric train used on Oslo Metro in Oslo , Norway . The multiple units are produced by Siemens , who started serial delivery in 2007 . Seventy @-@ eight three @-@ car units have been ordered by Kollektivtransportproduksjon , and five by Akershus County Municipality . They replaced the older T1000 and T1300 stock that was used on the Oslo Metro since 1966 . By 2010 , the last T1000 and T1300 trains have been retired and replaced by 83 three @-@ car units . 32 additional sets were ordered , and the final train set was delivered in 2014 , increasing the fleet to 115 units . 
 The trains are built as units of three cars , though they are often operated as double units . Empty 12 wagons ( four unit ) trains are seen every night , going from the main service area at Ryen to Stortinget metro station , where they are ready to be decoupled into shorter trains for the next day . The units are 54 @.@ 14 meters ( 177 ft 7 in ) long , and weigh 98 tonnes ( 96 long tons ; 108 short tons ) empty . They have a power output of 1 @,@ 680 kilowatts ( 2 @,@ 250 hp ) , allowing speeds of 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) . Seated capacity is 138 seats , and total capacity is 493 passengers . New features for the Oslo Metro introduced with the MX3000 include air conditioning ( only in the driver 's cab ) , air suspension , regenerative brakes and batteries for operating at the depot . The first series of 33 units were ordered in 2003 , followed by an additional order for 30 in 2005 , 15 in 2008 , and 32 in December 2010 . The trains have been financed by Oslo Package 2 , and each unit costs about NOK 45 million . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1966 , the Oslo Metro opened as an upgrade of two existing suburban tramways , the <unk> and Lambertseter Lines . By 1970 , the system was supplemented by the <unk> and Furuset Lines . They only operated to the eastern suburbs . In 1987 , the system was expanded to connect to the western network , that remained a suburban tramway with overhead wires , two @-@ car platforms and an inferior signaling system . In 1993 , the Sognsvann Line was converted to metro standard , with the Røa Line following two years later . When the order for the MX3000 trains was placed , the Kolsås- and Holmenkoll Lines still used overhead wires , and would not be able to use the new stock . Both systems were at the time being considered for conversion to light rail systems , that would connect to the <unk> and Ullevål Hageby Line , respectively . 
 The old fleet of T1000 and T1300 consisted of 195 cars in eight series . The T1000 was the original series delivered between 1966 and 1978 , while the T1300 was a later adoption built until 1987 . The T1000 series has only a third rail shoe , while the T1300 also has a pantograph , and could be used on the Kolsås- and Holmenkoll Lines . In 1995 , six two @-@ car T2000 units were delivered for the Holmenkoll Line . They were , at the time , proposed as a possible replacement for all the T1000 and T1300 stock , but were prone to technical problems . They featured both third rail shoes and pantographs . 
 In 1996 , the work to establish a financing package for new investments in public transport in Akershus and Oslo started . It was passed , in 2001 , by the city and county councils , as well as the Norwegian Parliament . Oslo Package 2 allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance , among other things , new trains for the metro . The initial order by Oslo Sporveier was for 33 units ( or 99 cars ) , and was approved by the board on 28 June 2003 . The initial order cost NOK 1 @.@ 6 billion , and included options for further orders . Five other manufactures had been rejected during the procurement process . Combined with other investments in the network , the new trains will allow faster travel times on the metro . 
 In 2005 , the city council voted to replace all existing T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000 , increasing the quantity by another 30 units . With the second order , the price had increased to NOK 2 @.@ 5 billion . Two test units were delivered in October 2005 , and the serial production started in April 2006 , with the first deliveries in April 2007 . With the delivery of the new trains , Oslo Sporveier received criticism that they had been disloyal to the old red color of the metro , and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from the 1960s through the 80s . During the first 30 days , there occurred two errors : one in the closing mechanism of the doors , and one with a switch in the cab that was not water tight . However , it turned out that Oslo Sporveier had not been accurate enough in specifying the energy consumption of the trains , and the rectifiers on parts of the line needed to be upgraded to supply sufficient power to the trains . During 2007 , there were four incidents where the trains were not able to brake at stations . The worst incident occurred when a train slid the 1 @.@ 3 kilometers ( 0 @.@ 81 mi ) from Blindern to Majorstuen . 
 Following the 2006 decision to convert the Kolsås Line to metro standard , Akershus County Council announced they would order five units . In November 2006 , the city government proposed that the maintenance of the new trains be privatized . This resulted in protests from the employees , who campaigned by refusing to work overtime . As a result , after a few weeks , the company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service . The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the Liberal Party agreed to postpone the matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009 . As part of the agreement , a new limited company , Oslo Vognselskap , wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon , would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies Oslo T @-@ banedrift and Oslo Sporvognsdrift , the latter being the operator of the tramway . Responsibility for the debt accumulated for buying the trains is to be managed by Oslo Vognselskap , while operation and management of the maintenance contracts was transferred to Oslo T @-@ banedrift . 
 In January 2008 , an addition 15 units were ordered by Oslo , with an option for further orders later . This will allow all the eastern lines to have a 7 @.@ 5 @-@ minute headway on their services into the city center , instead of the current 15 @-@ minute headway . Trains would start using the balloon loop located at Stortinget , and the western lines will continue to have a 15 @-@ minute headway . At the same time , the trains serving the Ring Line will be extended to six cars . The order cost NOK 675 million . In addition , Akershus finalized their order for five units , costing NOK 240 million . Unlike the Oslo @-@ owned units , Akershus ' five units will be owned by the transit authority Ruter . The same year , the city council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkoll Line to metro standard , to allow six @-@ car MX3000 trains to be the main mode of transport to Holmenkollen during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011 . This allowed 9 @,@ 000 people per hour to be transported to the sports venue . In 2009 , the T2000 units were taken out of service , and on 22 April 2010 the last T1300 was taken out of service , making the MX3000 the only units to be used on the Oslo Metro . The city council was considering ordering 15 additional MX3000 to replace the T2000 , as an alternative for a NOK 50 @-@ million renovation . 
 In November 2010 , the Accident Investigation Board Norway criticized the braking system of the trains . During 2009 , there were 83 incidents where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track . The Accident Investigation Board found that the metro had conducted insufficient testing of the braking system on steep slippery lines , had not adjusted the brakes satisfactorily , and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently . In December 2010 , Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three @-@ car units , bringing the total order up to 115 three @-@ car units . The last trains will be delivered in 2012 . There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase , with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase , while the right @-@ winged parties voted to order 19 units . The extra trains will make it possible to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line ( Line 1 ) with six @-@ car lines , compared to a situation with only three @-@ car trains on the Lambertseter Line , the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line ( lines 4 and 6 ) would only use three @-@ car trains . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The MX3000 is a three @-@ car electric multiple unit built exclusively for the Oslo Metro by Siemens in Vienna , Austria . It is a modification of trains used on the Vienna U @-@ Bahn . The units are designed by Porsche Design Studio . Unlike the red predecessors , the trains are painted white with black and grey detailing . The chassis is in aluminum . A three @-@ car train is 54 @.@ 14 meters ( 177 @.@ 6 ft ) long ; the end cars are 18 @.@ 11 meters ( 59 @.@ 4 ft ) long each , while the center car is 17 @.@ 92 meters ( 58 @.@ 8 ft ) long . The cars are 3 @.@ 16 meters ( 10 @.@ 4 ft ) wide and 3 @.@ 68 meters ( 12 @.@ 1 ft ) tall . An empty three @-@ car unit weighs 98 tonnes ( 96 long tons ; 108 short tons ) , while it with full payload weighs 147 tonnes ( 145 long tons ; 162 short tons ) . This gives a maximum axle load of 12 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 12 @.@ 3 long tons ; 13 @.@ 8 short tons ) . 
 Each three @-@ car unit has 138 seats , and a total capacity of 493 passengers . The height of the floor is 1 @.@ 12 meters ( 3 ft 8 in ) above the track , allowing step @-@ free access to the platforms . There are three doors on each side of each car , measuring 1 @,@ 300 millimeters ( 51 in ) wide and 1 @,@ 900 millimeters ( 75 in ) high . Unlike the older T1000 trains , the triple @-@ car configuration allows passengers to walk between the cars . Combined with a better spatial design , it reduces the feeling of crowding . The MX3000 also introduced air conditioning in the driver 's cab . The units run either in single configuration ( with three cars ) or in multiple ( with six cars ) . 
 Each car is equipped with four three @-@ phase asynchronous 140 @-@ kilowatt ( 190 hp ) motors , giving each three @-@ car unit a power output of 1 @,@ 680 kilowatts ( 2 @,@ 250 hp ) . In each car , the four motors are fed by the car 's own insulated @-@ gate bipolar transistor . They transform the 750 volt direct current collected from the third rail shoe to the three @-@ phase alternating current used in the motors . The frequency and amplitude of the current fed to the engines varies depending on the train 's speed . The MX3000 introduced regenerative brakes , that allow the electromagnetic brakes to feed power back to the power supply when braking . In addition , there is a back @-@ up disc brake on each axle . Acceleration in the range 0 to 40 kilometers per hour ( 0 to 25 mph ) is limited to 1 @.@ 3 meters per second squared ( 4 @.@ 3 ft / s2 ) . In this phase , the fully loaded train uses 5 @.@ 0 <unk> . For use in areas without a third rail , such as at depots , the trains are equipped with a 110 V battery . This removes the need for shunting at the depots , and makes maintenance more cost efficient . Energy usage is reduced by 30 % , estimated to save the operating company NOK 13 million per year , compared to using the old stocks . 
 There are two bogies per car , each with two axles . The wheel diameter is 850 millimeters ( 33 in ) for new wheels , and 770 millimeters ( 30 in ) when fully worn @-@ down . The center distance between the bogies is 11 @.@ 00 meters ( 36 @.@ 09 ft ) . The primary suspension is steel coil spring between the axles and the bogies , with a secondary air suspension between the frame and the bogies . The latter , which the MX3000 was the first to use on the metro , gives reduced noise , better comfort and makes it possible to adjust the height with changed passenger weight . 
 The units are controlled by a distributed system connected by a double multifunction vehicle bus . It has two vehicle control units , that monitor and control all main functions of the train ; in addition , there are systems for controlling the brakes , traction , doors , ventilation , passenger information system and compressor . Like the older stock , the train 's speed is controlled by an automatic train protection ( ATP ) system . The speed codes are transferred from the ATP points in the infrastructure , using 75 hertz pulses in the tracks . The trains pick up the signals via antennas . The speed codes are 15 km / h ( 9 @.@ 3 mph ) , 30 km / h ( 19 mph ) , 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) and 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) . They are informed to the engineer via signals in the driver 's cab ; in addition , the system will automatically reduce the speed , should the limit be exceeded . The driver can put the trains in an automatic mode , where the train itself adjusts the trains speed to the speed limit . The driver is always responsible for starting and halting the train at stations . The driver 's cabs are more ergonomic than in the T1000 , and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens . 
 = = Numbering = = 
 The first 99 train sets were numbered 3001 to <unk> . When the 100th set was delivered the numbering continued with <unk> and will continue with <unk> and so on . Many of the train sets have also been given a girls ' name . 
 The three individual cars that make up a train set are distinguished by the second digit . For example , train set 3001 consists of the cars <unk> , <unk> , and 3301 . 
 = SMS Kaiser Karl VI = 
 SMS Kaiser Karl VI ( " His Majesty 's Ship Kaiser Karl VI " ) was the second of three armored cruisers built by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste between June 1896 and May 1900 , when she was commissioned into the fleet . Kaiser Karl VI represented a significant improvement over the preceding design — Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia — being faster and more heavily armed and armored . She provided the basis for the third design , Sankt Georg , which featured further incremental improvements . Having no overseas colonies to patrol , Austria @-@ Hungary built the ship solely to reinforce its battle fleet . 
 Kaiser Karl VI spent the first decade in service rotating between the training and reserve squadrons , alternating with Sankt Georg . In 1910 , Kaiser Karl VI went on a major overseas cruise to South America , visiting Brazil , Uruguay , and Argentina ; this was the last trans @-@ Atlantic voyage of an Austro @-@ Hungarian warship . After the outbreak of war , she was mobilized into the Cruiser Flotilla , which spent the majority of the war moored at Cattaro . The lengthy inactivity eventually led to the Cattaro Mutiny in February 1918 , which the crew of Kaiser Karl VI joined . After the mutiny collapsed , Kaiser Karl VI and several other warships were decommissioned to reduce the number of idle sailors . After the war , she was allocated as a war prize to Britain and was sold to ship @-@ breakers in Italy , where she was scrapped in 1920 . 
 = = Design = = 
 In the 1890s , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy began to build armored cruisers to support the battle fleet and to perform some of the roles then reserved only for battleships . The first vessel , Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia , was built as an enlarged version of the protected cruiser Kaiserin Elisabeth , with a more powerful armament and heavier armor . Maria Theresia was followed by an improved cruiser , Kaiser Karl VI , which was about 800 metric tons ( 790 long tons ; 880 short tons ) heavier , about 1 @.@ 5 knots ( 2 @.@ 8 km / h ; 1 @.@ 7 mph ) faster , with much heavier armor . Kaiser Karl VI in turn provided the basis for an even larger ship , which was named Sankt Georg . 
 = = = General characteristics and machinery = = = 
 Kaiser Karl VI was 117 @.@ 9 meters ( 387 ft ) long at the waterline and was 118 @.@ 96 m ( 390 @.@ 3 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 17 @.@ 27 m ( 56 @.@ 7 ft ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 75 m ( 22 @.@ 1 ft ) . She displaced 6 @,@ 166 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 069 long tons ; 6 @,@ 797 short tons ) as designed and up to 6 @,@ 864 t ( 6 @,@ 756 long tons ; 7 @,@ 566 short tons ) at full load . Her crew numbered 535 officers and men . Kaiser Karl VI was fitted with two pole masts for observation . 
 The ship 's propulsion system consisted of two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion engines that drove a pair of screw propellers . The engines were built at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino ( STT ) shipyard in Trieste that built the ship . Steam was provided by water @-@ tube boilers manufactured by Maudslay , Sons and Field of Britain . The engines were rated at 12 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 8 @,@ 900 kW ) and produced a top speed of 20 @.@ 83 knots ( 38 @.@ 58 km / h ; 23 @.@ 97 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Kaiser Karl VI was armed with a main battery of two large @-@ caliber guns and several medium @-@ caliber pieces . She carried two 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) L / 40 C / 94 guns manufactured by Krupp in single gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and one aft . Eight 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 40 guns mounted individually in casemates rounded out her offensive armament . She was armed with sixteen 4 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) L / 44 guns built by Škoda and two 4 @.@ 7 cm L / 33 Hotchkiss guns for close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats . She carried several smaller weapons , including a pair of 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine guns and two 7 cm landing guns . Kaiser Karl VI was also equipped with a pair of 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , one on each broadside . 
 The ship was protected by a main armored belt that was 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) thick in the central portion that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces , and reduced to 170 mm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) on either end . She had an armored deck that was 40 to 60 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick . Her two gun turrets had 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick faces , and the 15 cm guns had 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick casemates . The conning tower had 200 mm thick sides and a 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick roof . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Named for the 18th @-@ century Holy Roman Emperor , Karl VI , Kaiser Karl VI was built at the STT shipyard in Trieste . Her keel was laid on 1 June 1896 and her completed hull was launched on 4 October 1898 . Fitting @-@ out work then commenced , which lasted until 23 May 1900 when the ship was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet . Starting from her commissioning , Kaiser Karl VI frequently served in the training squadron , along with the three Habsburg @-@ class battleships , though she alternated in the squadron with the armored cruiser Sankt Georg . Once the summer training schedule was completed each year , the ships of the training squadron were demobilized in the reserve squadron , which was held in a state of partial readiness . In 1900 , she served as the flagship of then @-@ Rear Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli in the training squadron , along with Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia . During the summer maneuvers of June 1901 , she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral G. Ritter von Brosch , commander of the reserve squadron . The other major ships in the squadron included the old ironclad Tegetthoff and the cruiser SMS Kaiser Franz Joseph I. 
 In mid @-@ 1910 , Kaiser Karl VI conducted the last trans @-@ Atlantic cruise of an Austrian vessel , when she visited Brazil , Uruguay and Argentina . On 25 May , she represented Austria @-@ Hungary at the centennial of Argentina 's May Revolution , which won the country 's independence from Spain . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 On 28 June 1914 , Archduke Franz Ferdinand , the heir to the Austro @-@ Hungarian throne , was assassinated in Sarajevo ; the assassination sparked the July Crisis and ultimately the First World War , which broke out a month later on 28 July . The German battlecruiser SMS Goeben , which had been assigned to the Mediterranean Division , sought the protection of the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet , and so Admiral Anton Haus sent the fleet , including Kaiser Karl VI , south on 7 August to assist his German ally . Goeben 's commander , Admiral Wilhelm Souchon , intended to use the Austro @-@ Hungarian move as a feint to distract the British Mediterranean Fleet which was pursuing Goeben ; Souchon instead took his ship to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire . Their decoy mission complete , Kaiser Karl VI and the rest of the fleet returned to port without engaging any British forces . 
 On 8 August , Montenegrin gun batteries on Mount Lovćen began shelling the Austro @-@ Hungarian at Cattaro . At the time , Kaiser Karl VI was the only large warship in the harbor , and so she assisted the local army artillery in attempting to suppress the hostile guns . The Austro @-@ Hungarian gunners were aided by navy seaplanes that could spot the fall of their shots . On 13 September , the three Monarch @-@ class coastal defense ships arrived to strengthen the Austro @-@ Hungarian force . Five days later , a French artillery battery was landed in Montenegro to reinforce the guns on Lovćen with the aim of eventually capturing the port , which prompted the Austro @-@ Hungarians to send the pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Radetzky with its 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns . By 27 October , the French and Montenegrin gun batteries had been silenced , and the French abandoned its attempt to seize Cattaro . 
 By the end of August , the mobilization of the fleet was complete ; Kaiser Karl VI was assigned to the Cruiser Flotilla , which was commanded by Vice Admiral Paul Fiedler . For most of the war , the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro , though the armored cruisers were too slow to operate with the newer Novara @-@ class cruisers that carried out the bulk of offensive operations . In May 1915 , Italy declared war on the Central Powers . The Austro @-@ Hungarians continued their strategy of serving as a fleet in being , which would tie down the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces . Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought . 
 By early 1918 , the long periods of inactivity had begun to wear on the crews of several warships at Cattaro , including Kaiser Karl VI . On 1 February , the Cattaro Mutiny broke out , starting aboard Sankt Georg and quickly spreading to Kaiser Karl VI . Officers were confined to their quarters while a committee of sailors met to formulate a list of demands , which ranged from longer periods of leave and better rations to an end to the war , based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson 's Fourteen Points . The following day , shore batteries loyal to the government fired on the old ironclad Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf , which prompted many of the mutinous ships to abandon the effort . Late in the day on 2 February , the red flags were struck from Kaiser Karl VI and she rejoined the loyalist ships in the harbor . The next morning , the Erzherzog Karl @-@ class battleships of the III Division arrived in Cattaro , which convinced the last holdouts to surrender . Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly and four men were executed . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 In the aftermath of the Cattaro Mutiny , most of the obsolete warships of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , including Kaiser Karl VI , were decommissioned to reduce the number of idle warships . On 3 November 1918 , the Austro @-@ Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy , ending their participation in the conflict . After the end of the war , Kaiser Karl VI was ceded as a war prize to Great Britain , under the terms of the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye . She was then sold to ship breakers in Italy and broken up for scrap after 1920 . 
 = Myrrha = 
 Myrrha ( Greek : <unk> ) , also known as Smyrna ( Greek : <unk> ) , is the mother of Adonis in Greek mythology . She was transformed into a myrrh tree after having had intercourse with her father and gave birth to Adonis as a tree . Although the tale of Adonis has Semitic roots , it is uncertain from where the myth of Myrrha emerged , though it was likely from Cyprus . 
 The myth details the incestuous relationship between Myrrha and her father , Cinyras . Myrrha falls in love with her father and tricks him into sexual intercourse . After discovering her identity , Cinyras draws his sword and pursues Myrrha . She flees across Arabia and , after nine months , turns to the gods for help . They take pity on her and transform her into a myrrh @-@ tree . While in plant form , Myrrha gives birth to Adonis . According to legend , the aromatic <unk> of the myrrh @-@ tree are Myrrha 's tears . 
 The most familiar form of the myth was recounted in the Metamorphoses of Ovid , and the story was the subject of the most famous work ( now lost ) of the poet <unk> Cinna . Several alternate versions appeared in the Bibliotheca , the Fabulae of Hyginus , and the Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis , with major variations depicting Myrrha 's father as the Assyrian king Theias or depicting Aphrodite as having engineered the tragic liaison . Critical interpretation of the myth has considered Myrrha 's refusal of conventional sexual relations to have provoked her incest , with the ensuing transformation to tree as a silencing punishment . It has been suggested that the taboo of incest marks the difference between culture and nature and that Ovid 's version of Myrrha showed this . A translation of Ovid 's Myrrha , done by English poet John Dryden in 1700 , has been interpreted as a critique of the society of that day linking Myrrha to Mary II and Cinyras to James II . 
 In post @-@ classical times , Myrrha has had widespread influence in Western culture . She was mentioned in the Divine Comedy by Dante , was an inspiration for Mirra by Vittorio Alfieri , and was alluded to in Mathilda by Mary Shelley . In the play Sardanapalus by Byron , a character named Myrrha appeared , whom critics interpreted as a symbol of Byron 's dream of romantic love . The myth of Myrrha was one of 24 tales retold in Tales from Ovid by English poet Ted Hughes . In art , Myrrha 's seduction of her father has been illustrated by German engraver Virgil Solis , her tree @-@ metamorphosis by French engraver Bernard <unk> and Italian painter Marcantonio Franceschini , while French engraver Gustave Doré chose to depict Myrrha in Hell as a part of his series of engravings for Dante 's Divine Comedy . In music , she has appeared in pieces by Sousa and Ravel . She was also the inspiration for several species ' scientific names and an asteroid . 
 = = Origin and etymology = = 
 The myth of Myrrha is closely linked to that of her son , Adonis , which has been easier to trace . Adonis is the Hellenized form of the Phoenician word " <unk> " , meaning " my lord " . It is believed that the cult of Adonis was known to the Greeks from around the sixth century B.C. , but it is unquestionable that they came to know it through contact with Cyprus . Around this time , the cult of Adonis is noted in the Book of Ezekiel in Jerusalem , though under the Babylonian name Tammuz . 
 Adonis originally was a Phoenician god of fertility representing the spirit of vegetation . It is further speculated that he was an avatar of the version of Ba 'al , worshipped in Ugarit . It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna , and who her father was , originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first encountered the myth . However , it is clear that the Greeks added much to the Adonis @-@ Myrrha story , before it was first recorded by classical scholars . 
 Over the centuries Myrrha , the girl , and myrrh , the fragrance , have been linked etymologically . Myrrh was precious in the ancient world , and was used for embalming , medicine , perfume , and incense . The Modern English word myrrh ( Old English : <unk> ) derives from the Latin Myrrha ( or <unk> or <unk> , all are synonymous Latin words for the tree substance ) . The Latin Myrrha originated from the Ancient Greek <unk> , but , ultimately , the word is of Semitic origin , with roots in the Arabic <unk> , the Hebrew <unk> , and the Aramaic <unk> , all meaning " bitter " as well as referring to the plant . Regarding <unk> , the word is a Greek dialectic form of myrrha . 
 Myrrh in the Bible is referenced as one of the most desirable fragrances , and though mentioned alongside frankincense it is usually more expensive . Several Old Testament passages refer to myrrh . In the Song of Solomon , which according to scholars dates to either the tenth century B.C. as a Hebrew oral tradition or to the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century B.C. , myrrh is referenced seven times making the Song of Solomon the passage in the Old Testament referring to myrrh the most , often with erotic overtones . In the New Testament the substance is famously associated with the birth of Christ when the magi presented their gifts of " gold , frankincense , and myrrh " .

 = = = Ovid 's version = = = 
 Published in 8 A.D. the Metamorphoses of Ovid has become one of the most influential poems by the Latin writers . The Metamorphoses showed that Ovid was more interested in questioning how the laws interfered with people 's lives than in writing epic tales like Virgil 's Aeneid and Homer 's Odyssey . The Metamorphoses is not narrated by Ovid , but rather by the characters inside the stories . The myth of Myrrha and Cinyras is sung by Orpheus in the tenth book of Metamorphoses after he has told the myth of Pygmalion and before he turns to the tale of Venus and Adonis . As the myth of Myrrha is also the longest tale sung by Orpheus ( 205 lines ) and the only story that corresponds to his announced theme of girls punished for forbidden desire , it is considered the centerpiece of the song . Ovid opens the myth with a warning to the audience that this is a myth of great horror , especially to fathers and daughters : 
 The story I am going to tell is a horrible one : I beg that daughters and fathers should hold themselves aloof , while I sing , or if they find my songs enchanting , let them refuse to believe this part of my tale , and suppose that it never happened : or else , if they believe that it did happen , they must believe also in the punishment that followed . 
 According to Ovid , Myrrha was the daughter of King Cinyras and Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus . It is stated that Cupid was not to blame for Myrrha 's incestuous love for her father , Cinyras . Ovid further comments that hating one 's father is a crime , but Myrrha 's love was a greater crime . Ovid therefore blamed it on the Furies . 
 Over several verses , Ovid depicts the psychic struggle Myrrha faces between her sexual desire for her father and the social shame she would face for acting thereon . Sleepless , and losing all hope , she attempted suicide ; but was discovered by her nurse , in whom she confided . The nurse tried to make Myrrha suppress the infatuation , but later agreed to help Myrrha into her father 's bed if she promised that she would not again try to kill herself . 
 During the Ceres ' festival , the worshiping women ( including Cenchreis , Myrrha 's mother ) were not to be touched by men for nine nights ; wherefore the nurse told Cinyras of a girl deeply in love with him , giving a false name . The affair lasted several nights in complete darkness to conceal Myrrha 's identity , until Cinyras wanted to know the identity of his paramour . Upon bringing in a lamp , and seeing his daughter , the king attempted to kill her on the spot , but Myrrha escaped . 
 Thereafter Myrrha walked in exile for nine months , past the palms of Arabia and the fields of <unk> , until she reached <unk> . Afraid of death and tired of life , and pregnant as well , she begged the gods for a solution , and was transformed into the myrrh tree , with the sap thereof representing her tears . Later , Lucina freed the newborn Adonis from the tree . 
 = = = Other versions = = = 
 The myth of Myrrha has been chronicled in several other works than Ovid 's Metamorphoses . Among the scholars who recounted it are Apollodorus , Hyginus , and Antoninus Liberalis . All three versions differ . 
 In his Bibliotheca , written around the 1st century B.C. Apollodorus tells of three possible <unk> for Adonis . In the first he states that Cinyras arrived in Cyprus with a few followers and founded Paphos , and that he married <unk> , eventually becoming king of Cyprus through her family . Cinyras had five children by <unk> : the two boys , <unk> and Adonis , and three daughters , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . The daughters at some point became victims of Aphrodite 's wrath and had intercourse with foreigners , ultimately dying in Egypt . 
 For the second possible parentage of Adonis , Apollodorus quotes Hesiod , who postulates that Adonis could be the child of Phoenix and <unk> . He elaborates no further on this statement . 
 For the third option , he quotes <unk> , who states that King Theias of Assyria had a daughter called Smyrna . Smyrna failed to honor Aphrodite , incurring the wrath of the goddess , by whom was made to fall in love with her father ; and with the aid of her nurse she deceived him for twelve nights until her identity was discovered . Smyrna fled , but her father later caught up with her . Smyrna then prayed that the gods would make her invisible , prompting them to turn her into a tree , which was named the Smyrna . Ten months later the tree cracked and Adonis was born from it . 
 In his Fabulae , written around 1 A.D. Hyginus states that King Cinyras of Assyria had a daughter by his wife , Cenchreis . The daughter was named Smyrna and the mother boasted that her child excelled even Venus in beauty . Angered , Venus punished the mother by cursing Smyrna to fall in love with her father . After the nurse had prevented Smyrna from committing suicide , she helped her engage her father in sexual intercourse . When Smyrna became pregnant , she hid in the woods from shame . Venus pitied the girl 's fate , changing her into a myrrh tree , from which was born Adonis . 
 In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis , written somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd century A.D. , the myth is set in Phoenicia , near Mount Lebanon . Here King Thias , son of Belus and <unk> , had a daughter named Smyrna . Being of great beauty , she was sought by men from far and wide . She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her . Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father and did not want anybody else . At first she hid her desires , eventually telling her nurse , Hippolyte , the secret of her true feelings . Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him , but in secret . The affair lasted for an extended period of time , and Smyrna became pregnant . At this point , Thias desired to know who she was so he hid a light , illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna 's identity when she entered . In shock , Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child . She then raised her hands and said a prayer , which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree . Thias killed himself , and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 The myth of Myrrha has been interpreted in various ways . The transformation of Myrrha in Ovid 's version has been interpreted as a punishment for her breaking the social rules through her incestuous relationship with her father . Like Byblis who fell in love with her brother , Myrrha is transformed and rendered voiceless making her unable to break the taboo of incest . 
 Myrrha has also been thematically linked to the story of Lot 's daughters . They live with their father in an isolated cave and because their mother is dead they decide to <unk> Lot 's mind with wine and seduce him in order to keep the family alive through him . Nancy Miller comments on the two myths : 
 [ Lot 's daughters ' ] incest is sanctioned by reproductive necessity ; because it lacks consequences , this story is not a socially recognized narrative paradigm for incest . [ ... ] In the cases of both Lot 's daughters and Myrrha , the daughter 's seduction of the father has to be covert . While other incest configurations - mother @-@ son , sibling - permit consensual agency , father @-@ daughter incest does not ; when the daughter displays transgressive sexual desire , the prohibitive father appears . 
 Myrrha has been interpreted as developing from a girl into a woman in the course of the story : in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors , in that way denying the part of herself that is normally dedicated to Aphrodite . The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made into a woman in the grip of an uncontrollable lust . The marriage between her father and mother is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws , profane as well as divine . The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates the most extreme version a seduction can take : the union between two persons who by social norms and laws are strictly held apart . 
 James Richard Ellis has argued that the incest taboo is fundamental to a civilized society . Building on Sigmund Freud 's theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid 's version of the myth of Myrrha . When the girl has been gripped by desire , she laments her humanity , for if she and her father were animals , there would be no bar to their union . 
 That Myrrha is transformed into a myrrh tree has also been interpreted to have influenced the character of Adonis . Being the child of both a woman and a tree he is a split person . In Ancient Greece the word Adonis could mean both " perfume " and " lover " and likewise Adonis is both the perfume made from the aromatic drops of myrrh as well as the human lover who seduces two goddesses . 
 In her essay " What Nature Allows the Jealous Laws Forbid " literary critic Mary <unk> Doll compares the love between the two male protagonists of Annie Proulx ' book Brokeback Mountain ( 1997 ) with the love Myrrha has for her father in Ovid 's Metamorphoses . Doll suggests that both Ovid 's and Proulx ' main concerns are civilization and its discontents and that their use of images of nature uncovers similar understandings of what is " natural " when it comes to who and how one should love . On the subject of Ovid ’ s writing about love Doll states : 
 In Ovid ’ s work no love is " taboo " unless it arises out of a need for power and control . A widespread instance for the latter during the Roman Empire was the practice by the elite to take nubile young girls as lovers or mistresses , girls who could be as young as daughters . Such a practice was considered normal , natural . 
 Cinyras ' relationship with a girl on his daughter 's age was therefore not unnatural , but Myrrha 's being in love with her own father was . Doll elaborates further on this stating that Myrrha 's lamenting that animals can mate father and daughter without problems is a way for Ovid to express a paradox : in nature a father @-@ daughter relationship is not unnatural , but it is in human society . On this Doll concludes that " Nature follows no laws . There is no such thing as " natural law " " . Still , Ovid distances himself in three steps from the horrifying story : 
 First he does not tell the story himself , but has one of his in @-@ story characters , Orpheus , sing it ; second , Ovid tells his audience not even to believe the story ( cf. quote in " Ovid 's version " ) ; third , he has Orpheus congratulate Rome , Ovid 's home town , for its being far away from the land where this story took place ( Cyprus ) . By distancing himself , Doll writes , Ovid lures his audience to keep listening . First then does Ovid begin telling the story describing Myrrha , her father and their relationship , which Doll compares to the mating of Cupid and Psyche : here the lovemaking occurs in complete darkness and only the initiator ( Cupid ) knows the identity of the other as well . Myrrha 's metamorphosing into a tree is read by Doll as a metaphor where the tree incarnates the secret . As a side effect , Doll notes , the metamorphosis also alters the idea of incest into something natural for the imagination to think about . Commenting on a Freudian analysis of the myth stating that Ovid " disconcertingly suggests that [ father @-@ lust ] might be an unspoken universal of human experience " Doll notes that Ovid 's stories work like metaphors : they are meant to give insight into the human psyche . Doll states that the moments when people experience moments like those of father @-@ lust are repressed and unconscious , which means that they are a natural part of growing and that most grow out of it sometime . She concludes about Ovid and his version of Myrrha that : " What is perverted , for Ovid , is the use of sex as a power tool and the blind acceptance of sexual male power as a cultural norm . " 
 In 2008 the newspaper The Guardian named Myrrha 's relationship with her father as depicted in Metamorphoses by Ovid as one of the top ten stories of incestuous love ever . It complimented the myth for being more disturbing than any of the other incestuous relationships depicted in the Metamorphoses .

 One of the earliest recordings of a play inspired by the myth of Myrrha is in the Antiquities of the Jews , written in 93 A.D. by the Roman @-@ Jewish historian Flavius Josephus . A tragedy entitled Cinyras is mentioned , wherein the main character , Cinyras , is to be slain along with his daughter Myrrha , and " a great deal of fictitious blood was shed " . No further details are given about the plot of this play . 
 Myrrha appears in the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri , where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell , in the tenth <unk> ( ditch ) . Here she and other <unk> such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases , Myrrha 's being madness . Myrrha 's suffering in the tenth <unk> indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit . Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha 's <unk> as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity . Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous of the social order in life . 
 Dante had already shown his familiarity with the myth of Myrrha in a prior letter to Emperor Henry VII , which he wrote on 17 April 1311 . Here he compares Florence with " Myrrha , wicked and ungodly , yearning for the embrace of her father , Cinyras " ; a metaphor , Claire <unk> interprets as referring to the way Florence tries to " seduce " Pope Clement V away from Henry VII . It is incestuous because the Pope is the father of all and it is also implied that the city in that way rejects her true husband , the Emperor . 
 In the poem Venus and Adonis , written by William Shakespeare in 1593 Venus refers to Adonis ' mother . In the 34th stanza Venus is lamenting because Adonis is ignoring her approaches and in her heart @-@ ache she says " O , had thy mother borne so hard a mind , She had not brought forth thee , but died unkind . " Shakespeare makes a subtle reference to Myrrha later when Venus picks a flower : " She crops the stalk , and in the breach appears , Green dropping sap , which she compares to tears . " It has been suggested that these plant juices being compared to tears are a parallel to Myrrha 's tears being the drops of myrrh exuding from the myrrh @-@ tree . 
 In another work of Shakespeare , Othello ( 1603 ) , it has been suggested that he has made another reference . In act 5 , scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its constant stream of tears ( Myrrha 's tears ) . The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid 's Metamorphoses , just like his previously written poem , Venus and Adonis , did . 
 The tragedy Mirra by Vittorio Alfieri ( written in 1786 ) is inspired by the story of Myrrha . In the play , Mirra falls in love with her father , Cinyras . Mirra is to be married to Prince Pyrrhus , but decides against it , and leaves him at the altar . In the ending , Mirra has a mental breakdown in front of her father who is infuriated because the prince has killed himself . Owning that she loves Cinyras , Mirra grabs his sword , while he recoils in horror , and kills herself . 
 The novella Mathilda , written by Mary Shelley in 1820 , contains similarities to the myth and mentions Myrrha . Mathilda is left by her father as a baby after her birth causes the death of her mother , and she does not meet her father until he returns sixteen years later . Then he tells her that he is in love with her , and , when she refuses him , he commits suicide . In chapter 4 , Mathilda makes a direct allusion : " I chanced to say that I thought Myrrha the best of Alfieri 's tragedies . " Audra <unk> Himes , in an essay entitled " Knew shame , and knew desire " , notes a more subtle reference to Myrrha : Mathilda spends the last night before her father ’ s arrival in the woods , but as she returns home the next morning the trees seemingly attempt to encompass her . Himes suggests that the trees can be seen as a parallel to Ovid ’ s metamorphosed Myrrha . 
 The tragedy Sardanapalus by George Gordon Byron published in 1821 and produced in 1834 is set in Assyria , 640 B.C. , under King Sardanapalus . The play deals with the revolt against the extravagant king and his relationship to his favourite slave Myrrha . Myrrha made Sardanapalus appear at the head of his armies , but after winning three successive battles in this way he was eventually defeated . A beaten man , Myrrha persuaded Sardanapalus to place himself on a funeral pyre which she would ignite and subsequently leap onto - burning them both alive . The play has been interpreted as an autobiography , with Sardanapalus as Byron 's alter ego , Zarina as Byron 's wife Anne Isabella , and Myrrha as his mistress Teresa . At a more abstract level Myrrha is the desire for freedom driving those who feel trapped or bound , as well as being the incarnation of Byron 's dream of romantic love . Byron knew the story of the mythical Myrrha , if not directly through Ovid 's Metamorphoses , then at least through Alfieri 's Mirra , which he was familiar with . In her essay " A Problem Few Dare <unk> " , Susan J. Wolfson phrases and interprets the relation of the play Sardanapalus and the myth of Myrrha : 
 Although [ Byron 's ] own play evades the full import of this complicated association , Myrrha 's name means that it [ the name 's referring to incest , red . ] cannot be escaped entirely - especially since Ovid 's story of Myrrha 's incest poses a potential reciprocal to the nightmare Byron invents for Sardanapalus , of sympathy with the son who is the object of his mother 's ' incest ' . 
 In 1997 the myth of Myrrha and Cinyras was one of 24 tales from Ovid 's Metamorphoses that were retold by English poet Ted Hughes in his poetical work Tales from Ovid . The work was praised for not directly translating , but instead retelling the story in a language which was as fresh and new for the audience today as Ovid 's texts were to his contemporary audience . Hughes was also complimented on his achievements in using humour or horror when describing Myrrha or a flood , respectively . The work received critical acclaim winning the Whitbread Book Of The Year Award 1997 and being adapted to the stage in 1999 , starring <unk> Saba as Myrrha . 
 In 1997 American poet Frank Bidart wrote Desire , which was another retelling of the myth of Myrrha as it was presented in the Metamorphoses by Ovid . The case of Myrrha , critic Langdon Hammer notes , is the worst possible made against desire , because the story of Myrrha shows how sex can lead people to destroy others as well as themselves . He comments that " the " precious bitter resin " into which Myrrha 's tears are changed tastes bitter and sweet , like Desire as a whole " . He further writes : " The <unk> of desire makes Bidart 's long story of submission to it a kind of affirmation . Rather than aberrant , the Ovidian characters come to feel exemplary " . 
 = = = = John Dryden 's translation = = = = 
 In 1700 English poet John Dryden published his translations of myths by Ovid , Homer , and Boccaccio in the volume Fables , Ancient and Modern . Literary critic Anthony W. Lee notes in his essay " Dryden 's Cinyras and Myrrha " that this translation , along with several others , can be interpreted as a subtle comment on the political scene of the late seventeenth @-@ century England . 
 The translation of the myth of Myrrha as it appeared in Ovid 's Metamorphoses is suggested as being a critique of the political settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution . The wife of the leader of this revolution , William of Orange , was Mary , daughter of James II . Mary and William were crowned king and queen of England in 1689 , and because Dryden was deeply sympathetic to James he lost his public offices and fell into political disfavor under the new reign . Dryden turned to translation and infused these translations with political satire in response - the myth of Myrrha being one of these translations . 
 In the opening lines of the poem Dryden describes King Cinyras just as Ovid did as a man who had been happier if he had not become a father . Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier if he had not had his daughter , Mary , who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position . When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor . Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment , according to Lee . A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted . Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament , because it acted without constituted legal authority . Finally the daughter , Mary as Myrrha , is described as an impious outcast from civilization , whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion . When Myrrha craves and achieves her father 's ( Cinyras ' ) bed , Lee sees a parallel to Mary 's ascending James ' throne : both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers . 
 Reading the translation of the myth of Myrrha by Dryden as a comment on the political scene , states Lee , is partly justified by the characterization done by the historian Julian <unk> on the events of the revolution of 1688 : 
 To most a monarch was God 's earthly representative , chosen by Him for the benefit of His people . For men to meddle in that choice was to tamper with the divine order , the inevitable price of which was chaos . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 In music , Myrrha was the subject of an 1876 band piece by John Philip Sousa , Myrrha Gavotte and in 1901 , Maurice Ravel and Andre <unk> each wrote cantatas titled Myrrha . <unk> finished first over Ravel who was third in the Prix de Rome competition . The competition required that the candidates jumped through a series of academic hoops before entering the final where they were to compose a cantata on a prescribed text . Though it was not the best musical piece , the jury praised Ravel 's work for its " melodic charm " and " sincerity of dramatic sentiment " . Musical critic Andrew Clements writing for The Guardian commented on Ravel 's failures at winning the competition : " Ravel 's repeated failure to win the Prix de Rome , the most coveted prize for young composers in France at the turn of the 20th century , has become part of musical folklore . " 
 Italian composer Domenico <unk> 's only opera , premiering in 1920 , was entitled Mirra . The libretto drew on the legend of Myrrha while the music was inspired by Claude Debussy 's Pelléas et Mélisande ( 1902 ) as well as Richard Strauss ' Elektra ( 1909 ) . Suffering from being monotonic , the final showdown between father and daughter , the critics commented , was the only part really making an impact . Mirra remains <unk> 's most ambitious composition and though the music tended to be " eclectic and uneven " , it showed " technical enterprise " . 
 More recently , Kristen Kuster created a choral orchestration , Myrrha , written in 2004 and first performed at Carnegie Hall in 2006 . Kuster stated that the idea for Myrrha came when she was asked by the American Composers Orchestra to write a love @-@ and @-@ erotica themed concert . The concert was inspired by the myth of Myrrha in Ovid 's Metamorphoses and includes excerpts from the volume that " move in and out of the music as though in a dream , or perhaps Myrrha ’ s memory of the events that shaped her fate , " as described by Kuster .

 The Metamorphoses of Ovid has been illustrated by several artists through time . In 1563 in Frankfurt , a German bilingual translation by Johann <unk> was published , featuring the woodcuts of renowned German engraver Virgil Solis . The illustration of Myrrha depicts Myrrha 's deceiving her father as well as her fleeing from him . In 1717 in London , a Latin @-@ English edition of Metamorphoses was published , translated by Samuel Garth and with plates of French engraver Bernard <unk> . The illustration of Myrrha was entitled The Birth of Adonis and featured Myrrha as a tree delivering Adonis while surrounded by women . In 1857 French engraver Gustave Doré made a series of illustrations to Dante 's Divine Comedy , the depiction of Myrrha showing her in the eighth circle of Hell . 
 In 1690 , Italian Baroque painter Marcantonio Franceschini depicted Myrrha as a tree while delivering Adonis in The Birth of Adonis . The painting was included in the art exhibition " Captured Emotions : Baroque Painting in Bologna , 1575 @-@ 1725 " at the J.

Normally the painting is exhibited in the <unk> <unk> Dresden ( English : Dresden State Art Collections ) in Germany as a part of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister ( English : Old Masters Picture Gallery ) . 
 In 1984 , artist Mel Chin created a sculpture based on Doré 's illustration of Myrrha for the Divine Comedy . The sculpture was titled " Myrrha of the Post Industrial World " and depicted a nude woman sitting on a rectangular pedestal . It was an outdoor project in Bryant Park , and the skin of the sculpture was made of perforated steel . Inside was a visible skeleton of polystyrene . When finished , the sculpture was 29 feet tall .

 The Atlanta Flames were a professional ice hockey team based in Atlanta , Georgia from 1972 until 1980 . They played out of the Omni Coliseum and were members of the West and later Patrick divisions of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Along with the New York Islanders , the Flames were created in 1971 as part of the NHL 's conflict with the rival World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . The team enjoyed modest success on the ice , qualifying for the post @-@ season in six of its eight seasons , but failed to win a playoff series and won only two post @-@ season games total . The franchise struggled to draw fans , and after averaging only 10 @,@ 000 per game in 1979 – 80 , was sold and relocated to Alberta to become the Calgary Flames . 
 Eric Vail was the Flames ' top goal scorer with 174 while Tom Lysiak led with 431 points . Guy Chouinard was the lone player to score 50 goals in one season . Goaltender Dan Bouchard led the team in wins ( 166 ) and shutouts ( 20 ) . Two Flames players won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL 's top rookie : Vail in 1974 – 75 and Willi Plett in 1975 – 76 . Bob MacMillan won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the most gentlemanly player in 1978 – 79 . General Manager Cliff Fletcher is the lone member of the Atlanta team to be named to the Hockey Hall of Fame .

 = = = Formation = = = 
 The National Hockey League ( NHL ) , which had grown from six teams in 1966 to fourteen in 1970 , had not planned further expansion until at least 1973 . The formation of a rival major league ( the World Hockey Association ( WHA ) in 1971 ) altered the NHL 's plans and resulted in the two leagues battling for players and markets . The NHL sought to keep the WHA out of the newly constructed Nassau Coliseum in Long Island , New York . The league also opted to place a team in the American south . The NHL announced on November 9 , 1971 , that it was expanding to Long Island and Atlanta . The Atlanta franchise was awarded to Tom Cousins , who also owned the Atlanta Hawks basketball team , and would play out of the Omni Coliseum . The team cost $ 6 million . Cousins named the franchise the Flames in homage to the burning of Atlanta by U.S. Army general William Sherman during the American Civil War . 
 The Flames hired Cliff Fletcher , formerly of the St. Louis Blues , to serve as the team 's general manager . Former Montreal Canadiens player Bernie Geoffrion was hired as the team 's head coach . The team stocked its roster via an expansion draft held on June 6 , 1972 . Fletcher focused on goaltending , choosing Phil Myre with his first selection and rookie Dan Bouchard with his second . Fletcher drafted a competent roster , but one that was young and inexperienced . Two days later , the Flames selected Jacques Richard as the second overall pick in the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft .

They won the game 3 – 2 ; Morris <unk> scored the first goal in franchise history and the first NHL goal in Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum . The team made its home debut one week later on October 14 . Hosting the first event in Omni Coliseum history , the Flames tied the Buffalo Sabres , 1 – 1 , before a sellout crowd of 14 @,@ 568 . The team was respectable through much of the season on the strength of Bouchard and Myre 's goaltending performances , and by mid @-@ January , had a 20 – 19 – 8 win @-@ loss @-@ tie record . The Flames won only five more games through the rest of the season , finishing at 25 – 38 – 15 . Atlanta finished in seventh place in the West Division and missed the playoffs . The team was reasonably successful at the gate : it sold nearly 7 @,@ 000 season tickets by the start of the season , and averaged 12 @,@ 516 fans per game . 
 Tom Lysiak , selected second overall at the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft , joined the Flames for the 1973 – 74 season and made an immediate impact . Lysiak led the Flames in scoring with 64 points and finished second to the Islanders ' Denis Potvin in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL 's top rookie . Improving to 30 – 34 – 14 , the Flames finished fourth in the West and qualified for the 1974 Stanley Cup playoffs . They made their post @-@ season debut against the division @-@ winning Philadelphia Flyers . The first game , played April 9 , 1974 , was a 4 – 1 victory for the Flyers . Philadelphia went on to defeat the Flames in their best @-@ of @-@ seven series with four consecutive wins . Geoffrion was praised for his coaching of the club and finished second in voting for the Jack Adams Award as top coach . 
 The NHL 's expansion to 18 teams in 1974 – 75 resulted in realignment . The league moved to a four division format , placing the Flames in the Patrick Division . Lysiak repeated as the Flames ' top scorer with 77 points while Eric Vail , playing his first full season , led with 39 goals . Vail 's total led all rookies and earned him the Calder Trophy . The team overcame an eight @-@ game losing streak in December and injuries to several key players to post their first winning season with a 34 – 31 – 15 record . However , they finished fourth in the Patrick Division and failed to qualify for the post @-@ season . Citing personal reasons , Geoffrion resigned as head coach late in the season . He was replaced with Fred Creighton , who had been coaching the Flames ' minor league affiliate , the Omaha Knights . Fletcher later credited Geoffrion 's outgoing personality as being the primary reason why people in Atlanta followed the Flames in the franchise 's first seasons while the team 's players later stated an appreciation for Creighton 's more technical coaching and teaching style . 
 = = = 1975 – 1980 = = = 
 Creighton produced a consistent , but not outstanding team , as the Flames finished third in the Patrick for the following three seasons and typically won a few games more than they lost each year . The team qualified for the playoffs all three years , but lost in the preliminary round each time . In 1975 – 76 , they were defeated by the Los Angeles Kings in a best of three series 2 games to 0 . The Kings again eliminated the Flames in 1976 – 77 , but Atlanta earned its first playoff victory in franchise history in the second game of the series . Vail scored the game @-@ winning goal in a 3 – 2 victory over the Kings on April 7 , 1977 , but the Flames were eliminated in the third game . 1975 draft pick Willi Plett emerged as a young star for the Flames . He scored 33 goals in his rookie season of 1976 – 77 and won the Calder Trophy . 
 Seeking to improve his team 's fortunes , Fletcher made several moves over the following seasons to rework the Flames roster . His goaltending tandem of Bouchard and Myre had begun to feud with each other by the 1977 – 78 season as both sought more playing time . Fletcher responded by naming Bouchard his number one goaltender and trading Myre to the St. Louis Blues for three players . They made it into the playoffs again but were the only team to fall to a team with fewer points than them , the Detroit Red Wings , in a best @-@ of @-@ three series , 2 games to 0 . In March 1979 , Fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise @-@ leading scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players , led by defenseman Phil Russell . Fletcher hoped that the addition of Russell would help his team achieve playoff success . 
 Buoyed by a franchise record ten @-@ game winning streak in October 1978 , the 1978 – 79 Flames posted the best record in their Atlanta years at 41 – 31 – 8 . Bob MacMillan , acquired in the Myre deal , became the first Flame other than Lysiak to lead the team in scoring in six years and , along with Guy Chouinard , was one of the first two Flames ' players to score 100 points in one season . Chouinard also became the team 's first 50 @-@ goal scorer . MacMillan won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season as the NHL 's most gentlemanly player . In the playoffs against the Toronto Maple Leafs , Atlanta again failed to win a game as they lost a best of three series 2 games to 0 . 
 Fletcher continued to alter his team 's make @-@ up throughout the 1979 – 80 . Al MacNeil replaced Creighton as head coach prior to the season , and the team acquired Swedish star Kent Nilsson following the demise of the WHA . Nilsson led Atlanta in scoring with 40 goals and 53 assists . At the 1979 NHL Entry Draft , Fletcher selected four players – Paul Reinhart , Jim Peplinski , Pat <unk> and Tim Hunter – who would ultimately become regulars in the Flames line up . However , while the Flames again qualified for the playoffs in 1980 , they again lost in the first round , losing a best @-@ of @-@ five series to the New York Rangers three games to one . 
 = = = Relocation = = = 
 As the team stagnated on the ice , the Flames struggled at the gate . They peaked at an average of 14 @,@ 161 fans per game in their second season , 1973 – 74 , but fell to 12 @,@ 258 three years later and then 10 @,@ 500 in 1977 – 78 . Concerns that low attendance could result in the relocation of the team surfaced by 1976 , prompting politicians and the players themselves to purchase tickets in a bid to stabilize the franchise . The Flames attempted to boost attendance in 1980 by signing Jim Craig , goaltender of the American Olympic team that had won the Olympic gold medal following its " Miracle on Ice " victory over the Soviet Union . It was not successful as attendance fell to an average of 10 @,@ 024 . Adding to the Flames ' financial woes was the fact that the Omni Coliseum was built without revenue @-@ generating luxury suites , among the last major arenas in North America to be built without them , which led Fletcher to describe the facility as being " out @-@ of @-@ date when it opened " . 
 Cousins announced that he was seeking to sell the club following the Flames ' exit from the playoffs ; Their final game , a 5 – 2 loss , was played in Atlanta on April 12 , 1980 . He claimed to have suffered significant financial losses on the team while low viewership hampered his ability to sign a television contract for the team . The team , estimated to have lost $ 12 million in its eight years , had been rumored for months to be moving to Calgary , though Dallas and Houston were also mentioned as possible destinations . 
 The Seaman brothers , Daryl and Byron , had made an offer of $ 14 million while the City of Calgary prepared to build a new arena for the team . However , Canadian businessman Nelson Skalbania emerged as a rival bidder for the team before joining the Calgary consortium . The group agreed to purchase the Flames for $ 16 million , at the time the highest price ever paid for a National Hockey League team . The sale was announced on May 21 , 1980 , and the franchise relocated to Canada where it became the Calgary Flames . The Flames have since used the Atlanta logo for both its alternate captains , and the team 's former affiliate that played in the American Hockey League , the Adirondack Flames . 
 The last active Atlanta Flames player in the NHL was Kent Nilsson , who played his final game in 1995 . Several former players of the team returned to Atlanta once their careers ended . Among them , Tom Lysiak operated a horse farm outside the city , Eric Vail returned to operate a nightclub , and Willi Plett operated a sporting theme park and golf course .

He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004 as a builder . 
 Patt Quinn played with the Atlanta Flames from 1972 to 1977 was inducted as a builder for coaching various teams around the league . The Flames first coach Bernie Geoffrion was also inducted into the player category in 1972 , the same year he joined the Flames organization .

 = Sour Milk Sea = 
 " Sour Milk Sea " is a song by the English rock singer Jackie Lomax that was released as his debut single on the Beatles ' Apple record label in August 1968 . It was written by George Harrison during the Beatles ' stay in Rishikesh , India , and given to Lomax to help launch Apple Records . The song 's recording was the first of many extracurricular musical projects undertaken by Harrison , who produced the track , and a rarity among non @-@ Beatles songs since it features contributions from three members of the band . Along with Harrison , Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney , the musicians on the track were Eric Clapton and session pianist Nicky Hopkins . 
 Harrison wrote " Sour Milk Sea " to promote Transcendental Meditation , which the Beatles had been studying in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . The group recorded a demo of the song while considering material for their 1968 double album , The Beatles . On release , Lomax 's single was overshadowed in Apple 's " Our First Four " promotional campaign by the Beatles ' " Hey Jude " and Mary Hopkin 's " Those Were the Days " ; it enjoyed only minor success internationally , becoming a top 30 hit in Canada . Together with its B @-@ side , the Lomax @-@ written " The Eagle Laughs at You " , the song was included on the singer 's only Apple album , Is This What You Want ? , released in March 1969 . 
 " Sour Milk Sea " has received praise from many music critics . Writing for Mojo shortly after Lomax 's death in 2013 , Danny Eccleston described it as " a brilliantly excitable recording " , although he attributed the single 's lack of commercial success to an " accusatory tone " in Harrison 's lyrics . The track also appears on the 2010 multi @-@ artist compilation Come and Get It : The Best of Apple Records . 
 = = Background and inspiration = = 
 " Sour Milk Sea " was one of several songs that George Harrison wrote while staying at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi 's ashram in Rishikesh , India , from February to April 1968 . Having first visited India in September 1966 , following the Beatles ' final concert tour , Harrison became enamoured with the teachings of the Maharishi and led his Beatles bandmates to Rishikesh to study Transcendental Meditation two years later . With Life magazine labelling 1968 " the Year of the Guru " , the Beatles ' visit generated wide interest in Transcendental Meditation , and Eastern spirituality generally , among Western youth . Author Simon Leng writes that with " Sour Milk Sea " , Harrison adopted " the role of advertising executive " to further promote meditation . Leng views it as a follow @-@ up to " Within You Without You " , in which Harrison had first channelled the teachings of the Hindu Vedas into a song . 
 In his autobiography , I , Me , Mine , Harrison says that " Sour Milk Sea " espouses meditation as a means to improve the quality of one 's life , as well as advocating a proactive approach when faced with difficulty . He says he named the composition after a picture titled <unk> Samudra , which reflects the theme of <unk> Tantra in sacred Hindu texts , particularly regarding " the geological theory of the evolution of organic life on earth " . Singer Jackie Lomax , whose debut solo album Harrison had agreed to produce before the Beatles departed for India , said that the Sour Milk Sea symbolises " a fallow period " during each of the Earth 's 26 @,@ 000 @-@ year evolutionary cycles , before the planet begins its process of regeneration . 
 = = Composition = = 
 As with the other songs he wrote in Rishikesh , " Sour Milk Sea " marked the start of Harrison 's return to the guitar as his main instrument , coinciding with a gradual relinquishing of his attempts to master the Indian sitar . Referring to the compositional draft for " Sour Milk Sea " , musicologist Walter Everett states that together the various chords suggest " a pentatonic minor scale on A , allowing B ♭ as a tritone @-@ related ornament to E7 " . The song makes limited use of the expected A major chord , however , instead centring on E over the verses and D in the choruses , with the latter representing what Everett terms " the Mixolydian ♭ VII area " . Described by author and critic Richie Unterberger as a melody filled with " tense chord ascensions " , the composition shares its melodic characteristics with " Savoy Truffle " , another Harrison song from 1968 . 
 In the lyrics to the verses , Harrison focuses on the benefits of Transcendental Meditation rather than detailing the way to achieve these results . While Leng likens Harrison 's approach to that of an advertiser selling anti @-@ dandruff shampoo , author Joshua Greene describes the lyrical thrust of the song as : " Is life getting you down ? Not getting the breaks you want ? Try illumination . " Harrison proffers greater awareness and a release from earthly limitations as the other benefits brought about by the meditation experience . 
 According to theologian Dale Allison , through its promise of a quick solution , the song pre @-@ <unk> the concept espoused by John Lennon two years later in " Instant Karma ! " Harrison urges the listener to follow a " very simple process " and to " do it soon " , in order to leave the Sour Milk Sea state of mind and " Get back to where you should be " . Author Ian Inglis views the chorus lyrics as particularly forthright ; he paraphrases the message as " admit your shortcomings , pull yourself together , look for a solution " . 
 Although it originated as an acoustic guitar song , the official recording of " Sour Milk Sea " is in the heavy rock style typical of the late 1960s . Greene comments on the appropriateness of this " hard @-@ driving , blues guitar medium " as a way for Harrison to directly convey " a simple rule of thumb " regarding the human condition . 
 = = The Beatles ' demo = = 
 The Beatles recorded a demo of " Sour Milk Sea " at Harrison 's Esher home , Kinfauns , in May 1968 , while preparing material for their self @-@ titled double album , also known as " the White Album " . The demo was taped on Harrison 's Ampex four @-@ track recorder . The performance features Harrison singing falsetto throughout , and a musical backing that includes guitars and percussion . Although the subsequent album sessions were marked by disharmony and a lack of cooperation among the band members , author and critic Kenneth Womack notes that the Kinfauns demos " witness the Beatles working in unison and exalting in the pure joy of their music " . Leng similarly describes the group 's performance of " Sour Milk Sea " as an " exciting " version " [ p ] <unk> with real enthusiasm " . The recording has appeared on bootleg albums , including Acoustic Masterpieces ( The Esher Demos ) . 
 As with several of the songs previewed at Kinfauns , the Beatles did not revisit " Sour Milk Sea " during the White Album sessions . Harrison decided to give the song to former Undertakers singer Jackie Lomax – a fellow Liverpudlian and one of the first artists signed to the Beatles ' record label , Apple Records , in early 1968 . In a 2004 interview , Lomax said that he was fortunate to have Harrison 's help , adding : " even on a big project like The White Album he only had four songs . I think he was feeling held back [ in the Beatles ] . " 
 = = Recording = = 
 <unk> Harrison as his producer , Lomax recorded " Sour Milk Sea " for release as a single . The sessions for the song began at EMI 's Abbey Road Studios in London on 24 June 1968 , before moving to Trident Studios , to use that facility 's superior , eight @-@ track recording equipment . Speaking to Melody Maker in September that year , Harrison described the recording as a " glorified jam session " . The line @-@ up consisted of Lomax on vocals , Harrison and Eric Clapton on guitars , Nicky Hopkins on piano , Paul McCartney on bass , and Ringo Starr on drums . McCartney was absent from the initial session , however , only returning on 25 June from an Apple @-@ related business trip to California . While Apple projects typically featured one member of the Beatles , " Sour Milk Sea " is the only track where more than two members of the band appeared on another artist 's recording . 
 Clapton 's electric guitar playing gave the song a riff @-@ based quality that was absent from the Beatles ' version . Lomax later said that he thought the track " worked as an instrumental " , and he recalled his nervousness when it came to overdubbing the vocal part , with " three Beatles in the control room watching me " . In addition to supplying acoustic rhythm guitar on the song , Harrison played an electric guitar solo , which appears shortly after the two @-@ minute mark on the recording , following Clapton 's lead guitar break . Hammond organ was also added over this instrumental passage , although the part is uncredited . Recording was completed on 26 June . Like Clapton and Hopkins , Lomax went on to contribute to the sessions for The Beatles , singing backing vocals on " Dear Prudence " . 
 Leng identifies " Sour Milk Sea " as marking three important " firsts " in Harrison 's career . It was the first song Harrison " gave away " to another artist , a sign that his output as a songwriter had outgrown the quota of tracks typically allocated to him on Beatles releases . The Lomax album project also marked the first time that Harrison served as producer for another artist , after he had produced sessions in London and Bombay for his own debut solo album , Wonderwall Music . In addition , although Clapton had contributed to Wonderwall Music earlier in the year , " Sour Milk Sea " is the first example of him and Harrison sharing the lead guitarist 's role on a recording . Later in 1968 , the pair co @-@ wrote Cream 's final hit single , " Badge " , while their guitar combination would be a feature through much of Harrison 's solo career , as well as on Derek and the Dominos ' first single , " Tell the Truth " . 
 = = = " The Eagle Laughs at You " = = = 
 For the single 's B @-@ side , Lomax recorded his composition " The Eagle Laughs at You " . Produced by Harrison , the song was also recorded between 24 and 26 June . According to Apple Records historian Andy Davis , the musicians on the track comprised an " ad hoc power trio " of Lomax on bass and rhythm guitar , Harrison on lead guitar and " a couple of overdubs " , and drummer Tony Newman from Sounds Incorporated . Lomax recalled that he and Harrison overdubbed a cornet part ( played by a studio cleaner ) and then manipulated the recording to make it sound like the call of an elephant . 
 = = Release = = 
 The " Sour Milk Sea " single was issued on 26 August 1968 in America ( as Apple 1802 ) and 6 September in Britain ( as Apple 3 ) . Along with " Hey Jude " by the Beatles , Mary Hopkin 's " Those Were the Days " and the Black Dyke Mills Band 's " Thingumybob " , it was one of Apple 's " Our First Four " singles , marking the official launch of the label . The four releases took place on the same day in the United States but were spread out over two weeks in the UK . Apple staged a lavish promotional campaign for the launch , led by Derek Taylor , whom Harrison had invited to help run the Beatles ' new enterprise . In advance of the release date , the company declared 11 – 18 August to be " National Apple Week " and sent gift @-@ wrapped boxes of the four records to Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family , and to the British prime minister . 
 Although Lomax 's single received considerable promotion , it was a surprising commercial failure . " Sour Milk Sea " did not chart in Britain . In America , the song reached number 117 during a two @-@ week run on the Bubbling Under listings of Billboard 's Hot 100 chart , and " The Eagle Laughs at You " placed at number 125 . " Sour Milk Sea " was a hit in Canada , however , peaking at number 29 on the RPM 100 in November 1968 . In a 1974 feature on his career in ZigZag magazine , Lomax said that the song 's release in tandem with " obvious " hits like " Hey Jude " and " Those Were the Days " jinxed its commercial performance , since radio stations were reluctant to risk alienating other record labels by featuring all four Apple singles too heavily on their playlists . Lomax added : " So they kind of lost me in the shuffle . " 
 Both sides of the single were included on Lomax 's only album for Apple , Is This What You Want ? , released in March 1969 . The album similarly failed to achieve commercial success , a result that perplexed the Beatles , who continued to believe in Lomax 's talents . Due to the song 's strong association with the Beatles and Eric Clapton , " Sour Milk Sea " retained a degree of renown among rock music fans ; Danny Eccleston of Mojo magazine later described it as a " cult rendering " . In 1970 , Sour Milk Sea , one of singer Freddie Mercury 's pre @-@ Queen bands , was named after the track . In June the following year , Apple re @-@ released " Sour Milk Sea " with " Fall Inside Your Eyes " on the B @-@ side , but this single also failed to chart . 
 In 2010 , Apple reissued Is This What You Want ? as both an individual release and as part of the seventeen @-@ disc box set titled The Apple Box . " Sour Milk Sea " also appeared on the accompanying two @-@ CD compilation , Come and Get It : The Best of Apple Records . In conjunction with these releases , a mono mix of the song was made available for digital download . 
 = = Critical reception and legacy = = 
 On release in 1968 , the single received favourable reviews from music critics . Writing for Rolling Stone in 1971 , Ben Edmonds described " Sour Milk Sea " as " excellent " but suggested that Lomax " seemed to get lost among the superstars " accompanying him . Three years later , Andy Childs of ZigZag admired it as " a classic single – a really dynamic rock song with Lomax in great voice " . 
 Among Beatles biographers , Bruce Spizer attributes the commercial failure of Lomax 's " great rock single " to the simultaneous release of " Hey Jude " and " Those Were the Days " , while John Winn describes it as an " excellent debut " and " an inexplicable flop " . Simon Leng opines that the song " just wasn 't catchy enough " in Lomax 's reading and views the Beatles ' " garage rendition " as superior . Although he finds the musical arrangement and Lomax 's singing slightly incongruous beside Harrison 's philosophical lyrics , Ian Inglis recognises the track as " an early prototype of heavy metal , particularly in the interplay between drums and lead guitar and its relentless sequence of musical climaxes " . 
 Writing in Goldmine magazine in 2002 , Dave Thompson included " Sour Milk Sea " and " Badge " in his list of the Harrison @-@ written songs that " rank among the finest Beatles compositions of the group 's final years " , and he concluded : " the only regret is that neither of the latter two ever made it into a Beatles recording session . " In his book on the making of the White Album , Uncut critic David Quantick describes the song as " excellent " and rues how , together with Harrison 's " Not Guilty " , it was passed over in favour of " old toot such as ' Rocky Raccoon ' and ' Bungalow Bill ' " . Less impressed with the track , Richie Unterberger finds the lyrics " a blend of encouragement and mild scolding " , while rating it " a serviceable hard @-@ rock number with a bluesy boogie feel " next to the " considerably superior " " Savoy Truffle " . In his online article for Mojo published shortly after Lomax 's death in September 2013 , Danny Eccleston described " Sour Milk Sea " as " a brilliantly excitable recording " , although he attributed the song 's lack of success to an " accusatory tone " in Harrison 's lyrics . 
 In his preview of Apple 's 2010 reissues , for Rolling Stone , David Fricke listed Is This What You Want ? third among the label 's top five non @-@ Beatle album releases and praised " Sour Milk Sea " as , variously , a " get @-@ off @-@ your @-@ ass rocker " and " dynamite " . Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot considered it to be " a knockout version " . Among reviews of the Come and Get It compilation , Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media opined that " Sour Milk Sea " " would 've been one of the best songs on [ the White Album ] if George had kept it for himself " , while Uncut 's David Cavanagh described the track as " sensational " . AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls the song " a dense , brilliant , and soulful psychedelic rocker " . In his liner notes to the compilation , Andy Davis , formerly the editor of Record Collector magazine , highlights " Sour Milk Sea " as " the greatest record The Beatles never made " .

 = Chlamys hastata = 
 Chlamys hastata , the spear scallop , spiny scallop or swimming scallop , is a species of bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae found on the west coast of North America from the Gulf of Alaska to San Diego , California . A limited number of these scallops are harvested by divers or by narrow trawls off the west coast of Canada . 
 The spiny scallop lives on the seabed in the sublittoral zone between low tide mark and a depth of 150 metres ( 490 ft ) , on soft sediment or on rock , particularly in areas with a strong current . It is a filter feeder , sieving microscopic algae from water that passes though its gills . It is preyed on by starfish , octopuses and sea otters . It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves . Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The scientific name is derived from chlamys , the Latin word for a Greek cloak or short cape made of wool and worn by a soldier , and hastata meaning " spear @-@ like " from the Latin hasta , a spear or javelin . 
 = = Description = = 
 The shell of the spiny scallop is slightly shaped like a fan and is able to grow to a height of about 9 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) though a more normal adult size is 6 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) . The shell is composed of two valves , each of which is convex and has a small number of broad ribs covered with blunt spines . These radiate from the umbone , the rounded protuberance near the hinge , and between them are fine etched striations . The background colour is white with radial bands of pale purple and the right valve , which is usually underneath , is paler than the left . The annual growth rings are visible , often as concentric bands of a different hue . Beside the hinge are two irregular shell flaps or auricles with the anterior one normally being much larger than the other . This provides an attachment for the single strong adductor muscle that closes the shell . On either side of the long hinge there are some little ridges and grooves known as teeth . Their function is to prevent the valves moving sideways with regard to each other . Some bivalve shells have large " cardinal " teeth on the hinge immediately below the umbone , but the spiny scallop does not . Instead it has 5 or 6 lateral teeth lying on either side of the hinge . Lining the inside of the valves is the mantle , a membrane that covers the gut and other internal organs . It can be seen round the margins of the valves as a thick layer like a sandwich filling . It is fringed with numerous short tentacles and there is a row of tiny simple eyes close to each of the valves . The animal usually lies on its right valve and its exposed , left valve often has a colonial sponge growing on it . 
 The spiny scallop can be distinguished from its close relative the Pacific pink scallop ( Chlamys rubida ) by the valves being less rounded and by the small curved spines on the ribs which give it a rough texture whereas the Pacific pink feels smooth . The glossy white interior of the spiny scallop 's shell often has a purplish blotch near the umbone , not present in the Pacific pink . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The spiny scallop occurs naturally on the west coast of North America . Its range extends from the Gulf of Alaska to San Diego in southern California . It is found on the seabed in areas of sand , gravel or crushed shell and among boulders to a depth of about 150 metres ( 490 ft ) . It is also known from seagrass meadows and rocky shores and favours locations with high currents . 
 = = Biology = = 
 The spiny scallop anchors itself to the substrate with a few byssus threads . It is unclear what the purpose of these is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding . Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway . They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim . It is a filter feeder . It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action . A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight . <unk> are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves . Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps ( mouth appendages ) , before being ingested . Rejected particles are formed into mucous @-@ wrapped blobs . These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves . When the gonads are ripening , a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development . At this time , glycogen storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads . 
 When the spiny scallop 's valves are parted for feeding and respiration , many tentacles protrude from each edge of the mantle . The longer ones have sensitive chemoreceptor cells at their tip which can taste the water and allow the mollusc to react appropriately to , for example , the " smell " of a starfish , by taking evasive action . The shorter ones , forming a ring all the way round the edge of the mantle , have simple eyes at their tips . Each eye contains a lens , two retinas and a concave spherical mirror . The eyes cannot see objects but can detect the difference between light and darkness , enabling the valves to be snapped shut if some large , threatening object looms nearby . They also seem to be able to detect the size and speed of particles moving past the bivalve in the current , enabling it to open its valves wide to feed when conditions are suitable . 
 Spiny scallops are dioecious , individuals being either male or female . They become mature at about 2 years old and usually live for about 4 years . Breeding takes place in the summer . <unk> are released into the water column and fertilisation is external . <unk> larvae begin to develop from the eggs in about 2 days and drift with the plankton for 40 days , growing to a maximum valve length of <unk> ( 0 @.@ 01 inch ) . The larvae have a tuft of broad , compound cilia near the mouth . The velum , the locomotory and feeding organ , has bands of cilia running down it . The simple eyes and rudimentary gills start developing on about the 25th day . The foot becomes visible on the 15th day and the <unk> ( the projecting front end of the foot ) develops on about the 28th . By the <unk> day , the larva is crawling about using its foot and its cilia . Metamorphosis takes place on about the 40th day . Over the course of 48 hours , the internal organs undergo a 90 ° rotation , the valves , hinge and ligament appear and the gills lengthen . A swimming veliger larva has become a benthic juvenile scallop .

 Animals that feed on the spiny scallop include starfish , particularly the ochre star ( Pisaster ochraceus ) and the sunflower star ( <unk> <unk> ) , octopuses and sea otters . The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators , repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action . Each time the valves close , water is expelled through a gap in the mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first , a form of jet propulsion . It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action . It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges , such as nudibranchs of the genus <unk> spp .. 
 The spiny scallop usually has a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve . This is most often the orange <unk> <unk> but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale <unk> . The sponge provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful . It also makes it more difficult for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet that it needs to force the two valves of the scallop apart . The sponge benefits from the fact that living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment . In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity . A laboratory study showed that , in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up , sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished . However , another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones . 
 Other organisms also grow on the scallop 's shell . The boring sponge <unk> <unk> is a parasitic species which makes holes up to 1 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 059 in ) diameter in the valve . Other common epibionts living on the surface of the valve include tube worms , barnacles and bryozoans . In a survey undertaken off San Juan Islands , Washington , 144 scallops , C. hastata and C. rubida were dredged up , mostly from a depth of 90 metres ( 300 ft ) . The right valve was much more heavily colonised than the left with 76 % clad with epibionts as against 17 % of the left valves . The encrusting sponges ( mostly Mycale <unk> ) were common as were the barnacle ( Balanus rostratus ) and the tube worms <unk> <unk> , <unk> vermicularis and <unk> sp . Also encountered were other bivalves , bryozoans , brachiopods and tunicates . Many of the tubes made by the worms were unoccupied and other organisms <unk> living and dead calcareous tubes . On the lower , left valve , <unk> and <unk> bryozoans predominated . Starfish seem equally able to force open the valves of a scallop with barnacles on it as one with none . 
 Barnacles are normally sessile animals unable to evade predators . When they are attached to a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation . The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim . It has been found that encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby . The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges . This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles . 
 = = Fishery = = 
 Some harvesting of scallops under exploratory fishing licences is done off the west coast of Canada , though a previous commercial scallop fishery has been discontinued . Methods used are diving and small trawls with a maximum width of 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) . Minimum size limits are set for the height of the shells , 80 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) for the spiny scallop and 71 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) for the pink scallop . A framework research document was published by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in 2000 which made recommendations on the development of the dive and trawl fisheries . 
 = Cynicism ( philosophy ) = 
 Cynicism ( Greek : <unk> ) is a school of Ancient Greek philosophy as practiced by the Cynics ( Greek : <unk> , Latin : <unk> ) . For the Cynics , the purpose of life was to live in virtue , in agreement with nature . As reasoning creatures , people could gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for themselves , rejecting all conventional desires for wealth , power , sex and fame . Instead , they were to lead a simple life free from all possessions . 
 The first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes , who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC . He was followed by Diogenes of Sinope , who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens . Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes , and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher . He was followed by Crates of Thebes who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens . Cynicism spread with the rise of Imperial Rome in the 1st century , and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire . It finally disappeared in the late 5th century , although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity . 
 By the 19th century , emphasis on the negative aspects of Cynic philosophy led to the modern understanding of cynicism to mean a disposition of disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions . 
 = = Origin of the Cynic name = = 
 The name Cynic derives from Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " dog @-@ like " , and κύων ( <unk> ) , meaning " dog " ( genitive : <unk> ) . One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called " dogs " was because the first Cynic , Antisthenes , taught in the Cynosarges gymnasium at Athens . The word <unk> means the " place of the white dog " . It seems certain , however , that the word dog was also thrown at the first Cynics as an insult for their shameless rejection of conventional manners , and their decision to live on the streets . Diogenes , in particular , was referred to as the " Dog " , a distinction he seems to have revelled in , stating that " other dogs bite their enemies , I bite my friends to save them . " Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage , as a later commentator explained : 
 There are four reasons why the Cynics are so named . First because of the indifference of their way of life , for they make a cult of indifference and , like dogs , eat and make love in public , go barefoot , and sleep in tubs and at crossroads . The second reason is that the dog is a shameless animal , and they make a cult of shamelessness , not as being beneath modesty , but as superior to it . The third reason is that the dog is a good guard , and they guard the tenets of their philosophy . The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies . So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy , and receive them kindly , while those unfitted they drive away , like dogs , by barking at them .
