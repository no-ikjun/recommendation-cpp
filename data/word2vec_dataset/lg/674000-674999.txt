 According to Francis Buchanan , 15 @,@ 000 of them returned to Mangalore and its environs , whilst 10 @,@ 000 of them migrated to Malabar . The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency ( 1883 ) mentions that 15 @,@ 000 persons returned , of whom 12 @,@ 000 were from South Canara and 3 @,@ 000 from North Canara . According to the Mangalorean Catholic genealogist Michael Lobo , the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely from the small group of survivors who returned to South Canara . Soon after the death of Tipu , a detachment from the Bombay army under Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Wiseman took possession of Mangalore on 4 June 1799 , as well as the entire province of Canara , with the exception of the fortress of Jamalabad . 
 Thomas Munro was appointed the first collector of Canara in June 1799 and remained in the post until October 1800 . He was accompanied by officers John Goldsborough Ravenshaw and Alexander Reade who were to take control and reorganise the administration . Munro issued three edicts regarding Christian estates that had been taken over by non @-@ Christians during the captivity . In determining ownership of land , he sent two Mangalorean Hindus , <unk> <unk> and Saly <unk> Dur Shetty along with other Christians to investigate and report back to him about these estates . Through the assistance of the Church , and with the support of Munro , the Christians were able to recover their lands and estates . 
 In 1800 , the British took a census of the region . Of the 396 @,@ 672 people living in South Canara , 10 @,@ 877 were Christians residing in 2 @,@ 545 houses . According to the same census , in the entire province of Canara , out of the 592 @,@ 000 people , the Christian population was recorded as 10 @,@ 877 in South Canara , and 2 @,@ 380 in North Canara . Padre José Miguel Luis de Mendes , a Goan Catholic priest , was appointed Vicar of Our Lady of Rosary at Mangalore on 7 December 1799 . He took a lot of interest in the re @-@ establishment of the community from 1799 to 1808 . Later , John Goldsborough Ravenshaw was appointed collector of South Canara , whilst Alexander Reade became collector of North Canara . Ravenshaw took an active part in the re @-@ establishment of their former possessions and recovery of their estates . He constructed a church for them , which was completed in 1806 . Churches destroyed by Tipu were rebuilt by the Christians . 
 After relocation , the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Goa recommenced . The Christian population almost doubled in 1818 when their total in North and South Canara was estimated to be 21 @,@ 280 out of a total population of 670 @,@ 355 . According to various parish books dating to the time , Mangalorean Catholics numbered 19 @,@ 068 in South Canara ( 12 @,@ 877 in Mangalore and Bantval , 3 @,@ 918 in Moolki , 2 @,@ 273 in Cundapore and Barcoor ) , whilst Christians in North Canara numbered 2 @,@ 749 ( 1 @,@ 878 in Onore , 599 in Ancola , and 272 in <unk> ) . Before long the Mangalorean Catholics became a prosperous and influential community consisting mainly of planters , tile manufacturers , and agriculturists . They also competed with the local Brahmins for offices in the services of the British , under whose rule the community prospered . 
 = = Criticism of Tipu = = 
 Many Roman Catholic and British writers have severely criticised Tipu for his policies and treatment of Christians . British general Kirkpatrick referred to Tipu as , " the intolerant bigot and the furious fanatic . " British Colonel Mark Wilks in his Historical Sketches of the South of India , cites an account in which Tipu mentions that , " the cause arose from the rage of Islam began to boil in his breast when informed of the circumstances of the spread of Christianity in Goa and Canara . " 
 According to historian Thomas Paul , Tipu shifted his hatred for the British to the Mangalorean Catholics and other South Indian Christian communities . Sita Ram Goel mentions that Tipu 's justification for the conversion was that during the Portuguese domination , many Muslims were forcibly converted to Christianity . Tipu proclaimed his actions as a punishment for the conversion of Muslims to Christianity . 
 According to historian Alan Machado Prabhu , Tipu 's reasons for the captivity were primarily religious . He found the social customs of the Christians distasteful , such as their fondness for pork and the social acceptance of alcohol . Tipu therefore saw them as a community deserving of his religious zeal as a <unk> . As evidence of this , Prabhu states that Tipu does not mention a large scale Christian conspiracy in his writings in the Sultan @-@ ul @-@ Tawarikh , where he justifies his action instead as arising from the " rage of Islam that began to boil in his breast . " 
 Prabhu further asserts that Tipu 's hatred of Christians was compounded by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co @-@ religionists , the Christians were viewed as a potential fifth column in the event of a British attack . To this , he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain . Therefore , according to Prabhu , through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics , Tipu fabricated evidence of a large @-@ scale Christian conspiracy against him , even though he knew it wasn 't true . 
 Contemporary scholars like <unk> Sen , <unk> Hasan , N. K. Sinha , and B. Sheik Ali , who have analysed Tipu 's religious policies on Christians , conclude that he was not a religious bigot . They argue that forcible conversions to Islam were done purely for political , not religious reasons . Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment for Christians who supported the British against their own native suzerain . The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu . 
 Irrespective of these views , the Mangalorean Catholic community still considers Tipu as a bitter religious bigot and a ferocious <unk> . He remains a hated personality among the community . More than a century after the Captivity ended , Jerome Saldanha , a Mangalorean Catholic historian and civil servant during the British Raj at the Bombay Presidency , wrote an article in Mangalore Magazine , published by St. Aloysius College , which chronicled contemporary developments and views from the closing decades of the 19th century : 
 " People of all classes belonging to Canara , especially the Christians , had suffered so dreadfully from Tipu 's regime of terror that they welcomed the British with a sense of relief and joy , and a hope of future peace and prosperity , that perhaps nowhere else was felt in India on the advent of the British . Nor were our ancestors disappointed , for they found that the main object of British rule in India was to secure the happiness of the people over whom it was held . " 
 = = Criticism of the Christians = = 
 Thirty years after the event the apparent lack of resistance from the Christian captives drew criticism from the French priest Abbe Dubois . In one of his letters dated 1815 , Dubois commented , " not a single individual among so many thousands had courage enough to confess his faith under this trying circumstance , and become a martyr to his religion . " Various writers have concluded that the acceptance and practise of Islam by the Christians amounted to partial apostasy . 
 = = Remembrance of captivity = = 
 During the mid @-@ 19th century , Victor Fernandes , Bishop of Mangalore ( 1931 – 1955 ) , erected a large cross on the former outskirts of Mangalore in Nanthoor near the <unk> hills in honour of the memory of those Mangalorean Catholics who died on the march to Seringapatam during the Captivity . The bicentenary of the release from captivity was widely celebrated on 4 May 1999 by the Mangalorean Catholic community . Five Catholics walked from Seringapatam to Mangalore to retrace the 278 @-@ kilometre ( 173 mi ) route that Tipu Sultan forced the Christians to follow in 1784 . The commemorative march ended on 11 May at the Rosario Cathedral , Mangalore .

 God Almighty hath said : — " And he caused such of those who have received tho Scriptures , and assisted the confederates , to come down out of their fortresses , and he cast into their hearts terror and dismay : a part of them you slew , and a part you made captives ; and God caused you to inherit their land , and their houses , and their wealth , and a land on which you had not trodden ; for God is Almighty . " After the flight of the infidels it was ordered that war should be continued with the Bani <unk> , ^ as they had assisted the confederates , breaking their league with the Muslims . The Muslim army besieged them for fifteen days and nights and reduced them to distress . They came down at the order given them by Saad bin <unk> , who adjudged that the males should be put to the sword , the women and children made slaves , and their goods divided among the Muslims . The Prophet ( the blessing and peace of God be on him ! ) addressing Saad , said , " 0 Saad <unk> — you have pronounced that which the Most High had ordered above the seven skies . " God refers to this event when He says that He brought them out of their fortresses as they had assisted the confederates and protected them . These were believers in the Old Testament , namely , Jews . God cast into their hearts terror of the Prophet and his army , and those who were killed numbered between seven and nine hundred , and their women and children were made slaves . You inherited their land , gardens , fields and houses , their fortified places , and their property consisting of money and cattle . All these were given you by God . And this saying likewise applies to the <unk> , to Turkey , or to Persia .

 = Double burden = 
 Double burden is a term used to describe the workload of people who work to earn money , but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor . This phenomenon is also known as the The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild 's book of the same name . In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs , women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work , such as childrearing or caring for sick family members . This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time . Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work . 
 Efforts have been made to document the effects of this double burden on couples placed in such situations . Many studies have traced the effects of the gendered division of labor , and in most cases there was a notable difference between the time men and women contribute to unpaid labor . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The term double burden arises from the fact that many women , as well as some men , are responsible for both domestic labor and paid labor . However , due to the thinking that a woman 's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman 's time spent doing paid work , and that a man 's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man 's time spent doing domestic work , there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work , leading to the double burden . Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day , second shift , and double duty .

 = = = = Pre @-@ World War II = = = = 
 The traditional female homemaker – male breadwinner model characterized female employment prior to World War II . At the turn of the 20th century in the continental United States , only 18 percent of women over the age of 15 reported receiving income non @-@ farm employment . These women were typically young , single , white , and native @-@ born . In contrast , married women in the non @-@ farm labor force were " predominantly blacks or immigrants and very poor . " Working mothers often exited the labor force once their children were old enough to earn money . 
 The outpouring of occupational opportunities in the early 1920s , such as in " cafeterias , nurseries , laundries and other facilities seemed to release women from domestic chores and freed them to participate fully in the sphere of production . " 
 This migration of women into the workforce shook the traditional ideology of gender roles , but importantly , it was the catalyst to the double burden becoming noticeable . The 1930s " encouraged women to fulfill what Stalin termed the " great and honorable duty that nature has given " them . Evident in the Soviet Union , " an officially sponsored cult of motherhood , buttressed by anti @-@ abortion legislation " accompanied by a " depression of living standards " led to industry 's immense demand for laborers which got women into the industrial workforce in unprecedented numbers . " Urban women thus found themselves assuming the " double burden " ( also known as the " double shift " ) of waged work outside the home and the lion 's share of unpaid labor within it . " The Second World War is typically seen as a catalyst for increasing female employment . Best exemplified by Rosie the Riveter propaganda of an efficient , patriotic , woman worker , World War II increased demand for female labor to replace that of the " 16 million men mobilized to serve in the Armed Forces " . While a substantial number of women worked in war factories , the majority of jobs were in the service sector . This caused the gendered expectations for that time to be altered and roles to be both tested and reassigned for the incoming decades . 
 = = = = Post @-@ World War II = = = = 
 The post @-@ World War II period is marked by relatively high levels of female participation in the workforce , particularly in industrialized countries . Although a large proportion of women exited the workforce immediately following World War II , the idea of working class women was able to take root and normalize . " In 2001 , 47 percent of U.S. workers were women , and 61 percent of women over the age of 15 were in the labor force . " Besides an increased demand for women 's labor , other factors contributed to the growth of their participation , such as more educational opportunities and later marriage and childbearing ages . 
 The idea of the double burden is more evolved with the times concerning both sexes and their newfound roles . The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women , but as more women enter the workforce , an ' independent ' ideology seems to take effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family . Some may choose strictly one or the other , others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles . Some " modern men tend to believe in the principle of equal sharing of domestic labor , but fail to actually live up to that belief . " The constant tug of war regarding one 's time and where it could , should but will be spent creates a new speed bump that is a little bit higher than the previous ones . Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual @-@ income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment . The burden of encompassing both ideologies plays a toll on both sexes in today 's societies . 
 = = = South America = = = 
 Due to globalization in the past thirty years , the power of the unskilled worker has diminished , and thus , the informal economy has flourished . In Latin America , there is an abundant amount of workers to help out with domestic work , and consequently , domestic service is cheap , diminishing the family tensions surrounding the issue of domestic work . Currently , about half of the working population is employed in the informal sector , leading to " unemployment , underemployment , and social exclusion " . Because of this , there has been a serious delay in providing welfare for the care of children and the elderly , because the pressure to provide aid for working families is minimal . In addition , domestic workers , many of them women , often leave their countries to work in the informal sector in northern countries in order to increase income for their families , also delaying the pressure for governments to provide aid to these families . However , there has been a change since the 2000s in thinking about unpaid work due to the influx of paid jobs for women and the shortage of people available to do domestic work . 
 Although the increase in jobs for women has had benefits in policy changes for families with working parents , there has been debates about the conditions of the work places . In Mexico , there is an influx of the <unk> industry , which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations . The mostly female workforce is often exploited by having unsafe working conditions , and stress is a major cause of many illnesses of these women . 
 Another increasing issue is the rise in conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America , such as the <unk> program in Mexico . Although this program is meant to provide poor families with an increase in income , the <unk> has led to a time poverty for the family members who are in charge of fulfilling the conditions , most oftentimes the woman . This has increased the inequality of work burden within the family . 
 = = = Africa = = = 
 In Africa , the HIV / AIDS pandemic has been the major cause of falling life expectancy . There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care . One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV / AIDS affects working age people the most , and there has been evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers . Another reason is due to the influx of HIV / AIDS , government @-@ led health policies are breaking down , increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do . Because of the lack of care workers available , the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work , resulting in poorer quality of care . 
 Women in Africa also face different time struggles than women elsewhere , because of the need to perform domestic chores such as " collecting water and wood " , which takes away from their free time . 
 Another aspect of the double burden in Africa is that there is class divide , meaning that most white families , including poor ones , employ Africans either as a live @-@ in worker or a part @-@ time worker . In addition , because of the urban house shortage , oftentimes relatives and friends are given room and board in exchange for unpaid work , alleviating work for some . 
 = = = Western Europe = = = 
 Since the 1960s , Western Europe has been participating in a series of political debates to increase women ’ s rights in the workforce . In the 2000s , there has been a change from considering women ’ s rights to a mother ’ s rights , focusing on the rights of pregnant women as well as mothers . However , there have been issues with creating laws specifically for mothers . There is still the inherent gender bias that women are the ones to care for children . 
 Some parts of Western Europe , especially Scandinavian countries have been creating family friendly policies that have aided them in equalizing the gender difference in participation in the work force . Nordic countries have the highest female participation rates in the work force in the world and salary differences are among the lowest . Government aid in providing care to the elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia to be a part of the working population in nearly a high rate as men . Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re @-@ entry programs . Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce , as well as a higher birth rate , and a robust economy . 
 = = = Eastern Europe = = = 
 Under communism , everyone was guaranteed employment . However , women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work , leading to lower birth rates . The commitment to social equality and the issue of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights , such as child care and child allowances . For example , in the Soviet Union , maternity leave was extended to three years and part @-@ time work was introduced . With the collapse of communism , many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place . Although there has been an increase in female workers , their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met , and has been ignored . 
 = = = Asia = = = 
 In Western and Southern Asia , women represent only a third of the work force . Many of them , even women in more modernized Asian countries , are involved in the informal sector , in traditional jobs for women , such as caring or teaching , without benefits such as employee health insurance or pension plans . 
 The issue of the double burden is exacerbated in Asian countries due to the large cultural norm of women doing care work held by both men and women . In many developed countries , women drop out of work when they have children in order to have more time to take care of them . 
 In countries where women have to do paid work in order to feed their family , there is a lack of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available . In Thailand for example , due to the severe economic crisis in 1997 , many women have jobs in the informal industry , and often do home @-@ based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs . This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time , and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women 's health . 
 = = Causes of the double burden = = 
 = = = Gender ideology = = = 
 " Gender ideologies are linked to beliefs about appropriate behaviour for men and women " <unk> plays a major role in determining gender ideologies and what 's valued in one time and culture may not necessarily transcend to another . Traditional gender ideologies have contributed to the double burden because it posits women as caretakers , men as providers , and each gender occupying their own sphere of influence . Although research has shown that attitudes about gender roles have become more egalitarian over the past few decades , " these changes in gender attitudes have not been accompanied by corresponding changes in the allocation of housework " . 
 = = = Labor market constraints = = = 
 Despite women 's increasing participation in the work force , a gender division of labor persist . There are a number of constraints in the labor market that contribute to the double burden . " Women are disproportionately represented in informal work and concentrated among lower @-@ quality jobs within self @-@ employment . " The informal market is generally precarious and characterized by low wages , few benefits , and a lack of social protections that are offered in the formal market . Even within the formal market , there is occupational segregation and a gender wage gap . Occupational segregation can be either horizontal or vertical : horizontal segregation limits women to certain sectors and occupations , while vertical segregation restricts them to particular positions within occupational hierarchies . Men and women are even found at different levels of the occupational hierarchy . The " glass ceiling " is the relative absence of women in senior or managerial positions due to institutional barriers and norms . Even in female @-@ dominated occupations , men often occupy the more skilled and better paid positions . 
 The gender wage gap is a possible consequence of occupational segregation . The gender wage gap is the " difference between wages earned by women and men " . In 2008 , globally , men were estimated to earn 16 @.@ 5 per cent more than women . The gender wage gap is narrowing , but progress remains slow . Additionally , the narrowing of the gender wage gap may be attributed to a decrease in men 's wages instead of an increase in women 's wages . " The persistent gender wage gap across regions may reflect a number of factors , including women ’ s continued disadvantage in terms of education and skills ; their lack of an organized voice and bargaining power ; gender @-@ specific constraints on their labour market mobility ; and their relatively high involvement in part @-@ time or temporary jobs . " Many characteristics of the labor market constrain the employment opportunities of women and make it easier for them to be responsible for care work . 
 = = = Societal pressures = = = 
 There are various societal pressures that combine to create the double burden , including some economic thinking of domestic work , thoughts about net household gain , and the perceived notion that women are more likely to ask for maternity leave than men . Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation . They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive , and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers . There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor . This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs , creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled . In addition , women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men , meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job , which has negative effects on female employment . 
 = = = Political pressure = = = 
 One of the political pressures , it is suggested by Susan <unk> is the issue of whom to empower . When there are considerations of policies , politicians usually only consider work as paid labor , and do not take into account the interdependence between unpaid work and paid work . It is also often common to think that women make economic decisions similarly to men . This is typically not the case , because for men , payment is simply a compensation for lost leisure time . However , for women , when they are working in the paid sector , they are still losing money because they have to make provisions for the domestic labor they are unable to do , such as caring for children or making dinner from scratch due to lack of resources such as child care . Her net financial gain is less than the financial gain of a man because she has to spend her earnings on providing for these provisions . In addition , increasing paid work hours in order to have more money may have negative effects on the woman due to the increased total work hours and decreased leisure time . Therefore , policies that give greater power to people who do paid labor , such as cutting back on public expenditure in order to lessen income taxes have an adverse effect on female employment and the effect that the double burden has on females . Such policies give greater power and consideration towards people who work in the paid sector , and less towards people who work in the unpaid sector . 
 Another political issue surrounding the double burden is what sort of policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work . Some policies that companies have , such as a lower rate for part @-@ time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant can be seen as disempowering women . Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues . On one side , only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate amount of women who do part @-@ time work instead of full @-@ time , suggesting that there should be allowances made for women . However , there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract , women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate amount of benefits and given no exceptions over men . 
 = = = Separate notion of paid work vs. unpaid work = = = 
 As the term double burden might suggest , when people consider paid work vs. unpaid work , they often consider them as two separate entities - that the man or woman is doing one or the other , but not at the same time . In reality , men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously , creating the issue of work intensity , where the person undertakes many activities at the same time in order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day . Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time , and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning , or sewing while taking care of the children . Because of this , the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated . This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries . For example , many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day . 
 = = = Increased <unk> of family = = = 
 Due to the increasing trend of decreased fertility rate , there has been an increased <unk> of the family , where families have less immediate relatives to depend on in times of need . Because of this phenomenon , families do not have an extended family to depend on when they need a caretaker or someone to do domestic work , and must turn to market substitutes or a member of the immediate family doing both domestic and paid work instead .

 Many studies have been done to investigate the division of household labor within couples , and more specifically , on the gender roles played by a variety of people worldwide . According to The State of the World 's Children 2007 , women generally work longer hours than men regardless if they live in a developed or developing country . Most studies found that when both parents are faced with a full @-@ time job , women are faced with a higher amount of a domestic workload than men . According to the World Bank Latin American and Caribbean Studies , Mexican women in the labor force still spend approximately 33 hours each week performing household responsibilities . In contrast , husbands only contribute approximately 6 hours each week . Even more striking , " daughters contribute 14 hours weekly helping their mothers , while sons spend the same time as their fathers ( that is , 5 – 6 hours weekly ) . " In a study done by Statistics Canada 's General Social Survey of 10 @,@ 000 households , the average man spent under two hours a day dealing with childcare and house work while women on average spent a little more than three . This study highlights the unequal distribution of labor between partners . Of the people surveyed , under fifteen percent of the couples agreed on doing around the same amount of work in the house . About 83 percent of women participated in housecleaning and food preparation compared to only 51 percent of men who were surveyed . 
 John Frederick Conway 's book , The Canadian Family in Crisis , explores effects of the double burden by gender . In Conway 's studies , he discovers the physical , emotional , and psychological differences between men and women faced with the double burden in Canada . In these studies it was found that women who are raising children and are in the workforce are more prone to have anxiety and many other stress related effects than the women who are just faced with one of the two burdens . 
 = = = Men = = = 
 Even though the effects of raising children and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies , the men in such situations are affected greatly as well . This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility . In The Canadian Family in Crisis , the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys . This is because women 's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men 's stress , in most cases , mostly come from decision making and work @-@ family conflicts . These situations arise where the male must make the best choice for the future of his family . Specifically , these include things such as workload , overtime hours , shift decisions , and even accepting a promotion or a transfer . In these situations , the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family , which brings on more stress . The effects also go unnoticed since , in traditional gender roles , the male is supposed to be the backbone of the family and , in the past , it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family . In surveys and studies done , most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household , which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family . With this in mind , it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics .

 Parenting is a large task within itself , and when a parent has a career as well , it can cause a double burden , or work – family conflict . Strain begins to develop when women and men find that the demands of their family are conflicting with the demands from their job . When one is faced with a double burden like this , it affects how decisions are made within a career and in a family ; this burden could potentially effect when a couple decides to have children . 75 % of all women who have jobs are in their childbearing prime . When the conflict between one 's family and work presents itself , the unpaid work that is being done in the home may be cut down , because of the certain health effects , or as a solution to deal with the greater demands from the workplace . Social outings and visits , and family dinners are two of the first things that get cut back on due to the work / family conflict . In a study by Ari <unk> , May V. Kevin , et al. found that if a man put a higher importance on their family , were more likely to stay home from work in order to deal with extreme family demands . Ways that the double burden can be lessened for is with hired help in the house , day @-@ care facilities , and longer maternity leaves for women . For instance , in Norway women are allowed the options of 10 months of maternity leave , where they will get 100 % of their pay , or 12 months leave , where they will only paid 80 % of their earnings . Some companies are realizing the effect the double burden of work and a family is having on their employees and are offering flexible work schedules in order to help their employees cope . Not only do these flexible hours help the employee deal with their stress , but it also benefits the company because workers are happier , less likely to be absent , more productive , and the turnover rate is lower for the company . As Sophia Mwangi says , " Parenthood is a joy . Let us never be burdened by it but let 's celebrate the joy that it brings . Celebrate those first steps or words , the first school play , their graduation day , passing those exams , landing their first job , getting married , making you grandparents . Whatever it is , let 's celebrate our children . It 's not easy , but the art of juggling can always be mastered ! " 
 = = = Family vs. school = = = 
 Raising a family is not an easy task , and deciding to go back to school while raising a family can be a <unk> decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish <unk> @-@ ment & Vocational Service . Her advice to those considering going back to school is , " Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in . " She adds , " This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family . Will you be available to go to your child 's softball game or have time to cook dinner ? " There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older , such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age . However , once the children get older the parent pursuing an education , may start missing school events that they would have normally attended . The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response . Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost , the benefits include getting a higher paying job , gaining more knowledge , and becoming more stable financially . Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling , because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment . For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family , there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course , but it will all take place online . For example , the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online .

 = = = = Single parent double burdens = = = = 
 " Single Parents do not typically have the luxury of dividing tasks between two adults in the home . " " The Parents in a married @-@ couple family may be able to divide their tasks so that one parent specializes more in work @-@ related and income @-@ producing activities and the other parent specializes more in home @-@ related , non @-@ income producing activities . " Married parents have that option to split the workload , even though it usually does not happen , but single parents do not have the option of sharing the workload with anyone . 
 The double burden is usually view as a primary problem for single women or married women . However , it is often less recognized that men can and often do go through the same trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family . Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis , Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler . Eichler says , " Social science fails to understand men " by tending " to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men . " Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden , but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work . Though single fathers face the same amount of problems that single mothers face , they have two advantages that play in their favor . Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women . However , until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house , men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does . They must deal with the balancing of work , childcare , and domestic responsibilities . Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent , and they are challenged psychologically . " The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents . He has to change the way he feels about himself as man . " A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career . A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family . With that being said , single fathers feel the same , if not more , of the effect of the double burden as women do . 
 The double burden that single mothers endure has a historical precedent , and still exists currently . Single mothers usually have higher rates of employment and children at home , and have the highest levels overall of the double burden . Women also typically have less economic resources than men , and have no partner to share the workload with them . Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability . They may face job discrimination and not earn as much , so there will be further difficulties in maintaining the double burden . Single @-@ mother families tend to hover near the poverty line , with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men . 
 = = = = Married parent double burdens = = = = 
 Because of women 's expanded roles in the workforce have generally not been accompanied by any relaxation of expectations for their family and domestic activities , many women today face the " double burden " of home and work responsibilities . Women take on the largest portion of the domestic obligations of the home , even when they are working full @-@ time jobs . This breeds anger and frustration , as women know they do the majority of the housework on top of their careers . There have been said to be more reasons , other than gender roles , as to why there is a difference in the housework performed by men and women . Some theories have suggested that women 's expectations for household cleanliness are higher than men 's . Women feel like they must be responsible for the condition of the home in a way that men do not . Men do invest most of their time in their careers , but women spend double that time caring for the children , state of the home and taking care of the domestic responsibilities . In a graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2004 , that compare the workload of married men and women between the ages of 25 @-@ 54 , women are displayed as performing one hundred percent more housework than men , and men are displayed as having more leisure time than women . As the double burden increased in 1980 , women became more critical of their marriages than men and wanted the men to do more around the house to ease the burden of a second shift . The double burden of women who have jobs and still shoulder the majority of the housework at home leads to women filing or initiating divorce . 
 This concept of the double burden with married couples is a worldwide phenomenon . Throughout different cultures of the world , women spend more total hours in work than men do . In Japan , once married , they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home , even after a full day of work . Latin American women , now entering the work force in large numbers , still face what they call <unk> <unk> , or double day 's journey . Although in the Latin American culture , men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more , the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house . Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work . European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care . They are more likely to help their wives at home , yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally . Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor : they may believe in an equal workload in the house , but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through . 
 = = = Middle @-@ class vs. poor families = = = 
 = = = = Middle @-@ class families = = = = 
 Middle @-@ class families often use substitutes for domestic work to make up for the lost time while working in the paid sector . They buy time taking care of children by using hired help and day @-@ care centers . They also decrease the burden of paid work and unpaid work by using household appliances such as microwaves , laundry machines , and <unk> , as well as buying pre @-@ made food , eating out and using laundry services . 
 = = = = Poor families = = = = 
 Poor families are much more constrained in their economic ability to " buy back " lost time through the market . Instead of buying market substitutes , they try to meet their needs without spending money by taking care of children instead of hiring help , taking care of the sick instead of taking them to the hospital , and making food from scratch instead of buying pre @-@ made food . The way that poor families deal with the time debt is for the main caretaker to intensify the time that they spend working , by doing multiple jobs at once instead of doing one job at a time . When people increase the intensity of their work to compensate for their lack of time to finish everything that needs to get done , called work intensity , many health problems occur .

 = = = Health effects = = = 
 = = = = Stress = = = = 
 When faced with the double burden of having to deal with the responsibilities of both a career as well as domestic duties , sometimes a person 's health is affected . Many people faced with these circumstances have a higher chance of being sick since health and stress seem to be correlated , as stress has been implicated in up to eighty percent of all illnesses , as found by a report done by the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women . In an article that was written by a team of researchers it was found that both men and women faced with a " spillover " of work and family issues were 1 @.@ 5 @-@ 1 @.@ 6 times more likely to have an absence due to sickness than others . Men and women in these situations have also been proven to be more likely to be faced with psychological stress and even see themselves as <unk> than their colleagues who are not in their situation . 
 Although women faced with double burden usually have more stress than most women in today 's society , it was proven that in most cases they are psychologically healthier than women who are not faced with these circumstances , for either being a stay at home mother or for being a working woman without children to take care of . 
 = = = = Mortality rate = = = = 
 In a study done by Rosamund <unk> , Heather Joshi and Susan <unk> of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994 , the research presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives . The women who were observed that had part @-@ time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full @-@ time jobs and children . The same study also suggests that women who have young children are less likely to die than women who have no children or have older children . Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field , it can give a good indication of a trend in society . Also , this study was conducted in multiple countries including England , Wales , and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden . 
 = = = = <unk> due to sickness = = = = 
 In several Western countries it has been seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men . When investigating the reasons behind this , a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found that half of the difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women . When taking into account the health effects of double burden , child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health . In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect . It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation . Additionally , working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts . 
 = = = = Loss of sleep = = = = 
 The stress of maintaining a career and a household can also lead to a loss of sleep . In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job . At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well . Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone , they may hold to be true . It was found that working women sleep twenty @-@ five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work . Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties . It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty @-@ six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties . 
 = = = = Work intensity = = = = 
 For many poor women and men whose work hours have reached the point where they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for domestic and paid work , work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once , such as taking care of children while cooking . Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences , such as lack of sleep , stress , and lack of recreation . 
 = = = Economic effects = = = 
 There are many economic effects to the person who has to shoulder the double burden . Oftentimes , this tends to be the woman in the relationship , and so there has been analysis done on the economic effect of the double burden on women . According to <unk> ( 2002 ) , because women often earn less than men , there is the thought that the woman should be the one to fit her paid job around household activities such as taking care of children . Because of this , and because they have many domestic duties , women often take part @-@ time jobs and jobs in the informal sector in order to balance paid work with domestic work . Part @-@ time jobs and jobs in the informal sector do earn less than full @-@ time jobs , so men have to increase their paid work hours in order to compensate for the lacking family income . This will " weaken her earning power and strengthen his " , leading to an unequal distribution of power in the household , and allow the man to exploit the woman 's unpaid work . This situation could have negative consequences especially for the woman because she is perceived to have less contribution to the household , due to domestic work being seen as less of a contribution than paid work . Such negative consequences include the lack of a divorce threat , where the woman does not have the economic means to ask for a divorce because she does not have a full @-@ time job , and she has less money that she personally receives , decreasing her perceived contributions to the household . 
 = = Solutions to the double burden = = 
 = = = Family @-@ friendly initiatives = = = 
 Family @-@ friendly initiatives are a possible solution to redistributing the load of unpaid work and alleviating the double burden . Possible initiatives include flexible work hours ; part @-@ time and job @-@ sharing options ; parental leave ; child care subsidies ; and on @-@ site daycare options . There are two primary approaches to assisting working families : " One stresses the importance of action from within , with emphasis on private , internal , local initiatives within firms and organizations to alter workplace norms , conventions , and practices . The other approach calls for government interventions designed to facilitate proper care for children with less sacrifice of parents ' job opportunities , advancement , and compensation " . 
 = = = Government initiatives = = = 
 The Nordic countries exemplify the use of family @-@ friendly initiatives . For example , a nine @-@ month parental leave is divided into thirds in Iceland . Three months are for the mother . Three non @-@ transferable months are for the father , and there are three months that both parents can share . " The reimbursement is 80 per cent of the salary . From 2001 to October 2003 , the average number of days taken by men increased from 39 to 83 , and 13 per cent of Icelandic fathers used more than their non @-@ transferable part . " Dual @-@ income families are becoming the norm , especially in industrialized countries , so it is not uncommon for large corporations to practice some form of family @-@ friendly initiative . 
 Government family @-@ friendly initiatives such as child subsidies and cheaper child care facilities can also greatly decrease the gender difference in the workplace , due to the woman being able to work longer hours outside the home . In addition , when developing policies related to paid work , it is important to do gender impact assessments in order to assess the impact of a policy on both the paid and unpaid sector . 
 = = = Workplace initiatives = = = 
 Whenever there is talk about new policies regarding new work time policies , there is often the argument for longer work hours in exchange for a shorter work week . For example , many are in favor of longer work hours such as " three ten @-@ hour days or four eight @-@ hour days " . However , this is often not the best work hours for people who take care of children , because children go to school for perhaps six hours a day , not eight or ten . Caretakers would prefer the opposite - shorter hours and longer weeks , such as six hour work days for six times a week , with limits on evening work and overtime , as well as flexible schedules . In order to lessen the burden of taking care of children and domestic duties as well as working in the paid sector , workplaces should consider policies that take into account the preferred work hours of caretakers . In addition , it is often the case now that many workers juggle domestic work and paid work . In order to get the most effective workers , companies should consider changing their policies in order to attract the best people in the field .

 A paper rejecting statistics of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions as " the main source of tendentious polemics on women ’ s unfair burden and gender inequality " , states that the idea of a double burden is a myth and conclude instead that " on average , women and men across Europe do the same total number of productive work hours , once paid jobs and unpaid household work are added together – roughly eight hours a day .

 " Birthday Cake " is a song by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna , from her sixth studio album , Talk That Talk ( 2011 ) . After it leaked onto the internet , fans expressed interest in the track being included on Talk That Talk , but it was later revealed that the 1 : 18 ( one minute , 18 seconds ) length that leaked was in fact the final cut and was not being considered for inclusion on the album . Due to a high level of fan interest , the song was included on the album as an interlude . The full length version , also known as the official remix of the track , featuring Rihanna 's ex @-@ boyfriend Chris Brown , was premiered online on February 20 , 2012 , to coincide with Rihanna 's 24th birthday . The song peaked in the top fifty . 
 The lyrics to " Birthday Cake " express the desire to have spontaneous sex . Music critics were divided on " Birthday Cake " , with the majority both praising and criticising the song 's sexual lyrical content . Several critics compared the song to the previous track on the album " Cockiness ( Love It ) " , which also consists of sexually explicit lyrics . Upon the release of Talk That Talk , the song debuted on the lower regions of the singles charts in South Korea , the United Kingdom , and the United States .

In an interview for The Boom Box , producer The @-@ Dream answered a question about fans being disappointed that " Birthday Cake " would not be featured on Talk That Talk ( 2011 ) after it leaked online before the album 's November 2011 release ; the producer explained that only an interlude had been produced , and that a full length version of the song would be released at some point during the Talk That Talk era , saying : 
 I was just talking to Rihanna about that , because she [ originally ] made [ just ] an interlude . I was like , ' Your fans are going to be so mad at you . ' As soon as I said that , I got back , and I guess she released a piece of it , and they saw how long it is . Man , they tore me up on Twitter ! So I hit her on the phone . I was like , ' Yo , your fans , they 're going crazy on me right now , like I could make you do something . ' So ' Birthday Cake ' is on there .

 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Birthday Cake " is an interlude which lasts for one minute and 18 seconds , appearing as the sixth track on the album . The instrumentation of " Birthday Cake " consists of a heavy bass , <unk> , engine sounds , claps , and electro beats . The track also consists of <unk> synths , synth handclaps , an Eastern @-@ inspired tone and chants . In the song , Rihanna adopts a sensual tone in her vocals , as she chants the song 's provocative and sexually explicit lyrics . The majority of the interlude is rapped by Rihanna . A reviewer for Flavour described the singer 's vocal performance in " Birthday Cake " as " sultry " . Nathan S. of DJ Booth concurred that Rihanna sounds " sultry " as well as " playful " on the song . 
 The lyrical content of the interlude is spare and largely revolves around Rihanna chanting , " cake cake cake cake cake cake . " Aside from the repetitive chant of " cake " , the interlude consists of multiple sexual metaphors . The lyric " I know you wanna bite this / It 's so enticing / Nothing else like this , I 'ma make you my bitch / And it 's not even my birthday / But you wanna put your name on it " is a metaphor referring to a vagina . Rihanna sings about the desire to have spontaneous sex . Rihanna promises her lover that she will make him do whatever she pleases , singing " I 'mma make you my bitch . " T 'Cha Dunlevy of The Montreal Gazette described the lyric as a " promise " , with Rihanna intending to act upon her desires . The interlude ends mid @-@ verse and mid @-@ lyric with a fade at 1 : 18 . Katherine St. Asaph of Popdust described the fade as " ungraceful " , as well as writing that it makes the track appear as though it is not finished . Upon the fade , Rihanna puts forward the line " Ooh , I wanna fuck you right now . " Dunlevy and St. Asaph were critical of the final line , with the former labelling it as " blatant " , and the latter noting that " cursing makes everything obvious . "

 " Birthday Cake " garnered mixed reviews from music critics . Jayson Lipshutz of Billboard praised the interlude , writing " We 're all for birthday @-@ themed naughtiness in pop music form , but only 78 seconds of ' Birthday Cake ' is just not enough of a celebration ! " Lipshutz continued to compare the song 's lyrical message to Jeremih 's " Birthday Sex " . Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy was complimentary of " Birthday Cake " , writing , " The only misstep on the album – not because it 's not amazing ( it is ! ) , but because it 's only 78 seconds long . ' Birthday Cake ' is more decadent Rihanna filth , this time courtesy of sensual R & B @-@ master The @-@ Dream . Have any Rihanna Navy members made an hour @-@ long mix yet ? We need to keep the bump ' n ' grind going all night . " Pip Ellwood of Entertainment @-@ Focus noted that " Birthday Cake " , along with " Cockiness ( Love It ) " , " leave you under no misunderstanding that Rihanna is as sexual as she 's ever been throughout her career . " Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that " Birthday Cake " , along with " Cockiness ( Love It ) " , were the most provocative songs on the album , describing them as " I @-@ like @-@ it @-@ rough tracks " , but criticized them for being album fillers designed to get the listener out of the bedroom and on to the dance floor . 
 Adrian Thrills of the Daily Mail wrote that after listening to " Cockiness ( Love It ) " and then " Birthday Cake " , " the double entendres have grown tiresome " after having listening to the latter . Giovanny Caquias of CultureBlues expressed distaste for " Birthday Cake " , calling the track " horrendous " , but referred to it being " only a minimal waste of time " due to its short length . Mike Diver of BBC Music was equally critical , writing that " Birthday Cake " is a " wholly pointless minute @-@ something in the company of star producer The @-@ Dream , wasted on the boring profanities of Birthday Cake . " A reviewer for Flavour had a mixed reaction to the lyrical content , writing , " I can 't exactly say it is a bad song . In fact , I will probably be singing it over the next few weeks . But at this point its like , ' we get it – you like sex . ' Chill out about it and sing about education or something – your younger fans need more <unk> . " [ sic ] Nathan S. of DJ Booth noted that the song resembles a real life " quickie " , continuing to write that the overtly sexual lyrics in the song earned Talk That Talk the Parental Advisory sticker . Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times commented that the lyrics on " Birthday Cake " " wouldn 't seem out of place on Spinal Tap 's ' Smell the Glove ' . " Roberts continued to note that " Birthday Cake " appeared to be an afterthought , writing , 
 The hottest lines on the album come nearly as an afterthought on the all @-@ too @-@ brief ' Birthday Cake , ' produced by The @-@ Dream . ' I know you wanna bite this / It 's so <unk> ' / Nothin ' else like this / I 'mma make you my bitch , ' she sings . But as if the network censors had let the song run before realizing their mistake , a little over a minute into it the music fades out , just as it 's getting dirty , leaving us wondering whether Rihanna really believes what she 's selling on " Talk That Talk .

 " Birthday Cake " was remixed with vocals from American recording artist Chris Brown , and is a full length version of the interlude which was originally included on Talk That Talk . It was sent to radio as the fourth US single from the album on March 6 , 2012 . At first , it was rumored that Christina Aguilera would feature on the remix version after Rihanna posted a message on Twitter saying that she wanted someone " <unk> " on the re @-@ recording , a supposed reference to Aguilera 's 2002 song " Dirrty " . However , the singer later tweeted that she wanted a male vocalist , not a female vocalist , to accompany her on the remix via Twitter with a tweet reading ' No girls allowed on # CAKE ' . It was later revealed that Brown was the featured artist on the full length version . Despite receiving negative attention regarding Rihanna 's choice of collaborator from the media and fans alike , the singer defended her decision saying that it is simply music . 
 The remix of " Birthday Cake " ' s lyrics are similar to the interlude , but with new lyrics provided by Brown . Critical reception of the collaboration was met with a mixed response from music critics , many of whom were shocked at the fact that Rihanna and Brown had collaborated on a song together despite their relationship history , but cited the remix as an improvement upon the original interlude . The remix peaked at number 24 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , and number two on the R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs chart . American rappers Fabolous , Rick Ross and Busta Rhymes appeared on additional remixes of the song .

 Due to the high level of demand by the singer 's fans to release a full length of " Birthday Cake " , Rihanna posted a message via her official Twitter account , promising that it was at the top of her agenda to record and release it . Despite fans wanting to hear the updated version , Katherine St. Asaph of PopDust criticized the notion , writing " Honestly , at this point Rihanna and Def Jam would be better off just calling ' Birthday Cake ' an interlude , not an incomplete version , because otherwise that 's saying the album is released but essentially unfinished . " Beck Bain of Idolator noted that the release of the full length song is " doubtful " , writing " the song is already too dirty in its current minute @-@ and @-@ twenty @-@ second version . But if ' S & M ' could be a single , is anything [ sic ] too risque for the radio these days ? " 
 In February 2012 , it was speculated that Christina Aguilera would appear as the featured artist on the release after Rihanna posted a message on Twitter saying , " I need somebody # <unk> [ sic ] on my Birthday # CAKE [ sic ] , " a supposed reference to Aguilera 's 2002 song " Dirrty " , which contains lyrical content relating to various sexual activities . The singer later confirmed that she did not want a female artist to feature on the collaboration , stating , " No girls allowed on # CAKE . [ sic ] " On February 15 , 2012 , <unk> of Da Internz , who produced the interlude , revealed that the featured collaborator will " shock the world , " and that the full length version would premiere between February 16 , and February 20 , 2012 .

 On February 16 , 2012 , it was speculated that former boyfriend Chris Brown was the featured artist on the full length version . Reports surfaced after the pair were photographed leaving Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles at separate times and Brown being invited to Rihanna 's birthday party . Rumors were also fueled when Rihanna and Brown spent time together at the 2012 Grammy Awards on February 8 , 2012 . The reports gained worldwide media controversy , because Brown and Rihanna were involved in a physical altercation on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards . The full length version , eventually revealed to feature Brown , was released on Rihanna 's birthday , February 20 , 2012 . In an interview with Billboard , The @-@ Dream stated that he believed Rihanna and Brown 's past together should not be judged and that " Birthday Cake " is simply a song , saying , " For me , it 's just music - two talented people doing a record together , doing two records together , and that 's what it was . It wasn 't about an incident that happened . The true thing really is to forgive , and you want to believe in people . " " Birthday Cake " impacted US Urban contemporary radio on March 6 , 2012 , serving as the fourth U.S. single from Talk That Talk . 
 On March 15 , 2012 , Rihanna explained her collaboration with Brown to Ryan Seacrest during his morning show : " The first song that came about was ' Birthday Cake ' . I mean , we ended up recording them at the same time and executing them together . But I reached out to him about doing ' Birthday Cake ' because that ’ s the only person that , really , it made sense to do the record . Just as a musician , despite everything else , that was going to be the person . You know I thought about rappers , and I ’ ve done that so many times , and the hottest R & B artist out right now is Chris Brown . So I wanted him on the track , and then in turn he was like , ‘ Why don ’ t you do the remix to my track ? ’ and it was a trade @-@ off . We did two records . One for my fans , one for his fans , and that way our fans can come together . There shouldn ’ t be a divide . You know ? It ’ s music , and it ’ s innocent . " In March 2012 , American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the " Birthday Cake " remix . The following month , Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself , along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses . Busta Rhymes released his own freestyle to the song along with rapper Reek da <unk> .

 Brown 's verse begins with the lyric " Girl , I wanna fuck you right now , " which is the antithesis of how Rihanna concludes the original interlude , sing " Ooh , I wanna fuck you right now . " Brown 's verse continues with " Been a long time I 've been missing your body / Turn the lights down / When I go down it 's a private party . " Brown delivers his vocals in an aggressive and manipulative manner as he sings " Give it to her in the worst way , can 't wait to blow her candles out . " At the end of the song , Rihanna performs new lyrics which were not included on the original 1 minute and 18 second interlude ; " Remember how you did it / If you still wanna kiss it / Then come and get it . " According to Ben Rayner of the Toronto Sun , the instrumentation of " Birthday Cake " consists of " snaky , <unk> , bass @-@ <unk> ' beats . " The song 's lyrics revolve around sadomasochistic sexuality and dominance over men , and consists mainly of oral sex metaphors , including the lyric " Doggy want the kitty . " 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Beth Hardie for the Daily Mirror wrote that the remix came as a shock , because of how Brown " beat her virtually senseless in a car three years ago just before the Grammys , " and noted that Rihanna would face harsh criticism from journalists and fans alike for not setting a good example to younger girls . Hardie continued to state that although the collaboration came as a surprise , " We have to admit , it ’ s a pretty amazing stroke of genius in terms of publicity and messing with people ’ s minds . " Regarding the collaboration on the remix Jo Usmar from Daily Mirror compared the collaboration to the physical altercation between Rihanna and Brown at the 2009 Grammy Awards , writing " In case you 've been living in a cave for the last two years this is extraordinarily controversial as Brown was convicted of assaulting Rihanna in 2009 and there was a restraining order issued against him . " Ben Rayner for the Toronto Sun was complimentary of the remix , writing that it was an improvement upon the original interlude , " What was empty , unfinished titillation before , then , has become empty , overstated , boardroom @-@ written pseudo @-@ pornography for the pop charts . " 
 Jon Caramanica for The New York Times commented that the remix of " Birthday Cake " , as well as the original , was " very much so " a good song . However , Caramanica was critical of the collaboration itself , due to Rihanna and Brown 's history , writing " You want to forget ? Fine . But don ’ t forgive . " Caramanica continued to explain his distaste , writing " It displays an advanced understanding of marketing and an understanding of moral obligations and ethics that 's not much more than rudimentary . It is a woman publicly accepting her abuser - nothing more , nothing less . " J. Bryan Lowder for The Huffington Post labelled the song as " innuendo @-@ iced " with regard to the song 's explicit lyrics . Lowder provided an explanation for what he thought the reason was behind Rihanna asking Brown to collaborate on " Birthday Cake " , writing : 
 Even though we know that collaborations like this are almost always commercial in motivation , we like to imagine that the artist 's choice of a creative partner gives us some kind of access to their private , emotional world . Collaboration suggests a personal relationship , and our eavesdropping on that interplay conjures up a feeling of intimacy between audience and artist that is very powerful . We feel like we know what 's really going on with Rihanna and Chris Brown because we are virtually present in the studio with them , and here , the thing we 're meant to know is that everything 's OK now . The problem is , the strategy won 't work ; because of an infamous leaked photograph , we were also virtually present in the car that night three years ago when Brown beat Rihanna till her face was bruised and bloodied . And that kind of terrifying intimacy is not easily forgotten .

 Rihanna performed " Birthday Cake " Remix at Radio 1 's Hackney Weekend on May 24 , 2012 , as the fifth song on the set list . She performed the remix in its entirety , and sang Brown 's lyrics . The song was later included on her Diamonds World Tour in 2013 during the first act .

 Johann MacDougall Lamont ( / <unk> <unk> / ; born 11 July 1957 ) is a Scottish politician , who was leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2011 to 2014 . She served as a junior minister in the Labour @-@ Liberal Democrat coalition Scottish Executive from 2004 until the coalition 's defeat by the Scottish National Party ( SNP ) in 2007 . She was subsequently elected deputy leader of the opposition Labour group of MSPs in 2008 , and was elected to lead the Labour Party in December 2011 . She announced her resignation in October 2014 , and following a leadership election to replace her , was succeeded by Jim Murphy in December . 
 Born in Glasgow , Lamont attended the city 's Woodside Secondary School and obtained a degree from the University of Glasgow . After studying for teaching qualifications at Jordanhill College , she became a schoolteacher . Active in the Labour Party since her university days , Lamont served on its Scottish Executive Committee , and chaired it in 1993 . With the establishment of a devolved legislature in Scotland , she was elected as the Labour Co @-@ operative Member of the Scottish Parliament ( MSP ) for Glasgow Pollok in 1999 . Having been appointed convener of the Scottish Parliament 's Social Justice Committee in 2001 , she obtained her first ministerial role in October 2004 . Her decision to stand for the Labour Party leadership followed the resignation of Iain Gray as leader in the wake of the party 's defeat at the 2011 Scottish general election — its second consecutive defeat . Following a review of how the Labour Party in Scotland is structured , she became its first overall leader . 
 Lamont has been a campaigner on equality issues and violence against women throughout her political career . Following the SNP Government 's announcement of a referendum on Scottish independence she was a key figure in Better Together , the cross @-@ party movement that sought to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom . Lamont believes that Labour lost the 2011 election because it had lost its direction , and initiated a review of Scottish Labour policy on issues like devolution and the party 's commitment to free universal public services . Her work won her accolades at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards , for Political Impact of the Year in 2012 and Debater of the Year in 2013 . In Parliamentary debates she was perceived by commentators such as The Scotsman 's Andrew Whitaker as being an effective opponent to First Minister Alex Salmond , but others , including Richard Seymour of The Guardian , criticised her for clumsiness during television interviews . Lamont resigned as Labour leader in October 2014 , making the announcement in a Daily Record interview in which she claimed that senior figures within the UK Labour Party had undermined her attempts to reform the Scottish party , and treated it " like a branch office of London " .

 Johann Lamont was born in the Anderston district of Glasgow on 11 July 1957 . Her parents , Archie and Effie , were both Gaelic speakers from crofting families on the Inner Hebridean island of Tiree , who met after both had moved to Glasgow . Archie was a carpenter employed by the Scottish ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne , working on the Mallaig to Skye route . He took part in the Seamen 's Strike of 1966 . The family were Presbyterians , and Lamont 's mother was influenced in her faith by the American evangelist Billy Graham . Her first experiences of public speakers was listening to the preachers her mother took her to see as a girl . 
 Lamont 's childhood was divided between Glasgow and her mother 's family home on Tiree , where she and her brother David spent their summer holidays . She attended Woodside Secondary School , having declined to take scholarship exams for selective education . Like her parents , she was a Gaelic speaker , but she did not believe she spoke it well enough , and she dropped it at school in favour of French and German . It was also at school that she first developed an interest in politics , once entering a Daily Mirror competition with a politically @-@ themed short story . The tale , whose central character discussed her intention to demand a pay rise and was finally revealed to be the Queen , won Lamont third prize . She studied English and History at the University of Glasgow , graduating with an MA . Joining the Labour Party in 1975 , she was active in the Glasgow University Labour Club where she was a contemporary of fellow Labour politician Margaret Curran , and was also involved with the women 's movement . She trained as a teacher for a year at Jordanhill College , gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education , and afterwards joined Rothesay Academy , Isle of Bute , as a teacher in 1979 . She taught at Springburn Academy in Glasgow from 1982 to 1989 and at <unk> High School , also in Glasgow , from 1990 to 1999 . Lamont taught English and worked with social workers and educational psychologists attempting to tackle instances of school truancy . 
 Continuing to be active in the Labour Party , Lamont became a prominent campaigner on issues related to social justice , equality and devolution . Although she had voted no in the 1979 referendum that proposed the establishment of a Scottish Assembly , during the 1980s and 1990s she was a representative on the Scottish Constitutional Convention , the body that paved the way for Scottish devolution . Of her 1979 decision , Lamont has said that she " came from the strand on the left which saw the politics of nationalism as a diversion from more central aims [ but later ] came to see the parliament as a vehicle for democratic change in Scotland . " She was a member of the Scottish Executive Committee of the Labour Party , serving as chair in 1993 . 
 = = MSP for Glasgow Pollok = = 
 Although a Labour activist for two decades , Lamont had not sought election to the House of Commons during that time , telling a 2014 BBC interview there were few chances for women to be elected to Westminster : " In 1987 Labour sent down 50 MPs and only one of them was a woman . " Instead , her decision to seek political office was influenced by the creation of the Scottish Parliament . Speaking to The Herald in 2011 , she said , " It is easy to forget what a great opportunity it was for women and I was determined that women would be represented , would have a strong voice . " The parliament was established as a result of the 1997 referendum that saw a 74 % vote in favour of devolving legislative powers to Scotland . Lamont was first elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament ( MSP ) for Glasgow Pollok in 1999 . She held the seat in 2003 , when she faced a strong challenge from the Scottish Socialist Party leader Tommy Sheridan , and then again in 2007 and 2011 . 
 During her maiden speech on 17 May 1999 , Lamont was the first MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament . She served on a number of the Parliament 's committees during her first term in office , including the Equal Opportunities Committee , the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee . She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001 . In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour @-@ led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of <unk> and Warrant Sales Bill , which had been introduced by Sheridan . The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment , and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation . At a session of First Minister 's Questions in 2002 , she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down . Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long , but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate , and accusations from Lamont 's colleague , Labour 's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally , an allegation he rejected .

 Lamont was appointed convener of the Communities Committee in 2003 . In March 2004 the Committee endorsed a bill aimed at tackling antisocial behaviour , which included plans for parenting orders and the electronic tagging of youths under the age of 16 . First Minister Jack McConnell made her Deputy Minister for Communities in the Scottish Executive in October 2004 . In that post she was responsible for the launch of a radio and television advertising campaign aimed at tackling domestic abuse that aired over Christmas 2005 , and she expressed concerns over the level of discrimination faced by travellers and gypsies after the issue was highlighted in a 2005 Scottish Parliament report . 
 In November 2006 , Lamont was appointed Deputy Minister for Justice and oversaw reforms to Scotland 's Lower Courts system . She held the post until Labour was defeated at the 2007 election . McConnell appointed her as Labour 's spokesperson for Communities and Sport in his post @-@ election frontbench team , a role she retained in the shadow cabinet formed by his successor , Wendy Alexander , in September 2007 . Following Alexander 's decision to step down as leader of the Labour MSPs in June 2008 , and Cathy Jamieson 's subsequent resignation as her deputy , Lamont stood against fellow MSP Bill Butler for the position vacated by Jamieson . She was elected as deputy leader in September 2008 with 60 @.@ 16 percent of the vote , against 39 @.@ 82 percent for Butler . At the same time , Iain Gray was elected to lead the Labour group at Holyrood . 
 In addition to her deputy leadership role , Lamont was appointed Chief of Staff with special responsibility for <unk> . While in that post she gave her support to Scottish Government plans to introduce a Bill outlawing forced marriage , which was announced in September 2010 . In February 2011 , she criticised Scottish Conservative MSP and Justice Committee <unk> , Bill Aitken after the Sunday Herald quoted him making a controversial statement about a rape victim , and later welcomed his subsequent resignation . As Gray 's deputy Lamont also represented Labour at First Minister 's Questions in his absence . At a session of First Minister 's Questions in October 2009 , she raised the issue of the Scottish Futures Trust with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon , asking whether the public body planned to spend any money on improving school infrastructure before the 2011 election .

 In the wake of Labour 's second defeat at the Scottish Parliament election of May 2011 , which saw the Scottish National Party ( SNP ) form its first majority government , Gray announced his intention to step down as leader of the Labour MSPs later that year . A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party 's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs , as previous leaders had . Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University . She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again : " We must listen and learn , show humility and seek again to talk for and to people 's ambitions and concerns . Our real challenge is that we in Labour lost our way , lost our confidence and lost Scotland . " 
 Lamont 's opponents in the leadership race were the MP Tom Harris , and her fellow MSP Ken Macintosh , both of whom had also expressed a need for Labour to change if it was to win the next election . Harris 's campaign centred on the belief that Labour had to " [ re @-@ establish ] itself as the party of aspiration " , or it would risk becoming " an irrelevance " . McIntosh felt the party had focussed too heavily on its traditional support in the Central Belt while paying less attention to rural communities . He suggested increasing government help to tackle unemployment among young people , and wanted to nationalise rail and bus services . 
 The result of the election was announced on 17 December 2011 and saw Lamont secure an overall majority with 51 @.@ 77 % of the vote in the first round . Her closest rival was Macintosh with 40 @.@ 28 % , while Harris was third with 7 @.@ 95 % . Lamont also won majorities in two groups of Labour 's three @-@ tier electoral college system , securing the support of parliamentarians and affiliated bodies such as trade unions . Macintosh was backed by the majority of individual party members . In her acceptance speech , Lamont told party activists , " Together we will change the Scottish Labour Party and win the chance to serve the people of Scotland again and make Scotland all that we know it can be . " On the same day , MP Anas Sarwar was elected to the position of Deputy that Lamont had vacated . 
 = = = Shadow Cabinet = = = 
 Lamont began appointing members of her shadow cabinet on 19 December 2011 . Those given positions on her initial frontbench team include Macintosh ( Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance , Employment and Sustainable Growth ) , Hugh Henry ( Labour spokesman for Education and Lifelong Learning ) , Lewis Macdonald ( Shadow Justice Minister ) and Boyack ( Local Government and Planning ) . The post of Shadow Health Minister was given to Jackie Baillie , who had held the position previously . Gray was not included , as he had expressed a wish to take a break from frontline politics . 
 Lamont announced a major shakeup of the Labour frontbench team on 28 June 2013 . Gray returned to replace Macintosh as the party 's finance spokesman . Macdonald was appointed chief whip , and his previous role as Shadow Justice Minister was given to Graeme Pearson . Baillie was moved from Health to Social Justice and Welfare . Boyack kept her role in Local Government and Planning . Speaking about the reshuffle , Lamont said , " We have made a great deal of progress in the last 18 months but we have to keep moving forward . " 
 = = = First months in office = = = 
 Lamont gave her first post @-@ election interview to The Politics Show Scotland on 18 December 2011 , speaking of the " huge challenge " of rebuilding public trust in Scottish Labour after its election defeat of the previous May , and a general decline in support over the preceding decade . Attributing the party 's losses to its failure to engage with the electorate , she told the programme that Labour needed to speak up for the interests of the Scottish people , and accept more devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament . Attending her first session of First Minister 's Questions as Labour leader on 22 December 2011 , she addressed the issue of child neglect following the conviction of a Glasgow woman for the murder of her son and asking what lessons could be learned from the case . 
 In January 2012 , as the SNP Government prepared for a referendum on Scottish independence , she spoke out in defence of Scotland 's position in the United Kingdom after First Minister Salmond claimed that the country was not an equal partner in the union . Along with Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie , the respective leaders of the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats , and Deputy First Minister Sturgeon , Lamont added her signature to a February 2012 letter urging Glasgow City Council to decline an application by the Scottish Defence League to stage a march through the city . The group , an offshoot of the far @-@ right English Defence League , subsequently withdrew their application , and a " static " demonstration was held instead . 
 Lamont gave her first conference speech as party leader at Scottish Labour 's conference in March 2012 , setting out an agenda for rebuilding confidence in the party . Later the same month she welcomed the passing of the Scotland Bill , which devolved further powers to Scotland in accordance with the recommendations of the Calman Commission , praising it as " an important development of devolution " . In May 2012 she participated in the Scottish Parliament debate paying tribute to Queen Elizabeth as the UK celebrated her Diamond Jubilee . Lamont commented , " 60 years in the one job is good going – I 've been in this one for just six months and some days , I have to say , it feels like 60 years – so we recognise the scale of the achievement of the particular , very strong woman . " Lamont was a guest on the 7 June 2012 edition of the BBC 's political debate programme Question Time . 
 = = = Standing in the polls = = = 
 A poll conducted by Ipsos MORI in December 2011 as Lamont took control of Scottish Labour indicated that the party had an approval rating of 26 % , almost half that of the Scottish National Party with 51 % . A survey by the same organisation in June 2012 showed an improvement for Labour , with 32 % against the Nationalists ' 45 % . The same poll indicated a personal approval rating for Lamont of 9 % , compared to 13 % for Salmond . A poll conducted by Ipsos MORI on behalf of STV in September 2013 indicated that 37 % of respondents were satisfied with Labour 's performance compared to 41 % for the SNP . That survey found that Lamont had a personal approval rating of + 6 % , against + 8 % for Salmond . Another Ipsos MORI poll for STV in December 2013 showed Labour on 34 % with 36 % for the SNP , while Lamont had overtaken Salmond in terms of personal approval with + 9 for her compared to + 7 for the First Minister . 
 A poll on the issue of Scottish independence conducted by TNS @-@ <unk> in December 2013 gave Lamont an approval rating of 6 % among women and 8 % among men , compared with 22 % and 30 % respectively for Salmond . 41 % of respondents to that survey were unaware of her role as Scottish Labour leader , a figure rising to 62 % among those aged 16 – 34 . 
 = = = Local elections and by @-@ elections = = = 
 Lamont launched Labour 's 2012 local election campaign in Edinburgh on 17 April 2012 , setting out policies for creating employment and training opportunities as well as improvements to education and childcare . Claiming that the SNP Government had passed on 89 percent of the spending cuts imposed by the UK Government , she compared the Nationalists to the businessman criticised for his role in the financial collapse of Glasgow Rangers Football Club , saying , " Putting the SNP in charge of a council is like putting Craig Whyte in charge of your tax return . " Retaining control of Glasgow City Council , where Labour was facing a strong challenge from the SNP , was another of the party 's key objectives . After the polls , political academic John Curtice , writing for The Guardian , observed that Lamont " has undoubtedly done enough to dispel doubts about whether she was the right woman for the job " . 
 The 2013 Dunfermline by @-@ election was triggered by the resignation of the SNP 's Bill Walker in the wake of his conviction on several accounts of domestic abuse . On the eve of the poll , Alan Cochrane of The Daily Telegraph described it as an election Labour could not afford to lose because , " For [ Lamont 's ] personal prestige , her candidate simply must win . " Labour won the seat with a swing of 7 percent from the SNP and a majority of 2 @,@ 873 . Lamont said that the result reflected " the progress we 've made " , but Curtice said that if the results were repeated across Scotland , the SNP would still be the majority party at the next election . 
 Labour have also increased their support at other by @-@ elections . At the 2013 Aberdeen <unk> by @-@ election in June , held after the death of the SNP 's Brian Adam , Labour reduced the SNP majority from 7 @,@ 789 to 2 @,@ 025 . The 2014 Cowdenbeath by @-@ election was held following the death of Labour MSP Helen Eadie . The campaign was fought on issues such as education , employment and care for the elderly , and saw Labour increase their share of the vote , with an 11 @.@ 25 percent swing from the SNP and a majority of 5 @,@ 488 .

 Lamont was a prominent figure in the Better Together Campaign , the cross @-@ party political movement founded to keep Scotland as part of the United Kingdom following the SNP 's announcement of a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 . She was outspoken in her opposition to Scottish independence , using a keynote speech at UK Labour 's 2013 conference in Brighton to accuse the SNP of nurturing hostility between Scotland and the rest of the UK , and describing nationalism as a " virus that has affected so many nations and done so much harm " . Lamont is in favour of greater devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament , and established a Commission to look at how this can be achieved . 
 = = = = 2014 referendum and Better Together campaign = = = = 
 After taking office as Labour leader in December 2011 , Lamont urged First Minister Salmond to set a date for the referendum , arguing in her leadership acceptance speech that uncertainty over the referendum 's timeline was having a negative impact on Scotland . On 10 January 2012 Salmond announced late 2014 as his preferred time for a referendum . The Scottish Government confirmed the referendum question on 25 January 2012 , and announced on 21 March 2013 that the referendum would be held on 18 September 2014 . Lamont told Scottish Labour 's 2012 annual conference she wanted her party 's campaign to be one of " collective leadership " against independence , a strategy which she envisaged would become a cross @-@ party movement arguing the case for keeping Scotland in the UK . At the Scottish Conservative Party conference a few weeks later , party leader Ruth Davidson called for Lamont and her opponents to work together . The Better Together Campaign , fronted by former UK Government minister Alistair Darling , was launched at an event attended by Lamont and other senior Scottish political figures at Edinburgh 's Napier University on 25 June 2012 . Along with former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and other senior Scottish Labour figures , Lamont launched the party 's own pro @-@ union campaign , United with Labour in May 2013 . The Scottish Government published Scotland 's Future , a white paper setting out its vision for an independent Scotland , on 26 November 2013 . Lamont dismissed it as " 670 pages of assertion and uncertainty " . Addressing the Shadow Cabinet of UK Labour leader Ed Miliband on 28 January 2014 , Lamont warned that Scots could vote for independence if they believed Labour was unlikely to win the 2015 UK general election . 
 Opinion polls showed an increase in support for the Yes campaign as the referendum approached . On 8 September 2014 , Gordon Brown set out plans for greater devolved powers for Holyrood in the event of a No vote . Lamont joined Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie in giving her backing to the proposals the following day , but Salmond dismissed them as " a retreading , a repackaging , a re @-@ timetabling " of previous promises . Prime Minister David Cameron and Opposition leader Ed Miliband cancelled their appearance at Prime Minister 's Questions to travel to Scotland to campaign for a No vote . On 18 September , Scotland voted to reject independence with a majority of 2 @,@ 001 @,@ 926 to 1 @,@ 617 @,@ 989 . Salmond announced his intention to resign as First Minister and SNP leader on 19 September , shortly after the result of the referendum was confirmed . Lamont paid tribute to him , describing him as " an immense figure in Scottish political history " . Sturgeon was chosen to succeed Salmond as SNP leader on 15 October . 
 = = = = Labour 's Commission on devolution = = = = 
 At the Scottish Labour Party Conference in March 2012 , Lamont announced her intention to establish a Commission to examine the prospect of a fully devolved Scottish Parliament . This would give the Scottish Government the power to make decisions on policies relating to issues such as welfare benefits , income tax and corporation tax , effectively making it a fully self @-@ governing region of the United Kingdom . The Commission , chaired by Lamont and including politicians , academics and trade union members , met for the first time in October 2012 . It published an interim report in April 2013 , recommending that Scotland have autonomy over income tax , but leaving decisions on corporation tax and welfare to the UK Parliament . But party members opposed it , warning that the plans could threaten the Barnett formula , the financial mechanism under which Scotland receives an annual average of £ 1 @,@ 600 per head more in UK Government spending than does the rest of the UK . Ian Davidson , chair of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee said the proposals could affect spending in poorer areas . Macintosh subsequently warned that devolving responsibility for income tax would reduce the Scottish tax base and result in independence by default , a claim that Guy Lodge and Alan Trench of the Institute for Public Policy Research called " highly disingenuous " because income tax makes up only 23 % of the taxes collected by the UK Government . 
 The Commission 's final report , Powers for a Purpose was published on 18 March 2014 , setting out recommendations that would be implemented if Scotland voted no in the referendum , and Labour were elected in 2015 . The proposals included allowing the Scottish Parliament to raise as much as 40 % of its annual revenue , and giving it greater leeway to vary income tax rates from those in the rest of the UK . The plans would build on the powers devolved under the 2012 Scotland Act , which legislated for an increase in responsibility over taxation from 2016 , in exchange for a 10 % reduction in the grant received from Westminster . The Commission also recommended devolving responsibility in some other fiscal areas , such as the payment of Housing Benefit and the possible levy of a mansion tax in Scotland , but decided against taking charge of other financial matters , including state pensions , National Insurance and tariffs on North Sea oil . Other proposals were to retain the Barnett formula , give Scotland control over its railways , and transfer authority for dissolving parliament and holding elections from Westminster to Holyrood . Lamont described the proposals as " the right balance between fiscal accountability and insuring us against risk " . Ben Thomson , chair of the cross @-@ party Devo Plus think tank argued the plans were " just tinkering with the current system " and would allow the SNP to " say that the unionist parties aren 't interested in real devolution " . Deputy First Minister Sturgeon welcomed the prospect of increased devolution , but said a vote for independence was the only way to ensure greater powers for Scotland as " there [ was ] no guarantee that any new powers would be delivered in the event of a no vote " . The proposals were subsequently endorsed by delegates at Scottish Labour 's 2014 party conference . 
 = = = Free public services debate = = = 
 In September 2012 , Lamont announced a policy review of Scotland 's universal benefits , signalling that a future Labour administration would reverse many of the free services introduced since power was devolved to Scotland . Launching the review at an address to party delegates in Edinburgh , she questioned whether services such as prescriptions and tuition fees — which are free in Scotland — should continue to be available to all , regardless of income , and suggested the situation was unsustainable : " I believe our resources must go to those in greatest need ... Salmond 's most cynical trick was to make people believe that more was free , when the poorest are paying for the tax breaks for the rich ... Scotland cannot be the only something @-@ for @-@ nothing country in the world . " 
 The speech was condemned by the SNP , which branded it as " Blairite " , while deputy party leader Sturgeon called the strategy " disastrous " . The approach was also questioned by Richard Seymour of The Guardian , who suggested it could damage Labour 's electoral appeal : " Outside Scotland , this policy would merely be a gift to the Tories , by corroborating their arguments for welfare cuts . In Scotland , it reminds ex @-@ Labour voters why they defected to the SNP : as a defensive shield against such policies . " Owen Jones of The Independent suggested it was " a baffling political strategy to outflank the SNP from the right " . 
 Lamont returned to the issue of universal tuition fees again in a speech in Glasgow on 17 December 2012 to mark the first anniversary of her election as Labour leader . She suggested that the Graduate Endowment , a system abolished by the SNP Government , could be reinstated if Labour were re @-@ elected at the next Scottish parliamentary election . Ian Grant , a retired college principal , welcomed her comments as " courageous " , but Jamie <unk> , a member of the National Union of Students Scotland expressed concerns that students would be discouraged by extra financial costs on top of loans and other expenses . 
 In January 2014 , Lamont and Scottish Labour faced criticism after the party voted against an SNP motion that included the introduction of free school meals for pupils in their first three years of primary education , and a commitment to childcare for pre @-@ school children . The motion also contained measures that would only be implemented in the event of Scottish independence , something Labour said it could not support . Recalling her experience of teaching underprivileged children , Lamont told the parliament that free school meals would not be her priority , and tabled an unsuccessful amendment calling for greater childcare provisions instead . The motion was later passed by a majority of 67 – 46 . In The Daily Telegraph , Cochrane wrote that the strategy had allowed the SNP to claim Labour opposed the principle of free school meals because they " fell for a bit of skulduggery that Ms Lamont and her business managers should have seen coming a mile off " .

 In 2013 , Labour and Police Scotland launched separate investigations into claims that officials of the Unite union had signed their members up to Labour to get their preferred candidate adopted to represent the party in the Falkirk constituency . The union officials were later cleared of any wrongdoing . It was later claimed that key evidence thought to have been retracted had not been withdrawn , prompting several Falkirk councillors to urge Miliband to publish details of the party 's internal inquiry or to hold a fresh investigation . On the 4 November edition of Good Morning Scotland , Lamont said there was a case for a fresh inquiry , but that Labour does not publish details of its internal investigations . Later the same day , Labour said that it would not be reopening the investigation . Miliband subsequently said that a new investigation was unnecessary . On 8 December the former MSP Karen Whitefield was selected to contest the seat . The report into Labour 's inquiry was leaked to the media in February 2014 , and concluded there was " no doubt " that Unite had attempted to manipulate the selection process . 
 In October 2013 Lamont faced criticism for her reaction to an industrial dispute at the Grangemouth Oil Refinery . Ineos , the company that operates the plant , had stated that the refinery was making financial losses , and had proposed a survival plan requiring employees to accept worse employment terms , notably changes in work rules and less generous pensions ; this the employees rejected . The company mothballed the plant , threatening to close it if the terms were not accepted . Lamont urged Ineos to withdraw its conditions and for both sides to hold talks , while Salmond tried to negotiate an agreement . Union officials eventually agreed not to call a strike for at least three years , and the plant reopened . The Ineos chairman , Calum MacLean , described Lamont 's support for the trade unions during the dispute as " deeply irresponsible " , while Salmond claimed she had been silent throughout the disagreement . Writing for the Dunfermline Press , Natalie McGarry suggested that while the Labour leader 's silence probably had much to do with the continuing Falkirk selection row , ultimately she was " found wanting " .

 Scotland voted by a small majority against independence , but the referendum returned " Yes " votes in some traditional Labour strongholds , particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire , prompting media speculation about Lamont 's future as the party 's leader . Shortly after the referendum , a Daily Mail article claimed that Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy was being lined up to take over from her , while The Herald reported that party delegates concerned about the results had started to view Murphy as a possible successor . Lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at the 25 September 2014 session of First Minister 's Questions , the first of the post @-@ referendum era . " When the First Minister is long gone I will still be doing my job on behalf of the people of Scotland . " Her position remained uncertain . Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats at the 2015 general election without a change of leadership . In October , two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party . McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader , and described the party as " a political machine that is angry about what has happened in Scotland in the recent past " . Shortly afterwards , his predecessor , Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded " enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily " because its supporters no longer understood " what the party stands for " . Margaret Curran , the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland , said that although the party was changing , it needed to reconnect with its " socialist principles " . 
 Lamont 's resignation as Labour leader was reported by media outlets on the evening of 24 October 2014 , following the publication of an interview with the Daily Record in which she announced her intention to step down with immediate effect . She told the newspaper that she was resigning because Labour 's Westminster leadership had undermined her attempts to reform the party in Scotland , and treated Scottish Labour “ like a branch office of London . ” . She described some London @-@ based colleagues as " dinosaurs " unable to understand that " Scotland has changed forever " following the referendum . Lamont was also angry that she had not been consulted on some matters , such as a decision by the UK leadership to replace Ian Price as Scottish Labour 's General Secretary . In her letter of resignation , submitted to Scottish Labour Party Chairman Jamie Glackin , Lamont accused " senior members of the party " of questioning her role and said that she was taking herself " out of the equation " to allow Scottish Labour to have a discussion about the best way forward . Anas Sarwar became Labour 's acting leader . On 26 October , following a meeting of the party 's executive committee , he outlined the details of a leadership election , which would be held using the three @-@ tier electoral college , and conclude with the announcement of a new leader on 13 December . Murphy , Boyack and Neil Findlay stood in the subsequent contest , with Murphy elected as Lamont 's successor . Lamont did not vote for Murphy in the election , but instead chose to back his rivals . 
 Miliband paid tribute to Lamont shortly after she announced that she intended to relinquish the leadership role , saying she had " led the Scottish Labour Party with determination " . McLeish and McConnell both indicated that Lamont 's sudden departure following weeks of speculation could have implications for Miliband 's leadership . McLeish said that Miliband 's chance of becoming Prime Minister could be affected if Labour returned fewer Scottish MPs in 2015 , something he called a problem of “ historic , epic proportions ” , while McConnell said that he was " very , very angry " and suggested Miliband had questions to answer about the circumstances surrounding the resignation . Salmond echoed the views of his predecessor , arguing that Miliband " should be answering questions about why Labour in Scotland is run as an extension of his Westminster office , and why he has effectively forced the resignation of a Labour leader in Scotland . " Ed Balls , the Shadow Chancellor , rejected Lamont 's claims about UK Labour 's treatment of its Scottish counterpart . Ian Davidson claimed that supporters of Murphy , who subsequently announced his intention to stand in the leadership contest to succeed Lamont , had conducted a whispering campaign against her . He further suggested that those on the right of the party had resented her election as leader and ignored her , treating her as a " wee lassie " .

 Labour went on to suffer significant losses , both in the 2015 UK general election , and the 2016 Scottish Parliament election . In Glasgow , where the party had traditionally enjoyed strong support , both elections produced a result in which every Labour held constituency was lost to the SNP , while in 2016 the Conservatives overtook Labour as the second largest party at Holyrood . Lamont lost her Glasgow Pollok seat to the SNP 's <unk> Yousaf , who secured it with a majority of 6 @,@ 484 , but she was one of four Labour candidates elected to the Glasgow regional list , where she was joined by Sarwar , James Kelly and Pauline McNeill . In response to the results , Lamont suggested Labour needed to understand the reasons behind it , and suggested that the 2014 referendum could be partially responsible . " A bit of it , I think , is still the referendum , the Yes / No is the divide in people ’ s minds rather than the politics of taxation , investing in public services against a low tax economy and so on . " 
 = = Politics and views = = 
 Although she has been criticised by SNP politicians for taking a " Blairite " stance on public services , The Guardian 's Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as " rooted to older [ Labour ] party values , with a deep commitment to fairness " . Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching . Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference : " I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times of trying to make a living here . I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love , but one where my mother always reminded me that what we ate , what we wore , where we lived , was all the product of the sweat of my father 's brow earned at sea . And I respected that . " 
 Throughout her career , Lamont has campaigned on issues such as equality and violence against women . Her profile on the Scottish Parliament website lists her political interests as being focussed on tackling poverty , women 's rights and disability issues . She credits Curran , and the work of author Erin <unk> for helping to broaden her understanding of women 's issues . On 12 March 2014 , she led a Scottish Parliament debate in which she discussed the increased opportunities available for women in Scotland , while highlighting issues she felt still needed to be addressed . At First Minister 's Questions she often highlighted personal stories of members of the public , believing them to bring an element of real life into the Parliament . Along with Holyrood 's other opposition leaders , Lamont signed the Equality Network 's Equal Marriage Pledge in favour of legalising same @-@ sex marriage in January 2012 , and voted in favour of the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill on 4 February 2014 . As someone with a Gaelic background , she has spoken of her belief in the importance of providing support for the language , feeling it has an economic benefit for Scotland . On the death of Nelson Mandela in December 2013 , Lamont joined other public figures in paying tribute to him , describing the former South African President as " the towering figure of my life since I became politically aware " . 
 Lamont has said that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament election because the party lost its direction , and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat , it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster . In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement , " We misread the 2010 ( general ) election , thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country – it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti @-@ Tory . There 's an issue about rebuilding trust , and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics . " She told delegates at her party 's 2012 Scottish conference that it was time for them to stop apologising for past mistakes . " We know what happened last May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved . But now , we need to start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs . " 
 In an interview with Scotland on Sunday in September 2013 , Lamont signalled her support for the creation of a land tax as part of reforms to local taxation , suggesting that the council tax freeze introduced by the SNP had resulted in a funding shortfall . At the 2014 Scottish Trades Union Congress annual conference , Lamont outlined plans to establish a Workers ' Charter , saying she would work with the SNP government to achieve this . 
 = = Media image = = 
 After her inaugural session of First Minister 's Questions on 22 December 2011 , the BBC 's Brian Taylor called Lamont 's performance " confident , direct and salient " . Cochrane has suggested that she emerged as the prevailing force at the weekly debates with Salmond , writing in May 2013 , " it 's been obvious for some time to those of us in the cheap seats that Johann Lamont has more than got his measure . " Peter Hetherington of The Guardian quotes an unnamed political observer at Holyrood who said , " She 's getting under [ Salmond 's ] skin like no predecessor . " Writing for The Scotsman as Scottish Labour gathered for its conference in April 2013 , Andrew Whitaker felt that Lamont 's tenure as party leader had been successful , citing Labour 's local election achievements and her weekly exchanges with Salmond at First Minister 's Questions as examples : " Ms Lamont has made Labour at Holyrood respectable again and less of the laughing stock than the ravaged party that emerged from heavy defeat in 2011 . " 
 Her media appearances were criticised for their awkwardness . In September 2012 , Richard Seymour of The Guardian described how she " fluffed her lines " during an interview with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby following her announcement of Labour 's public service policy review . Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview , in which she was repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme . But he describes her in person as " articulate , reflective , self @-@ deprecating and at times very funny . It would be unfair to condemn her for not being a sound @-@ bite politician ; she ought to be applauded for it , but the trouble is we live in a sound @-@ bite age . " Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes , " despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one , [ Lamont ] is actually , really rather entertaining , engaging and wonderfully self @-@ deprecating . " The BBC 's Marianne Taylor describes Lamont as " Quietly spoken and more humorous in person than she comes across on television " . 
 Ian Swanson of The Scotsman has described her as " dour but passionate " . Lamont 's low public recognition indicated by the December 2013 TNS <unk> poll led Herald columnist Alison Rowat to label her " the invisible woman of the independence debate " , and to suggest she needed to raise her profile . Impressionist Jonathan Watson satirised Lamont in the 2013 edition of BBC Scotland 's annual Hogmanay comedy show Only an Excuse ? , featuring a sketch in which she debates Scottish independence with Salmond .

 Lamont 's decision to question the status quo over the availability of free public services for all earned her the Political Impact of the Year award at the 2012 Herald Scottish Politician of the Year Awards . She was also nominated for Politician of the Year at the same ceremony , but beaten by Deputy First Minister Sturgeon .

 = Interest rate parity = 
 Interest rate parity is a no @-@ arbitrage condition representing an equilibrium state under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries . The fact that this condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn <unk> profits from covered interest arbitrage . Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets . Given foreign exchange market equilibrium , the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate @-@ adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets . Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing in a country with a lower interest rate , exchanging for foreign currency , and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate , due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity . Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms : uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk ( unanticipated changes in exchange rates ) is uninhibited , whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover ( eliminate exposure to ) exchange rate risk . Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates : the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate . 
 Economists have found empirical evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds , though not with precision due to the effects of various risks , costs , taxation , and ultimate differences in liquidity . When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold , they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate . This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds , for which economists have found mixed results . When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together , they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity , which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate . This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries . 
 = = Assumptions = = 
 Interest rate parity rests on certain assumptions , the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily exchange domestic assets for foreign assets . The second assumption is that assets have perfect substitutability , following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity . Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability , investors would be expected to hold those assets offering greater returns , be they domestic or foreign assets . However , both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors . Therefore , it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets . That is not to say that domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns , but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision . 
 = = Uncovered interest rate parity = = 
 When the no @-@ arbitrage condition is satisfied without the use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk , interest rate parity is said to be uncovered . Risk @-@ neutral investors will be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the exchange rate between those countries is expected to adjust such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on euro deposits , thereby eliminating the potential for uncovered interest arbitrage profits . Uncovered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the spot exchange rate . The following equation represents uncovered interest rate parity . 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <formula> is the expected future spot exchange rate at time t + k 
 k is the number of periods into the future from time t 
 St is the current spot exchange rate at time t 
 i $ is the interest rate in one country ( for example , the United States ) 
 ic is the interest rate in another country or currency area ( for example , the Eurozone ) 
 The dollar return on dollar deposits , <formula> , is shown to be equal to the dollar return on euro deposits , <formula> . 
 = = = Approximation = = = 
 Uncovered interest rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the interest rate available on dollar deposits , while an investor holding euro deposits will earn the interest rate available in the eurozone , but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar . Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions . If uncovered interest rate parity holds , such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits , then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar . Conversely , some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar . The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation . 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <formula> is the change in the expected future spot exchange rate 
 <formula> is the expected rate of depreciation of the dollar 
 A more universal way of stating the approximation is " the home interest rate equals the foreign interest rate plus the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency . " 
 = = Covered interest rate parity = = 
 When the no @-@ arbitrage condition is satisfied with the use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk , interest rate parity is said to be covered . Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit , thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits . Furthermore , covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate . The following equation represents covered interest rate parity .

 <formula> is the forward exchange rate at time t 
 The dollar return on dollar deposits , <formula> , is shown to be equal to the dollar return on euro deposits , <formula> . 
 = = Empirical evidence = = 
 Covered interest rate parity ( CIRP ) is found to hold when there is open capital mobility and limited capital controls , and this finding is confirmed for all currencies freely traded in the present @-@ day . One such example is when the United Kingdom and Germany abolished capital controls between 1979 and 1981 . Maurice <unk> and Alan Taylor calculated hypothetical profits as implied by the expression of a potential inequality in the CIRP equation ( meaning a difference in returns on domestic versus foreign assets ) during the 1960s and 1970s , which would have constituted arbitrage opportunities if not for the prevalence of capital controls . However , given financial liberalization and resulting capital mobility , arbitrage temporarily became possible until equilibrium was restored . Since the abolition of capital controls in the United Kingdom and Germany , potential arbitrage profits have been near zero . Factoring in transaction costs arising from fees and other regulations , arbitrage opportunities are fleeting or nonexistent when such costs exceed deviations from parity . While CIRP generally holds , it does not hold with precision due to the presence of transaction costs , political risks , tax implications for interest earnings versus gains from foreign exchange , and differences in the liquidity of domestic versus foreign assets . Researchers found evidence that significant deviations from CIRP during the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 were driven by concerns over risk posed by counter parties to banks and financial institutions in Europe and the US in the foreign exchange swap market . The European Central Bank 's efforts to provide US dollar liquidity in the foreign exchange swap market , along with similar efforts by the Federal Reserve , had a moderating impact on CIRP deviations between the dollar and the euro . Such a scenario was found to be reminiscent of deviations from CIRP during the 1990s driven by struggling Japanese banks which looked toward foreign exchange swap markets to try and acquire dollars to bolster their creditworthiness . 
 When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity ( UIRP ) hold , such a condition sheds light on a noteworthy relationship between the forward and expected future spot exchange rates , as demonstrated below . 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 Dividing the equation for UIRP by the equation for CIRP yields the following equation : 
 <formula> 
 which can be rewritten as : 
 <formula> 
 This equation represents the unbiasedness hypothesis , which states that the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate . Given strong evidence that CIRP holds , the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis can serve as a test to determine whether UIRP holds ( in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal , both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold ) . Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis , particularly evidence for <unk> between the forward rate and future spot rate , is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis . 
 UIRP is found to have some empirical support in tests for correlation between expected rates of currency depreciation and the forward premium or discount . Evidence suggests that whether UIRP holds depends on the currency examined , and deviations from UIRP have been found to be less substantial when examining longer time horizons . Some studies of monetary policy have offered explanations for why UIRP fails empirically . Researchers demonstrated that if a central bank manages interest rate spreads in strong response to the previous period 's spreads , that interest rate spreads had negative coefficients in regression tests of UIRP . Another study which set up a model wherein the central bank 's monetary policy responds to exogenous shocks , that the central bank 's smoothing of interest rates can explain empirical failures of UIRP . A study of central bank interventions on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited evidence of any substantial effect on deviations from UIRP . UIRP has been found to hold over very small spans of time ( covering only a number of hours ) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data . Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes , using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound , have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile , and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility . 
 = = Real interest rate parity = = 
 When both UIRP ( particularly in its approximation form ) and purchasing power parity ( PPP ) hold , the two parity conditions together reveal a relationship among expected real interest rates , wherein changes in expected real interest rates reflect expected changes in the real exchange rate . This condition is known as real interest rate parity ( RIRP ) and is related to the international Fisher effect . The following equations demonstrate how to derive the RIRP equation . 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <formula> represents inflation 
 If the above conditions hold , then they can be combined and rearranged as the following : 
 <formula> 
 RIRP rests on several assumptions , including efficient markets , no country risk premia , and zero change in the expected real exchange rate . The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage . There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan . The half @-@ life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months , but between two and three months for certain countries . Such variation in the half @-@ lives of deviations may be reflective of differences in the degree of financial integration among the country groups analyzed . RIRP does not hold over short time horizons , but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years .

 " Born Again " is the twenty @-@ second episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on April 22 , 1994 . " Born Again " was written by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa , and directed by Jerrold Freedman . The episode featured guest appearances by Brian Markinson and Maggie Wheeler . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Born Again " earned a Nielsen household rating of 8 @.@ 2 , being watched by 7 @.@ 7 million households in its initial broadcast , and received mixed reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . When Mulder and Scully are called to New York to investigate the death of a police officer , they come to believe that a young girl present at the incident may be the reincarnation of another officer murdered years earlier . 
 Several crew members disliked the episode , most notably writer Howard Gordon and David Duchovny . Gordon felt that the episode was too similar to the other episodes that had been aired , whereas Duchovny bluntly stated that he " detested " the episode . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Buffalo , New York , police detective Sharon Lazard finds a little girl , Michelle Bishop , alone in an alley . Lazard takes the seemingly lost girl into her precinct , and leaves her alone to be interviewed by another detective , Rudolph Barbala . However , moments later , Barbala is jettisoned through a window , falling to his death . 
 Lazard turns to Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help . She tells them of Michelle 's claims that a man had attacked Barbala , even though she was the only person in the room when the detective was killed . The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite ; the computer seemingly glitches , displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer . The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris — who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit . The agents speak to Michelle 's psychiatrist , Dr. Braun , who tells them that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together , removing the same eye and arm each time ; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris ' death . 
 The agents interview Barbala 's partner , Tony Fiore , who attributes Morris ' death to a triad gang they had been investigating together . Later that day , Fiore meets with a Leon Felder , and the two discuss claiming a large sum of money from a safety deposit box , but agree that they haven 't waited the ten years they had intended to , ominously discussing that they are the last two claimants left . That night , Felder gets off a bus , but his tie catches in the door as it drives off . The driver tries to brake , but the bus inexplicably continues to accelerate , strangling Felder as Michelle watches from inside the bus . 
 Investigating further , Mulder and Scully learn that Fiore , Barbala , Felder and Morris had all worked closely together in the past . They also find that Fiore 's wife Anita keeps a collection of origami animals made by her first husband — Charlie Morris . Anita tells the agents that Fiore hasn 't returned home from the previous night ; meanwhile , the agents find that pages are missing from the file on Morris ' murder , and Fiore was the last one to have checked the file out . 
 Michelle undergoes a session of regression hypnosis , where she claims to be twenty @-@ four years old . She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her , and the session is ended . Mulder reviews the video of the session , and is convinced that the girl is the reincarnation of Morris , having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered . The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming , which Mulder has an expert clean up . The noise is found to contain a grainy image of what appears to be a fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit . Meanwhile , Scully has tracked down Morris ' autopsy findings , which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract , indicating he died of drowning . The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore 's house . 
 Rushing to Fiore 's house , Mulder and Scully find Michelle using telekinetic powers to try to kill Fiore . They prevent her from doing so , and Fiore confesses that he , Felder and Barbala had stolen a large sum of money , intending to keep it safe for ten years before claiming it . Morris learned of their plan and threatened to report on them , and was consequently killed to silence him . However , Fiore maintains that he never wanted to see Morris dead and only wanted to take care of Anita after his death . Michelle uses her powers to destroy the fish @-@ tank , but spares Fiore after hearing pleas from Anita not to hurt him . Later , Fiore pleads guilty to charges of murder and grand larceny , whilst Michelle seemingly recovers and goes on to become a normal little girl .

David Duchovny also reportedly " detested " the episode , despite a guest appearance by his then @-@ girlfriend Maggie Wheeler . 
 Executive producer R. W. Goodwin recalls being on location for the episode 's opening scene , in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window . The room used for the scene had two windows side @-@ by @-@ side , and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt . When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it , the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out .

 Writer Howard Gordon has expressed his disappointment with the episode , feeling that it was too similar to his earlier work on the episode " Shadows " , and finding that it was " not done particularly interestingly " . Series creator Chris Carter also felt that " Born Again " was " just not one of [ his ] favorites " , adding that he " thought the direction was a little sloppy , but it 's one of those episodes that plays a little closer to reality and I like that about it " . 
 In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly , " Born Again " was rated a B − , with the episode being described as " engaging but ultimately just serviceable " , although Andrea Libman 's casting as Michelle was called " inspired " . Zack Handlen , writing for The A.V. Club , felt negatively towards the episode , feeling that its plot was too reminiscent of earlier episodes , such as " Eve " or " Shadows " . However , he found the scene in which an image is found in the static of a video recording to have been a highlight , calling it " a cool combination of hard science and the inexplicable " . Matt Haigh , writing for Den of Geek , was favorable towards the episode , again praising the performance of Libman as Michelle . He also drew comparisons to " Shadows " , but felt that " Born Again " was the better episode of the two .

 Oviri ( Tahitian : Savage or wild ) is an 1894 ceramic sculpture by French artist Paul Gauguin , the original cast is in the Musée d 'Orsay . Gauguin shows her with long pale hair and large wild eyes . In Tahitian mythology Oviri was the goddess of mourning . Gauguin shows her either smothering or embracing a wolf with her feet , as she tightly clutches another wolf cub in her arms . Art historians have presented multiple interpretations of the work ; usually that he intended it as an epithet to reinforce his self @-@ image as a " civilised savage " . Tahitian goddesses of her era had passed from folk memory by 1894 , yet Gauguin <unk> the island 's past as he reaches towards more ancient sources , including an Assyrian relief of a ' master of animals ' type and Majapahit mummies . Other possible influences include preserved skulls from the Marquesas Islands , figures found at Borobudur , and a 9th @-@ century Mahayana Buddhist temple in central Java . 
 Gauguin made three casts in 1894 , each in partially glazed stoneware . Several other copies exist in plaster or bronze . His sale of the casts were not successful , and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked that for one of the reproductions to act as a marker for his grave . A cast was not placed there until 1973 . There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure : on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of the Oviri figure he made to Stéphane Mallarmé where he called the figure a strange and cruel enigma ; in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard where he referred to it as La <unk> ( " The Murderess " ) ; and in a c . 1899 drawing where he appends an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac 's novel Séraphîta . Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d 'Automne ( no . 57 ) where it influenced Pablo Picasso , who based one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d 'Avignon on it .

 Gauguin was foremost a painter ; he came to ceramics around 1886 , when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet . They had been introduced by Félix <unk> who , inspired by the new French art pottery , was experimenting with the form . During that winter of 1886 – 87 , Gauguin visited Chaplet 's workshop at Vaugirard , where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles . 
 Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 , and attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women undertook a set of sculptural mask @-@ like portraits on paper . They evoke both melancholy and death , and conjure the state of <unk> ( brooding or melancholy ) ; imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic . Gauguin 's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived . 
 He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894 , during his return from Tahiti , and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux @-@ Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year . There are two versions of what ensued : Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was " literally expelled " from the exhibition ; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest . According to Danielsson , Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir , bemoaning the state of modern ceramics . 
 At the outset of 1897 , Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze . Gauguin 's response centered on Oviri : 
 I believe that my large statue in ceramic , the <unk> ( " The Murderess " ) , is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that , in addition , it would look very well cast in bronze ( without retouching and without patina ) . In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself , but also a bronze edition with which to make money . 
 Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three plaster casts , the fissured surfaces of which suggest that they were taken from a prior undocumented wood carving no longer extant . One was given to Daniel Monfreid and now belongs to the Musée départemental Maurice Denis " The Priory " in Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye . Another version in plaster , with the surface finish of wood , was kept by Gustave Fayet , and subsequently formed part of the collection of his son , Léon . The third version was kept by the artist who made the casts . A number of bronzes were produced , including the version placed on Gauguin 's grave at <unk> , cast by the Foundation Singer @-@ <unk> and erected 29 March 1973 . 
 = = Description and sources = = 
 Oviri has long blonde or grey hair reaching to her knees . Her head and eyes are disproportionately large , she has adolescent breasts , while the aperture at the back of her head resembles a vaginal orifice . She holds a wolf cub to her hip , a symbol of her indifference and wild power . It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub , but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice , infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother , influenced by Eugène Delacroix 's 1838 painting , Medea About to Kill Her Children . A second animal , likely another wolf , is at her feet either curling in submission or dead . Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin . 
 The association between the woman and a wolf stems from a remark Edgar Degas made defending Gauguin 's work at the poorly received 1893 Durand @-@ Ruel exhibition , when Degas quoted La Fontaine 's fable The Dog and the Wolf , which is usually taken as implying that freedom should not be exchanged for comfort or financial gain : " You see , Gauguin is the wolf . " In Oviri , the mature wolf , the European Gauguin , perishes while the whelp , the Gauguin of Tahiti , survives . 
 The Tahitian myths had largely disappeared by Gauguin 's time ( he based his own accounts on other sources without acknowledgement ) , as had most artefacts associated with that culture . His representation of Oviri is largely a work of imagination , informed by a collection of what he described as his " little world of friends " and which he took with him to Tahiti on his first visit . These included Odilon Redon 's lithograph La Mort , photographs of subjects such as a temple frieze at Borobudur , Java , and an Egyptian fresco from an <unk> dynasty tomb at Thebes . Other sources that have been suggested include an Assyrian relief of Gilgamesh clutching a lion cub now in the Louvre , and a Majapahit terracotta figure from the Djakarta museum . 
 Oviri 's head seems based on mummified skulls of chieftains in the Marquesas Islands , whose eye sockets were traditionally encrusted with mother @-@ of @-@ pearl and worshiped as divine . Elements of her body may draw from <unk> images of fecundity . Thus life and death were evoked in the same image . In a letter to Mallarmé trying to raise a public subscription to purchase the work , Morice titled the sculpture Diane <unk> ( " Diana the Huntress " ) , an allusion to the ancient Greek goddess Diana of the hunt , moon and childbirth . He made the same reference in his poems on Oviri . Barbara Landy interprets the life and death theme as indicating Gauguin 's need to abandon his civilised ego in a return to the natural state of the primitive savage . The work is related to the 1889 ceramic Black Venus , which shows a woman kneeling over a decapitated head resembling the artist . 
 Nancy <unk> Mathews believes the creatures in her arms and at her feet are actually foxes , animals Gauguin had used in his 1889 wood carving Be in Love , You Will Be Happy and in his 1891 Pont @-@ Aven oil painting The Loss of Virginity . In an 1889 letter to Émile Bernard , he described the Soyez amoureuses fox as an " Indian symbol of perversity " . There is a long tradition in Asian folklore of foxes having the power to transform into women ( for example in Japanese Yōkai or Kitsune folklore ) . 
 Gauguin depicts the Oviri figure in at least one drawing , two watercolor transfer <unk> and two woodcuts . It is possible that the woodcuts were created in Pont @-@ Aven in the summer of 1894 ; before the ceramic . The last to appear is probably the drawing in what is apparently the first issue of Gauguin 's Papeete broadsheet Le Sourire " ( The Smile : A Serious Newspaper ) " published between August 1899 and April 1900 . It was accompanied by the inscription " Et le <unk> , <unk> sa <unk> , <unk> de sa <unk> des <unk> <unk> pour <unk> Séraphitus @-@ Séraphita " ( And the monster , embracing its creation , filled her generous womb with seed and fathered Séraphitus @-@ Séraphita ) . Séraphitus @-@ Séraphita is an allusion to Honoré de Balzac 's novel Séraphîta which features an androgynous hero . In this first issue of Le Sourire , he reviewed a local <unk> author 's play by that dealt with incest ( among other themes ) , and invokes ' Séraphitus @-@ Séraphita ' . The review congratulated the play 's " savage author " and ended with a plea for women 's liberation through the abolition of marriage . The accompanying drawing is distinctly androgynous . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 Art historians have put forward various theories as to the seeming multiplicity of meanings inherent in Gauguin 's representation . Most obviously the figure invokes Tahitian legend and themes of death and superstition . It reflects the artist 's view of female sexuality ; a common motif in 19th century art was the connection between long , wild hair and evil femininity . Related is the delight Gauguin took from its alternative title " savage " and the implications of a brutal , bloodthirsty deity , which seems to refer as much to himself as the goddess . 
 = = = Tahiti deity = = = 
 Gauguin 's figure seems to invoke the Polynesian goddess Hina , depicted by Morice as a Diana @-@ like deity clutching a wolf cub , " monstrous and majestic , drunk with pride , rage and sorrow " . He titled an 1894 self @-@ portrait in plaster as Oviri . The original is lost but a number of bronze casts survive . He used double mirrors to capture his familiar Inca profile , the result reprising his Jug in the Form of a Head , Self @-@ Portrait . This was one of the earliest occasions Gauguin applied the term Oviri to himself . " Gauguin sometimes also referred to himself as Oviri , the savage ... " , writes <unk> <unk> . The Stuttgart version of his 1892 oil painting E <unk> oe i <unk> ( Where Are You Going ? ) depicts a woman clutching a wolf cub . Pollitt remarks that this stocky , sculptural and androgynous figure gives a first glimpse of Oviri . 
 Oviri was the title of a favourite Tahitian song – a melancholy tune of love and longing that mentions the subject 's " savage , restless heart " . It recounts the love between two women for each other , both of whom have grown silent and cold . Gauguin translated the verse in his series of romanticised journal Noa Noa ( Tahitian for " fragrance " , a written project he undertook to examine his Tahitian experience , which he accompanied with a series of ten woodcuts ) ; the only one of his songs reprinted in the Tahitian newspaper La <unk> when he became editor . Danielsson believes the song echoes Gauguin 's dual attachment to his Danish wife Mette and his then <unk> ( Tahitian for " woman " ) <unk> <unk> , his young native wife and the focal point of Noa Noa . 
 = = = Colonial experience = = = 
 Noa Noa contains an account of a journey into the mountains with a young man whom he eventually understands as sexless , leading him to meditate on the " androgynous side of the savage " in his manuscript . Ben Pollitt notes that in Tahitian culture the craftsman / artist , neither warrior / hunter nor homemaker / carer , was conceived <unk> , an ambiguous gender position that appealed to Gauguin 's subversive nature . Taylor believes Morice may have been describing Gauguin in his 1897 poem Shining Hina of the Woods as part of two long extracts from their collaboration on Noa Noa . Gray views the sculpture as representing " the expression of Gauguin 's profound disillusionment and discouragement " . 
 Noa Noa is part of Gauguin 's documentation of his experiences as a colonial visitor to Tahiti in 1891 – 1893 . He first used the term " Noa Noa " to describe the scent of Tahitian women : " A mingled perfume , half animal , half vegetable emanated from them ; the perfume of their blood and of the gardenia <unk> , which they wore in their hair " . On his return to Paris in 1893 , Gauguin was apprehensive about exhibiting his Tahitian works . Noa Noa was to provide the context necessary for the public to comprehend the new motifs presented at his Durand @-@ Ruel exhibition . It was not , however , completed in time for the opening of the exhibition . 
 = = = Self portrait = = = 
 Gauguin asked that Oviri be placed on his grave , which seems to indicate that he saw the figure as his alter ego and the fox as changeable in its gender as he was ( according to Mathews ) and thus symbolic of dangerous sexuality . A number of sources indicate that Gauguin was suffering at the time from a syphilitic rash that prevented him from travelling to Tahiti for several months . She suggests the orifice is a pars pro toto for the woman who infected him . 
 The anthropologist Paul van der <unk> believes Oviri was intended as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin 's persona as a " civilised savage " . The artist wrote in his final letter to Morice that " You were wrong that day when you said I was wrong to say I was a savage . It 's true enough : I am a savage . And civilised people sense the fact . In my work there is nothing that can surprise or disconcert , except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself . That 's also why my work is inimitable . " 
 = = Reception and influence = = 
 Whether or not the sculpture was to be exhibited at the Salon de la Nationale , it was scheduled for the café proprietor Lévy at 57 rue Saint @-@ Lazare , with whom Gauguin had concluded an agreement to represent him before his last departure for Tahiti . It failed to sell , and Charles Morice was unable to raise public money to acquire it for the nation . Gauguin had thought his only likely interested patron would be Gustave Fayet , who did eventually buy it for 1 @,@ 500 francs , but in 1905 , after Gauguin 's death . 
 Gauguin was celebrated by the Parisian avant @-@ garde after the posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d 'Automne in 1903 and 1906 . The power evoked by his work lead directly to Les Demoiselles d 'Avignon in 1907 . According to David Sweetman , Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco <unk> in Paris . <unk> was a friend of Gauguin and held several of his works in an attempt to help his poverty @-@ stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris . 
 Art historian John Richardson writes : 
 The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin 's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist 's thrall . Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art — not to speak of elements from metaphysics , ethnology , symbolism , the Bible , classical myths , and much else besides — could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless . An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty , he demonstrated , by harnessing his demons to the dark gods ( not necessarily Tahitian ones ) and tapping a new source of divine energy . 
 Both Sweetman and Richardson point to the Gauguin Oviri as a major influence . First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d 'Automne retrospective , it was probably a direct influence on Les Demoiselles . Sweetman writes , " Gauguin 's statue Oviri , which was prominently displayed in 1906 , was to stimulate Picasso 's interest in both sculpture and ceramics , while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in printmaking , though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso 's art would take . This interest would culminate in the seminal Les Demoiselles d 'Avignon . " 
 In 2006 , a bronze version of Oviri sold at Christie 's New York for US $ 251 @,@ 200 .

 = German battleship Gneisenau = 
 Gneisenau was a German capital ship , alternatively described as a battleship and battlecruiser , of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine . She was the second vessel of her class , which included one other ship , Scharnhorst . The ship was built at the Deutsche Werke dockyard in Kiel ; she was laid down on 6 May 1935 and launched on 8 December 1936 . Completed in May 1938 , the ship was armed with a main battery of nine 28 cm ( 11 in ) C / 34 guns in three triple turrets , though there were plans to replace these weapons with six 38 cm ( 15 in ) SK C / 34 guns in twin turrets . 
 Gneisenau and Scharnhorst operated together for much of the early portion of World War II , including sorties into the Atlantic to raid British merchant shipping . During their first operation , the two ships sank the British auxiliary cruiser HMS Rawalpindi in a short battle . Gneisenau and Scharnhorst participated in Operation Weserübung , the German invasion of Norway . During operations off Norway , the two ships engaged the battlecruiser HMS Renown and sank the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious . Gneisenau was damaged in the action with Renown and later torpedoed by a British submarine , HMS Clyde , off Norway . After a successful raid in the Atlantic in 1941 , Gneisenau and her sister put in at Brest , France . The two battleships were the subject of repeated bombing raids by the RAF ; Gneisenau was hit several times during the raids , though she was ultimately repaired . 
 In early 1942 , the two ships made a daylight dash up the English Channel from occupied France to Germany . After reaching Kiel in early February , the ship went into drydock . On the night of 26 February , the British launched an air attack on the ship ; one bomb penetrated her armored deck and exploded in the forward ammunition magazine , causing serious damage and a large number of casualties . The repairs necessitated by the damage were so time consuming that it was determined to rebuild the ship to accommodate the 38 cm guns as originally intended . The 28 cm guns were removed and used as shore batteries . In 1943 , Hitler ordered the cessation of conversion work , and on 27 March 1945 , she was sunk as a blockship in Gotenhafen ( Gdynia ) in German @-@ occupied Poland . She was eventually broken up for scrap in 1951 . 
 = = Construction and configuration = = 
 Gneisenau was ordered as Ersatz Hessen as a replacement for the old pre @-@ dreadnought Hessen , under the contract name " E. " The Deutsche Werke in Kiel was awarded the contract , where the keel was laid on 6 May 1935 . The ship was launched on 8 December 1936 , after which fitting @-@ out work was begun . The ship was completed in May 1938 and commissioned for sea trials on the 21st , under the command of Kapitän zur See ( KzS ) Erich <unk> . The trials revealed a dangerous tendency to ship considerable amounts of water in heavy seas . This caused flooding in the bow and damaged electrical systems in the forward gun turret . As a result , she went back to the dockyard for extensive modification of the bow . The original straight stem was replaced with a raised " Atlantic bow . " A diagonal cap was fitted to the smoke stack to keep the main mast free of smoke . The modifications were completed by September 1939 , by which time the ship was finally fully operational . 
 Gneisenau displaced 32 @,@ 100 long tons ( 32 @,@ 600 t ) as built and 38 @,@ 100 long tons ( 38 @,@ 700 t ) fully loaded , with a length of 234 @.@ 9 m ( 770 ft 8 in ) , a beam of 30 m ( 98 ft 5 in ) and a maximum draft of 9 @.@ 9 m ( 32 ft 6 in ) . She was powered by three Germania geared steam turbines , which developed a total of 165 @,@ 930 metric horsepower ( 163 @,@ 660 shp ; 122 @,@ 041 kW ) and yielded a maximum speed of 31 @.@ 3 knots ( 58 @.@ 0 km / h ; 36 @.@ 0 mph ) on speed trials . Her standard crew numbered 56 officers and 1 @,@ 613 enlisted men , though during the war this was augmented up to 60 officers and 1 @,@ 780 men . While serving as a squadron flagship , Gneisenau carried an additional ten officers and 61 enlisted men . 
 She was armed with nine 28 cm ( 11 @.@ 1 in ) L / 54 @.@ 5 guns arranged in three triple gun turrets : two superfiring turrets forward — Anton and Bruno — and one aft — Caesar . Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 55 guns , fourteen 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L / 65 and sixteen 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) L / 83 , and initially ten 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns . The number of 2 cm guns was eventually increased to thirty @-@ eight . Six 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) above @-@ water torpedo tubes , taken from the light cruisers Nürnberg and Leipzig , were installed in 1942 .

 Gneisenau left Germany for a round of trials in the Atlantic in June 1939 . As it was peacetime , the ship carried primarily practice ammunition , with only a small number of live rounds . She was back in Germany when war began in September 1939 . On the 4th , the day after the British declaration of war , Gneisenau was attacked by fourteen Wellington bombers , though they made no hits . In November , KzS <unk> was replaced by KzS Harald <unk> . The ship 's first combat operation , under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Marschall , began on 21 November 1939 ; the ship , in company with her sister Scharnhorst , the light cruiser Köln , and nine destroyers , was to patrol the area between Iceland and the Faroe Islands . The intent of the operation was to draw out British units and ease the pressure on the heavy cruiser Admiral Graf Spee , which was being pursued in the South Atlantic . Two days later , the German flotilla intercepted the auxiliary cruiser Rawalpindi . 
 Scharnhorst fired first , followed by Gneisenau eight minutes later . The ship was quickly reduced to a burning wreck ; Marschall ordered Scharnhorst to pick up survivors while he stood by in Gneisenau . The cruiser Newcastle arrived on the scene , which prompted Marschall to halt rescue operations and flee . Four allied capital ships , the British Hood , Nelson , Rodney , and the French Dunkerque followed in pursuit . The Germans reached Wilhelmshaven on 27 November , and on the trip both battleships incurred significant damage from heavy seas and winds . After returning to Kiel , Gneisenau went into drydock for repairs for the storm damage . During the repairs , the bow was remodeled a second time to incorporate additional flare and sheer , in an attempt to improve her seaworthiness . Gneisenau went into the Baltic for trials on 15 January 1940 , after the completion of the refit . Her voyage back to the North Sea was blocked by ice in the Kiel Canal until 4 February . 
 = = = Operation Weserübung = = = 
 Gneisenau was assigned to the forces participating in Operation Weserübung , the invasion of Denmark and Norway . She and her sister were the covering force for the assaults on Narvik and Trondheim ( Flag Officer <unk> Admiral Günther Lütjens ) . The two ships left Wilhelmshaven on the morning of 7 April , along with the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper and fourteen destroyers . The cruiser and destroyers carried the assault forces for Narvik and Trondheim , while Gneisenau and Scharnhorst provided cover for them . Later that day , at around 14 : 30 , the three ships came under attack by a force of British bombers , though the bombers failed to make any hits . On the morning of 8 April , the destroyer Z11 Bernd von Arnim encountered the British destroyer Glowworm . Before being sunk , Glowworm rammed Admiral Hipper , though the latter was not seriously damaged . The crews of the two battleships went to battle stations , though they did not take part in the brief engagement . At 21 : 00 , Gneisenau and Scharnhorst took up a position west of the Vestfjorden to provide distant cover to both of the landings at Narvik and Trondheim . 
 At 04 : 30 on the 9th , Gneisenau located the British battlecruiser Renown with her Seetakt radar ; the call to battle stations rang out on both Gneisenau and Scharnhorst , though it was Renown that fired first , at 05 : 05 . Gneisenau scored two hits on Renown ; the first failed to explode and the second exploded on her upper deck and damaged the radio equipment . Gneisenau and Scharnhorst then turned to disengage . Almost simultaneously , two of Renown 's 15 in ( 38 @.@ 1 cm ) shells struck Gneisenau . One shell hit the director tower and passed through it without exploding ; regardless , it cut several cables and killed one officer and five enlisted men . The second shell disabled the rear turret . This prompted Gneisenau to cease firing and increase speed in order to break away from Renown . Vice Admiral Wilhelm Marschall feared that the destroyers escorting Renown could be used to make torpedo attacks against his unescorted battleships . In the course of the action , Gneisenau fired sixty 28 cm and eight 15 cm rounds . During the high @-@ speed escape , both Gneisenau and Scharnhorst were flooded by significant quantities of water over their bows , which caused problems in both of their forward gun turrets . 
 Admiral Hipper rejoined the two battleships off Trondheim on the morning of 11 April , and the three ships returned to Wilhelmshaven , arriving the following day . There , the damage incurred during the engagement with Renown was repaired . She was then drydocked in Bremerhaven for periodic maintenance on 26 – 29 April . The ship was to go to the Baltic following the completion of repairs , but on the morning of 5 May , while steaming at 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) off the Elbe estuary , Gneisenau detonated a magnetic mine about 21 m ( 68 ft 11 in ) off the port rear quarter and 24 m ( 78 ft 9 in ) below the hull . The explosion caused significant damage to the hull and flooded several compartments , which caused the ship to take on a half @-@ degree list to port . The concussive shock from the blast damaged many internal and topside components , including the starboard low @-@ pressure turbine and the rear rangefinders . Repairs were effected in a floating drydock in Kiel from 6 to 21 May . A brief shakedown cruise followed in the Baltic , and by the 27th , she was back in Kiel at full combat readiness . 
 Gneisenau and Scharnhorst left Wilhelmshaven on 4 June to return to Norway . They were joined by Admiral Hipper and four destroyers . The purpose of the sortie was to interrupt Allied resupply efforts to the Norwegians and to relieve the pressure on German troops fighting in Norway . On 7 June , the squadron rendezvoused with the tanker <unk> to refuel Admiral Hipper and the four destroyers . The next day , the trawler Juniper was discovered and sunk , along with the oil tanker Oil Pioneer . The Germans then launched their Arado 196 float planes to search for more Allied vessels . Admiral Hipper and the destroyers were sent to destroy Orama , a 19 @,@ 500 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 19 @,@ 800 t ) passenger ship , while Atlantis , a hospital ship , was allowed to proceed unmolested . Admiral Marschall detached Admiral Hipper and the four destroyers to refuel in Trondheim , while he would steam to the Harstad area . 
 At 17 : 45 , the German battleships spotted the British aircraft carrier Glorious and two escorting destroyers , Ardent and Acasta , at a range of some 50 @,@ 000 m ( 55 @,@ 000 yd ) . Scharnhorst was closer and therefore fired first . Scharnhorst had some boiler difficulty , which reduced her speed to 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) . This allowed Gneisenau to overtake her sister during the action . Although the destroyers attempted to cover Glorious with smoke screens , the German battleships used their Seetakt radar to assist the gunlaying . In less than an hour 's shooting , Glorious was reduced to a burning hulk . Gneisenau then turned her fire on Acasta , while Scharnhorst dispatched Ardent . Before Acasta was sunk , she fired a spread of torpedoes at Gneisenau , which the latter successfully evaded . One of them struck Scharnhorst , however , and caused serious damage . After all three British ships had been sunk , Marschall withdrew his force to Trondheim to conduct emergency repairs to Scharnhorst . In the meantime , Marschall sortied with Gneisenau , Admiral Hipper , and four destroyers , though after two days he returned to Trondheim when it became clear that the British convoys were too heavily guarded . 
 Admiral Günther Lütjens replaced Marschall as the commander of the squadron , and on 20 June he sortied with Gneisenau , Admiral Hipper , and four destroyers in the direction of Iceland . His intention was to give the impression he was attempting to break out into the Atlantic , to draw British attention away from Scharnhorst as she made the return voyage to Germany . About 40 nmi ( 74 km ; 46 mi ) northwest of <unk> , however , the submarine Clyde torpedoed Gneisenau . The torpedo hit the ship in the bow , just forward of the splinter belt , and caused serious damage . The ship took on a significant amount of water in the two forward watertight compartments , and she was forced to return to Trondheim at reduced speed . In Trondheim , the repair ship <unk> effected temporary repairs that permitted the ship to return to Kiel on 25 – 27 July , escorted by Admiral Hipper , Nürnberg , four destroyers , and six torpedo boats . A strong force from the British Home Fleet attempted to intercept the flotilla , but it failed to find it . Upon arrival , Gneisenau went into drydock at the Howaldtswerke dockyard for five months of repair work . In August , the ship 's commander was replaced by KzS Otto Fein , who would captain the ship for the majority of her active wartime career . 
 = = = Operation Berlin = = = 
 Scharnhorst joined Gneisenau , in preparation for Operation Berlin , the planned breakout into the Atlantic Ocean designed to wreak havoc on the Allied shipping lanes . Severe storms caused damage to Gneisenau , though Scharnhorst was undamaged . The two ships were forced to put into port during the storm : Gneisenau went to Kiel for repairs while Scharnhorst put into Gdynia ( Gotenhafen ) . Repairs were quickly completed , and on 22 January 1941 , the two ships , again under the command of Admiral Lütjens , left port for the North Atlantic . They were detected in the Skagerrak and the heavy units of the British Home Fleet deployed to cover the passage between Iceland and the Faroes . The Germans ' radar detected the British at long range , which allowed Lütjens to avoid the British patrols , with the aid of a squall . By 3 February , the two battleships had evaded the last British cruiser patrol , and had broken into the open Atlantic . 
 On 6 February , the two ships refueled from the tanker Schlettstadt south of Cape Farewell . Shortly after 08 : 30 on 8 February , lookouts spotted convoy HX @-@ 106 , though it was escorted by the battleship Ramillies . Lütjens ' orders prohibited him from engaging Allied capital ships , and so the attack was called off . Scharnhorst 's commander , KzS Hoffmann , however , closed to 23 @,@ 000 m ( 25 @,@ 000 yd ) in an attempt to lure Ramillies away from the convoy so that Gneisenau could attack the convoy . Lütjens ordered Hoffmann to rejoin the flagship immediately . The two battleships steamed off to the northwest to search for more shipping . On 22 February , the pair spotted an empty convoy sailing west , though it dispersed at the appearance of the battleships . Gneisenau sank three ships , and along with a fourth destroyed by Scharnhorst , the pair accounted for 25 @,@ 784 GRT of Allied shipping . 
 Lütjens then decided to move to a new area , as the surviving members of the dispersed convoy had sent distress signals . He chose the Cape Town @-@ Gibraltar convoy route , and positioned himself to the northwest of Cape Verde . The two ships encountered another convoy , escorted by the battleship Malaya , on 8 March . Lütjens again forbade an attack , though he shadowed the convoy and directed U @-@ boats to attack it . A pair of U @-@ boats sank a total of 28 @,@ 488 GRT of shipping on the night of 7 – 8 March . Malaya turned on the two battleships and closed to 24 @,@ 000 m ( 26 @,@ 000 yd ) , well within the range of the Germans ' guns , but Lütjens refused to be drawn into an engagement . He instead turned toward the mid @-@ Atlantic , where the two ships refueled from the tankers Uckermark and Ermland on 12 March . 
 On 15 March , the two battleships , with the two tankers in company , encountered a dispersed convoy in the mid @-@ Atlantic . Gneisenau captured three tankers and sank a fourth , totaling 20 @,@ 139 GRT of shipping . The next day , stragglers from a convoy were sighted . Gneisenau sank seven ships for 26 @,@ 693 GRT , while her sister accounted for six vessels for 35 @,@ 088 long tons ( 35 @,@ 651 t ) . One of the surviving ships radioed the location of the German battleships , which summoned the powerful British battleships Rodney and King George V. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau used their high speed to escape in a squall , and the intervention by the British battleships convinced Lütjens that the chances of further success were small . He therefore decided to head for Brest in occupied France , which the ships reached on 22 March . She then entered drydock for periodic maintenance . 
 = = = Air attacks in Brest = = = 
 After arriving in Brest , Gneisenau was the subject of repeated British air raids . The first attack took place on the night of 30 – 31 March , and a second occurred on 4 – 5 April . During the second raid , a 227 kg ( 500 lb ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) bomb narrowly missed the ship . As a result of the attacks , the ship was moved out of the dry dock and moved to the harbor . On 6 April , the ship was attacked by British torpedo bombers , which managed to score a single hit . The Bristol Beaufort that struck the ship was piloted by Flying Officer Kenneth Campbell . The torpedo struck Gneisenau in the vicinity of the rear main battery turret . Some 3 @,@ 050 t ( 3 @,@ 000 long tons ) of water flooded the ship and caused a 2 degree list to starboard . The flooding also disabled several components of the ship 's propulsion system . The explosion caused significant destruction to the side plating as well as the starboard and centerline propeller shafts . The concussive shock also caused widespread damage to the ship 's electronic components . A salvage tug came alongside to assist in the pumping effort . Following the attack , Gneisenau returned to the drydock for repairs . 
 Three days later , on the night of 9 – 10 April , several British bombers dropped around 25 t ( 25 long tons ) of 227 kg AP bombs on the ship , four of which hit . All four hit the starboard side of the forward superstructure . Two of the bombs exploded on the main armor deck while the other two failed to detonate . The attack killed 72 initially and wounded 90 , of which 16 later died of their injuries . The bombs slightly damaged the main armor deck and caused some structural damage on the starboard side . It was decided to make alterations to the ship while she was drydocked for repairs ; these included the installation of fourteen additional 2 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns and six 53 @.@ 3 cm torpedo tubes amidships . The aircraft hangar was rearranged , and the catapult that had been mounted on top of it was removed . The length of repairs and modifications precluded participation in Operation Rheinübung , the sortie by the new battleship Bismarck in May 1941 . The British continued to attack the ship in drydock , though no further damage was done . On 6 February 1942 , a bomb fell close to the ship , but caused no damage . 
 = = = Operation Cerberus = = = 
 On 12 January 1942 , the German Naval Command , in a conference with Hitler , made the decision to return Gneisenau , Scharnhorst , and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen to Germany . The intention was to deploy the vessels to Norway to interdict Allied convoys to the Soviet Union . The so @-@ called " Channel Dash " , codenamed Operation Cerberus , would avoid the increasingly effective Allied radar and patrol aircraft in the Atlantic . Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax was given command of the operation . In early February , minesweepers swept a route through the English Channel , though the British failed to detect the activity . 
 At 23 : 00 on 11 February , Scharnhorst , Gneisenau , and Prinz Eugen left Brest . They entered the Channel an hour later ; the three ships sped at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) , hugging the French coast along the voyage . The British failed to detect their departure , as the submarine that had been tasked with observing the port had withdrawn to recharge its batteries . By 06 : 30 , they had passed Cherbourg , at which point they were joined by a flotilla of torpedo boats . The torpedo boats were led by Kapitän Erich Bey , aboard the destroyer Z29 . General der Jagdflieger ( General of Fighter Force ) Adolf Galland directed Luftwaffe fighter and bomber forces ( Operation Donnerkeil ) during Cerberus . The fighters flew at masthead @-@ height to avoid detection by the British radar network . Liaison officers were present on all three ships . German aircraft arrived later to jam British radar with chaff . By 13 : 00 , the ships had cleared the Strait of Dover , though half an hour later , a flight of six Swordfish torpedo bombers , with Spitfire escort , attacked the Germans . The British failed to penetrate the Luftwaffe fighter shield and all six Swordfish were destroyed . Several more attacks were launched over the next two hours , but the Luftwaffe screen repulsed them all . 
 Five British destroyers mounted an attack on the German squadron at 16 : 17 . The ships attempted to close to torpedo range , though heavy seas and overcast conditions hampered their attack . Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen inflicted serious damage to the destroyer Worcester . At 19 : 55 , Gneisenau detonated a magnetic mine off Terschelling . The mine exploded just forward of the rear gun turret but caused only minor damage . Slight flooding was quickly stopped , though the shock disabled the center turbine . The ship stopped for less than 30 minutes before resuming the voyage ; by 03 : 50 , Gneisenau and two destroyers reached Helgoland . After being joined there by Prinz Eugen , the ships left for Kiel , but thick ice in the canal forced the ships to stop in Brunsbüttel . While maneuvering in port , Gneisenau struck a submerged wreck . The collision tore a hole in the hull and caused some minor flooding . Gneisenau reached Kiel the following day , where she went into a floating dry dock at the Deutsche Werke dockyard . 
 = = Fate = = 
 Repair work on Gneisenau was completed by 26 February 1942 , and she was scheduled to deploy to Norway on 6 March . Her ammunition stores had been restocked and she was prepared for a short round of trials before her departure . On the night of 26 – 27 February , however , the British launched a heavy air raid on the ship . The ship was hit by a single bomb in her forecastle that penetrated the armored deck and exploded . Red @-@ hot bomb fragments ignited propellant charges in the forward turret and caused a tremendous explosion . The turret was thrown off its mount and the entire bow section was burned out . The crew partially flooded the magazine to prevent a more catastrophic explosion . The blast killed 112 men and wounded 21 others . 
 The extensive damage convinced the Naval Staff to rebuild Gneisenau to mount the six 38 cm guns originally planned , rather than repair the ship . The damaged bow section was removed in order to attach a lengthened bow , which would correct the decrease in freeboard that would have been caused by the heavier 38 cm guns . On 4 April , the ship went to Gotenhafen , escorted by the training ship Schlesien and the icebreaker Castor . She was formally decommissioned on 1 July . Her crew were paid off and redeployed to the U @-@ boat arm . 
 By early 1943 , the ship had been sufficiently repaired to begin the conversion process , but Hitler , angered by the failure of German surface raiders at the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 ordered the cessation of all work . Gneisenau was disarmed and her 28 cm and 15 cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries . Turret Caesar was installed in a coastal fortress in Trondheim as the coastal battery <unk> . 
 Gneisenau remained unused in Gotenhafen until the end of the war . As the Red Army advanced on the city , the remaining crew took the ship out to the entrance of the harbor and sank the vessel as a blockship on 27 March 1945 . In 1947 , the Polish government ordered the ship be removed , and initial salvage operations began . The ship was sealed and refloated on 12 September 1951 then completely scrapped , though it is believed that some of her steel was used in the construction of Polish merchant vessels . She was the largest ship raised at the time . Norway offered to return the turret from Trondheim in 1979 , though the offer was rejected . The gun turret was instead preserved as a museum in Norway .

 Kingston upon Hull ( / <unk> <unk> <unk> / KING @-@ stən ə @-@ pon <unk> , local / <unk> / ) , usually abbreviated to Hull , is a city and unitary authority in the East Riding of Yorkshire , England . It lies upon the River Hull at its junction with the Humber estuary , 25 miles ( 40 km ) inland from the North Sea , with a population of 257 @,@ 710 ( mid @-@ 2014 est . ) . 
 The town of Hull was founded late in the 12th century . The monks of Meaux Abbey needed a port where the wool from their estates could be exported . They chose a place at the junction of the rivers Hull and Humber to build a quay . 
 The exact year the town was founded is not known but it was first mentioned in 1193 . Renamed Kings @-@ town upon Hull by King Edward I in 1299 , Hull has been a market town , military supply port , trading hub , fishing and whaling centre , and industrial metropolis . 
 Hull was an early theatre of battle in the English Civil Wars . Its 18th @-@ century Member of Parliament , William Wilberforce , played a key role in the abolition of the slave trade in Britain . 
 The city is unique in the UK in having had a municipally owned telephone system from 1902 , sporting cream , not red , telephone boxes . 
 After suffering heavy damage in the Second World War ( the ' Hull Blitz ' ) , Hull weathered a period of post @-@ industrial decline , gaining unfavourable results on measures of social deprivation , education and policing . In the early 21st @-@ century spending boom before the late 2000s recession the city saw large amounts of new retail , commercial , housing and public service construction spending . 
 Tourist attractions include the historic Old Town and Museum Quarter , Hull Marina and The Deep , a city landmark . The redevelopment of one of Hull 's main thoroughfares , Ferensway , included the opening of St. Stephen 's Hull and the new Hull Truck Theatre . Spectator sports include Premier League football and Super League Rugby . The KCOM Stadium houses Hull City football club and Hull FC rugby club and The <unk> Stadium rugby club Hull Kingston Rovers . Hull is also home to the English Premier Ice Hockey League Hull Pirates . 
 In 2013 , it was announced that Hull would be the 2017 UK City of Culture . 
 In 2015 it was announced that the Ferens Art Gallery will be hosting the prestigious annual art prize , The Turner Prize , in 2017 . The prize is held outside London every other year . This important art prize receives more media coverage than any other art prize . 
 = = History = = 
 Kingston upon Hull stands on the north bank of the Humber estuary at the mouth of its tributary , the River Hull . The valley of the River Hull has been inhabited since the early Neolithic period but there is little evidence of a substantial settlement in the area of the present city . The area was attractive to people because it gave access to a prosperous hinterland and navigable rivers but the site was poor , being remote , low @-@ lying and with no fresh water . It was originally an outlying part of the hamlet of <unk> , named Wyke . The name is thought to originate either from a Scandinavian word Vik meaning creek or from the Saxon <unk> meaning dwelling place or refuge . 
 The River Hull was a good haven for shipping , whose trade included the export of wool from Meaux abbey . In 1293 the town was acquired from the abbey by King Edward I , who on 1 April 1299 granted it a royal charter that renamed the settlement King 's town upon Hull or Kingston upon Hull . The charter is preserved in the archives of the Guildhall . 
 In 1440 , a further charter incorporated the town and instituted local government consisting of a mayor , a sheriff and twelve aldermen . 
 In his Guide to Hull ( 1817 ) , J. C. Craggs provides a colourful background to Edward 's acquisition and naming of the town . He writes that the King and a hunting party started a hare which " led them along the delightful banks of the River Hull to the hamlet of Wyke … [ Edward ] , charmed with the scene before him , viewed with delight the advantageous situation of this hitherto neglected and obscure corner . He foresaw it might become subservient both to render the kingdom more secure against foreign invasion , and at the same time greatly to enforce its commerce " . Pursuant to these thoughts , Craggs continues , Edward purchased the land from the Abbot of Meaux , had a manor hall built for himself , issued proclamations encouraging development within the town , and bestowed upon it the royal appellation , King 's Town . 
 The port served as a base for Edward I during the First War of Scottish Independence and later developed into the foremost port on the east coast of England . It prospered by exporting wool and woollen cloth , and importing wine and timber . Hull also established a flourishing commerce with the Baltic ports as part of the Hanseatic League . 
 From its medieval beginnings , Hull 's main trading links were with Scotland and northern Europe . Scandinavia , the Baltic and the Low Countries were all key trading areas for Hull 's merchants . In addition , there was trade with France , Spain and Portugal . As sail power gave way to steam , Hull 's trading links extended throughout the world . Docks were opened to serve the frozen meat trade of Australia , New Zealand and South America . Hull was also the centre of a thriving inland and coastal trading network , serving the whole of the United Kingdom . 
 Sir William de la Pole was the town 's first mayor . A prosperous merchant , de la Pole founded a family that became prominent in government . Another successful son of a Hull trading family was bishop John Alcock , who founded Jesus College , Cambridge and was a patron of the grammar school in Hull . The increase in trade after the discovery of the Americas and the town 's maritime connections are thought to have played a part in the introduction of a virulent strain of syphilis through Hull and on into Europe from the New World . 
 The town prospered during the 16th and early 17th centuries , and Hull 's affluence at this time is preserved in the form of several well @-@ maintained buildings from the period , including Wilberforce House , now a museum documenting the life of William Wilberforce . 
 During the English Civil War , Hull became strategically important because of the large arsenal located there . Very early in the war , on 11 January 1642 , the king named the Earl of Newcastle governor of Hull while Parliament nominated Sir John Hotham and asked his son , Captain John Hotham , to secure the town at once . Sir John Hotham and Hull corporation declared support for Parliament and denied Charles I entry into the town . Charles I responded to these events by besieging the town . This siege helped precipitate open conflict between the forces of Parliament and those of the Royalists . 
 Throughout the second half of the 19th century and leading up to the First World War , the Port of Hull played a major role in the transmigration of Northern European settlers to the New World , with thousands of emigrants sailing to the city and stopping for administrative purposes before travelling on to Liverpool and then North America . 
 Parallel to this growth in passenger shipping was the emergence of the Wilson Line of Hull . Founded in the city in 1825 by Thomas Wilson , by the early 20th century the company had grown – largely through its monopolisation of North Sea passenger routes and later mergers and acquisitions – to be the largest privately owned shipping company in the world , with over 100 ships sailing to different parts of the globe . The Wilson Line was sold to the Ellerman Line – which itself was owned by Hull @-@ born magnate ( and the richest man in Britain at the time ) Sir John Ellerman . 
 Whaling played a major role in the town 's fortunes until the mid @-@ 19th century . Hull 's prosperity peaked in the decades just before the First World War ; it was during this time , in 1897 , that city status was granted . After the decline of the whaling industry , emphasis shifted to deep @-@ sea trawling until the Anglo @-@ Icelandic Cod War of 1975 – 1976 . The conditions set at the end of this dispute initiated Hull 's economic decline . 
 Many of the suburban areas on the western side of Hull were built in the 1930s , particularly Willerby Road and Anlaby Park , as well as most of Willerby itself . This was part of the biggest British housing boom of the 20th century ( possibly ever ) . 
 = = = Hull Blitz = = = 
 The city 's port and industrial facilities , coupled with its proximity to mainland Europe and ease of location being on a major estuary , led to extremely widespread damage by bombing raids during the Second World War ; much of the city centre was destroyed . Hull had 95 % of its houses damaged or destroyed , making it the most severely bombed British city or town , apart from London , during the Second World War . More than 1 @,@ 200 people died in air raids on the city and some 3 @,@ 000 others were injured . 
 The worst of the bombing occurred in 1941 . Little was known about this destruction by the rest of the country at the time , since most of the radio and newspaper reports did not reveal Hull by name but referred to it as " a North @-@ East town " or " a northern coastal town " . Most of the city centre was rebuilt in the years following the war . As recently as 2006 researchers found documents in the local archives that suggested an unexploded wartime bomb might be buried beneath a major new redevelopment , The Boom , in Hull . 
 = = Government = = 
 Following the Local Government Act 1888 , Hull became a county borough , a local government district independent of the East Riding of Yorkshire . This district was dissolved under the Local Government Act 1972 , on 1 April 1974 when it became a non @-@ metropolitan district of the newly created shire county of Humberside . Humberside ( and its county council ) was abolished on 1 April 1996 and Hull was made a unitary authority area . 
 The single @-@ tier local authority of the city is now Hull City Council ( officially Kingston upon Hull City Council ) , headquartered in the Guildhall in the city centre . The council was designated as the UK 's worst performing authority in both 2004 and 2005 , but in 2006 was rated as a two star ' improving adequate ' council and in 2007 it retained its two stars with an ' improving well ' status . In the 2008 corporate performance assessment the city retained its " improving well " status but was upgraded to a three star rating . 
 The Liberal Democrats won overall control of the City Council in the 2007 local elections , ending several years in which no single party had a majority . They retained control in the 2008 local elections by an increased majority and in the 2010 local elections . Following the UK 's local elections of 2011 , the Labour Party gained control of the council , increasing their majority in the 2012 and retained this following the 2014 local elections . They increased their majority by one in the 2015 local elections . 
 The city returned three Members of Parliament to the House of Commons and at the last general election , in 2015 , elected three Labour MPs : Alan Johnson who was the former Home Secretary , Diana Johnson and Karl Turner . 
 William Wilberforce is the most celebrated of Hull 's former MPs . He was a native of the city and the member for Hull from 1780 to 1784 when he was elected as an Independent member for Yorkshire . 
 It lies within the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency of the European Parliament , which in the May 2014 European Election elected three UKIP , two Labour and one Conservative MEPs . 
 Hull is the only city and forms the major urban area in the official government @-@ defined Hull and Humber Ports City Region . 
 = = Geography = = 
 At 53 ° 44 ′ 30 ″ N 0 ° 20 ′ 0 ″ W , 154 miles ( 248 km ) north of London , Kingston upon Hull is on the northern bank of the Humber estuary . The city centre is west of the River Hull and close to the Humber . The city is built upon alluvial and glacial deposits which overlie chalk rocks but the underlying chalk has no influence on the topography . The land within the city is generally very flat and is only 2 to 4 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 to 13 ft ) above sea level . Because of the relative flatness of the site there are few physical constraints upon building and many open areas are the subject of pressures to build . 
 The parishes of Drypool , <unk> , Sculcoates , and most of Sutton parish , were absorbed within the borough of Hull in the 19th and 20th centuries . Much of their area has been built over , and socially and economically they have long been inseparable from the city . Only Sutton retained a recognisable village centre in the late 20th century , but on the south and east the advancing suburbs had already reached it . The four villages were , nevertheless , distinct communities , of a largely rural character , until their absorption in the borough — Drypool and Sculcoates in 1837 , <unk> in 1882 , and Sutton in 1929 . The current boundaries of the city are tightly drawn and exclude many of the metropolitan area 's nearby villages , of which Cottingham is the largest . The city is surrounded by the rural East Riding of Yorkshire . 
 Some areas of Hull lie on reclaimed land at or below sea level . The Hull Tidal Surge Barrier is at the point where the River Hull joins the Humber estuary and is lowered at times when unusually high tides are expected . It is used between 8 and 12 times per year and protects the homes of approximately 10 @,@ 000 people from flooding . Due to its low level , Hull is expected to be at increasing levels of risk from flooding due to global warming . 
 Many areas of Hull were flooded during the June 2007 United Kingdom floods , with 8600 homes and 1300 businesses affected . 
 Historically , Hull has been affected by tidal and storm flooding from the Humber ; the last serious floods were in the 1950s , in 1953 , 1954 and the winter of 1959 . 
 Unlike many other English cities , Hull has no cathedral . It is in the Diocese of York and has a <unk> bishop . However , Hull 's Holy Trinity Church is the largest parish church in England by floor area . The church dates to about 1300 . Hull forms part of the Southern Vicariate of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Middlesbrough and included among Hull 's Catholic churches is St Charles Borromeo , the oldest post @-@ Reformation Roman Catholic church in the city . 
 There are several seamen 's missions and churches in Hull . The Mission to Seafarers has a centre at West King George Dock and the St Nikolaj Danish Seamen 's Church is located in Osborne Street . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Located in Northern England , Hull has a temperate maritime climate which is dominated by the passage of mid @-@ latitude depressions . The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream makes the region mild for its latitude . Locally , the area is sunnier than most areas this far north in the British Isles , and also considerably drier , due to the rain shadowing effect of the Pennines . It is also one of the most northerly areas where the July maximum temperature exceeds 21 @.@ 5 ° C ( 70 @.@ 7 ° F ) , although this appears to be very localised around the city itself . 
 The absolute maximum temperature recorded is 34 @.@ 4 ° C ( 93 @.@ 9 ° F ) , set in August 1990 . Typically , the warmest day should reach 28 @.@ 8 ° C ( 83 @.@ 8 ° F ) , though slightly over 10 days should achieve a temperature of 25 @.@ 1 ° C ( 77 @.@ 2 ° F ) or more in an " average " year . All averages refer to the 1981 @-@ 2010 period .

 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of Hull was built on trading and seafaring , firstly whaling and later <unk> . Merchant 's houses such as Blaydes House and some warehouses survive in the Old Town , where trade was centred on the River Hull , later shifting to the Humber docks . Another major industry was oilseed crushing . Although the fishing industry declined in the 1970s , the city remains a busy port , handling 13 million tonnes of cargo per year . The port operations run by Associated British Ports and other companies in the port employ 5 @,@ 000 people . A further 18 @,@ 000 are employed as a direct result of the port 's activities . The port area of the city has diversified to compensate for the decline in fishing by the introduction of Roll @-@ on Roll @-@ off ferry services to the continent of Europe . These ferries now handle over a million passengers each year . Hull has exploited the leisure industry by creating Hull Marina from the old Humber Street Dock in the centre of the city . It opened in 1983 and has 270 berths for yachts and small sailing craft . 
 Industry in the city is focused on the chemical and health care sectors . Several well @-@ known British companies , including BP , Smith & Nephew , Seven Seas , and Reckitt Benckiser , have facilities in Hull . The health care sector is further enhanced by the research facilities provided by the University of Hull through the Institute of <unk> and the Hull York Medical School partnerships . In recent years , with the decline of fishing and heavy industry , the retail sector , tourism , the arts and further and higher education sectors have played an increasingly prominent role in the process of economic regeneration and raising the profile of the city . In 2009 it was estimated that businesses in Hull deliver an annual turnover of almost £ 8 billion , and over 5 million annual visitors contribute almost £ 210 million to Hull 's economy .

 As the biggest settlement in the East Riding of Yorkshire and the local transport hub , Hull is a natural focus for retail shoppers . Major department stores in Hull include Debenhams , House of Fraser and British Home Stores ( BHS ) . The city centre has three main shopping centres , St. Stephen 's , Princes Quay and the Prospect Centre . There are also a number of " retail parks " , and suburban shopping centres including the North Point Shopping Centre at Bransholme , St Andrews Quay retail park on the Humber bank , as well as near Great Gutter lane ( Willerby ) , Mount Pleasant ( Holderness Road ) , Priory Park ( near Hessle ) and Kingswood retail park ( Kingswood ) 
 <unk> is one of the shopping streets , along with King Edward Street and Carr lane . 
 The electrical retailer Comet Group was founded in the city as Comet Battery Stores Limited in 1933 ; the company 's first superstore was opened in Hull in 1968 . 
 The city 's branch of Woolworth 's on King Edward Street closed in 2008 , as did the branch of T J Hughes on the site of the former C & A store on Ferensway in August 2011 , following the parent companies ' bankruptcies . The main non @-@ town @-@ centre shopping streets are Hessle Road , Holderness Road , <unk> Avenue , Beverley Road , as well as Princes Avenue and Newland Avenue . Two covered shopping arcades remain in the town centre : the Hepworth and Paragon Arcades . 
 The Prospect Centre on Prospect Street is a smaller , older shopping centre with a range of chain stores , banks and fashion retailers . It contains branches of Boots , Claire 's , a large Wilkinsons , <unk> , W H Smith , Santander , and Hull 's main post office . At Bransholme , the North Point Shopping Centre ( Bransholme Shopping Centre ) contains a similar range of popular chain stores and budget @-@ oriented retailers including Boyes and Heron Foods . 
 The Princes Quay Shopping Centre ( 1991 ) was built on stilts over the closed Prince 's Dock , and houses a variety of chain stores and food outlets . It was originally built with four retail floors , known as " decks " . The uppermost deck has housed a Vue cinema since December 2007 .

 = = Dialect and accent = = 
 The local accent is quite distinctive and noticeably different from the rest of the East Riding ; however it is still categorised among Yorkshire accents . The most notable feature of the accent is the strong I @-@ mutation in words like goat , which is [ <unk> ] in standard English and [ <unk> ] across most of Yorkshire , becomes [ <unk> ] ( " <unk> " ) in and around parts of Hull , although there is variation across areas and generations . In common with much of England ( outside of the far north ) , another feature is dropping the H from the start of words , for example Hull is more often pronounced ' Ull in the city . The vowel in " Hull " is pronounced the same way as in northern English , however , and not as the very short / ʊ / that exists in Lincolnshire . Though the rhythm of the accent is more like that of northern Lincolnshire than that of the rural East Riding , which is perhaps due to migration from Lincolnshire to the city during its industrial growth , one feature that it does share with the surrounding rural area is that an / aɪ / sound in the middle of a word often becomes an / ɑː / : for example , " five " may sound like " <unk> " , " time " like " <unk> " . 
 The vowel sound in words such as burnt , nurse , first is pronounced with an / ɛ / sound , as is also heard in Middlesbrough and in areas of Liverpool yet this sound is very uncommon in most of Yorkshire . The word pairs spur / spare and fur / fair illustrate this . The generational and / or geographic variation can be heard in word pairs like pork / poke or cork / coke , or hall / hole , which some people pronounce almost identically , sounding to non @-@ locals like they are using the second of the two variations - while others make more of a vocal distinction ; anyone called " Paul " ( for example ) soon becomes aware of this ( pall / pole ) .

 = History of the Rove Formation = 
 The Rove Formation is located in the upper northeastern part of Cook County , Minnesota , United States , and extends into Ontario , Canada . It is the youngest of the many Animikie layers , a layer of sedimentary rocks . 
 Before the Rove sediments were laid down , during the Archean Eon , the Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region ; this boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone . Several million years later a thin layer of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older , underlying , Gunflint Iron Formation , and the Rove was then deposited on top of the ejecta ; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10 @.@ 2 on the Richter scale . 
 During the Middle Precambrian a shallow inland sea covered much of the Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group , layers of sedimentary rocks overlying 2700 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Archean rocks . The Rove Formation is the youngest of the many Animikie layers . 
 After the Rove sediments were deposited , the Penokean orogeny added more land mass by accretion that occurred from the south . A few hundred million years later the proto @-@ North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone , which is a bow @-@ shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas , arcing through the present @-@ day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan . Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers . The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained , while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers . The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges . 
 As a result of erosion of sandstone and the erosion @-@ resistant sills and dikes , the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys . The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow , and they orient from the east to west . The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub @-@ Arctic climate . In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap . 
 = = Location = = 
 The Rove Formation is in the Arrowhead Region of northeastern Minnesota , U.S. , and extends into Ontario , Canada . In Minnesota it occurs along the <unk> border from Gunflint Lake to Pigeon Point ( both in northeastern Cook County ) and northward into Canada . Pigeon Point is the most eastern part of Minnesota ; it is a diabase sill about 152 m ( 500 ft ) thick . Both the north and south coasts of the point expose Rove slates under and over the sill . Within the sill , rates of cooling and gravity have created an interesting distribution of rock types . 
 The visible formation is in Minnesota and contains many east @-@ west oriented ridges and valleys . Many lakes in this 5 to 8 km ( 3 to 5 mi ) wide band along the Canadian border are in the elongated east @-@ west valleys ; included are Caribou , Clearwater , Crocodile , Daniels , Duncan , Dunn , Hungry Jack , Iron , Loon , Moose , Pine , Portage and South . In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlaid by a thick diabase sill .

The Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region ; this boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone ( GLTZ ) . 
 Northeast Minnesota has 2700 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ ago exposed rocks formed during volcanic activity that was in the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor . These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton ; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield , which became part of the North American craton . The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust , and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton .

 = = = = Animikie Group = = = = 
 The Animikie Basin , measuring 700 x 400 km ( 420 mi x 240 mi ) , is an elongated oval straddling the North Shore of Lake Superior , mainly in Minnesota . Approximately the northwestern two @-@ thirds lies to the northwest of the shoreline ; the southeastern third lies to the southeast of the shoreline ( so is under Lake Superior 's waters ) . 
 During the Middle Precambrian a shallow inland sea covered much of the Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group , which are layers of sedimentary rocks which unconformably overlies 2700 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Archean rocks . This group contains both the Rove and Gunflint Iron formations . The Rove Formation is the youngest of the many Animikie layers ; it consists of gently tilted fine @-@ grained sediments . It is composed of greywackes and black shale , and contains lower concentrations of iron and taconite than the underlying Gunflint Iron Formation does . 
 The Rove Formation consists of a lower argillite unit , a middle transition unit and an upper thin @-@ bedded greywacke unit . The lower argillite unit is about 150 m ( 490 ft ) thick ; this layer contains fine @-@ grained greywacke , and silty and graphitic <unk> . <unk> is a sedimentary rock composed of a mixture of poorly sorted grains of sand , silt and clay particles . <unk> is a fine @-@ grained sedimentary rock composed primarily of clay particles ; they are essentially lithified muds and oozes . <unk> is abundant in the middle unit and dominates the upper unit . The complete thickness of the upper two units is about 900 m ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) . 
 Gunter Faure and Jack <unk> , using Rb @-@ Sr dating , determined the age to be 1635 ± 24 million years old . The Resident Geologist Program , Geology of the Thunder Bay South District , reports an age of 1800 million years old . 
 = = = = Penokean orogeny = = = = 
 The Penokean Mountain Range formed in the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 million years ago , when an oceanic island arc called the Pembine – Wausau terrane collided with the southern margin of the Superior craton . From 1880 to 1850 million years ago , the region was volcanically active . This volcanism ceased 1850 million years ago when a fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone . Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior craton in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening . Rocks of the Pembine – <unk> terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior craton , forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior , crossed parts of three US states ( south @-@ central Minnesota , northern Wisconsin , and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan ) , and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario , Canada . Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards , forming a foreland basin at around 1850 million years ago in the south and 1835 million years ago in the north . The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin . In the southern basin , crustal thickening caused high @-@ grade metamorphism of the sedimentary fill by 1830 million years ago . A series of post @-@ orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 million years ago , ; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny . 
 = = = = Sudbury impact ejecta = = = = 
 At the base of the Rove Formation , between the Rove and the underlying Gunflint Iron Formation , there is a lateral layer of shocked quartz and feldspar grains found within accretionary lapilli , accreted grain clusters and <unk> masses . These pieces of debris indicate that the layer contains hypervelocity impact ejecta . Zircon <unk> data shows that this layer formed 1878 to 1836 million years ago ; the Sudbury Impact event occurred 1 @,@ 850 ± 1 million years ago . Because of the closeness in dating and the nearness of the crater , the Sudbury Impact event is the likely source for the ejecta ; these are the oldest ejecta linked to a specific event on Earth . In the Rove area this layer is about 7 @.@ 6 m ( 25 ft ) thick ; this thin layer very likely represents the catastrophic events of a single day nearly 1 @,@ 850 million years ago . 
 Evidence indicates a 16 km ( 10 mi ) diameter meteorite collided with Earth in the current @-@ day vicinity of Sudbury , Ontario , Canada , about 1 @,@ 850 million years ago . The meteorite vaporized and created a 240 km ( 150 mi ) wide crater ( this is the second @-@ largest impact depression on Earth ) . This impact is 770 km ( 480 mi ) east of the Minnesota @-@ Ontario border of the Rove Formation . Earthquakes shattered the ground hundreds of miles away and within seconds ejecta ( cloud of ash , rock fragments , gases and droplets of molten rock ) began to spread around the globe . It is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake would have registered 10 @.@ 2 on the Richter scale . Seas covered the Rove Formation area and the Sudbury impact generated huge tsunamis . 
 To put the Sudbury meteorite impact in perspective , the Chicxulub impact on the Yucatán Peninsula occurred 66 million years ago from an object perhaps 60 % the size of the Sudbury impactor ; the results of this impact caused the worldwide extinction of many species ( including dinosaurs ) . 
 The Sudbury Impact would have had global ramifications ; it is conjectured that this caused the end of the iron deposits . The impact fundamentally affected concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the sea ; the accumulation of marine sediments ( known as banded @-@ iron formations ) were almost instantaneously shut down . Banded @-@ iron formations are massive deposits rich in iron oxides ; they accumulated at several periods in the Earth 's geologic past . One extended episode of banded @-@ iron formation buildup suddenly ended about 1 @,@ 850 million years ago . In northeastern Minnesota these banded @-@ iron formations lie immediately under the ejecta layer . Minnesota 's Iron Range is composed of this layer of banded @-@ iron formation . 
 Most of the impact layer in the Rove area consists of <unk> , a mixture of rock fragments which ripped loose from the sea floor during the earthquakes . The tsunamis jumbled the loosened bedrock and ejecta together ; over time this layer was buried by younger sediments , cemented together and fused by molten rock to form a solid layer . Ejecta from the Sudbury Impact was found in May 2007 on the Gunflint Trail in Cook County , Minnesota . Geologists Mark <unk> and Paul <unk> from the University of Minnesota took advantage of the burnt @-@ over landscape resulting from the intense , hot Ham Lake fire to explore the newly exposed geology along the Gunflint Trail . <unk> picked up some rocks which turned out to be ash and debris from the 1 @,@ 100 km ( 680 mi ) distant impact site ; this is the farthest distance that Sudbury <unk> has been found . 
 = = = = Midcontinent Rift = = = = 
 The Midcontinent Rift ( also known as the <unk> Rift ) began about 1 @,@ 100 million years ago ; it lasted for about 20 million years . After the Penokean Mountains had eroded away , the proto @-@ North American continent nearly split in half along this rift zone . The 2 @,@ 000 km ( 1 @,@ 200 mi ) bow @-@ shaped rift extended from northeastern Kansas , through the southeastern corner of Nebraska , diagonally northeast through Iowa , through Minnesota along the current Minnesota @-@ Wisconsin border , arced through the present @-@ day Lake Superior basin and angled southeasterly through Michigan . 
 The Midcontinent Rift is the largest @-@ known continental rift in the world . The rift began as a hot spot of basaltic magma underneath the Lake Superior region ; it extruded layers of lava up to 20 km ( 12 mi ) thick and extending up to 100 km ( 60 mi ) on either side of the rift . The deposited lava along the North Shore of Lake Superior is 7 @,@ 620 m ( 5 mi ) thick . 
 This was a fast @-@ spreading rift ; the resulting basalts show little interaction with the then @-@ existing rock . These immense volumes of mafic lava were generated in two major pulses , mostly via a hot mantle plume . Along the North Shore of Lake Superior , one can see the solidified lava ( igneous rock ) most everywhere . In the Rove region the magma didn 't reach the surface ; it intruded into fractures in the formation and slowly cooled to become diabase ( rather than basalt ) . These solidified bodies are the Pigeon River and Logan Intrusion <unk> . 
 The continent didn 't split into two because the Grenville province ( a microcontinent ) was converging with the proto @-@ North American continent to the east . This convergence applied compressional forces to the rift , preventing the complete splitting apart of the proto @-@ North American continent . 
 This rift was the last of volcanic or mountain @-@ building activity in present @-@ day Minnesota . The solidified lava flows have sagged , tilted and faulted ; this created a basin up to 5 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) deep along the rift zone . Proto @-@ Lake Superior filled the basin . 
 = = = = Puckwunge Formation = = = = 
 The Puckwunge Formation has buff to grey sandstone which comes from sediments deposited during the early stages of the Midcontinent rift ; zircon dating shows a time period of 1200 to 1100 million years ago . 
 Puckwunge sandstone is exposed along an extremely narrow ( feet @-@ wide ) band on the southwestern border of the Rove formation . The Puckwunge exposure begins at Raspberry Point within the Grand Portage National Monument on Lake Superior , Cook County , Minnesota , and extends for about 40 km ( 25 mi ) inland to the northwest . The Rove Formation is located to the northeast of the Puckwunge sandstone ; none is southwest of the border . The Rove Formation is bisected by several bands of Pigeon River <unk> ; these bands are in a west @-@ to @-@ east orientation . The bands of Pigeon River <unk> do extend southwesterly past the Puckwunge Formation . 
 = = = Quaternary Period and glaciation = = = 
 The Quaternary Period began about 2 million years ago and continues today . This is the period of advancing and retreating glaciers . The Rove region has multiple tilted layers of volcanic rocks and easily eroded shale . The more resistant diabase dikes and sills remained , while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers . These former shale valleys filled with water , forming the many lakes in the region . The character of the slates made them especially well suited for glacial quarrying , much more so than the contiguous sills . A cuesta – a ridge formed by gently tilted sedimentary rock layers – topography had developed and was dominated by major east @-@ west valleys with a few pronounced gaps in the intervening ridges . 
 The Rainy Lobe of the Wisconsin glaciation was the most recent of the glaciation events , and it retreated about 10 @,@ 000 years ago . Glacial scratches and grooves in Rove rocks indicate a north or somewhat east @-@ of @-@ north glacial movement . This direction is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges . The lakes in the Rove Formation area are unique from other well @-@ known linear bedrock lakes in North America because their long axes lie transverse to the general movement of the glaciers . 
 When continental glaciers moved over the Rove Formation area , the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north . The base of the ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief of a few hundred feet . Because the ice over the valleys would be thicker than the ice over the ridges , obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of the valleys . The ridges would not be appreciably eroded , partly because the ice would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic , and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice . 
 The weight of the ice sheet compressed the land and created depressions . As the glacier retreated , the weight and pressure were relieved from the surface of the land and the land rebounded ; the rebound process continues , and is estimated to be 100 m ( 330 ft ) .
