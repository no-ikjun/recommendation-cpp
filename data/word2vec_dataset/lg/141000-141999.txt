 = Interstate 75 in Michigan = 
 Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Miami , Florida , to Sault Ste . Marie in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan . I @-@ 75 enters Michigan from Ohio in the south , north of Toledo and runs generally northward through Detroit , Pontiac and Bay City , crosses the Mackinac Bridge , and ends at the Canadian border in Sault Ste . Marie . The freeway runs for approximately 396 miles ( 637 km ) on both of Michigan 's peninsulas . The landscapes traversed by I @-@ 75 include Southern Michigan farmland , northern forests , suburban bedroom communities , and the urban core of Detroit . The freeway also uses three of the state 's monumental bridges to cross major bodies of water . There are four auxiliary Interstates in the state related to I @-@ 75 , as well as nine current or former business routes , with either Business Loop I @-@ 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) or Business Spur I @-@ 75 ( BS I @-@ 75 ) designations . 
 The freeway bears several names in addition to the I @-@ 75 designation . The southern segment was called the Detroit – Toledo Expressway during planning in the 1950s and 1960s . Through Detroit , I @-@ 75 is the Fisher Freeway or the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway , named for pioneers in the auto industry . Sections on either side of the Mackinac Bridge are the G. Mennen Williams Freeway or the Prentiss M. Brown Freeway , named for politicians who helped get the bridge built . Officially , the entire length is the American Legion Memorial Highway , after the organization of the same name . Various sections carry components of the four Great Lakes Circle Tours in the state . 
 Several Indian trails spanned the state along the general path of the modern freeway . After statehood , several of these were converted into plank roads that later became some of the first state highways . In the 1920s , five of these were added to the United States Numbered Highway System : US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) , US 10 , US 24 , US 25 , and US 27 . In the 1950s , a Michigan Turnpike was proposed as a tolled , controlled @-@ access highway in the Lower Peninsula . After passage of the Federal Highway Act of 1956 , this turnpike proposal was shelved as a free Interstate Highway was planned . Construction started in 1957 , signs went up in 1959 , and I @-@ 75 was completed in 1973 . Since completion , the freeway has been upgraded with the construction of the Zilwaukee Bridge near Saginaw and improved connections to the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit .

 Known as " Michigan 's Main Street " , I @-@ 75 is listed on the National Highway System ( NHS ) for its entire length . The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . The freeway is the busiest in the state : between M @-@ 8 ( Davison Highway ) and McNichols Road in Detroit approximately 194 @,@ 300 vehicles used the freeway on average each day in 2010 ; in contrast the lowest traffic level was 3 @,@ 208 vehicles between the M @-@ 48 and M @-@ 80 interchanges in Chippewa County . I @-@ 75 carries segments of all four Great Lakes Circle Tours in the state . It is also the only highway located on both Michigan 's Upper and Lower peninsulas ( UP and LP , respectively ) . Between the Ohio state line and Kawkawlin , I @-@ 75 contains between a minimum of six and a maximum of ten lanes total ; other sections vary between four and six lanes in total .

 Crossing the state line north of Toledo , Ohio , I @-@ 75 enters Michigan in Monroe County carrying the Lake Erie Circle Tour ( LECT ) near the North Maumee Bay of Lake Erie . The freeway runs parallel to the shoreline of the Great Lake and past the community of Luna Pier . Further north , I @-@ 75 passes to the southeast of Monroe and crosses the River Raisin between the city and the river mouth . North of the river , the freeway turns further inland running through farmland . Near Newport , I @-@ 275 splits off to the northwest and I @-@ 75 continues its northeasterly trek through Monroe County . When it crosses the Huron River , the trunkline enters Wayne County between South Rockwood and Rockwood . 
 On the north side of the county line , I @-@ 75 begins to run inland of , and parallel to , the Detroit River , entering the Downriver area . The freeway turns northerly after the interchange with M @-@ 85 ( Fort Street ) near Gibraltar , and the LECT departs I @-@ 75 to follow M @-@ 85 north of the interchange . The landscape transitions to suburban residential areas instead of farmland through this area . The freeway turns back northeasterly in Taylor and intersects the southern end of M @-@ 39 ( Southfield Highway ) in Lincoln Park . I @-@ 75 crosses the Ecorse River and passes through an industrial area of Metro Detroit . Further north , the freeway spans the River Rouge in the southern part of Detroit . 
 I @-@ 75 parallels to M @-@ 85 ( Fort Street ) and follows the Detroit River as far east as the Ambassador Bridge . Near the bridge 's approaches , the freeway turns 90 ° away from the river and intersects the eastern end of I @-@ 96 before turning again to follow the river further inland . From there , I @-@ 75 meets M @-@ 10 ( Lodge Freeway ) and crosses under M @-@ 1 ( Woodward Avenue ) . East of Woodward , the freeway travels past both Comerica Park and Ford Field , homes of the Detroit Tigers and Detroit Lions professional sports teams , respectively . 
 = = = Detroit to the Tri @-@ Cities = = = 
 Immediately east of Ford Field , I @-@ 75 turns northwesterly to follow the Chrysler Freeway away from the downtown Detroit area . The transition from the Fisher Freeway involves a set of one @-@ lane ramps through the interchange with the connections to Interstate 375 and M @-@ 3 ( Gratiot Avenue ) . Heading north @-@ northwesterly , I @-@ 75 passes to the east of the campus of Wayne State University and through an interchange with I @-@ 94 ( Edsel Ford Freeway ) . The Chrysler Freeway passes to the west of Hamtramck and to the east of Highland Park , enclaves within Detroit . I @-@ 75 meets M @-@ 8 ( Davison Freeway ) and continues through residential areas of Detroit 's northern side . North of M @-@ 102 ( 8 Mile Road ) , the freeway crosses out of Detroit and into Oakland County . The Chrysler Freeway jogs through the suburb of Hazel Park , site of the " worst freeway for accidents in Metro Detroit " at a curve near 9 Mile Road . 
 Further north , I @-@ 75 intersects I @-@ 696 near 10 Mile Road . The freeway continues northward for about six miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) into Troy , where it turns westward . The route for I @-@ 75 zig @-@ zags through Troy and Auburn Hills as the freeway alternates from north – south to east – west to bypass Pontiac . Near the M @-@ 59 interchange , I @-@ 75 passes the headquarters for Chrysler . Further north , by the M @-@ 24 interchange , it runs near The Palace of Auburn Hills , home of the Detroit Pistons . The freeway traverses through additional suburban residential areas as it runs northwesterly away from Pontiac . These subdivisions end north of Clarkston , which is the location of the northern terminus for US 24 . Continuing through Holly and Newark , the freeway transitions back to a rural , wooded setting . 
 As I @-@ 75 approaches Grand Blanc , the landscape changes back to suburbs . I @-@ 475 ( UAW Freeway ) splits off to the north to bypass the east side of Flint , and I @-@ 75 merges with US 23 . The combined I @-@ 75 / US 23 turns northerly to round the west side of the city . I @-@ 75 / US 23 meets I @-@ 69 near the Bishop International Airport southwest of downtown Flint . The freeway continues northward along the western residential neighborhoods , encountering the northern end of I @-@ 475 near Mount Morris . I @-@ 75 passes to the west of Clio and the east of Birch Run , the latter home to a large outlet mall . From there , the trunkline travels through farmland in southern Saginaw County . 
 = = = Central Michigan = = = 
 I @-@ 75 / US 23 enters the southern reaches of the suburban Tri @-@ Cities at Bridgeport and proceeds northward through the area . The freeway passes to the east of downtown Saginaw . I @-@ 675 splits off to run westward into downtown , and I @-@ 75 curves around to the northwest to cross the Saginaw River on the Zilwaukee Bridge in the suburb of Zilwaukee . North of the river , I @-@ 675 reconnects to I @-@ 75 , which continues northward into Bay County . The freeway passes to the west of Bay City , encountering the eastern end of the US 10 freeway . From there , I @-@ 75 / US 23 curves northwesterly to bypass Kawkawlin before continuing north to the Standish area through farmlands inland from the Saginaw Bay . West of Standish , US 23 splits to follow the Lake Huron shoreline , and I @-@ 75 turns northwesterly to run inland . 
 West of Sterling , the landscape changes again ; in this area the freeway enters forest lands . I @-@ 75 continues northwestward through Arenac County and crosses into western Ogemaw County . M @-@ 30 passes under the freeway without an interchange as I @-@ 75 rounds the west side of West Branch . On the northwest side of that city , M @-@ 55 merges onto I @-@ 75 , and the two highways turn to run concurrently westward into Roscommon County . East of Prudenville , M @-@ 55 splits from the freeway . I @-@ 75 turns northward to curve around the east of Houghton and Higgins lakes . Turning back to the northwest , the trunkline bypasses Roscommon to the south and transfers into southern Crawford County . About five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of the county line , I @-@ 75 meets the northern end of US 127 , the former US 27 . 
 = = = Northern Michigan = = = 
 After the US 127 interchange , I @-@ 75 turns northward , and passes to the east of Grayling . There are a pair of interchanges on either end of town for BL I @-@ 75 , and the southern one is a partial interchange ; only northbound I @-@ 75 traffic may access the business loop and traffic entering the freeway may only access southbound I @-@ 75 . There is no interchange further north for M @-@ 72 ; access to that highway is provided through the business loop . On the north side of Grayling , there is a full interchange for BL I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 93 that provides the southbound I @-@ 75 connection to M @-@ 72 as well as access from both directions to the Hartwick Pines State Park . 
 Crossing into southern Otsego County , I @-@ 75 continues northward through Northern Michigan forests . It passes to the east of the community of Waters and Otsego Lake . North of exit 279 , I @-@ 75 proceeds by the Gaylord Regional Airport and crosses the 45th Parallel , the halfway mark between the Equator and the North Pole by latitude . The freeway then traverses the west side of Gaylord and continues through forests in the northern sections of the county . North of Vanderbilt , I @-@ 75 enters southern Cheboygan County , assuming the G. Mennen Williams Freeway name . 
 I @-@ 75 continues northward through Cheboygan County , passing the community of Indian River and spanning the river of the same name . North of town , the freeway traverses the area between Burt and Mullett lakes before intersecting the southern end of M @-@ 27 ; that highway provides access to Topinabee and Cheboygan . I @-@ 75 continues northward through tree farms and other agricultural properties in rural Cheboygan County . Cheboygan is accessible by way of interchanges for C @-@ 64 and C @-@ 66 , a pair of county @-@ designated highways in this area . North of C @-@ 66 , I @-@ 75 turns northwesterly . The freeway meets the northern end of US 31 and picks up the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( LMCT ) designation before entering Emmet County on the south side of Mackinaw City . I @-@ 75 then parallels the county line on the west side of the village , meeting the northern end of US 23 . After that interchange , the Lake Huron Circle Tour ( LHCT ) merges in from the south . There is one more interchange along the freeway before I @-@ 75 ascends the approaches to the Mackinac Bridge . 
 = = = Mackinac Bridge = = = 
 The Mackinac Bridge carries I @-@ 75 across the Straits of Mackinac that separate Michigan 's Upper and Lower peninsulas ; the straits also form the connection between Lakes Michigan and Huron . The structure , unlike the rest of the state highways in Michigan like I @-@ 75 , is under the maintenance and control of the Mackinac Bridge Authority ( MBA ) . The authority collects a toll from traffic that crosses the bridge , which as of January 1 , 2012 , is $ 4 for passenger cars and $ 5 per axle for commercial vehicles and motorhomes . In addition to cash , the MBA offers a pre @-@ paid debit card option for the payment of tolls . The authority also provides a driver assistance program that will drive vehicles across the bridge at no additional charge ; motorists who use the service have a fear of bridges . Because the bridge normally only allows motor vehicles , bicyclists and snowmobiles shuttled across are subject to fees . The authority maintains a small police department to patrol the bridge and escort vehicles across , and a pair of radio station transmitters that broadcast bridge conditions and travel information on AM 530 and AM 1610 . 
 = = = Upper Peninsula = = = 
 North of the Mackinac Bridge , I @-@ 75 passes to the west of downtown St. Ignace , traveling between the Father Marquette National Memorial and the Straits State Park . There is an interchange north of the toll plaza that marks the eastern end of US 2 in the state . The LMCT departs I @-@ 75 to follow US 2 while the LHCT follows BL I @-@ 75 through town . The freeway curves around the Mackinac County Airport and meets the northern end of the business loop near Castle Rock ; the LHCT returns to I @-@ 75 at that interchange as well . Continuing northward , M @-@ 123 ( Tahquamenon Trail ) intersects from the west as the freeway parallels H @-@ 63 ( Mackinac Trail ) , the former route of US 2 . I @-@ 75 crosses the Carp River and follows the shores of St. Martin Bay before meeting M @-@ 134 . At that interchange , the LHCT departs again to run eastward . Through this area , the freeway continues northeasterly , traversing the Eastern Unit of the Hiawatha National Forest . 
 I @-@ 75 crosses the Pine River before entering Chippewa County . The freeway takes a more northerly track as it travels under M @-@ 48 without an interchange . Further north , M @-@ 48 curves around to connect I @-@ 75 with Rudyard , and the freeway turns back to continue northeastward . About five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northeast of Rudyard , I @-@ 75 passes next to Chippewa County International Airport , the former Kincheloe Air Force Base in Kinross and Kincheloe . North of there in Dafter , the freeway intersects M @-@ 28 ( 9 Mile Road ) . Beyond that interchange , I @-@ 75 picks up the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( <unk> ) designation , which it carries the rest of the way north . On the south side of Sault Ste . Marie , the freeway meets BS I @-@ 75 and picks up the LHCT designation one more time . I @-@ 75 rounds the west side of the city , passes the Sault Ste . Marie Municipal Airport and the campus of Lake Superior State University before meeting the customs and toll plazas for the International Bridge . From there , I @-@ 75 crosses the two @-@ lane bridge and terminates at the Canadian border . As of 1 April 2012 , the toll rates on the bridge are $ 3 for passenger vehicles , $ 2 @.@ 10 for commuters , and $ 4 per axle for commercial vehicles ; currently the same toll rate is assessed in US dollars and Canadian dollars . Motorists have the option to pay with cash or an IQ Card , an electronic toll collection debit card that uses radio @-@ frequency identification technology .

 = = = Indian trails to state highways = = = 
 Before Michigan became a state , the first land transportation corridors were the Indian trails . The French @-@ Indian Trail ran through southeastern Michigan between Toledo , Monroe and Detroit . The Saginaw Trail ran north from Detroit to the Saginaw area where it connected with the original Mackinaw Trail that ran roughly parallel to , and west of , the modern I @-@ 75 . Another path , the Cheboygan Trail , ran parallel to the modern freeway to the east between the West Branch area and Cheboygan . In the UP , an extension of the Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace and Sault Ste . Marie . In the 19th century , the Michigan Legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in the state , many of which replaced the original Indian trails . These roads were originally made of oak planks , but later legislation permitted gravel as well . By the first decade of the 20th century , only 23 of the 202 chartered turnpikes were still in operation ; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways . The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century . 
 The State Trunkline Highway System was formed on May 13 , 1913 , and several sections of the system were designated along the course of the then @-@ future I @-@ 75 . Division 1 connected the Ohio state line northeasterly to Detroit , and Division 2 connected Detroit with Mackinaw City . A branch of Division 7 ran north from St. Ignace to Sault Ste . Marie . The system was signposted in 1919 , and those highways were marked on maps for the first time . The first M @-@ 10 was designated along the highways from Ohio through Detroit to Standish . M @-@ 76 connected Standish with Grayling , where the first M @-@ 14 ran northward to Cheboygan . From there , M @-@ 10 connected to Mackinaw City . In the UP , M @-@ 12 connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste . Marie along a route to the east of the old Mackinac Trail . When the United States Numbered Highway System was formed on November 11 , 1926 , most of these highways were redesignated as part of the national system . From the state line northward , M @-@ 10 was included as a part of US 24 and US 25 . At Detroit , M @-@ 10 was used as a part of US 10 . North of Grayling , M @-@ 14 was redesignated as a part of US 27 . M @-@ 12 was used for US 2 . 
 The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) rerouted US 2 in 1933 between Rogers Park and Sault Ste . Marie . The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste . Marie ; the former routing was given the M ‑ 121 designation . 
 = = = Turnpikes and freeways = = = 
 By 1945 , a divided highway designated Alternate US 24 ( US 24A ) was opened from the state line north to Erie . After World War II , the MSHD planned to convert several highways in the state to freeways . In planning maps from 1947 , the modern I @-@ 75 corridor was included in the system that later became the Interstate Highway System . It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955 , or Yellow Book after the cover color , that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system . 
 The Michigan Turnpike Authority ( MTA ) , an agency which was created in 1951 , proposed the construction of a toll freeway to run north – south in the state . The original termini for the turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood . The state highway commissioner at the time , Charles Ziegler , distrusted a separate agency dealing with statewide road building at the time , and he worked to stall progress on any proposed turnpikes . Ziegler , who had a seat on the MTA board , publicly sparred with authority chairman George Higgins , even announcing that the MSHD would build a parallel freeway that would " reduce tolls on the turnpike 40 to 50 percent " according to consultants . Trucking interests in the state also opposed the projects , preferring a moderate gas tax increase over any tolls . Detroit denied the MTA permission to route a turnpike through the city over issues related to the River Rouge , Rouge Park and access across the right @-@ of @-@ way . After a lawsuit by City of Dearborn , the legislation creating the authority was upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court in 1955 , and the authority was allowed to sell bonds for its Bridgeport – Rockwood and Detroit – Chicago toll roads . 
 The original planning maps plotted the first turnpike to the west of Detroit , running near US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) . This route was later proposed for I @-@ 75 itself ; I @-@ 275 would have been the freeway to loop into downtown Detroit . The proposed length was increased by December 1955 ; the extended Michigan Turnpike would have run from a connection across the Ohio state line to Toledo north through Detroit and Saginaw and eventually to the southern end of the Mackinac Bridge . By the following April , any extensions were cancelled leaving the turnpike to its original termini ; the east – west companion road was also cancelled at that time . The MTA proposed a state constitutional amendment in January 1956 that would allow the Michigan Legislature to issue state @-@ guaranteed bonds for part of the MTA 's construction expenses . According to The Wall Street Journal , the authority " struggled for survival " in the face of opposition from the MSHD just two months later ; the department 's actions impaired the authority 's appropriations from the state legislature and its ability to sell the necessary bonds to pay for construction . When the federal government approved the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 , Ziegler and the MSHD announced plans for a full freeway to run north through the Lower Peninsula and continue across to the Upper Peninsula . This announcement undermined the efforts to build the Michigan Turnpike . By August 1956 , the MTA voted to reduce its operations to a skeleton staff , but moved forward in May 1957 on a bond sale to finance construction of the roadway . Financiers stated such a sale was only feasible if the turnpike was to be safe from competition . The Michigan Townships Association called for the abolition of the MTA in 1958 . The legislature killed a bill to do so in June 1959 , but it later voted to repeal the act that created the authority in 1962 .

 The first sections of freeway for I @-@ 75 were opened in 1957 , beginning with the southern section near the Ohio state line opened in October 1957 . The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1 , 1957 ; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected US 2 to the bridge . The MSHD formally proposed the I @-@ 75 number in 1958 . On June 30 of that year , the first stretch of the " Fenton – Clio Expressway " opened . Construction on the Chrysler Freeway in Detroit started on January 30 , 1959 . The I @-@ 75 signs were first installed along the Detroit – Toledo Expressway in October 1959 , replacing US 24A signage in the Monroe area , after the state waited for final approval of the numbering system to be used in the state . 
 In November 1960 , sections of freeway opened from Indian River north to the southern Mackinac Bridge approaches in Mackinaw City and from St. Ignace to Evergreen Shores , and by December , the section of freeway running between Evergreen Shores and M ‑ 123 was scheduled to open . The next year the original Zilwaukee Bridge , a bascule bridge across the Saginaw River was opened along with a section of freeway north to Kawkawlin . That September , the section between Gaylord and Vanderbilt was completed , and in October 1961 , the first segment of I @-@ 75 near Grayling opened , connecting M @-@ 18 with the city . By the end of the year , the freeway was completed between Kinross and Dafter in the UP , and the former segment of US 27 between Grayling and Gaylord was turned back to local control . After this individual segment of freeway was completed , it left a gap between Gaylord and Indian River that was designated " TO I @-@ 75 " on maps for the former segment of US 27 , and US 27 was truncated to about five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) south of Grayling . The 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) section of I @-@ 75 was opened between Gaylord and Waters in July 1962 . Another temporary " TO I @-@ 75 " designation was applied along US 10 and US 27 from Bay City to Grayling . In 1961 , the MSHD had proposed that the section of I @-@ 75 south of Detroit to Toledo be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors ; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead . 
 On October 25 , 1962 , the section of freeway from M @-@ 24 near Pontiac to the Flint area opened . The same year , the freeway gap was filled in between Gaylord and Indian River . The International Bridge and its approaches opened in Sault Ste . Marie on October 31 , 1962 . The following year , a set of segments opened in the Detroit area . The freeway was extended south from Pontiac to 11 Mile Road with a connection along M @-@ 150 to M @-@ 102 ( 8 Mile Road ) . Another section opened to connect with US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) in the Woodhaven area ; a TO I @-@ 75 designation was added to connect along US 24 and M @-@ 102 to M @-@ 150 . On the other end of the state , the gaps in the freeway across the UP were completed in 1963 as well , and the section of freeway in Northern Michigan was named the most scenic new highway in the US in 1963 by Parade magazine . The first part of the Chrysler Freeway opened to traffic on June 26 , 1964 , the southern mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of which was designated I @-@ 375 . 
 The segment of I @-@ 75 through the Downriver suburbs of Detroit between the US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) connector and M @-@ 39 ( Southfield Highway ) was completed on December 28 , 1966 . The same year , I @-@ 75 was scheduled to open southward from 11 Mile Road to M @-@ 102 ( 8 Mile Road ) . In 1967 , two segments of freeway opened . One was from Kawkawlin to Standish in October , and the other through Detroit extended I @-@ 75 along the Fisher Freeway in December . The first section of M @-@ 76 freeway from Standish northwesterly to Alger was scheduled to open in July 1968 . A one @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) section of the Chrysler Freeway through Detroit opened on December 19 , 1968 , and the remainder was scheduled to open on January 10 , 1969 . 
 In 1970 , I @-@ 75 through Detroit was completed , and two additional sections of M @-@ 76 were converted to freeway . The northern section ran from the US 27 @-@ to @-@ I @-@ 75 transition south of Grayling to the Crawford – Roscommon county line , and the second was an extension from Alger to the West Branch area . The first ice @-@ detection system in the state was installed on the River Rouge bridges in the Detroit area in an attempt to maximize driver safety . The next year , the last section of the Chrysler Freeway in Hazel Park was finished when an interchange for the then @-@ unbuilt I @-@ 696 was completed . Another segment of the M @-@ 76 freeway was completed at the same time , bypassing Roscommon . The final section between Alger and Roscommon was opened on November 1 , 1973 , in a dedication by Governor William G. Milliken . 
 Since the freeway was completed , a few changes have been made to I @-@ 75 in Michigan . MDOT truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I ‑ 75 freeway in 1983 . In 1986 , US 10 was truncated to Bay City , removing its concurrency with I @-@ 75 from there to Clarkston . Two years later , the original bascule Zilwaukee Bridge across the Saginaw River was replaced by a much higher structure slightly north of the former bridge . 
 = = = Gateway Project = = = 
 Beginning on February 25 , 2008 , I @-@ 75 closed completely to traffic in both directions from Rosa Parks Boulevard ( exit 49 ) to Clark Street ( exit 47 ) in Detroit . This facilitated the complete rebuilding of the road as part of the Ambassador Gateway Project to better connect I @-@ 75 and I @-@ 96 to the Ambassador Bridge . Through traffic on I @-@ 75 was rerouted along I @-@ 94 to I @-@ 275 and local detours were posted . The freeway reopened to traffic in June 2009 , five months ahead of schedule . The overall project to realign and connect the bridge to the freeways was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company that owns the bridge . The company 's owner was jailed for contempt of court during court proceedings in early 2012 . MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction , and the department completed the project on September 21 , 2012 . 
 = = Freeway names = = 
 I @-@ 75 has five named segments in Michigan . The southernmost section from the state line north to the Detroit area is the Detroit – Toledo Expressway . The segment through southern and central Detroit is known as the Fisher Freeway . It was dedicated on September 17 , 1970 , to the Fisher Brothers , who founded Fisher Body , later a part of General Motors . After the curve in downtown Detroit , I @-@ 75 follows the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway northward . That segment is named for Walter P. Chrysler , founder of Chrysler . The name was chosen by the Detroit Common Council on November 6 , 1957 , and codified in state law in 1990 ; the state definition for the name places the northern end of the designation at the Oakland – Genesee county line . 
 Officially , the entire length of I @-@ 75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway . As a practical matter , this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate . The American Legion was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the signage . Public Act 174 of 1984 redesignated I @-@ 75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT 's hands . Another name that was applied to all of I @-@ 75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way . Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution 216 of 1975 , the name only applied to the freeway in 1976 . The designation was formally repealed in 2001 . 
 Two other segments near the Straits of Mackinac were named in 1976 for figures instrumental in the construction of the Mackinac Bridge . From the Cheboygan – Otsego county line north to the bridge , I @-@ 75 was named for G. Mennen Williams , the former governor once called " Michigan 's Politician of the Century " in the press . The section in Mackinac County from the northern end of the Mackinac Bridge was named for Prentiss M. Brown , the former Congressman and Senator who served on the MBA board until his death in 1971 . 
 = = Monumental bridges = = 
 Along its route in the state , I @-@ 75 utilizes three of Michigan 's monumental bridges . The first of them is the Zilwaukee Bridge near Saginaw . The original bridge across the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built in 1960 as a bascule bridge to allow shipping traffic to use the river . Opening the drawbridge would back traffic up on I @-@ 75 / US 10 / US 23 for upwards of four hours on holiday weekends . Approved in 1974 , construction on the replacement bridge started in October 1979 . A major construction accident in August 1982 delayed completion of the new Zilwaukee Bridge ; a bridge pier partially collapsed when contractors overloaded a section under construction . The affected 300 @-@ foot ( 91 m ) deck segment tilted to rest three feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) higher on one end and five feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) lower on the other . The structure was originally supposed to cost $ 76 @.@ 8 million with a 1983 completion date ; in the end it cost $ 131 @.@ 3 million ( equivalent to $ 472 million in 2015 ) when the southbound span finally opened on September 19 , 1988 . The structure is the largest concrete segmental bridge in the United States . 
 The second is the Mackinac Bridge that connects Michigan 's two peninsulas at the Straits of Mackinac . A structure was first proposed in 1888 by one of the directors of the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island . Car ferry service was started in 1923 to cross the straits , and a bridge authority was first created in 1934 to investigate the possibility of building a permanent connection across the straits . This early authority started with a 1921 proposal for a series of bridges that would have connected Cheboygan to St. Ignace by way of Bois Blanc , Round , and Mackinac islands . The federal Public Works Administration rejected loan and grant requests for that project . A second , direct crossing was then proposed based on designs used for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge . The collapse of that bridge and World War II delayed any further work on a structure beyond tests of the lake bottom and the construction of the 4 @,@ 200 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 1 @,@ 300 m ) causeway on the St. Ignace side ; the first bridge authority was abolished in 1947 . The current agency was created on June 6 , 1950 . 
 The MBA was authorized in 1952 to sell bonds to finance construction , which were sold on December 17 , 1953 , to finance the $ 99 @.@ 8 million ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 28 billion in 2015 ) cost of the bridge . The structure was designed by David B. Steinman and built by Merritt @-@ Chapman & Scott for the substructure and the American Bridge Company division of U.S. Steel Corporation for the superstructure . Construction started in 1954 and the Mackinac Bridge opened to traffic on November 1 , 1957 . Final work on the bridge was completed in September 1958 . Overall , the structure has a 3 @,@ 800 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) central suspension span flanked by two 1 @,@ 800 @-@ foot ( 550 m ) side spans . With the two <unk> spans , the Mackinac Bridge is 8 @,@ 614 feet ( 2 @,@ 626 m ) long between cable anchorages , the longest in the world at the time it opened . The total length of the structure is 26 @,@ 444 feet ( 8 @,@ 060 m ) with two 555 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 169 m ) towers and 155 feet ( 47 m ) of clearance for passing ships under the main span . In 2000 , the bridge was named " Michigan 's No. 1 Civil Engineering Project of the 20th Century " by the Michigan Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers ( ASCE ) , and the structure was named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2010 by the national ASCE . 
 The northernmost of the three monumental bridges along I @-@ 75 is the International Bridge , linking the twin cities of Sault Ste . Marie in Michigan and Ontario . The governments on each side of the international border formed a bridge authority to build a highway bridge in 1935 . Construction started on the structure September 16 , 1960 . The International Bridge is nearly three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) long , encompassing spans over the American and Canadian navigation channels for the Soo Locks and the St. Mary 's River . The American approach is 2 @,@ 471 feet ( 753 m ) , and the Canadian approach is 2 @,@ 942 feet ( 897 m ) . The center span over the river is 9 @,@ 280 feet ( 2 @,@ 830 m ) , flanked by 1 @,@ 260 @-@ foot ( 380 m ) and 830 @-@ foot ( 250 m ) spans over the American and Canadian shipping channels , respectively . The bridge was designed by the same firm that handled the Mackinac Bridge for a cost of $ 20 million ( equivalent to $ 344 million in 2015 ) . It opened to traffic on October 31 , 1962 .

 There are four auxiliary Interstate Highways for I @-@ 75 in Michigan . I @-@ 275 begins as a loop from northern Monroe County and continues to connect with I @-@ 96 and I @-@ 696 . The freeway serves the population of western Wayne County and Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport . The highway was originally intended to connect with I @-@ 75 north of Pontiac . I @-@ 375 was the shortest signed Interstate in the nation ; It serves the immediate downtown Detroit area . I @-@ 475 is known as the UAW Freeway and the David Dunbar Buick Freeway . This freeway serves Flint 's downtown areas as I @-@ 75 goes to the west side of the city . The fourth auxiliary Interstate is I @-@ 675 , a loop into the city of Saginaw that served as an alternate to I @-@ 75 when the drawbridge over the Saginaw River was still operating . 
 In addition to the auxiliary Interstates , there are eight current business routes related to the freeway in the state . These business loops and spurs provide signed connections into the downtowns of Pontiac , Bay City , West Branch , Roscommon , Grayling , Gaylord , St. Ignace , and Sault Ste . Marie . A ninth highway was previously designated in Saginaw as well . 
 = Gordon Bell ( American football ) = 
 Gordon Granville Bell ( born December 25 , 1953 ) is a former American football running back , kickoff returner and punt returner who played for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1973 – 1975 , and professionally for the New York Giants ( 1976 @-@ 1977 ) and St. Louis Cardinals ( 1978 ) of the National Football League ( NFL ) . 
 Bell was a two @-@ time All @-@ Ohio running back in high school and led Ohio 's Troy High School to undefeated seasons in 1970 and 1971 . As a 16 @-@ year @-@ old junior , he rushed for 324 yards in a single game ; for the year he had 1 @,@ 593 yards rushing and scored 146 points . As a senior in 1971 , he lost the Ohio AAA high school back of the year award to Archie Griffin . 
 Bell played tailback for Michigan teams that had a combined record of 28 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 from 1973 – 1975 . As a junior in 1974 , Bell was a part @-@ time player who started only three of Michigan 's eleven games , but he still managed to become only the third player in school history to rush for 1 @,@ 000 yards in a season . In 1975 , he set several single @-@ season school records , including most all @-@ purpose yards ( 1 @,@ 714 yards ) , most 100 @-@ yard rushing games ( eight ) , and most rushing attempts ( 273 ) . At the time of his graduation from Michigan , Bell also ranked second in school history in career rushing yards and third in all @-@ purpose yards . Though Bell 's records have been surpassed in more recent years , he remains one of the all @-@ time rushing leaders in Michigan history . Despite his accomplishments , Bell played in the shadow of Big Ten Conference rival , Archie Griffin , who won back @-@ to @-@ back Heisman Trophies . In some respects , Bell exceeded even Griffin 's accomplishments , as Bell won the 1975 Big Ten rushing championship . 
 Bell played three years of professional football , but never made it into the starting lineup for an NFL team . In three NFL seasons , he had 1 @,@ 444 all @-@ purpose yards . His best NFL season was 1976 , when he had 784 all @-@ purpose yards .

 A native of Troy , Ohio , Bell had attended Ohio State Buckeyes games with his father from the age of six . In high school , he was one of the top football prospects in Ohio . As a junior at Troy High School in 1970 , Bell gained over 1 @,@ 593 yards , scored 146 points , led Troy High to its first unbeaten season ( 10 @-@ 0 ) since 1957 , and was named to the Associated Press 1970 All @-@ Ohio Class AAA high school first team . In the 1970 season opener , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Bell rushed for 324 yards and scored four touchdowns in a 54 – 6 win over Piqua High School . Afterward , Bell said , " All I can say is that my line was tremendous . " Piqua 's coach said , " Our kids were on Bell from the start , but they just couldn 't bring him down . " In October 1970 , Bell put on " one of the greatest one @-@ man shows ever seen at Beavercreek , " scoring three touchdowns and rushing for 233 yards in 30 carries . The Beavercreek coach said afterward that the game 's turning point came the moment Bell walked onto the field . 
 As a senior in 1971 , Bell led Troy High to a 10 – 0 record . In the season opener , Bell broke off tackle and rushed 70 yards for a touchdown the first time he got the ball . He scored touchdowns in three of his first four carries , though one was nullified by a penalty . Bell rushed for 190 yards and three touchdowns in the season opener . The opposing coach said , " It was the same old story . We knew we had to stop Bell and yet we still couldn 't do it . That boy is a great football player . " Bell again won first @-@ team All @-@ Ohio honors , but he lost the Associated Press 1971 Ohio AAA high school back of the year award . The award instead went to a high school senior from Columbus , Archie Griffin . Bell and Griffin would continue their rivalry in college . 
 In 1971 , Bell also won the Piqua YMCA high school weight @-@ lifting contest in the 165 @-@ pound class .

 Bell was recruited to the University of Michigan by assistant coach Gary Moeller . He was a relatively small player , standing 5 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) tall , and weighing 178 pounds ( 81 kg ; 12 @.@ 7 st ) . He was sometimes referred to as Michigan 's " mighty mite tailback . " In addition to his speed , what set him apart from other backs was his ability to cut and find the smallest of holes . Bo Schembechler called Bell " the greatest cutback runner I 've ever coached . " In 1975 , the Associated Press noted : " Bell is noted for his ability to cut on a dime , spurt through <unk> [ sic ] holes and hurdle tacklers . He 's got fine speed and he 's durable . Bell seems to get -- pardon the expression -- his bell rung on many tackles , only to bounce up as if nothing happened . " Noted Michigan radio broadcaster Bob Ufer often referred to Bell as " little Gordie Bell . " Ufer once humorously said , referring to Bell 's ability to shift directions quickly , that Bell " could run fifteen minutes in a phone booth and never touch the sides . " 
 In his career at Michigan , Bell gained 2 @,@ 902 rushing yards in 535 carries , and scored 28 rushing touchdowns . In addition to running from scrimmage , Bell ran back 12 kickoffs for an average of 26 @.@ 4 yards .

 As a sophomore in 1973 , Bell saw his first action against Iowa . He was given five carries and gained 50 yards ( including a 24 @-@ yard gain ) for a ten @-@ yard per carry average . Bell did not start any games in 1973 , but his playing time increased later in the season , including 19 carries against Minnesota for 73 yards and 15 carries against Indiana for 89 yards . For the season , Bell rushed for 464 yards in 88 carries . The 1973 team finished with a record of 10 – 0 – 1 , with the only imperfection coming at the end of the season with a 10 – 10 tie with Ohio State . Despite tying for the Big Ten Conference championship , Big Ten athletic directors decided to send Ohio State to the Rose Bowl , and conference rules did not permit Michigan to play in another bowl game . Michigan ended up ranked number 6 in the final Associated Press poll . 
 = = = 1974 season = = = 
 For the 1974 season , Bell rushed for 1048 yards which was , at that time , the third highest single @-@ season total in school history . He joined Ron Johnson and Billy Taylor as the only players in Michigan history to rush for 1 @,@ 000 yards in a season . Bell accomplished the feat despite being a part @-@ time player , sharing the starting tailback job with sophomore Rob Lytle . In the 1974 campaign , Lytle started eight games to Bell 's three , although Bell <unk> Lytle 1048 yards to 802 . Bell had lost about 10 pounds ( 4 @.@ 5 kg ; 0 @.@ 71 st ) in the summer before the 1974 season , dropping to 175 pounds ( 79 kg ; 12 @.@ 5 st ) . He said , " I did it on my own to help me run , to make me quicker . " 
 Asked in 1974 about his alternating Lytle and Bell at the tailback position , Bo Schembechler said : " They 're both good . They have equal ability and they both deserve to play . " , Bell said at the time that he did not mind sharing playing time with Lytle because " we 're both pretty fair backs . It 's only fair that we share it . " In an October 1974 win over Minnesota ( by a score of 49 – 0 ) , Bell and Lytle combined for 292 rushing yards — 158 for Lytle and 134 for Bell . 
 In Michigan 's 51 – 0 victory over Purdue in November 1974 , Bell rushed for 166 yards in 22 carries for a 7 @.@ 2 yards per carry average . He also set up a field goal and another touchdown with runs of 32 and 39 yards . Bell was named the UPI 's Midwest offensive player of the week for the effort . When a reporter asked Bell for a comment , he said , " Coach doesn 't want us to say anything this week . We 've got to get ready for Ohio State . " 
 After Bell and Lytle combined for 1 @,@ 850 rushing yards in 1974 , Schembechler said : " Bell and Lytle are the greatest combination in the country . Bell is the best cut runner I 've ever had . Lytle is a great power runner . The tailback position is healthy to say the least . " 
 = = = 1975 season = = = 
 In both 1975 , Bell again shared the Michigan backfield duties with Rob Lytle . Bell was a senior in 1975 on a Michigan team that went 8 – 2 – 2 and finished the season ranked # 8 in the final Associated Press poll . Bell rushed for 1 @,@ 390 yards , added 314 yards on kickoff returns , and was voted the team 's Most Valuable Player . 
 Michigan started the 1975 season ranked # 3 in the country , and moved into the # 2 spot with a 23 – 6 win over Wisconsin in the season opener . Despite being hampered by a muscle pull , Bell still rushed for 210 yards in 28 carries against Wisconsin . After the game , Bell noted that he " couldn 't cut as well as ( he ) would have liked , " but he played through the injury realizing that , as a senior , " the coaches expect us to show the way . " On being named the UPI 's Midwest Back of the Week , Bell noted , " It 's really an honor to be recognized like that , but you have to have a lot of help out there . I thought Rick Leach was just super in the game . He sure didn 't look like a freshman . And our offensive line did the job despite having so many sophomores in there . " Bell 's 210 @-@ yard performance against Wisconsin stood as the school record in a season opener for 28 years until Chris Perry rushed for 232 yards in the 2003 season opener against Central Michigan . 
 After the opener against Wisconsin , Bell and the Wolverines tied games against Stanford ( 19 – 19 ) and Baylor ( 14 – 14 ) . Despite being favored by 18 points over Baylor , the Wolverines nearly lost and fell out of the top 10 in national ranking for the first time since September 1972 . After the Baylor game , Schembechler said the team lacked leadership . Bell may have been the one player to whom Bo 's criticism did not apply , as he had a career @-@ long 64 @-@ yard kickoff return against Baylor , scored both of Michigan 's touchdowns , and rushed for 89 yards in 26 carries . Bell 's second touchdown against Baylor came with 6 : 50 remaining in the fourth quarter and saved the Wolverines from a defeat . 
 The Wolverines rebounded into the top 10 with a 31 – 7 victory over Missouri in the fourth game of the season and strung together seven straight wins before facing Ohio State . Bell rushed for 119 yards against Missouri and had 150 all @-@ purpose yards . In a 16 – 6 win over Michigan State in week five , Bell scored Michigan 's only touchdown on a 19 @-@ yard run in the fourth quarter . The Wolverines beat Northwestern Wildcats , 69 – 0 , in week six . For the first time in Michigan history , the Wolverines had three backs who each rushed for at least 100 yards . As the starting back , Bell rushed for 100 yards and scored two touchdowns in the first quarter alone . With the game turning into a blowout , Schembechler pulled Bell after the first quarter , and Rob Lytle gained another 105 yards , before being replaced by Harlan <unk> who gained 157 yards . Michigan tied the modern Big Ten record of 573 rushing yards in the game . 
 In a 28 – 21 win against Minnesota , Bell rushed for 174 yards on 31 carries for his fifth consecutive 100 @-@ yard game . He also scored two touchdowns , including a 23 @-@ yard run midway through the fourth quarter . The UPI noted : " Bell 's clinching run came with 8 : 04 gone in the final quarter and saved Michigan from the embarrassment of a tie . " Bell 's performance in the Minnesota game gave him 2 @,@ 488 career rushing yards , second in school history to Billy Taylor 's record of 3 @,@ 072 yards . In a close 21 – 15 win over Illinois , Bell scored two first @-@ quarter touchdowns and carried the ball a career @-@ high 35 times . Going into the Ohio State game , Bell was in a three @-@ person contest for the Big Ten Conference rushing championship . Bell led with an average of 134 @.@ 1 yards per conference game to 125 @.@ 1 for Billy Marek of Wisconsin , and 123 @.@ 7 for Archie Griffin . 
 Michigan ended the season with a 21 – 14 loss to Ohio State . Despite the loss , Bell won the battle of the backs , rushing for 124 yards on 21 carries and throwing for a touchdown pass , while Griffin was limited to 46 yards on 19 carries . Bell had 166 all @-@ purpose yards against the Buckeyes , his last regular season game for Michigan . In his only bowl game appearance , Bell played in a 14 – 6 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners in Orange Bowl after the 1975 season . He gained 53 yards rushing and 90 all @-@ purpose yards .

 Bell was Michigan 's starting running back in the same years in which Archie Griffin won consecutive Heisman Trophies for Ohio State . In head @-@ to @-@ head meetings in 1974 and 1975 , Bell played as well or better than Griffin . In 1974 , each carried the ball 25 times , and Bell ended up with 108 yards compared with 111 yards for Griffin although Ohio State won the game 12 – 10 . In 1975 , Bell outgained Griffin 124 yards to 46 yards . Bell averaged 132 @.@ 9 yards per game in 1975 to lead Griffin and the Big Ten Conference in conference game rushing . Even so , Griffin won the Heisman Trophy , and Bell finished eighth in the 1975 Heisman Trophy voting . 
 During the 1975 season , Bell was asked how he felt about all the publicity being received by Griffin . He replied : " All of the publicity in the world doesn 't help you win . I don 't feel slighted because Archie is in our conference . I feel I 'm just as good as he is . " Bell later recalled : " Those two games against Ohio State were my biggest , and I consider the second game a personal victory . I <unk> Archie , but he had a great public relations guy in Woody Hayes . . . . He wasn 't the best player in the conference so how can he be the best player in the country ? " 
 Lee Larkins , who played for Purdue and was one of the top defensive backs in the Big Ten , said in 1976 that Bell was the best running back he ever played against . As a senior , Larkins played against Gordon Bell , Archie Griffin , and Ricky Bell of USC . Larkins said : " Gordon Bell was the best of the three . He was a super tough runner and a tough guy to make a solid tackle on . Gordon has a lot more speed and more moves than Archie does , and I thought he was a better all around player . "

Schembechler recalled , " Trenton told me ( Gordon ) ' d be back to finish that course . And he was . " Schembechler added , " Gordie listens to Trenton . What he says gets done . " 
 Schembechler described Gordon Bell as " a very , very durable guy . " Bo noted : " He isn 't exactly frail . He 's put together well . He 's a confident guy . Exciting and good as he is , he 's also one of the nicest guys you 'll ever meet . " 
 As Archie Griffin garnered the lion 's share of the media attention in 1975 , Schembechler spoke out for Bell : " I think Bell 's as good as any back there is anywhere . I haven 't seen any who looks better . . . . He is certainly the most <unk> great back in the country . "

 Bell was drafted by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft . Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants . In late November , columnist David Bushnell wrote an article , " Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell ? , " questioning the team 's lack of utilization of Bell . Bushnell noted that Bell had " spent most of the season standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays . " The Giants ' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar , though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back : " Bell is quick , with speed to break any play for a long gain , and he can catch the ball . . . . If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually , they might just miss the boat totally , breaking Bell instead . " Bell noted at the time that the lack of playing time held him back : " It takes me about a quarter or so to get going , break a sweat and get the legs loosened up . I really don 't like being shuffled in and out so much , but as a rookie I can 't do much about it . " Bell also added , " Sure it 's been hard for me to be a spot player , especially because my body isn 't ideal for that type job . I think it 's better for me to play a lot , but then again I 'm not the coach . " 
 The 1976 Giants , who started 0 – 7 under Bill <unk> before going 3 – 4 under John McVay , had a diversified offense in which Bell was second on the team with 25 receptions for 198 yards . When Kotar was injured , Bell got his first start of the 1976 season on November 27 , 1976 . Bell rushed for two touchdowns in a 28 @-@ 16 victory over the Seattle Seahawks . He posted the best day of his professional career , with touchdown runs of two and 21 yards , gaining 56 yards on the ground and 41 more on pass receptions . After the game , Bell said , " I needed a game like that . " The backfield was led by Doug Kotar and Larry Csonka with Bell being the third leading rusher . 
 Having seen little playing time as a rookie in 1976 , Bell played even less in 1977 , as the Giants worked Bob Hammond and Willie Spencer into the rushing rotation . Bell rushed for 63 yards in 16 carries for the entire 1977 season . His main contribution to the 1977 Giants was as a kickoff returner , as he returned 12 kickoffs for 235 yards , second best on the Giants after Hammond .

 = Ontario Highway 406 = 
 King 's Highway 406 ( pronounced " four @-@ oh @-@ six " ) , commonly referred to as Highway 406 , is a 400 @-@ series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . The primary north @-@ south route though the central portion of the Niagara Peninsula , Highway 406 connects Welland , Thorold and downtown St. Catharines to the Queen Elizabeth Way ( QEW ) . 
 Construction of Highway 406 began in 1963 . The first section opened between St. Davids Road and Geneva Street on December 7 , 1965 , followed by a southward extension to Beaverdams Road in late 1969 . The route was later extended south as a super two to Merritt Road where it became Highway 58 . In 1977 , construction began to connect the freeway with the QEW ; this was completed in late 1984 . Construction on the route resumed in 1987 , connecting the route with East Main Street in Welland , completed during the mid @-@ 1990s . 
 In 2009 construction resumed on the highway to expand the remaining two lane sections to a four lane divided freeway , with the existing route becoming the southbound lanes of the new freeway . The southern terminus in Welland was converted to a roundabout while the remaining at @-@ grade intersections were rebuilt as interchanges . 
 = = Route description = = 
 From 1987 until 2015 , Highway 406 was unique as the only 400 @-@ series highway with two lane sections and with an at @-@ grade rail crossing . The highway is heavily travelled within St. Catharines , but volumes drop considerably south of the city . The speed limit on Highway 406 varies from 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) to 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) . It is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police . 
 The 406 designation begins at East Main Street in Welland at a roundabout immediately west of East Main Street Tunnel beneath the Welland Canal . From here the now @-@ four @-@ lane divided road veers northeast and travels parallel to the canal . Two golf courses separate the canal . As the highway passes to the west of them , it jogs to the west and crosses a Trillium Railway spur ( formerly at @-@ grade , now over the railroad ) , and meets Daimler Parkway and Woodlawn Road at a newly constructed interchange . Soon after , it crosses the Welland River and then the former channel of the canal , which was replaced by the current Welland By @-@ Pass in the 1970s . 
 The highway curves to the northwest as it passes through thick forest , and meets another newly built interchange with Merritt Road ( formerly Highway 58 ) , which as of 2009 was being rebuilt as a grade @-@ separated interchange . After this , it returns to its northward orientation and passes the final at @-@ grade intersection ( now an overpass ) , Niagara Regional Road 63 ( Port Robinson Road ) . 
 North of Port Robinson Road , Highway 406 widens to four lanes and a median opens in the centre , making it a controlled access freeway . The forests break and the freeway continues straight north for 7 km ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) through a mostly agricultural area . Along the straightaway are interchanges with former Highway 20 and Niagara Regional Road 67 ( Beaverdams Road ) . The freeway crosses over Lake Gibson , infamous for its connection with the crimes of Paul Bernardo , and curves to the northeast . It passes beneath Niagara Regional Road 71 ( St. Davids Road ) and Highway 58 at a complicated interchange as it descends the Niagara Escarpment , a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve , and enters St. Catharines . 
 Within St. Catharines , Highway 406 twists frequently , entering the Twelve Mile Creek valley south of a complicated interchange with Westchester Avenue and Geneva Street and curving west . Within the valley , the freeway features a lower design speed and reduced speed limit of 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) . It passes beneath the high @-@ level St. Paul Street bridge , crosses the creek and intersects Fourth Avenue . Exiting the creek valley , the freeway parallels Fourth Avenue for a 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) , gradually curves to the north and ends 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to the north , merging with the QEW .

 Planning for Highway 406 began in early 1959 , when Minister of Highways Fred M. Cass presented the Ontario Roads and Streets report to the Ontario Legislative Assembly on March 16 , outlining highways needs for the province over 20 years . One of the planned routes was a freeway to link Highway 3 in Port Colborne with the QEW , travelling alongside the Welland Canal . By 1961 , route studies and planning were well underway . The future route was designated as Highway 406 despite construction not beginning until 1963 ; the first section , between Geneva Street and St. Davids Road , opened December 7 , 1965 . This was followed several years later by an extension south to Beaverdams Road , which opened November 21 , 1969 . During the early 1970s , the highway was extended south as a Super 2 to north of the Welland River , where it curved west along Merritt Road and became Highway 58 . This extension , which included the Beaverdams Road interchange and a signalized intersection , was opened on June 30 , 1971 . 
 In 1977 , construction began on the section of Highway 406 between Geneva Street and the QEW . This work included the construction of several large bridges over the widened ravine , a curving structure over Twelve Mile Creek , and the first single @-@ point urban interchange ( SPUI ) in Ontario ( the only other SPUI is located on Airport Parkway in Ottawa ) . The original design plans for Highway 406 called for this section to follow the creek valley the full distance to the QEW , interchanging with it east of Martindale Road . Instead , the alignment was moved west of the city . Realignments to several streets in St. Catharines were completed in advance of construction on overpasses , ramps and the bridges over Twelve Mile Creek ; this work was finished in late 1983 . Grading contracts were awarded in mid @-@ 1983 for the entire extension . Paving took place during the summer of 1984 , and the route was opened to traffic in October 1984 . 
 Further work to extend the future southbound lanes Highway 406 to East Main Street in Welland began during the fall of 1987 , including an eastward extension of Woodlawn Road . Construction of the bridges that carry the extension over the Welland River and old canal began in mid @-@ 1988 , and was completed during the fall of 1989 . Work then began to grade and pave the Woodlawn Road Extension to Highway 406 and Highway 406 between there and East Main Street . The extension was completed by the mid @-@ 1990s . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 Highway 406 was the last 400 @-@ series highway that featured at @-@ grade intersections and two lane sections . The original intention was to twin this two @-@ lane section shortly after it was constructed in the 1970s . Plans were deferred multiple times , until the project resumed in the early 2000s . The first phase of this twinning opened to traffic in 2007 , extending the four @-@ lane highway 5 @.@ 6 km ( 3 @.@ 5 mi ) from its previous convergence south of Beaverdams Road to a point north of Port Robinson Road . 
 On May 15 2009 , Minister of Transportation Jim Bradley announced that the section from Port Robinson road to East Main Street in Welland would be converted to a full freeway ; this work includes a roundabout at East Main Street to replace the current southern terminus . Work on the Merritt Road overpass began in September 2009 , and was scheduled for completion in mid @-@ 2011 . On August 19 , 2011 , full construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony . The roundabout with East Main Street opened to traffic on September 5 , 2013 , featuring no central island . Despite requests from local politicians , there are no plans to extend Highway 406 to Port Colborne at this time . 
 = = Exit list = = 
 Highway 406 's northern terminus is tied at the QEW , whereas the southern terminus has been relocated in various proposals . As a result , exits were unconventionally numbered from north to south . The entirety of Highway 406 is located within the Regional Municipality of Niagara . 
 = Hurricane Elena = 
 Hurricane Elena was an unpredictable and damaging tropical cyclone that affected eastern and central portions of the United States Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985 . Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend , Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path , triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent . The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana , though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas . Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba , and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact , it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen . Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast , the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30 , then stalled just 50 mi ( 80 km ) west of Cedar Key , Florida . Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida , the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours , causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves , before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi , Mississippi , on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane . The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4 . 
 The hurricane 's unpredictable shifts in direction created what was considered the largest peacetime evacuation in the nation 's history . Evacuations occurred in sequence to follow the storm 's forecast positions , and many residents and tourists along portions of the Gulf Coast were forced to leave twice in a matter of days . Preparations were generally timely and efficient , though accommodations and resources at storm shelters were stretched thin , and many refugees tried to return home against officials ' orders . About 1 @.@ 25 million people fled the storm in Florida alone , contributing to a region @-@ wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees . Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were continuously issued and adjusted , and forecasters stressed the storm 's destructive potential for days . 
 Elena 's slow movement off western Florida resulted in severe beach erosion and damage to coastal buildings , roads , and seawalls , especially to those of old or inadequate construction . Destruction was greatest near the shore and on islands such as Cedar Key and Dog Island , though tornadoes spawned by the hurricane swept through communities and mobile home parks well inland . The hurricane devastated the Apalachicola Bay shellfish industry , killing large quantities of oysters , destroying their reefs , and leaving thousands of workers unemployed . Farther west , Dauphin Island in Alabama endured wind gusts as high as 130 mph ( 210 km / h ) and a significant storm surge . The island sustained some of the most significant damage inflicted by Elena , including several hundred damaged or demolished homes . The rest of the state 's coast also sustained considerable damage , and the inland pecan and soybean crops were severely diminished in Alabama and Mississippi . 
 Over 13 @,@ 000 homes were damaged in Mississippi , and 200 were destroyed . Cities close to the Alabama border — including Pascagoula — experienced widespread damage to residences , schools , and businesses , and the community of Gautier was effectively isolated from the outside world . Several apparent but unconfirmed tornadoes appear to have exacerbated the damage in the Gulfport area . Wind damage extended into portions of eastern Louisiana . Overall , nine people died as a result of the hurricane : two in Texas due to drownings in rip currents , three in Florida , two in Louisiana , one in Arkansas , and one in a maritime accident in the Gulf of Mexico . Damage totaled about $ 1 @.@ 3 billion , and power outages from the storm affected 550 @,@ 000 people . In Elena 's wake , President Ronald Reagan declared parts of Alabama , Mississippi , and Florida federal disaster areas , making storm victims eligible for financial aid and temporary housing . The name Elena was later retired from the cyclical list of Atlantic hurricane names because of the storm 's effects . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Elena trace to an easterly tropical wave that was first identified off the western coast of Africa on August 23 , 1985 . The system sped westward across the Atlantic at up to 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) . Its rapid motion , combined with the presence of an unusually hostile Saharan Air Layer , prevented tropical cyclogenesis for several days . Driven by a strong subtropical ridge to its north , the wave quickly approached North America as it began to show signs of organization . At 00 : 00 UTC on August 28 , the disturbance developed into a tropical depression while over the Windward Passage . The newly designated depression began to track west @-@ northwestward over Cuba , which is known to disrupt tropical cyclone development . Despite that , its central barometric pressure continued to deepen , and reconnaissance aircraft found winds exceeding 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) near the center . In response , the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Elena over northern Cuba later on August 28 . 
 After passing north of Havana , Cuba , Elena emerged into the Gulf of Mexico . At 12 : 00 UTC on August 29 , Elena intensified into a Category 1 hurricane . Analysis of steering currents through the morning of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track , striking the area between New Orleans , Louisiana , and Biloxi , Mississippi within 30 hours . Unexpectedly , a mid @-@ to @-@ upper @-@ level trough of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents , allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed . Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity , the storm abruptly turned east in response to the trough . Having defied initial forecasts , Hurricane Elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest Florida . Forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic . However , the relatively weak trough moved rapidly , and instead of fully engaging Elena , its axis passed over the storm 's center . Further , post @-@ storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments . 
 Extrapolation from the storm 's eastward progress yielded a projected landfall location near Levy County . However , after the passage of the upper @-@ level system early on August 31 , steering currents slackened , and Elena became nearly stationary in the extreme northeastern Gulf of Mexico . At its closest , the center of the storm was around 50 mi ( 80 km ) from Cedar Key , Florida , with maximum sustained winds estimated at 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) . Elena 's intensity remained consistent , and the cyclone was able to continue strengthening as soon as movement resumed . Early on September 1 , Elena reached Category 3 major hurricane status . An area of high pressure soon began to build over the eastern United States , causing Elena to slowly retrograde westward . For much of September 1 , the center of the hurricane was within range of the WSR @-@ 57 radar station in Apalachicola , Florida , enabling extensive study of small features within the eye and surrounding eyewall . During that period of observation , the previously unobstructed eye became cloud @-@ filled . 
 The hurricane accelerated on a trajectory toward the central U.S. Gulf Coast , sliding south of the Florida Panhandle . During the afternoon of September 1 , the hurricane attained its peak intensity , with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) as confirmed by reconnaissance aircraft . On the morning of September 2 , Elena approached coastal Mississippi from the east @-@ southeast , still at major hurricane status . It came ashore close to Biloxi , which was coincidentally within the hurricane 's first forecast destination range before its extended detour . Once inland , the hurricane immediately deteriorated , weakening to a tropical storm just hours after landfall , and its center rapidly filled . The system curved northwestward over Mississippi and Louisiana , and despite weakening , it continued to ignite thunderstorm activity which spawned heavy rains . Elena persisted for several days before degenerating into a remnant area of low pressure on September 4 . Its associated cloud structure became distorted on September 5 , and dissipated over Kentucky that same night . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The unpredictable nature of the hurricane , in conjunction with its arrival at popular tourist destinations on the Labor Day holiday weekend , severely complicated preparations along the Gulf Coast . Evacuations and the hoisting of weather advisories inadvertently occurred in stages to keep up with Elena 's shifts in direction ; hurricane warnings were in effect at one point or another for every coastal location between Morgan City , Louisiana , and Sarasota , Florida . Much of the northern Gulf Coast was under a hurricane warning on two separate occasions for two different trajectories of the storm . Evacuations of residents and vacationers also overlapped in many cases . Collectively , this led to the " largest number of people ever evacuated " , according to Robert Case . Some evacuees moved inland to meet relatives , but many stayed relatively local , filling hotels and designated shelters such as schools and churches . Despite the unusually fluid scenario , officials were well aware of the storm 's destructive power days before its actual landfall . National Hurricane Center hurricane expert Bob Sheets cautioned on August 30 that Elena " will be over a $ 1 billion storm " . 
 During Elena 's initial approach , the first series of hurricane warnings were issued between Grand Isle , Louisiana , and Apalachicola , Florida . The storm 's projected path quickly nudged westward , prompting the warnings to be extended to Morgan City , Louisiana , and truncated to Pensacola , Florida on their eastern reach . Heeding the advisories , nearly one million residents and vacationers fled the storm 's path . Personnel on offshore oil rigs in the northern Gulf of Mexico began leaving as early as August 29 . The governors of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida declared states of emergency by August 30 . Huge crowds formed at stores as individuals searched for emergency supplies , and simultaneously , lines grew at gas stations . Due to the impending danger , many businesses closed and fortified their buildings . Across the Gulf Coast , classes at schools were cancelled , and residents in the New Orleans area were particularly wary of what was being called the first serious hurricane threat in 20 years ( Hurricane Betsy caused catastrophic flooding in and around New Orleans in 1965 ) . In Mississippi , the mass exodus created bumper @-@ to @-@ bumper traffic on crucial highways , such as the west – east U.S. Route 90 . In Florida , then @-@ Governor Bob Graham activated 250 National Guard troops on August 30 to facilitate efficient evacuations , stating that 1 @,@ 600 more were on standby . By that time , it became evident that Elena would head farther east than initially expected , stirring more concern for the eastern Gulf Coast . Accordingly , hurricane warnings were dropped for coastal Louisiana west of Grand Isle and replaced eastward to Apalachicola , Florida . 
 By the evening of August 30 , after Elena 's sharp turn to the east , hurricane warnings along most of the northern Gulf Coast were discontinued . In accordance , evacuees between Louisiana and the four westernmost counties of the Florida Panhandle returned home as shelters closed . With the storm 's new course , the area of highest threat translated east to the remainder of the Panhandle and the western Florida Peninsula . As such , Governor Graham recommended evacuations south to the Tampa area late on August 30 . A mandatory evacuation was then issued overnight for ten more coastal counties , encompassing 573 @,@ 000 affected individuals . On August 31 , Governor Graham advised residents in vulnerable areas of 15 inland counties to find safer ground . In response to the heightening danger , most of the National Guard troops previously on standby were sent to block access to certain areas , and an additional 3 @,@ 000 were placed on standby . 
 In the greater St. Petersburg , Pinellas County , area alone , 320 @,@ 000 people evacuated ahead of the storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history . The large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities , highways , and contingencies . Although the number of people required to leave far exceeded the capacity of Pinellas County shelters , only 120 @,@ 000 of the 300 @,@ 000 or more refugees made use of the shelters . Still , official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average , possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and relatives , or increased awareness of available resources . Post @-@ storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90 % in Pinellas County , and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours , rather than the expected 15 . With over 200 @,@ 000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west @-@ central Florida , evacuees became restless as a result of the duration of the storm . Supplies such as food ran short , and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely . The threat of Hurricane Elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients . Tampa General Hospital , at 84 % of patient capacity , was evacuated ; four more hospitals and around 19 nursing homes in Pinellas County were also cleared . Overall , nearly 2 @,@ 000 nursing home patients were transported to safety . Although successful , the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortages . 
 Late on September 1 , when the storm began to retrograde , hurricane warnings were reinstated westward along the coast to Grand Isle , Louisiana , as advisories along the west coast of the Florida Peninsula were allowed to expire . By the time officials lifted evacuation orders , the number of evacuees staying in shelters already decreased significantly due to the rampant eagerness and anxiety . Roughly 250 @,@ 000 people in the Florida Panhandle , 175 @,@ 000 in Alabama , 70 @,@ 000 in Mississippi , and 50 @,@ 000 in Louisiana — a total of 545 @,@ 000 — were ordered to leave . Several hundred thousand of the people affected by the new string of evacuation orders had also been forced to leave just days earlier , and in extreme cases had one day or less reprieve . Governor Graham 's office reported that during the entire storm event , 1 @.@ 25 million people from Florida evacuated at some point , and state police in Louisiana estimated that figure in their state to be around 400 @,@ 000 . In total , nearly 2 million people fled the storm over its entire course . 
 = = Impact = = 
 According to the Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory , Hurricane Elena produced Category 3 winds ( 111 mph ( 179 km / h ) or greater ) in Florida , Alabama , and Mississippi . The American Red Cross reported that in addition to the hundreds of single @-@ family homes demolished by the hurricane , over 17 @,@ 000 sustained some degree of damage ; thousands of mobile homes , apartments , and condominiums were also damaged or destroyed . A forecaster at the National Hurricane Center determined the worst of the hurricane 's effects were focused around Dauphin Island , Alabama , and Pascagoula , Mississippi , though noteworthy damage occurred across large areas of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida , with impacts documented as far west as South Padre Island , Texas , and as far north as Kentucky . Nine deaths were attributed to the hurricane in four states and on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico , and 134 people along Elena 's path were hospitalized , many of them due to storm @-@ related stress . Power outages plagued the entire region , affecting about 550 @,@ 000 customers . The National Climatic Data Center compiled a total monetary damage figure of $ 1 @.@ 3 billion . 
 In addition to its effects over land , Elena also had an impact on offshore interests . When a cargo ship close to the hurricane 's center rolled in high seas on August 29 , two unsecured storage containers collided , crushing a man to death . An oil platform operated by Exxon and anchored off the coast of Pensacola , Florida , was ripped from its moorings and reported missing on September 2 . The oil rig drifted 14 mi ( 23 km ) away before it was spotted by a Coast Guard aircraft . Exxon previously evacuated the platform after rough seas snapped the first two of its eight anchoring cables . Damage was reported on four other offshore platforms , and a 6 in ( 150 mm ) oil pipeline broke during the hurricane at an estimated cost of $ 1 @.@ 6 million ( the same pipeline broke two more times during the 1985 hurricane season ) . 
 A large aspect of the hurricane 's devastation was the havoc it wrought on the eastern Gulf of Mexico oyster industry , particularly in the Apalachicola Bay area and off the coast of Alabama . Elena subjected the Apalachicola Bay reefs to high winds , strong tidal action , and moderate to heavy rainfall , churning up huge quantities of silt and mud which suffocated up to 90 % of live oysters and virtually destroyed the most important harvesting sites . Commercial harvesting was suspended until May 1986 , at which time some of the prominent reefs of the eastern Apalachicola Bay system were deemed able to sustain oyster @-@ catching . Low astronomical tides amplified the effects of severe turbulence in the water . Thousands of individuals relying on the Apalachicola Bay oyster industry soon found themselves struggling to make a living ; losses in production at two major reefs were expected to surpass $ 30 million . All of Alabama 's major reefs were affected by the hurricane , and its most productive was nearly destroyed . The problem was later confounded in November by Hurricane Kate , which , according to the National Hurricane Center , " [ dealt ] the final blow " to certain oyster beds . 
 = = = Florida = = = 
 The storm began affecting Florida late on August 28 and early on August 29 . In Key West , on the east side of Elena 's strengthening center , wind gusts exceeded 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , accompanied by 1 @.@ 8 in ( 46 mm ) of rain and higher @-@ than @-@ normal tides . Several boats washed ashore at Smathers Beach . Similarly adverse conditions occurred throughout rest of the Keys and across the southern Florida Peninsula ; 60 mph ( 100 km / h ) wind gusts and modest rainfall stretched as far east as the Miami area . Easterly winds produced significant wave heights of 5 @.@ 2 ft ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) at West Palm Beach and 10 @.@ 5 ft ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) at Jacksonville , along the Atlantic coast of Florida , by August 31 . 
 Outer rainbands of the large hurricane produced squally weather over parts of northern Florida as early as the morning of August 30 . By then , the low @-@ lying coastline near Apalachicola already began to flood . Elena would continue to impact the state for several days as it meandered offshore , resulting in moderate to heavy rainfall . Upwards of 10 in ( 250 mm ) accumulated in many locations , peaking at 15 @.@ 67 in ( 398 mm ) near Cross City and reaching 11 @.@ 31 in ( 287 mm ) at Apalachicola . Farther south in the Tampa area , the precipitation was less significant , exceeding 5 in ( 130 mm ) at Clearwater . Parts of the state 's northeastern coast — farther away from the hurricane 's center — also saw formidable rainfall , with a local maximum of 10 @.@ 57 in ( 268 mm ) at Jacksonville . Still , those totals represented a relatively dry storm , considering its long duration . Despite initial hopes that the hurricane would help alleviate drought conditions across interior portions of southern Florida , precipitation there was generally inconsequential . 
 Storm @-@ heightened tides extended along the Florida coast as far south as Sarasota and generally ran a modest 3 to 6 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 to 1 @.@ 83 m ) above normal , though their duration and extent proved noteworthy . The highest recorded storm surge associated with the hurricane was 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) at Apalachicola . The combination of raised water levels and strong waves resulted in severe erosion along many beaches . Many homes near the water were destroyed by the surge , and shoreline structures such as docks , causeways , bridges , low @-@ lying roads , and seawalls sustained substantial damage . Several large fishing piers were either partially or totally destroyed ; notably , the city pier at Cedar Key and the popular 1 @,@ 500 ft ( 460 m ) Big Indian Rocks Fishing Pier were both demolished by the hurricane . Debris from the Big Indian Rocks Fishing Pier drifted northward toward Clearwater Pass and accumulated along private beaches at <unk> Shore . 
 The storm 's strongest winds remained largely over open waters , although severe gusts still brushed coastal cities and barrier islands . The strongest winds were observed in two areas of the coast : from Cedar Key to Clearwater , and from Apalachicola to Pensacola . Official gust reports included 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) at Cedar Key and nearly 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) at Clearwater ; later , on September 2 , a gust of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) was observed at Pensacola along the Florida Panhandle , with sustained winds exceeding 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . Winds in Franklin County approached 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) by unofficial estimates . The storm 's effects were not limited to the shore , however , as fallen trees in the inland Tallahassee area damaged around 50 vehicles . 
 Though Hurricane Elena never crossed Florida 's coast , its drawn @-@ out interaction with land agitated large swaths of the state 's western shore . Winds along and around the Pinellas County coast generally blew from the south or southwest for several days , creating persistent onshore flow that built up heavy seas . Near Clearwater , waves reached 8 @.@ 2 ft ( 2 @.@ 5 m ) in height , marked by a period of 13 seconds on August 31 . One study determined that the storm removed an average of 10 cubic yards of coastal material per linear foot of shoreline in Escambia County , Gulf , Franklin , and Pinellas counties , with values peaking at 15 @.@ 6 cubic yards per foot . Along the predominantly marshy coasts of Pasco , Hernando , and Citrus counties , erosion and structural damage were much more limited , partly due to the local southerly or southeasterly wind direction . 
 In some cases , the hurricane left quasi @-@ permanent alterations on beaches and small islands . For example , North <unk> Key — an island of southern Pinellas County — lost most of its vegetation to the storm , and <unk> shifted the southern part of the island up to 330 ft ( 100 m ) from its original settlement . More extensive changes were seen on and near <unk> Island , which formed in 1921 after a hurricane split a larger barrier island into two by a new channel . The inlet became dominant over Dunedin Pass to the south , which grew narrower very gradually until Elena rearranged the dynamics of the beach , allowing Dunedin Pass to fill completely with sand within a couple years of the hurricane 's passage . As a result , Clearwater Beach became connected to <unk> Island . Elena also created a new inlet known as Willy 's Cut , which existed until 1991 . Interest in artificially reopening Dunedin Pass prompted an official study in 1994 on the engineering and financial merits of such a project . Due to the high cost of dredging and the likelihood of nearly continuous maintenance , no action was taken . 
 The hurricane tore two barges from their moorings in Tampa Bay and blew them into Gandy Bridge , leaving the bridge with unspecified damage . Throughout the area , rising waters inundated streets , washed boats ashore , and destroyed numerous homes along the coast . At low @-@ lying Cedar Key to the north , storm surge exceeded 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) . There , and at Alligator Point to the northwest , the surge values represented return periods of 25 to 30 years ; elsewhere , they were equivalent to about 10 @-@ year events . Floodwaters in Cedar Key rose to 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) in depth , with 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) waves atop the standing water . The extent of structural damage was largely dependent on construction type , as newer , elevated buildings fared much better than older structures nearer sea level . Waterfront restaurants were especially susceptible ; winds blew out several large sliding @-@ glass doors at one establishment , allowing both the winds and the tide to enter its interior . Elena severed the sole bridge to Cedar Key , temporarily isolating the city and stranding several residents . The Florida Department of Transportation hurriedly worked to make the bridge passable long enough to rescue the stranded individuals . The hurricane compromised several other roads , destroying a 75 ft ( 23 m ) section of State Road 24 . Monetary losses in Cedar Key alone were estimated at $ 2 million , and all major aspects of local infrastructure were severely affected , initially preventing residents from returning home to the island . At least 34 homes and businesses on the island were damaged or destroyed . 
 Pinellas County suffered some of the worst damage from Hurricane Elena in Florida . At the height of the storm , over 500 @,@ 000 of its residents were without electricity . Forty @-@ four single @-@ family homes were destroyed , 31 more were damaged , and several condominiums , townhouses , and commercial buildings were damaged or destroyed . The hurricane also wrecked or irreparably compromised nearly 2 @.@ 7 mi ( 4 @.@ 3 km ) of coastal bulkheads and inflicted minor damage on 2 @.@ 15 mi ( 3 @.@ 46 km ) more . Most of the affected seawalls were degrading or poorly reinforced . <unk> with higher standards of construction generally remained intact , though even in those cases , overwash from the Gulf of Mexico topped the barriers and deposited large volumes of sand . The hurricane cost roughly $ 100 million in Pinellas County . 
 Elena 's track parallel to the Florida Panhandle subjected the coastline between Apalachicola and Pensacola Beach to particularly severe conditions that resulted in " significant " property damage there . In Apalachicola proper , winds tore large roofs off buildings , and data from Florida 's Department of Natural Resources indicate that 20 residences and one community building in Franklin County were damaged or destroyed . Structural failure was prevalent along the county 's waterfront and on islands such as Dog Island ; however , it was mainly limited to poorly constructed buildings . Several miles of roadways in the county sustained significant damage , and about 1 ⁄ 2 mile ( 800 m ) of bulkhead was destroyed . Low seawalls allowed crucial points of the causeway to St. George Island to erode , causing it to fail . In Escambia County , the hurricane left $ 2 million in damages . Throughout much of the remainder of the Florida Panhandle , structural damage was limited , though 100 @,@ 000 people in the Pensacola area lost power . The configuration of the southern tip of Cape San Blas in Gulf County was changed by the storm . The hurricane wiped out eagle nests , generated freshwater fish kills , and impacted other species of wildlife at the St. Vincent and St. Marks National Wildlife Refuges . St. George Island and Honeymoon Island State Parks were heavily impacted , with appreciable but lesser damage in numerous other protected areas . U.S. Route 98 , which closely follows the coast in this region , required extensive repairs after being undermined in nearly two dozen locations . 
 When tropical cyclones move over land , they often produce the wind shear and atmospheric instability required for the development of weak , embedded supercell thunderstorms , which can produce tornadoes . These tornadoes are usually weak and short @-@ lived , but still capable of producing significant damage . While centered over the Gulf of Mexico , the eastern side of Hurricane Elena 's circulation spawned several such tornadoes over central Florida . A tornado struck just east of Leesburg on September 1 , destroying 64 single @-@ family houses and mobile homes , and damaging another 118 ; seven people were treated for non @-@ life @-@ threatening injuries . Later that same day , another tornado touched down over downtown Leesburg , with much less damage . In nearby Marion County , tornadic activity destroyed six mobile homes , compromised another 50 residences , and inflicted as much as $ 500 @,@ 000 in total losses , though only minor injuries were reported . At Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 in Cape Canaveral , a weak tornado struck two vehicles near the location where Space Shuttle Atlantis was being prepared for its first flight . A tornado in New Port Richey tore parts of the roof off at least one building and brought down trees , and tornadic activity was also identified in Sumter County . 
 The hurricane took one life in the state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths . In Daytona Beach , a tree struck a parked vehicle , killing a person inside . The exact cause of the tree 's uprooting was unknown , although it may have been hit by lightning or a short @-@ lived tornado . Elsewhere , two individuals died of heart attacks : one while installing storm shutters on his home , and another at a designated shelter . 
 = = = Alabama = = = 
 The center of Elena passed 30 mi ( 50 km ) south of mainland Alabama as it accelerated toward the Gulf Coast , impacting the state 's two @-@ county coast and offshore islands . Wind gusts at Dauphin Island , situated much closer to the hurricane 's eye , were estimated to have reached 130 mph ( 210 km / h ) ; these velocities represented some of the highest experienced on land from the storm , and were strong enough to snap hundreds of large pine trees . Dauphin Island received an 8 @.@ 4 ft ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) storm surge that resulted in substantial flooding and areas of total overwash . Rainfall amounted to just 3 in ( 76 mm ) on the island . 
 With its location close to the storm 's center , Dauphin Island saw the greatest damage in Alabama . Access to the island was shut down during and immediately after the hurricane , slowing the progression of damage assessments . Additionally , the storm cut power and phone services . Post @-@ storm surveys revealed discernible patterns in structural damage on the island ; these included a nearly complete lack of destruction on the heavily wooded eastern end , and damage concentrated closer to the western side and along areas exposed to strong easterly winds . First @-@ hand accounts relayed that in the most severe cases , entire elevated homes were torn from their pilings and swept into the Gulf of Mexico . The number of homes demolished in that manner was informally placed at 50 , though such total building collapses were typically confined to poorly secured buildings . In total , the hurricane destroyed 190 residences on Dauphin Island , accounting for nearly 25 % of all homes , and a further 235 sustained substantial damage . An unofficial and early estimate of losses on the island was $ 30 million . 
 <unk> were markedly lower over mainland Alabama ; Mobile recorded winds of over 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , with gusts as high as 84 mph ( 135 km / h ) . The storm 's angle of approach created strong offshore winds along the mainland , which depressed water levels and limited the extent of positive surge once winds shifted to onshore . Winds from the hurricane took a toll on crops , ruining 8 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 lb ( 3 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 kg ) of pecans and reducing soybean production by 10 % . Farms were still in the process of recovering from Hurricane Frederic in 1979 when Elena struck . 
 Wave action took a toll on the foundations of waterfront structures along the coasts of Baldwin and Mobile counties , where Elena inflicted about $ 715 @,@ 000 worth of damage to roadways . Most damage was concentrated near the shore , where extensive erosion took place , and on islands and minor peninsulas . Farther inland , Elena 's impact was generally limited to downed trees and power lines . The storm destroyed the city boardwalk at Gulf Shores , with the cost of rebuilding expected to approach $ 300 @,@ 000 . Alabama Power reported extensive power outages affecting up to 100 @,@ 000 customers . According to the Insurance Information Institute , storm @-@ related damages in Alabama totaled about $ 100 million . An estimated 300 homes in the state were destroyed by Hurricane Elena , and another 1 @,@ 345 sustained lighter damage .

 Along the coast of Mississippi , where Elena made landfall , the most significant effects of the storm stemmed from its strong winds gusting to over 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) . Recorded gusts included 121 mph ( 195 km / h ) at Gulfport , 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) at Pascagoula , and 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) at Biloxi . Several other weather stations clocked sustained winds at over 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Consistent with the storm 's dry nature , rainfall in the state was mainly light and confined to southern and western areas . Gulfport picked up more than 4 @.@ 5 in ( 110 mm ) , while just over 3 in ( 75 mm ) of rain fell at Natchez . Some streets in Gulfport and Biloxi flooded at the height of the storm . The highest tides ran 6 to 8 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 4 m ) above normal along the coast , reaching 7 @.@ 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) above average at Pascagoula and Ocean Springs . As with Alabama , negative surge values were recorded at the storm 's onset . The tide gauge at Gulfport recorded a water level of 5 @.@ 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) below average early on September 2 , before quickly swelling to 5 @.@ 43 ft ( 1 @.@ 66 m ) above normal . Air pressure reportedly fell so rapidly at Pascagoula ahead of the hurricane 's approaching center that car windows began to shatter . The barometer there bottomed out at 953 mb , the lowest recorded pressure on land in association with the cyclone . 
 The worst of the damage occurred along a 40 mi ( 64 km ) stretch of coastline , particularly in the Pascagoula area and surrounding towns . Elena 's winds damaged most of the schools in Jackson County , and more specifically , every school in Pascagoula was structurally impaired to some degree . Damages to schools in Ocean Springs totaled $ 3 million ; in the same city , the overall conditions following the hurricane were described as worse than those in the prior hurricanes Frederic or Camille . Elena destroyed 20 houses and two supermarkets in Ocean Springs , and several buildings on each city block sustained severe roof damage due to fallen trees . Two shopping centers were destroyed in nearby Gautier , possibly by short @-@ lived tornadoes . A fire captain in Gautier remarked immediately after the storm that he had not yet seen an unharmed building in the city . The community became essentially isolated from the outside world , and quickly began to run short of food , clean water , and gasoline supplies . Initial reports from Pascagoula also indicated that most , or all , of that city 's buildings were damaged . Nearly every business in the city was damaged to the extent that none were able to operate by the time the storm cleared . A post @-@ storm assessment by the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency revealed over 900 businesses in Jackson County sustained damage , contributing to a total of nearly 1 @,@ 500 in the state 's three coastal counties . 
 Harrison and Hancock counties were generally not impacted quite as severely as areas closer to the Alabama border , but the entire area still suffered extensively . In sections of Gulfport , large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes . Debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires , thereby allowing them to spread . Similar destruction was seen to the east at Biloxi , where the hurricane 's winds tore the roofs off many buildings . <unk> communities were in a state of disarray , with large trees uprooted , debris littering the ground , and accumulations of sand on parts of roads like U.S. 90 . Damage to schools in Harrison County — particularly in Gulfport and Biloxi — was extensive . Most homes in the area survived the storm , which was locally estimated to have been a once @-@ in @-@ 50 @-@ year event , with relatively little damage . Several buildings along the coast in the Biloxi area sustained severe damage , but many of the older houses near the Gulf of Mexico there fared remarkably well . Winds brought down large highway signs , in some cases causing damage to nearby buildings . Along the coast , Elena caused beach erosion , damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities , and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports , several of which were closed pending Coast Guard inspection . Winds over inland Pearl River County damaged 350 permanent and mobile homes , and as in Alabama , the hurricane took a large toll on pecan and soybean crops and farms . 
 There were numerous reports in southern Mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane 's effects . Reports in Gulfport indicated that three schools actively being used as hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes . At one location , almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of the structure 's roof collapsed . Another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens ' center , endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows , doors , and part of its roof ; about 20 people required rescue by paramedics . Only minor injuries occurred in association with the possible tornadoes . Teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were scarcely able to uncover sufficient evidence that much of the damage in southern Mississippi had been done by tornadoes . As a result , few of the events were confirmed to have been tornadoes , and it was considered likely that most of the damage in the region was the result of squall @-@ like winds that are part of an intense hurricane 's nature , or potentially localized microbursts . This conclusion was not definitive , however ; indeed , a city official in Biloxi remarked that in situations as extreme as Elena 's onslaught , " when you can 't even see your hand in front of you , it 's very hard to tell if it 's a tornado or the hurricane " . Any unconfirmed tornadoes would have possessed winds equal to or weaker than the hurricane 's synoptic winds . 
 The storm left 80 @,@ 000 customers under the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Power Company without power ; most of Jackson County 's 126 @,@ 000 residents were affected by the outage . Operations at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula were halted due to the power outage and widespread damage to the shipyard 's buildings and cranes ; at least two other shipyards in the state were compromised by the hurricane . Additionally , the storm forced the temporary closure of the Chevron USA refinery at Pascagoula . Facilities at Horn Island in the Gulf Islands National Seashore , Buccaneer State Park , and the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge required repairs following the storm ; at the latter , damages included the cost of healing a Florida sandhill crane 's injured leg . Thirty seafood plants were impaired , and another was destroyed . The Red Cross estimated that 200 single @-@ family houses in the state were destroyed , and some 13 @,@ 200 were damaged , 1 @,@ 200 of them heavily . Additionally , the hurricane demolished 390 mobile homes and damaged another 2 @,@ 290 . The overall cost of damage in Mississippi alone approached $ 1 billion . 
 = = = Louisiana = = = 
 After moving inland , the storm 's northwestward track brought it over the Louisiana border on two separate occasions , first reaching Washington Parish as a minimal hurricane . Winds there were strong enough to bring down hundreds of trees , damaging houses and knocking out power to over 15 @,@ 000 customers in the process . The hurricane also overturned mobile homes and strewn debris throughout communities such as Bogalusa and <unk> in Washington Parish , the hardest @-@ hit area in the state . Downed trees caused damage to 200 homes and another 200 businesses , chiefly near Bogalusa . 
 Winds across the rest of the state were moderate , gusting to around 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) at Slidell on the northeastern shore of Lake Pontchartrain , so damage outside of Washington Parish was sporadic . Throughout the state , at least 40 @,@ 000 electric customers lost power . Located southwest of the storm 's core , New Orleans escaped with little damage and relatively benign weather conditions ; still , the hurricane triggered minor flooding and brought down tree limbs around the city . Levees along the shores of Lake Pontchartrain were able to contain the lake 's large waves , despite initial fears to the contrary . Still , the adverse conditions forced the temporary closure of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway . The storm led to the deaths of two individuals in the state : one due to a drowning in St. Tammany Parish and another in a traffic accident attributed to the weather . Insured and uninsured damages were worth near $ 17 million combined , with an additional $ 500 @,@ 000 in agricultural losses . 
 Elena subjected the Chandeleur Islands to a 6 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) or greater storm surge . The island chain is an important buffer to parts of mainland Louisiana against storms , but is frequently reshaped or shrunken by intense hurricanes . Hurricane Danny and Hurricane Juan also impacted the islands in 1985 . Elena eroded away at least 20 % and possibly up to 40 % of the Chandeleur Islands ' total land mass and cut 30 significant channels into the island chain . Parts of the islands left intact suffered extensive loss of vegetation . The hurricane , along with Danny and Juan , also impacted several other barrier islands , and Elena itself removed as much as 112 ft ( 34 m ) of beach along the island of Grand Isle . 
 = = = Elsewhere = = = 
 Precipitation from Hurricane Elena reached into southern Georgia and parts of South Carolina , with little impact aside from meager drought relief . For several days after landfall , the weakening tropical cyclone produced moderate to heavy rainfall across portions of central and northern Arkansas . Rainfall totals were generally 2 to 4 in ( 51 to 102 mm ) , with locally higher amounts ; Mountain Home , Arkansas received 8 @.@ 95 in ( 227 mm ) of rain , including 6 @.@ 6 in ( 170 mm ) in just three hours on September 4 . Clinton to the south recorded 8 @.@ 6 in ( 220 mm ) . At the state capital of Little Rock , under 3 in ( 76 mm ) of liquid fell . Listed by the National Weather Service among " some of the most significant tropical cyclones to affect Arkansas " , the remnants of Elena triggered flash flooding in parts of four counties ; 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) of standing water submerged streets in downtown Hot Springs . In Mountain Home , floodwaters forced 10 families to evacuate their homes , and one person died after a swollen creek swept her car off a bridge spanning it . 
 Significant rainfall also occurred over parts of western Kentucky , with lighter precipitation in several adjacent states . Over 8 in ( 200 mm ) fell at Paducah , where urban streets and low @-@ lying terrain experienced freshwater flooding Floodwaters 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) deep submerged cars to their windows and infiltrated 40 homes , several businesses , a hotel , and a high school . Localized evacuations and road closures were required , and a person wading in an active creek had to be rescued after the creek swept him downstream . Around 10 @,@ 000 customers lost electric service for a short period due to the storm . Shelters were opened to those displaced by the flooding , but scarcely used . 
 Early in its formative stages , Elena triggered <unk> and thunderstorms over parts of Cuba , The Bahamas , and Hispaniola . Later , the mature hurricane generated strong rip currents as far away as South Padre Island , Texas , where two swimmers drowned in separate incidents over the Labor Day weekend . Both victims were male Texas residents . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Hurricane Elena has a multifaceted legacy ; it is remembered not only for its severe impacts , but also for its unpredictability and the wide extent of pre @-@ storm preparations . Due to its notoriety , the name Elena was retired from the cyclical list of Atlantic hurricane names in the spring of 1986 . Consequently , it will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane . The name was replaced by Erika , which was first used during the 1991 season . 
 = = = Florida = = = 
 The state of Florida received a federal Major Disaster Declaration on September 12 . Franklin , Levy , Manatee , and Pinellas counties — where the storm left 5 @,@ 000 individuals without work — became eligible for federal aid after President Ronald Reagan visited the state and determined that residents in those areas would benefit from assistance such as temporary housing , low @-@ interest loans for rebuilding efforts , and monetary grants . Disaster centers were opened in those four counties as centralized locations for federal , state , and volunteer agencies to operate relief programs . President Reagan later included Hillsborough , Wakulla , and Dixie counties , bringing the total number of Florida counties eligible for federal aid to seven . The deadline for residents of all seven counties to apply for either state or federal assistance was set for November 12 . Several major corporations — including Texaco , Exxon , and J.C. Penney — contacted customers in the affected areas and offered to make special arrangements for their monthly payments if they had been financially impacted by the storm . While only a small number of customers took advantage of the assistance , the companies ' actions were met with highly positive feedback . 
 In the days following the storm , residents of Cedar Key were forbidden from returning to their homes and businesses while washed @-@ out roadways underwent repairs and debris was cleared . Portable toilets were delivered and clean water trucked in for use while the city 's infrastructure was being stabilized . After the city of Cedar Key dropped its participation in the National Flood Insurance Program in early 1984 , leaving residents unable to purchase flood insurance for their property , the city council voted unanimously to return to the program after Hurricane Elena . Tourism decreased significantly in some areas due to prospective travelers ' concerns about the extent of the damage . The hurricane created a 13 % drop in visitors between October 1984 and October 1985 in Pinellas County , marking an early end to the annual " tourist season " , which generally ends after Labor Day weekend ; tourist spending fell accordingly . 
 After the storm , residents were allowed to return to their neighborhoods on a by @-@ town basis . Once authorized to enter their communities , many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians . In turn , dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations . In Pinellas County , laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters . As part of the proposed laws , the county sheriff , as opposed to local officials , would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen . Despite extensive resistance , county commissioners approved the change , giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders . An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies . During Hurricane Elena , intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties . 
 To help the Apalachicola Bay shellfish industry recover , special regulations were put in place to monitor harvests , and $ 2 million was designated toward rehabilitation efforts . Using a portion of the funds , out @-@ of @-@ work oyster catchers were employed to repopulate crucial reefs . The state of Florida also issued a grant to help individuals in the crippled seafood industry make necessary payments . Efforts to help newly unemployed individuals in the shellfish industry continued in the months following the storm ; local Tallahassee musicians organized a benefit concert in January 1986 to raise money for families of oystermen in Franklin County . 
 On September 1 and 2 , Florida Power Company received help from Gulf Coast companies to return power to 170 @,@ 000 customers before the assisting companies ' home areas were struck by the hurricane . Power was restored to most areas by September 4 , with an exception being St. George 's Island ; service was expected to be restored after several additional days . More broadly , owners of heavily damaged homes in the state faced new regulations on coastal construction in the state , which went into effect less than a month after the storm . The new rules entailed more rigorous study of factors such as a property 's prior history and surrounding buildings before approval to rebuild a demolished structure would be granted . Governor Graham preliminarily advised that houses more than halfway destroyed not be rebuilt . Recovery efforts after Hurricane Elena continued to a small degree for years after its passage ; for example , beach replenishment at Indian Rocks Beach in Pinellas County began in the summer of 1990 . 
 = = = Central Gulf Coast = = = 
 Power companies from several states sent workers to help restore service to the hardest @-@ hit areas of the Gulf Coast . Most of Alabama Power 's affected customers had power within 24 hours of the storm , though restoration of service to Dauphin Island took significantly longer . Power was fully restored to Central Louisiana Electric customers by September 4 . Alabama 's two coastal counties were declared federal disaster areas on September 7 . Special loan assistance was made available by the Small Business Administration and the Farmers Home Administration , the latter of which sought to help commercial growers who lost their crops to the storm . 
 Mississippi Governor William Allain sent 500 members of the National Guard to partner with 200 law enforcement officers along Mississippi 's coast in minimizing crime , and nighttime curfews were established in several cities . On September 4 , President Reagan declared Mississippi 's coastal counties a Major Disaster area . The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated that as many as 3 @,@ 000 homes in the state were uninhabitable , their occupants forced to find temporary living arrangements . The Small Business Administration approved special loans up to $ 500 @,@ 000 for owners of damaged businesses . Mississippi Power Company 's system was the hardest @-@ hit , and restoration of service was slow ; 50 @,@ 000 of 80 @,@ 000 customers were still without electricity by September 5 . 
 By September 5 , the Salvation Army , Red Cross , and other organizations had served 100 @,@ 000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi , and federal food stocks became available for the state to distribute to storm victims . Still , resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest @-@ hit locations , and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen . With dwindling supplies , the Salvation Army had to procure food from other parts of the region to serve to victims . In the days after the hurricane , an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted . 
 = Together Again ( Janet Jackson song ) = 
 " Together Again " is a song by American recording artist Janet Jackson from her sixth studio album , The Velvet Rope ( 1997 ) . It was written and produced by Jackson , Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , with additional writing by Jackson 's then @-@ husband , René Elizondo , Jr . It was released as the second single from the album on December 2 , 1997 , by Virgin . Originally written as a ballad , the track was rearranged as a dance and house song . Jackson was inspired to write the song by her own personal experience of losing a friend to AIDS , as well as by a piece of fan mail she received from a young boy in England who had lost his father . 
 " Together Again " was well received by music critics , who praised the song 's structure and Jackson 's vocals , comparing them to those of Diana Ross and works by Donna Summer . Commercially , the song was a success , topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks , as well as reaching the top of the Hot Dance Club Songs . The song was additionally certified Gold by the RIAA . Worldwide , it peaked within the top five in most countries , such as Canada and the United Kingdom , and topped the charts in the Netherlands . It is Jackson 's best selling single selling 6 million copies worldwide and is one of the best selling singles of all time . 
 Two music videos were produced for " Together Again " . The video for the original , directed by Seb Janiak , shows Jackson and her dancers performing in a futuristic African paradise where people are seen living side by side with wild animals such as elephants , giraffes , and wildcats . Another music video released for the ' Deeper Remix ' was directed by René Elizondo , Jr. and shows Jackson in an apartment . Jackson performed " Together Again " in a number of occasions to promote The Velvet Rope , including at the American Music Awards , and also on all of her tours since its release . It is also included in two of Jackson 's greatest hits collections , Number Ones ( 2009 ) and Icon : Number Ones ( 2010 ) .

 " Together Again " was written as a tribute from Jackson to a friend who had recently died from AIDS as well as AIDS victims and their families worldwide , as stated in the liner notes of The Velvet Rope ( 1997 ) . Originally written as a ballad , the track was re @-@ arranged as a dance and house song . Jackson was reportedly inspired to write the song from her own personal experience , as well as a piece of fan @-@ mail she received from a young boy in England who had lost his father . According to Jimmy Jam , " it had a deep meaning for her because it was about a friend she lost to AIDS , but as with all her songs , she tries to make them apply in a general sense to anybody . The idea was to make it a joyous song musically " . The arrangement of the song was constructed in 30 minutes by Jam , Lewis and Jackson while in the recording studio . Once the melody was in place , Jackson finished writing the lyrics to the song . The song 's sound was inspired by Donna Summer 's song " Last Dance " . Jackson told MTV News that her inspiration to write " Together Again " was " Runaway " by Nuyorican Soul , as the song reminded her of being in Studio 54 in New York when she was a child . " Runaway " gave Jackson a kind of New York feel of disco and she wanted to do something like this .

 " Together Again " was written and produced by Jackson , Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , with additional writing by Jackson 's then @-@ husband , René Elizondo , Jr . It is a dance and house track . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing , the song is set in common time with a key of C major . Jackson 's vocals range between A3 to D5 . The song has a moderate tempo of 123 beats per minute with the chord progression following the sequence of C – Em7 / B – Em7 ( b5 ) / Bb – A7 – Dm9 – G13 – Dm9 – G13 . The bass line in the chorus descends according to the key until reaching the <unk> , after which it goes back to the dominant note set up the resolution , the repetition of the chorus or the interlude , which begins on the <unk> . At the end of the second bridge , the song modulates up a minor third into E @-@ flat major . Three versions of the song were released ; the original dance version , the " Deep Remix " , a R & B and hip @-@ hop version , and the " Deeper Remix " , which is a R & B and soul remake . Lyrically , it was described as a ode from Jackson to a friend who had died from AIDS . Larry Flick from Billboard noted its " tear @-@ stained lyrics " . Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone described it as " unsullied pop bliss " , saying " The bass @-@ heavy house track " Together Again " showcases a poignant lead vocal , giving off a ' 60s soul / girl group vibe " ,

" " She even makes a bid for gay icon status " , wrote Neil McCormick in a review of The Velvet Rope for The Daily Telegraph , " delivering a diva @-@ ish performance reminiscent of Diana Ross on ' Together Again ' . " 
 " Together Again " was also compared to other singers ' works . Jon Pareles from The New York Times described " Together Again " as " a creamy Diana Ross homage " , noting that Jackson " deploys her small voice shrewdly " in it . Larry Flick from Billboard magazine called " Together Again " " a <unk> disco ode to loved ones lost to AIDS @-@ related illnesses " . Jackson " has clearly been studying Donna Summer records , delivering a wonderfully nuanced performance that takes firm command of the track 's vibrant house beat without sacrificing an ounce of emotion " . Danyel Smith , while interviewing Jackson for Vibe in November 1997 , elaborated that the song was a big , perfect ode to Donna Summer , and likened it to her songs " MacArthur Park " and " Last Dance " . In 1999 , ' Together Again " won the award for " Most Played Song " at the BMI Pop Awards .

 In order to promote The Velvet Rope and the single , Jackson performed " Together Again " at the American Music Awards of 1998 . The singer has also performed the song on all of her tours since its release . She included the song on the 1998 The Velvet Rope Tour . Dressed up in " chandeliers and sensible clothing " , it was performed as the closing song from the concert . Jon Pareles from The New York Times viewed the performance as " an elegy disguised as an arm @-@ waving , feel @-@ good song " . The performance of the song at the October 11 , 1998 show in New York City , at the Madison Square Garden , was broadcast during a special titled The Velvet Rope : Live in Madison Square Garden by HBO . It was also added to the setlist at its DVD release , The Velvet Rope Tour – Live in Concert in 1999 . It was again performed as the encore on the All for You Tour in support of her follow @-@ up album All for You in 2001 and 2002 . Gina <unk> from St. Petersburg Times , while reviewing the concert , described the performance , " The show closed with a buoyant Together Again that found Jackson grinning , surrounded by dancers moving in refreshing , unscripted merriment " . The February 16 , 2002 final date of the tour at the Aloha Stadium in Hawaii , was broadcast by HBO , and included a performance of " Together Again " .

 Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , Upsilon Andromedae c was detected by measuring variations in its star 's radial velocity as a result of the planet 's gravity . This was done by making precise measurements of the Doppler shift of the spectrum of Upsilon Andromedae A. At the time of discovery , Upsilon Andromedae A was already known to host one extrasolar planet , the hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b , however by 1999 it was clear that the inner planet could not explain the velocity curve . 
 In 1999 , astronomers at both San Francisco State University and the Harvard @-@ Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics independently concluded that a three @-@ planet model best fit the data . The two new planets were designated Upsilon Andromedae c and Upsilon Andromedae d . 
 = = Orbit and mass = = 
 Like the majority of long @-@ period extrasolar planets , the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c is eccentric , more so than any of the major planets in the Solar System ( including Pluto ) . If placed in the Solar System , Upsilon Andromedae c would lie between the orbits of Earth and Venus . 
 The high orbital eccentricity may be the result of gravitational perturbations from the planet Upsilon Andromedae d . Simulations suggest that the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c returns to its original circular state roughly once every 6 @,@ 700 years . 
 One proposal is that interactions between Upsilon Andromedae d and a ( now lost ) outer planet moved Upsilon Andromedae d into an orbit closer to the star , where it gradually caused the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c to become eccentric . If so , the rogue planet would have had to eject immediately ; it is unclear how likely this situation might be . Other models are possible . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae c is that the orbital inclination is unknown , and only a lower limit on the planet 's mass can be obtained . However , by combining radial velocity measurements from ground @-@ based telescopes with astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope , astronomers have determined the orbital inclination as well as the actual mass of Upsilon Andromedae c , which is about 13 @.@ 98 times the mass of Jupiter . The mutual inclination between c and d is 29 @.@ 9 degrees . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae c is a gas giant with no solid surface . Since the planet has only been detected indirectly through observations of its star , properties such as its radius , composition , and temperature are unknown . 
 Since its actual mass is approximately 14 times that of Jupiter , and its star 's metallicity is similar to that of the Sun , Upsilon Andromedae c may actually be a small brown dwarf .

 Coquitlam / <unk> / ( 2011 census population 126 @,@ 840 ) is a city in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia , Canada . Coquitlam , mainly a suburban city , is the sixth @-@ largest city in the province and is one of the 21 municipalities comprising Metro Vancouver . The current mayor of Coquitlam is Richard Stewart . 
 = = History = = 
 The Coast Salish people were the first to live in this area , and archaeology confirms continuous occupation of the territory for at least 9 @,@ 000 years . The name <unk> is said to be derived from a Coast Salish term meaning " red fish up the river " . 
 Explorer Simon Fraser came through the region in 1808 , and in the 1860s Europeans gradually started settling the area . Coquitlam began as a " place @-@ in @-@ between " with the construction of North Road in the mid @-@ 19th century to provide Royal Engineers in New Westminster access to the year @-@ round port facilities in Port Moody . 
 The young municipality got its first boost in 1889 when Frank Ross and James McLaren opened what would become Fraser Mills , a $ 350 @,@ 000 , then state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art lumber mill on the north bank of the Fraser River . The District of Coquitlam was incorporated in 1891 . By 1908 , a mill town of 20 houses , a store , post office , hospital , office block , barber shop , and pool hall had grown around the mill . A mill manager 's residence was built that would later become Place des Arts . 
 Over the next two years , several contingents of French Canadian mill workers arrived from Quebec , and Maillardville was born . Named for Father Edmond Maillard , a young Oblate from France , it became the largest Francophone centre west of Manitoba . Maillardville 's past is recognized today in street names , the Francophone education system and French immersion programs , French @-@ language guides and scouts , and celebrations such as Festival du Bois . 
 Following World War II , Coquitlam and the rest of the Lower Mainland experienced substantial population growth that continues today . The opening of Lougheed Highway in 1953 made the city more accessible and set the stage for residential growth . In 1971 , Coquitlam and Fraser Mills were amalgamated , which gave the city a larger industrial base . The mill closed in 2001 , and is now rezoned into a residential area . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Coquitlam is situated some 10 to 15 km ( 6 @.@ 2 to 9 @.@ 3 mi ) east of Vancouver , where the Coquitlam River connects with the Fraser River and extends northeast along the Pitt River toward the Coquitlam and Pitt lakes . Coquitlam borders Burnaby and Port Moody to the west , New Westminster to the southwest , and Port Coquitlam to the southeast . Burke Mountain , Eagle Ridge , and 1 @,@ 583 m ( 5 @,@ 194 ft ) tall Coquitlam Mountain form the northern boundary of the city . Coquitlam 's area , 152 @.@ 5 square kilometres ( 58 @.@ 9 sq mi ) , dwarfs the other communities in the Tri @-@ Cities ; it is about six times larger than either Port Moody or Port Coquitlam . 
 Like Vancouver , Coquitlam is in the Pacific Time Zone ( winter UTC − 8 , summer UTC − 7 ) , and the Pacific Maritime Ecozone . 
 = = = Neighbourhoods = = = 
 Coquitlam 's geographic shape can be thought of as a tilted hourglass , with two larger parcels of land with a smaller central section connecting them . 
 Southwest Coquitlam comprises the original core of the city , with Maillardville and Fraser River industrial sector giving way to the large residential areas of Austin Heights , colloquially referred to as " The Bump " due to its high and flat plateau topography . These older residences , with larger property dimensions , are increasingly being torn down and replaced with newer and larger homes . The Poirier Street area was the city 's original recreational centre with the Coquitlam Sports Centre , Chimo Aquatic and Fitness Centre , and sports fields located there , while City Hall was previously located further south in Maillardville . 
 The Austin Heights area contains Como Lake , a renowned urban fishing and recreation area , and headwaters for the Como watershed . The watershed represents one of the last urban watersheds in the Tri @-@ Cities that supports wild stocks of coho salmon as well as other species at risk such as coastal cutthroat trout ( both sea @-@ run and resident ) and bird species such as the great blue heron and green heron . It also contains Mundy Park , one of the largest urban parks in the Metro Vancouver area . 
 In 1984 , the provincial government sold 57 hectares ( 141 acres ) formerly attached to Riverview Hospital to Molnar Developments . Shortly afterward , this land was subdivided and became Riverview Heights , with about 250 single family homes . The remaining 240 acres ( 0 @.@ 97 km2 ) of this still @-@ active mental health facility has been the subject of much controversy between developers , environmentalists , and conservationists . In 2005 , the city 's task force on the hospital lands rejected the idea of further housing on the lands and declared that the lands and buildings should be protected and remain as a mental health facility . 
 Coquitlam Town Centre , was designated as a " Regional Town Centre " under the Metro Vancouver ’ s Livable Region Strategic Plan . The concept of a town centre for the area dates back to 1975 , and is intended to have a high concentration of high @-@ density housing , offices , cultural , entertainment and education facilities to serve major growth areas of the region , served by rapid transit service . It is in the town centre that many public buildings can be found , including City Hall , a branch of the Coquitlam Public Library , <unk> station , Coquitlam 's main fire hall , the David Lam Campus of Douglas College , the Evergreen Cultural Centre , City Centre Aquatic Complex , Town Centre Park and Percy Perry Stadium . Coquitlam Town Centre is currently undergoing an update of the Town Centre plan . 
 In 1989 , the provincial government sold 570 hectares ( 1 @,@ 409 acres ) of second @-@ growth forested land on the south slope of Eagle Mountain , known locally as Eagle Ridge , to developer <unk> . This resulted in the closure of Westwood Motorsport Park in 1990 , and the creation of Westwood Plateau , which was developed into 4 @,@ 525 upscale homes , as well as two golf courses . 
 With development on Westwood Plateau completed and the opening of the David Avenue Connector in 2006 , Coquitlam 's primary urban development has now shifted to Burke Mountain in the northeastern portion of the city .

 Like the rest of Metro Vancouver , Coquitlam has a maritime temperate climate , enjoying mild temperatures and sufficient precipitation ; warm drier summers and wet mild winters . However , unlike other cities in the area , precipitation is especially heavy in Coquitlam due to its proximity to the mountain slopes . With westward air moving off the Pacific Ocean , the air is forced to flow up the Coast Mountains causing it to cool and condense and fall as precipitation , this process is known as orographic precipitation . The orographic effect is mainly responsible for the massive 1 @,@ 955 mm ( 77 @.@ 0 in ) . ) annual average precipitation that Coquitlam receives each year , with most falling as rainfall in the fall and winter months , with 287 mm ( 11 @.@ 3 in ) . ) in November ; the summer is usually sunny with minimal precipitation with 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) . ) in August . Although the mild temperatures allow for mostly rain to fall during the winter months , occasionally snow will fall . With a slightly higher elevation compared to the rest of Metro Vancouver , Coquitlam can receive an average of 58 cm ( 23 in ) . ) of snow each year , with it rarely staying on the ground for more than a day or two , adding to a very intermittent snow cover during the winter season . On 29 December 1996 over 45 cm of snow fell in just 24 hours . 
 One of the most recent snowy winters was 2008 – 09 , when in the last two weeks of December cold temperatures from an arctic front that had just seeped its way into the lower mainland and the Fraser Valley collided with moist air from the pacific ; almost 100 centimetres ( 39 in ) of snow fell in Coquitlam , resulting in an extreme snow cover ( over 50 cm ) for Christmas and resulted major traffic and flight issues . In the first week of January 2009 , sudden warmer temperatures starting with heavy wet snow and later transitioning into heavy rain from a pineapple express resulted in some flooding in low @-@ lying areas near the Fraser river . As Coquitlam has a slightly higher elevation than most communities in Metro Vancouver most of the precipitation that fell in the first week of January 2009 was heavy wet snow that transitioned into rain much later , resulting in an even deeper snow pack notably for residents on Westwood Plateau where the elevation is anywhere from 100 to 400 m above sea level . After the winter of 2008 – 09 ended , over 175 cm of snow had fallen . 
 Coquitlam is also located in the warmest region in Canada where average mean annual temperature is 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) . Temperatures are warm during the summer months with an average high of 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) , and an average low of 13 ° C ( 55 ° F ) in August . During the winter months , the average high is 6 ° C ( 43 ° F ) , and the average low is 1 ° C ( 34 ° F ) in January . This relatively mild climate , by Canadian standards , is caused by the warm Alaska current offshore and the many mountain ranges preventing the cold arctic air from the rest of Canada from reaching the southwest corner of British Columbia ; however , occasionally it can fall well below freezing ( below − 5 ° C / − 10 ° C ) for a day or two during the winter .

 = Walter Alston = 
 Walter Emmons Alston ( December 1 , 1911 – October 1 , 1984 ) , nicknamed " Smokey " , was an American baseball player and manager in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . He is best known for managing the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers between 1954 and 1976 . Alston signed 23 one @-@ year contracts with the Dodgers . He had a calm , reticent demeanor , for which he was sometimes also known as " The Quiet Man " . 
 Alston grew up in rural Ohio and lettered in baseball and basketball at Miami University in Ohio . Though his MLB playing career consisted of one game and one at @-@ bat with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1936 , he played and managed for several seasons in minor league baseball . His service included a stint as manager of the Nashua Dodgers , the first integrated professional team in modern baseball . He was promoted to manage the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954 after several successful seasons in Brooklyn 's Class AAA minor league teams . 
 As a major league manager , Alston led Dodgers teams to seven National League ( NL ) pennants and four world championships . His 1955 team was the only World Series championship team while the club was in Brooklyn ; they clinched the NL pennant earlier in the calendar year than any previous pennant winner in league history . Alston retired with more than 2 @,@ 000 career wins and managed NL All @-@ Star teams to seven victories . He was selected as Manager of the Year six times . 
 Alston was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983 . He suffered a heart attack that year , was hospitalized for a month and was unable to attend his Hall of Fame induction ceremony . He never fully recovered and he died at a hospital in Oxford , Ohio on October 1 , 1984 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Alston was born in Venice , Ohio . He spent much of his childhood on a farm in Morning Sun , Ohio . When Alston was a teenager , the family moved to Darrtown , Ohio . He attended Milford Township High School in Darrtown . He received the nickname " Smokey " as a high school pitcher , owing to the speed of his fastball . He graduated from high school in 1929 and married longtime girlfriend Lela Vaughn Alexander the next year . 
 In 1935 , Alston graduated with a degree in industrial arts and physical education from Miami University in Oxford , Ohio . He said that finances were a challenge in college and that he had paid his way through school by playing pool . He lettered three years in both basketball and baseball . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 Alston played minor league baseball as an infielder for the Greenwood Chiefs and Huntington Red Birds in 1935 and 1936 , respectively . For the 1936 Huntington team , he hit 35 home runs in 120 games . Alston 's only major league game was with the St. Louis Cardinals on September 27 , 1936 , substituting for Johnny Mize at first base . He later described his major league playing career to a reporter by saying , " Well , I came up to bat for the Cards back in ' 36 , and Lon Warneke struck me out . That 's it " . He also committed one error in two fielding chances at first base . 
 Alston returned to the minor leagues after his brief MLB appearance . He split the 1937 season between the Houston Buffaloes and Rochester Red Wings , hitting for a combined .229 batting average . Alston played for the Portsmouth Red Birds in 1938 , finishing the season with a .311 average and 28 home runs as Portsmouth won its only Middle Atlantic League championship . He returned to Portsmouth in 1940 , hit 28 home runs and was a player @-@ manager for part of the season . He was a player @-@ manager for the next two seasons with the Springfield Cardinals and even appeared in seven games as a pitcher in 1942 . He returned to Rochester as a first baseman and third baseman in 1943 . He moved to the Trenton Packers , where he was a player @-@ manager in 1944 and 1945 . Alston had been offered the job in Trenton , a minor league farm club of the Brooklyn Dodgers , by Branch Rickey , the executive who had signed him as a player with St. Louis . 
 After his two seasons with Trenton , Alston served as a player @-@ manager for the first integrated U.S. baseball team based in the twentieth century , the Nashua Dodgers of the Class @-@ B New England League . Alston managed black Dodgers prospects Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella , leading Nashua to a New England League title in 1946 . Alston later said that he did not give much consideration to racial issues and that he had simply thought about how much they would benefit the team . Alston led the Pueblo Dodgers to the Western League title the next season . He appeared as a player in two games , which were his final professional playing appearances . For his 13 @-@ season minor league playing career , Alston hit .295 with 176 home runs . However , he hit only .239 in 535 at bats in Class AA , which was the highest minor league classification through 1945 .

 In 1948 , Alston managed the St. Paul Saints , a Dodgers Class AAA affiliate , to an 86 @-@ 68 win @-@ loss record . The team finished in third place , 14 games behind an Indianapolis Indians team managed by Al López . That year , Alston managed Campanella again , where Campanella integrated the American Association . The media was critical of Alston for playing Campanella ; they said that the catcher was simply there to integrate the league . Campanella hit 13 home runs in 35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers . The 1949 Saints finished with a 93 @-@ 60 record and four of its players collected more than 90 runs batted in ( RBI ) . The team finished in first place , half a game in front of Indianapolis . During the baseball off @-@ season , Alston worked as a teacher in Darrtown . 
 From 1950 to 1953 , Alston managed another Dodgers AAA affiliate , the Montreal Royals of the International League . The team won between 86 and 95 games during each season of Alston 's tenure . The 1951 and 1952 Montreal Royals won International League pennants . In 1951 and 1953 , Montreal won the Governors ' Cup playoff tournament . Alston was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame many years later .

 Alston was named manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers for the 1954 season . His predecessor , Charlie Dressen , had moved on from the Dodgers after the team 's leadership refused to sign him to a two @-@ year or three @-@ year contract . Dressen had won two pennants in three years and nearly won a third . Dodgers executive Buzzie Bavasi fought for Alston to be hired in Brooklyn . Bringing Alston to Brooklyn has been described as Bavasi 's biggest contribution to the team 's history . Alston was an unknown at the major league level and the New York Daily News reported his hiring with the headline " Walter Who ? " 
 Becoming immediately known for his quiet nature , Alston was sometimes referred to as " The Quiet Man " . Alston 's personality contrasted with that of Dressen , who was much more outspoken . Sportswriters had difficulty writing about Alston at first because he did not say much . He also seemed more conservative in his decisions on the field , which drew criticism from his players even though he had managed many of them in the minor leagues . Don Zimmer said that he had learned more from Dressen and that Dressen knew more about baseball than Alston . Jackie Robinson did not like Alston at first either , according to Robinson 's wife . 
 Alston commented on his approach , saying , " I never criticized a player for a mistake on the spot . Whenever I got steamed up about something , I always wanted to sleep on it and face the situation with a clear head . " Sportswriter Jim Murray said that Alston was " the only guy in the game who could look Billy Graham right in the face without blushing and who would order corn on the cob in a Paris restaurant . " The 1954 Dodgers finished second in the NL as both Gil Hodges and Duke Snider hit at least 40 home runs and registered 130 runs batted in . 
 The 1955 Dodgers got off to a strong start . Even so , an Associated Press article noted that Alston was reticent in response to questions and that he did not seem like a manager who had won ten consecutive games . The 1955 Brooklyn team won the pennant and its only World Series championship . They clinched the NL pennant earlier in the year than any team had in NL history . In the World Series , Alston started Johnny Podres , who had a mediocre 9 @-@ 10 regular season record , in the third and seventh games ; Podres won both games . The pitcher had struggled with arm problems for much of the season . 
 Sandy Koufax emerged as a pitcher for the Dodgers during that championship season . Alston was criticized by Jackie Robinson and others over his sparse use of Koufax in his early career . During Koufax 's second MLB start , he pitched a shutout , giving up two hits and striking out 14 batters . However , that success did not prompt a lot of opportunities for Koufax . The pitcher appeared in only 12 games that season , mostly in relief . 
 The 1956 team repeated as NL champions ; the team was bolstered by the play of Duke Snider , who hit a league @-@ leading 43 home runs and also led the league in walks . They fell to third place ( 84 @-@ 70 ) in 1957 . 
 = = = = Early years in Los Angeles = = = = 
 The team finished in seventh place ( 71 @-@ 83 ) in 1958 , the club 's first season after moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles . Criticism of Alston had begun to mount during that season , but he led the Dodgers to a world championship in 1959 . Six players on the 1959 team finished with double @-@ digit totals in home runs , while 22 @-@ year @-@ old Don Drysdale led the team 's pitchers with 17 wins . Several Los Angeles players , including Wally Moon , characterized Alston as indecisive in the late 1950s and 1960s . However , Moon later came to describe Alston as a good manager who had gotten " good mileage " out of his players . 
 Managing the NL All @-@ Star Team in 1960 , Alston attracted some controversy when he left Milwaukee Braves pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette off the All @-@ Star roster . An Associated Press report said the omission may have been a snub directed at Dressen , who was by then managing in Milwaukee . The 1960 Dodgers finished in fourth place . The following year , the team finished in second place after veteran Duke Snider missed two months with a broken arm . The Dodgers lost the lead in the 1962 NL pennant race and rumors surfaced that Alston and coach Leo Durocher might be fired , but the team retained both men for 1963 . 
 The Dodgers won the 1963 World Series . This series represented the first time that the New York Yankees had lost a World Series in four games . Alston 's pitchers excelled , as Koufax struck out 23 batters over two games and Drysdale threw a shutout in Game 3 . Over the four games , Alston employed only three starting pitchers and one relief pitcher in the series . In 1964 , the team finished 80 @-@ 82 in its first losing season in several years . Alston used the team 's 1964 performance to motivate them moving forward . In spring training before the 1965 season , he said that he would not let his team forget the difficulties they had in the previous season . 
 The Dodgers returned to the 1965 World Series . Alston could not start his number one pitcher , Koufax , in the opening game of that series because Koufax was observing Yom Kippur . Instead , Alston turned to Drysdale , who struggled , lasting 2 2 ⁄ 3 innings and surrendering seven runs . When Alston came to the mound to remove him , Drysdale said to his manager , " I bet right now you wish I was Jewish , too . " The team recovered from losing that first game and they won the World Series in seven games . Koufax appeared in three games during the series , registering two shutouts . 
 Alston 's Dodgers teams of the 1960s benefited from the strong pitching by Drysdale and Koufax . In 1966 , both players held out of spring training and demanded three @-@ year contracts each worth $ 500 @,@ 000 , which was more money than anyone was making in baseball at the time . The players were eventually signed for lesser amounts . Drysdale struggled that year , but Koufax won 27 games . The Dodgers went to the 1966 World Series but were defeated in four games . Koufax retired after the season on the advice of doctors who examined his sore arm . Drysdale retired three years later . Both men had pitched their entire major league careers for Alston . 
 = = = = Final years as manager = = = = 
 Alston guided his teams to at least 85 wins per season between 1969 and 1976 . They finished in second place in their division six times during that span . The team came very close to a pennant in 1971 ; after falling 11 games out of first place , the team performed well late in the season and finished one game behind the San Francisco Giants . Beginning in 1973 , Alston 's team featured an infield of Steve Garvey , Davey Lopes , Bill Russell and Ron Cey . The group played together for eight years , remaining together long after the end of Alston 's tenure . 
 In 1974 , the Dodgers won the NL pennant and went to the World Series to face the Oakland Athletics . Alston used closer Mike Marshall in a record @-@ setting 106 games that season and Marshall won the Cy Young Award . Alston received some media attention when he considered using Marshall as a starter . Marshall ended up appearing in all five games of the series and gave up one run in nine innings , but he did not start a game . The Dodgers lost the series four games to one . The 1975 and 1976 Dodgers won 88 and 92 games respectively , but they finished well out of first place in both seasons . 
 In September 1976 , Alston announced that he would retire at the end of the season . At a press conference , Alston said , " I 've been in baseball for 41 years and it 's been awfully good to me . This has been a pretty big day . I had three birdies playing golf for the first time in my life and now I 'm announcing that I 'm stepping down as manager . I told Peter this afternoon to give somebody else a chance to manage the club . " Alston retired with 2 @,@ 063 wins ( 2 @,@ 040 in the regular season and 23 in the postseason ) . Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times . He also managed NL All @-@ Star squads a record nine times and won seven of those games . At a time when multi @-@ year contracts were on the rise , Alston 's managerial career consisted of 23 one @-@ year contracts . He earned seven NL pennants in that span . 
 Sportswriter Leonard <unk> described Alston 's role with the Dodgers , pointing out that O 'Malley was always seen as " the boss " while Alston stuck to the on @-@ field management of the team . <unk> said that Alston 's loyalty and subdued nature contributed to the stability that the team enjoyed . O 'Malley once commented that Alston was " non @-@ irritating . Do you realize how important it is to have a manager who doesn 't irritate you ? " 
 = = Later life and legacy = = 
 The Dodgers retired Alston 's number the year after he stepped down as manager ; he was only the fourth Dodger to receive that honor . He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1983 . Alston suffered a heart attack that year and was hospitalized for a month . Alston 's grandson traveled to Cooperstown to represent the ill former manager at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony . Alston died in an Oxford hospital from complications from the recent heart attack on October 1 , 1984 . He was 72 . A funeral home spokesman said that Alston had remained ill since the heart attack . He is interred at Darrtown Cemetery in Darrtown , Ohio . 
 Upon Alston 's death , MLB commissioner Peter Ueberroth referred to him as one of baseball 's greatest managers . Former Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional run @-@ ins with Alston , but he said that Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of each team that he managed . Tommy Lasorda , who played and coached under Alston and ultimately succeeded him as manager , commented on how easy it was to play for Alston . Broadcaster Vin Scully said , " I always imagined him to be the type who could ride shotgun on a stage through Indian territory . He was all man and two yards tall . He was very quiet , very controlled . He never made excuses . He gave the players the credit and he took the blame . He was so solid , so American . " 
 Ohio State Route 177 was named the Walter " Smokey " Alston Memorial Highway in 1999 . He was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame in 2010 . In April 2013 , readers of the Los Angeles Times named Alston number 16 on a list of the 20 greatest Dodgers of all time . A memorial to Alston is located at Milford Township Community Park in Darrtown . 
 = Tafl games = 
 Tafl games are a family of ancient Germanic and Celtic strategy board games played on a checkered or latticed gameboard with two armies of uneven numbers , representing variants of an early Scandinavian board game called tafl or hnefatafl in contemporary literature . 
 Although the size of the board and the number of pieces varied , all games involved a distinctive 2 : 1 ratio of pieces , with the lesser side having a king @-@ piece that started in the centre . No complete , unambiguous description of the rules of a tafl game exists , but the king 's objective was to escape to ( variously ) the board 's periphery or corners , while the greater force 's objective was to capture him . The attacking force has the natural advantage at the start of each game , likely indicating an important cultural aspect by mimicking the success of Viking raids . Another cultural indication of the king is that importance of the Viking chiefs ' presence in battle . Although the kings of Europe later claimed divine rule and sat upon the throne rather than bodies in the battlefield , it was essential for a Viking chief to be considered an equal in war . The importance of war is also reflected in Hnefatafl because it is a war strategy game , which can indicate an important reason why the gaming boards have been found with males of all ages . In <unk> , a male skeleton between the ages of 8 and 13 was found with weapons and a Hnefatafl board game . Vikings tended to take boys onto the battlefield with them , which explains why young boys also played these war @-@ strategic board games . 
 There is also some controversy over whether some tafl games ( i.e. Hnefatafl and Tawlbwrdd ) may have employed dice . Tafl spread everywhere the Vikings traveled , including Iceland , Britain , Ireland , and Lapland . Versions of Tafl , comprising Hnefatafl , Alea Evangelii , Tawlbwrdd ( Wales ) , <unk> , Ard Rí and Tablut , were played across much of Northern Europe from earlier than 400 B.C. until it was supplanted by chess in the 12th century . 
 The term tafl ( Old Norse : " table " , " board " ; pronounced [ <unk> ] ) is the original name of the game . However , Hnefatafl became the preferred term for the game in Scandinavia by the end of the Viking Age , to distinguish it from other board games , such as <unk> ( chess ) , <unk> ( Tables ) and <unk> ( Fox games ) , as these became known . The specific name Hnefatafl possibly arose as meaning " board game of the fist " , from hnefi ( " fist " ) + tafl , where " fist " referred to the central king @-@ piece . The precise etymology is disputed , but hnefi certainly referred to the king @-@ piece , and several sources refer to Hnefatafl as " King 's table " . In Anglo @-@ Saxon England , the term <unk> also referred to many board games . It is not known if the Anglo @-@ Saxons had a specific name for the game or if they generically referred to it as " <unk> " in the way that modern people might refer to " cards " . 
 Several games may be confused with tafl games , due to the inclusion of the word " tafl " in their names or other similarities . <unk> is the Old Norse name for Fox and Geese , a game dating from at least the 14th century . It is still known and played in Europe . <unk> is the Old Norse name for Tables ( the medieval forerunner of <unk> ) . <unk> is the Old Norse name for Chess . <unk> or <unk> ( Modern Irish : <unk> ) was played in Ireland . The Welsh equivalent was <unk> and the Breton equivalent <unk> ; all terms mean " wood @-@ sense " . This popular medieval game was played with equal forces on each side and thus was not a tafl variant , but rather may have been the medieval descendant of the Roman game <unk> or Ludus <unk> . 
 = = Hnefatafl in Saga literature = = 
 Hnefatafl was mentioned in several of the medieval sagas , including Orkneyinga saga , Friðþjófs saga , Hervarar saga , and others . These three period treatments of Hnefatafl offer some important clues about the game , while numerous other incidental references to Hnefatafl or Tafl exist in saga literature . Sagas help indicate the widespread use of board games just by mentioning them — although rituals varied in the Viking period from region to region , there were some underlying basics to culture . The fact that the sagas mention board games indicates this use because the sagas are read and understood by a very large audience . In <unk> saga , the notability of Hnefatafl is evident in the nine boasts of Jarl Rögnvald Kali Kolsson , who tops his list with skill at Tafl . In Friðþjófs saga , a conversation over a game of Hnefatafl reveals that the king 's men are red and the attackers white , and that the word hnefi does indeed refer to the <unk> . The most revealing – and yet most ambiguous – clues to Hnefatafl lie in a series of riddles posed by a character identified as Odin in disguise ( see Gestumblindi ) in Hervarar saga . One riddle , as stated in Hauksbók , refers to " the weaponless maids who fight around their lord , the [ brown / red ] ever sheltering and the [ fair / white ] ever attacking him , " although there is controversy over whether the word weaponless refers to the maids or , as in other versions , to the king himself , which may support the argument that a " weaponless king " cannot take part in captures ( see # Balance of play ) . One may also note that the assignment of the colours of brown or red to the defenders and fair or white to the attackers is consistent with Friðþjófs saga . Another of Gestumblindi 's riddles asks , " What is that beast all girded with iron , which kills the flocks ? He has eight horns but no head , and runs as he pleases . " Here , it is the answer that is controversial , as the response has been variously translated as : " It is the húnn in hnefatafl . He has the name of a bear and runs when he is thrown ; " or , " It is the húnn in hnefatafl . He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked . " The first problem is in translating the word húnn , which may refer to a die ( as suggested by the former translation ) , the " eight horns " referring to the eight corners of a six @-@ sided die and " the flocks " that he kills referring to the stakes the players lose . Alternatively , húnn may refer to the king , his " eight horns " referring to the eight defenders , which is more consistent with the latter translation , " He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked . " Ultimately , the literary references prove inconclusive on the use of dice in Hnefatafl .

 <unk> ( Irish : bran dubh ) was the Irish form of tafl . We know from two poems that it was played with five men against eight , and that one of the five was a " <unk> " , or chief . A number of 7 × 7 boards have been found , the most famous being the elaborate wooden board found at Ballinderry in 1932 , featuring holes for pegged pieces , possibly to allow for portability of the game . The name <unk> means " black raven " .

 This variant from <unk> , is the best documented version . Carl Linnaeus recorded the rules and a drawing of the board in his journal during his 1732 expedition to Lapland . His description , in Latin , was incomplete , as he did not speak the Sami language of his hosts and described the game only from observing the players . The game was played on a 9 × 9 mat of embroidered reindeer hide . In his diary , Lachesis Lapponica , Linnaeus referred to the light ( defending ) pieces as " Swedes " and the dark ( attacking ) pieces as " Muscovites " . What may have been the same game was still being played in the late 19th century , as described in P.A. Lindholm 's Hos <unk> ( 1884 ) .

Robert ap Ifan documented it with a drawing in a manuscript dated 1587 . His version was played on an 11 × 11 board with 12 pieces on the king 's side and 24 on the opponent 's side . His passage states : 
 The above <unk> should be played with a king in the centre and twelve men in the places next to him , and twenty @-@ four men seek to capture him . These are placed , six in the centre of each side of the board and in the six central positions . And two move the men in the game , and if one [ piece ] belonging to the king comes between the attackers , he is dead and is thrown out of the game , and the same if one of the attackers comes between two of the king ’ s men in the same manner . And if the king himself comes between two of the attackers , and if you say ‘ Watch your king ’ before he moves to that space , and he is unable to escape , you capture him . If the other says ‘ I am your <unk> ’ and goes between two , there is no harm . If the king can go along the [ illegible ] line , that side wins the game .

 Hnefatafl was a popular game in medieval Scandinavia and was mentioned in several of the Norse Sagas . Some of these saga references have contributed to controversy over the possible use of dice in playing hnefatafl . The rules of the game were never explicitly recorded , and only playing pieces and fragmentary boards are extant , so it is not known for sure how the game was played . If dice were in fact used , nothing has been recorded about how they were employed . Archaeological and literary sources indicate Hnefatafl may have been played on a 13 × 13 or an 11 × 11 board . It became a popular game in Northern Europe during the Viking era ( end of the 8th century to 1000 <unk> ) , a turbulent time full of conflicts . When chess became a popular game during the Middle Ages , the rules of Hnefatafl were forgotten over time . Hnefatafl was particularly popular in Nordic countries and followed the Viking civilization to other parts of Europe , primarily to the British Isles and the Viking country of " <unk> . " The game developed differently at different locations . Archaeologists have found editions in places such as Ireland and Ukraine . Hnefatafl literally translates to " fist table , " from the Old Icelandic ( equivalently in modern Icelandic ) <unk> , ' fist ' , and tafl , ' table ' . The study of medieval manuscripts and examination of pieces and boards has allowed researchers to figure out how the game was probably played . It was last recorded to have been played in Wales during 1587 and Lapland in 1723 .

 Alea evangelii , which means " game of the gospels " , was described , with a drawing , in the 12th @-@ century Corpus Christi College , Oxford manuscript 122 , from Anglo @-@ Saxon England . It was played on the intersections of a board of 18 × 18 cells . The manuscript describes the layout of the board as a religious allegory , but it is clear that this was a game based on Hnefatafl . 
 = = Reconstruction = = 
 No complete , unambiguous description of the rules of a tafl game exists . The best description we have from history is that given by Linnaeus of the game Tablut in the 1732 diary of his travels , Lachesis Lapponica . The following rules are based on the 1811 translation of Lachesis Lapponica into English by James Edward Smith . 
 The game is played on a 9 × 9 board . Initial setup is as shown in the diagram . 
 The king starts on the central square or castle , called the konakis , which no other piece may ever occupy . 
 The eight defenders , called Swedes , start on the eight squares adjoining the konakis , in the form of a cross . 
 The sixteen attackers , called Muscovites , start in groups of four at the centre of each edge of the board . ( In Linnaeus ' notes , these squares were embroidered to signify them as the domain of the Muscovites . ) 
 All remaining squares ( neutral zone ) may be occupied by any piece during the game . 
 Any piece may move any number of vacant spaces in any straight line [ ← ↑ → ↓ ] , but not diagonally . ( Compare to the rook in Chess . ) 
 No piece may ever pass over another piece in its path . 
 If the king should ever have an unimpeded path ( through the neutral zone ) to the edge of the board , unless he is immediately blocked by a Muscovite , he may escape and the game is over . ( This rule suggests that the king may not escape through the domain of the Muscovites . ) 
 If the king should ever have a path of escape , he must call out " <unk> " ; if two paths of escape , then his escape is imminent and he must call out " <unk> " . ( Compare these to " check " and " checkmate " in Chess . ) 
 Any piece , save for the king , may be captured and removed from the board if it becomes surrounded on two opposite sides by enemies . ( This is known as custodial capture . ) 
 If the king is surrounded on all four sides by enemies , he is taken prisoner . If he is surrounded on three sides , he may escape by the fourth . 
 If the king is on a square adjoining the konakis and is surrounded on three sides by his enemies and the fourth by the konakis , he is captured . ( This rule suggests that once the king has left the konakis , he can never return . ) 
 If the king is captured , the Swedes are conquered and the Muscovites victorious . 
 Several problems of gameplay are left woefully ambiguous or completely untouched in Linnaeus ' notes , and some translations are problematic . There are also several other variations played by modern <unk> . 
 = = Balance of play = = 
 There is some controversy concerning the widely reported imbalance of the game , as the rules strongly favor the king , although there are several rule modifications that can produce more balanced play , such as a weaponless king ( the king cannot participate in captures ) , escape to the corners ( rather than to the edges ) , or hostile attacker camps ( the king and defenders may be captured against a vacant attacker camp square ) . <unk> ( 1992 ) even reveals some workarounds to produce more balanced play without modifying the rules of gameplay . 
 One such solution is by bidding : Players take turns bidding on how many moves it will take them to win the game . The lowest bidder gets the king . Thus , one player may open with a bid of 15 turns , the other player may counter with a bid of 14 turns , and the first player , more confident in his ability to escape in 13 rounds than in his ability to contain for 14 , may bid 13 and take the king 's side . If that player does not escape within 13 turns , the other player wins . Another workaround is to play a two @-@ round match , in which players switch sides after the first round . If the king escapes both rounds , the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns . 
 The description of <unk> by Robert ap Ifan ( preceding Linnaeus ' account by 145 years ) states that the king could be captured by two men . Peterson suggests that Linnaeus ' special capture of the king is incorrect , and states that statistics from modern games played with four @-@ man capture of the king show that white wins more often than black . However , it has not yet been demonstrated that balanced play results from rules allowing for a two @-@ man capture of the king . Interestingly , some sources indicate that Scandinavian museum reconstructions of Hnefatafl typically stipulate that the king may be captured by only two attackers unless he is still in his hall , in which case he must be surrounded on all four sides . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Around 1960 , Milton Bradley published Swords and Shields , which was essentially Tablut as recorded by Linnaeus , but with the Swedes transformed into shields ( with a king shield ) and the Muscovites transformed into swords . Tafl seems also to have been the basis for two other modern board games that each bear significant resemblance to the historical games , but with some important differences . Both games feature similar symmetry but diverge from the classic 2 : 1 attacker / defender ratio , and both have important differences in their tactics . Breakthru was developed in the 1960s as part of the 3M bookshelf game series . It features tafl @-@ like symmetry , but with twelve defenders plus one " flagship " ( cf. king ) pitted against twenty attackers upon a tiered board , so that the objective of the defenders is to escort the flagship from the centre to the outer zone of the board . Apart from the distinction of the inner zone and outer zone , there are no distinctive spaces on the Breakthru board . Breakthru also features a distinctive double move , whereas no evidence points to such a move in any of the historical games . Thud , a modern game inspired by a series of fantasy novels by Terry Pratchett ( which in turn were inspired by the historical tafl games ) , also features the general symmetry of tafl games , although it is played on an octagonal board with only eight defenders pitted against thirty @-@ two attackers . Thud also features a " <unk> " ( cf. konakis ) , but no <unk> . There are also important differences in the moves and attacks in Thud . 
 In 2008 , Hnefatafl was revived by Peter Kelly in the island of Fetlar in Shetland , where the annual World Quickplay Hnefatafl Championships are now held each summer under the auspices of the Fetlar Hnefatafl Panel . The 2008 Champion was Wendy Sutherland from Yorkshire , while the 2009 and 2010 Championships were won by Tim Millar from Somerset . The term " <unk> " refers to the time limit of ten seconds per move , marked by the sounding of a gong . Hnefatafl can be played online on sites similar to <unk> Aage Nielsen created his site in 1998 , and currently hosts the World Tafl Federation Hnefatafl Championship Tournament . A modern Hnefatafl game site was launched in 2014 , by Jacob Teal and John Carlyle . 
 = Ved Vejen = 
 Ved Vejen ( meaning By the Wayside or At the Roadside ) is a short novel written by the Danish author Herman Bang in 1886 . It was originally published in Copenhagen by Det <unk> Forlag as part of a collection of four stories entitled Stille Eksistenser ( Quiet <unk> ) , centering on women who are subdued or living in isolation . It was first published independently in 1898 . An impressionist novel , it relates the story of Katinka , a sensitive but ambitious young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master , Bai . 
 At the time of release in Denmark in 1886 , critics from the daily newspapers were generally enthusiastic about Ved Vejen . It is now considered an important contribution to Danish literature , listed in the Danish Culture Canon . In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka , directed by Max von Sydow . 
 = = Background = = 
 Herman Bang 's novel was inspired by an incident in 1883 when he was passing through <unk> Station in the north of Jutland . He noticed a young woman at the window who , her pale face couched in her hands , stared after his departing train . In the introduction to Stille Eksistenser he explains : " For the rest of the journey , I could see the woman 's face between the flowers . Her look was not quite one of longing — longing would have perhaps fluttered to death by breaking its wings in such tight confines — just a quite resignation , a waning sorrow . And when the train had slid by , she would be peering out with the same look over <unk> Lyng — over the dreary plain . " 
 Bang started writing the novel in 1885 in Vienna , after remembering <unk> Station : " It was in one of those windows behind the flowers that I saw her face , a face which I had not been able to erase from my memory for two years and which , as if a painter , I felt like drawing in soft , melancholic , almost blurry lines and using it as a kind of cover illustration for this book . "

 The novel centres on the character of Katinka Bai , a quiet , sensitive young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master , Bai . The marriage is barren , and she remains isolated . Almost subconsciously , she passionately longs after something undefinable . Even after the arrival of Huus , a neighbour with whom she begins to establish a promising relationship , she is unable to fulfill her passion , although for the first time in her life she falls in love . In the small provincial community where they live , neither she nor Huus dares to break the conventions they know , sad as it all may be . When they realize they cannot take their attachment any further , they decide to separate and Huus leaves the country . At the end of the novel , as at the beginning , Katinka stands by the wayside , observing life glide by . 
 = = Themes = = 
 In Ved Vejen , Bang has masterfully developed his impressionistic style . While recognizing that impressionism was first and foremost a trend in painting , he explained in a letter sent to Peter Nansen from Prague that he was trying to achieve the same style in literature : " Impressionistic is indeed the word . I am frantically striving to make every single impression clear and precise and distinctive , and so I never think about the whole " Jean @-@ Claude <unk> adds that while he owes much to Zola , Daudet and Maupassant , he channels naturalism into a quite unexpected direction , that of impressionism . His characters are revealed through their responses or a slight turn of phrase along the lines of the Norwegian Jonas Lie or the Russian Turgenev . He does not explain , he merely presents a picture , providing the reader with impressions , allowing him to read between the lines , interpreting what lies behind the words . On meeting Claude Monet , he was told , " You are the first impressionist writer . " A recognized example of his mastery of impressionism is the novel 's opening scene where all the characters meet at the station . 
 Longtime Scandinavian Studies scholar Niels <unk> states that the novel " engagingly , ironically , sadly captures the quite trivial life of a rural , provincial community " and illustrates an unconsummated love relationship between two ordinary people . He highlights the " amazingly suggestive impressionism " of the novel which permits the reader to become more intimate with the characters , especially the scene at the vicar 's party which provides a vivid image of the personalities of the people attending it , with their individual voices coming together to form a complete picture . Although Katinka Bai , a timid individual , is not a heroine in comparison with today 's depiction of a strong independent woman , the reader is naturally drawn to empathize with her situation and with her as a character . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 The novel , like Bang 's other works such as <unk> ( 1887 ) , Tine ( 1889 ) , and <unk> ( 1896 ) , is still widely read in Denmark , confirming the author as one of Denmark 's leading novelists . At the time of release in Denmark in 1886 , the daily newspapers were generally enthusiastic about Ved Vejen . Writing in Politiken , Edvard Brandes , after referring to the novel 's " outrageous style " , welcomed it as a " quite excellent novel " which was " so specially Danish " . He concluded by calling for it to be widely read as " the best new literature we have seen this autumn " . In Social @-@ Demokraten , C.E. Jensen found that Bang " depicts the infinitely simple existence and everything it covers with the finest and most sensitive art ... His style gives the reader an impression of reality 's monotony , allowing him to imagine the emotions hidden behind it . " Vilhelm Møller of <unk> i <unk> og Text praised Ved Vejen as the best of the four stories in Stille Eksistenser , " containing all Bang 's qualities in good measure and very few of the weaknesses which have disrupted his earlier work . It can certainly be favourably compared with all the novels of the past year . " Only Berlingske Tidende 's ( unnamed ) critic was dismissive , commenting : " The story Ved Vejen is weak in content and often unreadable in form ... We recommend the author to be less nervous , less jumpy and less impressionistic . " 
 In selecting Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon , the selection committee operating under the Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction of the novel is that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed . With bittersweet irony , the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others . With its almost cinematic sequences , the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people 's minds , especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society . It is not just Bang 's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today 's readership . In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka , directed by Max von Sydow , starring Tammi <unk> as Katinka .

Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies , and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature . They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion . 
 Development began in 2004 and the game was first announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) 2006 . Final Fantasy XIII is the flagship title of the Fabula Nova Crystallis collection of Final Fantasy games and is the first game to use Square Enix 's Crystal Tools engine . Final Fantasy XIII received mostly positive reviews from video game publications , which praised the game 's graphics , presentation , and battle system .

 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player directly controls the on @-@ screen character through a third @-@ person perspective to interact with people , objects , and enemies throughout the game . The player can also turn the camera around the characters , which allows for a 360 ° view of the surroundings . The world of Final Fantasy XIII is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it ; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain , as found in the earlier Final Fantasy games , every area is represented proportionally . The player navigates the world by foot or by chocobo . Players may save their game to a hard disk drive using save stations , where the player can also purchase items from retail networks or upgrade their weapons . An in @-@ game <unk> provides a bestiary and incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XIII . The Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International version of the game , released in Japan , also contains an " Easy " mode option . 
 = = = Battle system = = = 
 As in Final Fantasy XII , enemies are integrated into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player . When the player 's character touches an enemy , the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous Final Fantasy titles . A maximum of three characters may be used in battles , which use a variant on the series ' traditional Active Time Battle ( ATB ) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV . Under this system , the player selects an action from the menus , such as Attack , Magic , and Item . Unlike previous games in the series , the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game 's artificial intelligence ( AI ) . Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar , which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots . The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six . The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount . The player may select an <unk> command , which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically . Actions cannot be performed outside of battle , and the characters ' health is fully restored after each battle . 
 Each enemy has a meter , called a chain counter , consisting of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells . Attacks by different roles have different effects ; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets . The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to the enemy . When the chain counter reaches a preset amount , different for each enemy , the enemy is placed into Stagger State . In this mode , the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air . The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions . The roles consist of Commando , a warrior @-@ type role ; Ravager , a black mage @-@ type role which uses damage @-@ dealing magic ; Medic , a White Mage @-@ type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments ; Saboteur , which use magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses ; <unk> , which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses ; and Sentinel , which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin . Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles , but the player has access to all of them later in the game ( although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them ) . The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle , which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle . The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle . 
 Each character can summon a specific Eidolon into battle . These summoned creatures include series staples Odin , Shiva , Alexander , and Bahamut , and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr . When summoned , the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party . While an Eidolon is summoned , the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode , in which the Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them . 
 = = = Crystarium = = = 
 The Crystarium is a leveling system consisting of six crystals and resembles the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X. Each crystal in the Crystarium represents one of the six Paradigms , and is divided into ten levels . Each level contains various nodes that supply bonuses to health , strength , or magic , or provide new abilities and accessory slots . These nodes are connected by a semi @-@ linear path . The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points , which are awarded after defeating enemies . The full Crystarium is not available to the player at the beginning of the game ; at specific points in the game 's plot , the player gains access to new crystals or levels .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Final Fantasy XIII is set on the world of Gran Pulse ( often simply called Pulse ) . Central to the story is Cocoon , a massive artificial sphere that floats above Pulse 's surface and is ruled by the Sanctum , a theocratic government . The two worlds are controlled by fal 'Cie / <unk> / , beings with godlike power . The Cocoon fal 'Cie are responsible for keeping Cocoon floating , as well as providing light and water to the people that live inside . Each fal 'Cie handles a specific task . The fal 'Cie have the capability of marking the humans that live in Pulse and Cocoon as their servants . These servants , called l 'Cie / <unk> / , are branded with a symbol representing either Pulse or Cocoon and are given a " Focus " — a task to complete . If the l 'Cie complete their task in time , they are transformed to crystal and according to legend gain eternal life ; otherwise they become mindless monsters called Cie 'th / <unk> / . The l 'Cie are not explicitly told their Focus , but are instead given visions that they must interpret . 
 Several hundred years before the events of the game , a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon . During the battle , l 'Cie from Pulse attacked and ripped a large hole in Cocoon . Eventually , the l 'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal . The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse , and Cocoon 's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion ; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power . The Sanctum oversees two military branches : the Guardian Corps , responsible for keeping order on Cocoon , and the Public Security and Intelligence <unk> ( PSICOM ) , the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse . The fal 'Cie have given the humans advanced technology , including flying airships and mechanical creatures , and a form of magic also exists . This magic is normally only accessible to l 'Cie , fal 'Cie , and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse , though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans through the use of <unk> .

 The six main playable characters of Final Fantasy XIII are Lightning , the main protagonist of the game , a former soldier and older sister to Serah ; Snow Villiers , Serah 's fiancé and leader of NORA , a paramilitary group ; Oerba Dia Vanille , the game 's narrator and an exile who is later revealed to be a l 'Cie from Pulse ; Sazh Katzroy , a civilian pilot and father to a young boy , Dajh ; Hope Estheim , a young boy who is struggling within the relationships he shares with his parents ; and Oerba Yun Fang , a l 'Cie from Pulse who is working with the Sanctum 's Cavalry branch . Other characters include Galenth Dysley , the ruler of the Sanctum and main antagonist ; Cid Raines , a Sanctum Brigadier General in the Cavalry who does not trust the government ; and Serah Farron , Lightning 's younger sister and Snow 's fiancée . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Final Fantasy XIII begins in Cocoon as the citizens of the town of Bodhum are being evicted , or <unk> , from Cocoon after coming in contact with something from Pulse . Over the course of the game , the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous 13 days , which began when a fal 'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum . Lightning 's sister Serah had found the fal 'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l 'Cie by it . Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah . In the subsequent battle , Snow leads his resistance group , NORA , to rescue the Purge exiles . Several of them are killed , including Hope 's mother . As Snow heads to the fal 'Cie Anima to save Serah , he is joined by two of the exiles : Hope and Vanille . The two groups meet at the fal 'Cie , and find Serah just as she turns to crystal . Anima then brands them all as l 'Cie and they are cast out into a different part of Cocoon . During this transformation , the newly crested l 'Cie all have the same vision : a monster called Ragnarok . The group , arguing over the ambiguous nature of the dreamed Focus , find Serah in her crystallized form ; Snow remains with her as the others leave . 
 Snow meets Cid and Fang after being captured and detained aboard the airship Lindblum . Meanwhile , the others escape from PSICOM , but are separated during an air strike ; Hope and Lightning travel to Palumpolum , while Sazh and Vanille travel to Nautilus . In Lightning 's scenario , she unintentionally supports Hope 's goal of killing Snow as revenge for his mother 's death . In Vanille 's scenario , Sazh discusses how his son Dajh was turned into a l 'Cie by a Cocoon fal 'Cie and was taken by PSICOM to discover his Focus . At Palumpolum , Lightning tries to persuade Hope not to go through with his revenge and meets Snow and Fang . Fang reveals that she and Vanille were l 'Cie from Pulse who were turned into crystals ; they were turned back into humans 13 days prior to the start of the game , sparking the Purge . Hope attempts to murder Snow , but after Snow saves him from an airstrike , he decides not to go through with it . The party then escapes the city with Cid 's aid . At Nautilus , Vanille reveals herself to Sazh as a l 'Cie from Pulse , and indirectly the reason that Dajh was turned into a l 'Cie . PSICOM then captures Sazh and Vanille and detains them on board the airship Palamecia . 
 The other members of the party stage a rescue mission and reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley , the Sanctum 's Primarch . Dysley reveals himself as the Cocoon fal 'Cie ruler Barthandelus . He tells them that their Focus is to transform into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal 'Cie Orphan , who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse . Slaying the fal 'Cie Orphan will result in the destruction of Cocoon . The party escapes and learns from Cid that the fal 'Cie believe that Cocoon 's destruction will summon the Maker , the creator of the worlds . The fal 'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves . Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries prior , and that their Focus then had been the same : to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan . The party flies away to Pulse and travels to Oerba , Vanille and Fang 's hometown , where they hope to learn how to remove their l 'Cie marks . The town is deserted , and they find no living people on the surface . The group is unsuccessful in removing their marks , and Dysley confronts them again . He tells them that he is forcing Cid , now the head of the Sanctum , to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a coup d 'état . 
 The party infiltrates Cocoon with the goal of preventing its destruction . They head towards Orphan only to find that the Cavalry have been turned into Cie 'th . The party encounters Dysley and overpowers him , but Orphan awakens and merges with Dysley , then compels Fang to finish her Focus as Ragnarok while the others are seemingly transformed into Cie 'th . The group reappears in human form , preventing Fang from transforming . The party engage and defeat Orphan and escape Cocoon , which is now falling towards Pulse . As the rest of the party turns to crystal for completing their Focus , Vanille and Fang remain on Cocoon and transform into Ragnarok together . They prevent a collision between Cocoon and Pulse by turning themselves into a crystal pillar between the two worlds . The rest of the party awaken from their crystallization on Pulse and find their l 'Cie brands gone . The game ends with Lightning , Hope , Snow and Sazh reuniting with Serah and Dajh . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of Final Fantasy XIII began in February 2004 , shortly after the release of Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 International + Last Mission in Japan . Back then , the project was internally referred to by the codename " Colors World " . Over the first year , director Motomu Toriyama and scenario <unk> Kazushige Nojima conceived ideas for the plot . Nojima thought up the crystal mythology that became the basis for the Fabula Nova Crystallis series , including concepts such as the fal 'Cie and l 'Cie . Toriyama then created a story premised on this mythology . He wanted to portray " characters at the mercy of a predetermined , unjust fate " who " belong together but collide heavily " . In order to achieve this , each of the story 's thirteen chapters was made to focus on different protagonists . Chapters seven and eight were to mark a turning point in the interpersonal relationships of the party . 
 In March 2006 , when the structural part of the narrative started to come together , lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team . Toriyama gave him a rough outline of the first eight chapters , which included several cornerstone scenes that needed to be kept , like when party members were separated or reunited . He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected . For example , Toriyama 's rudimentary instructions in the document would say " Snow and Hope reconcile " . Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out , then write the scenario that way . To emphasize what the story tried to express , Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character . For example , he felt that the party should not have a " reliable and calm leader type " at the beginning of the story , in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l 'Cie . Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered . He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example : Although Toriyama felt it was " almost a little too dark " , he wanted to include something like it in the game . In contrast , he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh 's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance . 
 At the beginning of the development , the game was intended to be released on the PlayStation 2 . In May 2005 , however , after the positive reception of the tech demo of Final Fantasy VII , the team decided to move the game to the PlayStation 3 and developed it with the new Crystal Tools engine , a seventh generation multiplatform game engine created by Square Enix for its next generation games . Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project , though it would initially cause a delay in the game 's development . However , the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to XIII . Another factor in the platform move was the delayed release of Final Fantasy XII , which came out a very short time before the release of the PlayStation 3 . A PC port was considered during development , but was decided against due to how Square Enix saw the video game market situation at the time as well as additional complexities that Square Enix did not have experience with related to the PC platform , such as security issues . Final Fantasy XIII was first shown at the 2006 E3 convention . The trailer shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game , since at the time there was no playable form of the game . Announced alongside the game was Final Fantasy Versus XIII , later retitled as Final Fantasy XV , and the PlayStation Portable game Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 , originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII , the three of which form the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy series . Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked , they are not directly related in terms of story . 
 The developers for Final Fantasy XIII were divided into multiple areas , with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in @-@ game area or modeling characters . Each physical area of the game was developed separately ; after an initial design was approved , teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas . Several of the game 's developers had worked on previous installments of the series . Director Motomu Toriyama had worked on Final Fantasy X and X @-@ 2 ; producer Yoshinori Kitase had worked on V through VIII and as the producer for X and X @-@ 2 ; main @-@ character designer Tetsuya Nomura had performed the same role for VII , VIII , X , and X @-@ 2 , and battle @-@ system director Toshiro Tsuchida reprised that role from Final Fantasy X. As XIII was the first Final Fantasy game for the PlayStation 3 , the development team 's internal goal was for the game to have the same " gameplay and craftmanship " impact that Final Fantasy VII and X had as the first games of the series on their respective consoles . They aimed to sell five million copies of the game . Toriyama wanted the game to be " the ultimate single player RPG " . 
 Tsuchida 's concept for the battle system was to maintain the strategic nature of command @-@ based battles . The system stemmed from a desire to create battles similar to those found in the film Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children . Magic points ( MP ) , which had been a part of the battle system in previous Final Fantasy titles , were removed in the game 's battle system as Tsuchida and the other designers felt that it gave players an incentive to not use their most powerful magic attacks due to the MP cost , in turn making battles less interesting . The Paradigm system was designed early in the battle system 's development , with the intent of making battles rely on quickly changing strategies and feel fast @-@ moving . Originally there were only five roles , but the Saboteur was later added as the designers felt that its abilities were missing from the game and did not fit with the other roles . Together with the maximum of three characters in a combat situation , the groupings of enemies were designed to force the player to switch Paradigms to keep them engaged in the battles . 
 Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a new type of female character with an athlete 's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series . His guideline to Nomura was to make her " strong and beautiful " , and she was intended to be reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII 's Cloud Strife . Fang was initially meant to be a male character , but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development . The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before , such as Lightning 's cape and detailed facial features . This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games . Nomura did not take an involved role in the creation of the non @-@ playable characters . 
 Unlike previous games in the series which were more inspired by Asian locations and culture , Final Fantasy XIII was intended by the art team to be reminiscent of the United States . Pulse was based on landscape photographs the team took from across the country , and Cocoon was intended to be a " melting pot " of different ethnicities . The setting was also given a science fiction aesthetic to make it stand out more in comparison with other entries in the series . Art director Isamu Kamikokuryo revealed that many additional scenarios such as Lightning 's home , which were functioning in an unreleased build during development , were left out of the final version due to concerns about the game 's length and volume . Kamikokuryo said the content they cut was , in itself , enough to make another game . According to Toriyama , the cuts were made in " various stages of [ the game 's ] development " , and that some of the content was removed just before the game 's completion . The game , unlike previous titles in the series , includes no explorable town areas ; Toriyama said in an interview that the team was unable to make them as graphically appealing as the rest of the game and chose to eliminate them . Toriyama intended to have a piece of downloadable content available for the game that would include a new area , weapons and quests , but was forced to cut it as well due to quality concerns so late in the project and difficulties with the different systems for extra content on the two gaming consoles . 
 A playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII was included in the Japanese version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete , released on April 16 , 2009 . Toriyama stated that the release of the demo , which was not in the original development schedule , helped the team recognize a shared vision for what the game should look and feel like , a problem which had been plaguing the development team up until then . It helped the team prioritize the work that still needed to be done , which increased the development speed for the remainder of the project . The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences , and focus groups from both regions were used . The English localization began while development was still in progress to lessen the delay between the Japanese and worldwide releases . The game was initially going to be released solely for the PlayStation 3 , but an Xbox 360 version was announced late in the game 's development cycle . The Xbox version , due to technical limitations , runs at a lower resolution ( 720p maximum ) than the PlayStation version and is spread across 3 discs .

 Masashi Hamauzu composed the game 's soundtrack . His previous work on the series was as a co @-@ composer for Final Fantasy X and as the main composer for Dirge of Cerberus : Final Fantasy VII . The game was the first main @-@ series Final Fantasy game to not include any compositions by original series composer Nobuo Uematsu . Although Uematsu was originally announced to compose the main theme of the game , this role was taken over by Hamauzu after Uematsu signed on to compose the soundtrack to Final Fantasy XIV . The score features some pieces orchestrated by Yoshihisa Hirano , Toshiyuki Oomori , and <unk> Shiina , with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra . The song " My Hands " , from British singer Leona Lewis ' second album Echo , was chosen to replace Final Fantasy XIII 's original theme song , " Kimi ga Iru Kara " by Sayuri Sugawara , for the game 's international release . Square Enix President Yoichi Wada later said that it would have been better if the American branch of the company had produced a theme song from scratch , but a lack of staff led to the decision of licensing an existing song . 
 Music from the game has been released in several albums . Square Enix released the main soundtrack album , Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack , on four Compact Discs in 2010 . The album sold 16 @,@ 000 copies the day of its release . Square Enix released selections from the soundtrack on two gramophone record albums in 2010 : W / F : Music from Final Fantasy XIII and W / F : Music from Final Fantasy XIII Gentle Reveries . An album of arranged pieces from the soundtrack , Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack <unk> , was also released by Square Enix in 2010 , as was an album of piano arrangements . For Life Music published a single of the theme song for the Japanese version of the game , " Kimi ga Iru Kara " ( 君がいるから , " Because You 're Here " ) , in 2009 .

The game received a Best RPG of the year award nomination at the Spike Video Game Awards , but lost to Mass Effect 2 , Ali Hillis also voices Liara T 'Soni . It won the " Future Division " award at the Japan Game Awards 2009 and later won a Game Designers Award at the Japan Game Awards 2010 . 
 Universal praise was given to the technical milestones achieved by the game 's graphics and presentation . Edge felt that Cocoon in particular was an " inspired setting [ ... ] blessed with a vibrancy and vivid colour that often leaves you open @-@ mouthed " . GameSpot called the art design " magnificent " .

Many also appreciated the game 's soundtrack , with Masashi Hamauzu providing " a score with catchy hooks and blood @-@ pumping battle melodies " , according to Wired . 
 The battle system of Final Fantasy XIII received widespread praise . The increased pace of battles was appreciated , with several reviews describing it as " thrilling " ; Edge 's description of the battle system summarized it as " among the genre 's finest " . 1UP.com said that " Despite the fact that two @-@ thirds of your party is AI @-@ controlled , <unk> 's battles may be the most involving the series has ever seen . " The story got a mixed reception , with Wired remarking that the plot was " a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games " . 1UP.com felt that the story was " hardly world @-@ class writing " , but that the writers clearly knew the medium well and had attempted to avoid clichés . Reviewers felt that the characters worked well together , and that the interactions among them as the game progressed made up for shortcomings in the story .

 While critics generally praised Square Enix 's attempt to revitalize the Final Fantasy series formula , many reacted negatively to the linear nature of the game , especially in the first ten chapters on Cocoon , an issue which many felt was compounded by the large reduction of towns , free @-@ roaming capabilities , and interaction with non @-@ player characters . GamePro described the gameplay as " a long hallway toward an orange target symbol on your mini @-@ map that triggers a cutscene , a boss fight , or both , " and 1UP.com criticized the linear aspect as the game 's " biggest shortcoming " , and felt the first section was " superficial . " Edge and others awarded the game especially lower scores as a result of these aspects , with Edge in particular lowering the score they awarded the game to a five out of ten primarily due to the game 's linear nature . 
 In contrast , reviewers from GamesRadar and Computer and Video Games appreciated the linear nature ; the former stated that " the streamlined , focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down " , while the latter felt it was " a clever move " , and kept the player from being " [ bogged ] down with mundane number crunching , [ and ] finicky and repetitive leveling @-@ up . " Many negatively noted the gradual unfurling of the player 's abilities over this first part of the game , from battle gameplay to selecting the party leader . Combined with the game 's linear nature , some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as " boring " until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed . Edge noted that while it did not do enough to make up for the opening chapters , at Gran Pulse the game " hits a sweet spot " as the narrative offers " hunting side @-@ quests and the simple joy of exploring to see what visual marvel is around the next corner . "

 After release , director Motomu Toriyama felt that the lower @-@ than @-@ expected review scores for a main Final Fantasy series game came from reviewers who approached the game from a Western point of view . These reviewers were used to games in which the player was given an open world to explore , he said , noting that this expectation contrasted with the vision the team set out to create . He noted that it " becomes very difficult to tell a compelling story when you 're given that much freedom " . Yoshinori Kitase stated that they " didn 't really intend to work within the RPG template , " but " wanted to create a new game , even a new genre . " He stated that " in a lot of senses <unk> is more like an FPS than an RPG . " 
 Toriyama and Kitase later said , in July 2011 , that the biggest complaints about the game were that it was too linear and that there was not enough interaction between the player and the world , which they described as a lack of towns and minigames compared to the previous Final Fantasy games . They also named the amount of time it took to access all of the gameplay elements as a common criticism , saying that people interpreted it as a " lengthy tutorial " . 
 Yoichi Wada , then @-@ president of Square Enix , made his thoughts about the reception of the game known to Gamasutra . He said " some value it highly and some are not very happy with it " . He added , " Should Final Fantasy become a new type of game or should Final Fantasy not become a new type of game ? The customers have different opinions . It 's very difficult to determine which way it should go . "

 When Harry Met Sally … is a 1989 American romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner . It stars Billy Crystal as Harry and Meg Ryan as Sally . The story follows the title characters from the time they meet just before sharing a cross @-@ country drive , through twelve years or so of chance encounters in New York City . The film raises the question " Can men and women ever just be friends ? " and advances many ideas about relationships that became household concepts , such as those of the " high @-@ maintenance " girlfriend and the " transitional person " . 
 The origins of the film were derived from Reiner 's return to single life after a divorce . An interview Ephron conducted with Reiner provided the basis for Harry . Sally was based on Ephron and some of her friends . Crystal came on board and made his own contributions to the screenplay , making Harry funnier . Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real @-@ life friendship between Reiner and Crystal . The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr . , with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman . Connick won his first Grammy Award for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance . 
 Columbia Pictures released the film using the " platform " technique , which involved opening it in a few select cities , letting positive word of mouth generate interest , and then gradually expanding distribution over subsequent weeks . When Harry Met Sally ... grossed a total of US $ 92 @.@ 8 million in North America . Ephron received a British Academy Film Award , an Oscar nomination , and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for her screenplay . The film is ranked 23rd on AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs list of the top comedy films in American cinema and number 60 on Bravo 's " 100 Funniest Movies " . In early 2004 , the film was adapted for the stage in a production starring Luke Perry and Alyson Hannigan .

Harry is dating a friend of Sally 's , Amanda ( Michelle Nicastro ) . During the drive , they discuss their differing ideas about relationships between men and women . Harry says that " Men and women can 't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way . " Sally disagrees , claiming that men and women can be strictly friends without sex . During a stop in a diner , Sally is angered when Harry tells her she is attractive ; she accuses him of making a pass at her . In New York , they part on unfriendly terms . 
 Five years later , Harry and Sally find themselves on the same flight .

Harry suggests they become friends , forcing him to qualify his previous " rule " about the impossibility of male @-@ female friendships . Despite Harry 's suggestions of exceptions to that rule , they separate , concluding that they will not be friends . 
 Harry and Sally run into each other again in a bookstore five years later . They have coffee and talk about their previous relationships ; Sally and Joe broke up because she wanted a family and he did not want to marry , and Harry 's relationship ended when Helen fell in love with another man .

 In 1984 , director Rob Reiner , producer Andy Scheinman and writer Nora Ephron met over lunch at the Russian Tea Room in New York City to develop a project . Reiner pitched an idea for a film that Ephron rejected . The second meeting transformed into a long discussion about Reiner and Scheinman 's lives as single men . Reiner remembers , " I was in the middle of my single life . I 'd been divorced for a while . I 'd been out a number of times , all these disastrous , confusing relationships one after another " . The next time they all met , Reiner said that he had always wanted to do a film about two people who become friends and do not have sex because they know it will ruin their relationship but have sex anyway . Ephron liked the idea , and Reiner acquired a deal at a studio . 
 She then proceeded to interview Reiner and Scheinman about their lives in order to have material on which to draw . These interviews also provided the basis for Harry . Reiner was constantly depressed , pessimistic yet very funny . Ephron also got bits of dialogue from these interviews . Sally was based on Ephron and some of her friends . She worked on several drafts over the years while Reiner made Stand By Me and The Princess Bride . Billy Crystal came on board when the project was called Boy Meets Girl and made his own contributions to the screenplay , making Harry funnier . The comedian " experienced vicariously " Reiner 's ( his best friend at the time ) return to single life after divorcing comedian / filmmaker Penny Marshall and in the process was unconsciously doing research for the role of Harry . 
 During the screenwriting process when Ephron would not feel like writing , she would interview people who worked for the production company . Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met , although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors . Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real @-@ life friendship between Reiner and Crystal . For example , in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen , talking on the telephone while watching their respective television sets , channel surfing , was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night . 
 Originally , Ephron wanted to call the film How They Met and went through several different titles . Reiner even started a contest with the crew during principal photography - whoever came up with the title won a case of champagne . In order to get into the lonely mindset of Harry when he was divorced and single , Crystal stayed by himself in a separate room from the cast and crew while they were shooting in Manhattan . The script initially ended with Harry and Sally remaining friends and not pursuing a romantic relationship because she felt that was " the true ending " , as did Reiner . Eventually , Ephron and Reiner realized that it would be a more appropriate ending for them to marry , though they admit that this is generally not a realistic outcome . 
 When posed the film 's central question , can men and women just be friends , Ryan replied , " Yes , men and women can just be friends . I have a lot of platonic ( male ) friends , and sex doesn 't get in the way . " Crystal said , " I 'm a little more optimistic than Harry . But I think it is difficult . Men basically act like stray dogs in front of a supermarket . I do have platonic ( women ) friends , but not best , best , best friends . " 
 Rob Reiner initially envisioned actress Susan Dey for the role of Sally Albright . When she declined , he later considered Elizabeth Perkins . He also considered casting Elizabeth McGovern . Molly Ringwald was almost cast , but Meg Ryan convinced Reiner to give her the role . Reiner 's mother Estelle and daughter Tracy both played roles in the film . 
 = = = Deli scene = = = 
 In a scene featuring the two title characters having lunch at Katz 's Delicatessen in Manhattan , the couple are arguing about a man 's ability to recognize when a woman is faking an orgasm . Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference , and to prove her point , she vividly ( fully clothed ) fakes one as other diners watch . The scene ends with Sally casually returning to her meal as a nearby patron ( played by Reiner 's mother ) places her order : " I 'll have what she 's having . " When Estelle Reiner died at age 94 in 2008 , The New York Times referred to her as the woman " who delivered one of the most memorably funny lines in movie history " . This scene was shot again and again , and Ryan demonstrated her fake orgasms for hours . Katz 's Deli still hangs a sign above the table that says , " Where Harry met Sally ... hope you have what she had ! " 
 This classic scene was born when the film started to focus too much on Harry . Crystal remembers saying , " ' We need something for Sally to talk about , ' and Nora said , ' Well , faking orgasm is a great one , ' and right away we said , ' Well , the subject is good , ' and then Meg came on board and we talked with her about the nature of the idea and she said , ' Well , why don 't I just fake one , just do one ? ' " Ryan suggested that the scene take place in a restaurant , and it was Crystal who came up with the scene 's classic punchline – " I 'll have what she 's having . " In 2005 , the quote was listed 33rd on the AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movie Quotes list of memorable movie lines . Reiner recalls that at a test screening , all of the women in the audience were laughing while all of the men were silent . 
 In late 2013 , Improv Everywhere , the New York City initiative behind the annual No Pants Day in the subways and various flash @-@ mob stunts , convened and filmed a re @-@ enactment . While a look @-@ alike couple performed the scene , 30 others joined as if it was contagious . Surprised staff and customers responded in appreciation . The film and follow @-@ up interviews are public . In October of the same year , Katz Delicatessen invited Baron Von Fancy to display his ten @-@ foot high mural quoting the famous line in its pop @-@ up gallery next door , The Space .

 The When Harry Met Sally ... soundtrack album features American singer and pianist Harry Connick Jr . Bobby Colomby , the drummer for Blood , Sweat & Tears , was a friend of Reiner 's and recommended Harry Connick Jr . , giving the director a tape of the musician 's music . Reiner was struck by Connick 's voice and how he sounded like a young Frank Sinatra . The movie 's soundtrack album was released by Columbia Records in July 1989 . The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr. with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman . Connick won his first Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance . 
 Arrangements and orchestrations on " It Had to Be You " , " Where or When " , " I Could Write a Book " , and " But Not for Me " are by Connick and Shaiman . Other songs were performed as piano / vocal solos , or with Connick 's trio featuring Benjamin Jonah Wolfe on bass and Jeff " Tain " Watts on drums . Also appearing on the album are tenor saxophonist Frank <unk> and guitarist Joy Berliner . The soundtrack went to # 1 on the Billboard Traditional Jazz Chart and was within the top 50 on the Billboard 200 . Connick also toured North America in support of this album . It went on to reach double @-@ platinum status . 
 The music in the film is performed by various artists , such as Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald , Frank Sinatra , Ray Charles , Bing Crosby , and Harry Connick Jr .

Billy Crystal was worried that the film would flop at the box office because it was up against several summer blockbuster films , like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Batman . The film went into wide release on July 21 , 1989 , and grossed $ 8 @.@ 8 million on its opening weekend in 775 theaters . This was later expanded to 1 @,@ 174 theaters and the film grossed a total of $ 92 @.@ 8 million in North America , well above its $ 16 million budget .

 Reviews for When Harry Met Sally ... were positive . It has a rating of 89 % on Rotten Tomatoes , summarized in the view that : " Rob Reiner 's touching , funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies , and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan " . On Metacritic , the film has a score of 76 out of 100 , based on 17 critics . 
 The film led Roger Ebert to call Reiner " one of Hollywood 's very best directors of comedy " , and said that it was " most conventional , in terms of structure and the way it fulfills our expectations . But what makes it special , apart from the Ephron screenplay , is the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan . " In a review for The New York Times , Caryn James called When Harry Met Sally ... an " often funny but amazingly hollow film " that " romanticized lives of intelligent , successful , neurotic New Yorkers " ; James characterized it as " the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film , full of amusing lines and scenes , all infused with an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu " . 
 Rita Kempley 's review in The Washington Post praised Meg Ryan as the " summer 's Melanie Griffith – a honey @-@ haired blonde who finally finds a showcase for her sheer exuberance . Neither naif nor vamp , she 's a woman from a pen of a woman , not some Cinderella of a Working Girl . " Mike Clark , of USA Today , gave the film three out of four stars , writing , " Crystal is funny enough to keep Ryan from all @-@ out stealing the film . She , though , is smashing in an eye @-@ opening performance , another tribute to Reiner 's flair with actors . " David Ansen provided one of the rare negative reviews of the film for Newsweek . He criticized the casting of Crystal , " Not surprisingly he handles the comedy superbly , but he 's too cool and self @-@ protective an actor to work as a romantic leading man " , and felt that as a film , " of wonderful parts , it doesn 't quite add up " .

 = SMS Dresden ( 1917 ) = 
 SMS Dresden was the second and final ship of the Cöln class of light cruisers to be completed and commissioned in the Kaiserliche Marine . The ship was laid down in 1916 and launched on 25 April 1917 ; she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 28 March 1918 . She and her sister Cöln were the only two of her class to be completed ; eight of her sisters were scrapped before they could be completed . The ships were an incremental improvement over the preceding Königsberg @-@ class cruisers . 
 Dresden was commissioned into service with the High Seas Fleet eight months before the end of World War I ; as a result , her service career was limited and she did not see action . She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia , but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port . Dresden was to have participated in a climactic sortie in the final days of the war , but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper to cancel the operation . The ship was interned in Scapa Flow after the end of the war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919 , under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Dresden was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Ariadne " and was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1916 . She was launched on 25 April 1917 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 28 March 1918 . The ship was 155 @.@ 5 meters ( 510 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 14 @.@ 2 m ( 47 ft ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 01 m ( 19 @.@ 7 ft ) forward . She displaced 7 @,@ 486 t ( 7 @,@ 368 long tons ; 8 @,@ 252 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of steam turbines powered by eight coal @-@ fired and six oil @-@ fired Marine @-@ type boilers . These provided a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 kn ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) and a range of approximately 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 000 km ; 6 @,@ 900 mi ) at 12 kn ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . 
 The ship was armed with eight 15 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , four were located amidships , two on either side , and two were arranged in a super firing pair aft . These guns fired a 45 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 20 @.@ 5 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 840 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 800 ft / s ) . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 17 @,@ 600 m ( 57 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 040 rounds of ammunition , for 130 shells per gun . Dresden also carried three 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) L / 45 anti @-@ aircraft guns mounted on the centerline astern of the funnels , though one was removed in 1918 . She was also equipped with a pair of 60 cm ( 24 in ) torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes in deck @-@ mounted swivel launchers amidships . She also carried 200 mines . The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides , and the deck was covered with 60 mm thick armor plate . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After her commissioning , Dresden joined the reconnaissance screen for the High Seas Fleet . She was the last light cruiser built by the Kaiserliche Marine . The ship was assigned to the II Scouting Group , alongside the cruisers Königsberg , Pillau , Graudenz , Nürnberg , and Karlsruhe . The ships were in service in time for the major fleet operation to Norway in 23 – 24 April 1918 . The I Scouting Group and II Scouting Group , along with the Second Torpedo @-@ Boat Flotilla , were to attack a heavily guarded British convoy to Norway , with the rest of the High Seas Fleet steaming in support . The Germans failed to locate the convoy , which had in fact sailed the day before the fleet left port . As a result , Admiral Reinhard Scheer broke off the operation and returned to port . 
 In October 1918 , Dresden and the rest of the II Scouting Group were to lead a final attack on the British navy . Dresden , Cöln , Pillau , and Königsberg were to attack merchant shipping in the Thames estuary while the rest of the Group were to bombard targets in Flanders , to draw out the British Grand Fleet . Großadmiral Reinhard Scheer , the commander in chief of the fleet , intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , in order to secure a better bargaining position for Germany , whatever the cost to the fleet . On the morning of 29 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on Thüringen and then on several other battleships mutinied . The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation . 
 During the sailors ' revolt , Dresden was ordered to steam to Eckernförde to serve as a relay to Kiel . Communications had been disrupted by major unrest there . The battleship Markgraf laid in Dresden 's path , and her unruly crew refused to move out of Dresden 's way ; Markgraf aimed one of her 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) gun turrets at Dresden , but then her crew backed down and let Dresden leave the port . The ship then went to Swinemünde , where her crew partially scuttled her following reports that mutinous ships were en route to attack the cruisers stationed there . After these proved false , Dresden was re @-@ floated and returned to seaworthy condition . This involved removing the ammunition for all of the guns and allowing them to air @-@ dry . Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918 , most of the High Seas Fleet 's ships , under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter , were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow . Dresden was among the ships interned , but owing to her poor condition following the naval mutiny , she was not able to steam with the rest of the fleet in November . She arrived on 6 December , leaking badly . 
 The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty . Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919 , which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty . Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd , Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers , and at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships . Dresden began to sink at 13 : 50 . Her wreck lies to this day on her port side at the bottom of Scapa Flow to the south east of the island of Cava , in a depth of 25 to 45 meters ( 82 to 148 ft ) . Her upper decks have been badly damaged ; her weather deck has fallen off , exposing her internal structure . Her guns are buried in mud .

 Route 284 is a 7 @.@ 03 @-@ mile ( 11 @.@ 31 km ) state highway in New Jersey , United States , running from Route 23 in Sussex north to the New York state line in Wantage Township . New York State Route 284 continues north to U.S. Route 6 at Slate Hill , New York . The route is a connector to Unionville , and intersects with an old alignment of its original designation , Route 84 . Route 284 was first a part of Route 8 in the 1920s , becoming Route 8N in 1927 and Route 84 in 1942 before being assigned Route 284 in 1966 .

 Route 284 begins at a signaled intersection in Sussex with NJ 23 . The route proceeds northward , intersecting with Sussex County Route 643 at less than a half @-@ mile into the highway . Route 284 leaves the borough of Sussex and enters Wantage Township , intersecting with Layton Road , Janice Drive , and Possum River Road . Route 284 passes to the south of a lake , crosses over a branch of the Wallkill River and intersects with County Route 642 ( <unk> Bridge Road ) . Just after the intersection with Route 642 , the rural highway crosses over <unk> Brook . At 5 @.@ 41 miles ( 8 @.@ 71 km ) , Route 284 intersects with an old routing of its original designation , NJ 84 . The original alignment merges in with NJ 284 less than a mile later .

 Route 8 , one of the routes assigned before the 1927 renumbering , ran largely along the present Route 23 corridor , but at Sussex it turned north rather than continuing northwest through High Point State Park . The section from Sussex north to the state line was taken over by the state in 1919 . In the 1927 renumbering , the majority of Route 8 became Route 23 . The part north of Sussex was proposed to become part of Route 31 , but that was instead moved to the present Route 94 corridor in the final version of the bill . As Route 8 north of Sussex was not assigned a number , the State Highway Commission appended a suffix of N ( to distinguish it from new Route 8 ) , forming Route 8N . The connecting route in New York had been numbered New York State Route 8 to match New Jersey , but in the 1930 renumbering it became New York State Route 84 , in order to free up the number 8 for a longer route . New Jersey renumbered its Route 8N to New Jersey Route 84 in March 1942 to match , in part to provide a single number for military caravans during World War II . 
 The final renumbering was made in 1966 , when Interstate 84 opened in New York . As the new I @-@ 84 was close to the older Route 84 , Route 84 was renumbered in both New York and New Jersey to Route 284 .

 = Piotr Skarga = 
 Piotr Skarga ( less often , Piotr <unk> ; 2 February 1536 – 27 September 1612 ) was a Polish Jesuit , preacher , hagiographer , polemicist , and leading figure of the Counter @-@ Reformation in the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth . Due to his oratorical gifts , he has been called " the Polish <unk> " . 
 Skarga is remembered by Poles as a vigorous early advocate of reforms to the Polish @-@ Lithuanian polity , and as a critic of the Commonwealth 's governing classes , as well as of its religious tolerance policies . He advocated strengthening the monarch 's power at the expense of parliament ( the Sejm ) and of the nobility ( the szlachta ) . 
 He was a professor at the Kraków Academy and in 1579 he became the first rector of the Wilno Academy . Later , he served in the Jesuit College at Kraków . He was also a prolific writer , and his Lives of the Saints ( Żywoty świętych , 1579 ) was for several centuries one of the most popular books in the Polish language . His other important work was the Sejm Sermons ( Kazania Sejmowe , 1597 ) , a political treatise , which became popular in the second half of the 19th century , when he was seen as the " patriotic seer " who predicted the partitions of Poland . 
 = = Life = = 
 Skarga was born on 2 February 1536 , north of Grójec , in the small folwark ( manor ) of <unk> ( also known as <unk> or <unk> ) . His family are often described as lesser landless szlachta ( gentry , or nobility ) , but it seems likely most of his ancestors had been peasants , later townsfolk who had only recently become minor nobility . He was reared at the family estate , and lost his parents when he was young ; his mother died when he was eight years old , and his father , Michał Skarga , four years later . Thereafter he was supported by his brothers , one of whom , Stanisław Skarga , was a priest . Piotr started his education at a parochial school in Grójec before moving to Kraków , where in 1552 he enrolled at the Kraków Academy , precursor to Jagiellonian University . His teachers included the priests Marcin <unk> and Jan <unk> . He finished his studies in 1555 . 
 Immediately after he finished his education , he served for two years as rector of the collegiate school at St. John 's Church in Warsaw . From October 1557 he tutored Jan Tęczyński , son of magnate Andrzej Tęczyński , and visited Vienna with his pupil , where he likely became closely acquainted with the Society of Jesus , a key order of the counter @-@ reformation . He then returned to Poland , which emerged as one of the main terrains of struggle between the Protestant Reformation movement and the Catholic Church 's counter @-@ reformation . From 1562 he served as a parson in Rohatyn , and around 1564 he took holy orders . That year he became a canon , and the following year he also served as chancellor of the Lwów chapter . From 1566 to 1567 he was chaplain at the court of castellan Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski ( the royal secretary to King Sigismund II Augustus ) ; after Tarnowski 's death he returned to Lwów , taking up the position of the cathedral preacher . 
 In 1568 he departed for Rome , arriving in 1569 and joining the Society of Jesus . In 1571 he returned to Poland , and preached successively at <unk> , Lwów , Jarosław , Warsaw ( where he delivered a sermon before the Sejm ) and Płock , where he visited the court of Queen Anna Jagiellon , who would become one of his patrons . A leading proponent of counter @-@ reformation , Skarga commonly preached against non @-@ Catholic denominations and helped secure funds and privileges for the Society of Jesus . 
 In 1573 he was rector of the Wilno Jesuit College , precursor to the Wilno Academy ( Vilnius University ) . In 1577 he became a professor at the Kraków Academy . That year he also finished one of his most important works , The Lives of the Saints ( Żywoty świętych ) , which was published two years later . In 1579 he became the first rector of the Wilno Academy . 
 In 1576 he published Pro <unk> Eucharistia contra <unk> <unk> , ad <unk> <unk> ( For the Most Sacred Eucharist , against the Zwinglian Heresy , to Andrzej Wolan ) . In 1582 he published Artes duodecim <unk> , sive <unk> @-@ <unk> ( The Seven Pillars on Which Stands Catholic Doctrine on the Most Sacred Sacrament of the Altar ) . Both these works formed part of Skarga 's dialogue with the Calvinist author Andrzej Wolan , which took the form of a series of rival polemics over a number of years . Wolan was a notable figure in the Commonwealth politics — not only a publicist , but a royal secretary , diplomat and Sejm deputy . 
 In 1584 Skarga was transferred to the new Jesuit College at Kraków . On 26 March 1587 he founded the Polish version of the Mount of Piety , a pawnbroker run as a charity and called in Polish the Bank <unk> ( lit. the Pious Bank ) . In 1588 the newly elected King Sigismund III Vasa established the new post of court preacher , and Skarga became the first priest to hold it . Skarga became a valued adviser to the King , and Sigismund became so fond of him that when the priest considered retirement , Sigismund rejected this , requesting that he remain at court for as long as possible . 
 As part of his Counter @-@ Reformation policies , Skarga was also a major proponent of the Union of Brest , a merger between the Roman Catholic Church and a faction of the Eastern Orthodox Church . His influence on King Sigismund , whom he supported ( or encouraged ) in opposing religious tolerance and seeking to strengthen royal power , was a factor that has been cited as a cause of the civil war — the ( ultimately unsuccessful ) Zebrzydowski Rebellion of 1606 — in which the royal faction confronted a popular movement among the nobility , led by the Zebrzydowski family , who sought to depose Sigismund . Some critics referred to Skarga as " the principal mischief @-@ maker of the Kingdom " ( in the Latin , " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) . 
 In 1611 he delivered his final sermon before the Sejm and published his final work , an ideological testament , <unk> do <unk> <unk> <unk> ( A Call for One Redeeming Faith ) . He remained Sigismund 's court preacher until April 1612 , four months before his death . 
 Skarga died on 27 September 1612 and was buried in the Saints Peter and Paul Church in Kraków . 
 = = Writer = = 
 In addition to being a popular and well @-@ known preacher , Skarga was the author of numerous theological texts and polemics , and it is as a writer that his fame has endured . 
 His two most important works are The Lives of the Saints ( Żywoty świętych , 1579 ) and Sejm Sermons ( Kazania Sejmowe , 1597 ) . The former , a hagiography , won him fame in his lifetime , while the Sermons gained recognition only in subsequent centuries , during the Partitions of Poland . Tazbir describes the Lives as Skarga 's chief work and as a major attack on the religious tolerance promoted by the Warsaw Confederation . The book was immensely popular , the first edition selling out by 1583 . A second edition was published in 1585 , and by the mid @-@ 17th century twelve editions had been printed , making it one of the most popular books published in Poland and Lithuania in that era ( rivaled by the <unk> Polska — Polish Chronicles — of Marcin Bielski ) . It was Skarga 's most popular work and continued to rank highly with Polish readers until the 18th and 19th centuries , when it was eclipsed by his Sermons . 
 The Sermons , a political treatise composed in the guise of sermons , went almost unnoticed by contemporaries . In the Sermons , Skarga discusses what he sees as the problems of the ailing Commonwealth : lack of patriotism , internal quarrels , tolerance of heretics , the king 's relative powerlessness , perverse laws ( a critique of the nobility 's Golden Freedoms ) , and immorality . Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs ( the peasants ) . 
 = = Importance = = 
 Janusz Tazbir , in his 1978 biography of Skarga , noted that " there already is an extensive literature on Skarga " . He attributed this to Skarga 's being the most famous figure of the Polish Counter @-@ Reformation , which gained him his initial fame ; and , later , to his rediscovered reform proposals which , while controversial in his time , gained him renown during the Partitions of Poland and have been well regarded since . 
 His popularity as the " patriotic seer " who predicted the Partitions reached a zenith in the second half of the 19th century , when some historians , such as Ignacy Chrzanowski , went so far as to speak of " the cult of Skarga . " Tazbir states that Skarga 's writings are valued primarily for their advocacy of political and socioeconomic reforms , rather than for their theological content . 
 From the Polish Enlightenment of the middle of the 18th century onward , his works , penned in Polish rather than in Latin , have also been increasingly valued for their style and contributions to the development of the written Polish language and of Polish literature . Skarga has been positively viewed not only by historians but by such luminaries of Polish culture as poet Adam Mickiewicz and painter Jan Matejko ; the former called Skarga 's Lives a " most poetic Polish masterpiece " , and the latter created a well @-@ known painting , <unk> <unk> ( Skarga 's Sermon ) . 
 Over the centuries , Skarga became a character in a number of other artistic works , including a novel by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski , though he has never been the chief character in any literary work longer than a poem . 
 In 1936 , on the 400th anniversary of Skarga 's birth , with the endorsement of Poland 's President Ignacy Mościcki and the Polish government , the Polish writer Zofia Kossak @-@ Szczucka proposed that Skarga be beatified . Nearly eight decades later , Skarga 's cause for beatification was inaugurated on 12 June 2013 . 
 In 2012 , on the 400th anniversary of his death , the Polish Sejm declared that year the " Year of the Reverend Piotr Skarga " .

 = HMAS Sydney ( D48 ) = 
 HMAS Sydney , named after the Australian city of Sydney , was one of three modified Leander @-@ class light cruisers operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Ordered for the Royal Navy as HMS Phaeton , the cruiser was purchased by the Australian government and renamed prior to her 1934 launch . 
 During the early part of her operational history , Sydney helped enforce sanctions during the Abyssinian crisis , and at the start of World War II was assigned to convoy escort and patrol duties in Australian waters . In May 1940 , Sydney joined the British Mediterranean Fleet for an eight @-@ month deployment , during which she sank two Italian warships , participated in multiple shore bombardments , and provided support to the Malta Convoys , while receiving minimal damage and no casualties . On her return to Australia in February 1941 , Sydney resumed convoy escort and patrol duties in home waters . 
 On 19 November 1941 , Sydney was involved in a mutually destructive engagement with the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran , and was lost with all 645 aboard . The wrecks of both ships were lost until 2008 ; Sydney was found on 17 March , five days after her adversary . Sydney 's defeat is commonly attributed to the proximity of the two ships during the engagement , and Kormoran 's advantages of surprise and rapid , accurate fire . However , the cruiser 's loss with all hands compared to the survival of most of the Germans have resulted in controversy , with some alleging that the German commander used illegal ruses to lure Sydney into range , that a Japanese submarine was involved , and that the true events of the battle are concealed behind a wide @-@ ranging cover up . 
 = = Construction and acquisition = = 
 The ship was laid down by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson at Wallsend @-@ on @-@ Tyne , England , on 8 July 1933 for the Royal Navy as HMS Phaeton , named after the Greek mythological figure . However , in 1934 , the Australian government was seeking a replacement for the light cruiser HMAS Brisbane , and negotiated to purchase Phaeton while she was still under construction . The cruiser was renamed after the capital city of New South Wales , and was launched on 22 September 1934 by the wife of Stanley Bruce , former Prime Minister of Australia and the serving Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom . Sydney was commissioned into the RAN on 24 September 1935 , drawing her ship 's company from Brisbane , which had been decommissioned earlier that day . 
 Following the announcement that Australia was purchasing a British @-@ built cruiser , there was criticism , primarily from the Opposition of the day , stating that such a warship should be built using Australian resources and labour . Several reasons were given in reply for acquiring British @-@ built cruisers instead of Australian @-@ made : the ship was already close to completion , the pending threat of war meant that there was not enough time to train Australians in the necessary shipbuilding skills , and that of the two cruisers built in Australian shipyards , one ( HMAS Adelaide ) had taken seven years to complete . 
 = = Design = = 
 Sydney was one of three Modified Leander @-@ class light cruisers acquired by the RAN during the late 1930s . Although the first ship of the class to join the RAN , Sydney was the second ship to be laid down , although the first to be completed , in what was sometimes referred to as the Perth class : Perth and Hobart operated with the Royal Navy for a short period before they were purchased by Australia in 1938 . Like most British cruisers , the Leanders were designed for long range patrols , scouting , and trade protection duties . 
 Sydney 's displacement ranged between 6 @,@ 701 tons ( light ) and 8 @,@ 940 tons ( full load ) , with a standard displacement of 7 @,@ 198 tons : improved fabrication and welding techniques made her 52 tons lighter than her sister ships . She had a length of 530 feet ( 160 m ) between perpendiculars and 562 feet 4 inches ( 171 @.@ 40 m ) overall , a beam of 56 feet 8 @.@ 5 inches ( 17 @.@ 285 m ) , and a draught at standard displacement between 15 feet 3 inches ( 4 @.@ 65 m ) forward and 17 feet 3 inches ( 5 @.@ 26 m ) aft . 
 The ship was propelled by four Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers , feeding Parsons single reduction geared turbines , which supplied 72 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 54 @,@ 000 kW ) to the four propeller shafts . Unlike the first five Leanders , which had their machinery arranged on the " in @-@ line " principle ( consisting of six boilers in three compartments forward , and four turbines in two further compartments aft ) , Sydney was designed with two redundant machinery groups , a design practice adopted from the United States Navy . The cruiser had two boilers and the turbines for the outer shafts forward , and two boilers and the turbines for the inner shafts aft ; as steam from any boiler could be routed to any turbine , the ship could continue operating if one space was damaged . Each space had its own uptake , giving the modified ships a different profile to the single @-@ funnelled early Leanders ; an arrangement which contributed to naval historian Henry Lenton 's description of the Modified Leanders as " the most handsome cruisers ever built by the Royal Navy , with a symmetry that was as attractive as it was functional . " 
 Sydney and her sister ships were constructed from 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) hull plating , with a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) armour belt over the machinery spaces ( the lengthening of this belt from 84 to 141 feet ( 26 to 43 m ) to adequately cover both spaces negated the weight reduction from their reorganisation ) , and 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) plates over the shell rooms and magazines . Sydney was the first Australian warship fitted with <unk> ; a Type 125 unit in a retractable pattern 3069 dome . The retractable sonar dome , located near the bow , was a weak point in the hull . 
 One of the cruiser 's early commanding officers , Royal Navy Captain <unk> Waller , believed that the ship 's single director control tower was a weak point in the design . The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship , from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo , then transmit this information to the gun turrets : the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret . Waller believed that the centralised system could be destroyed with a single hit , or the wiring linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed , forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control . Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy , it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns , and combat experiences of other Leander @-@ class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Sydney 's main armament consisted of eight 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) breech @-@ loading Mk XXIII guns mounted in four Mk XXI twin turrets : " A " and " B " forward , " X " and " Y " aft . All eight guns could be fired in salvo , elevated to an angle of 60 ° and depressed to − 5 ° , and fire eight rounds a minute at targets up to 24 @,@ 800 yards ( 22 @,@ 700 m ) away . 
 Four 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) quick firing Mk V guns , mounted on single , high angle , Mk IV mountings , were fitted to a platform around the aft funnel . These were primarily used to target aircraft at heights up to 28 @,@ 750 feet ( 8 @,@ 760 m ) , but could also be used against surface targets , with a maximum range of 16 @,@ 300 yards ( 14 @,@ 900 m ) . Their replacement with eight Mk XIX high @-@ angle / low @-@ angle guns in four twin mounts , which was to occur in the late 1930s , was prevented by the outbreak of World War II . The guns could have been swapped out during a maintenance docking , but the demand for cruisers and Sydney 's fortune in never sustaining major damage meant that the additional time in dock could not be justified . For close @-@ range anti @-@ aircraft defence , the 4 @-@ inch guns were supplemented by twelve 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) Vickers Mk III machine guns , which were arranged in three Mk II quadruple mountings , one on each side of the forward superstructure , and the third on top of the aft superstructure . 
 A mixture of 0 @.@ 303 @-@ inch ( 7 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns were used for close defence work , and could be fitted to pedestals at various points on the ship , primarily around the bridge and on the three searchlight platforms ( one either side of the forward funnel , the third raised above the aft superstructure ) . At launch , Sydney carried fourteen Lewis machine guns and two Vickers machine guns , but by the start of World War II , the Lewis guns had been reduced to nine , and the Vickers guns removed completely . 
 Eight 21 @-@ inch ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes were fitted in two QR Mk VII quadruple mounts to the deck below the platform for the 4 @-@ inch guns . Only eight Mark 9 torpedoes were carried . Sydney was fitted with a single depth charge rail at the stern , which held five Mk VII depth charges . Four 3 @-@ pounder ( 47 @-@ mm , 1 @.@ 9 @-@ in ) quick @-@ firing Hotchkiss guns were carried as saluting guns . These were removed during the August 1940 refit . 
 Sydney was fitted with a 53 @-@ foot ( 16 m ) , cordite @-@ powered revolving catapult between the two funnels , which was used to launch a Supermarine Walrus ( sometimes described as a Seagull V ) amphibious aircraft . The Walrus was operated by Royal Australian Air Force personnel from No. 5 Squadron RAAF ( which was redesignated No. 9 Squadron RAAF in 1939 ) . The 7 @-@ ton electric crane used to recover the aircraft also served to deploy most of the ship 's boats .

 Sydney completed working up trials before sailing from Portsmouth on 29 October 1935 , Captain <unk> Fitzgerald RN in command . Almost immediately after departing , Sydney was instructed to join the Royal Navy 's Mediterranean Fleet at Gibraltar and assist the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in enforcing economic sanctions against Italy in response to the Abyssinian crisis . During January 1936 , the cruiser underwent maintenance in Alexandria and visited medical facilities in Cyprus : cases of rubella and mumps had been circulating through the ship 's company since late 1935 . In March , Sydney was reassigned the 1st Cruiser Squadron , where she and the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia continued to enforce sanctions and participate in fleet exercises with Royal Navy units . Following the resolution of the Abyssinian crisis , Sydney departed for Australia on 14 July ; reaching Fremantle in late July before visiting Melbourne on 8 August and arriving in her namesake city three days later . 
 After reaching Australian waters , Sydney spent most of her time on fleet exercises and training cruises . In 1938 , the cruiser was one of several RAN units prepared to respond to the Munich crisis , but all ships stood down after the potential war was averted . From 17 to 19 April 1939 , Sydney was one of eight warships involved in a joint forces trade protection exercise off the south @-@ east Australian coast . In early August 1939 , Sydney was in Darwin , prior to visiting the Netherlands East Indies . However , in response to the events which prompted the start of World War II , Sydney was ordered to sail to Fremantle on a war footing , where she arrived on 22 August .

 Following the declaration of war , Sydney was instructed to carry out patrol and escort duties in Australian waters . Captain John Collins took over command of Sydney on 16 November . On 28 November , Sydney joined the Australian heavy cruisers Australia and Canberra in an unsuccessful four @-@ day search for the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee , which was known to be operating in the Indian Ocean . Sydney was relieved by HMAS Adelaide on 13 December , and sailed to Cockatoo Island in Sydney for a maintenance docking . The work was completed in late January 1940 , and as a shakedown cruise Sydney joined Canberra and the British ships Leander and Ramillies in escorting the Suez @-@ bound Anzac convoy US 1 ; Sydney broke off after the convoy left the east coast of Australia and returned to Sydney . Returning to Fremantle on 6 February , Sydney relieved Australia as the cruiser responsible for patrol and escort duties on the west coast . 
 On 19 April , Sydney joined the escort of Anzac convoy US 2 off Albany , and remained with the convoy until it reached the Cocos Island on 28 April and was replaced by French cruiser Suffren . The Australian cruiser set course for Fremantle , but on 1 May was assigned to the East Indies Station and rerouted to Colombo , where she arrived on 8 May . Arriving in Colombo on 8 May , Sydney was immediately tasked with meeting Anzac convoy US 3 off the Cocos Islands and escorting it across the Indian Ocean . The cruiser departed on 12 May , but while en route , she was instructed to make for the Mediterranean . Arriving back in Colombo on 18 May , Sydney replenished before sailing at high speed to Aden , where she arrived four days later . The Australian cruiser , accompanied by HM Ships Gloucester and Eagle , departed the next day , with the ships crossing the Suez Canal during the night of 25 – 26 May , and arriving in Alexandria that afternoon at 15 : 30 . Sydney was originally marked for operations in the Red Sea , but after observing the performance of an Australian five @-@ destroyer flotilla assigned to the British Mediterranean Fleet , Admiral Andrew Cunningham decided to " keep the Australian cruiser for himself " and attached Sydney to the Royal Navy 's 7th Cruiser Squadron .
